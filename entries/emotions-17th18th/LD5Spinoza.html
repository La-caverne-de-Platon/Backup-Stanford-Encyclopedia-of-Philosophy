<h3><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
Parts III-V of Spinoza&rsquo;s <em>Ethics</em> (ms. 1675), more than
half of the work, treat the definitions and classification of the
&ldquo;affects,&rdquo; the nature of bondage and the possibility of
freedom. Spinoza also treats particular emotions elsewhere, e.g., in
the <em>Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect</em> and the
<em>Short Treatise on God, Man and his Well-Being</em>. But I shall
concentrate on the <em>Ethics</em>, since it shows the centrality of
the emotions to Spinoza&rsquo;s conception of the human being and human
life and develops his signature distinction between
&lsquo;passions&rsquo; and &lsquo;afects.&rsquo; At the same time,
this text is an excellent example of how putting old wine in new
bottles can produce completely original potions.</p>

<p>
Following the &ldquo;geometrical method,&rdquo; Spinoza defines the
emotions, both individually and collectively, and draws out the
entailments of those definitions and other principles in various
propositions, scholia and corollaries. This is part of the
systematizing and reductive enterprise of the entire <em>Ethics</em>,
for which the ultimate goal is to explain freedom and
&ldquo;blessedness&rdquo; [<em>beatitudo</em>] as the knowledge of
God. Crucial to this project is the metaphysical status of the
affects, but not what Spinoza calls the &ldquo;external
affections.&rdquo; So compared to his predecessors, Spinoza shows
relatively little interest in bodily causes, symptoms and consequences
of the emotions, such as the movements of the heart and spirits or
facial expressions. Instead, bodily causes and effects only form part
of his project insofar as they are explanatory of the operations of
the mind &ndash; although even then, they do not constitute causes of
mental states. For Spinoza asserts that states, or
&ldquo;modes,&rdquo; of mind are at the same time states of the body,
just understood through a different attribute (IIP7s) &ndash; the view
commonly known as his &ldquo;parallelism.&rdquo; This term has come
under dispute by, e.g., Chantal Jaquet on the grounds that it
mischaracterizes the psychosomatic relation of &ldquo;equality,&rdquo;
requiring a kind of double account at every step. Instead, Jaquet
argues that Spinoza gives a mixed account that treats some affects as
purely psychical and others as psychophysical (Jaquet, 2018, 19, 136).
Nonetheless, differences in the attribute under which a particular
affective mode falls do not seem to give rise to systematic principles
of taxonomy.</p>

<h3><a name="SpiInf">2. Spinoza&rsquo;s Influences</a></h3>

<p>
Despite the claim prefacing Book III that &ldquo;no one, to my
knowledge has determined the nature and powers of the Affects, nor
what &hellip; the Mind can do to moderate them,&rdquo; Spinoza&rsquo;s
work shows clear influences from Descartes and Hobbes, as well as from
such ancient theories as Stoicism. The debt to Descartes is especially
marked, with the list of affects defined at the end of Book III drawn
mostly from the Latin translation of the <em>Passions of the Soul</em>
that appeared in Amsterdam in 1650 (see Wolfson 1934, 2: 209&ndash;210,
cited in Spinoza 1985, 531). But Spinoza&rsquo;s account differs in
several important respects: he lists contempt along with wonder
[<em>admiratio</em>], and counts neither as proper passions. Nor is
Spinoza slow to criticize Descartes. He rejects Descartes&rsquo;s
characterization of love (insofar as it involves imagining oneself
joined to the loved object); he dismisses the role given the pineal
gland as both anatomically incorrect and non-explanatory; and most
importantly, he denies that we can gain control over our passions,
holding that it is metaphysically impossible for the human mind to be
autonomous in the way he claims Descartes believed. On this last
point, Spinoza is even more at odds with the Stoics, although at the
same time he is quite sympathetic to their desire for escape from the
passions. Indeed, he shares with the Stoics an ideal of freedom, in
contrast with being hostage to fortune, in a world that unfolds
according to its own law. But just as he denies the possibility of
complete autonomy, so too does he reject the notion that a
&ldquo;good&rdquo; suicide might express such autonomy, holding
instead that any sort of self-destructive behavior is the result of
defeat by external causes (IVP18s, see also IVP20). And Spinoza&rsquo;s
vilification of the passions does not extend to emotions, or
&ldquo;affects,&rdquo; in general: he approves &ndash; in almost
Epicurean fashion &ndash; of moderate joy, the kind of joy associated
with activity.</p>

<p>
Spinoza&rsquo;s debt to Hobbes is less ambivalent than his borrowing
from other predecessors. Like Hobbes, Spinoza takes what is essential
to humans to be a kind of &ldquo;endeavour&rdquo; or conatus, which
strives fundamentally for self-preservation; he deems passions an
expression of this drive. Like Hobbes, Spinoza holds that the passions
endemic to human life breed conflict. And like Hobbes, he argues that
the disadvantages of the state of nature can be resolved through the
institution of a sovereign imposing a common and public measure for
right and wrong &ndash; although his conception of the sovereign (and
its relation to subjects) is radically different from Hobbes&rsquo;s and
he holds out the possibility of free and rational persons agreeing
without the need for a power to overawe them all. Spinoza may also
have a somewhat more censorious view of the passion Hobbes called
&ldquo;glory,&rdquo; at least when &ldquo;love of esteem&rdquo;
[<em>gloria</em>] becomes &ldquo;ambition&rdquo; [<em>ambitio</em>]
Ambition is an &ldquo;excessive desire for esteem,&rdquo; and Spinoza
cites Cicero (though with less irony than Montaigne) on the insidious
desire for ambition (III Def. of the Affects XLIV), which he maintains
strengthens all the affects and is itself almost impossible to
overcome. At the same time, Spinoza recognizes distinctive affects (or
affect-like states) directed towards God, which are central to his
picture of freedom from bondage and happiness.</p>

<h3><a name="TerAffPas">3. The Terminology of Affects and Passions</a></h3>

<p>
For all the mining of earlier sources, Spinoza&rsquo;s approach to the
emotions is distinctive, beginning with his vocabulary.
&lsquo;Passion&rsquo; is used narrowly, while the more inclusive term
is &lsquo;affect&rsquo; [<em>affectus</em>]. The affects, in turn, are
a species of &ldquo;affection&rdquo; [<em>affectio</em>], modification
or quality, a notion embedded deep in Spinoza&rsquo;s metaphysics. The
affects consist in &ldquo;the affections of the body whereby the
body&rsquo;s power of acting is increased or diminished &hellip;
together with the ideas of these affections&rdquo; (IIID3). But the
connection between the modifications of the body and ideas is not
quite as casual as this definition may sound. Spinoza&rsquo;s
parallelism holds that the mind is constituted by its idea of the
body; we become aware of the body, however, largely through its
changes. So it is really the affects &ndash; whether active or passive
&ndash; that constitute the mind. The relation of equality, even
identity, holding between mind and body further entails that the
affects involve both the body <em>and</em> the mind passing to a
greater or lesser perfection (without, of course, assuming any causal
link between the two). And although, Spinoza takes the mind&rsquo;s
striving for its own perfection to be tantamount (for the most part)
to striving for a more perfect body, the striving itself is best
explained through the economy of the affects.</p>

<p>
In contrast, Spinoza restricts the term &lsquo;passion&rsquo; to
affects that are passive: &ldquo;an affect that is called a Passion
[<em>pathema</em>] of the Mind is a confused idea by which the Mind
affirms of its Body, or some part of it, a greater or lesser power of
existing [<em>existendi vis</em>] than before, which, when it is given
determines the Mind to think of this rather than that&rdquo; (III Gen.
Def. of the Affects). What makes an affect a passion is that it is
confused, and therefore inadequate. That is, the mind is not the
adequate cause of the affect; rather, it responds to some external
thing, which can thus be considered the active cause. We turn passions
into actions insofar as we conceive some idea clearly and distinctly,
or adequately. It is in our interest to do so, since bondage to the
passions is not a happy state of affairs. Nevertheless, the experience
of some passions is part of the human condition, insofar as humans are
not God, but merely finite parts of the whole substance of the
universe.</p>

<p>
Spinoza recognizes various other states that are emotion-like, but
which he is reluctant to call passions, or even affects. For instance,
he discusses wonder and contempt among the passions, largely because
of their significance for theorists such as Descartes. But Spinoza
takes them to mark more the absence than the presence of a passion.
Moderation and related states indicate strength of mind, not the
affects thereby controlled. Fortitude, which may seem rather like
Descartes&rsquo;s &ldquo;generosity,&rdquo; is also a kind of mental
disposition or strength, as is mercy, a power of the mind.
Shamelessness, on the other hand, is an absence of affect (an affect
that we would normally expect). In a different vein, God&rsquo;s love
for himself cannot count as an affect, since God is immutable and this
love is essential to God. Similarly, humans&rsquo; intellectual love of
God and the blessedness [<em>beatitudo</em>], by which they approach
to God, do not seem a proper affects. (Jaquet proposes a sharp
distinction between the [<em>amor erga Deum</em>] [love towards God]
and the [<em>amor intellectis Deum</em>] [the intellectual love of
God], on the grounds that the former, but not the latter, is a proper
affect; see Jaquet 2018, 111&ndash;12). Other kinds of affects, e.g.,
cheerfulness, merriment, melancholy, and grief, are treated as
identical to pleasure and pain; they remain undefined because they are
purely bodily states, that is, kinds of pleasure and pain unmodified
by any other associated idea.</p>

<h3><a name="ExpCon">4. The Explanation of the Conatus</a></h3>

<p>
All of the affects proper derive from what is essential to the mind,
its conatus, or drive toward self-preservation. Because of this basis,
desire is central to the affects, indeed &ldquo;the very essence
<i>or</i> nature of each&rdquo; (IIIP56d; see also IIIP9s). The
affects can then be reduced to three primary affects, which are
&ldquo;nothing but these three [desire; joy or pleasure; and sadness
or pain], each one generally being called by a different name on
account of its varying relations and extrinsic denominations&rdquo;
(III Def of the Affects XLVIII). Pleasure, joy and delight
[<em>laetitia</em>] involve passing to state of greater perfection,
that is, to greater power. Pain, displeasure, and sorrow
[<em>tristitia</em>], in contrast, involve passing to state of lesser
perfection and power. Joy and sadness, however, are simply species of
desire: &ldquo;Desire, or Appetite itself insofar as it is increased
or diminished, aided or restrained, by external causes&rdquo;
(IIIP57d.) These affects are passions when the causes of the bodily
changes are (at least in part) external; they are thus ideas of such
things as increase or diminish the body&rsquo;s power of acting.</p>

<p>
Like Hobbes, Spinoza admits nothing &ldquo;except what follows from
the necessity of the &hellip; efficient cause&rdquo; (IV Preface) and
thus refuses to treat the conatus teleologically, or even
functionally. The affects and passions express this conatus, without
being designed for any end; they are merely appetites lacking final
causes. For this reason, Spinoza interprets the
&ldquo;perfection&rdquo; for which we strive as a matter of the
&ldquo;power of action.&rdquo; It is the force [<em>vis</em>] or
individual conatus expressing itself. One of Spinoza&rsquo;s most
general principles is that we all strive to preserve our own being, or
what comes to much the same thing, to increase our power of acting.
This explains the attractive and aversive aspects of joy and sadness,
which are simply the affects involved in a change in the power of
acting. It also explains why the distinction between active affects
and passions is important to Spinoza. The mind can act to pass to
greater perfection, that is, to preserve its own being and increase
its power of action; indeed insofar as it genuinely acts it is doing
both, and so acting as such generates affects (but not passions) of
joy and desire. By the same token, the mind feels no affects of
sadness insofar as it acts: painful passions are all passions, and as
such, involve passing to a state of lesser perfection. Only active
affects and those passions that signal an increase in our power of
acting are enjoyable. What appears as goal-driven pursuit of pleasure
can thus be understood simply as the built-in drive of our conatus.
But acting according to the dictates of our own nature pushes us to
overcome the <em>passions</em> in general, or when possible, to turn
them into active affects.</p>

<h3><a name="ClaAff">5. The Classification of the Affects</a></h3>

<p>
For all the rigors of the geometrical method, Spinoza does not seem to
place great stock in the details of his taxonomic scheme. He reduces
the affects to the three primary ones of desire, joy and sadness. But
he also maintains that there are as many kinds of passions as there
are different objects, so that the passions become innumerable. At the
same time, he denies &ndash; against a long tradition &ndash; that the
passions of joy or sadness should be differentiated according to the
temporality of their objects; considering an object by itself, or as
necessary, possible, or contingent does, however, make a real
difference to the strength of the felt passion. In general, Spinoza
differentiates passions on widely varying grounds. For instance,
whether a passion counts as &ldquo;scorn&rdquo; depends on the
fairness of judgment (although as a disposition to incorrectly assess
someone as worthless, this passion is a species of hate). And despite
refusing to treat wonder and disdain as full-blown affects, Spinoza
takes them to act as intensifiers that can be combined with other
affects to &ldquo;deduce more Affects than those which are usually
indicated by the accepted words&rdquo; (IIIP52s), e.g.,
&ldquo;devotion&rdquo; and &ldquo;mockery.&rdquo; Through such varying
and sometimes ad hoc means, Spinoza &ldquo;deduces&rdquo; more than
forty affects, although the lack of a tidy taxonomy makes it difficult
to determine the exact headcount (especially since he asserts that
several passions are more or less identical, while denying that other
states are genuine affects). Spinoza himself admits that &ldquo;from
what has already been said I believe it is clear to anyone that the
various affects can be compounded with one another in so many ways,
and that so many variations can arise from this composition that they
cannot be defined by any number&rdquo; (IIIP59s).</p>

<p>
Spinoza&rsquo;s nonchalance may be partially explained by his general
aims: &ldquo;to determine the powers of the affects and the power of
the mind over the affects.&rdquo; For that, &ldquo;it is enough to
have a general definition of each affect&rdquo; (IIIP56s), or indeed simply
&ldquo;to enumerate only the main affects&rdquo; (IIIP59s). What most
interests him in Parts III and IV is an account of the
&ldquo;movements&rdquo; of the affects &ndash; what produces them,
strengthens them, leads from one to another, and can weaken or
&ldquo;overcome&rdquo; them. Indeed, because they interact and spread
from one to another, the affects will be difficult to enumerate.</p>

<h3><a name="AssAff">6. The Association of Affects</a></h3>

<p>
These features of Spinoza&rsquo;s explanation of the affects produce an
associationist psychology, one that finds various causal and
explanatory relations to account for the spread of the affects. A
central aim of the <em>Ethics</em> is to show that the mind and its
affects are as much a part of the order of nature as is anything else.
And although that means that the affects are subject to
&ldquo;geometrical&rdquo; demonstration of the most rigorously
rational kind, it does not mean that the affects themselves answer to
rational norms, that is, that they appear in ways that would withstand
rational scrutiny. Instead, the affects can spread through
associations between their objects, including the most accidental of
associations in memory or imagination, as well as through causal
relations. For example, I may feel love towards something that
benefits something else that I already love; I may also feel love
towards something that was simply present on an occasion when I felt
pleasure. My passions can likewise give rise to prejudices, as when I
feel contempt for a person conceived &ldquo;under the universal name
of [some] class or nation&rdquo; (IIIP46), and so feel contempt for
all members of that class or nation. An affect can produce new affects
when the constitution of the body changes, e.g., appetite can turn to
disgust as we become sated. Affects can spread through our imagination
of the affects others feel. They can spread as we reflect on
ourselves, so when the mind considers itself and its power of acting,
it becomes more perfect, and thus experiences joy. And in particular,
they can spread as we reflect the passions that others feel back on
ourselves. Thus the appetite for approbation from others, which
Spinoza calls &ldquo;love of esteem&rdquo; (III Def. of the Affects
XXX; see also IIIP30) can turn into love for another if we imagine
that person feels love for us, as well as producing the pleasurable
affect of self-esteem, and further affects of thankfulness or
gratitude.</p>

<h3><a name="SocChaAff">7. The Social Character of the Affects</a></h3>

<p>
The associationism of the affects, thus, has a deeply social
component. Part of this social component is what Spinoza calls the
&ldquo;imitation of the affects.&rdquo; However, Spinoza differs
markedly from Malebranche by denying that the associationist spread of
the affects always tends to produce like from like. Not only does
Spinoza distinguish different passions depending on their direction
(love for another is not just the same as thankfulness for their love
for me), he also admits that they can move in contrary directions. If
I feel love for another, whom I imagine feels hate for me, my love can
turn into hate. As part of the order of nature, the associations
producing the passions and affects must be explicable, but it does not
follow that they are always the same.</p>

<p>
Spinoza likewise disputes Malebranche&rsquo;s functionalist assumption
that the communication of the passions tends to promote civil society.
For one, the affect of self-esteem allows us to conceive our power
more distinctly, adequately and actively insofar as we imagine other
people more disdainfully; thus, we are naturally prone to hatred and
envy. We can also come into conflict if we both love the same thing
and imagine that it cannot be possessed generally. True, Spinoza
allows that certain passions, e.g., pity, fear, lust, despondency, and
shame, can generate socially useful effects, but in general,
&ldquo;insofar as men are subject to passions, they cannot be said to
agree in nature&rdquo; (IVP32) and thus can be evil for each other (IV
P30d). Spinoza here adopts a Hobbesian approach to explain both how we
disagree &ldquo;in nature&rdquo; and how reason suggests articles of
peace to alleviate such natural disagreement.</p>

<h3><a name="PasRea">8. Passions and Reason</a></h3>

<p>
Very much like Hobbes, Spinoza poses a <em>prima facie</em> opposition
between reason, which provides a common and publicly accessible
understanding of the good, and divisive passions. Following reason,
men &ldquo;agree in nature;&rdquo; reason also produces the affects
and the strength of mind that promote sociability, so the reasonable
man is always &ldquo;just, honest and honorable,&rdquo; and wants for
others what they want for themselves (IVP18s). Moreover, whatever
useful effects might arise from the passions can arise just as well
from reason, without the possibility of conflict and disagreement.
However, following reason is nothing more than following the laws of
our own nature, acting on the conatus for self-preservation, and
seeking our own advantage. As did Hobbes, Spinoza calls this seeking
of our own advantage in general, and of self-preservation in
particular, the &ldquo;fundamental law of nature.&rdquo; And rational
reflection on the fundamental law shows the desirability of
cooperative endeavor:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip; to man, then, there is nothing more useful than man. Man, I
say, can wish for nothing more helpful to the preservation of his
being than that all should so agree in all things that the Minds and
Bodies of all would compose, as it were, one Mind and one Body; that
all should strive together, as far as they can, to preserve their
being; and that all, together, should seek for themselves the common
advantage of all. (IVP18s)
</blockquote>

<p>
On this basis, Spinoza identifies reason and virtue. Just because it
seeks our advantage (our enlightened self-interest), reason demands
that we seek the advantage of others. It also recommends that we give
up the right of nature to judge and act on all things for ourselves in
favor of a civil authority instituting a common standard that will
coordinate our conflicting passions. Moreover, reason suggests that we
adopt an affective policy that meets many intuitive considerations of
virtue, for instance, that we should return love for any passion
others might feel for us. Again, all this is driven by our seeking our
own advantage. But since Spinoza holds that one affect can only be
taken away by another affect, he recommends overcoming the
&ldquo;bondage&rdquo; of the passions by combating the passions with
active affects that increase our power. Exercising our reason, that
is, understanding the nature and connection of things is itself a way
of increasing our power, becoming more active, and passing to a state
of greater perfection. The exercise of reason thus generates joyful
affects that can help us to overcome bondage, even before we act on
its recommendations. Reasoning and acting on reason, then, are both
ways to preserve the mind and make it less vulnerable to external
degeneration. True, we will always be susceptible to external forces
that are stronger than we, but we can extend the reach and power of
our minds simply by reflecting on our own advantage, and even more so,
by acting in accord with our rational reflections.</p>

<h3><a name="AdeKnoFreBea">9. Adequate Knowledge, Freedom and Beatitude</a></h3>

<p>
The activity of our minds can be measured by the degree to which we
are causes of our own ideas, that is, by the adequacy of our ideas to
the whole sequence of causes and order of nature. As minds, then,
knowledge is our main good, particularly knowledge of God &ndash; that
is, knowledge of the whole, which is like that possessed by God. Our
striving, then, should be directed at what Spinoza identifies as
knowledge of either the second or the third kind. The former is
exemplified in the <em>Ethics</em>, where the whole is demonstrated in
geometrical fashion. The latter is intuitive knowledge of the whole,
the better kind of knowledge, which we should want for ourselves and
others. Spinoza takes it that this third kind of knowledge is the
closest we approach to God, and in it, we experience a love that is
part of the infinite love God has for itself. We thereby achieve what
Spinoza calls the state of &ldquo;beatitude.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Beatitude&rdquo; is not exactly an affect, but it is close: it
is &ldquo;that satisfaction of mind that stems from the intuitive
knowledge of God&rdquo; (IV Appendix IV). And the process of achieving
it should certainly involve the experience of many joyous affects.</p>

<p>
We have, then, for Spinoza a bit of a happy paradox: since we are
always subject to external causes, we can never be free from the
passions. But we can take a meta-stance as it were, by understanding
even our unhappy passions as things that happen according to the order
of nature. Thus, we will &ldquo;bear calmly those things which happen
to us contrary to what the principle of our advantage demands&rdquo;
(IV Appendix XXXII) Satisfaction comes from understanding, and insofar
as we have adequate ideas, we are active, thus increasing our power of
acting and preserving ourselves. So, insofar as we understand that
which is &ldquo;contrary to what the principle of our advantage
demands,&rdquo; we advance our advantage.</p>

<h3><a name="PasIde">10. The Passions and Identity</a></h3>

<p>
This point raises a question about whose advantage exactly is being
advanced when we understand &ndash; who, in fact, we are.
Spinoza&rsquo;s metaphysics does not ground human identity in the basic
metaphysical constitution of things: a human being is not an
independent substance and cannot be individuated by its real
distinction from all else. The human mind is constituted by its
affects, which insofar as they are active, and thus proper to the mind
itself, work to preserve its being, and increase its power of action.
Still, it is always dependent on and susceptible to what is outside
it. Something similar can be said for bodies too; they are not
substantially differentiated from the rest of the extended universe
with which they interact and on which they depend. But Spinoza&rsquo;s
parallelism (or &lsquo;equalism&rsquo;) means that an alternative,
less substantial account of how we individuate the human body can
capture mental identity in the same net. Spinoza provides such an
account in his understanding of how the bodily activity of the affects
preserves the relations and boundaries of our bodies, particularly the
proportion of motion and rest crucial to bodily identity and life. So,
the active affects maintain identity &ndash; the identity on which
they depend &ndash; by negotiating what systems theory calls a
&ldquo;systems-environment boundary.&rdquo; It is perfectly consistent
with the dynamically achieved identity of body, mind, and human being,
however, that we might take on yet other identities, identities that
may be equally important to us and equally &lsquo;ours.&rsquo; For
instance, Spinoza sometimes speaks of the society common to all humans
as a body seeking to preserve its own boundaries and proportions of
motion and rest, something that would give a physical grounding to
collective identity. Then too, insofar as we approach beatitude and
the intuitive knowledge of the whole, we may take on an identity
approaching to the identity of the whole, becoming more and more like
God. These remain mere speculations, though, unresolved in
Spinoza&rsquo;s work. Indeed, some of the puzzling passages at the end
of Part V appear torn between whether we should seek to
&ldquo;merge&rdquo; our individual mind with God or to preserve its
distinctive identity within the field of different, external, and
sometimes competing forces.</p>

<h3><a name="InfLatAut">11. Influences on Later Authors</a></h3>

<p>
Although both Leibniz and Hume take issue with different features of
his metaphysics, Spinoza&rsquo;s approach to the passions seems to have
exerted relatively little direct influence on his contemporaries.
There are similarities, of course: Hume complicates the understanding
of our psychological associations and how they can be transmitted
socially in ways not unlike Spinoza. Hume also talks about the
mechanisms by which we generate prejudices, although he will find
their source more in the causal associations of the imagination than
in the passions. But there is little evidence that these are anything
more than similarities, especially since Hume&rsquo;s knowledge of
Spinoza was transmitted largely through Bayle. It may be that
Spinoza&rsquo;s approach to the emotions is so closely intertwined with
the whole of his system that it is difficult to appropriate piecemeal,
and so remains <em>sui generis</em>. On the other hand, Spinoza was to
become an important figure for nineteenth-century philosophers, most
notably for Friedrich Nietzsche. In 1881, Nietzsche wrote his friend
Overbeck that he was &ldquo;astonished&rdquo; and &ldquo;utterly
enchanted&rdquo; to find in Spinoza a precursor insofar as they both
tend &ldquo;to make knowledge [<em>Erkenntnis</em>] the most powerful
affect&rdquo; (Nietzsche 1976, 92, translation slightly altered).
Nietzsche later singles out Spinoza&rsquo;s treatment of pity for praise
in the <em>Genealogy of Morals</em> (1887). More generally, his
understanding of the will to power shares a great deal with
Spinoza&rsquo;s understanding of our affective drive, although whether
this is a matter of direct influence or what Nietzsche might call a
common &ldquo;instinct&rdquo; is arguable.</p>

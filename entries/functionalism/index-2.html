<div id="preamble">

<p>
Functionalism in the philosophy of mind is the doctrine that what
makes something a mental state of a particular type does not depend on
its internal constitution, but rather on the way it functions, or the
role it plays, in the system of which it is a part. This doctrine is
rooted in Aristotle's conception of the soul, and has antecedents in
Hobbes's conception of the mind as a &ldquo;calculating
machine&rdquo;, but it has become fully articulated (and popularly
endorsed) only in the last third of the 20th century. Though the term
&lsquo;functionalism&rsquo; is used to designate a variety of
positions in a variety of other disciplines, including psychology,
sociology, economics, and architecture, this entry focuses exclusively
on functionalism as a philosophical thesis about the nature of mental
states.</p>

<p>
The following sections will trace the intellectual antecedents of
contemporary functionalism, sketch the different types of
functionalist theories, and discuss the most serious objections to
them.</p>

<h2><a name="WhaFun">1. What is Functionalism?</a></h2>

<p>
Functionalism is the doctrine that what makes something a thought,
desire, pain (or any other type of mental state) depends not on its
internal constitution, but solely on its function, or the role it
plays, in the cognitive system of which it is a part. More precisely,
functionalist theories take the identity of a mental state to be
determined by its causal relations to sensory stimulations, other
mental states, and behavior.</p>

<p>
For (an avowedly simplistic) example, a functionalist theory might
characterize <em>pain</em> as a state that tends to be caused by
bodily injury, to produce the belief that something is wrong with the
body and the desire to be out of that state, to produce anxiety, and,
in the absence of any stronger, conflicting desires, to cause wincing
or moaning. According to this theory, all and only creatures with
internal states that meet these conditions, or play these roles, are
capable of being in pain.</p>

<p>
Suppose that, in humans, there is some distinctive kind of neural
activity (C-fiber stimulation, for example) that meets these
conditions. If so, then according to this functionalist theory, humans
can be in pain simply by undergoing C-fiber stimulation. But the
theory permits creatures with very different physical constitutions to
have mental states as well: if there are silicon-based states of
hypothetical Martians or inorganic states of hypothetical androids
that also meet these conditions, then these creatures, too, can be in
pain. As functionalists often put it, pain can be <em>realized</em> by
different types of physical states in different kinds of creatures, or
<em>multiply realized</em>. (See entry on
 <a href="../multiple-realizability/index.html">multiple realizability</a>.)
 Indeed, since descriptions that make explicit reference only to a
state's causal relations with stimulations, behavior, and one another
are what have come to be known as &ldquo;topic-neutral&rdquo; (Smart
1959) &mdash; that is, as imposing no logical restrictions on the
nature of the items that satisfy the descriptions &mdash; then it's
also logically possible for <em>non</em>-physical states to play the
relevant roles, and thus realize mental states, in some systems as
well. So functionalism is compatible with the sort of dualism that
takes mental states to cause, and be caused by, physical states.</p>

<p>
Still, though functionalism is officially neutral between materialism
and dualism, it has been particularly attractive to materialists,
since many materialists believe (or argue; see Lewis, 1966) that it is
overwhelmingly likely that any states capable of playing the roles in
question will be physical states. If so, then functionalism can stand
as a materialistic alternative to the Psycho-Physical Identity Thesis
(introduced in Place 1956, Feigl 1958, and Smart 1959, and defended
more recently in Hill 1991, and Polger 2011), which holds that each
type of mental state is identical with a particular type of
<em>neural</em> state. This thesis seems to entail that no creatures
with brains unlike ours can share our sensations, beliefs, and
desires, no matter how similar their behavior and internal
organization may be to our own, and thus functionalism, with its claim
that mental states can be multiply realized, has been regarded as
providing a more inclusive, less &ldquo;(species-) chauvinistic&rdquo;
(Block 1980b) &mdash; theory of the mind that is compatible with
materialism. (More recently, however, some philosophers have contended
that the identity thesis may be more inclusive than functionalists
assume; see Section 6 for further discussion.)</p>

<p>
Within this broad characterization of functionalism, however, a number
of distinctions can be made. One of particular importance is the
distinction between theories in which the functional characterizations
of mental states purport to provide analyses of the meanings of our
mental state terms (or otherwise restrict themselves to a priori
information), and theories that permit functional characterizations of
mental states to appeal to information deriving from scientific
experimentation (or speculation). (See Shoemaker 1984c, and Rey 1997,
for further discussion and more fine-grained distinctions.) There are
other important differences among functionalist theories as well.
These (sometimes orthogonal) differences, and the motivations for
them, can best be appreciated by examining the origins of
functionalism and tracing its evolution in response both to explicit
criticisms of the thesis and changing views about the nature of
psychological explanation.</p>

<h2><a name="AntFun">2. Antecedents of Functionalism</a></h2>

<p>
Although functionalism attained its greatest prominence as a theory of
mental states in the last third of the 20th century, it has
antecedents in both modern and ancient philosophy, as well as in early
theories of computation and artificial intelligence.</p>

<h3><a name="EarAnt">2.1 Early Antecedents</a></h3>

<p>
The earliest view that can be considered an ancestor of functionalism
is Aristotle's theory of the soul (350 BCE). In contrast to Plato's
claim that the soul can exist apart from the body, Aristotle argued
(<em>De Anima</em> Bk. II, Ch. 1) that the (human) soul is the
<em>form</em> of a natural, organized human body &mdash; the set of
powers or capacities that enable it to express its &ldquo;essential
whatness&rdquo;, which for Aristotle is a matter of fulfilling the
function or purpose that defines it as the kind of thing it is. Just
as the form of an axe is whatever enables it to cut, and the form of
an eye is whatever enables it to see, the (human) soul is to be
identified with whichever powers and capacities enable a natural,
organized human body to fulfill its defining function, which,
according to Aristotle, is to survive and flourish as a living,
acting, perceiving, and reasoning being. So, Aristotle argues, the
soul is inseparable from the body, and comprises whichever capacities
are required for a body to live, perceive, reason, and act. (See
Shields, 1990, and Nelson, 1990, for further debate about whether
Aristotle's view can be considered to be a version of functionalism.)
</p>

<p>
A second, relatively early, ancestor of contemporary functionalism is
Hobbes's (1651) account of reasoning as a kind of computation that
proceeds by mechanistic principles comparable to the rules of
arithmetic. Reasoning, he argues, is &ldquo;nothing but
<em>reckoning</em>, that is adding and subtracting, of the
consequences of general names agreed upon for the <em>marking</em> and
<em>signifying</em> of our thoughts.&rdquo; (<em>Leviathan</em>, Ch.
5) In addition, Hobbes suggests that reasoning &mdash; along with
imagining, sensing, and deliberating about action, all of which
proceed according to mechanistic principles &mdash; can be performed
by systems of various physical types. As he puts it in his
Introduction to <em>Leviathan</em>, where he likens a commonwealth to
an individual human, &ldquo;why may we not say that all automata
(engines that move themselves by springs and wheels&hellip;) have an
artificial life? For what is the heart but a spring; and the nerves
but so many strings, and the joints but so many wheels&hellip;&rdquo;.
It was not until the middle of the 20th century, however, that it
became common to speculate that thinking may be nothing more than
rule-governed computation that can be carried out by creatures of
various physical types.</p>

<h3><a name="ThiMacTurTes">2.2 Thinking Machines and the &ldquo;Turing Test&rdquo;</a></h3>

<p>
In a seminal paper (Turing 1950), A.M. Turing proposed that the
question, &ldquo;Can machines think?&rdquo; can be replaced by the
question, &ldquo;Is it theoretically possible for a finite state
digital computer, provided with a large but finite table of
instructions, or program, to provide responses to questions that would
fool an unknowing interrogator into thinking it is a human
being?&rdquo; Now, in deference to its author, this question is most
often expressed as &ldquo;Is it theoretically possible for a finite
state digital computer (appropriately programmed) to pass the Turing
Test?&rdquo; (See Turing Test entry.)</p>

<p>
In arguing that this question is a legitimate replacement for the
original (and speculating that its answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;),
Turing identifies thoughts with states of a system defined solely by
their roles in producing further internal states and verbal outputs, a
view that has much in common with contemporary functionalist theories.
Indeed, Turing's work was explicitly invoked by many theorists during
the beginning stages of 20th century functionalism, and was the avowed
inspiration for a class of theories, the &ldquo;machine state&rdquo;
theories most firmly associated with Hilary Putnam (1960, 1967) that
had an important role in the early development of the doctrine. </p>

<h3><a name="Beh">2.3 Behaviorism</a></h3>

<p>
Other important recent antecedents of functionalism are the
behaviorist theories that emerged in the early-to-mid twentieth
century. These include both the empirical psychological theories
associated primarily with Watson and Skinner, and the
&ldquo;logical&rdquo; or &ldquo;analytical&rdquo; behaviorism of
philosophers such as Malcolm (1968) and Ryle (1949) (and, arguably,
Wittgenstein 1953). Though functionalism is significantly different
from behaviorism in that the latter attempts to explain behavior
without any reference whatsoever to mental states and processes, the
development of two important strains of functionalism,
&ldquo;psychofunctionalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;analytical&rdquo;
functionalism, can both be profitably viewed as attempts to rectify
the difficulties, respectively, of empirical and logical behaviorism,
while retaining certain important insights of those theories.</p>

<p>
As an empirical psychological theory, behaviorism holds that the
behavior of humans (and other animals) can be explained by appealing
solely to behavioral dispositions, that is, to the lawlike tendencies
of organisms to behave in certain ways, given certain environmental
stimulations. Behavioral dispositions, unlike thoughts, feelings, and
other internal states that can be directly observed only by
introspection, are objectively observable and are indisputably part of
the natural world. Thus they seemed to be fit entities to figure
centrally in the emerging science of psychology. Also, behaviorist
theories promised to avoid a potential regress that appeared to
threaten psychological explanations invoking internal representations,
namely, that to specify how such representations produce the behaviors
in question, one must appeal to an internal intelligent agent (a
&ldquo;homunculus&rdquo;) who interprets the representations, and
whose skills would themselves have to be explained.</p>

<p>
The promise of behaviorism lay in its conviction that there could be a
science of human behavior as objective and explanatory as other
&ldquo;higher-level&rdquo; sciences such as chemistry and biology.
Behaviorism indeed had some early successes, especially in the domain
of animal learning, and its principles are still used, at least for
heuristic purposes, in various areas of psychology. But as many
psychologists (and others, e.g. Chomsky 1959) have argued, the
successes of behaviorism seem to depend upon the experimenters'
implicit control of certain variables which, when made explicit,
involve ineliminable reference to organisms' other mental states. For
example, rats are typically placed into an experimental situation at a
certain fraction of their normal body weight &mdash; and thus can be
assumed to <em>feel</em> <em>hunger</em> and to <em>want</em> the food
rewards contingent upon behaving in certain ways. Similarly, it is
assumed that humans, in analogous experimental situations,
<em>want</em> to cooperate with the experimenters, and
<em>understand</em> and know how to follow the instructions. It seemed
to the critics of behaviorism, therefore, that theories that
explicitly appeal to an organism's beliefs, desires, and other mental
states, as well as to stimulations and behavior, would provide a
fuller and more accurate account of why organisms behave as they do.
They could do so, moreover, without compromising the objectivity of
psychology as long as the mental states to which these theories appeal
are introduced as states that <em>together play a role</em> in the
production of behavior, rather than states identifiable solely by
introspection. Thus work was begun on a range of
&ldquo;cognitive&rdquo; psychological theories which reflected these
presumptions, and an important strain of contemporary functionalism,
&ldquo;psycho-functionalism&rdquo; (Fodor 1968, Block and Fodor 1972)
can be seen a philosophical endorsement of these new cognitive
theories of mind.</p>

<p>
Logical behaviorism, in contrast to behaviorism as a psychological
theory, is a thesis about the meanings of our mental state terms or
concepts. According to logical behaviorism, all statements about
mental states and processes are equivalent in meaning to statements
about behavioral dispositions. So, for (again, an overly simplified)
example, &ldquo;Henry has a toothache&rdquo; would be equivalent in
meaning to a statement such as &ldquo;Henry is disposed (all things
being equal) to cry out or moan and to rub his jaw&rdquo;. And
&ldquo;Amelia is thirsty&rdquo; would be equivalent to a statement
such as &ldquo;If Amelia is offered some water, she will be disposed
(all things being equal) to drink it.&rdquo; These candidate
translations, like all behavioristic statements, eschew reference to
any internal states of the organism, and thus do not threaten to
denote, or otherwise induce commitment to, properties or processes
(directly) observable only by introspection. In addition, logical
behaviorists argued that if statements about mental states were
equivalent in meaning to statements about behavioral dispositions,
there could be an unproblematic account of how mental state terms
could be applied both to oneself and others, and how they could be
taught and learned.</p>

<p>
However, as many philosophers have pointed out (Chisholm 1957; Geach
1957), logical behaviorism provides an implausible account of the
meanings of our mental state terms, since, intuitively, a subject can
have the mental states in question without the relevant behavioral
dispositions &mdash; and vice versa. For example, Gene may believe
that it's going to rain even if he's not disposed to wear a raincoat
and take an umbrella when leaving the house (or to perform any other
cluster of rain-avoiding behaviors), if Gene doesn't mind, or actively
enjoys, getting wet. And subjects with the requisite motivation can
suppress their tendencies to pain behavior even in the presence of
excruciating pain, while skilled actors can perfect the lawlike
disposition to produce pain behavior under certain conditions, even if
they don't actually feel pain. (Putnam 1965) The problem, these
philosophers argued, is that no mental state, by itself, can be
plausibly assumed to give rise to any particular behavior unless one
also assumes that the subject possesses additional mental states of
various types. And so, it seemed, it was not in fact possible to give
meaning-preserving translations of statements invoking pains, beliefs,
and desires in purely behavioristic terms. Nonetheless, the idea that
our common sense concepts of mental states reveal an essential tie
between mental states and their typical behavioral expressions is
retained, and elaborated, in contemporary &ldquo;analytic&rdquo;
functionalist theories.</p>

<h2><a name="VarFun">3. Varieties of Functionalism</a></h2>

<p>
Given this history, it is helpful to think of functionalist theories
as belonging to one of three major strains &mdash; &ldquo;machine
functionalism&rdquo;, &ldquo;psychofunctionalism&rdquo; and
&ldquo;analytic functionalism&rdquo; &mdash; and to see them as
emerging, respectively, from early AI theories, empirical behaviorism,
and logical behaviorism. It's important to recognize, however, that
there is at least some overlap in the bloodlines of these different
strains of functionalism, and also that there are functionalist
theories, both earlier and more recent, that fall somewhere in
between. For example, Wilfrid Sellars's (1956) account of mental
states as &ldquo;theoretical entities&rdquo; is widely regarded as an
important early version of functionalism, but it takes the proper
characterization of thoughts and experiences to depend partially on
their role in providing a scientific explanation of behavior, and
partly on what he calls the &ldquo;logic&rdquo;, or the a priori
interrelations, of the relevant concepts. Still, it is instructive to
give separate treatment to the three major strains of the doctrine, as
long as these caveats are kept in mind.</p>

<h3><a name="MacStaFun">3.1 Machine State Functionalism</a></h3>

<p>
The early functionalist theories of Putnam (1960, 1967) can be seen as
a response to the difficulties facing behaviorism as a scientific
psychological theory, and as an endorsement of the (new) computational
theories of mind which were becoming increasingly significant rivals
to it. (But see Putnam 1988, for subsequent doubts about machine
functionalism, Chalmers 1996b, for a response, and Shagrir 2005, for a
comprehensive account of the evolution of Putnam's views on the
subject)</p>

<p>
According to Putnam's <em>machine state functionalism</em>, any
creature with a mind can be regarded as a Turing machine (an idealized
finite state digital computer), whose operation can be fully specified
by a set of instructions (a &ldquo;machine table&rdquo; or program)
each having the form:</p>

<blockquote>
If the machine is in state <em>S<sub>i</sub></em>, and receives input
<em>I<sub>j</sub></em>, it will go into state <em>S<sub>k</sub></em>
and produce output <em>O<sub>l</sub></em> (for a finite number of
states, inputs and outputs).
</blockquote>

<p>
A machine table of this sort describes the operation of a
<em>deterministic</em> automaton, but most machine state
functionalists (e.g. Putnam 1967) take the proper model for the mind
to be that of a <em>probabilistic</em> automaton: one in which the
program specifies, for each state and set of inputs, the
<em>probability</em> with which the machine will enter some subsequent
state and produce some particular output.</p>

<p>
On either model, however, the mental states of a creature are to be
identified with such &ldquo;machine table states&rdquo;
(<em>S<sub>1</sub></em>,&hellip;,<em>S<sub>n</sub></em>). These states
are not mere behavioral dispositions, since they are specified in
terms of their relations not only to inputs and outputs, but also to
the state of the machine at the time. For example, if <em>believing it
will rain</em> is regarded as a machine state, it will not be regarded
as a disposition to take one's umbrella after looking at the weather
report, but rather as a disposition to take one's umbrella if one
looks at the weather report <em>and</em> is in the state of wanting to
stay dry. So machine state functionalism can avoid what many have
thought to be a fatal difficulty for behaviorism. In addition,
machines of this sort provide at least a simple model of how internal
states whose effects on output occur by means of mechanical processes
can be viewed as <em>representations</em> (though the question of
<em>what</em>, exactly, they represent has been an ongoing topic of
discussion (see sections 4.4&ndash;5). Finally, machine table states
are not tied to any particular physical (or other) realization; the
same program, after all, can be run on different sorts of computer
hardware.</p>

<p>
It's easy to see, therefore, why Turing machines provided a fruitful
model for early functionalist theories. However, because machine table
states are total states of a system, the early functionalist equation
of mental states with machine table states faded in importance as a
model for the functional characterization of the complex of distinct
internal states that can be simultaneously realized in a human (or
other) subject (Block and Fodor 1972; Putnam 1973). Nonetheless, the
idea that internal states can be fully described in terms of their
relations to input, output, and <em>one another</em>, and can figure
in lawlike descriptions, and predictions, of a system's output, was a
rich and important idea that is retained by contemporary functionalist
theories. And many functionalists (e.g. Rey 1997) argue that mental
states are best regarded as computational states (but see Piccinini
2004 for dissent and the entry
 <a href="../computational-mind/index.html">The Computational Theory of Mind</a>
 for a comprehensive discussion of this question). </p>

<h3><a name="PsyFun">3.2 Psycho-Functionalism</a></h3>

<p>
A second strain of functionalism, psycho-functionalism, derives
primarily from reflection upon the goals and methodology of
&ldquo;cognitive&rdquo; psychological theories. In contrast to the
behaviorists' insistence that the laws of psychology appeal only to
behavioral dispositions, cognitive psychologists argue that the best
empirical theories of behavior take it to be the result of a complex
of mental states and processes, introduced and individuated in terms
of the roles they play in producing the behavior to be explained. For
example (Fodor's, in his 1968, Ch. 3), a psychologist may begin to
construct a theory of memory by postulating the existence of
&ldquo;memory trace&rdquo; decay, a process whose occurrence or
absence is responsible for effects such as memory loss and retention,
and which is affected by stress or emotion in certain distinctive
ways.</p>

<p>
On a theory of this sort, what makes some neural process an instance
of memory trace decay is a matter of how it functions, or the role it
plays, in a cognitive system; its neural or chemical properties are
relevant only insofar as they enable that process to do what trace
decay is hypothesized to do. And similarly for all mental states and
processes invoked by cognitive psychological theories. Cognitive
psychology, that is, is intended by its proponents to be a
&ldquo;higher-level&rdquo; science like biology, and thus to have
autonomy from lower-level sciences such as neurophysiology: just as,
in biology, physically disparate entities can all be hearts as long as
they function to circulate blood in a living organism, and physically
disparate entities can all be eyes as long as they enable an organism
to see, disparate physical structures or processes can be instances of
memory trace decay &mdash; or more familiar phenomena such as
thoughts, sensations, and desires &mdash; as long as they play the
roles described by the relevant cognitive theory.</p>

<p>
Psycho-functionalism, therefore, can be seen as straightforwardly
adopting the methodology of cognitive psychology in its
characterization of mental states and processes as entities defined by
their role in a cognitive psychological theory. All versions of
functionalism, however, can be regarded as characterizing mental
states in terms of their roles in <em>some</em> psychological theory
or other. (A more formal account of this will be given in Section 4.1
below.) What is distinctive about psycho-functionalism is its claim
that mental states and processes are just those entities, with just
those properties, postulated by the best <em>scientific</em>
explanation of human behavior. This means, first, that the form of the
theory can diverge from the &ldquo;machine table&rdquo; specifications
of machine state functionalism. It also means that the information
used in the functional characterization of mental states and processes
needn't be restricted to what is considered common knowledge or common
sense, but can include information available only by careful
laboratory observation and experimentation. For example, a
psychofunctional theory might be able to distinguish phenomena such as
depression from sadness or listlessness even though the distinctive
causes and effects of these syndromes are difficult to untangle solely
by consulting intuitions or appealing to common sense. And
psychofunctional theories will not include characterizations of mental
states for which there is no scientific evidence, such as buyer's
regret or hysteria, even if the existence and efficacy of such states
is something that common sense affirms.</p>

<p>
This may seem to be an unmitigated advantage, since psycho-functional
theories can avail themselves of all the tools of inquiry available to
scientific psychology, and will presumably make all, and only, the
distinctions that are scientifically sound. This methodology, however,
leaves psycho-functionalism open to the charge that it, like the
Psycho-Physical Identity Thesis, may be overly
&ldquo;chauvinistic&rdquo; (Block 1980b), since creatures whose
internal states share the rough, but not fine-grained, causal patterns
of ours wouldn't count as sharing our mental states. Many
psycho-functionalists may not regard this as an unhappy consequence,
and argue that it's appropriate to treat only those who are
psychologically similar as having the same mental states. But there is
a more serious worry about the thesis, namely, that if the laws of the
best empirical psychological theories diverge from even the broad
contours of our &ldquo;folk psychology&rdquo; &mdash; that is, our
common sense beliefs about the causal roles of our thoughts,
sensations, and perceptions &mdash; it will be hard to take
psycho-functional theories as providing an account of our mental
states, rather than merely changing the subject (Loar 1981, Stich
1983, Greenwood 1991). Many theorists, however (Horgan and Woodward
1985), argue that it's likely that future psychological theories will
be recognizably close to &ldquo;folk psychology&rdquo;, though this
question has been the subject of debate (Churchland 1981).</p>

<p>
But there is another important strain of functionalism,
&ldquo;analytic&rdquo; functionalism, that takes there to be reason to
restrict the defining theory not just to generalizations sufficiently
close to those that &ldquo;the folk&rdquo; take to hold between mental
states, environmental stimulations, and behavior, but rather to <em>a
priori</em> information about these relations. (See Smart 1959,
Armstrong 1968, Shoemaker 1984a,b,c, Lewis 1972, and Braddon-Mitchell
and Jackson 1996/2007.) This is because, for analytic functionalists,
there are equally important goals that require strictly a priori
characterizations of mental states.</p>

<h3><a name="AnaFun">3.3 Analytic Functionalism</a></h3>

<p>
Like the logical behaviorism from which it emerged, the goal of
analytic functionalism is to provide &ldquo;topic-neutral&rdquo;
translations, or analyses, of our ordinary mental state terms or
concepts. Analytic functionalism, of course, has richer resources than
logical behaviorism for such translations, since it permits reference
to the causal relations that a mental state has to stimulations,
behavior, <em>and other mental states</em>. Thus the statement
&ldquo;Blanca wants some coffee&rdquo; need not be rendered, as
logical behaviorism requires, in terms such as &ldquo;Blanca is
disposed to order coffee when it is offered&rdquo;, but rather as
&ldquo;Blanca is disposed to order coffee when it is offered,
<em>if</em> she has no stronger desire to avoid coffee&rdquo;. But
this requires any functional &ldquo;theory&rdquo; acceptable to
analytic functionalists to include only generalizations about mental
states, their environmental causes, and their joint effects on
behavior that are so widely known and &ldquo;platitudinous&rdquo; as
to count as <em>analyzing our ordinary concepts</em> of the mental
states in question.</p>

<p>
A good way to see why analytic functionalists insist that functional
characterizations provide meaning analyses is to revisit a debate that
occurred in the early days of the Psycho-Physical Identity Theory, the
thesis that each type of mental state can be identified with some type
of brain state or neural activity. For example, early identity
theorists (e.g. Smart 1959) argued that it makes perfect sense (and
may well be true) to identify <em>pain</em> with <em>C-fiber
stimulation</em>. The terms &lsquo;pain&rsquo; and &lsquo;C-fiber
stimulation&rsquo;, they acknowledged, do not have the same
<em>meaning</em>, but nonetheless they can denote the same state; the
fact that an identity statement is not a priori, they argued, does not
mean that it is not true. And just because I need not consult some
sort of brain scanner when reporting that I'm in pain doesn't mean
that the pain I report is not a neural state that a brain scanner
could (in principle) detect.</p>

<p>
An important &mdash; and enduring &mdash; objection to this argument,
however, was raised early on by Max Black (reported in Smart 1959).
Black argued, following Frege (1892), that the only way that terms
with different meanings can denote the same state is to express
different properties, or &ldquo;modes of presentation&rdquo; of that
state. But this implies, he argued, that if terms like
&lsquo;pain&rsquo;, &lsquo;thought&rsquo; and &lsquo;desire&rsquo; are
not equivalent in meaning to any physicalistic descriptions, they can
denote physical states only by expressing <em>irreducibly mental</em>
<em>properties</em> of them. Thus, even if &lsquo;pain&rsquo; and
&lsquo;C-fiber stimulation&rsquo; pick out a single type of neural
state, this state must have two types of <em>properties</em>, physical
and mental, by means of which the identification can be made. This
argument has come to be known as the &ldquo;Distinct Property
Argument&rdquo;, and is taken by its proponents to undermine a
thorough-going materialistic theory of the mind. (See White 1986 and
2007, for more recent versions of this argument, and Block 2007, for a
response.)</p>

<p>
The appeal of meaning-preserving functional characterizations,
therefore, is that in providing topic-neutral equivalents of our
mental state terms and concepts, they blunt the anti-materialistic
force of the Distinct Property Argument. True enough, analytic
functionalists can acknowledge, terms like &lsquo;pain&rsquo;,
&lsquo;thought&rsquo;, and &lsquo;desire&rsquo; are not equivalent to
any descriptions expressed in the language of physics, chemistry, or
neurophysiology. But if there are <em>functional</em> descriptions
that preserve the meanings of these terms, then a creature's mental
states can be identified simply by determining which of that
creature's internal states and processes play the relevant functional
roles (see Lewis 1966). And since the capacity to play these roles is
merely a matter of having certain causal relations to stimulations,
behavior, and one another, the possession of these properties is
compatible with a materialistic theory of the mind.</p>

<p>
A major question, of course, is whether a theory that limits itself to
a priori information about the causal relations between stimulations,
mental states, and behavior can make the right distinctions among
mental states. This question will be pursued further in Section 4.</p>

<h3><a name="RolFunReaFun">3.4 Role-functionalism and Realizer-functionalism</a></h3>

<p>
There is yet another distinction between kinds of functional theory
&mdash; one that crosscuts the distinctions described so far &mdash;
that is important to note. This is the distinction between what has
come to be known as &ldquo;role&rdquo; functionalism and
&ldquo;realizer&rdquo; (or &ldquo;filler&rdquo;) functionalism
(McLaughlin 2006). To see the difference between these types of
theory, consider&mdash;once again&mdash;the (avowedly simplistic)
example of a functional theory of pain introduced in the first
section.</p>

<blockquote>
<em>Pain</em> is the state that tends to be caused by bodily injury,
to produce the belief that something is wrong with the body and the
desire to be out of that state, to produce anxiety, and, in the
absence of any stronger, conflicting desires, to cause wincing or
moaning.
</blockquote>

<p>
As noted earlier, if in humans this functional role is played by
C-fiber stimulation, then, according to this functionalist theory,
humans can be in pain simply by undergoing C-fiber stimulation. But
there is a further question to be answered, namely, what is the
property of pain itself? Is it the higher-level relational property of
being in some state or other that plays the &ldquo;pain role&rdquo;in
the theory, or the C-fiber stimulation that actually plays this
role?</p>

<p>
Role functionalists identify pain with that higher-level relational
property. Realizer functionalists, however, take a functional theory
merely to provide definite descriptions of whichever
<em>lower-level</em> properties satisfy the functional
characterizations. On these views (also called &ldquo;functional
specification&rdquo; theories), if the property that occupies the
causal role of pain in human beings is C-fiber stimulation, then pain
(or at least pain-in-humans) would <em>be</em> C-fiber stimulation,
rather than the higher-level property of having some lower-level state
that plays the relevant role. (This is not to suggest that there is a
difference in kind between higher-level &ldquo;role&rdquo; properties
and the lower-level &ldquo;realizations&rdquo; of those roles, since
it may be that, relative to even lower-level descriptions, those
realizations can be characterized as functional states themselves
(Lycan 1987).</p>

<p>
Some of the earliest versions of analytic functionalism (Lewis 1966,
Armstrong 1968 &mdash; but see Lewis 1980, for a modification) were
presented as functional specification theories, as topic-neutral
&ldquo;translations&rdquo; of mental state terms that could pave the
way for a psycho-physical identity theory by defusing the Distinct
Property Argument (see section 3.3). However, if there are differences
in the physical states that satisfy the functional definitions in
different (actual or hypothetical) creatures, such theories&mdash;like
most versions of the identity theory&mdash;would violate a key
motivation for functionalism, namely, that creatures with states that
play the same role in the production of other mental states and
behavior possess, literally, the same mental states. </p>

<p>
It may be that there are some important, more general, physical
similarities between the neural states of seemingly disparate
creatures that satisfy a given functional characterization (see
Bechtel and Mundale 1999, Churchland 2005, and Polger and Shapiro,
2012&mdash;but see Aizawa and Gillett, 2009 for dissent; this issue
will be discussed further in Section 6). However, even if this is so,
it is unlikely that these similarities hold of <i>all</i> the
creatures, including Martians and other hypothetical beings, who could
share our functional organization, and thus our theory of mental
states would remain, in Block's (1980) terms, overly
&ldquo;chauvinistic&rdquo;. One could counter the charge of
chauvinism, of course, by suggesting that all creatures with
lower-level states that satisfy a given functional characterization
possess a common (lower-level) <i>disjunctive</i> state or property.
Or one could suggest that, even if all creatures possessing states
that occupy (for example) the pain role are not literally in the same
mental state, they nonetheless share a closely related higher-level
property (call it, following Lewis 1966 (note 6), &ldquo;the attribute
of having pain&rdquo;). But neither alternative, for many
functionalists, goes far enough to preserve the basic functionalist
intuition that functional commonality trumps physical diversity in
determining whether creatures can possess the same mental states. Thus
many functionalists&mdash;both a priori and empirical&mdash;advocate
role functionalism, which, in addition to avoiding chauvinism, permits
mental state terms to be rigid designators (Kripke 1972), denoting the
same items&mdash;those higher-level &ldquo;role&rdquo;
properties&mdash;in all possible worlds. </p>

<p>
On the other hand, some functionalists&mdash;here, too, both a priori
and empirical&mdash;consider realizer functionalism to be in a better
position than role functionalism to explain the causal efficacy of the
mental. If I stub my toe and wince, we believe that my toe stubbing
causes my pain, which in turn causes my wincing. But, some have argued
(Malcolm 1968; Kim 1989, 1998), if pain is realized in me by some
neural event-type, then insofar as there are purely physical law-like
generalizations linking events of that type with wincings, one can
give a complete causal explanation of my wincing by citing the
occurrence of that neural event (and the properties by virtue of which
it figures in those laws). And thus it seems that the higher-level
role properties of that event are causally irrelevant. This is known
as the &ldquo;causal exclusion problem&rdquo;, which is claimed to
arise not just for functional role properties, but for dispositional
properties in general (Prior, Pargetter, and Jackson 1982)&mdash;and
indeed for any sort of mental states or properties not type-identical
to those invoked in physical laws. This problem will be discussed
further in Section 5.2.</p>

<h2><a name="ConPlaFunThe">4. Constructing Plausible Functional Theories</a></h2>

<p>
So far, the discussion of how to provide functional characterizations
of individual mental states has been vague, and the examples avowedly
simplistic. Is it possible to do better, and, if so, which version of
functionalism is likely to have the greatest success? These questions
will be the focus of this section, and separate treatment will be
given to experiential (often called 'qualitative' or 'phenomenal')
states, such as perceptions and bodily sensations, which have a
distinctive qualitative character or &ldquo;feel&rdquo;, and
intentional states, such as thoughts, beliefs, and desires, which
purport to represent the world in various ways To be sure, there is
increasing consensus that experiential states have representational
contents and intentional states have qualitative character and thus
that these two groups may not be mutually exclusive (see Horgan and
Tienson, 2002). Nonetheless I will discuss them separately to focus on
what all agree to be the distinctive features of each. </p>

<p>
First, however, it is important to get more precise about how exactly
functional definition is supposed to work. This can be done by
focusing on a general method for constructing functional definitions
introduced by David Lewis (1972; building on an idea of Frank
Ramsey's), which has become standard practice for functionalists of
all varieties. Articulating this method will help in evaluating the
strengths and weaknesses of the different varieties of
functionalism&mdash;while displaying some further challenges that
arise for them all.</p>

<h3><a name="FunDefRamSen">4.1 Functional Definitions and Ramsey-sentences</a></h3>

<p>
The key feature of this now-canonical method is to treat mental states
and processes as being implicitly defined by the <em>Ramsey
sentence</em> of one or another psychological theory &mdash; common
sense, scientific, or something in between. (Analogous steps, of
course, can be taken to produce the Ramsey-sentence of <em>any</em>
theory, psychological or otherwise). For (a still simplistic) example,
consider the sort of generalizations about pain introduced before:
pain tends to be caused by bodily injury; pain tends to produce the
belief that something is wrong with the body and the desire to be out
of that state; pain tends to produce anxiety; pain tends to produce
wincing or moaning.</p>

<p>
To construct the Ramsey-sentence of this &ldquo;theory&rdquo;, the
first step is to conjoin these generalizations, then replace all names
of different types of mental states with different variables, and then
existentially quantify those variables, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
&exist;<em>x</em>&exist;<em>y</em>&exist;<em>z</em>&exist;<em>w</em>(<em>x</em>
tends to be caused by bodily injury &amp; <em>x</em> tends to produce
states <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>, and <em>w</em> &amp; <em>x</em> tends
to produce wincing or moaning).
</blockquote>

<p>
Such a statement is free of any mental state terms. It includes only
<em>quantifiers</em> that range over mental states, terms that denote
stimulations and behavior, and terms that specify various causal
relations among them. It can thus be regarded as providing implicit
definitions of the mental state terms of the theory. An individual
will have those mental states just in case it possesses a family of
first-order states that interact in the ways specified by the theory.
(Though functionalists of course acknowledge that the first-order
states that satisfy the functional definitions may vary from species
to species &mdash; or even from individual to individual &mdash; they
specify that, for each individual, the functional definitions be
<em>uniquely</em> satisfied.)</p>

<p>
A helpful way to think of the Ramsey sentence of a psychological
theory is to regard it as defining a system's mental states &ldquo;all
at once&rdquo; as states that interact with stimulations in various
ways to produce behavior (See Lewis 1972; also see Field 1980 for a
more technical elaboration of Lewis's method, and an account of some
crucial differences between this kind of characterization and the one
Lewis initially proposed.) This makes it clear that, in the classic
formulations of functional theories, mental states are intended to be
characterized in terms of their relations to stimulations, behavior,
and <em>all the other states</em> that may be permissibly invoked by
the theory in question, and thus certain functional theories may have
more resources for individuating mental states than suggested by the
crude definitions used as examples. The next three sections will
discuss the potential of various sorts of functionalist theory for
giving adequate characterizations of experiential and intentional
states&mdash;and also for specifying the inputs and outputs of the
system. </p>

<h3><a name="ChaExpSta">4.2 Characterizing Experiential States</a></h3>

<p>
The common strategy in the most successful treatments of perceptual
experiences and bodily sensations (Shoemaker 1984a, Clark 1993;
adumbrated in Sellars 1956) is to individuate experiences of various
general types (color experiences, experiences of sounds, feelings of
temperature) in part by appeal to their positions in the
&ldquo;quality spaces&rdquo; associated with the relevant sense
modalities &mdash; that is, the (perhaps multidimensional) matrices
determined by judgments about the relative similarities and
differences among the experiences in question. So, for example, the
experience of a very reddish-orange could be (partially) characterized
as the state produced by the viewing of a color swatch within some
particular range, which tends to produce the judgment or belief that
the state just experienced is more similar to the experience of red
than of orange. (Analogous characterizations, of course, will have to
be given of these other color experiences.) The judgments or beliefs
in question will themselves be (partially) characterized in terms of
their tendencies to produce sorting or categorization behavior of
certain specified kinds.</p>

<p>
This strategy may seem fatal to analytic functionalism, which
restricts itself to the use of a priori information to distinguish
among mental states, since it's not clear that the information needed
to distinguish among experiences such as color perceptions will result
from conceptual analysis of our mental state terms or concepts.
However, this problem may not be as dire as it seems. For example, if
sensations and perceptual experiences are characterized in terms of
their places in a &ldquo;quality space&rdquo; determined by a person's
pre-theoretical judgments of similarity and dissimilarity (and perhaps
also in terms of their tendencies to produce various emotional
effects), then these characterizations may qualify as <em>a
priori</em>, even though they would have to be elicited by a kind of
&ldquo;Socratic questioning&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
There are limits to this strategy, however (see Section 5.5.1 on the
&ldquo;inverted spectrum&rdquo; problem), which seem to leave two
options for analytic functionalists: fight &mdash; that is, deny that
it's coherent to suppose that there are the distinctions that the
critics suggest, or switch &mdash; that is, embrace another version of
functionalism in which the characterizations of mental states, though
not conceptual truths, can provide information rich enough to
individuate the states in question. To switch, however, would be to
give up the benefits (if any) of a theory that offers
meaning-preserving translations of our mental state terms.</p>

<p>
There has been significant skepticism, however, about whether any
functionalist theory &mdash; analytic or scientific &mdash; can
capture what seems to be the distinctive qualitative character of
experiential states such as color perceptions, pains, and other bodily
sensations; these questions will be addressed in section 5.5
below.</p>

<h3><a name="ChaIntSta">4.3 Characterizing Intentional States</a></h3>

<p>
On the other hand, intentional states such as beliefs, thoughts, and
desires (sometimes called &ldquo;propositional attitudes&rdquo;) have
often been thought to be easier to characterize functionally than
experiential states such as pains and color experiences (but not
always: see Searle 1992, G. Strawson 1994, Horgan and Tienson 2002,
Kriegel 2003, and Pitt 2008, who suggest that intentional states have
qualitative character as well). We can begin by characterizing beliefs
as (among other things) states produced in certain ways by
sense-perception or inference from other beliefs, and desires as
states with certain causal or counterfactual relations to the system's
goals and needs, and specify further how (according to the relevant
common sense or empirical theory) beliefs and desires tend to interact
with one another, and other mental states, to produce behavior. </p>

<p>
Once again, this characterization is crude, and needs more detail.
Moreover, there are some further questions about characterizing
intentional states&mdash;particularly belief&mdash; that have emerged
in recent discussions. Once is whether a subject should be regarded as
believing that p if there is a mismatch between her avowals that p and
the characteristic behaviors associated with believing that p in
standard circumstances: do avowals outweigh behaviors, or vice
versa&mdash;or are there pragmatic factors that determine what the
answer should be in different contexts? (See Gendler, 2008, and
Schwitzgebel, 2010). Another question is whether the states that
interact with desires (and other mental states) to produce behavior
are best regarded as &ldquo;full on&rdquo; or &ldquo;outright&rdquo;
beliefs, or rather as representations of the world for which
individuals have varying degrees of confidence. (See Staffel, 2013,
and the many contributions to Huber and Schmidt-Petri, 2009, and Ebert
and Smith, 2012, for further discussion. Functionalism, at least
arguably, can accommodate a number of different answers to these
questions, but the project of characterizing beliefs may not be
straightforward. </p>

<p>
In dependently of these questions, functionalists need to say
more(outright or not) about what makes a state a particular belief
(outright or not) or desire, for example, the belief &mdash; or desire
&mdash; that it will snow tomorrow. Most functional theories describe
such states as different relations (or &ldquo;attitudes&rdquo;) toward
the same state of affairs or proposition (and to describe the belief
that it will snow tomorrow and the belief that it will rain tomorrow
as the same attitude toward different propositions). This permits
differences and similarities in the contents of intentional states to
be construed as differences and similarities in the propositions to
which these states are related. But what makes a mental state a
relation to, or attitude toward, some proposition P? And can these
relations be captured solely by appeal to the functional roles of the
states in question?</p>

<p>
The development of conceptual role semantics may seem to provide an
answer to these questions: what it is for Julian to believe that P is
for Julian to be in a state that has causal and counterfactual
relations to other beliefs and desires that mirror certain
inferential, evidential, and practical (action-directed) relations
among propositions with those formal structures (Field 1980; Loar
1981; Block 1986). This proposal raises a number of important
questions. One is whether states capable of entering into such
interrelations can (must?) be construed as being, or including
elements of, a &ldquo;language of thought&rdquo; (Fodor 1975; Harman
1973; Field 1980; Loar 1981). Another is whether idiosyncracies in the
inferential or practical proclivities of different individuals make
for differences in (or incommensurabilities between) their intentional
states. (This question springs from a more general worry about the
<em>holism</em> of functional specification, which will be discussed
more generally in Section 5.1.)</p>

<p>
Yet another challenge for functionalism are the widespread intuitions
that support &ldquo;externalism&rdquo;, the thesis that what mental
states represent, or are about, cannot be characterized without appeal
to certain features of the environments in which those individuals are
embedded. Thus, if one individual's environment differs from
another's, they may count as having different intentional states, even
though they reason in the same ways, and have exactly the same
&ldquo;take&rdquo; on those environments from their own points of
view.</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;Twin Earth&rdquo; scenarios introduced by Putnam (1975) are
often invoked to support an externalist individuation of beliefs about
natural kinds such as water, gold, or tigers. Twin Earth, as Putnam
presents it, is a (hypothetical) planet on which things look, taste,
smell and feel exactly the way they do on Earth, but which have
different underlying microscopic structures; for example, the stuff
that fills the streams and comes out of the faucets, though it looks
and tastes like water, has molecular structure XYZ rather than
H<sub>2</sub>O. Many theorists find it intuitive to think that we
thereby <em>mean</em> something different by our term
&lsquo;water&rsquo; than our Twin Earth counterparts mean by theirs,
and thus that the beliefs we describe as beliefs about water are
different from those that our Twin Earth counterparts would describe
in the same way. Similar conclusions, they contend, can be drawn for
all cases of belief (and other intentional states) regarding natural
kinds.</p>

<p>
The same problem, moreover, appears to arise for other sorts of belief
as well. Tyler Burge (1979) presents cases in which it seems intuitive
that a person, Oscar, and his functionally equivalent counterpart have
different beliefs about various syndromes (such as arthritis) and
artifacts (such as sofas) because the usage of these terms by their
linguistic communities differ. For example, in Oscar's community, the
term &lsquo;arthritis&rsquo; is used as we use it, whereas in his
counterpart's community &lsquo;arthritis&rsquo; denotes inflammation
of the joints and also various maladies of the thigh. Burge's
contention is that even if Oscar and his counterpart both complain
about the &lsquo;arthritis&rsquo; in their thighs and make exactly the
same inferences involving &lsquo;arthritis&rsquo;, they mean different
things by their terms and must be regarded as having different
beliefs. If these cases are convincing, then there are differences
among types of intentional states that can only be captured by
characterizations of these states that make reference to the practices
of an individual's linguistic community. These, along with the Twin
Earth cases, suggest that if functionalist theories cannot make
reference to an individual's environment, then capturing the
representational content of (at least some) intentional states is
beyond the scope of functionalism. (See Section 4.4 for further
discussion, and Searle 1980, for related arguments against
&ldquo;computational&rdquo; theories of intentional states.)</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the externalist individuation of intentional states
may fail to capture some important psychological commonalities between
ourselves and our counterparts that are relevant to the explanation of
behavior. If my Twin Earth counterpart and I have both come in from a
long hike, declare that we're thirsty, say &ldquo;I want some
water&rdquo; and head to the kitchen, it seems that our behavior can
be explained by citing a common desire and belief. Some theorists,
therefore, have suggested that functional theories should attempt
merely to capture what has been called the &ldquo;narrow
content&rdquo; of beliefs and desires &mdash; that is, whichever
representational features individuals share with their various Twin
Earth counterparts. There is no consensus, however, about just how
functionalist theories should treat these &ldquo;narrow&rdquo;
representational features (Block 1986; Loar 1987, Yli-Vakkuti and
Hawthorne, 2018), and some philosophers have expressed skepticism
about whether such features should be construed as representations at
all (Fodor 1994; also see entry on Narrow Content). Even if a
generally acceptable account of narrow representational content can be
developed, however, if the intuitions inspired by &ldquo;Twin
Earth&rdquo; scenarios remain stable, then one must conclude that the
full representational content of intentional states cannot be captured
by &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; functional characterizations alone (and this
will be true as well for certain sorts of qualitative states, e.g.
color experiences, if they too have representational content).</p>

<h3><a name="ChaInpOutSys">4.4 Characterizing the Inputs and Outputs of a System</a></h3>

<p>
Considerations about whether certain sorts of beliefs are to be
externally individuated raise the related question about how best to
characterize the stimulations and behaviors that serve as <em>inputs
and outputs</em> to a system. Should they be construed as events
involving objects in a system's environment (such as fire trucks,
water and lemons), or rather as events in that system's sensory and
motor systems? Theories of the first type are often called
&ldquo;long-arm&rdquo; functional theories (Block 1990), since they
characterize inputs and outputs &mdash; and consequently the states
they are produced by and produce &mdash; by reaching out into the
world. Adopting a &ldquo;long-arm&rdquo; theory would prevent our Twin
Earth counterparts from sharing our beliefs and desires, and may thus
honor intuitions that support an externalist individuation of
intentional states (though further questions may remain about what
Quine has called the &ldquo;inscrutability of reference&rdquo;; see
Putnam 1988).</p>

<p>
If functional characterizations of intentional states are intended to
capture their &ldquo;narrow contents&rdquo;, however, then the inputs
and outputs of the system will have to be specified in a way that
permits individuals in different environments to be in the same
intentional state. On this view inputs and outputs may be better
characterized as activity in specific sensory receptors and motor
neurons. But this (&ldquo;short-arm&rdquo;) option also restricts the
range of individuals that can share our beliefs and desires, since
creatures with different neural structures will be prevented from
sharing our mental states, even if they share all our behavioral and
inferential dispositions. (In addition, this option would not be open
to analytic functionalist theories, since generalizations that link
mental states to neurally specified inputs and outputs would not,
presumably, have the status of conceptual truths.)</p>

<p>
Perhaps there is a way to specify sensory stimulations that abstracts
from the specifics of human neural structure enough to include any
possible creature that intuitively seems to share our mental states,
but is sufficiently concrete to rule out entities that are clearly not
cognitive systems (such as the economy of Bolivia; see Block 1980b).
If there is no such formulation, however, then functionalists will
either have to dispel intuitions to the effect that certain systems
can't have beliefs and desires, or concede that their theories may be
more &ldquo;chauvinistic&rdquo; than initially hoped.</p>

<p>
Clearly, the issues here mirror the issues regarding the individuation
of intentional states discussed in the previous section. More work is
needed to develop the &ldquo;long-arm&rdquo; and
&ldquo;short-arm&rdquo; alternatives, and to assess the merits and
deficiencies of both.</p>

<h2><a name="ObjFun">5. Objections to Functionalism</a></h2>

<p>
The previous sections were by and large devoted to the presentation of
the different varieties of functionalism and the evaluation of their
relative strengths and weaknesses. There have been many objections to
functionalism, however, that apply to all versions of the theory. Some
of these have already been introduced in earlier discussions, but
they, and many others, will be addressed in more detail here.</p>

<h3><a name="FunHol">5.1 Functionalism and Holism</a></h3>

<p>
One difficulty for every version of the theory is that functional
characterization is <em>holistic</em>. Functionalists hold that mental
states are to be characterized in terms of their roles in a
psychological theory&mdash;be it common sense, scientific, or
something in between&mdash;but all such theories incorporate
information about a large number and variety of mental states. Thus if
pain is interdefined with certain highly articulated beliefs and
desires, then animals who don't have internal states that play the
roles of our articulated beliefs and desires can't share our pains,
and humans without the capacity to feel pain can't share certain (or
perhaps any) of our beliefs and desires. In addition, differences in
the ways people reason, the ways their beliefs are fixed, or the ways
their desires affect their beliefs &mdash; due either to cultural or
individual idiosyncracies &mdash; might make it impossible for them to
share the same mental states. These are regarded as serious worries
for all versions of functionalism (see Stich 1983, Putnam 1988).</p>

<p>
Some functionalists, however (e.g. Shoemaker 1984c), have suggested
that if a creature has states that <em>approximately</em> realize our
functional theories, or realize some more specific <em>defining</em>
subset of the theory particularly relevant to the specification of
those states, then they can qualify as being mental states of the same
types as our own. The problem, of course, is to specify more precisely
what it is to be an approximate realization of a theory, or what
exactly a &ldquo;defining&rdquo; subset of a theory is intended to
include, and these are not easy questions. (They have particular bite,
moreover, for <em>analytic</em> functionalist theories, since
specifying what belongs inside and outside the &ldquo;defining&rdquo;
subset of a functional characterization raises the question of what
are the conceptually essential, and what the merely collateral,
features of a mental state, and thus raise serious questions about the
feasibility of (something like) an analytic-synthetic distinction.
(Quine 1953, Rey 1997)).</p>

<h3><a name="FunMenCau">5.2 Functionalism and Mental Causation</a></h3>

<p>
Another worry for functionalism is the &ldquo;causal exclusion
problem&rdquo;, introduced in section 3.4: the worry about whether
role functionalism can account for what we take to be the causal
efficacy of our mental states (Malcolm 1968, Kim 1989, 1998). For
example, if pain is realized in me by some neural state-type, then
insofar as there are purely physical law-like generalizations linking
states of that type with pain behavior, one can give a complete causal
explanation of my behavior by citing the occurrence of that neural
state (and the properties by virtue of which it figures in those
laws). And thus, some have argued, the higher-level role properties of
that state&mdash;its being a pain&mdash;are causally irrelevant.</p>

<p>
There have been a number of different responses to this problem. Some
(e.g. Loewer 2002, 2007, Antony and Levine 1997, Burge 1997, Baker
1997) suggest that it arises from an overly restrictive account of
causation, in which a cause must &ldquo;generate&rdquo; or
&ldquo;produce&rdquo; its effect, a view which would count the
macroscopic properties of other special sciences as causally
irrelevant as well. Instead, some argue, causation should be regarded
as a special sort of counterfactual dependence between states of
certain types (Loewer 2002, 2007, Fodor 1990, Block 1997), or as a
special sort of regularity that holds between them (Melnyk 2003). If
this is correct, then functional role properties (along with the other
macroscopic properties of the special sciences) could count as
causally efficacious (but see Ney 2012 for dissent). However, the
plausibility of these accounts of causation depends on their prospects
for distinguishing bona-fide causal relations from those that are
clearly epiphenomenal, and some have expressed skepticism about
whether they can do the job, among them Crane 1995, Kim 2007, Jackson
1995, Ludwig 1998, and McLaughlin 2006, forthcoming. (On the other
hand, see Lyons (2006) for an argument that if functional properties
are causally inefficacious, this can be viewed as a <i> benefit </i>
of the theory.)</p>

<p>
Yet other philosophers argue that causation is best regarded as a
relation between types of events that must be invoked to provide
sufficiently general explanations of behavior (Antony and Levine 1997,
Burge 1997, Baker 1997). Though many who are moved by the exclusion
problem (e.g. Kim, Jackson) maintain that there is a difference
between generalizations that are truly causal and those that
contribute in some other (merely epistemic) way to our understanding
of the world, theorists who advocate this response to the problem
charge that this objection, once again, depends on a restrictive view
of causation that would rule out too much.</p>

<p>
Another problem with views like the ones sketched above, some argue
(Kim 1989, 1998), is that mental and physical causes would thereby
<i>overdetermine</i> their effects, since each would be causally
sufficient for their production. And, though some theorists argue that
overdetermination is widespread and unproblematic (see Loewer 2002,
and also Shaffer, 2003, and Sider 2003, for a more general discussion
of overdetermination), others contend that there is a special relation
between role and realizer that provides an intuitive explanation of
how both can be causally efficacious <i>without</i> counting as
overdetermining causes. For example, Yablo (1992), suggests that
mental and physical properties stand in the relation of determinable
and determinate (just as red stands to scarlet), and argues that our
conviction that a cause should be <i>commensurate</i> with its effects
permits us to take the determinable, rather than the determinate,
property to count as causally efficacious in psychological
explanation. Bennett (2003) suggests, alternatively, that the realizer
properties <i>metaphysically necessitate</i> the role properties in a
way that prevents them from satisfying the conditions for
overdetermination. Yet another suggestion (Wilson, 1999, 2011, and
Shoemaker, 2001) is that the causal powers of mental properties are
included among (or are proper subsets of) the causal powers of the
physical properties that realize them. (See also Macdonald and
Macdonald 1995, Witmer, 2003, Yates, 2012, and Strevens, 2012, for
related views.) </p>

<p>
There has been substantial recent work on the causal exclusion
problem, which, as noted earlier, arises for any non-reductive theory
of mental states. (See the entry on Mental Causation, as well as
Bennett 2007, and Funkhouser 2007, for further discussion and
extensive bibliographies.) But it is worth discussing a related worry
about causation that arises exclusively for role-functionalism (and
other dispositional theories), namely, the problem of
&ldquo;metaphysically necessitated effects&rdquo; (Rupert 2006,
Bennett 2007). If <i>pain</i> is functionally defined (either by an a
priori <i>or</i> an empirical theory) as the state of being in some
lower-level state or other that, in certain circumstances causes
wincing, then it seems that the generalization that pain causes
wincing (in those circumstances) is at best uninformative, since the
state in question would not <i>be</i> pain if it didn't. And, on the
Humean view of causation as a contingent relation, the causal claim
would be false. Davidson (1980b) once responded to a similar argument
by noting that even if a mental state M is defined in terms of its
production of an action A, it can often be redescribed in other terms
P such that 'P caused A' is not a logical truth. But it's unclear
whether any such redescriptions are available to role (vs. realizer)
functionalists.</p>

<p>
Some theorists (e.g. Antony and Levine 1997) have responded by
suggesting that, though mental states may be defined in terms of some
of their effects, they have <i>other</i> effects that do not follow
from those definitions which can figure into causal generalizations
that are contingent, informative, and true. For example, even if it
follows from a functional definition that pain causes wincing (and
thus that the relation between pain and wincing cannot be truly
causal), psychologists may discover, say, that pain produces
resilience (or submissive behavior) in human beings. One might worry,
nonetheless, that functional definitions threaten to leave too many
commonly cited generalizations outside the realm of contingency, and
thus causal explanation: surely, we may think, we want to affirm
claims such as &ldquo;pain causes wincing&rdquo;. Such claims could be
affirmed, however, if (as seems likely) the most plausible functional
theories define sensations such as pain in terms of a small subset of
their distinctive <i>psychological</i>, rather than behavioral,
effects (see section 4.2).</p>

<p>
A different line of response to this worry (Shoemaker 1984d, 2001) is
to deny the Humean account of causation altogether, and contend that
causal relations are themselves metaphysically necessary, but this
remains a minority view. (See also Bird, 2002, and Latham, 2011, for
further discussion.)</p>

<h3><a name="FunIntBel">5.3 Functionalism and Introspective Belief</a></h3>

<p>
Another important question concerns the beliefs that we have about our
own &ldquo;occurrent&rdquo; (as opposed to dispositional) mental
states such as thoughts, sensations, and perceptions. We seem to have
immediately available, non-inferential beliefs about these states, and
the question is how this is to be explained if mental states are
identical with functional properties.</p>

<p>
The answer depends on what one takes these introspective beliefs to
involve. Broadly speaking, there are two dominant views of the matter
(but see Peacocke 1999, Ch. 5 for further alternatives). One popular
account of introspection &mdash; the &ldquo;inner sense&rdquo; model
on which introspection is taken to be a kind of &ldquo;internal
scanning&rdquo; of the contents of one's mind (Armstrong 1968) &mdash;
has been taken to be unfriendly to functionalism, on the grounds that
it's hard to see how the objects of such scanning could be
second-order relational properties of one's neural states (Goldman
1993). Some theorists, however, have maintained that functionalism can
accommodate the special features of introspective belief on the
&ldquo;inner sense&rdquo; model, since it would be only one of many
domains in which it's plausible to think that we have immediate,
non-inferential knowledge of causal or dispositional properties
(Armstrong 1993; Kobes 1993; Sterelney 1993). A full discussion of
these questions goes beyond the scope of this entry, but the articles
cited above are just three among many helpful pieces in the Open Peer
Commentary following Goldman (1993), which provides a good
introduction to the debate about this issue.</p>

<p>
Another account of introspection, identified most closely with
Shoemaker (1996a,b,c,d), is that the immediacy of introspective belief
follows from the fact that occurrent mental states and our
introspective beliefs about them are functionally interdefined. For
example, one satisfies the definition of being in pain only if one is
in a state that tends to cause (in creatures with the requisite
concepts who are considering the question) the belief that one is in
pain, and one believes that one is in pain only if one is in a state
that plays the belief role, and is caused directly by the pain itself.
On this account of introspection, the immediacy and non-inferential
nature of introspective belief is not merely compatible with
functionalism, but required by it.</p>

<p>
But there is an objection, most recently expressed by George Bealer
(1997; see also Hill 1993), that, on this model an introspective
belief can only be defined in one of two unsatisfactory ways: either
as a belief produced by a (second-order) functional state specified
(in part) by its tendency to produce that very type of belief &mdash;
which would be circular &mdash; or as a belief about the first-order
<em>realization</em> of the functional state, rather than that state
itself. Functionalists have suggested, however (Shoemaker 2001,
McCullagh 2000, Tooley 2001), that there is a way of understanding the
conditions under which beliefs can be caused by, and thus be about,
one's second-order functional states that permits mental states and
introspective beliefs about them to be non-circularly defined (but see
Bealer 2001, for a skeptical response). A full treatment of this
objection involves the more general question of whether second-order
properties can have causal efficacy, and is thus beyond the scope of
this discussion (see section 5.2 and Mental Causation entry). But even
if this objection can ultimately be deflected, it suggests that
special attention must be paid to the functional characterizations of
&ldquo;self-directed&rdquo; mental states.</p>

<h3><a name="FunNorRea">5.4 Functionalism and the Norms of Reason</a></h3>

<p>
Yet another objection to functionalist theories of any sort is that
they do not capture the interrelations that we take to be definitive
of beliefs, desires, and other intentional states. Whereas even
analytic functionalists hold that mental states&mdash; and also their
contents&mdash; are implicitly defined in terms of their (causal or
probabilistic) roles in <em>producing</em> behavior, these critics
understand intentional states to be implicitly defined in terms of
their roles in <em>rationalizing</em>, or <em>making sense of</em>,
behavior. This is a different enterprise, they claim, since
rationalization, unlike causal explanation, requires showing how an
individual's beliefs, desires, and behavior conform, or at least
approximate, to certain a priori <em>norms</em> or <em>ideals</em> of
theoretical and practical reasoning &mdash; prescriptions about which
beliefs and desires we <em>should</em> have, how we <em>should</em>
reason, or what, given our beliefs and desires, we <em>ought</em> to
do. (See Davidson 1980c, Dennett 1978, and McDowell 1985 for classic
expressions of this view.) Thus the defining
(&ldquo;constitutive&rdquo;) normative or rational relations among
intentional states expressed by these principles cannot be expected to
correspond to causal and probabilistic relations among our internal
states, sensory stimulations and behavior, since they constitute a
kind of explanation that has sources of evidence and standards for
correctness that are different from those of empirical theories
(Davidson 1980c). One can't, that is, extract facts from values.</p>

<p>
Thus, although attributions of mental states can in some sense explain
behavior by permitting an observer to &ldquo;interpret&rdquo; it as
making sense, they should not be expected to denote entities that
figure in empirical generalizations, either common sense or
scientific. (This is not to say, these theorists stress, that there
are no causes, or empirical laws of, behavior. These, however, will be
expressible only in the vocabularies of the neurosciences, or other
lower-level sciences, and not as relations among beliefs, desires and
behavior.)</p>

<p>
Functionalists have replied to these worries in different ways. Many
just deny the intuition behind the objection, and maintain that even
the strictest conceptual analyses of our intentional terms and
concepts purport to define them in terms of their bona-fide causal
roles, and that any norms they reflect are explanatory rather than
prescriptive. They argue, that is, that if these generalizations are
idealizations, they are the sort of idealizations that occur in any
scientific theory: just as Boyle's Law depicts the relations between
the temperature, pressure, and volume of a gas under certain ideal
experimental conditions, our a priori theory of the mind consists of
descriptions of what normal humans <em>would</em> do under (physically
specifiable) ideal conditions, not prescriptions as to what they
<em>should</em>, or are <em>rationally required</em>, to do.</p>

<p>
Other functionalists agree that we may advert to various norms of
inference and action in attributing beliefs and desires to others, but
deny that there is any in principle incompatibility between normative
and empirical explanations. They argue that if there are causal
relations among beliefs, desires, and behavior that even approximately
mirror the norms of rationality, then the attributions of intentional
states can be empirically confirmed (Fodor 1990; Rey 1997). In
addition, many who hold this view suggest that the principles of
rationality that intentional states must meet are quite minimal, and
comprise at most a weak set of constraints on the contours of our
theory of mind, such as that people can't, in general, hold
(obviously) contradictory beliefs, or act against their (sincerely
avowed) strongest desires (Loar 1981). Still others suggest that the
intuition that we attribute beliefs and desires to others according to
rational norms is based on a fundamental mistake; these states are
attributed not on the basis of whether they rationalize the behavior
in question, but whether those subjects can be seen as using
principles of inference and action sufficiently like our own &mdash;
be they rational, like Modus Ponens, or irrational, like the Gambler's
Fallacy or the now familiar instances of &ldquo;predictable
irrationality&rdquo; documented in Kahneman, 2011. (See Stich 1981,
and Levin 1988, for discussion of this question, and for a more
general debate about the compatibility of normative and psychological
principles, see Rey, 2007, and Wedgwood, 2007. See also Gl&uuml;er and
Wikforss, 2009, 2013, and for further discussion, the entry, The
Normativity of Meaning and Content.)</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, although many functionalists argue that the
considerations discussed above show that there is no in principle bar
to a functionalist theory that has empirical force, these worries
about the normativity of intentional ascription continue to fuel
skepticism about functionalism (and, for that matter, any scientific
theory of the mind that uses intentional notions).</p>

<p>
In addition to these general worries about functionalism, there are
particular questions that arise for functional characterizations of
experiential or phenomenal states. These questions will be discussed
in the following section.</p>

<h3><a name="FunProQua">5.5 Functionalism and the Problem of Qualia</a></h3>

<p>
Functionalist theories of all varieties &mdash; whether analytic or
empirical, FSIT or functional specification &mdash; attempt to
characterize mental states exclusively in relational, specifically
causal, terms. A common and persistent objection, however, is that no
such characterizations can capture the phenomenal character, or
&ldquo;qualia&rdquo;, of experiential states such as perceptions,
emotions, and bodily sensations, since they would leave out certain
essential properties of those experiential states, namely, &ldquo;what
it's like&rdquo; (Nagel 1974) to have them. The next three sections
will present the most serious worries about the ability of
functionalist theories to give an adequate characterization of these
states. (These worries, of course, will extend to intentional states,
if, as some philosophers argue, &ldquo;what it's like&rdquo; to have
them is among their essential properties as well. (See Searle 1992, G.
Strawson, 1986, Horgan and Tienson, 2002, Kriegel 2003, Pitt 2008, for
early presentations of this view, and see Bayne and Montague, 2011,
and Smithies, 2013a and 2013b for more general discussions of whether
intentional states possess phenomenal character&mdash; often called
&ldquo;cognitive phenomenology&rdquo;&mdash; and if so, what, more
precisely, it is.)</p>

<h4><a name="InvAbsQua">5.5.1 Inverted and Absent Qualia</a></h4>

<p>
The first to be considered are the &ldquo;absent&rdquo; and
&ldquo;inverted&rdquo; qualia objections most closely associated with
Ned Block (1980b; see also Block and Fodor 1972). The &ldquo;inverted
qualia&rdquo; objection to functionalism maintains that there could be
an individual who (for example) is in a state that satisfies the
functional definition of our experience of red, but is experiencing
green instead&mdash;and similarly for all the colors in the spectrum.
It is a descendant of the claim, discussed by philosophers from Locke
to Wittgenstein, that there could be an individual with an
&ldquo;inverted spectrum&rdquo; who is behaviorally indistinguishable
from someone with normal color vision; both objections trade on the
contention that the purely relational characterizations in question
cannot make distinctions among distinct experiences with isomorphic
causal patterns. (Nida-R&uuml;melin, 1996, argues that the science of
color vision leaves open the possibility that there could be
functionally equivalent red-green &ldquo;inverts&rdquo;, but even if
inverted qualia are not really an empirical possibility for human
beings, given certain asymmetries in our &ldquo;quality space&rdquo;
for color, and differences in the relations of color experiences to
other mental states such as emotions (Hardin 1988), it seems possible
that there are creatures with perfectly symmetrical color quality
spaces for whom a purely functional characterization of color
experience would fail.)</p>

<p>
A related objection, the &ldquo;absent qualia&rdquo; objection,
maintains that there could be creatures functionally equivalent to
normal humans whose mental states have no qualitative character at
all. In his well-known &ldquo;Chinese nation&rdquo;
thought-experiment, Block (1980b) invites us to imagine that the
population of China (chosen because its size approximates the number
of neurons in a typical human brain) is recruited to duplicate his
functional organization for a period of time, receiving the equivalent
of sensory input from an artificial body and passing messages back and
forth via satellite. Block argues that such a
&ldquo;homunculi-headed&rdquo; system &mdash; or
&ldquo;Blockhead&rdquo;, as it has come to be called &mdash; would not
have mental states with any qualitative character (other than the
qualia possessed by the individuals themselves), and thus that there
could be states functionally equivalent to sensations or perceptions
that lack their characteristic &ldquo;feels&rdquo;. Conversely, some
argue that functional role is not <em>necessary</em> for qualitative
character: for example, it seems that one could have mild, but
distinctive, twinges that have no typical causes or characteristic
effects.</p>

<p>
All these objections purport to have characterized a creature with the
functional organization of normal human beings, but without any, or
the right sort, of qualia (or vice versa), and thus to have produced a
counterexample to functional theories of experiential states. One line
of response, initially advanced by Sydney Shoemaker (1994b), is that
although functional duplicates of ourselves with inverted qualia may
be possible, duplicates with absent qualia are not, since their
possibility leads to untenable skepticism about the qualitative
character of one's own mental states. This argument has been
challenged, however (Block 1980b; but see Shoemaker's response in
1994d, and Balog, 1999, for a related view), and the more common
response to these objections&mdash;particularly to the absent qualia
objection&mdash; is to question whether scenarios involving creatures
such as Blockheads provide genuine counterexamples to functionalist
theories of experiential states. </p>

<p>
For example, some theorists (Dennett 1978; Levin 1985; Van Gulick
1989) argue that these scenarios provide clear-cut counterexamples
only to <em>crude</em> functional theories, and that attention to the
subtleties of more sophisticated characterizations will undermine the
intuition that functional duplicates of ourselves with absent qualia
are possible (or, conversely, that there are qualitative states
without distinctive functional roles). The plausibility of this line
of defense is often questioned, however, since there is tension
between the goal of increasing the sophistication (and thus the
individuative powers) of the functional definitions, and the goal (for
analytic functionalists) of keeping these definitions within the
bounds of the a priori (though see Section 4.2), or (for
psycho-functionalists) broad enough to be instantiable by creatures
other than human beings. A related suggestion is that absent qualia
seem possible only because of our imaginative shortcomings, in
particular, that it is hard for us to attend, at any one time, to all
the relevant features of even the simplest functional characterization
of experiential states; another is that the intuition that Blockheads
lack qualia is based on prejudice&mdash;against creatures with
unfamiliar shapes and extended reaction times (Dennett 1978), or
creatures with parts widely distributed in space (Lycan, 1981,
Schwitzgebel 2015 and commentary).</p>

<p>
There are other responses to analogous absent qualia arguments that
are prominent in the literature, but the target of those arguments is
broader. Block's argument was initially presented as a challenge
exclusively to functionalist theories, both analytic and empirical,
and not generally to physicalistic theories of experiential states;
the main concern was that the purely relational resources of
functional description were incapable of capturing the intrinsic
qualitative character of states such as feeling pain, or seeing red.
(Indeed, in Block's 1980b, p. 291, he suggests that qualitative states
may best be construed as &ldquo;composite state[s] whose components
are a <em>quale</em> and a [functional state],&rdquo; and adds, in an
endnote (note 22) that the <em>quale</em> &ldquo;might be identified
with a physico-chemical state&rdquo;.) But there are similar
objections that have been raised against all physicalistic theories of
experiential states that are important to consider in evaluating the
prospects for functionalism. These will be discussed in the next two
sections.</p>

<h4><a name="FunZomExpGap">5.5.2 Functionalism, Zombies, and the &ldquo;Explanatory Gap&rdquo;</a></h4>

<p>
One important objection, advanced by (among others) Kripke (1972) and
Chalmers (1996a), derives from Descartes's well-known argument in the
<em>Sixth Meditation</em> (1641) that since he can clearly and
distinctly conceive of himself existing apart from his body (and vice
versa), and since the ability to clearly and distinctly conceive of
things as existing apart guarantees that they are in fact distinct, he
is in fact distinct from his body.</p>

<p>
Chalmers's version of the argument (1996a, 2002), known as the
&ldquo;Zombie Argument&rdquo;, has been particularly influential. The
first premise of this argument is that it is <em>conceivable</em>, in
a special, robust, &ldquo;positive&rdquo; sense, that there are
molecule-for-molecule duplicates of oneself with no qualia (call them
&ldquo;zombies&rdquo;, following Chalmers 1996a). The second premise
is that scenarios that are &ldquo;positively&rdquo; conceivable in
this way represent real, metaphysical, possibilities. Thus, he
concludes, zombies are possible, and functionalism &mdash; or, more
broadly, physicalism &mdash; is false. The force of the Zombie
Argument is due in large part to the way Chalmers defends its two
premises; he provides a detailed account of just what is required for
zombies to be conceivable, and also an argument as to why the
conceivability of zombies entails their possibility (see also Chalmers
2002, 2006, 2010, Ch. 6, and Chalmers and Jackson 2002). This account,
based on a more comprehensive theory of how we can evaluate claims
about possibility and necessity known as &ldquo;two-dimensional
semantics&rdquo;, reflects an increasingly popular way of thinking
about these matters, but remains controversial. (For alternative ways
of explaining conceivability, see Kripke (1986), Hart (1988); for
criticism of the argument from two-dimensional semantics, see Yablo
2000, 2002, Bealer 2002, Stalnaker 2002, Soames 2004, Byrne and Prior
2006; but see also Chalmers 2006.)</p>

<p>
In a related challenge, Joseph Levine (1983, 1993, 2001) argues that,
even if the conceivability of zombies doesn't entail that
functionalism (or more broadly, physicalism) is false, it opens an
&ldquo;explanatory gap&rdquo; not encountered in other cases of
inter-theoretical reduction, since the qualitative character of an
experience cannot be deduced from any physical or functional
description of it. Such attempts thus pose, at very least, a unique
epistemological problem for functionalist (or physicalist) reductions
of qualitative states.</p>

<p>
In response to these objections, analytic functionalists contend, as
they did with the inverted and absent qualia objections, that
sufficient attention to what is required for a creature to duplicate
our functional organization would reveal that zombies are not really
conceivable, and thus there is no threat to functionalism and no
explanatory gap. A related suggestion is that, while zombies may
<em>now</em> seem conceivable, we will eventually find them
inconceivable, given the growth of empirical knowledge, just as we now
find it inconceivable that there could be H2O without water (Yablo
1999). Alternatively, some suggest that the inconceivability of
zombies awaits the development of new <i>concepts</i> that can provide
a link between our current phenomenal and physical concepts (Nagel
1975, 2000), while others (McGinn 1989) agree, but deny that humans
are capable of forming such concepts. </p>

<p>
None of these responses, however, would be an effective defense of
Psychofunctionalism, which does not attempt to provide analyses of
experiential concepts (or suggest that there would, or could, be any
to come). But there is an increasingly popular strategy for defending
physicalism against these objections that could be used to defend
Psychofunctionalism, namely, to concede that there can be no
conceptual analyses of qualitative concepts (such as <em>what it's
like to see red</em> or <em>what it's like to feel pain)</em> in
purely functional terms, and focus instead on developing arguments to
show that the conceivability of zombies neither implies that such
creatures are possible nor opens up an explanatory gap.</p>

<p>
One line of argument (Block and Stalnaker 1999; Yablo 2000) contends
that the conceivability of (alleged) counterexamples to
psycho-physical or psycho-functional identity statements, such as
zombies, has analogues in other cases of successful inter-theoretical
reduction, in which the lack of conceptual analyses of the terms to be
reduced makes it conceivable, though not possible, that the identities
are false. However, the argument continues, if these cases routinely
occur in what are generally regarded as successful reductions in the
sciences, then it's reasonable to conclude that the conceivability of
a situation does not entail its possibility.</p>

<p>
A different line of argument (Horgan 1994; Loar 1990; Lycan 1990; Hill
1997, Hill and McLaughlin 1999, Balog 1999) maintains that, while
generally the conceivability of a scenario entails its possibility,
scenarios involving zombies stand as important exceptions. The
difference is that the phenomenal, or &ldquo;what it's like&rdquo;,
concepts used to describe the properties of experience that we
conceive zombies to lack are significantly different from the
third-personal, discursive concepts of our common sense and scientific
theories such as <em>mass, force</em> or <em>charge</em>; they
comprise a special class of non-discursive, first-personal,
perspectival representations of those properties. Whereas conceptually
independent third-personal concepts <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> may
reasonably be taken to express metaphysically independent properties,
or modes of presentation, no such metaphysical conclusions can be
drawn when one of the concepts in question is third-personal and the
other is <em>phenomenal</em>, since these concepts may merely be
picking out the same properties in different ways. Thus, the
conceivability of zombies, dependent as it is on our use of phenomenal
concepts, provides no evidence of their metaphysical possibility.</p>

<p>
Key to this line of defense is the claim that these special phenomenal
concepts can denote functional (or physical) properties without
expressing some irreducibly qualitative modes of presentation of them,
for otherwise it couldn't be held that these concepts do in fact apply
to our functional (or physical) duplicates, even though it's
conceivable that they don't. This, not surprisingly, has been
disputed, and there is currently much discussion in the literature
about the plausibility of this claim. If this line of defense is
successful, however, it can also provide a response to the
&ldquo;Distinct Property Argument&rdquo;, discussed in section 3.3.
(See Chalmers 1999, Holman, 2013 for criticism of this view, but see
the responses of Loar 1999, and Hill and McLaughlin 1999, Balog, 2012,
Levin, 2008, forthcoming, Diaz-Leon, 2010, 2014; see also see Levin
2002, 2008, and Shroer, 2010, for the presentation, if not
endorsement, of a hybrid view.) </p>

<h4><a name="FunKnoArg">5.5.3 Functionalism and the Knowledge Argument</a></h4>

<p>
In another important, related, challenge to functionalism (and, more
generally, physicalism), Thomas Nagel (1974) and Frank Jackson (1982)
argue that a person could know all the physical and functional facts
about a certain type of experience and still not &ldquo;know what it's
like&rdquo; to have it. This is known as the &ldquo;Knowledge
Argument&rdquo;, and its conclusion is that there are certain
properties of experiences &mdash; the &ldquo;what it's like&rdquo; to
see red, feel pain, or sense the world through echolocation &mdash;
which cannot be identified with functional (or physical) properties.
Though neither Nagel (2000) nor Jackson (1998) now endorse this
argument, many philosophers contend that it raises special problems
for any physicalistic view (see Alter 2007, and, in response, Jackson
2007).</p>

<p>
An early line of defense against these arguments, endorsed primarily
but not exclusively by a priori functionalists, is known as the
&ldquo;Ability Hypothesis&rdquo;. (Nemirow 1990, 2007, Lewis 1990,
Levin 1986). &ldquo;Ability&rdquo; theorists suggest that knowing what
it's like to see red or feel pain is merely a sort of
<em>practical</em> knowledge, a &ldquo;knowing how&rdquo; (to imagine,
remember, or re-identify, a certain type of experience) rather than a
knowledge of propositions or facts. (See Tye 2000, for a summary of
the pros and cons of this position; for further discussion, see the
essays in Ludlow, Nagasawa, and Stoljar 2004.) An alternative view
among contemporary functionalists is that coming to know what it's
like to see red or feel pain is indeed to acquire propositional
knowledge uniquely afforded by experience, expressed in terms of
first-personal concepts of those experiences. But, the argument
continues, this provides no problem for functionalism (or
physicalism), since these special first-personal concepts need not
denote, or introduce as &ldquo;modes of presentation&rdquo;, any
irreducibly qualitative properties. This view, of course, shares the
strengths and weaknesses of the analogous response to the
conceivability arguments discussed above. If it is plausible, however,
it can also challenge the argument of some philosophers (e.g.,
Chalmers, 2002, Stoljar, 2001, and Alter, 2016) that maintains that no
physicalistic theory, not even fundamental physics, can provide
anything but a relational characterization of the items in their
domains&mdash;their structure and dynamics&mdash;and concludes that no
physicalistic theory can capture what seems, from the inside, to be
the intrinsic, non-relational properties of our experiential states.
(See the essays in Alter and Nagasawa, 2015, Part III, for further
discussion.) </p>

<p>
There is one final strategy for defending a functionalist account of
qualitative states against all of these objections, namely,
eliminativism (Dennett 1988; Rey 1997, Frankish, 2016). One can, that
is, deny that there are any such things as irreducible
<em>qualia</em>, and maintain that the conviction that such things do,
or perhaps even <em>could</em>, exist is due to illusion &mdash; or
confusion.</p>

<h2><a name="FutFun">6. The Future of Functionalism</a></h2>

<p>
In the last part of the 20th century, functionalism stood as the
dominant theory of mental states. Like behaviorism, functionalism
takes mental states out of the realm of the &ldquo;private&rdquo; or
subjective, and gives them status as entities open to scientific
investigation. But, in contrast to behaviorism, functionalism's
characterization of mental states in terms of their roles in the
production of behavior grants them the causal efficacy that common
sense takes them to have. And in permitting mental states to be
multiply realized, functionalism seems to offer an account of mental
states that is compatible with materialism, without limiting the class
of those with minds to creatures with brains like ours.</p>

<p>
More recently, however, there has been a resurgence of interest in the
psycho-physical (type-) identity thesis, fueled in part by the
contention that, in the actual practice of neuroscience, neural states
are type-individuated more coarsely than early identity theorists such
as Place, Feigl, and Smart assumed. If this is so, then it may well be
that creatures that differ from us in their fine-grain
neurophysiological make-up can nonetheless share our neural states,
and thus that the psycho-physical identity thesis can claim some of
the scope once thought to be exclusive to functionalism. The
plausibility of this thesis depends, first, on whether or not such
creatures would in fact be our functional equivalents, and if so,
whether or not their underlying similarities would in fact be
(coarse-grain) <i>neural</i> similarities, and not (finer-grain)
psycho-functional similarities. (See Bechtel 2012, Bickle 2012,
McCauley 2012, and Shapiro and Polger 2012, Polger and Shapiro, 2016,
Aizawa and Gillett, forthcoming,and the essays in DeJoong and Shouten
2012, for further discussion; see also the entry on Multiple
Realizability.) Even so, it seems that there could be creatures, both
biological and non-biological, that are functionally equivalent to us
but do not possess even our coarse-grain neural properties. If so, and
if these creatures can plausibly be regarded as sharing our mental
states&mdash;to be sure, a controversial thesis&mdash;then even if
neural states can be individuated more coarsely, functionalism will
retain its claim to greater universality than the identity thesis.
</p>

<p>
There remain other substantial questions about functionalism. Most
discussions of the prospects for functionalism focus on its adequacy
as an account of familiar experiential states such as sensational and
perceptual experiences, and familiar intentional states such as
beliefs and desires. But although some philosophers have considered
whether there can be adequate functionalist characterizations of
emotions and moods (e.g. Rey, 1990, Nussbaum, 2003, deHoog, et al,
2011) there is increasing interest in these questions, and more work
needs to be done. In addition, there is increasing interest in
determining whether there can be plausible functional
characterizations of non-standard perceptual experiences, such as
synaesthesia, and various sorts of altered states of consciousness
that can arise from the ingestion of drugs or from focused meditation.
(See Gray et al. 2002, 2004, and Deroy, 2017, for discussions of
synaesthesia. For general discussions of altered states of
consciousness, see Velmans and Schneider, eds. (2007), and Thompson,
(2015).</p>

<p>
Yet another question is whether functional theories can accommodate
non-standard views about the location of mental states, such as the
hypothesis of extended cognition, which maintains that certain mental
states such as memories&mdash;and not just their representational
contents&mdash;can reside outside the head. This question has
implications not only for the viability of a functionalist
characterization of memory, but also of beliefs, emotions, and moods.
(See Clark and Chalmers 2002, Clark, 2008, Adams and Aizawa 2008,
Rupert 2009, Sprevack 2009, and the essays in Menary, 2010, for
further discussion.)</p>

<p>
In general, the sophistication of functionalist theories has increased
since their introduction, but so has the sophistication of the
objections to functionalism, especially to functionalist accounts of
mental causation (section 5.2), introspective knowledge (Section 5.3),
and the qualitative character of experiential states (Section 5.5).
For those unconvinced of the plausibility of dualism, however, and
unwilling to restrict mental states to creatures physically like
ourselves, the initial attractions of functionalism remain. The
primary challenge for future functionalists, therefore, will be to
meet these objections to the doctrine, either by articulating a
functionalist theory in increasingly convincing detail, or by showing
how the intuitions that fuel these objections can be explained
away.</p>

<h1>Open Letter to General Readers</h1>

<p>
Dear Reader,</p>

<p>
  As a reader of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP), you
are interested in high-quality discussions of values, politics, ideas,
science, and religion/faith, all of which concern the human condition.
The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) offers entries on such
topics as democracy, voluntary-euthanasia, affirmative action, animal
consciousness, civil rights, and many other topics fundamental to our
place in the world. Because you are familiar with the SEP we know that
you are the kind of individual who values access to academically
rigorous information on the world wide web.  Yet, many times when you
track down promising leads in academic journals or reference works,
you find yourself at a publisher's website being asked to pay $30 or
more to download a single article, or to pay hundreds of dollars a
year for an individual subscription.</p>

<p>
 The SEP has so far managed to avoid charging such fees and
subscriptions because of generous public funding from the National
Endowment for the Humanities and the National Science Foundation.  But
we cannot rely on public largesse forever, so in conjunction with
research librarians worldwide, we have developed an alternative plan
to continue serving our highly-regarded encyclopedia entries without
instituting subscriptions or per-item charges.</p>

<p>
 The SEP is thus entering a crucial fundraising phase and needs your
help to secure its future.  In order to stay free and preserve open
access to the SEP we are establishing a permanent operating fund.
This fund will be used to cover the annual costs of administering and
supporting the volunteer efforts of over 950 professional philosophers
who donate their time and labor to collaboratively write, referee, and
maintain the encyclopedia.</p>

<p>
 Our April 2002 survey indicates that a majority of SEP readers are
not professional philosophers.  Thus, our authors and editors are not
just volunteering their labor for the benefit of the profession, but
also for the benefit for the public at large and professionals in
non-philosophy disciplines.  We are therefore asking everyone to play
their part in preserving open access to the unique resource that is
the SEP.  In addition to our fundraising efforts through the libraries
and academic institutions, we need readers like you to make a one-time
donation to help us reach our fundraising goal.</p>

<p>
 Together we can build an permanent operating fund for the SEP and
ensure that you will never be faced with a bill for reading philosophy
reference articles of the highest quality.  Below we have included
more details of our plan, but if you are already convinced, please
jump straight to the section on
 <a href="#What">what you can do</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#Open">Our Plan to Preserve Free and Open Access</a></li>
<li><a href="#Value">Our Value to the Public</a></li>
<li><a href="#What">What You Can Do</a></li>
</ul>



<h2><a id="Open">Our Plan to Preserve Free and Open Access</a></h2>

<p>
  Open access is important in part because information should be free
and members of the public should be able to access high-quality
academic scholarship on topics of importance.  In addition, open
access is crucial to the success of the SEP.  By being free, numerous
members of the general public can read the SEP and create links to it
on their own web pages.  This in turn leads to our high page rank in
Google and other search engines.  And that means that SEP entries on
topics of importance to the general public will have high visibility
on the web.</p>

<p>
 To illustrate with a concrete example, the author of the SEP entry on
 <a href="../entries/holes/index.html" target="other">holes</a>,
 Professor Achille Varzi (Philosophy, Columbia University), was
interviewed on CNN because the definition of &lsquo;hole&rsquo; played
a crucial role in the vote count in Florida during the 2000
presidential election. (Does a hole in a ballot have to be more like a
hole in a colander, which goes all the way through the surface, or can
it be more like a pothole or a hole in the ground, which only deforms
the surface?) The CNN reporter sought an expert, and might have
identified Varzi as such by querying Google &mdash; the SEP entry on
holes comes up as the first web page that addresses the general
concept of holes (as opposed to the movie "Holes" or black
holes). During the 2002-2003 academic year, 1.1 million accesses to
the SEP were the result of a Google search.</p>

<p>
 Most publications attempting to maintain the highest of academic
standards cost money and require subscriptions.  The costs of print
and web publications are overwhelming academic libraries, and though
this is primarily due to content pricing by commercial publishers for
scientific publications, there are also significant costs both for
content from academic/non-profit publishers and for material in the
humanities. There are few models for keeping web publications free and
accessible to everyone.</p>

<p>
  The SEP has operated on federal grant money since 1998.  But this
forces us to apply for new grants every 2 years, and it is by no means
certain that we will continue to be awarded such grants.  The
long-term funding plan we have developed is a new model for funding a
humanities publication.  It involves a partnership between Stanford
University and large library organizations, to raise an endowment for
the SEP.  (Though endowment models are not new, the kinds of
institutional arrangements we've developed between Stanford and the
library organizations for the long-term support of the SEP are new and
distinctive.) While the library organizations try to raise $3 million
from libraries at institutions with philosophy departments, we here at
Stanford will try to raise just over $1 million from private
sources.</p>


<h2><a id="Value">Our Value to the Public</a></h2>

<p>
 The SEP brings philosophy to a wider audience than just those in
academia. 25% of readers in an April 2002 survey identified themselves
as neither students, instructors, nor researchers. In the light of the
fact that many SEP entries are being downloaded tens of thousands of
times each year, our reference work is finding a significant public
readership. (The entry on Nietzsche was downloaded 164,000 times in
the 2002-2003 academic year and the entry on voluntary euthanasia was
downloaded 61,500 times during that same period.) To our knowledge, no
other refereed and scholarly resource in philosophy has this kind of
readership, and so the SEP may be philosophy's most visible public
face.</p>

<p>
 Our general readership also includes many people involved in
education as students, teachers, and parents.  52% of our survey
respondents were students (of all levels) and another 14% identified
themselves as instructors.  These numbers indicate that both sides of
the learning relationship between teachers and students are being
served by the SEP. We found it interesting that 10% of the students
who responded to our survey indicated that they were high-school
students.</p>

<p>
 The SEP's value to the public can also judged by the fact that it
promotes public appreciation of a wide range of topics in the
humanities. The SEP contains articles that are relevant to many
different disciplines in the humanities: entries in aesthetics are
relevant to art history; entries on ancient philosophy are relevant to
the classics; entries on post-modern philosophy are relevant to
literary criticism; entries on ethics to the humanities in general;
biographical entries on prominent philosophers relate to the history
of ideas and cultural studies; entries in philosophy of language are
relevant to linguistics; etc.  The SEP is not just for philosophers;
anyone interested in a humanist perspective will find the SEP
valuable.</p>

<p>
 Here are comments made by a few of the readers who responded to our
survey:</p>

<ul>
 <li>I am not a professional philosopher, although for many years I have
had a serious interest in several philosophical problems relating
mainly to truth, meaning, semantics, etc.  Many of the Stanford
encyclopedia articles provide excellent, current overviews of topics
related to my studies.  I am unaware of any other readily available
scholarly web resource in philosophy that offers the breadth and depth
of the encyclopedia.  It would be a major loss if this project were
not continued more or less in its current form.  You deserve much
thanks from all serious students.  </li>

<li>
 I am particularly interested in the mind/body problem. It is
something of a hobby of mine. I read articles from the encyclopedia
for my personal enjoyment.</li>

<li>
 I am a high school librarian and I often use this encyclopedia as an
example of a good website when I am teaching students how to evaluate
websites.  I also recommend it to the students in the AP English
class.  </li>

</ul>

<h2><a id="What">What You Can Do</a></h2>

<p>Here are steps you can take to help us to meet our fundraising goals:</p>

<ol>

<li>Please consider
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/support/donate.html">making a generous donation</a>
  to the SEP.  [Note: Your gift will be processed by the Stanford
University Office of Development but <em>put into a special account
that is reserved for the exclusive use of the Stanford Encyclopedia
ofPhilosophy</em>.]
  All donations are fully tax-deductible.</li>

<li>Talk up the SEP with friends, family, and colleagues who might
find it useful and interesting and might thereby be motivated to
support us as well.</li>

<li>Encourage your local library or library system to support us.
Tell the librarians that you value the Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy as a free resource.</li>

</ol>

<p>
 It will be an outstanding and enduring legacy of those who contribute
to the SEP to help in providing people around the world with a free
resource by which they could satisfy their intellectual curiosity from
an authoritative source on philosophical questions of all kinds and,
in particular, those concerning the human condition.</p>

<p>
 Thanks very much for your efforts in support of the SEP.  We
anticipate a successful fund-raising drive. </p>

<p>
Yours,</p>

<h1>Open Letter to Librarians</h1>

<p>
 Dear Librarian,</p>

<p>
 In this letter, we'd like to lay out for you the various
elements of our funding plan, indicate the endorsements it
has received, and offer some reasons why we think you should
lend your support to the SEP.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#plan">Our Funding Plan</a></li>
  <li><a href="#endorse">Endorsements</a></li>
  <li><a href="#reasons">Reasons to Contribute</a></li>
  <li><a href="#how">How to Contribute</a></li>
</ul>

<p>

We have also prepared a special document focusing on the question,
 &ldquo;<a href="why-support.html">Why should libraries at small colleges or public universities support the SEP?</a>&rdquo; </p>

<!-- <hr /> -->

<h2><a id="plan">Our Funding Plan</a></h2>

<p>
  Stanford University has partnered with the International Coalition
of Library Consortia (ICOLC) and the Scholarly Publishing and Academic
Resources Coalition (SPARC) to implement a new model for ensuring
long-term open access to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
(SEP).  This model was developed by a committee of representatives
from Stanford, ICOLC, and SPARC, and our model was endorsed by the
National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) with a $500,000 matching
grant. The main elements of our new model are: </p>

 <ul>
 <li>Stanford and its library partners ICOLC and SPARC are working
together to raise a $4.125 million endowment for the SEP. Though
Stanford has met its goal of raising $1.125 million from private
(individual and corporate) donors, while ICOLC and SPARC are trying
to raise $3 million from the world-wide library community, focusing on
those libraries at institutions that offer a degree in
Philosophy.</li>
 <li>Library support for the SEP will come in the form of membership
dues paid to the membership organization called the 
 <a href="https://libraries.indiana.edu/sepia" target="other"><em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy International Association</em> (SEPIA)</a>.  Fiscal services for 
SEPIA will be provided by the 
  <a href="https://www.pdcnet.org/wp/about/aboutus/" target="other">Philosophy Documentation Center</a> (PDC),
which will invoice the libraries for, and then collect, the membership dues. After 
assessing a small processing fee for its fiscal services on the dues collected, the
PDC turns over the membership dues to Stanford, subject to the
conditions:<p></p>
   <ul>
   <li>Stanford will use the money it receives from the PDC only
for the support of the SEP,</li>
   <li>Should the SEP project ever terminate, Stanford will return the 
money received from the PDC, together with any unspent interest
and appreciation, to the libraries that paid the money.</li>
   <li>Should the SEP project ever move to a new institution, the
money received from the PDC will go with the project.</li>
   </ul>
   <p></p>
   </li>
 
 <li>Contributing libraries will also get additional incentives:<p></p>
   <ul>
   <li>The SEP web pages sent to their readers will be stamped with
a customized banner which acknowledges the support of the local library.</li>
   <li>The SEP quarterly archives will be made available as a
single compressed file, which can be stored and preserved, thereby building
the library's collection.  The right to serve the SEP archives vests  only if
the SEP project terminates.</li>
   <li>SEPIA members will be listed on a special webpage as supporters
of the SEP.  
   </ul>
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
 The following table indicates the recommended contribution level for
institutions in the U.S. and Canada which offer degrees in
Philosophy:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <table border="1">
   <tr>
    <td></td>
     <td><strong>Three Annual Payments of</strong></td>
     </tr>
     
   <tr>
   <td>Philosophy Ph.D. granting institutions</td>
   <td style="text-align: center;">$5250</td>
   </tr>
   
   <tr>
   <td>Philosophy M.A. granting institutions</td>
   <td style="text-align: center;">$2100</td>
   </tr>  
     
   <tr>
   <td>Philosophy B.A. granting institutions</td>
    <td style="text-align: center;">$1050</td>
   </tr>
   </table>
   </blockquote>
   
<p>
 For institutions outside the U.S. and Canada, the ICOLC plan calls
for contributions that are appropriately calibrated to local economic
conditions.  You can find the recommended membership dues for 
institutions outside the U.S. and Canada on the following
 <a href="SEPIA-dues-schedule.html" target="other">SEPIA Dues Schedule</a>.</p>

<p>

Those who are curious about why we are not following a more
traditional funding model are welcome to read the document
 <a href="problems.html">The Problem With a Traditional Funding Model</a>, 
which explains the problem we would face.
</p>

<h2><a id="endorse">Endorsements</a></h2>

<p>
 The NEH has endorsed this plan by offering our library partners a Challenge
Grant.  The NEH has contributed $500,000.  See the following letter from
the Director of the NEH in 2004:</p>

<blockquote>
  <a href="neh.html" target="other">Letter from Bruce Cole</a>,
Director, National Endowment for the Humanities
</blockquote>

<p>
 which explains how the SEP's funding model went through a rigorous
referee process at the NEH. </p>
 
<p>
Tom Sanville, the Executive Director of OhioLINK and the meetings organizer of the
ICOLC wrote:</p>

 <blockquote>
  <a href="ICOLC-Call.pdf" target="other">A Call for ICOLC Initiated Global Community Action</a> (283K PDF document)
 </blockquote>

<p>
which outlines many reasons for library participation in our funding
plan.</p>


<p> 
Finally, many institutions have endorsed our plan directly by their
participation.  The following institutions have already registered
their commitment:</p>
  
<blockquote>
 <a href="commitments.html">List of Libraries and Other Institutions Which Have Registered Their Support</a>
</blockquote>
 
<p>
Since the reasons for library participation in our fund-raising plan
are scattered throughout the documents linked in above, we have
extracted them and put them into the next section.</p>

<h2><a id="reasons">Reasons for Library Participation</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li>The SEP has become a "must-have" resource, given how widely its
entries are read by students and faculty, and how widely its entries
are used in course syllabi at major academic institutions.  Even for
libraries at smaller academic institutions and public libraries, it is
the kind of publication that you would like to have but wouldn't be
able to afford if it goes behind a subscription wall.
  <li>The SEP has developed a "one-time cost" plan (spread over 3
years), rather than an ongoing payment model.  This saves the library
money.  The suggested contribution for your library depends on which
degree in philosophy that it offers and where it is located in the
world. The details are spelled out in the ICOLC Call to Action.
However, even libraries at institutions without philosophy departments
should consider contributing, since you will have constituents who are
using the SEP (see item 4 below).  </li>
  <li>The money that libraries contribute to the SEP will be
<em>protected</em>.  In particular, should the SEP project ever
terminate, the money libraries contribute (minus the processing fee)
will be returned together with any unspent interest and appreciation.
The contracts which implement this arrangement have been vetted by the
NEH, PDC, and the Stanford Director of Planned Giving, and they have
been approved by the Stanford Provost and Dean of Research.  By 
contrast, commercial and academic publishers never offer to return
money used to obtain access to a publication. </li>
   <li>There are students and scholars in other departments at your
institution who are using the SEP, and so this is not just a resource
for philosophers. (Send us email and we can send you a total number of
accesses from your campus during recent academic years.) We hope you
will agree that funds for the SEP therefore need not
come <em>only</em> from the funds reserved for your philosophy
collection purchases. </li>
   <li>For libraries that contribute to our funding plan, we will
facilitate a simple download of our quarterly archives.  (We make
quarterly archives so as to have a stable method of citing the content
of entries.  The dynamic portion of the SEP is always changing, and we
don't want users to cite the active versions of the entries.  So the
quarterly archives hold fixed versions of each entry; the material in
them will not change.)  Full members of SEPIA will be able to
download our archives as a single compressed file. By downloading and
storing our quarterly archives, you will not simply be licensing the
right to examine the material, but you will be building you collection
and thereby playing an important role in archiving scholarly
material. (Note: the right to actually serve the archives to your
constituents will vest only if the SEP project should ever
terminate.)</li>
 <li>The SEP will &lsquo;brand&rsquo; pages delivered to contributing
institutions.  Once an institution has registered and paid membership
dues to SEPIA, our servers will connect IP addresses from their
institution with the institution's domain name, and will 
deliver a customized  "thank you
banner".</li>
   <li>Contributing libraries get to play a role in keeping the SEP
free for everyone &mdash; becoming part of the solution to the
free-rider problem.</li>
   <li>Library contributions will play a role in helping to eliminate
the collections crisis that has been created by the high pricing
structure of many commercial publishers. Indeed, the SEP has been
approached by several big name publishers eager to form a partnership,
and if its funding plan is not successful, may find that it must
contemplate such a partnership.  By joining SEPIA and supporting our
funding model, academic librarians can help avoid such an outcome.  By
helping to make the SEP's funding model a success, contributing
libraries will help the SEP to set an example as a model that other
humanities publications could use to maintain free access.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a id="how">How to Contribute</a></h2>

<p>
 We hope you will be convinced by our summary of the reasons for
library participation and that you will examine the following
URLs and then register your commitment with SEPIA: </p>

 <ul>
 <li><a href="https://libraries.indiana.edu/sepia" target="other">SEPIA Home Page</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://www.pdcnet.org/sepia" target="other">SEPIA Registration Page</a> </li>
 <li><a href="SEPIA-dues-schedule.html" target="other">SEPIA Dues Schedule</a></li>
 </ul>

<p>
We hope you will choose to join us in this effort!</p>

<p>
Yours, <br />
The SEP Project Members<br />

<h2>Physicalism</h2>

<p>

It is a much bigger deal than has been recognized that the space of
perfectly natural relations must, apparently, encompass more than just
the spatiotemporal relations (and not just in some possible world, but
in the actual world). Seeing why will both showcase some of the power
Lewis&rsquo;s conception of fundamental ontology has in shaping and
clarifying metaphysical debates, and highlight a centrally important
question that he has (perhaps unintentionally) bequeathed to us.</p>

<p>

Part of Lewis&rsquo;s reductionist aspirations include a rock-solid
commitment to <em>physicalism</em>&mdash;a commitment, of course, that
is about as close to a bit of orthodoxy as one will find in
contemporary philosophy:</p>

<blockquote>
 Roughly speaking, Materialism [= physicalism] is the thesis that
 physics&mdash;something not too different from present-day physics,
 though presumably somewhat improved&mdash;is a comprehensive theory of
 the world, complete as well as correct. The world is as physics says it
 is, and there&rsquo;s no more to say. (1999, pp. 33&ndash;34)

 </blockquote>
<p>

Many questions arise when one tries to make this rough statement of
physicalism precise. We&rsquo;ll focus on just one. So suppose that, as
a first step towards precision, we take physicalism to entail that the
only perfectly natural properties are <em>physical</em>
 properties.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup>
(Perfectly natural
properties that are <em>actually</em> instantiated&mdash;the
physicalism we are trying to define is meant to be, or least to be
allowed to be, a contingent thesis.) Then our question is obvious: What
makes a property a <em>physical</em> property? Without a substantive
answer, physicalism must remain a mere framework for a
doctrine&mdash;and not something with immediate, and allegedly
profound, consequences for the nature of the mind, or of ethics,
etc.</p>

<p>

It won&rsquo;t do to say that physical properties are those
recognized by contemporary physics, since that physics may be
wrong&mdash;and at any rate, we should hope for broader scope for our
thesis than that. Nor is reference of the sort Lewis makes to a physics
&ldquo;not too different from present-day physics&rdquo; acceptable: in
general, to point to the properties recognized by present-day physics
and say only that physical properties are &ldquo;relevantly like
those&rdquo; is, however popular a strategy, nothing more than an
abdication of philosophical responsibility.</p>

<p>

There is a deeper issue. What, after all, distinguishes the
discipline of <em>physics</em> from other sciences? Just this: Physics
is the one discipline that aims at producing a correct <em>and
complete</em> theory of the world&mdash;complete, not in the sense that
it includes chemistry, biology, etc. as parts, but in the sense that it
describes those aspects of concrete reality to which all other aspects
(hence chemistry, biology, etc.) reduce. It will posit whatever
entities, properties, and relations it needs to do the
job&mdash;including, if necessary, those whose existence a
card-carrying &ldquo;physicalist&rdquo; would reject.</p>

<p>

So physicalism cannot, on pain of triviality, be taken to require
that the perfectly natural properties and relations that characterize
our world are restricted to those that would be posited by a successful
physics. It must, instead, be viewed as incorporating a
<em>substantive</em> and <em>independently specified</em> constraint on
what those properties and relations could turn out to be.</p>

<p>

To illustrate the point, imagine a vitalist who defends her view as
physicalistically respectable in the following way: &ldquo;Yes, I
believe that living things differ from non-living things in a
fundamental, irreducible respect. And I am no epiphenomenalist about
this difference: that something is <em>alive</em> matters tremendously
to, for example, <em>how it moves</em>. But I am still a physicalist
in good standing. For I believe that every concrete thing, living or
non-living, is exhaustively composed of particles, and that its
intrinsic state at any moment is completely specified by specifying
the state&mdash;the <em>physical</em> state&mdash;of this system of
particles. It is just that it is possible to have two systems of
particles in different physical states, even though there is a one-one
mapping \(f(\bullet)\) from the particles in one system to the
particles in the other such that (i) for every particle p in the first
system, p and f(p) are in the same (single-particle) physical state;
(ii) for every sequence of particles \(\langle p_1 , \ldots ,p_n\rangle\)
taken from the first system, \(\langle p_1 , \ldots ,p_n\rangle\) and \(\langle
f(p_1), \ldots, f(p_n)\rangle\) instantiate exactly the same
spatiotemporal relations. In the language of &lsquo;perfectly natural
properties and relations&rsquo;, I can put the point in this way: I
believe in perfectly natural relations among particles that are not
spatiotemporal relations. (So I am still just as much of a
metaphysical reductionist as Lewis, for I too hold that all facts
about the world are determined by the pattern of instantiation of
perfectly natural properties and relations among the fundamental
particulars.) My vitalism consists precisely in the thesis that some
particles can be related in a way that is not determined by the
monadic, perfectly natural properties these particles instantiate,
together with their spatiotemporal relations to one another. I call
this being related
<em>lifewise.</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>

Why isn&rsquo;t vitalism, so understood, perfectly compatible with
physicalism, as understood by the legions of contemporary philosophers
who subscribe to it? Not because our vitalist believes in
<em>non-physical</em> properties or relations; for if she is correct,
and physics does its job right, then physics will come to recognize,
<em>and develop theories of</em>, these properties or relations: doing
so, after all, is just part of its writ. Nor can it be said that she
denies that facts about life reduce to (or supervene on, if you like)
<em>micro</em>physical facts. This complaint might seem apt, if she
insists on characterizing life as a perfectly natural
<em>property</em>, typically had only by <em>sums</em> of particles;
one might then suspect that she posits irreducible facts that are not
facts about particles (but rather about particle-sums). But she has
deftly avoided this complaint by insisting that it is an irreducible
fact <em>about particles</em> that some of them are related lifewise.
</p>

<p>

If Almost-Lewis had been right to put forth the fifth
thesis&mdash;that the only perfectly natural relations are
spatiotemporal ones&mdash;as a <em>necessary</em> truth, then we would
have had a ready answer to vitalism: it is, at least as set forth
above, necessarily false. And even if we had <em>not</em> wished to
side with Almost-Lewis&mdash;because, specifically, we considered
vitalism to be merely <em>contingently</em> false&mdash;we might have
hoped to use his position as inspiration for the needed substantive
characterization of physicalism: Physicalism, so the story might have
gone, entails that the only perfectly natural relations instantiated in
<em>our</em> world are spatiotemporal ones (never mind that
<em>other</em> worlds feature additional perfectly natural relations).
<em>That</em> characterization is clear and substantive enough to do
real philosophical work, while respecting the typical
physicalist&rsquo;s desire to be seen as putting forth a
<em>contingent</em> thesis.</p>

<p>

In fact, however, we face a dilemma. For, as noted, quantum
mechanical entanglement pretty clearly establishes that
Almost-Lewis&rsquo;s position is false. But as far as I know, <em>no
one</em> takes it to establish that physicalism is
false&mdash;certainly, Lewis himself did not. But then one wonders what
the content of Lewis&rsquo;s (and everyone else&rsquo;s) physicalism
really is. At all events, here is a proposal: Physicalism should be
construed as entailing a constraint on what perfectly natural relations
there are. (For if it doesn&rsquo;t, then as we have seen it will be
too weak even to rule out vitalism.) Taking it as non-negotiable that
spatiotemporal relations are perfectly natural, the question then
becomes this: What <em>other</em> sorts of relations can be admitted as
perfectly natural, without violating physicalism? Almost-Lewis provided
the simplest answer: \(No\) others. That won&rsquo;t do, and so we
need a fallback answer. I take it to be an important piece of
unfinished business in Lewis&rsquo;s metaphysical
program&mdash;important even for those who do not subscribe to that
program&mdash;to figure out what that fallback answer should be.</p>

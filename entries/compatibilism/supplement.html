<h2>Compatibilism: State of the Art</h2>

<p>

Those interested in the state of the art are invited to read this
supplementary section. It surveys six of the positions currently on
stage. Each view will receive only a brief discussion. [For other
survey-oriented discussions of the state of the art for compatibilism,
see the essays by Berofsky (2002), Haji (2002), and Russell (2002b) in
Kane, ed. (2002).  See also Levy and McKenna, 2008.] More advanced
treatment is best found in the current journals or directly from the
relevant author's book-length treatments.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>

Before discussing any particular view, it is worth focusing upon two
related issues that have an important bearing upon contemporary
compatibilism.  One involves a forceful style of argument for
incompatibilism.  Another concerns a distinction that is thought by
some compatibilists to be useful in replying to this sort of
argumentation.</p>

<h4>The argument</h4>

<p>Frankfurt's (section 5.3), Wolf's (section 5.4), and Fischer's
(section 5.5) views all face problems with an especially troubling set
of manipulation cases. Recall, in these sorts of cases, an
incompatibilist opponent puts before the compatibilist a case
involving an agent who, the incompatibilist alleges, satisfies
pertinent compatibilist-friendly sufficient conditions for moral
responsibility&mdash;hierarchies, meshes, or mechanisms&mdash;but who
comes to satisfy those conditions through a process of manipulation
that intuitively suggests that the agent is not free and morally
responsible for some act, <em>X</em>, which she performs (say killing
an innocent person).  With such an example in hand, the
incompatibilist then constructs a <em>Manipulation Argument</em>.  She
argues roughly as follows: (1) Any agent so manipulated
into <em>X</em>-ing is not free or morally responsible, despite
satisfying the pertinent compatibilist-friendly conditions.  (2) Any
agent who is determined to <em>X</em> is no different in any relevant
respect from an agent manipulated into <em>X</em>-ing in the manner
specified. Therefore, (3) any agent who is determined to <em>X</em>
(or, generalizing, perform any other action) does not <em>X</em>
freely and is not morally responsible for <em>X</em>-ing.</p>

<p>

Various philosophers have developed some version of a manipulation
argument (e.g., Kane, 1996, and Taylor, 1974).  But recently the force
of it has been crystallized by Derk Pereboom with his Four-Case
Argument for incompatibilism (2001). [In section F below, I will
consider yet another highly influential recent manipulation-like
argument for incompatibilism by Alfred Mele.]  Like others who have
developed similar arguments, Pereboom initially draws upon a case of
covert manipulation of an agent by direct electronic stimulation of
her brain, causing her every moment to moment decision and action in
such a way that she still satisfies (says Pereboom) what various
compatibilists contend is sufficient for moral responsibility.  And
yet, Pereboom claims, this agent is clearly not free or morally
responsible when she commits an act of murder.  So far, we have here
roughly the same argumentation as others have advanced.  But Pereboom
then appeals to a simple principle of moral reasoning: treat like
cases alike.  He then considers a second manipulation case in which
the manipulators tinker with the agent from a temporal distance by
&ldquo;programming in&rdquo; the relevant psychological details that
will later lead to the agent's act of murder.  The agent then lives
out what is seemingly a normal life until one day the relevant act is
done.  Since, he argues, there is no relevant difference between the
first case and the second, and since we must treat like cases alike,
the agent in the second case is also not free or morally responsible.
But now, if we shift to a third case and make the relevant
&ldquo;manipulation&rdquo; the strong indoctrination of the person in
her early childhood through her youth, this process is not different
in any relevant respect from the pre-programing from a temporal
distance that occurs in case two.  And so here too, when the agent
murders, we should conclude that the agent is not free and
responsible.  Finally, Pereboom argues that the best explanation for
why these first three agents are not free and responsible is because
the process of manipulation deterministically caused each of them to
act as they did.  And so, finally, in a fourth case in which a
normally developed agent at a determined world murders, this case also
is no different from the others, and given that we should treat like
cases alike, we should conclude that, due to determinism, this agent
is not responsible.  In all four cases, what underwrites the lack of
freedom or responsibility, Pereboom concludes, is the fact that the
source of the agent's actions can be traced back in their entirety to
originating conditions that were completely beyond her control.</p>

<p>

Note that Pereboom's conclusion can be used to help advance the first
premise of the source incompatibilist argument (discussed in section
2.2).  That premise states that a person acts of her own free will
only if she is its ultimate source. A lively literature has emerged
around Pereboom's Four-Case Argument, and it, along with one other (to
be discussed in section F below), has emerged as a kind of litmus test
for the credibility of a compatibilist theory: Can such and such
theory provide an adequate answer to Pereboom's Four-Case
Argument? </p>

<p>

Compatibilists will respond in one of two different ways to a
manipulation argument.  Some will be inclined to reject the first
premise and argue that if the manipulation is sufficiently complex,
despite how sweeping and pervasive it might be, such an agent will in
fact act of her own free will and be morally responsible for what she
does.  This compatibilist strategy is one of defying what at least
appears to be intuitive plausibility.  Other compatibilists, however,
will be inclined to reject the second premise, arguing that the
pertinent style of manipulation (the one made use of in the argument
under consideration, such as direct stimulation of the brain) is
relevantly different than a normal causally deterministic history
whereby an agent comes to perform a relevant act.  It is at this
point, when reflecting on strategies for resisting the second premise,
that a certain distinction has proved useful.</p>

<h4>The distinction</h4>

<p>Many compatibilists inclined to resist the second premise in
relevant manipulation arguments want to show that some causal
histories giving rise to agents and their actions are
freedom-and-responsibility-undermining while others are not.  Of
course, these compatibilists will try to show that determinism is
consistent with a history that is not freedom-or-responsibility
undermining, whereas the manipulation featured in (some of) the
arguments is.  A very plausible way to make the divide between those
who would emphasize the relevance of causal history to freedom and
responsibility and those who would not is to distinguish between
<em>internalist</em> theories of free will and moral responsibility on
the one hand, and <em>externalist</em> theories of free will and moral
responsibility on the other (for example, see Mele 1995; and Fischer
and Ravizza, 1998). Internalist theories look only to internal
features of an agent's psychological resources as they pertain to the
production of free and morally responsible action. They acknowledge
that any manner of acquisition of the relevant psychological structure
or mesh is irrelevant to whether at a moment in time it provides an
agent with a freedom-and-responsibility-conferring
structure. Internalist theories are thus
<em>current time-slice theories</em>. They require only the
satisfaction of a certain psychological structure at a moment in time.
In this way, internalist compatibilist conditions for free will and
moral responsibility are comparable to other <em>current time-slice
properties</em> such as weight or shape, neither of which are impugned
by the manner in which an object comes to have the weight or shape it
has. These sorts of properties are often called <em>snapshot
properties</em>. Externalist theories consider external features of an
agent's psychological resources as they pertain to the production of
action. They acknowledge that the
freedom-and-responsibility-conferring psychological structure sought
at a moment in time is partially determined by the causal history
giving rise to that structure at that moment in time. That history
will include causal features stretching outside the agent herself,
such as the manner of education and socialization that shapes a
person's values and beliefs. Externalist theories are
thus <em>historical theories</em>. They require a sort of history that
is freedom and responsibility-conferring as opposed to freedom and
responsibility-threatening. In this way, externalist compatibilist
conditions for free will and moral responsibility are comparable to
other <em>historical properties</em>, such as being a sunburn or being
a genuine dollar bill, each of which requires a certain causal
history: If a burn is not caused by the sun, then it cannot be a
sunburn; if a dollar is not produced by the relevant
government-sanctioned means, then it is not genuine but
counterfeit.</p>

<p>

In a highly influential paper, &ldquo;Responsibility and the Limits of
Evil: Variations on a Strawsonian Theme,&rdquo; the compatibilist Gary
Watson took a very honest look at how historical considerations
influence intuitive judgments of moral responsibility (1987). While
entertaining the internalist position, Watson proceeded to call
attention, in forceful detail, to just how much historical
considerations <em>do</em> matter. Watson focused upon a case of
extreme evil, a horrible crime by Robert Alton Harris for the murder
of two young boys. Drawing upon a couple of articles from the <em>Los
Angeles Times</em>, Watson first quoted a description of Harris's
crime and his attitude afterwards. The story is sickening. Harris's
was an act of astounding callousness. But Watson then quotes from a
follow up article in which Harris's life was detailed, a life
punctuated almost exclusively by abuse and cruelty, youth detention
centers and then adult prisons. Watson is careful to avoid the
suggestion that Harris's history caused him to be in some way
incapacitated for morally responsible agency. Indeed, on an
internalist, compatibilist-friendly account, it looked as if Harris
had a terrible history that caused his being a free and morally
responsible agent&mdash;an especially morally contemptuous one. But
Watson observes that a recognition of Harris' past gives one reason to
regard with ambivalence judgments of blame.  Somehow recognizing a
history that shapes a person to be terribly evil can influence our
judgments of a person's moral responsibility for even the most evil of
conduct.</p>

<p>

Watson's essay and the case he featured have had a powerful influence
on recent compatibilist work. The compatibilist does have a burden
here, and Watson makes this clear. How is it that histories matter?
Even the internalist should have something to say in response to the
appearance that they do. Of course, the internalist's response will
have to show that when histories do matter, they aid in understanding
a freedom-and-responsibility-undermining impairment that itself
involves only snapshot properties.</p>

<h3>A. Identification, Hierarchy &amp; Mesh Theories</h3>

<p>

As discussed above (in section 5.3), Frankfurt's hierarchical theory
needed supplementing so as to avoid the problem of an ever ascending
conflict of higher-order desires. Recall that one way an agent's
freedom might be jeopardized is when she faces conflicting first-order
desires. Frankfurt theorized that an agent's freedom (of the sort
required for moral responsibility) consisted in her being able to form
second-order volitional desires through which she would
<em>identify</em> herself with one desire and distance herself from
another. (This formed the basis for categorizing Frankfurt's as a real
self theory.) But this hierarchical step is not alone sufficient to
capture the relevant freedom since an agent could also face conflicts
at the level of second-order, or even higher orders, of desire.
</p>
 

<p>

The viability of Frankfurt's hierarchical model as developed in his
earlier work was in jeopardy. His account of identification needed
buttressing. Frankfurt's more recent work on the topics of freedom and
the will, as well as different features of personhood (such as the
emotion of love), bolster his original appeal to identification, an
appeal which previously rested solely on an agent's <em>having</em> a
higher-order volitional desire that some first-order desires be
effective in leading her to act. One effort Frankfurt made to speak to
the problem of conflicting higher-order desires is to hold that a
person properly identifies with a lower-order desire (normally a
first-order desire) when she has an
<em>unopposed</em> higher-order volition to act in accord with the
lower-order desire, <em>and</em> she judges that further deliberation
would not influence her resolve (1987). But suppose that a person's
unopposed higher-order desire, the one on the basis of which
Frankfurt's theory grounds the person's identification, is one towards
which the agent is <em>passive</em>. The person's will is affected by
this desire as an external one that has, so to speak, merely
&ldquo;happened&rdquo; to the agent. (Consider the case of a willing
addict who has simply given up the struggle and drearily resigned
herself to her addiction. She'll be willing; why resist? There is
nothing she can do to stop the train she is on!) Such a person would
satisfy Frankfurt's amended theory, but still seem not to identify in a
deep sense with her will&mdash;not in a way that would reveal her real self.
So Frankfurt further amended his view with the requirement that an
agent's identification must be <em>active</em>. Her stance towards her
own will is that it <em>determines itself</em> (1994). She and it are
fully integrated. When an agent's will is so fashioned, then she
reveals her real self in it; she regards it
<em>wholeheartedly</em>.</p>

<p>

Not long after Frankfurt presented the earlier formulation of his
hierarchical theory, Gary Watson offered an alternative model (1975).
Like Frankfurt, Watson was interested in accounting for free and
morally responsible agency in terms of a kind of harmony or mesh
between different elements in the mental economy of persons qua
agents.  Of course, as noted earlier (section 5.3.3), it was Watson
who originally objected to Frankfurt's mere appeal to higher-order
desires to account for identification.  This precipitated Frankfurt's
further amendments. But Watson also offered an alternative proposal
based on a Platonic conception of motivation wherein judgment or
evaluation can be its own source of motivation.  The proper way to
account for an agent who acts freely and who, in Frankfurt's terms,
would identify with the sources of her agency is not in terms of a
proper mesh located in the structures of desires in a hierarchy, but
rather between different systems within an agent; one being her motivational
system, which is influenced by elements such as one's appetitive
desires; and another being her valuational system, whereby an agent judges what
she takes to be valuable (some might just say, good, or instead,
desirable).  A free agent is one whose motivational system works in
harmony with her valuational system.  On Watson's account, it seems
that if anything is to do the work of identification, it is an agent's
valuational system, which apparently can be plagued by opposing
desires arising from an agent's motivational system, gumming up the
works and causing agents to act unfreely or against their wills by
virtue of acting contrary to what they judge it best to do.</p>

<p>

As J. David Velleman has pointed out (1992), the trouble is that
Watson's appeal to a valuational system seems susceptible to the same
sort of objection that he (Watson) put to Frankfurt.  Why take an
agent's judgment issuing from her valuational system to be the source
of who she is, what she identifies with, and hence, the spring of her
free action? Velleman's insightful question brings into clear relief
that once we begin to theorize about free and morally responsible
agency in terms of the structure of an agent's will, however the mesh
is alleged to be harmonized, whatever the elements specified as the
basis for a kind of identification with the agent, we can always ask
why these elements are to play that role. The puzzle has sparked a
great deal of controversy in recent work (such as Velleman's own 2000,
Watson's 2004, and several essays in the 2002 collection by Buss and
Overton).</p>

<p>

In a series of recent papers, Michael Bratman has embraced the
problematic framed by the controversy between Frankfurt and Watson,
and has offered a distinctive attempt to answer Velleman's challenge
(see, e.g., Bratman, 1997, 2003, 2004, and several of the essays in
his 2007 collection).  Bratman builds an account of morally
responsible agency by drawing upon his planning theory of intentions.
According to Bratman, intentions are explained by taking them, in
typical cases, to be embedded in larger plans.  An agent's intentional
actions are understood as intentional in light of plans into which her
actions fit.  My intention to head to the local pub, for instance, is
understood as intentional in relation to my plan of meeting my friends
there for an evening of good cheer.  Note that here too we have a kind
of meshing of one element, an intention, within wider aspects of
agency, a plan (Bratman, 1997), and while this is not itself a matter
of hierarchy, it is suggestive that at a more primitive level of
agency, a kind of mesh is required for persons to get about in the
world, to make today's activities gel with tomorrow's travel plans,
and to make tomorrow's travel plans conform with the unexpected
contingencies that tomorrow might turn up.  Turning directly to the
question of why Frankfurtian wholeheartedness or Watsonian valuation
has &ldquo;agential authority&rdquo; to speak for the agent, for her source of
identification, of who she is, Bratman looks not as Frankfurt does to
higher-order desires, nor as Watson does to evaluative judgments, but
instead to what Bratman calls an <em>intention-based theory</em>
(2007, p. 239) in which an agent's commitment to self-governing
policies of practical reasoning and action take center stage.  These
policies will involve diachronic commitments to managing one's life in
ways that allow her to be effective in carrying out her other plans
and intentions.  A commitment to work hard after dinner, for example,
will constrain other potential plans.  It will be given a ranking
priority that will help one across the stretch of large swaths of the
days.  Such a self-governing policy will also be hierarchical, though
in a way that differs from Frankfurt's.  It will be hierarchical in so
far as it will govern (by constraining or fostering) other plans that
are liable to arise in the course of a life (2007, pp.240&ndash;3).  But now
why will such a self-governing policy, as opposed to other candidate
features of agency (such as higher-order desires), have the authority
to speak for the agent?  One reason Bratman offers is because it will
bind the agent's activities across time with the same threads that
bind her identity across time, and so, in a sense, will capture her
depth as an agent, who she truly is (2007, pp.243&ndash;9).</p>

<p>

Bratman's intention-based theory of morally responsible agency offers
an intriguing addition to other mesh theories such as Watson's and
Frankfurt's.  But along with theirs, there remain worries about how to
unpack notions such as &ldquo;real self&rdquo;, &ldquo;agential
authority&rdquo;, and what is meant by that which &ldquo;speaks for an
agent&rdquo;.  One factor that clearly drives all of these mesh
theorists' concerns is the need to account for such phenomena as
weakness of will and compulsion.  A case of compulsion due to an
irresistible desire seems clearly a
freedom-and-responsibility-undermining condition (assuming that the
person who suffers it is not responsible for acquiring it).  One way
to account for such a case, it is thought, is by showing that the
problematic desire is in some way alien to the agent, or to what
&ldquo;speaks for&rdquo; the agent; it's not part of her &ldquo;real
self&rdquo;. But opponents, such as reasons-responsive theorists,
might be inclined to think that instead we get a much more elegant
explanation&mdash;one that avoids the metaphorical language often invoked
in the mesh theorists' proposals&mdash;by thinking about what an agent
controls or has control over, rather than what is part of an agent's
deep self, or what elements of the agent have agential authority, or
instead speak for the agent (see, for example, Mele, 1995).</p>

<p>

Perhaps Frankfurt's treatment of wholeheartedness has shielded his
hierarchical view from the problem of ever ascending conflicts amongst
higher-order desires. Or perhaps instead Watson's or Bratman's
proposal will help to account for the core insights of a mesh theory.
How do such views stand up to manipulation arguments?  How, for
instance, does Frankfurt respond to worries about manipulation? Could
Frankfurt's compatibilist-friendly conditions be artificially induced
in an agent at a time in such a way that she could just, right then,
as an internalist would have it, satisfy conditions sufficient for
moral responsibility? In considering the prospect of adding to his
account an historical condition so as to rule out manipulation cases,
Frankfurt writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What we need most essentially to look at is, rather, certain
aspects of the psychic structure that is coincident with the person's
behavior&hellip;.</p>
 
<p>

A manipulator may succeed, through his interventions, in providing a
person not merely with particular feelings and thoughts but with a new
character. That person is then morally responsible for the choices and
the conduct to which having this character leads. We are inevitably
fashioned and sustained, after all, by circumstances over which we have
no control. The causes to which we are subject may also change us
radically, without thereby bringing it about that we are not morally
responsible agents. It is irrelevant whether those causes are operating
by virtue of the natural forces that shape our environment or whether
they operate through the deliberate manipulative designs of other human
agents (2002, p. 27).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

For Frankfurt, free will and moral responsibility are snapshot
properties. Frankfurt is a pure internalist. Tough-minded
compatibilist that he is, he simply bites the bullet: In pertinent
cases, determined agents are no different in any relevant respect from
manipulated agents.  Still, some of the latter, and likewise, some of
the former, act of their own free will. (Various critics have argued
against Frankfurt on this very point, including Fischer and Ravizza,
1998; Haji, 1998; and Mele, 1995.  For a limited defense of
Frankfurt's internalist position, see McKenna, 2004.)</p>

<p>

Notice, however, that Bratman's mesh theory, unlike Frankfurt's,
commits Bratman to an historical thesis, since for him, what is at the
core of his theory of morally responsible agency is a planning
theory of intentions in which an agent's intentions at a time are
accounted for in terms of her trans-temporal relations to past
activities and future commitments.  This makes clear that, as an
externalist, Bratman will respond to some manipulation challenges by
arguing that agents who are manipulated in ways that break the threads
that bind their present mental lives to their own pasts have had their
responsible agency violated, and so are not morally responsible for
what they do.  (Here Bratman would deny the first premise of a
manipulation argument, as I have characterized it above.)  This,
however, might not be enough for Bratman to answer some versions of a
manipulation argument.  Consider, for instance, Pereboom's second
case, of the agent who is manipulated from a temporal distance, so
that her later intentions and plans are &ldquo;programmed in&rdquo; at an early
time, maybe at her birth.  If the program is written to account for
the trans-temporal commitments, we have the makings of a manipulation
argument that can &ldquo;load in&rdquo;, so to speak, Bratman's historical
requirements.</p>

<h3>B. Moderate Reasons-Responsiveness</h3>

<p>

In recent work, John Martin Fischer joined company with Mark
Ravizza. Together they addressed unsettled business left in Fischer's
earlier reasons-responsive account. As set out above (see section
5.5), Fischer defends a mechanism-based, actual sequence form of
reasons-responsiveness. This view allows Fischer to couple
reasons-responsiveness with guidance control as the freedom-relevant
condition for moral responsibility. His earlier account faced two
serious problems, of which he was fully aware. One had to do with a
proper specification of the scope of the reasons to which a morally
responsible agent's mechanism of action is responsive. Making the
mechanism too responsive to reasons (via strong
reasons-responsiveness) sets the bar too high. Those doing moral wrong
knowingly would fall short, and hence count as not acting
freely <em>merely by virtue of their wrongful conduct</em>. But making
the mechanism too unresponsive (via weak reasons-responsiveness)
allowed a person with only a very limited or insane pattern of
sensitivity to reasons to count as satisfying the freedom
condition. This set the bar too low. Another problem that Fischer's
earlier account faced had to do with how an agent might come to own
the reasons-responsive mechanism that does issue in her freely willed
actions. This problem was connected with manipulation worries since,
without some ownership condition on a reasons-responsive mechanism,
Fischer's view was open to criticism by appeal to cases in which an
agent acts from an artificially installed reasons-responsive
mechanism. In <em>Responsibility and Control: A Theory of Moral
Responsibility</em> (1998), Fischer and Ravizza advance a rich account
of guidance control designed to address these two problems.</p>

<h4>B.1 Moderate Reasons-Responsive Mechanisms</h4>

<p>

Fischer and Ravizza seek to slip between the two extremes of weak and
strong reasons-responsiveness by advancing an account of moderate
reasons-responsiveness (1998, pp. 62-91). Essentially, their goal is
to show that an appropriately sensitive reasons-responsive mechanism
responds to a rich pattern of reasons, reasons that
hang together rationally as a class and fit a coherent or sane
pattern. All the same, the mechanism needn't respond to all good
reasons to act otherwise. As just one example of what Fischer and
Ravizza have in mind, suppose Matilda, who is at a dance, is having
the time of her life and would not stop waltzing for $100.00, or for
any number of other reasons that might be put to her. But if waltzing
Matilda were offered $1,000.00 to stop dancing, needing the money as
she does, she would stop dancing. If this reason is to aid in
confirming the basic rationality and sanity that might bear on
Matilda's conduct, then other like weighted reasons would have to
affect her mechanism of action similarly. So suppose that Matilda
would not stop Waltzing for $1,001.00, or for any other sum of money
other than precisely $1,000.00. Then Matilda, it seems, would not act
from a mechanism that was responsive to fairly modest rational
constraints. Matilda would <em>not</em> act from an appropriately
reasons-responsive mechanism.</p>

<p>

If instead Matilda would respond to a coherent pattern of reasons
(e.g., bribes of $1,000.00 or higher, and other sorts of incentives),
then she would act from a sufficiently reasons-responsive mechanism,
<em>even if it was not a strongly responsive one</em>. That is, it is
acceptable if the mechanism from whence Matilda acts is not responsive
to all good reasons to so act. For instance, if Matilda had been told
that her mother had been seriously injured in an accident and needed
her help, perhaps Matilda would not have stopped waltzing even then.
She might even have continued waltzing while recognizing herself, by
her own standards of decent conduct, that she should stop. Imagine her
proclaiming as she continued to waltz, &ldquo;I really ought to stop
and help dear old mum out, but I just am having too much fun!&rdquo;
Matilda's insensitivity to this sufficient reason to act otherwise
would not impugn the requisite responsiveness of Matilda's mechanism of
action just so long as her insensitivity to this reason is situated
within a set of cases that demonstrate a rich sensitivity to some
rational and stable range of reasons.</p>

<p>

This brief description of Fischer and Ravizza's analysis of
reasons-responsiveness barely scratches the surface of their account.
For instance, Fischer and Ravizza distinguish between different
features of reasons-responsiveness. A typical deliberative mechanism
in the actional repertoire of a normally functioning agent involves
elements that are <em>receptive</em> to reasons, and other elements
that are <em>reactive</em> to reasons. One feature of responsiveness,
the receptivity feature, allows an agent to come up with and process
good reasons. Another feature, the reactivity feature, allows an agent
to act upon the good reasons the agent recognizes at the receptivity
stage. (In the example of Matilda and her injured mother, Matilda, by
way of her mechanism of action, was receptive to the reason to stop
waltzing and help her mother. But she was not reactive to it.) Fischer
and Ravizza also require that the mechanism be responsive to some
moral reasons.</p>

<p>

Several intricate debates have now emerged in discussion of Fischer
and Ravizza's account of a moderately reasons-responsive
mechanism. (See, for example, McKenna, 2000, 2001b; Mele, 2000;
Russell, 2002a, 2002b; Todd &amp; Tognazzini, 2008; Stump, 1996b; and
Watson, 2001.  And for replies to several of his critics, see
Fischer's 2004 and 2006.) For instance, on Fischer and Ravizza's view,
a determined agent can be blameworthy for knowingly doing moral wrong
from a reasons-responsive mechanism because, were
different reasons brought to bear upon her mechanism of
action, the agent, by way of the mechanism, would act otherwise. But
consider the reason to act otherwise that was present to the agent in
the actual world (not doing moral wrong), the one the agent actually
ignored. Given that determinism is true in the actual world, in the
nearest possible world in which that very same reason is present, the
agent does not respond differently to it. Hence, given that the agent
is determined, it <em>seems</em> that she is not reactive to the very
reason that serves as the basis for moral blame in the actual
world. It is because she did not respond appropriately to the moral
wrongness she herself recognized that she is blameworthy. The irony
seems to be this: On Fischer and Ravizza's view, that an agent
satisfies the freedom relevant condition for moral responsibility is
confirmed by her reactivity to reasons other than the one that serves
as the basis for blaming her in the actual world. That very reason,
the one she failed to act on, because determinism is true, is one to
which she does
<em>not</em> react (McKenna, 2000, 2005; and Russell, 2002a). Although the
consequence might be ironic, is it reason to reject the view? This is
just one point of controversy currently taking shape over the details
of Fischer and Ravizza's account of moderate
reasons-responsiveness.</p>

<h4>B.2 Taking Ownership of One's Reasons-Responsive Mechanisms</h4>

<p>

What about the other difficulty Fischer faced in his earlier defense
of reasons-responsive compatibilism? How do Fischer and Ravizza stave
off manipulation cases involving
freedom-and-responsibility-undermining implantation of
reasons-responsive mechanisms? Can they meet a well crafted
manipulation argument?  They endorse the externalist position that
only a certain sort of history will permit a reasons-responsive action
to issue appropriately in freely willed actions (1998,
pp. 194&ndash;206). This history, they theorize, is resistant to fabrication
through artificial means. Hence, Fischer and Ravizza treat free will
and moral responsibility as historical and not snapshot
properties.</p>

<p>

According to Fischer and Ravizza, an agent's mechanism is
appropriately reasons-responsive, and issues in conduct constitutive of
guidance control, only if she has come to own that mechanism by means
of a process whereby she <em>takes responsibility</em> for the
mechanisms giving rise to her actions (1998, pp. 207&ndash;39). On their
view, taking responsibility involves a subjective component. In order
to take responsibility for her conduct, <em>an agent must see herself
in a certain manner</em>. According to Fischer and Ravizza, taking
responsibility requires that an agent recognize that her conduct is
efficacious in altering the outcome of the world around her, and she
accepts that the spectrum of morally reactive attitudes of others can
be properly directed at her. That is, she acknowledges the propriety of
members of the moral community placing moral expectations upon her that
she guide her conduct within certain boundaries. Further, she must come
to these beliefs through an appropriate means (and not, for instance,
through deception or brainwashing or trickery in some manner or other).
Fischer and Ravizza maintain that when an agent does come to take
responsibility for her mechanisms of action through this means, she
owns her mechanisms of action, and when they are moderately responsive
to reasons, then she acts with guidance control and has satisfied the
freedom-relevant condition for morally responsible agency.</p>

<p>

It is easy to see how the historical resources upon which Fischer and
Ravizza draw allow them to handle certain formulations of a
manipulation argument.  In particular, they seem easily able to handle
any instance of that argument that builds upon a case of
manipulation in which an agent is massively altered at a moment in
time, say by being given a Frankfurtian desire structure that she
previously lacked, or by having numerous reasons-responsive
mechanisms installed in an instant.  Or consider a case introduced by Mele
(1995) of a person, Beth, who is subject to overnight brainwashing
without her knowledge so as to render her a near psychological
duplicate of another agent, Ann (when prior to the intervention, Beth
was nothing like Ann).  When Beth the next day acts on her newly
installed values and such, it seems that she is not free in the way
Ann is, even if both agents act in the same way and are at the time of
action roughly intrinsically psychological duplicates.  Fischer and
Ravizza have a clear way of accounting for these sorts of manipulation
cases: The agents in them, such as Beth, did not acquire the relevant
springs of their actions under their own steam, but were caused to do
so in ways that subverted their freedom and responsibility.  And this
causal process is very different from one that, even at a determined
world, is the outgrowth of an agent coming to take responsibility for
the mechanisms (or springs) of her own actions as she grows out of
childhood and into adulthood.  Note that this allows Fischer and
Ravizza to reject the second premise in the formulation of the
manipulation argument as set out above (in the introduction), which
contends that an agent so manipulated is no different in any relevant
respect from an agent caused to be in such a state due to a normal
deterministic history.</p>

<p>

Trouble, however, seems to arise for other sorts of manipulation cases
and the arguments built upon them.  The problem is that Fischer and
Ravizza do not (and perhaps cannot) foreclose a kind of manipulation
whereby part of the way the agent is manipulated is by way of causing
all of the subjective processes through which she takes responsibility
for the mechanisms of her actions (see, e.g., McKenna, 2000; Mele,
2000; Stump, 1996b, and 2002; and D. Zimmerman, 2002).  Note that,
according to Pereboom (2001, p. 121), his Four-Case Argument can be
adjusted so that the details of how the agents in each of his first
three cases are manipulated will include causes about how the agents
come to view themselves subjectively and thereby take responsibility
for their mechanisms of action.  And in these cases, the agents will,
Pereboom contends, satisfy Fischer and Ravizza's sufficient conditions
for moral responsibility, and yet the agents so manipulated will not
be free or responsible.</p>

<p>

The debate between Fischer and Pereboom remains very much alive.  (See
Fischer's reply in 2004, and 2006; Pereboom's counter in Fischer,
et. al. 2007; and Fischer's further reply in Fischer. et. al. 2007.)
An instructive general point to note from the preceding
discussion&mdash;one that applies beyond the controversy over just Fischer
and Ravizza's particular compatibilist theory&mdash;is that externalism
will not automatically shield the compatibilist from manipulation
cases that (apparently?) do the work of satisfying a set of
compatibilist sufficient conditions for moral responsibility; all that
needs to be done is for an incompatibilist pressing the argument, such
as Pereboom, to build the relevant historical requirements in.  Then
it looks like even these historical compatibilists will have to reject
the first premise of a manipulation argument, and so contend that an
agent manipulated in such a way is, after all, free and morally
responsible.  [See McKenna, 2004 for this point.  Note that Fischer
goes part of the way here, as regards Pereboom's formulation, since he
does grant (at 2006, p.232) that in Pereboom's first three cases, the
agents are morally responsible.  But he really does only go part of
the way, as he also claims that none of the agents are blameworthy,
due to the manipulation.  This point of Fischer's is subtle and cannot
be explored further here.]</p>

<p>

Set aside the controversy over the manipulation argument.  The
subjectivist feature of Fischer and Ravizza's view is also subject to
scrutiny. It entails that a person could be exempt from moral
responsibility merely by failing to adopt the proper subjective
perspective on her own conduct. Often a failure to take
responsibility for one's conduct, a failure to see oneself as the
source of moral harm, is precisely the basis for one's responsibility
and guilt (see Eshleman, 2001). Fischer and Ravizza defend their
subjectivist component against this sort of objection, and indeed,
their defense might withstand the heat put to it. </p>

<h3>C. A Desire-Based Reasons-Responsiveness Theory</h3>

<p>

Ishtiyaque Haji defends a form of reasons-responsive compatibilism
that differs in certain respects from Fischer and Ravizza's. In his
book <em>Moral Appraisability</em>, Haji shares with Fischer and
Ravizza a rejection of regulative in favor of guidance control as
applied to judgments of moral responsibility (1998, pp. 16&ndash;41). Haji
also shares with Fischer and Ravizza a mechanism-based
reasons-responsive approach that holds fixed in analysis the springs of
action actually operative in bringing about a freely willed action
(1998, pp. 65&ndash;85). What, according to Haji, is held fixed in analysis
is the motivational precursor of an action (a volitional desire), along
with an agent's evaluative scheme. Fischer and Ravizza, unlike Haji, do
not provide this sort of specificity as to what in the
actual sequence is held constant. They merely speculate that some
subset of an agent's psychological characteristics plays the relevant causal
role in bringing about action. Fischer and Ravizza simply call
that&mdash;whatever it is&mdash;the mechanism of action. On Fischer and
Ravizza's view, it is this that gets held constant in analyses designed
to demonstrate responsiveness to reason. Haji, on the other hand, gives
content to what is held constant.</p>

<p>

Haji's mechanism-based, reasons-responsive analysis of guidance
control (Haji calls it volitional control) appears to have a
theoretical advantage over Fischer and Ravizza's. In specifying the
mechanism giving rise to freely willed action, Haji fixes upon some
psychic features of agency that allow one to speculate about what
flexibility one can place upon <em>the</em> mechanism while still
assuming that it remains the same mechanism in different thought
experiments. But Fischer and Ravizza, relying only upon examples and
intuitive treatments of them, have no principled basis for mechanism
individuation.</p>

<p>

To bring into relief how Haji's identity constraints on a mechanism of
action differ from Fischer and Ravizza's, consider the following
problem faced by Fischer and Ravizza. In speculating about whether a
mechanism is reactive to reasons, Fischer and Ravizza imagine an
example in which an agent's mechanism reacts differently only when an
agent gets &ldquo;considerably more energy or focus when presented
with a <em>strong</em> reason to do otherwise&rdquo; (1998,
p. 74). Their example involves a person, Brown, addicted to Plezu (a
highly pleasurable drug). Rather than conclude that this sort of case
confirms that the same sort of mechanism might possess the capacity to
react to just some range of reasons, Fischer and Ravizza conclude
that, as the agent responds differently only to reasons of a certain
strength, then it must be that a different mechanism is at work, a
mechanism different from the one that is <em>not</em> reactive to
(weaker) reasons. The difficulty with this response for Fischer and
Ravizza is that it appears that there is simply no basis for
interpreting the imagined data as they do (McKenna, 2001b). What
speaks against simply saying that the very same mechanism possesses a
general capacity to react differently <em>only to reasons of a certain
strength</em>? Fischer and Ravizza want to avoid this latter
interpretation because it counts against their thesis that all that is
required for demonstrating reasons-reactivity is that an agent's
mechanism react differently to any one reason. A single case, Fischer
and Ravizza hold, confirms a general capacity to react differently
to <em>any</em> reason to which the agent's mechanism of action is
receptive. But if it turned out that the mechanism of action seemed
only to react to reasons of a certain strength, this would undermine
the thesis that the mechanism possesses the general capacity to react
to <em>all</em> reasons put to it. Instead, in light of its merely
reacting to a few strong reasons, it would seem only to reflect a
general capacity to react to strong reasons, not any reasons. As
Fischer and Ravizza acknowledge (1998, p.73), this would in turn
create problems fitting their reasons-responsive theory for
compatibilism.</p>

<p>

An advantage of Haji's mechanism-based reasons-responsive account is
that his offers some theoretical basis with which to handle the sort of
thought experiment that poses problems for Fischer and Ravizza's view
(McKenna, 2001a). The proximal desire (the mechanism) that Haji seeks
to hold fixed in assessing reasons-responsiveness is fixed, on Haji's
view, by a motivational base and an evaluative scheme. Drawing upon
Alfred Mele's work, Haji explains that a motivational base of any
desire contains positive and negative elements that figure in the
motivational strength of that desire. These factors comprise the total
motivational base of a desire. On Haji's view, a desire is the same
desire operative in different scenarios if one holds fixed the
motivational base of the desire. Applied to cases of addiction, Haji's
identification of a mechanism of action should get Fischer and Ravizza
the result that they want. A severe addict <em>will</em> act from a
different sort of mechanism than the sort that a normally functioning agent
will act upon. The general capacities to react will be impaired. An
addict's volitional desire, given such a strong motivational base for
the drug, will react only to certain sorts of reasons (such as fear of
immediate death). This sort of mechanism of action will not be
sufficiently reactive to the domain of good reasons to conclude that
the agent acts freely when she acts from such a mechanism. Of course,
<em>there is absolutely no reason that Fischer and Ravizza cannot see
Haji's account as a friendly amendment to their approach</em>.</p>

<p>

Also, like Fischer and Ravizza's, Haji's compatibilism is
externalist. But Haji places the historical requirement in a different
place from where other theorists such as Fischer and Ravizza do. For
Fischer and Ravizza, the historical constraint on moral responsibility
comes as a component of the freedom or control condition for morally
responsible agency. So, for Fischer and Ravizza, guidance control
requires the satisfaction of two conditions: that the mechanism of
action is moderately reasons-responsive, and that an agent went through
a process whereby she took responsibility for her mechanism of action
(the latter is where the historical properties come in). But Haji's
treats a reasons-responsive mechanism of action as sufficient to
satisfy the freedom or control condition necessary for moral
responsibility. This seems only to require internalist, snapshot
properties. Instead, Haji maintains that a condition for morally
responsible agency distinct from the freedom or control condition is
where an historical element emerges. According to Haji, a morally
responsible agent must act freely from an authentic evaluative scheme,
a scheme that is genuinely hers, and not one forced upon her by
indoctrination, or electronic implantation, or by other means of
manipulation (1998, pp. 124&ndash;39).</p>

<p>

Haji's authenticity condition, or some might say autonomy condition,
points to a different place than freedom or control where determinism
could pose a threat to morally responsible agency. On Haji's view,
manipulation cases do not threaten moral responsibility by threatening
free will. As regards free will or control, Haji's position is
internalist. Rather, manipulation cases threaten moral responsibility
by threatening an agent's authenticity as an evaluator of what courses
of action and way of life are valuable or worth pursuing. Hence, Haji's
historicism is designed to fight manipulators that artificially craft
an agent's framework of values.</p>

<p>

According to Haji, authentic as opposed to inauthentic evaluative
schemes arise through means that facilitate an agent's ability to
evaluate or assess them, and especially, allow her freedom not to act
in accord with them. For example, the sweet child whose sweetness is
beat into her does not act from an authentic evaluative scheme, but
one forged with no regard to foster understanding or sensitivities
that allow maturation. Indeed, such forms of indoctrination retard the
capacity for self-evolution. Hence, Haji's historicism, as applied to
authenticity, is meant to rule out manipulation cases that implant an
agent's framework of evaluations in control subverting ways. But one
might wonder, in exactly the same way under consideration when
discussing Fischer and Ravizza's view above (section B.2), whether
Pereboom might be able to fashion his version of a manipulation
argument so that the manipulation would satisfy Haji's historical
conditions.  Couldn't a manipulator simply manipulate in a manner that
facilitated the relevant authenticity-friendly agential abilities? If
so, would this sort of case undermine an agent's status as a morally
responsible agent?</p>

<h3>D. Normative Standpoint Compatibilism</h3>

<p>

One powerful element in Strawsonian compatibilism concerns
Strawson's emphasis on the point of view of those in the moral
community holding agents morally responsible (see section 5.6). Hence,
Strawson emphasizes the morally <em>reactive</em> attitudes. On one
interpretation of Strawson's position, the best case for compatibilism
begins from the vantage point of the reasons for holding and not
holding an agent morally responsible. This vantage point looks first to
the normally functioning interpersonal relationships of the members of
the moral community. These relationships give shape to the moral
expectations and demands within which a morally responsible agent must
operate. In its strongest form, this Strawsonian approach leads one to
regard with suspicion compatibilist efforts to capture free will by
starting with action theoretic features of agency, features involving
the springs of action (e.g., reasons-responsive mechanisms, or
hierarchical or other structural features involving elements of an
agent's psychology). This tactic moves <em>from</em> action theoretic
considerations <em>to</em> full accounts of morally responsible agency,
<em>and then</em> to the propriety conditions for others holding an
agent morally responsible. Given a certain Strawsonian orientation, the
proper strategy is to begin with the standpoint of the members of the
moral community holding an agent responsible. On this approach, the
debate is best cast as a normative one about the sorts of principles
that bear on when we should or should not treat a person as morally
responsible. From these normative questions, we can <em>then</em>
extrapolate what sort of action-theoretic characteristics are needed to
live up to these normative expectations. [Of course, this normative
standpoint strategy, <em>when developed in its strongest form</em>, is
specious. Why should it be assumed that if we begin by looking at the
standpoint of holding responsible, the philosophical controversy will
amount to a merely normative one? Might not that standpoint itself make
certain metaphysical presuppositions about the sorts of beings seen as
the appropriate objects of our normative demands? Furthermore, if the
legitimacy of the standpoint of holding responsible were itself
challenged, one quite natural way to defend it would be to argue that
it is designed to respond to beings of a certain sort. This would
naturally realign the order of priority, giving privilege back to
questions of agency.]</p>

<p>

R. Jay Wallace is the rightful heir to this Strawsonian strategy. In
his extremely influential <em>Responsibility and the Moral
Sentiments</em>, Wallace made this Strawsonian strategy his own,
supplementing it so as to avoid standard worries associated with
Strawson's formulation of compatibilism, and working towards an account
of compatibilism that requires only guidance and not regulative
control. Wallace gives structure to the morally reactive attitudes by
distinguishing them from other attitudes and emotions. According to
Wallace, a reactive attitude of resentment or moral indignation has as
its object a certain sort of belief. The belief involves the judgment
that a person has violated an obligation to which she should be held
(1994, pp. 33&ndash;40). [By giving an account of holding responsible in
terms of obligations, Wallace puts a Kantian spin on his account. For
an alternative Humean approach to Strawsonian compatibilism, see Paul
Russell's excellent <em>Freedom and Moral Sentiment</em> (1995).] To
hold an agent morally responsible (and blameworthy) for some bit of
conduct is to respond to her (or to believe that it would be
appropriate to respond to her) with the morally reactive emotion of
resentment or moral indignation.</p>

<p>

Wallace's approach gives content to the morally reactive attitudes,
thereby showing how they can be subject to critical evaluation by
objective standards. If, for instance, it turns out that the belief
serving as a basis for a morally reactive attitude is false&mdash;that is,
if the person in question did not in point of fact violate the
obligation in question&mdash;then the rational basis for the attitude is
shown to be undercut. Hence, the attitude should be forsworn. Given
this explication of the morally reactive attitudes, Wallace next turns
to the Strawsonian question of when excuses or exemptions are
appropriate. [Excuses involve specific pleas that one is not
responsible for some bit of conduct, such as, &ldquo;I did not see you
there.&rdquo; Exemptions involve pleas that a person is not competent
to function as a morally responsible agent, such as, &ldquo;She did not
understand what she was doing. She is severely mentally ill.&rdquo;]
According to Wallace, that question turns upon two others. In the case
of excuses, the question turns upon whether the agent in fact
<em>did</em> violate the obligation to which others hold her (1994, pp.
118&ndash;53). In the case of exemptions, the question turns upon whether the
agent possesses the general capacities to understand and act upon the
moral demands placed on her by such obligations (1994, pp. 154&ndash;94). In
each case, Wallace maintains, it is a normative principle of fairness
that informs our excusing or exempting practices. In the case of
excusing practices, the principle is one of desert: One does not
deserve to be blamed for violating a moral obligation that she did not
violate. In the case of exempting practices, the principle is one of
moral reasonableness: It is unreasonable to demand of a person that she
comply with moral demands if she simply hasn't the capacities or
resources to do so.</p>

<p>

Wallace proceeds to argue that neither of these moral principles is
threatened by determinism. Determinism would not show that no one ever
violates moral obligations, nor would it show that everyone is
incapacitated to understand or comply with the demands involved in
moral obligations. Furthermore, as Wallace observes, excuses that
appear to generate the demand for alternative possibilities (and hence,
Garden of Forking Paths freedom and regulative control), such as, &ldquo;I
could not have done otherwise&rdquo;, are excuses that cannot be
generalized. They work, when they do, <em>only</em> by showing that an
agent did not violate a moral obligation in acting as she did (1994,
pp. 152&ndash;3). Factors other than her disregard for a moral obligation
explain her action (e.g., she was forced to do something at gunpoint,
or was physically unable to get to the emergency phone because her leg
was broken, etc.). So it seems that Wallace shares with Frankfurt and
Fischer the view that regulative control is not required for moral
responsibility; only guidance control is.</p>

<p>

But where does Wallace stand as regards manipulation cases and the
internalist versus externalist (snapshot versus historical properties)
approaches to free will and moral responsibility? In <em>Responsibility
and the Moral Sentiments</em> Wallace addresses manipulation cases
under the rubric of systematic behavior control or conditioning (1994,
p. 155). His principle for distinguishing those exempt from morally
responsible agency is informed exclusively by whether the persons in
question are incapacitated to understand and comply with the demands
of moral obligations. Therefore, it looks as if Wallace is committed
to an internalist position, and to treating moral responsibility as a
snapshot property. (However, Wallace himself never discusses the debate
in these terms.) To the extent that any internalist position is
susceptible to manipulation cases, it seems that Wallace's is too. It
looks as if Wallace must adopt the same style of response as
Frankfurt (discussed in section A above).</p>

<p>

Wallace approaches the free will issue from the normative standpoint
of moral philosophy, whereas a view like Frankfurt's or Fischer and
Ravizza's approaches the topic from the standpoints of metaphysics and
action theory. There appears to be a serious tension between the two
approaches, and Wallace openly considers this tension, arguing that
his is to be preferred to the other approach (1994, pp. 85&ndash;95). [This
contrast between metaphysical and normative might well be overdrawn.
For instance, on Fischer and Ravizza's view, a moderately
reasons-responsive mechanism must be receptive to at least some moral
reasons. Hence, &ldquo;normative&rdquo; considerations bleed into
their metaphysical account. Similarly, on Wallace's view, the
normative principles of fairness that inform our practices of holding
morally responsible concern persons. Hence, &ldquo;metaphysical&rdquo;
considerations bleed into his normative account.] But any tension of
methodology should not be too quickly associated with a tension in
outcomes. Perhaps a view like Wallace's might mesh with a view like
Frankfurt's or Fischer and Ravizza's, so that the same sort of
conditions of agency and responsibility apply in both cases. This
would suggest that the different approaches can actually work in
tandem, maybe because our normative principles of fairness informing
our moral responsibility practices track our metaphysical and
action-theoretical parsings.</p>

<h3>E. Practical Standpoint Compatibilism</h3>

<p>

Hilary Bok has advanced a form of compatibilism that shares certain
features with Daniel Dennett's. In particular, Bok, like Dennett (see
section 5.2), develops a viewpoint argument&mdash;or as she puts it, a
standpoint argument. Both maintain that a certain standpoint is a
legitimate one, and is the one whence judgments of responsibility
arise. Responsibility or freedom concepts at work within this
viewpoint, each argue, are compatibilist-friendly ones, unthreatened
by the possibility that determinism is true. Bok's account, however,
differs in various respects from Dennett's. Unlike Dennett, Bok
maintains that the relevant standpoint arises by distinguishing, in
Kantian fashion, between the practical and the theoretical points of
view. The former standpoint has as its goal answering questions about
how one ought to act. The latter concerns truthfully describing and
explaining events as necessary results of antecedent conditions (1998,
pp. 62&ndash;5). It is Bok's contention that, while both libertarian notions
of free will and compatibilist notions of free will <em>are</em> found
within the range of the &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; concept of freedom, the
one that matters as regards the free will debate is the one that a
practical agent would have good reason to adopt (1998, p. 100). It is
not that one, so to speak, captures the &ldquo;real&rdquo; truth about
what the concept of free will is. It's that one is useful to agency in
a way that the other is not. Hence, Bok seeks to settle the free will
problem by looking at the role of the concept of freedom from the
point of view of a practical deliberator engaged in settling questions
regarding how to act, how to live her life, what kind of person she
wishes to be, etc.</p>

<p>

Given her practical standpoint approach, Bok maintains that the sort
of freedom that is of use to practical deliberators concerns
possibilities restricted in scope to those consistent with what an
agent understands to be practically possible from her limited epistemic
perspective (1998, p. 108). These possibilities are much looser than
the sort required by libertarian free will, the latter requiring
attention only to possibilities given a precisely specified past and
holding fixed the actual laws of nature. Bok's favored possibilities
allow an agent to reason about alternative courses of action
conditional upon her choosing in one manner as opposed to another.
Hence, Bok embraces a conditional analysis of free will. Naturally for
Bok, for an alternative to be genuine, it need not be open given
precisely the same past and laws of nature. It need only be genuine
given the coarser facts about the conditional relation between an
agent's will and subsequent conduct likely to arise from it. If she
chooses in one fashion, then a certain course of action will come to
fruition; if she chooses in another, then another course of action will
come to fruition (1998, p. 120).</p>

<p>

So Bok embraces regulative control in order to capture the
freedom-relevant condition for moral responsibility. Her appeal to a
conditional analysis of regulative control, however, leaves her open
to the same sort of criticism leveled against the classical
compatibilist's conditional analysis (see 3.3 above). On her view, an
agent who does <em>y</em> and not <em>x</em> has free will with
respect to the alternative course of action <em>x</em> if the
following is true: If she chose to <em>x</em>, then she
would <em>x</em>. But classical compatibilists faced a troubling sort
of example that seemed to disprove any such equivalence. A person
could lack free will with respect to a course of action since she
might suffer from a psychological condition that made it impossible
for her to choose that course of action <em>x</em>. All the same, it
would still be true that,
<em>if</em> she <em>did</em> choose the course of action <em>x</em>,
then she would <em>x</em>. Hence, the analysis generates the result
that an agent has free will in cases in which clearly she does not
(Ginet, 2003; Haji, 2002; and McKenna, 2002).</p>

<p>

It would, however, be unfair to dismiss Bok's practical standpoint
compatibilist theory simply because the particular account of freedom
she relies upon is suspect. It might be true that conditional analyses
are doomed to failure, but other treatments of agential possibility
remain. So perhaps Bok could defend some notion of regulative control
<em>sans</em> the classical compatibilists' conditional
analysis. Indeed, this is just what the new dispositionalists have
attempted to achieve (see section 5.1), and there is no reason that
Bok could not draw upon their proposal, one that embraces a
dispositionalist account of regulative control, but shuns a
conditional analysis of dispositions.  So Bok's position remains very
much alive despite any worries of the sort currently under
consideration.  The important philosophical point, on Bok's approach,
is that the demands of the practical standpoint invite a looser notion
of possibility than the sort that is at work when formulating precise
definitions of determinism, or when attempting to fashion libertarian
notions of free will. Some looser notion of agential possibility might
allow a compatibilist to say that all the possibility that is needed
for regulative control is something like epistemic possibility, i.e.,
&ldquo;for all I as a practical agent know&rdquo; possibility.</p>

<p>

So set aside the (legitimate) criticism that Bok's manner of
developing regulative control falls prey to the same sorts of
objections leveled against the classical compatibilist. Fix instead on
the strategic effort to show that the practical standpoint encourages
some looser notion of possibility than the sort relevant to
determinism. How does Bok justify the import of this compatibilist
notion of freedom? According to Bok, it is justified by our practical
interest in improving the qualities of our wills, which are
reflections of our selves, fashioners of the people we will become
(1998, pp.  123&ndash;66). We care, when we deliberate, to evaluate
possibilities in terms of how we acted in the past and how we might
improve our conduct and ourselves in the future. A compatibilist
notion of freedom will help us to do the work of improving our
characters and fashioning our selves. It will allow us to conceive of
what it is within our general range of capacities to do, and to
evaluate our options in terms which lead to our improvement.</p>

<p>

Bok's justification for a compatibilist-friendly notion of freedom is
surprisingly forward-looking. We care about the relevant notion of
freedom since we care about future improvements to our wills and
characters. This is in deep conflict with the spirit of approaches
(such as Strawson's) that have dismissed such consequentialist sorts
of justifications of free will as unable to capture the intimate
connection between an agent and her responsibility for what she has
done. For her regret or guilt to be a genuine expression of her
attitude towards her conduct and those whom she wronged, it had better
be a response to what she did in the past, and not merely a vehicle
for improving herself in the future. But set this sort of worry
aside. Another implication of Bok's forward looking account is that it
seems that she must accept an internalist view (Haji, 2002). If the
practical use of freedom is best understood as forward-looking, then
however an agent is caused to come into existence and have the
psychological structure she has, she can regard herself as free and
responsible insofar as doing so will aid in improving her will
somewhere down the pike. Bok, it seems, like Frankfurt and Wallace, is
an internalist.  If so, then in relevant sorts of manipulation cases
as they figure in a manipulation argument, Bok must resist premise
one, and contend that an agent manipulated into the relevant state, if
she is at the time fully equipped to apply her capacities for
practical reasoning, is free and morally responsible for what she
does.</p>

<h3>F. The Action Theory Theory</h3>

<p>

One classical compatibilist strategy that most contemporary
theorists seem to have overlooked is an austere one that attempts to
make do with as little as possible beyond more primitive features of
agency itself. The classical compatibilist used only blunt instruments
to fashion such a view (see section 3.1). All that she seemed to draw
upon in an account of agency was the notion of a desire or want, and
the negative condition that it be unimpeded. But despite her
impoverished resources in capturing the springs of action, her strategy
was a philosophically elegant one. Simply postulate no more than the
features giving rise to agency. These features need be no fancier than
the sort typically at play innormally functioning human persons.
There is little reason to imagine that determinism is incompatible with
such agency <em>simpliciter</em>. Next, to capture <em>freely
willed</em> agency, append some negative conditions that secure that
sometimes that basic sort of agency can function unhindered by coercive
or compulsive forces. Voil&agrave;, free will! Add no more metaphysical
constraints, nothing further to show how it gels with determinism.
Leave compatibilism at that; simple is better.</p>

<p>

In <em>Autonomous Agency</em>, Alfred Mele sketches a contemporary
form of compatibilism that shares with the classical compatibilist the
strategy of theoretical austerity: Capture free will by adding as
little as possible beyond an account of mere agency. [As one subject
editor pointed out, there might be a lot of metaphysical work loaded
into Mele's account of agency <em>simpliciter</em>, and it might be
that the controversial compatibilist details are found there and not
in any further metaphysical conditions (such as hierarchical accounts
of the will).]  Naturally, Mele draws upon a finely tuned set of
conceptual tools to capture more clearly the contours of the springs
of action. He makes use of philosophy's matured understanding of
action theory, an understanding to which he himself has
contributed. But he attempts to append to his account of agency as
little as possible in order to generate a form of compatibilism that
speaks to the contemporary dialectic. Given that the theory of
compatibilism that he advises attempts to build mostly from his work
on the theory of action, it might be called the <em>Action Theory
Theory</em>. (Mele himself is not a compatibilist. He remains agnostic
between compatibilists and incompatibilists, but offers each camp a
best shot at a workable theory.) On Mele's view, free will is where
the action is.</p>

<p>

Mele does not fashion compatibilism in terms of free will and
determinism, but instead in terms of <em>autonomy</em> and determinism.
But as Mele openly acknowledges, he understands autonomy to be amongst
the freedom concepts in discussions of moral responsibility (1995, p.
4). Mele understands autonomy, basically, as the capacity for
self-governance or self-rule, and he looks to more basic features of
self-control to explain the phenomena. <em>A word of caution</em>:
Mele's discussion of self-control should not be assimilated with the
notions of guidance or regulative control discussed by Fischer (and
used in this essay to distinguish different views of free will).
Fischer and others who make use of the notion of control as synonymous
with free will see the relevant notion of control as all that is needed
to satisfy the freedom-relevant condition for morally responsible
agency. But Mele does not presume that the notion of self-control he
wishes to distinguish can do that compatibilist work. Indeed, as will
become clear, Mele holds that the sort of self-control he wishes to
distinguish, while a genuine actional feature found in most normally
functioning agents, is not adequate to explain the kind of freedom at
issue in discussions of moral responsibility.</p>

<p>

What does Mele have in mind by a self-controlled agent? He has in
mind the opposite of an agent who is akratic, that is, an agent who is
weak-willed. Mele treats self-controlled and weakly-willed conduct as
two sides of the same coin (1995, p. 5). Hence, he draws upon his
account of weakness of will to help shed light on weak will's opposite,
self-control. According to Mele, weakness of will arises when one's
motivational states become misaligned with one's judgments about the
best (or better) course of action (1995, p. 7). Because, on Mele's
view, evaluations of things one desires can be out of line with the
strength of one's desires for those things, one's best judgments
sometimes are in disharmony with one's strongest desires (desires that
do appear to play a causal role in action) (1995, p. 25). It is in such
cases of conflict that the self-controlled as opposed to the weak
willed agent is able to resist acting upon her currently strongest
desire and instead act in accord with what she judges it best to do
(1995, p. 80). This is possible, on Mele's view, since agents with the
sort of sophistication of normally functioning persons are able to
promise themselves rewards for resisting temptation, or direct their
attention to less desirable features of the path more strongly desired,
and generally, exploit less episodic and more stable motivation to
exercise self-control. In so doing, they can bring their motivational
condition into line with their &ldquo;best judgments&rdquo; (1995, pp.
81&ndash;83).</p>

<p>

According to Mele, an agent can be both determined <em>and</em>
exercise the actional resources to act with self-control. Hence,
determinism is compatible with self-controlled agency. But it is Mele's
contention that even an optimally self-controlled agent can fall short
of autonomous agency (1995, pp. 121&ndash;7). Hence, Mele concludes that more
has to be added to his account of self-control to get all the way to
autonomous agency. Notice that, up until this point, Mele's theory
appeals only to features of agency at work in the theory of action.
These include such notions as best judgments, strongest desires,
intentions, the ability to promise oneself rewards, the distinction
between more and less episodic motivational factors, and questions
about the potential conflict between best judgment and motivational
desires.</p>

<p>

How is it that, on Mele's view, self-controlled agency is
<em>not</em> itself sufficient to capture autonomous agency? Because,
on Mele's view, the beliefs, values and principles that inform one's
deliberation and conduct might be installed in a person in some
autonomy (or responsibility) undermining manner. Such cases arise via
various sorts of manipulation, through brainwashing or hypnosis, or
even from a history of rigorous indoctrination during youth. The key
element in an agent's <em>not</em> having had, for instance,
unsheddable principles and values installed in an autonomy-undermining
manner is that the causal manner in which the agent acquired them
did <em>not</em> bypass an agent's critical capacities to assess the
principles and values for herself (1995, pp. 166&ndash;73). In such cases,
she had the opportunity to embrace or shed them. Hence, Mele
postulates a <em>negative historical constraint</em> on autonomous
agency: An agent acts autonomously if she acts with self-control, has
beliefs that foster deliberation, is able to deliberate effectively,
was not caused to endorse unsheddable values and
principles (against which she is able to evaluate her reasons for
action) by means that bypassed her capacities for critical evaluation
(1995, p.193).</p>

<p>

Another important feature of the compatibilist view Mele offers is
that, like Fischer and Ravizza's, it also eschews the demand for
regulative control. In fact, Mele, along with David Robb, coauthored
one of the most compelling defenses of Frankfurt examples in order to
demonstrate that moral responsibility, and also free will and
autonomous agency, do not require the freedom to do otherwise (Mele and
Robb, 1998). Hence Mele, like Frankfurt, Fischer, and Wallace, avoids
difficulties arising from incompatibilist attacks upon regulative
control, such as the one posed by the Consequence Argument (see section
4.1).</p>

<p>

Notice that Mele's view differs from Fischer and Ravizza's (see
Section B.2 above) in that Mele's historical constraint is a negative
one. Hence, Mele, unlike Fischer and Ravizza, offers no specific
account of what kind of causal history of owning one's springs of
action <em>is</em> required. Rather, Mele only states what kind of
history cannot give rise to autonomous (or freely willed) agency. One
important difference between Mele's historical view and Fischer and
Ravizza's is that the latter offer a positive account of the sort of
history that is required, which leads them to a subjectivist view. On
Fischer and Ravizza's subjectivist view, an agent is not morally
responsible for her conduct if she does not believe herself to be a
candidate for such evaluations. On Mele's view, an agent might fail to
have the relevant beliefs, and hence refuse to take responsibility for
what others would insist she should. But so long as the values and
principles that she does act upon did not arise through means that
bypassed her capacities to evaluate them, then she is autonomous with
respect to (and morally responsible for) the self-controlled actions
arising from them&mdash;no matter what her subjective view of her self
might be.</p>

<p>

In <em>Free Will and Luck</em> (2006) Mele revisited his 1995
compatibilist proposal, defending it against various critics, and
further amending it by considering it in light of a yet-more-refined
version of an incompatibilists' manipulation argument (which, as shall
be explained below, is more accurately described as a creation
argument). In an effort to discharge his first task, Mele revisits his
case of Ann and Beth (introduced above in section B.2).  Although the
case is a manipulation case, and so most likely thought to be of use
primarily to incompatibilists, Mele first introduced it, not to
develop an incompatibilist argument against compatibilism, but to
articulate his externalist, and so historical, compatibilist theory.
Both Ann and Beth possess at a certain time of action the same
intrinsic properties (roughly), and so are internal psychological
duplicates.  But if one (Ann) acts freely and is morally responsible
and the other (Beth) is not, it is only history that could explain the
difference.  And so, Mele contends, compatibilists should be
externalists and opt for a historical requirement, which, as just
explained, for Mele is a negative one.  An agent must not have
acquired her values and principles (and then be forced to sustain
them) by means that bypassed her ability to evaluate them.  Ann did
not acquire her values and principles in this way; Beth did.  In his
more recent book, Mele takes on Daniel Dennett (2003), Nomy Arpaly
(2003), and Tomis Kapitan (2000), each of whom press Mele by
contending either that we can understand cases like Beth's in such a way
that her lack of responsibility is due to some non-historical fact
about her when she acts, and not her history (Dennett's move), or
instead, that Beth is free and morally responsible if Ann is (Arpaly's
move), or that there are other cases of manipulation whereby an agent
satisfies Mele's proposed compatibilist sufficient conditions for
moral responsibility, and yet the agent is not free and responsible
(Kapitan's move).  In each case, Mele defends his original
proposal. (I'll not set out the details here.)</p>

<p>

One especially fruitful upshot of Mele's reply to his previous critics
comes in Mele's response to Kapitan (Mele, 2006, pp.184&ndash;95). Kapitan
was worried about a manipulation case in which an agent was
manipulated (or rather created) at a deterministic universe to act at
a certain time, but yet none of her values and principles are acquired
by her in ways that undermine her (compatibilist) ability to
critically evaluate them.  In such a case, the agent would satisfy
Mele's proposed compatibilist sufficient conditions, and yet,
Kapitan's worry seemed to be that we should think such an agent is not
free or morally responsible when she acts at the crucial time.  [What
Kapitan had in mind, it seems, is that the compatibilist would then
not be able to deny premise 2 of the manipulation argument (as set out
above in the introduction).]  In the course of replying to Kapitan,
Mele introduced a new argument for incompatibilism, <em>the zygote
argument</em>, and used it so as to help clarify just what is involved
in a commitment to compatibilism of the sort Mele has proposed.  Very
briefly, the argument begins with an example, not of
manipulating an already existing agent, but of creating an agent &ldquo;in
utero,&rdquo; as Mele puts it (2006, p.188).  So, at a determined world, the
goddess Diana creates a zygote that, thirty years later is (or
becomes) Ernie, and performs some act, which was just the act that
Diana intended that Ernie perform at the precise time he did.  Bernie
is just like Ernie, but lived out his life through a normal
deterministic process and acts just like Ernie at the relevant time.
Now, Mele asks, can a compatibilist consistently contend that Bernie
is free and morally responsible when he acts while holding that Ernie
is not?  With this question in mind, Mele formulates the zygote
argument for incompatibilism (2006, p.189).  Roughly, the argument
goes as follows: 1) Because of how Ernie's zygote was formed, he is
not free and morally responsible when he acts; 2) There is no relevant
difference between how Ernie comes into existence and how an agent at
a determined world (like Bernie) comes into existence; therefore, 3)
determinism rules out free and morally responsible action.</p>

<p>

Mele ultimately suggests that if the compatibilist is to resist this
argument, she must resist the first premise and not the second.
Hence, as Mele makes clear, externalism about freedom and moral
responsibility will not guarantee the historical compatibilist a way
to claim that in all &ldquo;global&rdquo; manipulation cases (if we
can think of a creation case as an extreme manipulation case), the
agent is not free and responsible.  The historical compatibilist, of
either Fischer and Ravizza's or Mele's stripe, will sometimes have to
resist premise one rather than premise two (as set out in the
introductory section, and as formulated in Mele's zygote argument) of
a well crafted manipulation argument.  Mele's zygote argument has
rightly received a considerable amount of attention, as it seems to
zero in on just the core thought driving the many other attempts to
develop a manipulation argument.  In fact, one might think that Mele's
case of Ernie is very much like the agent in Pereboom's Case 2
(discussed above in the introduction).  What Mele has done is
articulate in a more precise way how an agent could be manipulated (or
created) by a team of programmers (or a goddess) to move through a
compatibilist-friendly history that is freedom and responsibility
facilitating and eventually come to perform what a compatibilist would
contend is a free act for which she is morally responsible.  Of course
Pereboom contends that such an agent is not free and responsible, and
Mele also points out that this also is just what an incompatibilist
would say.  Regardless, the salient point is that the compatibilist is
forced to accept what seems to be a counter-intuitive result: that
agents so manipulated, or created, are nevertheless free and morally
responsible.  It is then the compatibilists' burden to carry this
weight and explain why it is worth the cost to carry it.</p>

<p>

A good deal more could be said in an effort to explain the sort of
compatibilism Mele suggests, but one of the more provocative and
distinctive elements in his account is his strategic return to the
austerity of the classical compatibilists. The Action Theory Theory
gets a lot of mileage just out of action theory. It is an elegant
philosophical maneuver and merits more serious attention than it has
received up to this point.</p>

<h3>G. Further Avenues to Explore</h3>

<p>

In closing, here are several other interesting avenues currently worth exploring.</p>

<h4>G.1 Judgment-Sensitivity and Non-Voluntarism</h4>

<p>Ever since Robert Adams published his famous 1985 paper,
&ldquo;Involuntary Sins,&rdquo; some have been convinced that moral
responsibility does not require free will or free action since it does
not even require anything voluntary at all.  According to Adams, a
person might, for example, be responsible merely for entertaining
racist thoughts, or possessing an objectionable character
trait. Adams's thesis, while intriguing, was not developed in the
context of a full theory of moral responsibility, and perhaps partly
for this reason was hard to assess.  But in more recent times,
theories of moral responsibility have been developed that explain how
and why it is that a person might be morally responsible&mdash;and so
praiseworthy or blameworthy&mdash;for things over which she did not
exercise any voluntary control.  Most notable here is T.M. Scanlon,
who accounts for an agent's moral responsibility in terms of what is
revealed about her judgment-sensitivity (1998, and 2008).  Scanlon
does not fix attention on the non-voluntary, but it is clear that the
resources that he uses to account for moral responsibility for action
(in at least one of the two senses that he distinguishes) provide
sufficient conditions for an agent's being morally responsible for
non-voluntary matters as well, such as unbidden racist thoughts, or
lack of proper regard for those one loves.  Here, Angela Smith (2005)
has done much to develop this Scanlonian theme, and has explicitly
argued for moral responsibility for non-voluntary elements of a person
that reflect her sensitivity to moral considerations.  Naturally, it
becomes easier to see how to make moral responsibility compatible with
determinism if there is no requirement on moral responsibility that an
agent act with any free will at all.  So as not to mislead, it should
be pointed out that in the case of action, judgment-sensitivity
theorists are inclined to require a kind of freedom, but one that
simply shows that, in acting, an agent reveals her sensitivity to
moral considerations.  An agent who is not free because shoved, or
because suffering from an irresistible compulsive desire, is one whose
behavior is not linked to her sensitivity to moral judgments, as she
would act in these ways irrespective of her judgments.</p>

<h4>G.2 Compatibilism &amp; Revisionism</h4>

<p>

J.J.C. Smart (1963) famously bifurcated the free will debate, denying
the notion of moral responsibility built on the concept of desert (one
seemingly incompatible with determinism), and in doing so dismissing
the traditional free will problem.  But Smart unabashedly proposed a
revision of our ordinary concept of moral responsibility along the
lines of utilitarian considerations of influenceability. Our common
notion of moral responsibility and freedom might be no good, but Smart
insisted that a better one should simply be taken on, one that can be
assessed in terms of social utility.  Smart's appeal to utilitarian
considerations alone did not cut much ice with many other philosophers
(such as Strawson, 1963).  But there might well be other ways to
cultivate a revisionist program in ways that are broadly friendly to
the overall compatibilist project.  To this end, Manuel Vargas (e.g.,
in 2005, 2008, and Fischer, et al. 2007) has argued that our ordinary
concept of moral responsibility, and the freedom required of it, is
incompatibilist, but also unsatisfiable at this world.  Nevertheless,
we could reject this concept and instead build a revised concept of
freedom and responsibility that lives up to our normative demands
(unlike Smart's utilitarian proposal) and is naturalistically
plausible (unlike libertarian theories of free agency).  Vargas's
revisionist compatibilism offers an especially intriguing option in
light of some evidence from recent work by experimental philosophers
indicating that our concept of moral responsibility might have some
elements that pull in the direction of compatibilism, and others that
pull in the direction of incompatibilism. (To appreciate the
controversy over how we really should take the folk notion(s) of
freedom and responsibility, see, e.g., Nichols, 2006; Nahmias, Morris,
Nadelhoffer, and Turner, 2006; and Roskies and Nichols, 2008).</p>

<h4>G.3 Orthonomy: Freedom in Belief and Desire</h4>

<p>

Phillip Pettit and Michael Smith (in, e.g., 1996) argue that we can
account for the freedom bearing on moral responsibility in terms of
orthonomy&mdash;right rule.  An agent who is orthonomous is able to
recognize standards of right belief and right desire and then adjust
their beliefs and desires in the light of pertinent norms.  The
standards for sensitivity to the norms will involve some that are of a
conversational nature (see especially Pettit, 2001).  To believe
rightly is in part to be prepared to be swayed by the good evidence
other believers might make available.  So too for desiring rightly.
Others have also developed similar accounts of moral responsibility
and freedom (or self-control), all of which are regarded to be
compatible with determinism (e.g., Kennett's common sense defense of
self-controlled agency, 2001).  One interesting question for these
views is how much overlap they share with a reasons-responsive view,
such as Fischer and Ravizza's (discussed in section B above).
Suppose, for instance, Pettit is right to contend that the crucial
freedom for moral responsibility requires discursive control in one's
dealings with other persons, and suppose that in fact this does reach
beyond anything Fischer and Ravizza explicitly say; it might
nevertheless be that the two theses are easily conjoined, and that
Fischer and Ravizza's project really offers the right sort of
metaphysical anchor for a proposal like Pettit's.</p>

<h4>G.4 Contractualism and Compatibilism</h4>

<p>

Turning to the moral theory of contractualism brings us back to the
important work of T.M. Scanlon (1998, and 2008), wherein Scanlon draws
upon his general commitments in moral theory to account for the
warrantability of our judgments of moral responsibility.  Very
roughly, according to Scanlon, one kind of moral responsibility&mdash;of
the sort whereby we hold each other accountable&mdash;is to be explained
and justified by appeal to principles that one could not reasonably
reject, were she to be prepared to consider a contract for mutual
cooperation in our social relations.  The core compatibilist move here
for Scanlon is that the truth of determinism would have no bearing on
rational agents' grounds for accepting the relevant principles,
including the sorts of sanctions involved in blaming behavior in those
cases in which agents fail to live up to standards
that it would not be reasonable to reject.  Others have pursued a
contractualist proposal along other lines (e.g., Lenman, 2006), and it
is fair to say that a contractualist approaches the puzzle of the
relation between moral responsibility and determinism in a way that
seems largely to neuter the traditional action-theoretic worries most
working on the free will problem take to be central.</p>

<h4>G.5 Compatibilism without Desert: Wimpy or just Modest?</h4>

<p>

The hard incompatibilist Derk Pereboom argues that the really
important sort of moral responsibility, the sort that has been at
issue in the traditional free will debate, is the basic desert
entailing kind.  It is the kind according to which the wrongdoer who
freely does wrong deserves to be blamed just because she has done
wrong, and not for any other reason (such as a utilitarian or
contractualist sort of reason) (Pereboom, 2001, and Fischer, et. al.,
2007).  But Pereboom contends that various non-desert entailing kinds
of moral responsibility&mdash;for the moment let us call them
&ldquo;wimpy&rdquo; ones&mdash;are ones he would be prepared to say are
compatible with determinism.  [In Pereboom, 2007 (p.86), he explicitly
mentions Bok's view, though various other compatibilists have openly
argued for a version of compatibilism that is decoupled from
considerations of basic desert, such as Wallace (1994), and Scanlon
(1998).] So, for instance, if when a person did wrong and was, in
compatibilist terms, acting from reasons-responsive springs, then it
might well be right to engage her morally, to express our moral ill
will, to make demands of her, and so on.  Furthermore, such determined
agents could be ones we could still love and respect, they could be
liable to being influenced by the threat of punishment, and it would
be reasonable to alter our emotional relations with them in ways that
befit their having purposely harmed or benefited us.  Now, some might
contend that these wimpy resources are still rich enough to justify
judgments of moral responsibility, and are, furthermore, readily shown
to be compatible with determinism.  An especially pressing question
here is how much practical difference there would be between the
desert-entailing kind of freedom and responsibility that Pereboom and
other incompatibilists allege are incompatible with determinism, and
the sort that Pereboom is prepared to treat in compatibilist fashion
at a determined world.  The person who blames from a desert entailing
sort of moral responsibility might do no more in responding to a
wrongdoer than shun her as a means of blaming her.  And this is
something the person who blames in the non-desert entailing way might
do as well.  Here there would be no difference in treatment at all,
the only difference being in underlying justification and rationale.
Wimpy compatibilism might be compatibilism enough, and if it is, then
Pereboom, qua wimpy compatibilist, would be able to get nearly
everything he contends cannot be gotten from a non-wimpy version.  So,
will wimpy do?  One thing those who remain undecided should take care
to guard against is being seduced into plumping for the tough standard
(the basic desert entailing sort of moral responsibility) merely
because the other is characterized as wimpy.  The real question should
simply be about reasonable and adequate resources for rationally
justifying our attributions of freedom and responsibility.  Maybe
&ldquo;wimpy compatibilism&rdquo; is just &ldquo;modest
compatibilism&rdquo; by another name.</p>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Generalized quantifiers are now standard equipment in the toolboxes of
both logicians and linguists. The purpose of this entry is to describe
these tools: where they come from, how they work, and what they can be
used to do. The description is by necessity sketchy, but several more
comprehensive surveys exist in the literature and will be referred to
when appropriate. To fully appreciate the text below, basic
familiarity with elementary set theoretic terminology, and with the
language of first-order logic will be helpful.</p>

<h2 id="Prel">1. Preliminaries</h2>

<p>
The term &ldquo;generalized quantifier&rdquo; reflects that these
entities were introduced in logic as generalizations of the standard
quantifiers of modern logic, \(\forall\) and
 \(\exists\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 In retrospect one may say that \(\forall\) and \(\exists\) have been
found to be just two instances of a much more general concept of
quantifier, making the term &ldquo;generalized&rdquo; superfluous.
Today it is also common to use just &ldquo;quantifier&rdquo; for the
general notion, but &ldquo;generalized quantifier&rdquo; is still
frequent for historical reasons. This article employs both terms, with
a tendency to insert &ldquo;generalized&rdquo; in logical contexts,
and to drop it in linguistic contexts.</p>

<p>
We distinguish <em>quantifier expressions</em> from what they signify
or denote, the (generalized) quantifiers themselves. In logical
languages, quantifier expressions are variable-binding operators.
Thus, \(\exists\) is the familiar operator such that in a formula
\(\exists
 x\f\),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 \(\exists x\) binds all free occurrences of <i>x</i> in \(\f\). It
signifies the quantifier &ldquo;there exists&rdquo;&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
see shortly exactly what this object is. Likewise, the symbol \(Q_0\)
is often used as a variable-binding operator signifying &ldquo;there
exist infinitely many&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In natural languages a variety of expressions have been seen as
quantifier expressions, for example, each of the following English
expressions: </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<span class="fw smaller">everything, nothing, three books, the ten
professors, John, John and Mary, only John, firemen, every, at least
five, most, all but ten, less than half of the, John&rsquo;s, some
student&rsquo;s, no&hellip;except Mary, more male than female,
usually, never, each
 other</span>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 </div>

<p>
What, then, are generalized quantifiers? Before answering that
question, a brief historical prelude is helpful.</p>

<h2 id="Aris">2. Aristotle</h2>

<p>
Aristotle&rsquo;s syllogistics can be seen as a formal study of the
meaning of the four basic quantifier expressions <span class="fw smaller">all,
no, some, not all</span>, and of their properties. For
example, the validity, according to Aristotle, of the syllogism</p>

<div class="figure" style="margin-bottom: 10px">

<div style="display: table">
<span style="display: table-row" class="fw smaller">all(A,B)</span>
<span style="display: table-row" class="fw smaller">all(B,C)</span>

<hr style="border-color: black; padding:0; margin:0" />
<span style="display: table-row" class="fw smaller">some(A,C)</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>
shows that he considered, in contrast with modern logical usage, <span class="fw smaller">all</span>
to have <em>existential import</em>, so
that <span class="fw smaller">All A are B</span> entails that <span class="fw smaller">A</span>
is not an empty term. Likewise, the
validity of the syllogism</p>

<div class="figure" style="margin-bottom: 10px" id="fig-syll2">

<div style="display: table">
<span style="display: table-row" class="fw smaller">some(A,B)</span>
<span style="display: table-row" class="fw smaller">all(B,C)</span>

<hr style="border-color: black;padding:0;margin:0" />
<span style="display: table-row" class="fw smaller">all(A,C)</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>
expresses that <span class="fw smaller">some</span> is <em>monotone
increasing</em> (as we now put it) in the second argument. Each valid
syllogism formalizes part of the meaning of these quantifier
expressions, but Aristotle&rsquo;s study of their properties went
beyond the syllogistics. He observed, for example, that <span class="fw smaller">some</span>
and <span class="fw smaller">no</span>
are <em>convertible</em> or, as we might now say, <em>symmetric</em>,
since they satisfy the scheme</p>

<div class="figure" style="margin-bottom: 10px">

<div style="display: table">
<span style="display: table-row" class="fw smaller">Q(A,B)</span>

<hr style="border-color: black;padding:0;margin:0" />
<span style="display: table-row" class="fw smaller">Q(B,A)</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>
in contrast with <span class="fw smaller">all</span> and <span class="fw smaller">not
all</span>. Further, he studied how various
forms of <em>negation</em> combined with quantifier expressions in
(what was later called) the <em>square of
 opposition</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 Medieval logicians continued in Aristotle&rsquo;s tradition, but also
extended syllogistic reasoning to cases where <span class="fw smaller">A,B</span>
could themselves be quantified expressions, thus
dealing with premises and conclusions like <span class="fw smaller">Some
donkey of every man doesn&rsquo;t run</span> (example
from John Buridan, 14th century). Even though Aristotelian logic falls
short of the expressivity and precision of modern logic, the
syllogistics certainly was a decisive contribution to the study of
quantification. In fact, syllogistic systems of various expressive
power have recently been studied in mathematical logic, precisely
because of their affinity to natural reasoning and their simple
computational properties; see
 <a href="#QuanCogn">section 18</a>
 below.</p>

<p>
Especially interesting in the present context is the fact that these
quantifier expressions take <em>two</em> arguments or terms, and thus
can be seen as <em>binary relations</em>, both syntactically (as
Aristotle no doubt saw them) and semantically: given that terms
signify sets of individuals, the expression <span class="fw smaller">some</span>
can be taken to signify the relation of overlap,
i.e., of having non-empty intersection, between two sets, and <span class="fw smaller">all</span>
signifies the inclusion relation. Note
that these are not relations between individuals but between sets of
individuals&mdash;<em>second-order</em> relations. Indeed, they are
exactly the generalized quantifiers <em>some</em> and <em>all</em>,
respectively (on a given universe).</p>

<p>
This thread&mdash;that quantifier expressions signify second-order
relations&mdash;was not picked up by any of Aristotle&rsquo;s medieval
followers (as far as we know). Instead, they picked up on the fact
that the two terms have different status: the first combines with the
quantifier expression to form a noun phrase (as we now say), which is
the <em>subject</em> of the sentence, whereas the second is a verb
phrase constituting the <em>predicate</em>. This led them to focus on
what the subject&mdash;<span class="fw smaller">all men</span>, <span class="fw smaller">some
dogs</span>, <span class="fw smaller">no
sailors</span>&mdash;signified, which conceptually seems to be a
harder question. One might surmise that <span class="fw smaller">all
men</span> signifies every man (or the set of men), and that <span class="fw smaller">some
dogs</span> signifies some particular dog, but
what about <span class="fw smaller">no sailors</span>? In fact, one
can show that approaches like these are doomed to
 failure.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 The modern &ldquo;solution&rdquo; is that noun phrases signify
<em>sets of sets</em> of individuals, so that, for example <span class="fw smaller">some
dogs</span> signifies the set of sets
containing at least one dog&mdash;but that appears to require a more
abstract and mathematical approach to semantics than the idea, which
is at least implicit in Aristotle, that quantifier phrases signify
relations between (the denotations of) terms.</p>

<h2 id="Freg">3. Frege</h2>

<p>
The second major historical contribution to the theory of generalized
quantifiers came from the &ldquo;inventor&rdquo; of modern logic,
Gottlob Frege, in the 1870s. In fact, Frege&rsquo;s contribution is
twofold. As every philosophy student knows, he introduced the language
of predicate logic, with sentential connectives, identity, and the
variable-binding operator \(\forall\) (though his 2-dimensional
logical notation is no longer used). These are the quantifiers that
logicians during the 1950&rsquo;s began to &ldquo;generalize&rdquo;.
But Frege also explicitly formulated the abstract notion of a
quantifier as a second-order relation, or, as he called it, a
<em>second level concept</em> (&ldquo;<em>Begriff zweiter
Stufe</em>&rdquo;). He was well aware that the four Aristotelian
quantifiers were prime examples, but he wanted to avoid the focus on
subject-predicate form, which he (with much justification) saw as
having been a major obstacle to the development of logic after
Aristotle. It was therefore an important discovery that these
quantifiers could all be defined in terms of \(\forall\) and
sentential operators (replacing <span class="fw smaller">all</span>\((A,B)\)
by \(\forall x(A(x) \rightarrow B(x)\)),
<span class="fw smaller">some</span>\((A,B)\) by \(\neg\forall x(A(x)
\rightarrow \neg B(x)\)), etc.).</p>

<p>
In fact, the only significant difference between Frege&rsquo;s notion
of a second-level concept and the modern notion of a generalized
quantifier is that Frege did not have the idea of an
<em>interpretation</em> or <em>model</em>, which we now (since the
advent of model theory in the 1950s) see as a <em>universe</em> that
the quantifiers range over, plus an assignment of suitable semantic
objects to the non-logical symbols. Frege&rsquo;s symbols all had
fixed meanings, and the only universe he considered was the totality
of everything. But apart from this, one may well say that it was Frege
who discovered generalized quantifiers. This aspect of Frege&rsquo;s
logic, however, remained in the background for a long time, and model
theorists in the 50s and 60s seem not to have been aware of it.</p>

<h2 id="GeneUnivExisQuan">4. Generalizing the Universal and Existential Quantifier</h2>

<p>
Modern predicate logic fixes the meaning of \(\forall\) and
\(\exists\) with the respective clauses in the truth definition, which
specifies inductively the conditions under which a formula
\(\f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) (with at most \(x_1,\ldots,x_n\) free) is
<em>satisfied</em> by corresponding elements \(a_1,\ldots,a_n\) in a
model \(\M = (M,I)\) (where <i>M</i> is the universe and <i>I</i> the
interpretation function assigning suitable extensions to non-logical
symbols): \(\M \models \f(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\). The clauses are (where
&ldquo;iff&rdquo; as usual stands for &ldquo;if and only
if&rdquo;)</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li id="ex-all"><span class="tag">(1)</span><span class="sen"> \(\M
\models \forall x\p(x,a_1,\ldots,a_n)\) iff for each \(a\in M\), \(\M
\models \p(a,a_1,\ldots,a_n)\)</span></li>

<li id="ex-some"><span class="tag">(2)</span><span class="sen"> \(\M
\models \exists x\p(x,a_1,\ldots,a_n)\) iff there is some \(a\in M\)
s.t. \(\M \models \p(a,a_1,\ldots,a_n)\)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
To introduce other quantifiers, one needs to appreciate what kind of
expressions \(\forall\) and \(\exists\) are. Syntactically, they are
operators binding one variable in one formula. To see how they work
semantically it is useful to rewrite
 <a href="#ex-all">(1)</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex-some">(2)</a>
 slightly. First, every formula \(\p(x)\) with one free variable
denotes in a model \(\M\) a subset of <i>M</i>; the set of individuals
in <i>M</i> satisfying \(\p(x)\). More generally, if
\(\p(x,x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \p(x,\xbar)\) has at most the free variables
shown and \(\abar = a_1,\ldots,a_n\) are elements of <i>M</i>, let</p>

 \[\p(x,\abar)^{\M,x} = \{a\in M: \M \models \p(a,\abar)\}\]

<p>
be the <em>extension</em> of \(\p(x,\xbar)\) in \(\M\) relative to
\(a_1,\ldots,a_n\). Then we can reformulate
 <a href="#ex-all">(1)</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex-some">(2)</a>
 as follows:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li id="ex-all2"><span class="tag">(3)</span><span class="sen">\(\M
\models \forall x\p(x,\abar)\) iff \(\p(x,\abar)^{\M,x} =
M\)</span></li>

<li id="ex-some2"><span class="tag">(4)</span><span class="sen">\(\M
\models \exists x\p(x,\abar)\) iff \(\p(x,\abar)^{\M,x}
\neq\emp\)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, the conditions on the right hand side emerge as <em>properties
of the sets</em> \(\p(x,\abar)\). In fact, we can think of \(\forall\)
and \(\exists\) as denoting these properties, i.e., the property of
being identical to the universe, and of being non-empty, respectively.
And now it is easy to think of other properties of sets that can also
be treated as quantifiers, for example, the property of containing at
least 5, or exactly 3, elements, or of being
 infinite.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Note that these properties depend only on the universe <i>M</i>, not
on the rest of the model. Extensionally, they are simply sets of
subsets of <i>M</i>. This leads to the following definition.
essentially from <span class="citation">Mostowski (1957)</span>:</p>

 \[\tag{i}
\M \models Q x\p(x,\abar) \text{ iff } \p(x,\abar)^{\M,x} \in Q_M
\]

 </span></span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Here we use the same symbol for the quantifier expression and the
mapping that it signifies or denotes. Thus, \(\forall\) is now taken
to denote the universal quantifier, also written \(\forall\), which is
the mapping given by </p> 

 \[\forall_M = \{M\}\]

<p>
for all <i>M</i>. Similarly, \(\exists\) denotes the mapping defined
by</p> 

 \[\exists_M = \{A\subseteq M: A\neq\emp\}\]

<p>
And here are some other generalized quantifiers:</p> <!-- qlist1 -->

\[\tag{6}\label{ex-qlist1}
\begin{alignat}{2}
(\exists_{\geq 5})_M &amp; = \{A\subseteq M: |A| \geq 5\}  &amp; 
(|X| \textrm{ is the size or}\\
&amp;&amp;  \textrm{cardinality of } X) \\
(\exists_{= 3})_M &amp; = \{A\subseteq M: |A|= 3\}\\
(Q_0)_M &amp; = \{A\subseteq M: A \text{ is infinite}\}\\
(Q^R)_M &amp; = \{A\subseteq M: |A| &gt; |M-A|\} &amp; \textrm{ (the &ldquo;Rescher}\\
&amp;&amp; \textrm{quantifier&rdquo;)} \\
(Q_{\text{even}})_M &amp; = \{A\subseteq M: |A| \text{ is even}\}
\end{alignat}
\]

<p>
We now have a precise notion of a generalized quantifier, of which
\(\forall\) and \(\exists\) are instances, along with infinitely many
others. Moreover, we see how to extend first-order logic <em>FO</em>
to a logic \(\FO(Q)\), by adding the clause
 <a href="#ex-Qsyn">(5a)</a>
 to the formation rules, and the clause
 <a href="#ex-Qsem">(5b-i)</a>
 to the truth definition. Similarly if we add more than one
generalized quantifier: \(\FO(Q_1,\ldots,Q_n)\).</p>

<p>
In such a logic one may be a able to say things that are not
expressible in <em>FO</em>. For example, it is well-known that in
<em>FO</em> the notion of finiteness cannot be expressed. Thus there
is no way to say, of an ordering relation \(&lt;\), that each element
has only finitely many predecessors, for instance. But this is just
the sort of thing one can express in \(\FO(Q_0)\):</p> 

\[\tag{7}
\forall x \neg Q_0 y (y &lt; x)
\]

<p>
Likewise, one cannot say in <em>FO</em> that a (finite) set <i>A</i>
contains exactly half of the elements of the universe <i>M</i>, but
that is expressible in \(\FO(Q^R)\):</p> 

\[\tag{8}
\neg Q^RxA(x) \wedge \neg Q^Rx\neg A(x)
\]

<p>
(The first conjunct says that \(|A|\leq |M-A|\), and the second that
\(|M-A|\leq |A|\).)</p> <!-- [s:GQlog] -->

<h2 id="GeneQuanArbiType">5. Generalized Quantifiers of Arbitrary Types</h2>

<p>
Further generalization is possible. First, we can let <i>Q</i> bind
one variable in two or more formulas. Second, we can let it
simultaneously bind two or more variables in (some of) these formulas.
The <em>typing</em> of <i>Q</i> indicates this: <i>Q</i> is of type
\({\langle}n_1,\ldots,n_k{\rangle}\) (where each \(n_i\) is a natural
number \(\geq 1\)) if it applies to <i>k</i> formulas, and binds
\(n_i\) variables in the <i>i</i>th formula. This explains why the
quantifiers in the previous section were said to be of type
\({\langle}1{\rangle}\).</p>

<p>
In the general case, one normally chooses distinct variables
\(x_{i1},\)&hellip;,\(x_{in_i} = \xbar_i\) for \(1\leq i \leq k\), so
that a formula beginning with <i>Q</i> has the form</p> 

 \[
Q\xbar_1,\ldots,\xbar_k(\f_1,\ldots,\f_k)
\]

<p>
where all free occurrences of \(x_{i1},\ldots,x_{in_i} \) in \(\f_i\)
become bound. Now <i>Q</i> associates with each universe <i>M</i> a
<i>k</i>-ary relation \(Q_M\) between relations over <i>M</i>, where
the <i>i</i>th argument is an \(n_i\)-ary relation between
individuals. The corresponding clause in the truth definition
becomes</p> 

\[\tag{9}
\M\models Q\xbar_1,\ldots,\xbar_k (\p_1(\xbar_1,\abar),\ldots,\p_k(\xbar_k,\abar)) \textrm{ iff }\\
Q_M(\p_1(\xbar_1,\abar)^{\M,\xbar_1},\ldots,\p_k(\xbar_k,\abar)^{\M,\xbar_k})
\]

<p>
Here \(\p_i(\xbar_i,\ybar)\) is a formula with at most the free
variables shown, \(\abar\) is a sequence of elements of <i>M</i>
corresponding to \(\ybar\), and \(\p_i(\xbar_i,\abar)^{\M,\xbar_i}\)
is the extension of \(\p_i(\xbar_i,\ybar)\) in \(\M\) relative to
\(\abar\), i.e., the set of \(n_i\)-tuples \(\bbar_i\) such that
\(\M\models\p_i(\bbar_i,\abar)\).</p>

<p>
This is the official concept of a generalized quantifier in this
article. It was introduced by <span class="citation">Lindstr&ouml;m
(1966)</span>, and these quantifiers are sometimes called
&ldquo;Lindstr&ouml;m
 quantifiers&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 If we fix <i>M</i> to the universe containing
&ldquo;everything&rdquo;, we essentially have Frege&rsquo;s notion of
a second-level
 concept.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
<i>Q</i> is <em>monadic</em> if on each universe <i>M</i> it is a
relation between subsets of <i>M</i>, i.e., if its type is
\({\langle}1,\ldots,1{\rangle}\); otherwise it is <em>polyadic</em>.
For example, the Aristotelian quantifiers mentioned earlier are of
type
 \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\):<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>
 <!-- [qlist2] --> 

  \[\tag{10}\label{ex-qlist2}
  \begin{align}
\textit{all}_M(A,B) &amp; \iff A \subseteq B\\
\textit{some}_M(A,B) &amp; \iff A \cap B \neq\emp\\
\textit{no}_M(A,B) &amp; \iff A \cap B = \emp\\
  \textit{not all}_M(A,B) &amp; \iff A \not\subseteq B
  \end{align}
  \]

<p>
Here are some more type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) 
 quantifiers:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
</p>

\[\tag{11}\label{ex-qlist3}
\begin{alignat}{2}
(\textit{at least five})_M(A,B) &amp;\iff |A \cap B|\geq 5\\
(\textit{exactly three})_M(A,B) &amp;\iff |A \cap B|= 3\\
(\textit{infinitely many})_M(A,B) &amp;\iff A \cap B \text{ is infinite} \\
\textit{most}_M(A,B) &amp;\iff |A \cap B|&gt; |A-B| \\ 
(\textit{an even number of})_M(A,B) &amp;\iff |A \cap B|\text{ is even}\\
\textit{MO}_M(A,B) &amp;\iff |A| &gt; B|\\
\textit{I}_M(A,B) &amp;\iff |A| = |B| &amp; \textrm{ (the &ldquo;H&auml;rtig}\\ 
&amp;&amp;\textrm{quantifier&rdquo;)}
\end{alignat}
\]

<p>
With monadic quantifiers it is convenient to use just <em>one</em>
variable, and let <i>Q</i> bind that same variable in each of the
formulas. Thus, to say that most <i>A</i>s are not <i>B</i>, for
example, one may write</p> 

\[
\textit{most}\: x (A(x),\neg B(x))
\]

<p>
in the corresponding logical language, rather than \(\textit{most}\:
x,y (A(x),\neg B(y))\).</p>

<p>
Here are a few polyadic quantifiers:</p> <!-- qlist4 --> 

<div id="ex-qlist4">
\[\tag{12}\label{ex-qlist4}
\begin{alignat}{2}
W_M(R) &amp;\iff R \text{ is a well-ordering of } M  &amp;

(Q_0^n)_M(R) &amp; \iff \text{there is an infinite} \\
&amp; \hphantom{\iff\ } A\subseteq M \ST  A^n \subseteq R &amp; 
  \textrm{type } {\langle}n{\rangle}\\
Res^k(\textit{most})_M(R,S) &amp; \iff |R\cap S| &gt; |R-S| &amp; 
  \textrm{type } {\langle}k,k{\rangle}\\
\textit{RECIP}_M(A,R) &amp; \iff \textrm{for all distinct } a,b\in A \\
&amp;\hphantom{\iff\ } \textrm{ there is } n\geq 1 \\
&amp;\hphantom{\iff\ } \textrm{ and }  c_0,\ldots,c_n \ST  c_0 = a \\
&amp;\hphantom{\iff\ } {}  \amp c_n = b  \amp  c_iRc_{i+1} \textrm{ for } i &lt; 
 n\quad &amp; \textrm{type } {\langle}1,2{\rangle}

\]
</div>

<p>
<i>W</i> and \(Q_0^n\) come from logic and set theory.
\(Res^k(\textit{most})\) is the <em>resumption</em> of <em>most</em>
to <i>k</i>-tuples. Resumption can be applied to any quantifier (in
the syntax, this means replacing each individual variable by a
corresponding <i>k</i>-tuple of variables); it has logical uses but
also, like <em>RECIP</em>, uses in the interpretation of certain
sentences in natural languages; see
 <a href="#PolyNatuLangQuan">section 16</a>
 below.</p> <!-- [s:isom] -->

<h2 id="TopiNeut">6. Topic Neutrality</h2>

<p>
Both Mostowski and Lindstr&ouml;m had one additional condition in
their definitions of generalized quantifiers: they should not
distinguish isomorphic models. Informally, they are
&ldquo;topic-neutral&rdquo;: the truth of a statement of the form \(\f
= Qx,yz(A(x),R(y,z))\), say, in a model \(\M\) doesn&rsquo;t depend on
the particular individuals <i>M</i> consists of. If the individuals of
<i>M</i> are mapped in a one-one fashion onto the individuals of
another universe \(M'\), and if <i>A</i> and <i>R</i> are mapped
accordingly, one obtains an <em>isomorphic</em> model \(\M'\).
<em>Isomorphism Closure</em> then says that \(\M\models\f\) iff
\(\M'\models\f\).</p>

<p>
More formally, if \(\M = (M,I)\) and \(\M' = (M',I')\) are models for
the same vocabulary <i>V</i> of non-logical symbols, <i>f</i> is an
<em>isomorphism</em> from \(\M\) to \(\M'\), iff</p>

<ul>

<li><i>f</i> is a bijection (a one-one onto function) from <i>M</i> to
\(M'\);</li>

<li>whenever <i>P</i> is an <i>n</i>-ary predicate symbol in <i>V</i>
and \(a_1,\ldots,a_n \in M\), 

\[
(a_1,\ldots,a_n) \in I(P) \textrm{ iff } (f(a_1),\ldots,f(a_n)) \in I'(P);
\]

 </li>

<li>whenever <i>c</i> is an individual constant in <i>V</i>, \(I'(c) =
f(I(c))\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
\(\M\) and \(\M'\) are <em>isomorphic</em>, in symbols,</p>

\[\M \cong \M'\]

<p>
if there is an isomorphism from one to the other. Now if <i>Q</i> is a
generalized quantifier of type \({\langle}n_1,\ldots,n_k{\rangle}\),
\(P_i\) is an \(n_i\)-ary predicate symbol for \(1\leq i\leq k\), \(\M
= (M,I)\) is a model for the vocabulary \(\{P_1,\ldots,P_k\}\), and
\(R_i = I(P_i)\), we also write</p> 

\[\M = (M,R_1,\ldots,R_k)\]

<p>
Then <i>Q</i> satisfies <em>Isomorphism Closure</em>, or just <span class="sc">Isom</span>,
if the following holds:</p> <!-- [isom] -->

\[\tag{13}\label{ex-isom}
 \textrm{If } (M,R_1,\ldots,R_k) \cong (M',R'_1,\ldots,R'_k), \textrm{ then }\\
Q_M(R_1,\ldots,R_k) \Leftrightarrow Q_{M'}(R'_1,\ldots,R'_k).
\]

<p>
One easily checks that all the generalized quantifiers exemplified so
far are indeed <span class="sc">Isom</span>. We did not include this
requirement in the definition of generalized quantifiers however,
since there are natural language quantifiers that do not satisfy it;
see below. But logic is supposed to be topic-neutral, so <span class="sc">Isom</span>
is almost always imposed. Then two important
things follow. First, as indicated above, sentences in logical
languages do not distinguish isomorphic models. More precisely, we
have the following</p>

<div class="indent avoid-break">

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
<strong>Fact 2</strong></p>

<p style="margin-top:0;">
If \(L = \FO(Q_1,\ldots,Q_n)\), each \(Q_i\) is <span class="sc">Isom</span>,
\(\f\) is an <em>L-sentence</em>, and \(\M
\cong \M'\), then \(\M\models\f \Leftrightarrow \M'\models\f\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Second, <span class="sc">Isom</span> takes a particularly interesting
form for <em>monadic</em> quantifiers. If \(\M = (M,A_1,\ldots,A_k)\),
where \(A_i \subseteq M\) for each <i>i</i>, then \(A_1,\ldots,A_k\)
<em>partition</em> <i>M</i> into \(2^k\) pairwise disjoint subsets
(some of which may be empty); let us call them the <em>parts</em> of
\(\M\). We illustrate with \(k=2\) and \(\M = (M,A,B)\):</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="fig1.svg" alt="two intersecting circles inside a box (the box labeled 'M') with 'A intersecting B' labeling the circle intersection and 'A minus B' and 'B minus A' labeling the non-intersecting parts of the circles. The area inside the box but not in the circles is labeled 'M minus (A union B)'" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1</span></p>
</div>

<p>
Now it is not hard to see that only the <em>sizes of the parts</em>
determine whether two models of this kind are isomorphic or not:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
<strong>Fact 3</strong></p>

<p style="margin-top:0;text-align:left;">
\((M,A_1,\ldots,A_k) \cong (M',A'_1,\ldots,A'_k)\) iff the
cardinalities of the corresponding parts are the same.</p>
</div>

<p>
This shows that monadic and <span class="sc">Isom</span> generalized
quantifiers indeed deal only with <em>quantities</em>, i.e., with
<em>sizes</em> of sets rather than the sets themselves. The list
\eqref{ex-qlist3} of type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) generalized
quantifiers clearly illustrates this, but also the Aristotelian
quantifiers can be formulated in terms of cardinalities,</p>

\[
\begin{align}
\textit{all}_M(A,B) &amp; \iff |A-B|=0\\
\textit{some}_M(A,B) &amp; \iff |A \cap B|&gt;0
\end{align}
\]

<p>
etc., and similarly for the type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\) examples we
gave.</p>

<p>
More generally, under <span class="sc">Isom</span>, monadic
quantifiers can be seen as relations between (cardinal) numbers. For
example, if <i>Q</i> is of type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\), then define
(using the same symbol <i>Q</i> for the relation between numbers)</p>

\[ Q(\kappa,\lambda) \iff \text{there is } (M,A) \ST |M\!-\!A|=\kappa
\amp |A|=\lambda \amp Q_M(A) \]

<p>
<span class="sc">Isom</span> guarantees that this is well-defined, and
we have</p> 

\[
Q_M(A) \iff Q(|M\!-\!A|,|A|)
\]

 <!-- [s:rel] -->

<h2 id="Rela">7. Relativization</h2>

<p>
Every statement involving a generalized quantifier <i>Q</i> takes
place within some universe <i>M</i>. Sometimes it is useful to be able
to mirror this relativization to a universe <em>inside</em> <i>M</i>.
This means defining a new quantifier with one extra set argument which
says that <i>Q</i> behaves on the universe restricted to that argument
exactly as it behaves on <i>M</i>. Thus, if <i>Q</i> is of type
\({\langle}n_1,\ldots,n_k{\rangle}\), we define \(Q{^{\text{rel}}}\)
of type \({\langle}1,n_1,\ldots,n_k{\rangle}\) as follows:</p>

\[\tag{14}
(Q{^{\text{rel}}})_M(A,R_1,\ldots,R_{n_k}) \mathbin{\Longleftrightarrow_{\text{def}}}
Q_A(R_1\!\restriction\! A,\ldots,R_{n_k}\!\restriction\! A)
\]

<p>
where \(R_i \subseteq M^{n_i}\) and \(R_i\!\restriction\! A\) is the
<em>restriction</em> of \(R_i\) to <i>A</i>, i.e., the set of
\(n_i\)-tuples in \(R_i\cap A^{n_i}\).</p>

<p>
We have in fact already seen several examples of relativization: since
one easily verifies (see the lists \eqref{ex-qlist1} and
\eqref{ex-qlist3}) that</p> 

\[\tag{15}
\begin{align}
\textit{all} &amp; = \forall{^{\text{rel}}}\\
\textit{some} &amp; = \exists{^{\text{rel}}}\\
\textit{at least five} &amp; = (\exists_{\geq 5}){^{\text{rel}}}\\
\textit{exactly three} &amp; = (\exists_{= 3}){^{\text{rel}}}\\
\textit{infinitely many} &amp; = (Q_o){^{\text{rel}}}\\
\textit{most} &amp; = (Q^R){^{\text{rel}}}\\
\textit{an even number of} &amp; = (Q_{\text{even}}){^{\text{rel}}}
\end{align}
\]

<h2 id="ExprPowe">8. Expressive Power</h2>

<p>
We described how generalized quantifiers can be added to <em>FO</em>,
resulting in more expressive logics. A <em>logic</em> in this sense
roughly consist of a set of sentences, a class of models, and a truth
relation (or a satisfaction relation) between sentences and models.
Such logics are often called <em>model-theoretic logics</em>, since
they are defined semantically in terms of models and truth, rather
than proof-theoretically in terms of a deductive system for deriving
 theorems.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 Here we restrict attention to logics of the form
\(\FO(Q_1,Q_2,\ldots)\), formed by adding generalized quantifiers to
<em>FO</em>, where each quantifier comes with a formation rule and a
semantic clause for the truth definition as described in
 <a href="#GeneQuanArbiType">section 5</a>
 above.</p>

<p>
There is an obvious way to compare the expressive power of
model-theoretic logics. \(L_2\) is <em>at least as expressive as</em>
\(L_1\), in symbols,</p> 

 \[L_1 \leq L_2\]

<p>
if every \(L_1\)-sentence \(\f\) is <em>logically equivalent</em> to
some \(L_2\)-sentence \(\p\), i.e., \(\f\) and \(\p\) are true in the
same models. Also, \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) have the <em>same expressive
power</em>, \(L_1 \equiv L_2\), if \(L_1 \leq L_2\) and \(L_2 \leq
L_1\), and \(L_2\) is <em>stronger</em> than \(L_1\), \(L_1 &lt;
L_2\), if \(L_1 \leq L_2\) but \(L_2 \not\leq L_1\). Thus, \(L_1 &lt;
L_2\) if everything that can be said in \(L_1\) can also be said in
\(L_2\), but there is some \(L_2\)-sentence which is not equivalent to
any sentence in \(L_1\).</p>

<p>
How does one establish facts about expressive power? It seems as if in
order to show \(L_1 \leq L_2\) one has to go through all of the
infinitely many sentences in \(L_1\) and for each one find an
equivalent in \(L_2\). But in practice it suffices to show that the
generalized quantifiers in \(L_1\) are <em>definable</em> in \(L_2\).
If <i>Q</i> is of type \({\langle}1,2{\rangle}\), say, <i>Q</i> is
<em>definable</em> in \(L_2\) if there is an \(L_2\)-sentence \(\p\)
whose non-logical vocabulary consists exactly of one unary and one
binary predicate symbol, such that for all models \(\M =
(M,A,R)\),</p> 

\[Q_M(A,R) \iff (M,A,R)\models\p\]

<p>
Similarly for other types. For example, the quantifier <em>all</em> is
definable in <em>FO</em>, since the following holds: </p> 

\[\textit{all}_M(A,B) \iff (M,A,B)\models \forall x(A(x) \rightarrow B(x))\]

<p>
Likewise, \(Q^R\) is definable in \(\FO(\textit{most})\), since </p>

 \[(Q^R)_M(A) \iff (M,A,B)\models \textit{most}\: x(x=x, A(x))\]

<p>
(note that all our logics contain the logical apparatus of
<em>FO</em>, so they are all extensions of <em>FO</em>). The latter is
an instance of the following observation:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="ex-rel1"><span class="tag">(16)</span><span class="sen"> For
any generalized quantifier <i>Q</i>, <i>Q</i> is definable in
\(\FO(Q{^{\text{rel}}})\).</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Such facts about definability can be easy or hard to
 establish,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 but they suffice to establish positive facts about expressivity,
since we have:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
<strong>Fact 4</strong></p>

<p style="margin-top:0;">
\(\FO(Q_1,\ldots,Q_n) \leq L\) if and only if each \(Q_i\) is
definable in <i>L</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>
On the other hand, to prove <em>inexpressibility</em>, i.e., that some
sentence is <em>not</em> equivalent to any <i>L</i>-sentence, is
harder. One way that sometimes works is to establish that \(L_1\) has
some property that \(L_2\) lacks; then one might be able to conclude
that \(L_1 \not\leq L_2\). Some properties that are typical of
<em>FO</em>, but fail for most stronger logics, are:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
The <em>L&ouml;wenheim property</em>: If a sentence is true in some
infinite model, it is also true in some countable model.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The <em>Tarski property</em>: If a sentence is true in some countably
infinite model, it is also true in some uncountable model.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The <em>compactness property</em>: If no model makes every element of
the set of sentences \(\Phi\) true, then there is a finite subset
\(\Psi\) of \(\Phi\) such that no model makes every sentence in
\(\Psi\) true.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The <em>completeness property</em>: The set of valid sentences is
recursively enumerable (i.e., can be generated by some formal
system).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, \(\FO(Q_0)\) does not have the compactness
 property.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 This can be seen by looking at the set of sentences </p> 

 \[\Phi \:=\: \{\neg Q_0x(x=x) \cup \{\theta_n: n = 1,2,\ldots\}\]

<p>
where \(\theta_n\) is an <em>FO</em>-sentence saying that there are at
least <i>n</i> elements in the universe. If you take any finite subset
\(\Phi'\) of \(\Phi\), and <i>M</i> is a universe whose cardinality is
the largest <i>n</i> such that \(\theta_n\) belongs to \(\Phi'\), then
all sentences in \(\Phi'\) are true in <i>M</i>. But no universe can
make all sentences in \(\Phi\) true. And this shows that \(Q_0\) is
not definable in <em>FO</em>, i.e., that \(\FO(Q_0) \not\leq \FO\),
since otherwise we could replace \(\Phi\) by an equivalent set of
<em>FO</em>-sentences, but <em>FO</em> does have the compactness
property, so that it impossible.</p>

<p>
However, this way of proving inexpressibility only works for logics
with properties like those above. Moreover, they only work if infinite
universes are allowed, but interesting inexpressibility facts hold
also for finite models, for example, the fact that \(Q^R\) and
\(Q_{\text{even}}\) are not definable in <em>FO</em>, or that
<em>most</em> = \((Q^R){^{\text{rel}}}\) is not definable in
\(\FO(Q^R)\). Logicians have developed much more direct and efficient
methods of showing undefinability results that work also for finite
 models.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The above properties in fact <em>characterize</em> <em>FO</em>, in the
sense that no proper extension of <em>FO</em> can have (certain
combinations of) them. This is the content of a celebrated theorem
about model-theoretic logics, Lindstr&ouml;m&rsquo;s Theorem, a
version of which is given below. For an accessible proof see, for
example, <span class="citation">Ebbinghaus, Flum, and Thomas
(1994)</span>. We say that a logic \(L = \FO(Q_1,\ldots,Q_n)\)
<em>relativizes</em> if the &ldquo;converse&rdquo; of
 <a href="#ex-rel1">(16)</a>
 holds for each \(Q_i\), i.e., if each \((Q_i){^{\text{rel}}}\) is
definable in <i>L</i>.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 5 (Lindstr&ouml;m)</strong> If <i>L</i> is compact and

<p>
In addition to the truth conditions associated with generalized
quantifiers, one may study the computations required to establish the
truth of a quantified statement in a model. Indeed, generalized
quantifiers turn up in various places in the part of computer science
that studies <em>computational complexity</em>. In this context, we
restrict attention to <em>finite</em> universes, and assume <span class="sc">Isom</span>
throughout. So a quantifier is essentially a
set of finite models; by <span class="sc">Isom</span> we can assume
that models of cardinality <i>m</i> all have the same domain \(M =
\{1,\ldots,m\}\). Such models can be coded as <em>words</em>,
i.e.&nbsp;finite strings of symbols. For example, a model \((M,A)\) of
type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\) can be seen as a binary word \(a_1\ldots
a_m\), where \(a_i\) is 1 if \(i\in A\) and 0 otherwise. Thus \(|A|\)
is the number of 1&rsquo;s and \(|M\!-\!A|\) the number of 0&rsquo;s;
by <span class="sc">Isom</span>, the order in the string doesn&rsquo;t
matter. So <i>Q</i> becomes a set \(W_Q\) of words, that is, a
<em>formal language</em>: a subset of the set of all finite strings of
coding
 symbols.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
We can now ask what it takes to recognize that a word belongs to
\(W_Q\). The abstract notion of an <em>automaton</em> gives an answer;
automata are machines that <em>accept</em> or <em>reject</em> words,
and they are classified according to the complexity of the operations
they perform. The language <em>recognized</em> by an automaton is the
set of words it
 accepts.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup></p>
 

<p>
A <em>finite automaton</em> has a finite number of <em>states</em>,
including a start state and at least one accepting state. It starts
scanning a word at the leftmost symbol in the start state, and at each
step it moves one symbol to the right and enters a (possibly) new
state, according to a given <em>transition function</em>. If it can
move along the whole word ending in an accepting state, the word is
accepted. The application of automata theory to generalized
quantifiers was initiated in <span class="citation">van Benthem
(1986)</span> (Ch.&nbsp;7, &ldquo;Semantic automata&rdquo;). It is
easy to construct a finite automaton recognizing \(\forall\) (or
\(\forall{^{\text{rel}}}=\) <em>all</em>), i.e., checking that
<i>w</i> consists only of 1&rsquo;s: just remain in the start state =
accepting state as long as 1&rsquo;s are encountered, but go to a
rejecting state as soon as a 0 is scanned, and remain there whatever
is encountered afterwards. A slightly more complex automaton
recognizes \(Q_{\text{even}}\): again there are two states, a start
state = the accepting state and a rejecting state, and this time
remain in the same state when 0&rsquo;s are scanned, but go to the
<em>other</em> state when a 1 is scanned. To end in the accepting
state it is then necessary and sufficient that there are an even
number of 1&rsquo;s. This machine essentially uses <em>cycles</em> of
length 2, whereas the first example had only 1-cycles. Call an
automaton of the latter kind <em>acyclic</em>. Van Benthem showed that
the <em>FO</em>-definable quantifiers are exactly the ones accepted by
finite automata that are acyclic and permutation
 closed.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
A slightly more complex automaton, the <em>pushdown</em> automaton,
has rudimentary memory resources in the form a of stack of symbols
that can be pushed or popped from the top, enabling it to keep track
to some extent of what went on at earlier steps. Another result by van
Benthem is that the type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\) quantifiers accepted
by pushdown automata are precisely those for which the corresponding
binary relation between numbers is definable (with first-order means)
in <em>additive arithmetic</em>, i.e., in the model \((N,+)\), where
\(N = \{0,1,2,\ldots\}\). An example is \(Q^R\) (or its relativization
<em>most</em>): we have \(Q^R(m,n) \Leftrightarrow m &lt; n\), and the
right hand side is definable in \((N,+)\) by \(\exists x (x \neq 0
\wedge m + x =
 n)\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Thus, an algorithmic characterization is matched with a logical one.
This is one prominent direction in the study of algorithmic
complexity. Consider now the most general abstract automata or
computational devices, i.e., <em>Turing machines</em>. One (of many)
interesting complexity classes is PTIME: a problem, identified with
its corresponding set of words, is PTIME if there is a polynomial
\(p(x)\) and a Turing machine accepting <i>W</i> such that whenever
\(w \in W\) has length <i>n</i>, the accepting computation takes at
most \(p(n)\) steps. PTIME problems are usually considered
&ldquo;tractable&rdquo;, whereas more complex problems are
&ldquo;intractable&rdquo;, such as EXPTIME ones, where the number of
steps required may grow exponentially. An early result by Immerman and
Vardi is that the PTIME sets of (words coding) finite models are
precisely those describable by single sentences in \(\FO(\LFP)\),
which is <em>FO</em> logic with an added mechanism for forming
<em>least
 fixed-points</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 Here we need to represent not just monadic models but arbitrary ones.
For example, a binary relation on the universe \(\{1,\ldots,m\}\) can
be represented by a word \(w_{11}\cdots w_{1m}\# \ldots \#w_{m1}\cdots
w_{mm}\), where the relation holds of \((i,j)\) iff \(w_{ij} = 1\).
But this time the order does seem to matter, and in fact the Immerman
and Vardi result just mentioned only holds for models with a given
linear order and a binary predicate symbol standing for that
order.</p>

<p>
Logics like \(\FO(\LFP)\) can be recast as logics of the form
\(\FO(Q_1,Q_2,\ldots)\). Here infinitely many quantifiers may be
required, but in some cases a single one suffices. As to
\(\FO(\LFP)\), it suffices to add all the resumptions (see the end of
 <a href="#GeneQuanArbiType">section 5</a>
 above) of a single quantifier. More generally, let
\(\FO^*(Q_1,Q_2,\ldots)\) be like \(\FO(Q_1,Q_2,\ldots)\) but with
mechanisms for making relativizations
 (<a href="#Rela">section 7</a>)
 and for resuming each \(Q_i\) to <i>k</i>-tuples for each <i>k</i>.
Then there is a single quantifier <i>Q</i> such that \(\FO(\LFP) =
\FO^*(Q)\).</p>

<p>
So generalized quantifiers remain a simple and versatile way of adding
expressive power to <em>FO</em>. One natural question was if the
logical characterization of PTIME mentioned above could be improved
using generalized quantifiers, in particular if one could remove the
restriction to ordered structures in this way. The answer, however,
turned out to be negative, since <span class="citation">Hella
(1989)</span> proved that the PTIME computable properties of arbitrary
finite structures cannot be characterized by adding a finite number of
generalized quantifiers to <em>FO</em>, or even to \(\FO(\LFP)\). The
question of whether PTIME can be characterized by a logic of the form
\(\FO^*(Q)\) remains open, however (indeed, solving it would be a
major breakthrough in complexity theory).</p>

<h2 id="GeneQuanNatuLang">10. Generalized Quantifiers and Natural Language</h2>

<p>
In the late 1960s Richard Montague showed how the semantics of
significant parts of natural languages could be handled with logical
 tools.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 One of his main insights was that noun phrases (NPs) can be
interpreted as sets of subsets of the domain, i.e., as (what we now
call) type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\) quantifiers. Montague worked in
type theory, but around 1980 a number of linguists and logicians began
to apply the model-theoretic framework of logics with generalized
quantifiers to natural language
 semantics.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 Consider the structure of a simple English sentence whose subject is
a quantified
 NP:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup></p>
 
<ul class="sentag tag3em avoid-break">

<li id="ex-npvp"><span class="tag">(17)</span><span class="sen">
<img src="ex17.svg" style="width:200px" alt="Linguistics tree [S [NP [Det [most]] [N [students]]] [VP [smoke]]]" />
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
The (subject) NP consists of a determiner and a noun (N). Both the
noun and the verb phrase (VP) have sets as extensions, and so the
determiner is naturally taken to denote a binary relation between
sets, i.e., a type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) quantifier. An utterance
of
 <a href="#ex-npvp">(17)</a>
 has a (discourse) universe in the background (say, the set of people
at a particular university), but the meaning of <span class="fw smaller">most</span>,
<span class="fw smaller">every</span>, <span class="fw smaller">at
least five</span> and similar expressions is not
tied to particular universes. For example, the meaning of <span class="fw smaller">all</span>
in</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em subtag15em">

<li><span class="tag">(18)</span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">a.</span>
<span class="subsen">All cats like milk.
</span></span></li>

<li><span class="tag"></span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">b.</span>
<span class="subsen">All electrons have
negative charge. </span></span></li>

<li><span class="tag"></span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">c.</span>
<span class="subsen">All natural numbers have
a successor. </span></span></li>

<li><span class="tag"></span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">d.</span>
<span class="subsen">All twins like each
other. </span></span></li>

<li><span class="tag"></span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">e.</span>
<span class="subsen">All compact subsets of
Hausdorff spaces are closed. </span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>
has nothing to do with cats or electrons or numbers or twins or
Hausdorff spaces, nor with the discourse universes that may be
associated with the above examples. It simply stands for the inclusion
relation, regardless of what we happen to be talking about. Therefore,
the generalized quantifier <em>all</em>, which with each universe
<i>M</i> associates the inclusion relation over <i>M</i>, is eminently
suitable to interpret <span class="fw smaller">all</span>, and
similarly for other determiners.</p>

<p>
However, it is characteristic of sentences of the form
 <a href="#ex-npvp">(17)</a>
 that the noun argument and the VP argument are not on a par. The noun
combines with the determiner to form the NP, a separate constituent,
and this constituent can also be taken to signify a generalized
quantifier, this time of type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\). Thus, <span class="fw smaller">at
least five students</span> denotes the set of
subsets of the universe which contain at least five students. This
quantifier results from <em>freezing</em> the first argument of the
type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) <em>three</em> to the set of students;
we write this <em>three</em>\(^{\textit{student}}\). In general, if
<i>A</i> is a fixed set and <i>Q</i> a type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\)
quantifier, one may define the type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\) quantifier
\(Q^A\) by</p> 

\[\tag{19} \label{QA}
(Q^A)_M(B) \;\Longleftrightarrow_{\text{def}}\; Q_{M\cup A}(A,B)
\]

<p>
for any <i>M</i> and any \(B\subseteq M\). In a compositional
semantics it is natural to take each constituent part of a sentence to
have a separate signification or meaning, and the default
significations of noun phrases are type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\)
quantifiers.</p>

<p>
This holds also for some NPs that lack determiners, such as proper
names. While the lexical item <span class="fw smaller">John</span> is
assigned some individual <i>j</i> by an interpretation, the
NP <span class="fw smaller">John</span> can be taken to denote the
quantifier \(I_j\), defined, for any <i>M</i>, by</p>

 \[(I_j)_M = \{B\subseteq M\!: j\in B\}\]

<p>
This is in fact well motivated, not only because the interpretation of
NPs becomes more uniform, but also because <span class="fw smaller">John</span>
can combine with quantified NPs:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="ex-john3"><span class="tag">(20)</span><span class="sen">John
and three professors came to the meeting.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Here it is convenient if <span class="fw smaller">John</span> and
<span class="fw smaller">three professors</span> have the same
semantic category. Note that generalized quantifiers&mdash;in contrast
with individuals!&mdash;have a clear Boolean structure; define (here
in the type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\) case, but similarly for any other
type)</p> 

\[
\begin{align}
(Q_1 \wedge Q_2)_M(A) &amp; \iff (Q_1)_M(A) \textrm{ and } (Q_2)_M(A)\\
(\neg Q)_M(A) &amp; \iff \textrm{ not } Q_M(A)
\end{align}
\]

<p>
Then we can take the complex determiner in
 <a href="#ex-john3">(20)</a>
 to denote \(I_j \wedge \textit{three}^{\textit{professor}}\).
Similarly, the complex NP in</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li><span class="tag">(21)</span><span class="sen">John and Mary came
to the meeting.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
signifies \(I_j \wedge I_m\).</p>

<p>
The first argument (coming from the noun) of a type
\({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) determiner denotation is often called its
<em>restriction</em>, and the second its <em>scope</em>. The
difference in syntactic status between these two arguments turns out
to have a clear semantic counterpart.</p>

<h2 id="Cons">11. Conservativity</h2>

<p>
It was observed early on that type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\)
quantifiers denoted by determiners in natural languages have the
following property:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li><span class="tag">(22) </span><span class="sen"><em>Conservativity</em>
(<span class="sc">Conserv</span>):
<br />

    For all <i>M</i> and all \(A,B\subseteq M\), \[Q_M(A,B) \iff  Q_M(A,A\cap B).\]</span></li>

</ul>

<p>
This can be seen from sentence pairs such as the following, where it
is clear that the second sentence is just an awkward way of expressing
the first:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em subtag15em">

<li><span class="tag">(23)</span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">a.</span>
<span class="subsen">Most students smoke.
</span></span></li>

<li><span class="tag"></span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">b.</span>
<span class="subsen"> Most students are
students who smoke. </span></span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(24)</span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">a.</span>
<span class="subsen">At least five professors
were absent. </span></span></li>

<li><span class="tag"></span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">b.</span>
<span class="subsen"> At least five

<li><span class="tag">(25)</span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">a.</span>
<span class="subsen">More than one third of
the graduate students are foreigners. </span></span></li>

<li><span class="tag"></span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">b.</span>
<span class="subsen">More than one third of
the graduate students are foreign graduate students.
</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>
<span class="sc">Conserv</span> says that only the part of <i>B</i>
which is common to <i>A</i> matters for the truth of \(Q_M(A,B)\).
That is, the part \(B-A\) in Figure 1 doesn&rsquo;t matter. This
appears to hold for all determiner denotations, but it fails for
perfectly natural logical quantifiers, such as <em>MO</em> and
<i>I</i> from the list \eqref{ex-qlist3} above. The reason is that it
is characteristic of determiner denotations that the restriction
argument <em>restricts the domain of quantification</em> to that
argument.</p> <!-- [s:ext] -->

<h2 id="Exte">12. Extension</h2>

<p>
Actually, the idea of domain restriction has one further ingredient.
To restrict the domain of quantification to a subset <i>A</i> of
<i>M</i> means not only that \(B-A\) is irrelevant but the whole part
of <i>M</i> that lies outside <i>A</i>, and hence also the part
\(M-(A\cup B)\) in Figure 1. This in turn is an instance of a more
general property, applicable to arbitrary generalized quantifiers:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li><span class="tag">(26)</span><span class="sen"><em>Extension</em>
(<span class="sc">Ext</span>):
<br />
If <i>Q</i> is of type \({\langle}n_1,\ldots,n_k{\rangle}\), \(R_i
\subseteq M^{n_i}\) for \(1\leq i\leq k\), and \(M \subseteq M'\),
then 

    \[Q_M(R_1,\ldots,R_k) \iff  Q_{M'}(R_1,\ldots,R_k).\]</span></li>

</ul>

<p>
That is, nothing happens when the universe is extended, or shrunk, as
long as the arguments are not changed. Now recall that for type
\({\langle}1{\rangle}\) quantifiers we already provided a logical
mechanism for restricting the quantification domain to a subuniverse,
in terms of relativization
 (<a href="#Rela">section 7</a>).
 We can now see (in (b) below) that the combination of <span class="sc">Conserv</span>
and <span class="sc">Ext</span> amounts to
exactly the same thing:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
<strong>Fact 6</strong></p>

<ol type="a" style="margin-top:0;">

<li> For any quantifier <i>Q</i>, \(Q{^{\text{rel}}}\) satisfies <span class="sc">Ext</span>.</li>

<li> A type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) quantifier is <span class="sc">Conserv</span>
and <span class="sc">Ext</span> if and only
if it is the relativization of a type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\)
 quantifier.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup></li>
 </ol>
</div>

<p>
Again, all determiner denotations appear to satisfy <span class="sc">Ext</span>.
At first sight, nothing in principle would seem
to prevent a language from containing a determiner, say <span class="fw smaller">evso</span>,
which meant <em>every</em> on
universes with less than 10 elements and <em>some</em> on larger
universes. But not only is there in fact no such determiner in any
language&mdash;there couldn&rsquo;t be, if the noun argument of a
determiner is to restrict the domain of quantification to the
denotation of that noun.</p>

<p>
A quantifier such as <span class="fw smaller">evso</span> is
intuitively <em>not constant</em>, in the sense that it doesn&rsquo;t
mean the same, or is not interpreted by the same rule, on every
universe. <span class="sc">Ext</span> can be seen as a strong
requirement of constancy: the rule interpreting <i>Q</i> doesn&rsquo;t
even mention the universe. Indeed, many quantifiers from language and
logic are <span class="sc">Ext</span>. As we saw, all relativized
quantifiers are <span class="sc">Ext</span>, and all the other
quantifiers in the lists \eqref{ex-qlist2}&ndash;\eqref{ex-qlist4} as
well, except
 <i>W</i>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>
 In fact, it seems that all quantifiers taking more than one argument
that show up in natural language contexts are <span class="sc">Ext</span>.
And many type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\)
quantifiers are <span class="sc">Ext</span> too, for example,
\(\exists\), \(I_j\), \(Q^A\) (when <i>Q</i> is <span class="sc">Ext</span>;
see \eqref{QA} above), and all in the list
\eqref{ex-qlist1} except \(Q^R\).</p>

<p>
But \(\forall\) and \(Q^R\) are not <span class="sc">Ext</span>. Yet
one is inclined to say for them too that they mean the same on every
universe. The case of \(\forall\) is particularly interesting since
one might argue that it interprets NPs like <span class="fw smaller">everything</span>
or <span class="fw smaller">every
thing</span>. The crux here is <span class="fw smaller">thing</span>.
If this expression is seen as a logical constant that always denotes
the universe, then these NPs do denote \(\forall\): for all <i>M</i>
and all \(B\subseteq M\),</p> 

\[
\begin{align}
(\textit{every}^{\textit{thing}})_M(B) &amp; \iff \textit{every}_M(M,B) \\
&amp; \iff M\subseteq B \\
&amp; \iff M = B \\
&amp; \iff \forall_M(B)
\end{align}
\]

<p>
When <span class="sc">Ext</span> holds, we can usually drop the
subscript <i>M</i> and write, for example, </p> 

\[Q(A,B)\]

<p>
rather than \(Q_M(A,B)\). That is, a suitable universe can be
presupposed but left in the background.</p> <!-- [s:symmon] -->

<h2 id="SymmMono">13. Symmetry and Monotonicity</h2>

<p>
Other properties are not shared by all natural language quantifiers
but single out important subclasses. We mentioned two already in
 <a href="#Aris">section 2</a>
 above: <em>symmetry</em> and <em>monotonicity</em>. Typical symmetric
quantifiers are <em>some, no, at least five, exactly three, an even
number of, infinitely many,</em> whereas <em>all, most, at most
one-third of the</em> are non-symmetric. Another way to express
symmetry is to say that the truth-value of \(Q(A,B)\) only depends on
the set \(A\cap B\). More precisely, call <i>Q</i>
<em>intersective</em> if for all <i>M</i> and all \(A,A',B,B'
\subseteq M\):</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li><span class="tag">(27)</span><span class="sen"> If \(A\cap B =
A'\cap B'\) then \(Q_M(A,B) \Leftrightarrow Q_M(A',B')\).</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
One easily verifies:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p style="margin-bottom:0">
<strong>Fact 7</strong></p>

<p style="margin-top:0;">
For conservative type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) quantifiers, symmetry
and intersectivity are
 equivalent.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup></p>
 </div>

<p>
We noted that some of the syllogisms express monotonicity properties.
In more succinct notation, a type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) quantifier
<i>Q</i> is</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>right increasing</em> (<em>right decreasing</em>) iff for all
<i>M</i> and all \(A,B \subseteq B' \subseteq M\) (all \(A,B'
\subseteq B \subseteq M\)), \(Q_M(A,B)\) implies \(Q_M(A,B')\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Similarly for <em>left</em> increasing or decreasing, and indeed for
monotonicity in any given argument place of a generalized quantifier.
In particular, it is clear what it means for a type
\({\langle}1{\rangle}\) quantifier to be monotone. Monotonicity is
ubiquitous among natural language quantifiers. It seems that
syntactically simple English NPs all denote monotone (increasing or decreasing) type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\) quantifiers,
and almost all syntactically simple English determiners denote right
monotone
 quantifiers.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup>
 We also have:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em subtag15em">

<li><span class="tag">(28)</span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">a.</span>
<span class="subsen">The quantifiers \(I_j\)
(proper names) are increasing</span></span></li>

<li><span class="tag"></span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">b.</span>
<span class="subsen">\(Q^A\) is increasing
(decreasing) iff <i>Q</i> is right increasing
(decreasing).</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>
The Aristotelian <em>all, some, no</em> are monotone in both arguments
(e.g.&nbsp;<em>all</em> is right increasing and left decreasing), as
are <em>at least five, no more than ten, infinitely many</em>, whereas
<em>most, at least two-thirds of the</em> are right increasing but
neither increasing nor decreasing in the left argument. <em>Exactly
three, between two and seven</em> are non-monotone, though both of
these are conjunctions of a (right and left) increasing and a
decreasing quantifier (e.g.&nbsp;<em>at least three and at most
three</em>), in contrast with <em>an even number of</em>, which is not
a (finite) Boolean combination of monotone quantifiers.</p>

<p>
Both symmetry and monotonicity have important explanatory roles for
certain linguistic phenomena. Symmetry is a feature of (most of) the
quantifiers allowed in so-called existential there sentences
(e.g.&nbsp; <span class="fw smaller">There are at least five men in
the garden</span> is fine, but <span class="fw smaller">There are most
men in the garden</span> is not). Monotonicity is crucial for
explaining the distribution of polarity items (<span class="fw smaller">No
one will ever succeed</span> is fine but <span class="fw smaller">Someone
will ever succeed</span> is not: negative polarity
items such as <span class="fw smaller">ever</span> require a
decreasing
 environment).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup>
 Furthermore, monotonicity is crucially involved in <em>natural forms
of reasoning</em>; see
 <a href="#QuanCogn">section 18</a>.</p>

<li><span class="tag"></span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">b.</span>
<span class="subsen"> John&rsquo;s books are
books that were stolen.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>
But in contrast with the previous examples, they are not <span class="sc">Isom</span>,
since they involve some fixed individual or
property: if John&rsquo;s books were stolen, and the number of stolen
books is the same as the number of red pencils (in some discourse
universe), and the number of books that weren&rsquo;t stolen is the
same as the number of pencils that aren&rsquo;t red, it does
<em>not</em> follow that John&rsquo;s pencils are red, as <span class="sc">Isom</span>
would have it.</p>

<p>
However, just as the non-<span class="sc">Isom</span> quantifier
<em>three</em>\(^{\textit{student}}\) results by freezing the
restriction argument of the <span class="sc">Ext</span> quantifier
<em>three</em>, the non-<span class="sc">Isom</span> quantifiers above
result by freezing arguments in more abstract relations, which
<em>are</em> <span class="sc">Isom</span>. We illustrate this with the
possessive determiner <span class="fw  smaller">John&rsquo;s</span>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Given that <span class="fw smaller">John</span> denotes an individual
<i>j</i>, the determiner <span class="fw smaller">John&rsquo;s</span>
can be defined, for all <i>M</i> and all \(A,B\subseteq M\),
 by<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup></p>
 

\[ 
\texttt{John&rsquo;s}_M(A,B) \iff \emp\neq A\cap R_j\subseteq B
\]

<p>
where \(R_j = \{b\in M\!: R(j,b)\}\) and <i>R</i> is some
&ldquo;possessor&rdquo; relation; it is well-known that this relation
varies a lot with the circumstances&mdash;one could be talking about
the books that John owns, or has written, or borrowed, or bought as a
present to Mary, etc. Suppose <i>R</i> is ownership. Then
 <a href="#ex-poss1">(29)</a>
 says that John owns at least one book, and that all of the books he
owns were stolen. Now consider the more general
&ldquo;quantifier&rdquo; defined, for \(a\in M\), \(R\subseteq M^2\),
and \(A,B\subseteq M\), by</p> 

 \[\mathbf{P}_M(a,R,A,B) \iff \emp\neq A \cap R_a \subseteq B\]

<p>
We could say that this is a generalized quantifier of type
\({\langle}0,2,1,1{\rangle}\), letting 0 stand for individuals.
\(\mathbf{P}\) is <span class="sc">Isom</span> (extending definition
\eqref{ex-isom} in the obvious way to quantifiers of this type), and
<span class="fw smaller">John&rsquo;s</span> results by freezing the
first two arguments to suitable values.</p>

<p>
Similar constructions work for other cases of quantifier expressions
in natural languages that denote non-<span class="sc">Isom</span>
quantifiers. For example, the determiner <span class="fw smaller">no _
except Mary</span> denotes (given that <span class="fw smaller">Mary</span>
refers to <i>m</i>)</p> 

\[(\texttt{no _ except Mary})_M(A,B) \iff A\cap B = \{m\}\]

<p>
That is,
 <a href="#ex-except1">(31)</a>
 says that Mary is a professor, that she came to the meeting, and that
no other professor did. Again, a corresponding <span class="sc">Isom</span>
quantifier of type \({\langle}0,1,1{\rangle}\)
is readily defined. So in this way <span class="sc">Isom</span> can be
retrieved for natural language quantifiers. On the other hand,
associating type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) quantifiers with
determiners agrees better with syntax, and allows many generalizations
concerning determiner denotations to hold in the non-<span class="sc">Isom</span>
case as well.</p>

<h2 id="Cons_1">15. Constancy</h2>

<p>
<span class="sc">Isom</span>, i.e., topic neutrality, is standardly
seen as at least a necessary condition for being a <em>logical
 constant</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup>
 It is possible to distinguish <em>logicality</em> from
<em>constancy</em> in the earlier mentioned sense of meaning the same
over different universes. For one thing, logicality is a property that
ought to be <em>closed under definability</em>, whereas it is not at
all clear that constancy should be similarly closed. Note, for
example, that the class of <span class="sc">Ext</span> quantifiers is
not closed under first-order definability. More precisely, it is
closed under the usual Boolean operations, but not under <em>inner
negation</em> and hence not under taking <em>duals</em>, where the
inner negation of a type \({\langle}1{\rangle}\) quantifier <i>Q</i>
is defined by \((Q\neg)_M(A) \Leftrightarrow Q_M(M\!-\!A)\), and the
dual by \(Q^d = \neg(Q\neg)\). For example, \(\exists^d =
\forall\).</p>

<p>
One intuition might be that <span class="sc">Ext</span> suffices for
constancy. But a different intuition is that a quantifier meaning the
same on all universes in particular should satisfy <span class="sc">Isom</span>,
which forces <i>Q</i> to be the
&ldquo;same&rdquo; on all universes of the same cardinality. These two
ideas are incompatible, since together they would imply that <span class="sc">Ext</span>
implies <span class="sc">Isom</span>, which is
manifestly false. Clearly, the vague notion of meaning the same across
different universes admits of different precisifications. On closer
inspection, it seems unlikely that there is one precise version that
would accommodate all intuitions about sameness.</p>

<p>
In this situation, a suggestion would be to simply stipulate that
constancy amounts to <span class="sc">Ext</span> + <span class="sc">Isom</span>.
This would be a Carnapian explication of
constancy. Quantifiers with this combination of properties seem
certain to mean the same on all universes. On the other hand, <span class="sc">Ext</span>
but non-<span class="sc">Isom</span> quantifiers
like <em>three</em>\(^{\textit{student}}\) or <em>some
professor&rsquo;s</em> would not have the same meaning across
different domains, which as we saw accords with one intuition.
Furthermore, the few natural non-<span class="sc">Ext</span>
quantifiers we have encountered are all definable from <span class="sc">Ext</span>
+ <span class="sc">Isom</span>
 quantifiers.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup></p>
 <!-- [s:polyadic] -->

<h2 id="PolyNatuLangQuan">16. Polyadic Natural Language Quantifiers</h2>

<p>
Consider a typical English sentence where both subject and object are
quantified:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="ex-film"><span class="tag">(35)</span><span class="sen">Most
films were reviewed by two critics.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
The truth conditions of
 <a href="#ex-film">(36)</a>
 can be given in terms of a <em>polyadic</em> quantifier, of type
\({\langle}1,1,2{\rangle}\) (omitting <i>M</i>):</p> 

 \[Q(A,B,R) \iff \textit{most}(A,\{a\!: \textit{two}(B,R_a)\})\]

<p>
(This is the &ldquo;narrow scope&rdquo; reading; the &ldquo;wide
scope&rdquo; reading would be instead \(\textit{two}(B,\{b\!:
\textit{most}(A,(R^{-1})_b))\).) But this polyadic quantifier results
from two type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) quantifiers by a ubiquitous
construction that we call <em>iteration</em>. If \(Q,Q'\) are of type
\({\langle}1{\rangle}\), defined the type \({\langle}2{\rangle}\)
quantifier \(Q\cdot Q'\) by</p> 

\[\tag{36}
Q\cdot Q'(R) \iff Q(\{a\!: Q'(R_a)\})
\]

<p>
Then we obtain the iteration of two type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\)
quantifiers \(Q_1,Q_2\) as above with \(Q_1^A \cdot Q_2^B\).
Properties of iterations are studied in <span class="citation">van
Benthem (1989)</span>, <span class="citation">Keenan (1992)</span>,
<span class="citation">Westerst&aring;hl (1994)</span>, and <span class="citation">Steinert-Threlkeld
and Icard (2013)</span>.</p>

<p>
Keenan thinks of iteration as the <em>Frege boundary</em>. As he and
others pointed out, there appear to be many natural language
quantifiers beyond that boundary, i.e.&nbsp;not definable as
iterations. We give a few examples here; many more can be found in the
references just given. The next sentence may look like expressing an
iteration but in fact doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="ex-diff"><span class="tag">(37)</span><span class="sen">Different
students answered different questions at the

</ul>

<p>
Example (37) presumably has various interpretations, for example one
using the following type \({\langle}1,1,2{\rangle}\) quantifier:</p>

\[
Q(A,B,R) \iff \forall a,b \in A(a\neq b \Rightarrow B\cap R_a \neq B\cap R_b)
\]

<p>
This quantifier is still first-order definable but not an
 iteration.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup>
 Next, consider</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em subtag15em">

<li id="ex-res"><span class="tag">(38)</span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">a.</span>
<span class="subsen">People usually are

<li id="ex-res1"><span class="tag"></span> <span class="sen"> <span class="subtag">b.</span>
<span class="subsen">Men seldom make passes
at girls who wear glasses. (Dorothy Parker)</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Adverbs like <span class="fw smaller">usually, seldom, always,
never</span> can be taken to denote generalized quantifiers (an
observation originally made in <span class="citation">Lewis
(1975)</span>). For example, <span class="fw smaller">Dogs never
meow</span> is roughly synonymous with <span class="fw smaller">No
dogs meow</span>. But for
 <a href="#ex-res">(38)</a>
 it can be argued that there is a reading where the quantifier applies
to <em>pairs</em>: among the pairs consisting of a person and a
fireman who rescues that person, a majority are such that the person
is grateful. This is just the <em>resumption</em> of <em>most</em> to
pairs, that we defined in \eqref{ex-qlist4}:</p> 

 \[Res^2(\textit{most})(R,S) \iff |R\cap S| &gt; |R-S|\]

<p>
So in
 <a href="#ex-res1">(38b)</a>,
 \(R(a,b)\) iff \(a \in \textit{person}\) and \(b \in
\textit{fireman}\) and \(a\: \textit{rescued } b\), and \(S(a,b)\) iff
<i>a</i> <em>is grateful to</em> <i>b</i>. It can be shown that for
many quantifiers, in particular <em>most</em>, \(Res^n(Q)\) is not
definable in \(\FO(Q)\). In fact, \(Res^2(\textit{most})\) is not
definable from any finite number of monadic quantifiers, so it is an
example of an irreducibly polyadic
 quantifier.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Next:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em subtag15em">

<span class="subsen">Most of the parliament

</ul>

<p>
Here (39a) can have the truth conditions</p> 

\[\exists X \subseteq \textit{Boston pitcher} [|X| = 5 \amp  \textit{RECIP}(X, \textit{sat alongside})]\]

<p>
where <em>RECIP</em> is the type \({\langle}1,2{\rangle}\) quantifier
defined in \eqref{ex-qlist4}. That is, there is a set of five Boston
pitchers such that if you take any two of those, either they sit next
to each other, or there is one pitcher, or two, or at most three (all
in the chosen set), between them. Similarly for
 <a href="#ex-recip2">(39b)</a>.
 This is just one of several constructions of polyadic quantifiers
that occur in reciprocal
 sentences.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-34" id="ref-34">34</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Finally, consider the sentence</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="ex-boysgirls"><span class="tag">(40)</span><span class="sen">
Most boys in your class and most girls in my class have all dated each
other.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
(40) has been put forward as an example of <em>branching
quantification</em>, which can be written in a two-dimensional logical
format as</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="ex-bwbr"><span class="tag">(41)</span><span class="sen">
<img src="ex41.svg" style="width:380px" alt="'most x A(x)' and 'most y B(y)' each with lines to 'R(x,y)' " />
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
where the intended reading is that there is a subset <i>X</i> of
<i>A</i> containing most of the elements of <i>A</i>, and a similarly
large subset <i>Y</i> of <i>B</i>, such that each pair \((a,b)\) where
\(a \in X\) and \(b \in Y\) belongs to the relation <i>R</i>. More
generally, we have a polyadic quantifier of type
\({\langle}1,1,2{\rangle}\) defined for any \(Q_1,Q_2\) of type
\({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) by</p> <!-- br --> 

<div id="ex-br">
\[\tag{42}\label{ex-br}
Br(Q_1,Q_2)(A,B,R) \iff\\
\exists X\subseteq A \: \exists Y\subseteq B \, [Q_1(A,X) \amp  Q_2(B,Y) \amp  X\times Y \subseteq R]
\]
</div>

<p>
Quite plausibly, this gives a reading of
 <a href="#ex-boysgirls">(40)</a>.
 Note that <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> here are <em>independent</em> of each
other. If one instead would use any one of the linear sentences</p>

\[
\textit{most}\: x(A(x),\textit{most}\: y(B(y),R(x,y)))\\
\textit{most}\: y(B(y),\textit{most}\: x(A(x),R(x,y)))
\]

<p>
then either <i>y</i> depends on <i>x</i> or vice versa. The
two-dimensional syntax in
 <a href="#ex-bwbr">(41)</a>
 reflects this semantic
 independence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-35" id="ref-35">35</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It can be shown that \(Br(\textit{most},\textit{most})\) is not
expressible in \(\FO(\textit{most})\) alone; indeed not with any
finite number of monadic quantifiers (for a proof, see <span class="citation">Hella,
V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen, and Westerst&aring;hl
(1997)</span>). On the other hand, branching quantifiers are obtained
with a &ldquo;lifting&rdquo; operation applied to monadic quantifiers,
and similarly for resumption. Indeed, although natural language
exhibits numerous polyadic quantifiers well beyond the Frege boundary,
one might still make a case for the claim that these are all obtained
<em>from</em> monadic quantifiers in systematic ways.</p>

<h2 id="GQTheoLing">17. GQ Theory and Linguistics</h2>

<p>
The advent of generalized quantifiers had a huge impact on linguistic
semantics via Montague&rsquo;s work in the late 60s, reinforced by the
application of model-theoretic methods in the early 80s by Barwise and
Cooper, Keenan and Stavi, and others (see note
 <a href="notes.html#note-21">21)</a>.
 In almost all examples in these works, the natural language was
English. Linguists have since applied and tested the tools and methods
of &ldquo;GQ theory&rdquo; on other languages. The collection <span class="citation">Bach
et al. (1995)</span> has, among many other
things, seven case studies of quantification in other languages. It
also emphasizes the distinction between <em>D-quantification</em> and
<em>A-quantification</em>. In D-quantification, which most of our
examples so far exhibit, the quantifier expression is (usually) a
determiner which applies to a noun. A-quantification is performed by
other means&mdash;A stands for adverbs, auxiliaries, affixes, and
argument-structure adjusters. Many languages prefer A-quantification,
some exclusively. English has both types; recall the adverbs of
quantification in
 <a href="#ex-res">(38)</a>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-36" id="ref-36">36</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
More recently, the volumes <span class="citation">Keenan and Paperno
(2012)</span> and <span class="citation">Paperno and Keenan
(2017)</span> have a separate chapter answering a fixed set of
questions about expressing quantification for each of 34 different
languages (different also from those mentioned above), in order to
make an extensive inventory of their expressive
 resources.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-37" id="ref-37">37</a>]</sup>
 The approach is semantic: the questions are of the form &ldquo;Can
one express X in your language, and if so in what ways?&rdquo;, which
allows precise questions about conservativity, monotonicity, polarity
items, monadic vs.&nbsp;polyadic quantification, etc.&nbsp;to be put
to each language. The summary in the last chapter shows that many of
the generalizations that hold for English, concerning the existence of
expressions denoting certain quantifiers and the properties of those,
hold in all or most of the other languages studied as well (Keenan and
Paperno list 25 such generalizations).</p>

<p>
On the other hand, beginning in the 1990s some linguists have argued
that GQ theory is unable to account for a range of important semantic
phenomena&mdash;in English and other languages&mdash;related to
quantification. <span class="citation">Szabolcsi (2010)</span> gives a
detailed account of these developments. One issue is that GQ theory
appears to have nothing to say about the compositional meaning of
<em>complex determiners</em>. For example, how is the meaning of <span class="fw smaller">more
than five</span> derived from the meanings of
its parts? Or consider <span class="fw smaller">most</span>, which is
often treated as a simple determiner, even though its meaning must
somehow come from being a superlative of <span class="fw smaller">more</span>.</p>

<p>
Another problematic phenomenon is <em>scope</em>. While GQ theory in
principle seems to allow all theoretically possible scopings of nested
quantifier expressions, natural languages have restrictions regulating
which of these are actually allowed. Indeed, scope is a major topic in
linguistic syntax and semantics, and a complex one. The problem is
also methodological: how to determine if a given sentence <i>S</i>
<em>can</em> actually mean <i>Y</i> (where <i>Y</i> corresponds to a
particular scoping)? First, one must filter out cases where the
unavailability of <i>Y</i> depends on facts about the world, not about
language. Second, whose intuitions should count: the linguist&rsquo;s,
or those of native speakers in a test situation, or perhaps
statistical evidence should play a role? Still, while it is true that
many readings that seem impossible at first sight are in fact
available in sufficiently specific contexts, it is plausible that
languages have scope restrictions beyond the reach of GQ
 theory.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-38" id="ref-38">38</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The &ldquo;GQ theorist&rdquo; could reply that her tools were never
meant to fully explain scope, or enable compositional analyses of
every complex expression. The model-theoretic framework is first of
all <em>descriptive</em>: it provides mathematical objects that can
serve as (models of) meaning, and formulate properties of and
relations between these objects. Sometimes, facts about the
mathematical objects reveal insights about the things they are
modeling, as in the case of monotonicity and polarity items, or the
case of the meaning of conjoined noun phrases. But there is no reason
to expect this to happen in every case.</p>

<p>
These are positions in an ongoing debate about the role of formal
methods, and in particular of model-theoretic tools, in semantics; a
debate which is by no means settled. What seems clear is that the
phenomena related to quantification in natural languages continue to
provide excellent material for that discussion.</p> <!-- [s:cognition] -->

<h2 id="QuanCogn">18. Quantification and Cognition</h2>

<p>
In recent years there has been an explosion of work connecting
semantics, reasoning, and cognition, much of it related to how
speakers understand and learn and reason with quantified expressions.
A major strand of research concerns <em>monotonicity</em> (section
13). Already <span class="citation">Barwise and Cooper (1981)</span>
noted the ubiquity of monotone quantifiers in natural languages, and
suggested a way of showing that monotone quantifiers are easier to
process than non-monotone ones, and that increasing quantifiers are
easier than decreasing ones. They also suggested that psychological
experiments might be used to test their hypothesis. Their technical
proposal was developed further in <span class="citation">van Benthem
(1986)</span>, which introduced a notion of <em>count complexity</em>
and showed that, under some assumptions, the quantifiers with minimal
count complexity are precisely the ones with a certain strong
monotonicity
 property.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-39" id="ref-39">39</a>]</sup></p>
 

<p>
Monotonicity is also involved in what van Benthem has called
&ldquo;one-step&rdquo; reasoning, which appears to be easily available
to speakers. The monotonicity behavior of basic determiners already
shows how such reasoning is licensed. Marking right increasing
(decreasing) type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) quantifiers with a + (a
\(-\)) to the right, and similarly for left monotonicity, we have, for
example:</p>

<div class="indent">
<span style="margin-right:2em">\(-\textit{every}+\)</span> <span style="margin-right:2em">\(+\textit{some}+\)</span>
<span style="margin-right:2em">\(-\textit{no}-\)</span>
<span style="margin-right:2em">\(\cdot\,\textit{most}+\)</span>
<span>\(\cdot\,\textit{exactly three}\,\cdot\)</span>
</div>

<p>
where \(\cdot\) marks that the position is neither decreasing nor
increasing. A nice example is the following inference (from <span class="citation">Icard
and Moss (2014)</span>, adapting an example in
<span class="citation">Geurts and Slik (2005)</span>):</p>

<div class="figure wide" style="margin-bottom: 10px" id="ex-foreign">

<div style="display: table">

<div style="display: table-cell; padding-right:2em">
(43)
</div>

<div style="display: table-cell">
<span style="display: table-row">Most Americans who know a foreign
language speak it at home </span>

<hr style="border-color: black; padding:0; margin:0" />
<span style="display: table-row">Most Americans who know a foreign
language speak it at home or at work</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
The premise is a &ldquo;donkey sentence&rdquo; with <span class="fw smaller">most</span>,
and it is notoriously hard to pin down the exact
truth conditions of these. In fact, several readings are
 possible.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-40" id="ref-40">40</a>]</sup>
 In spite of this, speakers seem to have no problem making this
inference, apparently since <em>most</em> is right increasing (the VP
argument <em>speak it at home</em> is extended to <em>speak it at home
or at work</em>), regardless of what the subject noun phrase (the same
in both sentences) exactly means.</p>

<p>
Many other expressions and phrases besides determiners show fixed
monotonicity patterns. Beginning with <span class="citation">van
Benthem (1986)</span> this has led to algorithms for how <em>polarity
markers</em> are assigned to the nodes of analysis trees of sentences
(relative to a given grammar), or how to incorporate such markers
directly in the type notation; see <span class="citation">Icard and
Moss (2014)</span> for an overview and further references. Besides
their role in inference, such marking can also explain, and sometimes
even predict, the distribution of negative polarity items in languages
(end of
 <a href="#SymmMono">section 13</a>).
 Moreover, in many cases no syntactic analysis is necessary:
inferences can be made directly on surface form, and would in this
sense be available &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; to speakers; compare
 <a href="#ex-foreign">(43)</a>.
 The paper just mentioned also presents a complete axiomatization of a
formal <em>Monotonicity Calculus</em>, in which many varieties of
reasoning with monotonicity can be
 expressed.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-41" id="ref-41">41</a>]</sup></p>
 

<p>
A somewhat parallel development has been the formal study of various
<em>syllogistic fragments</em>; we noted in
 <a href="#Aris">section 2</a>
 that many syllogisms express monotonicity properties. These
fragments, most of which were studied by Ian Pratt-Hartmann and above
all Larry Moss, range from those containing only simple sentences like
<em>allXY</em> or <em>someXY</em> to ones allowing complements,
relative clauses, transitive verbs, non-first-order quantifiers like
<em>most</em>, and other features. Here is an example (Moss p.c.) of
an inference in such a fragment:</p>

<div class="figure" style="margin-bottom: 10px">

<div style="display: table">
<span style="display: table-row">Everyone likes everyone who likes Pat
</span> <span style="display: table-row">Pat likes every clarinetist
</span>

<hr style="border-color: black; padding:0; margin:0" />
<span style="display: table-row">Everyone likes everyone who likes
everyone who likes every clarinetist</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>
This illustrates how quite involved reasoning can be expressed in a
simple syllogistic-like language. The inference is valid, but one has
to think a bit to see
 that.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-42" id="ref-42">42</a>]</sup>
 A main feature of most of these fragments is that, in addition to
having explicit complete axiomatizations, validity in them is
<em>decidable</em>, in contrast with first-order logic. This also
holds for some fragments with quantifiers that are not
<em>FO</em>-definable. Like the monotonicity calculus, the study of
syllogistic fragments is part of the enterprise somewhat loosely
called <em>natural logic</em>, resulting in well-behaved subsystems of
more familiar logics, in the sense of being both closer to natural
language and computationally more tractable; see <span class="citation">Moss
(2015)</span> for a
 survey.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-43" id="ref-43">43</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
On the cognitive side, questions of understanding and learning related
to quantification and monotonicity have been studied both in
psychology and neuroscience. <span class="citation">Geurts and Slik
(2005)</span> asked subjects whether certain inferences involving
monotonicity were valid or not; the results largely corroborated
Barwise and Cooper&rsquo;s earlier hypotheses. The meaning of
individual determiners has also been studied empirically; <span class="citation">Pietroski
et al. (2009)</span> investigated <span class="fw smaller">most</span>,
where the method was to show subjects
a picture with yellow and blue dots for a very short time (to
eliminate counting) and ask, say, if it is true or false that most of
the dots are yellow. Variations of this kind of experiment are common
in the literature; a recent instance is <span class="citation">Odic et
al. (2018)</span>, which studies the mass/count distinction in
cognition and semantics. Both studies involve the human <em>number
sense</em> and its relation to understanding quantificational
language. One might entertain a &ldquo;Whorfian&rdquo; hypothesis that
the latter is a prerequisite for the former. This was tested with
neurobiological methods (brain-scan methods combined with
psychological tests with patients suffering from various brain
disorders) in <span class="citation">Clark and Grossman (2007)</span>.
They did not find any empirical support for that hypothesis; see also
<span class="citation">Clark (2011a)</span> for a description of the
experiment and more on research on quantification and number
sense.</p>

<p>
There are by now a fair number of empirical studies of how various
classes of quantifiers identified by logical or computational means
are reflected in terms of learning, understanding, cognitive load,
etc. Conversely, linguistic and cognitive facts suggest new
theoretical questions. For example, as regards computational
complexity, Sevenster (2006) showed that the branching of
<em>most</em> as in
 <a href="#ex-boysgirls">(40)</a>
 in
 <a href="#GeneQuanComp">section 9</a>
 is
 intractable.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-44" id="ref-44">44</a>]</sup>
 Subsequently, Szymanik observed that if the operations of
<em>resumption</em> and <em>iteration</em> (as in
 <a href="#ex-res">(38)</a>
 and
 <a href="#ex-film">(36)</a>,
 respectively) are applied to PTIME quantifiers, the result is again
in PTIME, in contrast with branching. Similarly, some forms of
reciprocal constructions preserve PTIME computability whereas other
don&rsquo;t: &ldquo;lifting&rdquo; <em>exactly five</em> with
<em>RECIP</em> as in
 <a href="#ex-recip">(39a)</a>
 does, but similarly lifting <em>most</em> as in
 <a href="#ex-recip2">(39b)</a>
 does not.</p>

<p>
In van Benthem&rsquo;s semantic automata setting
 (<a href="#GeneQuanComp">section 9)</a>,
 <span class="citation">Steinert-Threlkeld and Icard (2013)</span>
proved that the Frege boundary
 (<a href="#PolyNatuLangQuan">section 16</a>)
 is robust in the sense that if two <span class="sc">Conserv</span>
and <span class="sc">Ext</span> type \({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\)
quantifiers are recognizable by finite (or push-down) automata, then
so is their iteration. Moreover, <span class="citation">Steinert-Threlkeld
(2016)</span> showed that for
large classes of type \({\langle}1,1,2{\rangle}\) quantifiers, it is
decidable whether they are iterations of type
\({\langle}1,1{\rangle}\) quantifiers or not. A recent presentation of
both theoretical and empirical results around the cognitive aspects of
quantifier recognition is <span class="citation">Szymanik
(2016)</span>.</p>

<p>
Computational models of <em>learning</em> the meaning of quantifiers
have been given; for example by Clark (2011a) in the semantic automata
setting. In a recent development, <span class="citation">Steinert-Threlkeld
and Szymanik (forthcoming)</span>
studies learnability with the technology of neural networks, testing
whether certain quantifiers satisfying three commonly proposed
<em>universals</em>&mdash;that simple determiner denotations are
monotone, <span class="sc">Isom</span>, and <span class="sc">Conserv</span>,
respectively&mdash;are easier to learn than quantifiers that do not
have these properties. For each universal, the time it takes the
network to learn a quantifier satisfying it is compared to the time it
takes to learn a quantifier that doesn&rsquo;t. It turns out that
monotone and <span class="sc">Isom</span> are easier than non-monotone
and non-<span class="sc">Isom</span> ones, whereas there is no
detectable difference for <span class="sc">Conserv</span>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-45" id="ref-45">45</a>]</sup></p>
 

<p>
These are just glimpses of ongoing research. The investigation of how
speakers process quantified expressions, combining the basic
model-theoretic analysis with methods from psychology, neuroscience,
and computer science, is by now a rich area in the study of
generalized quantifiers.</p>

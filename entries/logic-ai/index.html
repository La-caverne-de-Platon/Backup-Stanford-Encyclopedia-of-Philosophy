<h1>Logic and Artificial Intelligence</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Aug 27, 2003; substantive revision Fri Nov 2, 2018</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Artificial Intelligence (referred to hereafter by its nickname,
&ldquo;AI&rdquo;) is the subfield of Computer Science devoted to developing
programs that enable computers to display behavior that can (broadly)
be characterized as
 intelligent.<sup>[<a id="ref-1" href="notes.html#note-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Most research in AI is devoted to
fairly narrow applications, such as planning or speech-to-speech
translation in limited, well defined task domains. But substantial
interest remains in the long-range goal of building generally
intelligent, autonomous
 agents,<sup>[<a id="ref-2" href="notes.html#note-2">2</a>]</sup>
 even if the goal of fully human-like intelligence is elusive and
is seldom pursued explicitly and as such.</p>

 
<p>

Throughout its relatively short history, AI has been heavily
influenced by logical ideas. AI has drawn on many research
methodologies:  the value and relative importance of logical formalisms
is questioned by some leading practitioners, and has been debated in
the literature from time to
 time.<sup>[<a id="ref-3" href="notes.html#note-3">3</a>]</sup>
 But most members of the AI community
would agree that logic has an important role to play in at least some
central areas of AI research, and an influential minority considers
logic to be the most important factor in enabling strategic,
fundamental advances.</p>

<p>

The relations between AI and philosophical logic are part of a
larger story. It is hard to find a major philosophical theme that
doesn&rsquo;t become entangled with issues having to do with reasoning.
Implicatures, for instance, have to correspond to inferences that can
be carried out by a rational interpreter of discourse. Whatever
causality is, causal relations should be inferrable in everyday common
sense settings. Whatever belief is, it should be possible for rational
agents to make plausible inferences about the beliefs of other agents.
The goals and standing constraints that inform a rational agent&rsquo;s
behavior must permit the formation of reasonable plans.</p>

<p>

In each of these cases, compatibility with an acceptable account of
the relevant reasoning is essential for a successful philosophical
theory. But the methods in the contemporary philosophical inventory are
too crude to provide anything like an adequate account of reasoning
that is this complex and this entangled in broad world knowledge.</p>

<p>

Bringing an eclectic set of conceptual tools to the problem of
idealized reasoning in realistic settings, and using computers to model
and test the theories, research in AI has transformed the study of
reasoning&mdash;especially of practical, common sense reasoning. This
process and its outcome is well documented in
 <a href="#russell_sj-norvig:2010a">Russell &amp; Norvig 2010</a>.</p>

<p>

The new insights and theories that have emerged from AI are of great
potential value in informing and constraining many areas of
philosophical inquiry. The special case of philosophical logic that
forms the theme of this article may provide support for the more
general point. Although logic in AI grew out of philosophical logic,
in its new setting it has produced new theories and ambitious programs
that would not have been possible outside of a community devoted to
building full-scale computational models of rational agency.</p>

<p>

This entry assumes an audience consisting primarily of
philosophers who have little or no familiarity with AI. The
entry concentrates on the issues that arise when
logic is used in understanding problems in intelligent reasoning and
guiding the design of mechanized reasoning systems. Logic in AI is by
now a very large and not very well demarcated field&mdash;nothing
like complete coverage has been achieved here. 
 <a href="#nm">Sections 3</a>
 and
 <a href="#ac">Section 4</a>
 provide an overview with some historical and
technical details concerning nonmonotonic logic and reasoning about
action and change, a topic that is not only central in AI but that
should be of considerable interest to philosophers. The remaining
sections provide brief and more or less inadequate sketches of
selected topics, with references to the primary literature.</p>

<p>

 <a href="#minker:2000b">Minker 2000b</a> is a comprehensive

<h2><a name="intro">1. Logic and Artificial Intelligence</a></h2>

<h3><a name="l-in-ai">1.1 The Role of Logic in Artificial Intelligence</a></h3>

<p>

Theoretical computer science developed out of logic, the theory of
computation (if this is to be considered a different subject from
logic), and some related areas of
 mathematics.<sup>[<a id="ref-4" href="notes.html#note-4">4</a>]</sup>
 So theoretically minded
computer scientists are well informed about logic even when they aren&rsquo;t
logicians. Computer scientists in general are familiar with the idea
that logic provides techniques for analyzing the inferential properties
of languages, and with the distinction between a high-level logical
analysis of a reasoning problem and its implementations. Logic, for
instance, can provide a specification for a programming language by
characterizing a mapping from programs to the computations that they
license. A compiler that implements the language can be incomplete, or
even unsound, as long as in some sense it approximates the logical
specification. This makes it possible for the involvement of logic in
AI applications to vary from relatively weak uses in which the logic
informs the implementation process with analytic insights, to strong
uses in which the implementation algorithm can be shown to be sound and
complete. In some cases, a working system is inspired by ideas from
logic and then acquires features that at first seem logically problematic
but can later be explained by developing new ideas in logical theory.
This sort of thing has happened, for instance, in logic
programming.</p>

<p>

In particular, logical theories in AI are independent from
implementations. They can be used to provide insights into the
reasoning problem without directly informing the implementation. Direct
implementations of ideas from logic&mdash;theorem-proving and
model-construction techniques&mdash;are used in AI, but the AI theorists who
rely on logic to model their problem areas are free to use other
implementation techniques as well. Thus, in
 <a href="#moore_rc:1995a">Moore 1995b</a>
 (Chapter&nbsp;1), Robert C.
Moore distinguishes three uses of logic in AI; as a tool of analysis,
as a basis for knowledge representation, and as a programming
language.</p>

<p>

A large part of the effort of developing limited-objective reasoning
systems goes into the management of large, complex bodies of
declarative information. It is generally recognized in AI that it is
important to treat the representation of this information, and the
reasoning that goes along with it, as a separate task, with its own
research problems.</p>

<p>

The evolution of expert systems illustrates the point. The earliest
expert systems, such as M<small>YCIN</small> (a program that reasons
about bacterial infections, see
 <a href="#buchanan-shortliffe:1984a">Buchanan &amp; Shortliffe 1984</a>),
were based entirely on large systems of procedural rules, with no
separate representation of the background knowledge&mdash;for instance, the
taxonomy of the infectious organisms about which the system reasoned
was not represented.</p>

<p>

Later generation expert systems show a greater modularity in their
design. A separate knowledge representation component is useful for
software engineering purposes&mdash;it is much better to have a single
representation of a general fact that can have many different uses,
since this makes the system easier to develop and to modify. And this
design turns out to be essential in enabling these systems to deliver
explanations as well as mere
 conclusions.<sup>[<a id="ref-5" href="notes.html#note-5">5</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="KR">1.2 Knowledge Representation</a></h3>

<p>

In response to the need to design this declarative component, a
subfield of AI known as <em>knowledge representation</em> emerged
during the 1980s. Knowledge representation deals primarily with the
representational and reasoning challenges of this separate component.
The best place to get a feel for this subject is the proceedings of the
meetings that are now held every other year: see

<p>

Typical articles in the proceedings of the KR and Reasoning
conferences deal with the following topics.</p>

<ol>
<li>Topics in logical theory and the theory of computation, including 

 <ol type="a">
 <li>Nonmonotonic logic</li>
 <li>Complexity theory</li>
 </ol></li>

<li>Studies in application areas, including 

 <ol type="a">
 <li>Temporal reasoning</li>
 <li>Formalisms for reasoning about planning, action and change, and causality</li>
 <li>Metareasoning</li>
 <li>Reasoning about context</li>
 <li>Reasoning about values and desires</li>
 <li>Reasoning about the mental states of other agents, and especially
about knowledge and belief</li>
 <li>Spatial reasoning</li>
 <li>Reasoning about vagueness</li>
 </ol></li>

<li>Argumentation and argumentation theory</li>

<li>Aggregation problems of many kinds, such as the integration of
	conflicting knowledge sources</li>

<li>Studies in application techniques, including 

 <ol type="a">
 <li>Logic programming</li>
 <li>Description logics</li>
 <li>Theorem proving</li>
 <li>Model construction</li>
 </ol>
 </li>

<li>Studies of large-scale applications, including 

 <ol type="a">
 <li>Cognitive robotics</li>
 <li>Merging, updating, and correcting knowledge bases</li>
 </ol></li>

</ol>

<p>

These topics hardly overlap at all with the contents of the <em>Journal
of Symbolic Logic</em>, the principal research archive for mathematical
logic. But there is substantial overlap in theoretical emphasis with
<em>The Journal of Philosophical Logic</em>, where topics such as tense
logic, epistemic logic, logical approaches to practical reasoning,
belief change, and vagueness account for a large percentage of the
contributions. Very few <em>JPL</em> publications, however, deal with
complexity theory or with potential applications to automated
reasoning. </p>

<h3><a name="phil-logic">1.3 Philosophical Logic</a></h3>

<p>

A history of philosophical logic is yet to be written.  
Though philosophical logic has traditionally been distinguised from
mathematical logic, the distinction may well be incidental in relation
to the overall goals of the subject, since technical rigor and the use
of mathematical methods seem to be essential in all areas of logical
research. However, the distinction between the two subfields has been
magnified by differences in the sorts of professional training that
are available to logicians, and by the views of individuals on what is
important for the field. </p>

<p>

The statement of policy presented in
<em>Journal of Symbolic Logic</em> (1936, Volume 1, No. 1) lists
bringing together the mathematicians and philosophers working in logic
among the goals of the new journal. Probably at this time both the
mathematicians and the philosophers shared a sense that their subject
was considered to be somewhat marginal by their colleagues, and may
have felt a primary loyalty to logic as a subject rather than to any
academic discipline.  Articles in the first volume of the <em>JSL</em>
were divided about equally between professional mathematicians and
philosophers, and the early volumes of the <em>JSL</em> do not show
any strong differences between the two groups as to topic.</p>

<p>

This situation changed in the 1960s. The 1969 volume of the
<em>JSL</em> contained 39 articles by mathematicians, and only nine by
philosophers. By the early 1970s, many philosophers felt that
philosophical papers on logic were unlikely to be accepted by the
<em>JSL</em>, and that if they were accepted they were unlikely to be
read by philosophers. At this point, the goals of the two groups had
diverged considerably. Mathematicians were pursuing the development of
an increasingly technical and complex body of methods and theorems.
Many philosophers felt that this pursuit was increasingly irrelevant to
the goal of illuminating philosophical issues. These divisions led to
the founding of the <em>Journal of Philosophical Logic</em> in 1972.
The list of sample topics in the first issue included:</p>

<ol>
<li>Contributions to branches of logical theory directly related to
philosophical concerns, such as inductive logic, modal logic, deontic
logic, quantum logic, tense logic, free logic, logic of questions,
logic of commands, logic of preference, logic of conditionals,
many-valued logic, relevance logics;</li>

<li>Contributions to philosophical discussions that utilize the
machinery of formal logic &hellip;;</li>

<li>Discussions of philosophical issues relating to logic and the
logical structure of language, &hellip;;</li>

<li>Philosophical work relating to the special sciences, &hellip;.</li>
</ol>

<p>

Most of the articles over the subsequent 28 years of the <em>JPL</em>
belong to the first of these four categories. But the description with
which this list begins is not particularly illuminating: why should
these particular topics be of interest to philosophers? Their most
important shared feature is a sense that despite successes in
formalizing areas of mathematical logic, the scope of logic remained
severely limited. There are unsolved problems in formalizing the
nonmathematical sciences that seem to require thinking through new and
different logical issues (quantum logic and the logic of induction,
for instance). The remaining topics cover a part, at least, of the
even more pressing problems involved in extending logical theory to
nonscientific reasoning. The dominant goal, then, of philosophical
logic is the extension of logical methods to nonmathematical reasoning
domains. This goal has a theoretical dimension if (as many
philosophical logicians seem to feel) it requires reworking and
extending logical formalisms. </p>

<p>

The development and testing of applications, such as the problem of
formalizing the reasoning involved in getting to the airport, posed as
a challenge in
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1959a1">McCarthy 1959</a>
 (see
 <a href="#commonsense">Section 2.2</a>,
 below), doesn&rsquo;t even appear as a
category in the list of <em>JPL</em> topics, and in fact most of the
philosophical logic literature is theoretical in nature, and is tested
using philosophical techniques. Essentially, this means that the
theories are motivated and tested with small-scale, artificial
examples, selected by the theoreticians. These examples usually serve
more as demonstrations or illustrations than as tests.</p>

<h3><a name="AI-phil-logic">1.4 Logic in AI and Philosophical Logic</a></h3>

<p>

The rough comparison in
 <a href="#KR">Section 1.2</a>
 of the
contents of the main publications for research in logical AI and
philosophical logic suggests the following picture. Theoretical work in
logical AI and in philosophical logic overlap to a large extent. Both
are interested in developing nonmetamathematical applications of logic,
and the core topics are very similar. This overlap is due not only to
commonality of interest, but to direct influence of philosophical logic
on logical AI; there is ample evidence, as we will see, that the first
generation at least of AI logicists read and were influenced by the
literature in philosophical logic.</p>

<p>

Since that point, the specialties have diverged. New logical
theories have emerged in logical AI (nonmonotonic logic is the most
important example) which are not widely known in philosophical logic.
Other differences are due to the AI community&rsquo;s interest in the
theoretical analysis of algorithms and, of course, with their sense of
the importance of implementations. Some have to do with the emerging
development in computer science of ambitious applications using
unprecedentedly large bodies of logical axioms. The sheer size of these
applications produces new problems and new methodologies. And other
differences originate in the interest of philosophical logicians in
some topics (metaphysical topics, for instance) that are primarily
inspired by purely philosophical considerations.</p>

<p>

Concern for applications can be a great influence on how research is
carried out and presented. The tradition in philosophical logic
predates applications in automated reasoning, and to this day remains
relatively uninterested in such applications. The methodology depends
on intuitions, but without any generally accepted methodology for
articulating and deploying these intuitions. And the ideas are
illustrated and informed by artificial, small-scale
 examples.<sup>[<a id="ref-6" href="notes.html#note-6">6</a>]</sup>
 In general,
the philosophical literature does not deal with implementability or
efficiency of the reasoning, or indeed with any features of the
reasoning process. And it is hard to find cases in which the
philosophical theories are illustrated or tested with realistic,
large-scale reasoning problems.</p>

<p>

These differences, however, are much more a matter of style than of
substance or of strategic research goals. It is difficult to think
through the details of the reasoning process without the computational
tools to make the process concrete, and difficult to develop
large-scale formalizations of reasoning problems without computational
tools for entering, testing, and maintaining the formalizations.
Because the core theoretical topics (modal, conditional and temporal
logic, belief revision, and the logic of context) are so similar, and
because the ultimate goal (the formalization of nonmathematical
reasoning) is the same, one can see logic in AI as a continuous
extension of the philosophical logic tradition.</p>

<p>

The early influence of philosophical logic on logic in AI was
profound. The bibliography of
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>,
 one
of the most influential early papers in logical AI, illustrates the
point well. There are 58 citations in the bibliography. Of these, 35
refer to the philosophical logic literature. (There are 17 computer
science citations, one mathematical logic citation, one economics
citation, and one psychology citation.) This paper was written at a
time when there were hardly any references to logical AI in the
computer science literature. Naturally, as logical AI has matured and
developed as a branch of computer science, the proportion of
cross-disciplinary citations has decreased. A sampling of articles from
the first Knowledge Representation conference,
 <a href="#brachman-etal:1989b">Brachman <em>et al</em>. 1989</a>,
 held in
1989, shows only 12 philosophical logic citations out of a total of 522
sampled citations; a sampling of articles from
 <a href="#cohn_ag-etal:1998a">Cohn <em>et al</em>. 1998</a>,
 held in 1998,
shows 23 philosophical logic citations out of a total of 468
sampled.<sup>[<a id="ref-7" href="notes.html#note-7">7</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Despite the dramatic decrease in quantity of explicit citations, the
contemporary literature in logical AI reflects an indirect acquaintance
with the earlier literature in philosophical logic, since many of the
computational papers that are explicitly cited in the modern works were
influenced by this literature. Of course, the influence becomes
increasingly distant as time passes, and this trend is accelerated by
the fact that new theoretical topics have been invented in logical AI
that were at best only dimly prefigured in the philosophical
literature.</p>

<p>

Although philosophical logic is now a relatively small field in
comparison to logical AI, it remains a viable area of research, with new
work appearing regularly. But references to contemporary research in
philosophical logic are rare in the AI literature. Similarly, the
papers currently published in <em>The Journal of Philosophical
Logic</em>, at least, do not show much influence from
 AI.<sup>[<a id="ref-8" href="notes.html#note-8">8</a>]</sup>
 In Europe,
the lines are harder to draw between professional divisions among
logicians: some European journals, especially the <em>Journal of Logic,
Language, and Information</em>, are successful in maintaining a focus
in logic while attracting authors from all the disciplines in which
logic is represented.</p>

<h3><a name="RoleAI">1.5 The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Logic</a></h3>

<p>

The importance of applications in logical AI, and the scale of these
applications, represents a new methodology for logic&mdash;one that would
have been impossible without mechanized reasoning. This methodology
forces theoreticians to think through problems on a new scale and at a
new level of detail, and this in turn has a profound effect on the
resulting theories. The effects of this methodology will be illustrated
in the sections below, dealing with various topics in logical AI. But
the point is illustrated well by reasoning about action and change.
This topic was investigated in the philosophical literature. Reasoning
about change, at least, is part of tense logic, and the consequences of
action are investigated in the literature on &ldquo;seeing to it that&rdquo;; see,
for instance,
 <a href="#belnap:1996a">Belnap 1996</a>.
 The latter
theory has no very robust account of action. The central construct is a
variation on a branching-time modality of the sort that has been
familiar since
 <a href="#prior:1967a">Prior 1967</a>.
 Although it
represents an interesting development in philosophical logic, the scale
of the accomplishment is very different from the research tradition in
logical AI reported in
 <a href="#ac">Section 4</a>,
 below. The
formalisms in this tradition not only support the formalization of
complex, realistic planning problems, but provide entirely new insights
into reasoning about the causal effects of actions, the persistence of
states, and the interactions between actions and continuous physical
processes. Developments such as this would have been impossible without
the interactions between the logical theories and large-scale,
practical applications in automated planning.</p>

<p>

In
 <a href="#carnap:1955a">Carnap 1955</a>,
 Rudolf Carnap attempted
to clarify intensional analyses of linguistic meaning, and to justify
from a methodological point of view, by imagining how the analysis
could be applied to the linguistic usage of a hypothetical robot.
Carnap hoped that the fact that we could imagine ourselves to know the
internal structure of the robot would help to make the case for an
empirical science of semantics more plausible. This hope proved to be
unjustified; the philosophical issue that concerned Carnap remains
controversial to this day, and thought experiments with robots have not
proved to be particularly rewarding in addressing it. Real robots,
though, with real
 applications,<sup>[<a id="ref-9" href="notes.html#note-9">9</a>]</sup>
 are a very different matter. Though it
is hard to tell whether they will prove to be helpful in clarifying
fundamental philosophical problems, they provide a laboratory for logic
that is revolutionary in its potential impact on the subject. They
motivate the development of entirely new logical theories that should
prove to be as important for philosophy as the fundamental
developments in logic of the late nineteenth century proved to be.</p>

<p>

The emergence of separate mathematical and philosophical
subspecialties within logic was not an entirely healthy thing for the
field. The process of making mathematical logic rigorous and of
demonstrating the usefulness of the techniques in achieving mathematical
ends that was pursued so successfully in the first half of the
twentieth century represents a coherent refinement of logical
methodology. All logicians should be pleased and proud that logic is
now an area with a body of results and problems that is as substantial
and challenging as those associated with most areas of mathematics.</p>

<p>

But these methodological advances were gained at the expense of
coverage. In the final analysis, logic deals with reasoning&mdash;and
relatively little of the reasoning we do is mathematical, while almost
all of the mathematical reasoning that nonmathematicians do is mere
calculation. To have both rigor and scope, logic needs to keep its
mathematical and its philosophical side united in a single discipline.
In recent years, neither the mathematical nor the philosophical
professions&mdash;and this is especially true in the United
States&mdash;have done a great deal to promote this unity. But the
needs of Computer Science provide strong unifying motives. The
professional standards for logical research in Computer Science
certainly require rigor, but the field also puts its practitioners into
contact with reasoning domains that are not strictly mathematical, and
creates needs for innovative logical theorizing.</p>

<p>

The most innovative and ambitious area of Computer Science, in terms
of its coverage of reasoning, and the one that is closest in spirit to
philosophical logic, is AI. This article will attempt to provide an
introduction, for outsiders who are familiar with logic, to the aspects
of AI that are closest to the philosophical logic tradition. This area
of logic deserves, and urgently needs, to be studied by historians.  But
such a study will not be found here.</p>

<h2><a name="jmc">2. John McCarthy and Common Sense Logicism</a><sup><font size="-1">[</font><a id="ref-10" href="notes.html#note-10"><font size="-1">10</font></a><font size="-1">]</font></sup></h2>

<h3><a name="logical-AI">2.1 Logical AI</a></h3>

<p>

The most influential figure in logical AI is John McCarthy. McCarthy
was one of the founders of AI, and consistently advocated a research
methodology that uses logical techniques to formalize the reasoning
problems that AI needs to solve. All but the most recent work in
McCarthy&rsquo;s research program can be found in
 <a href="#lifschitz:1990c">Lifschitz 1990a</a>,
 which also contains an
introduction to McCarthy&rsquo;s work
 <a href="#lifschitz:1990d">Lifschitz 1990b</a>;
 for additional historical background, see
 <a href="#israel_d:1991a">Israel 1991</a>.</p>

<p>

McCarthy&rsquo;s methodological position has not changed substantially
since it was first articulated in
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1959a1">McCarthy 1959</a>
 and elaborated and amended
in
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>.
 The motivation for using logic is that&mdash;even if the
eventual implementations do not directly and simply use logical
reasoning techniques like theorem proving&mdash;a logical formalization
helps us to understand the reasoning problem itself. The claim is that
without an understanding of what the reasoning problems are, it will
not be possible to implement their solutions. Plausible as this
Platonic argument may seem, it is in fact controversial in the context
of AI; an alternative methodology would seek to learn or evolve the
desired behaviors. The representations and reasoning that this
methodology would produce might well be too complex to characterize or
to understand at a conceptual level.</p>

<p>

From
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>,
 it is clear that McCarthy thought of his methodology for AI as
overlapping to a large extent with traditional philosophy, but adding
to it the need to inform the design of programs capable of manifesting
general intelligence. This idea is not uncongenial to some philosophers
(see, for instance,
 <a href="#carnap:1956a">Carnap 1956</a>
(pp.&nbsp;244&ndash;247) and
 <a href="#pollock:1995a">Pollock 1995</a>).
 In
practice, the actual theories that have emerged from McCarthy&rsquo;s
methodology are influenced most strongly by work in philosophical
logic, and the research tradition in logical AI represents a more or
less direct development of this work, with some changes in emphasis.
This review will concentrate on logical AI in relation to philosophical
logic, without further comment on relations to philosophy in general or
to the feasibility of developing human-level intelligent systems.</p>

<h3><a name="commonsense">2.2 The Formalization of Common Sense</a></h3>

<p>

McCarthy&rsquo;s long-term objective was to formalize <em>common sense
reasoning</em>, the prescientific reasoning that is used in dealing
with everyday problems. An early example of such a problem, mentioned
in
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1959a1">McCarthy 1959</a>,
 is getting from
home to the airport. Other examples include:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Narrative understanding.</em> The reasoning involved in
reconstructing implicit information from narratives, such as sequencing
of eventualities, and inferred causal connections.</li>

<li><em>Diagnosis.</em> For instance, detecting faults in physical
devices.</li>

<li><em>Spatial Reasoning.</em> For instance, reasoning about the parts
of rigid bodies and their shapes, and their relation to the shape of
the whole.</li>

<li><em>Reasoning about the attitudes of other agents.</em> For
instance, making informed guesses about the beliefs and desires of
other agents, not from &ldquo;keyhole observation&rdquo; but from conversational
clues of the sort that could be obtained in a brief, interactive
interview.</li>
</ol>

<p>

Stated baldly, the goal of formalizing common sense would probably
seem outrageous to most philosophers, who are trained to think of
common sense as rather elusive. But whether or not the ultimate goal
is appropriate and achievable, the specific formalization projects
that have emerged from this program have been successful in several
ways.  They have succeeded in breaking new territory for logic by
extending the scope of the reasoning problems to which logical
techniques can be successfully applied. They have demonstrated that
logical techniques can contribute usefully to the solution of specific
AI problems&mdash;planning is the most successful of these, but some
success has been achieved in other areas as
well.<sup>[<a id="ref-11" href="notes.html#note-11">11</a>]</sup> They
form the basis of one approach to developing complete, autonomous
agents.<sup>[<a id="ref-12" href="notes.html#note-12">12</a>]</sup> And
they have illuminated many specific forms of nonscientific
reasoning&mdash;for instance, qualitative reasoning about the behavior
of physical devices.<sup>[<a id="ref-13" href="notes.html#note-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p> Although McCarthy has advocated this program of formalization
since 1959&mdash;an almost prehistorical date for AI&mdash;the program has
not been taken on board and pursued by a dedicated community until
recently.  Research in this area has gained much momentum since 1990.

<h2><a name="nm">3. Nonmonotonic Reasoning and Nonmonotonic Logics</a></h2>

<h3><a name="define-nm">3.1 Nonmonotonicity</a></h3>

<p>

Aristotle believed that most reasoning, including reasoning about
what to do and about sublunary natural phenomena, dealt with things
that hold &ldquo;always or for the most part.&rdquo; But Aristotelian logic deals
only with patterns of inference that hold without exception. We find at
the very beginning of logic a discrepancy between the scope of logical
theory and common sense reasoning. Nonmonotonic logic is the first
sustained attempt within logical theory to remedy this discrepancy. As
such, it represents a potential for a sweeping expansion of the scope
of logic, as well as a significant body of technical results.</p>

<p>

The consequence relations of classical logics are monotonic. That
is, if a set &Gamma; of formulas implies a consequence <em>C</em> then
a larger set &Gamma; &cup; <em>A</em> will also imply <em>C</em>. A
logic is <em>nonmonotonic</em> if its consequence relation lacks this
property. <em>Preferred models</em> provide a general way to induce a
nonmonotonic consequence relation. Invoke a function that for each
&Gamma; produces a subset
 <span class="scriptuc">M</span><sub>&Gamma;</sub> of the models of &Gamma;; in general,
we will expect
 <span class="scriptuc">M</span><sub>&Gamma;</sub> to
be a proper subset of these models. We then say that &Gamma; implies
<em>C</em> if <em>C</em> is satisfied by every model in
 <span class="scriptuc">M</span><sub>&Gamma;</sub>. As long as we do not
suppose that
 <span class="scriptuc">M</span><sub>&Gamma;&cup;{<em>A</em>}</sub> &sube;
 <span class="scriptuc">M</span><sub>&Gamma;</sub>, we can easily have an
implication relation between &Gamma; and <em>C</em> without imposing
this relation on supersets of
 &Gamma;.<sup>[<a id="ref-14" href="notes.html#note-14">14</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

This model theoretic behavior corresponds to expectation-guided
reasoning, where the expectations allow certain cases to be neglected.
Here is an important difference between common sense and mathematics.
Mathematicians are trained to reject a proof by cases unless the cases
exhaust all the possibilities; but typical instances of common sense
reasoning neglect some alternatives. In fact, it is reasonable to
routinely ignore improbable possibilities. Standing in a kitchen in
California, wondering if there is time to wash the dishes before leaving
for work, one might not take the possibility of an earthquake into
account.</p>

<p>

There seem to be many legitimate reasons for neglecting certain
cases in common sense reasoning. A qualitative judgment that the
probability of a case is negligible is one reason. But, for instance,
in a planning context it may be reasonable to ignore even nonnegligible
probabilities, as long as there is no practical point in planning on
these cases.</p>

<p>

The motivations for nonmonotonicity seem to involve a number of
complex factors; probability (perhaps in some qualitative sense),
normality, expectations that are reasonable in the sense that one can&rsquo;t
be reasonably blamed for having them, mutual acceptance, and factors
having to do with limited rationality.  It may well be that no one has
succeeded in disentangling and clarifying these motivating
considerations. In the early stages of its emergence in logical AI,
many researchers seem to have thought of nonmonotonic reasoning as a
general method for reasoning about uncertainty; but by the end of the
1980s, implementations of fully quantitative probabilistic reasoning
were not only possible in principle, but were clearly preferable in
many sorts of applications to methods involving nonmonotonic logic. A
plausible and realistic rationale for nonmonotonic logic has to fit it
into a broader picture of reasoning about uncertainty that also
includes probabilistic
 reasoning.<sup>[<a id="ref-15" href="notes.html#note-15">15</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="nm-earlyhistory">3.2 Historical Motivations</a></h3>

<p>

Three influential papers on nonmonotonic logic appeared in 1980:
 <a href="#mcdermott_d-doyle_j:1980a">McDermott &amp; Doyle 1980</a>,
 <a href="#reiter_r:1980a1">Reiter 1980</a>,
 and
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1980a">McCarthy 1980</a>.
 In each case, the
formalisms presented in these papers were the result of a gestation
period of several years or more. To set out the historical influences
accurately, it would be necessary to interview the authors, and this 
has not been done. However, there seem to have been two motivating factors:
strategic considerations having to do with the long-range goals of AI,
and much more specific, tactical considerations arising from the
analysis of the reasoning systems that were being deployed in the
1970s.</p>

<p>

 <a href="#commonsense">Section 2.2</a>
 drew attention to McCarthy&rsquo;s
proposed goal of formalizing common sense reasoning. The brief
discussion above in
 <a href="#define-nm">Section 3.1</a>
 suggests that
monotonicity may be an obstacle in pursuing this goal. An additional
motive was found in
 <a href="#minsky:1974a1">Minsky 1974</a>,
 which was
widely read at the time. This paper presents an assortment of
challenges for AI, focusing at the outset on the problem of natural
language
 understanding.<sup>[<a id="ref-16" href="notes.html#note-16">16</a>]</sup>
 Minsky advocates frame-based
knowledge representation
 techniques<sup>[<a id="ref-17" href="notes.html#note-17">17</a>]</sup>
 and (conceiving of the use of these
representations as an alternative to logic), he throws out a number of
loosely connected challenges for the logical approach, including the
problem of building large-scale representations, of reasoning
efficiently, of representing control knowledge, and of providing for
the flexible revision of defeasible beliefs. In retrospect, 
most AI researchers would tend to agree that these problems are general
challenges to any research program in AI (including the one Minsky
himself advocated at the time) and that logical techniques are an
important element in addressing some, perhaps all, of the issues. (For
instance, a well structured logical design can be a great help in
scaling up knowledge representation.)</p>

<p>

Minsky apparently intended to provide general arguments against
logical methods in AI, but
 <a href="#mcdermott_d-doyle_j:1980a">McDermott &amp; Doyle 1980</a>
 and
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1980a">McCarthy 1980</a>
 interpret
 <a href="#minsky:1974a1">Minsky 1974</a>
 as a challenge that can be met by
developing logics that lack the monotonicity property. Perhaps
unintentionally, the paper seems to have provided some incentive
to the nonmonotonic logicians by stressing monotonicity as a source of
the alleged shortcomings of logic. In fact, the term
&lsquo;monotonicity&rsquo; apparently makes its first appearance in
print in Minsky&rsquo;s 1974 paper.</p>

<p>

The development of nonmonotonic logic also owes a great deal to the
applied side of AI. In fact, the need for a nonmonotonic analysis of a
number of AI applications was as persuasive as the strategic
considerations urged by McCarthy, and in many ways more influential on
the shape of the formalisms that emerged. Here, we mention three
such applications that appear to have been important for some of the
early nonmonotonic logicians: belief revision, closed-world reasoning,
and planning.</p>

<h4><a name="3.2.1">3.2.1 Belief Revision</a></h4>

 <a href="#doyle_j:1979b1">Doyle 1979</a>
provides an analysis and algorithm for a &ldquo;truth maintenance
system&rdquo;. The TMS answers a general need, providing a mechanism
for updating the &ldquo;beliefs&rdquo; of knowledge bases. The idea of
the TMS is to keep track of the support of beliefs, and to use the
record of these support dependencies when it is necessary to revise
beliefs.

<p>

In a TMS, part of the support for a belief can consist in the
<em>absence</em> of some other belief. This introduces nonmonotonicity.
For instance, it provides for defaults; that Wednesday is the default
day for scheduling a meeting means the belief that the meeting will be
on Wednesday depends on the <em>absence</em> of special-case beliefs
entailing that it will not be on Wednesday.</p>

<p>

The TMS algorithm and its refinements had a significant impact on AI
applications, and this created the need for a logical analysis. (In
even fairly simple cases, it can be hard in the absence of analytic
tools to see what consequences a TMS should deliver.) This provided a
natural and highly specific challenge for those seeking to develop a
nonmonotonic logic. The TMS also provided specific intuitions: the idea
that the key to nonmonotonicity has to do with inferences based on
unprovability was important for the modal approaches to nonmonotonic
logic and for default logic. And the TMS&rsquo;s emphasis on interactions
between arguments began a theme in nonmonotonic logic that remains
important to this day. (See the discussion of argument-based
approaches, in
 <a href="#nmapproaches">Section 3.4</a>,
 below.)</p>

<h4><a name="3.2.2">3.2.2 Closed-world reasoning</a></h4>

<p>

The study of databases belongs to computer science, not specifically to
AI. But one of the research paradigms in the scientific analysis of
databases uses logical models of the representations and reasoning
 (see
 <a href="#minker:1997a">Minker 1997</a>
 for a recent survey of the
field), and this area has interacted with logical AI. The deductive
database paradigm was taking shape at about the same time that many AI
researchers were thinking through the problems of nonmonotonic logic,
and provided several specific examples of nonmonotonic reasoning that
called for analyses. Of these, perhaps the most important is the
<em>closed-world assumption</em>, according to which&mdash;at least as
far as simple facts are concerned, represented in the database as
positive or negative literals&mdash;the system assumes that it knows
all that there is to be known. It is the closed world assumption that
justifies a negative answer to a query &ldquo;Is there a direct flight
from Detroit to Bologna?&rdquo; when the system finds no such flight in
its data. This is another case of inference from the absence of a
proof; a negative is proved, in effect, by the failure of a systematic
attempt to prove the positive. This idea, which was investigated in
papers such as
 <a href="#reiter_r:1978a1">Reiter 1978</a>
 and
 <a href="#clark_kl:1978a1">Clark 1978</a>
 also provided a challenge for
nonmonotonic logics, as well as specific intuitions&mdash;note that
again, the idea of inference rules depending on the absence of a proof
is present here. </p>

<h4><a name="3.2.3">3.2.3 Planning</a></h4>

<p>

Rational planning is impossible without the ability to reason about
the outcomes of a series of contemplated actions. Predictive reasoning
of this sort is local; in a complex world with many features, we
assume that most things will be unchanged by the performance of an
action. But this locality has proved to be difficult to formalize. The
problem of how to formalize this &ldquo;causal
inertia&rdquo;<sup>[<a id="ref-18" href="notes.html#note-18">18</a>]</sup> is known as the <em>Frame
Problem</em>. </p>

<p>

It is very natural to suppose that inertia holds by default;
variables are unchanged by the performance of an action unless there is
a special reason to think that they will change. This suggests that
nonmonotonic temporal formalisms should provide an appropriate
foundation for reasoning about action and change. So attempts to
formalize the reasoning needed in planning also created a need for
nonmonotonic logics. One of the earliest attempts to formalize
nonmonotonic reasoning,
 <a href="#sandewall:1972a">Sandewall 1972</a>,
addresses the frame problem. Inertial defaults are an especially
important and instructive case study; no more will be said about them
here, since they are discussed in detail in
 <a href="#frame-problem">Section 4.4</a>,
 below.</p>

<h3><a name="earlynmformalisms">3.3 The Earliest Formalisms</a></h3>

<p>

The three 1980 papers mentioned at the beginning of
 <a href="#nm-earlyhistory">Section 3.2</a>
 represent three approaches to
nonmonotonic logic that remain important subfields to this day:
<em>circumscription</em> (McCarthy), <em>modal approaches</em> (Doyle
&amp; McDermott) and <em>default logic</em> (Reiter).</p>

<p>

In
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1993a">McCarthy 1993a</a>,
 McCarthy urges
us, when considering the early history of circumscription, to take into
account a group of three papers: McCarthy
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1986a1">1986</a>,
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1980a">1980</a>,
 and
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1977a5">1987</a>.
 The first paper connects the
strategic ideas of
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>
 with the need for a nonmonotonic logic, and
sketches the logical ideas of <em>domain circumscription</em>, which is
now classified as the simplest case of circumscription. The second
paper provides more thorough logical foundations, and introduces the
more general and powerful <em>predicate circumscription</em> approach.
The third paper concentrates on developing techniques for formalizing
challenging common sense examples.</p>

<p>

All forms of circumscription involve restricting attention to models
in which certain sets are minimized; for this reason, circumscription
can be grouped with the preferred models approaches to nonmonotonicity:
see
 <a href="#nmapproaches">Section 3.4</a>,
 below. McCarthy&rsquo;s
formalism is fairly conservative; though it raises interesting logical
issues in higher-order logic and complexity, it uses familiar logical
frameworks. And much of the focus is on the development of
formalization techniques. The other varieties of nonmonotonic logic,
including default logic and the modal nonmonotonic logics, raise issues
of the sort that are familiar to philosophical logicians, having to do
with the design of new logics, the systematic investigation of
questions concerning validity, and managing the proliferation of
alternative logics.</p>

<p>

As the discussion above of truth maintenance indicated, it is very
natural to think of nonmonotonic inferences as being <em>hedged</em>.
That is, a nonmonotonic inference may require not merely the presence
of a set of proved conclusions, but the <em>absence</em> of certain
other conclusions. The general form of such a rule is:</p>

<blockquote><strong>DR</strong>:
<br />
 In the presence of
{<em>A</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>A</em><sub>n</sub>} and in the
absence of {<em>B</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>B</em><sub>n</sub>},
conclude <em>C</em>.</blockquote>

<p>

An important special case of <strong>DR</strong> is a <em>normal
default</em>, a simple rule to the effect that <em>C</em> holds by
default, conditionally on assumptions
<em>A</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>A</em><sub>n</sub>. This can be
formalized by taking the condition that must be absent to simply be the
negation of the conclusion.</p>

<blockquote><strong>NDR</strong>:
<br />
 In the presence of
{<em>A</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,<em>A</em><sub>n</sub>} and in the
absence of &not;<em>C</em>, conclude <em>C</em>.</blockquote>

<p>

At first sight, it is somewhat perplexing how to formalize this
notion of nonmonotonic inference, since it seems to require a circular
definition of provability that can&rsquo;t be replaced with an inductive
definition, as in the nonmonotonic case. The difficulty with the early
theory of
 <a href="#sandewall:1972a">Sandewall 1972</a>
 is that it does
not address this difficulty successfully.
 <a href="#mcdermott_d-doyle_j:1980a">McDermott &amp; Doyle 1980</a>
 and
 <a href="#reiter_r:1980a1">Reiter 1980</a>
 use fixpoint definitions to
solve the problem. In both cases, the logical task is (1) to develop a
formalism in which rules like <strong>DR</strong> can be expressed, and
(2) to define the relation between a theory <em>DT</em> (which may
incorporate such rules) and the theories <em>E</em> which could count
as reasonable consequences of <em>DT</em>. In the terminology that
later became standard, we need to define the relation between a theory
<em>DT</em> and its <em>extensions</em>.</p>

<p>

In retrospect, we can identify two sorts of approaches to
nonmonotonic logic: those based on <em>preference</em> and those based
on <em>conflict</em>. Theories of the first sort (like circumscription)
involve a relatively straightforward modification of the ordinary
model-theoretic definition of logical consequence that takes into
account a preference relation over models. Theories of the second sort
(like default logic) involve a more radical rethinking of logical
ideas. The possibility of multiple extensions&mdash;different possible
coherent, inferentially complete conclusion sets that can be drawn from
a single set of premises&mdash;means that we have to think of logical
consequence not as a function taking a set of axioms into its logical
closure, but as a <em>relation</em> between a set of axioms and
alternative logical closures. Since logical consequence is so
fundamental, this represents a major theoretical departure. With
multiple extensions, we can still retrieve a consequence relation
between a theory and a formula in various ways, the simplest being to
say that <em>DT</em> nonmonotonically implies <em>C</em> if <em>C</em>
is a member of every extension of <em>DT</em>. Still, the
conflict-based account of consequence provides a much richer underlying
structure than the preferential one.</p>

<p>

Reiter approaches the formalization problem conservatively.
Nonmonotonicity is not expressed in the language of default logic,
which is the same as the language of first-order logic. But a theory
may involve a set of <em>default rules</em>&mdash;rules of the form
<strong>DR</strong>.
 <a href="#reiter_r:1980a1">Reiter 1980</a>
provides a fixpoint definition of the extensions of such a theory, and
develops the theoretical groundwork for the approach, proving a number
of the basic theorems.</p>

<p>

Of these theorems, we mention one in particular, which will be used
in
 <a href="#inertia">Section 4.5</a>,
 in connection with the Yale
Shooting Anomaly. The idea is to take a conjectured extension (which
will be a set <em>T</em>*) and to use this set for consistency checks
in a proof-like process that successively applies default rules in
&lt;<em>W</em>,<em>D</em>&gt; to stages that begin with
<em>W</em>.</p>

<p>

We define a default proof process
<em>T</em><sub>0</sub>,<em>T</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip; for <em>W</em>,
<em>D</em>, relative to <em>T</em>*, as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>Let <em>T</em><sub>0</sub> = <em>W</em>.</li>

<li>If no default rule in <em>D</em> is nonvacuously applicable to
<em>T</em><sub>i</sub> relative to <em>T</em>*, then
<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em>+1</sub> =
Th<sub><small>FOL</small></sub>(<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>), where
Th<sub><small>FOL</small></sub>(<em>T</em>) is the logical closure in
FOL of <em>T</em>.</li>

<li>Otherwise, choose some default rule 

<blockquote>
<table style="border-collapse:collapse;">
<tr><td style="padding:0px;border-bottom:1px solid black; text-align:center;">
  <em>A</em>&nbsp; : &nbsp;<em>B</em><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;, <em>B</em><sub>n</sub>
</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center;">
  <em>C</em>
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

that is nonvacuously applicable to <em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>
relative to <em>T</em>*, and let </p>

<blockquote><em>T</em><sub><em>i</em>+1</sub> =
Th<sub><small>FOL</small></sub>(<em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>&cup;{<em>
C</em>}).</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>

In other words, as long as we can nonvacuously close the stage we are
working on under an applicable default, we do so; otherwise, we do
nothing. A theorem of Reiter&rsquo;s says that, under these circumstances: </p>

<blockquote><em>T</em> is an extension of &lt;<em>W</em>,
<em>D</em>&gt; if and only if there is a proof process
<em>T</em><sub>0</sub>, <em>T</em><sub>1</sub>,... for <em>W</em>,
<em>D</em>, relative to <em>T</em>, such that 

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="middle"><em>T</em> =</td>
<td align="center">
 <font size="+2">&cup;</font><br />
  <span class="index">0&le; <em>i</em></span>
 </td>
<td valign="middle"><em>T</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> .</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>

Thus, we can show that <em>T</em> is an extension by (1) using
<em>T</em> for consistency checks in a default reasoning process from
&lt;<em>W</em>, <em>D</em>&gt;, (2) taking the limit <em>T</em>&prime;
of this process, and (3) verifying that in fact <em>T</em>&prime; =
<em>T</em>. </p>

<p>

The modal approach represents a &ldquo;higher level of nonmonotonic
involvement&rdquo; than default logic. The unprovability construct is
represented explicitly in the language, by means of a modal operator
<em>L</em> informally interpreted as &lsquo;provable&rsquo; (or, as
 in
 <a href="#mcdermott_d-doyle_j:1980a">McDermott &amp; Doyle 1980</a>,
 by
the dual of this operator).<sup>[<a id="ref-19" href="notes.html#note-19">19</a>]</sup>
 Although McDermott and Doyle&rsquo;s
terminology is different from Reiter&rsquo;s, the logical ideas are very
similar&mdash;the essence of their approach, like Reiter&rsquo;s, is a
fixpoint definition of the extensions of a nonmonotonic logic.
Incorporating nonmonoticity in the object language creates some
additional complexities, which in the early modal approach show up
mainly in proliferation of the logics and difficulties in evaluating
the merits of the alternatives. As better foundations for the modal
approach emerged, it became possible to prove the expected theorems
concerning equivalence of modal formalisms with default
 logic.<sup>[<a id="ref-20" href="notes.html#note-20">20</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Reiter&rsquo;s paper
 <a href="#reiter_r:1980a1">Reiter 1980</a>
 appears to
have developed primarily out of tactical considerations. The earlier
paper
 <a href="#reiter_r:1978a1">Reiter 1978</a>
 is largely concerned
with providing an account of database queries. Unlike the other seminal
papers in nonmonotonic logic, Reiter&rsquo;s shows specific influence from
the earlier and independent work on nonmonotonicity in logic
programming&mdash;the work seems to have been largely inspired by the
need to provide logical foundations for the nonmonotonic reasoning
found in deductive databases. Doyle and McDermott&rsquo;s paper shows both
strategic and tactical motivation&mdash;citing the earlier literature
in logicist AI, it motivates nonmonotonic logic as part of a program of
modeling common sense rationality. But the theory is also clearly
influenced by the need to provide a formal account of truth
maintenance.</p>

<h3><a name="nmapproaches">3.4 Approaches to Nonmonotonic Logic</a></h3>

<p>

Nonmonotonic logic is a complex, robust research field. Providing a
survey of the subject is made difficult by the fact that there are many
different foundational paradigms for formalizing nonmonotonic
reasoning, and the relations between these paradigms is not simple. An
adequate account of even a significant part of the field requires a
something like a book-length treatment. A number of books are
available, including

We rely

intellectual motivation, basic ideas, and potential long-term
signifgicance for logic.</p>

<h4><a name="3.4.1">3.4.1 Preference Semantics</a></h4>

<p>

At the outset in
 <a href="#define-nm">Section 3.1</a>,
 it was mentioned how
preferred models could be used to characterize a nonmonotonic
consequence relation. This general model theory of nonmonotonicity
emerged in
 <a href="#shoham:1988a">Shoham 1988</a>,
 five years after
the work discussed in
 <a href="#nm-earlyhistory">Section 3.2</a>,
 and
represents a much more general and abstract approach. </p>

<p>

Preferential semantics relies on a function <em>S</em> taking a set
<em>K</em> of models into a subset <em>S</em>(<em>K</em>) of
<em>K</em>. The crucial definition of <em>preferential entailment</em>
stipulates that <em>A</em> is a (nonmonotonic) consequence of &Gamma;
if every model <em>M</em> of <em>S</em>(<em>Models</em>(&Gamma;))
implies <em>A</em>. Shoham&rsquo;s theory is based on a partial order
&#8828; over models: <em>S</em>(<em>K</em>) can then be characterized
as the set of models in <em>K</em> that are &#8828;-minimal
in <em>K</em>. To ensure that no set can preferentially entail a
contradiction unless it classically entails a contradiction, infinite
descending &#8828; chains need to be disallowed.</p>

<p>

This treatment of nonmonotonicity is similar to the earlier modal
semantic theories of conditionals&mdash;the similarities are
particularly evident using the more general theories of conditional
semantics, such as the one presented in
 <a href="#chellas:1975a">Chellas 1975</a>.
 Of course, the consequence
relation of the classical conditional logics is monotonic, and
conditional semantics uses possible worlds, not models. But the
<em>left-nonmonotonicity</em> of conditionals (the fact that <em>A</em>
 <img src="boxarrow.jpg" alt="box-arrow" /> <em>C</em> does not imply
[<em>A</em>
 &and;
 <em>B</em>]
 <img src="boxarrow.jpg" alt="Box-arrow" />
 <em>C</em>) creates issues that
parallel those in nonmonotonic logics. Early work in nonmonotonic logic
does not seem to be aware of the analogy with conditional logic. But
the interrelations between the two have become an important theme more
recently; see, for instance,
 <a href="#gardenfors-makinson:1994a">G&auml;rdenfors &amp; Makinson 1994</a>,
 <a href="#boutilier:1992a">Boutilier 1992</a>,

 <a href="#asher:1995a">Asher 1995</a>,
 and
 <a href="#thomason_rh:2007a">Thomason 2007</a>.</p>

<p>

Preference semantics raises an opportunity for formulating and
proving representation theorems relating conditions over preference
relations to properties of the abstract consequence relation. This line
of investigation began with
 <a href="#lehmann_d-magidor:1992b1">Lehmann &amp; Magidor 1992</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="3.4.2">3.4.2 Modal and epistemic theories</a></h4>

<p>

Neither Doyle or McDermott pursued the modal approach much beyond
the initial stages of
 <a href="#mcdermott_d:1982a">McDermott 1982</a>,
and
 <a href="#mcdermott_d-doyle_j:1980a">McDermott &amp; Doyle 1980</a>.
 With a helpful suggestion from Robert Stalnaker (see
 <a href="#stalnaker:1993c">Stalnaker 1993</a>),
 however, Robert C. Moore
produced a modal theory that improves in many ways on the earlier
ideas. Moore gives the modal operator of his system an epistemic
interpretation, based on the conception of a default rule as one that
licenses a conclusion for a reasoning agent unless something that the
agent knows blocks the conclusion. In Moore&rsquo;s <em>autoepistemic
logic</em>, an extension <em>E</em> of a theory <em>T</em> is a
superset of <em>T</em> that is <em>stable</em>, i.e., that is
deductively closed, and that satisfies the following two rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>If <em>A</em>&isin;<em>E</em> then
 &#9633;<em>A</em>&isin;<em>E</em>.</li>

<li>If <em>A</em>&notin;<em>E</em> then
 &not;&#9633;<em>A</em>&isin;<em>E</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>

It is also usual to impose a <em>groundedness</em> condition on
autoepistemic extensions of <em>T</em>, ensuring that every member of
an extension has some reason tracing back to <em>T</em>. Various such
conditions have been considered; the simplest one restricts extensions
to those satisfying </p>

<ol start="3">
<li><em>E</em> is the set of nonmodal consequences of
<em>T</em>&cup;{<em>A</em> :
 &#9633;<em>A</em>&isin;<em>E</em>} &cup;
 {&not;&#9633;<em>A</em> : <em>A</em>&notin;<em>E</em>}.</li>
</ol>

<p>

Autoepistemic logic remains a popular approach to nonmonotonic logic,
in part because of its usefulness in providing theoretical foundations
for logic programming. For more recent references, see

 and
 <a href="#denecker-etal:2003a">Deneker <em>et al</em>. 2003</a>.</p>
<p>

Epistemic logic has inspired other approaches to nonmonotonic logic.
Like other modal theories of nonmonotonicity, these use modality to
reflect consistency in the object language, and so allow default rules
along the lines of <strong>DR</strong> to be expressed. But instead of
consistency, these use <em>ignorance</em>. See
 <a href="#halpern-moses:1984a2">Halpern &amp; Moses 1985</a>
 and
 <a href="#levesque:1987a">Levesque 1987</a>
 for variations on this idea.
These theories are explained, and compared to other nonmonotonic
logics, in
 <a href="#meyer_jjc-vanderhoek:1995a">Meyer &amp; van der Hoek 1995</a>.
 In more recent work, Levesque&rsquo;s ideas are systematically
presented and applied to the theory of knowledge bases in
 <a href="#levesque-lakemeyer:2000a">Levesque &amp; Lakemeyer 2000</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="FurTop">3.5 Further Topics</a></h3>

<p>

This brief historical introduction to nonmonotonic logic leaves
untouched a number of general topics that might well be of
interest to a nonspecialist. These include graph-based and
proof-theoretic approaches to nonmonotonic logic, results that
interrelate the various formalisms, complexity results, tractable
special cases of nonmonotonic reasoning, relations between nonmonotonic
and abductive reasoning, relations to probability logics, the logical
intuitions and apparent patterns of validity underlying nonmonotonic
logics, and the techniques used to formalize domains using nonmonotonic
logics. For these and other topics, the reader is referred to the
literature. As a start, the chapters in
 <a href="#gabbay-etal:1994a">Gabbay <em>et al</em>. 1994</a>
 are highly
recommended.</p>

<h3><a name="Prior">4.1 Priorian Tense Logic</a></h3>

<p>

Time and temporal reasoning have been associated with logic since the
origins of scientific logic with Aristotle. The idea of a logic of
tense in the modern sense has been familiar since at least the work of
Jan &#321;ukasiewicz (see, for instance,
 <a href="#lukasiewicz_j:1970a">&#321;ukasiewicz 1970</a>),
 but the shape
of what is commonly known as tense logic was standardized by Arthur
Prior&rsquo;s work in the 1950s and 1960s: see Prior
 <a href="#prior:1956b">1956</a>,
 <a href="#prior:1967a">1967</a>,
 <a href="#prior:1968a">1968</a>.<sup>[<a id="ref-22" href="notes.html#note-22">22</a>]</sup>
 As the topic was developed in
philosophical logic, tense logic proved to be a species of modal logic;
Prior&rsquo;s work was heavily influenced by both Hintikka and Kripke, and by
the idea that the truth of tense-logical formulas is relative to
<em>world-states</em> or temporal stages of the world; these are the
tense-theoretic analogues of the timeless possible worlds of ordinary
modal logic. Thus, the central logical problems and techniques of tense
logic were borrowed from modal logic. For instance, it became a
research theme to work out the relations between axiomatic systems and
the corresponding model theoretic constraints on temporal orderings.
See, for instance,
 <a href="#burgess_jp:1984c">Burgess 1984</a>
 and
 <a href="#vanbenthem:1983a">van Benthem 1983</a>.</p>
 
<p>

Priorian tense logic shares with modal logic a technical
concentration on issues that arise from using the first-order theory of
relations to explain the logical phenomena, an expectation that the
important temporal operators will be quantifiers over world-states, and
a rather remote and foundational approach to actual specimens of
temporal reasoning. Of course, these temporal logics do yield
validities, such as</p>

<blockquote><em>A</em>&rarr;<em>PFA</em></blockquote>

<p>

(if <em>A</em>, then it was the case that <em>A</em> was going to be
the case), which certainly are intuitively valid. But at most, these
can only play a broadly foundational role in accounting for realistic
reasoning about time. It is hard to think of realistic examples in
which they play a leading part. </p>

<p>

This characteristic, of course, is one that modal logic shares with
most traditional and modern logical theories; the connection with
everyday reasoning is rather weak. Although modern logical techniques
do account with some success for the reasoning involved in verifying
mathematical proofs and logic puzzles, they do not explain other cases
of technical or common sense reasoning with much detail or
plausibility. Even in cases like legal reasoning, where logicians and
logically-minded legal theorists have put much effort into formalizing
the reasoning, the utility of the results is controversial.</p>

<h3><a name="sit-calc">4.2 Planning Problems and the Situation Calculus</a></h3>

<p>

Planning problems provide one of the most fruitful showcases for
combining logical analysis with AI applications. On the one hand there
are many practically important applications of automated planning, and
on the other logical formalizations of planning are genuinely helpful
in understanding the problems, and in designing algorithms.</p>

<p>

The classical representation of an AI planning problem, as described
in
 <a href="#amarel:1968a1">Amarel 1968</a>,
 evidently originates in
early work of Herbert Simon&rsquo;s, published in a 1966 CMU technical
report,
 <a href="#simon_ha:1966a">Simon 1966</a>.
 In such a problem, an
agent in an initial world-state is equipped with a set of
<em>actions</em>, which are thought of as partial functions
transforming world-states into world-states. Actions are feasible only
in world-states that meet certain constraints.  (These constraints are
now called the &ldquo;preconditions&rdquo; of the action.)  A planning
problem then becomes a search for a series of feasible actions that
successively transform the initial world-state into a desired
world-state.</p>

<p>

The <em>Situation Calculus</em>, developed by John McCarthy, is the
origin of most of the later work in formalizing reasoning about action
and change. It was first described in 1969, in
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1963a">McCarthy 1983</a>;
 the earliest generally
accessible publication on the topic is
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>.</p>

<p>

Apparently, Priorian tense logic had no influence on
 <a href="#amarel:1968a1">Amarel 1968</a>.
 But there is no important
difference between Amarel&rsquo;s world-states and those of Priorian tense
logic. The &ldquo;situations&rdquo; of the Situation Calculus are these same
world-states, under a new
 name.<sup>[<a id="ref-23" href="notes.html#note-23">23</a>]</sup>
 They resemble possible worlds in
modal logic in providing abstract locations that support a consistent
and complete collection of truths. As in tense logic, these locations
are ordered, and change is represented by the variation in truths from
one location to another. The crucial difference between the Situation
Calculus and tense logic is that change in the situation is
<em>dynamic</em>&mdash;changes do not merely occur, but occur for a
reason.</p>

<p>

This difference, of course, is inspired by the intended use of the
Situation Calculus: it is meant to formalize Simon&rsquo;s representation of
the planning problem, in which a single agent reasons about the
scenarios in which a series of actions is
 performed.<sup>[<a id="ref-24" href="notes.html#note-24">24</a>]</sup>
 In this
model, what drives change is the performance of actions, so the
fundamental model theoretic relation is the relation</p>

<blockquote>R<small>ESULT</small>(a,s,s&prime;)</blockquote>

<p>

between an action a, an initial situation s in which a is performed,
and a resulting situation s&prime; immediately subsequent to the
performance of the action. Usually (though this is not absolutely
necessary) the deterministic assumption is made that s&prime; is
unique. In general, actions can be successfully performed only under
certain limited circumstances. This could be modeled by allowing for
cases in which there is no s&prime; such that
R<small>ESULT</small>(a,s,s&prime;). But usually, it is assumed that
R<small>ESULT</small> is in fact a total function, but that in cases in
which s does not meet the &ldquo;preconditions&rdquo; of a, there are no
restrictions on the s&prime; satisfying
R<small>ESULT</small>(a,s,s&prime;), so that the causal effects of a
will be entirely unconstrained in such cases. </p>

<p>

A planning problem starts with a limited repertoire of actions
(where sets of preconditions and effects are associated with each
action), an initial situation, and a goal (which can be treated as a
formula). A planning problem is a matter of finding a sequence of
actions that will achieve the goal, given the initial situation. That
is, given a goal <em>G</em> and initial situation s, the problem will
consist of finding a sequence s<sub>1</sub>,...,s<sub>n</sub> of
actions which will transform s into a final situation that satisfies
<em>G</em>. This means (assuming that R<small>ESULT</small> is a
function) that <em>G</em> will be satisfied by the situation
s<sub>n</sub>, where s<sub>0</sub> = s and s<sub><em>i</em>+1</sub> is
the s&prime; such that
R<small>ESULT</small>(a<sub><em>i</em>+1</sub>,s<sub><em>i</em></sub>,s&prime;).
The planning problem is in effect a search for a sequence of actions
meeting these conditions. The success conditions for the search can be
characterized in a formalism like the Situation Calculus, which allows
information about the results of actions to be expressed.</p>

<p>

Nothing has been said up till now about the actual language of the
Situation Calculus. The crucial thing is how change is to be expressed.
With tense logic in mind, it would be natural to invoke a modality like
<font size="+1"><tt>[</tt></font><em>a</em><font size="+1"><tt>]</tt></font><em>A</em>,
 with the truth condition</p>

<blockquote>&#8872;<sub><small>s</small></sub><font size="+1"><tt>[</tt></font><em>a</em><font size="+1"><tt>]</tt></font><em>A</em> iff
 &#8872;<sub><small>s</small>&prime;</sub><em>A</em>, where
R<small>ESULT</small>(a,s,s&prime;).</blockquote>

<p>

This formalization, in the style of dynamic logic, is in fact a leading
candidate; see
 <a href="#Steedman">Section 4.7</a>,
 below. </p>

<p>

But
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>
 deploys a language that is much closer to first-order logic.
(This formalization style is characteristic of McCarthy&rsquo;s work; see
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1979c1">McCarthy 1979</a>.)
 Actions are treated as
individuals. And certain propositions whose truth values can change
over time (propositional <em>fluents</em>) are also treated as
individuals. Where s is a situation and f is a fluent,
<em>Holds</em>(f,s) says that f is true in s.</p>

<h3><a name="FormMicro">4.3 Formalizing Microworlds</a></h3>

<p>

Since the pioneering work of the nineteenth and early twentieth
century logicians, the process of formalizing mathematical domains has
largely become a matter of routine. Although (as with set theory) there
may be controversies about what axioms and logical infrastructure best
serve to formalize an area of mathematics, the methods of formalization
and the criteria for evaluating them are relatively unproblematic. This
methodological clarity has not been successfully extended to other
domains; even the formalization of the empirical sciences presents
difficult problems that have not yet been
 resolved.<sup>[<a id="ref-25" href="notes.html#note-25">25</a>]</sup></p>

 The formalization of temporal reasoning, and in particular of
reasoning about actions and plans, is the best-developed successful
extension of modern formalization techniques to domains other than
mathematical theories.  This departure has required the creation of
new methodologies.  One methodological innovation will emerge in
 <a href="#inertia">Section 4.5</a>:
the development of a library of scenarios for
testing the adequacy of various formalisms, and the creation of
specialized domains like the blocks-world domain (mentioned above,
in Section 4.2) that serve a laboratories for testing ideas. 
For more on the blocks world, see
 <a href="#genesereth-nilsson_nj:1987a">Genesereth &amp; Nilsson 1987</a>;
 <a href="#davis_e:1991a">Davis 1991</a>.
 McCarthy&rsquo;s ideas about
<em>elaboration tolerance</em>
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1999a">McCarthy 1999</a>
 provide one interesting attempt to provide a criterion for the
adequacy of formalizations. Another idea that has emerged in the course of
formalizing common sense domains is the importance of an explicit
ontology; see, for instance,
 <a href="#fikes:1996a">Fikes 1996</a> and
 <a href="#lenat-guha:1989a">Lenat &amp; Guha 1989</a>.
 Another is the potential usefulness of explicit
representations of context; see
 <a href="#guha:1991a">Guha, 1991</a>.
  Another is the use of simulation techniques: see,
for instance,

<h3><a name="frame-problem">4.4 Prediction and the Frame Problem</a></h3>

<p>

To tell whether a plan achieves its goal, you need to see whether
the goal holds in the plan&rsquo;s final state. Doing this requires
<em>predictive</em> reasoning, a type of reasoning that was neglected
in the tense-logical literature. As in mechanics, prediction involves
the inference of later states from earlier ones. But (in the case of
simple planning problems at least) the dynamics are determined by
actions rather than by differential equations. The investigation of
this qualitative form of temporal reasoning, and of related sorts of
reasoning (e.g., plan recognition, which seeks to infer goals from
observed actions, and narrative explanation, which seeks to fill in
implicit information in a temporal narrative) is one of the most
impressive chapters in the brief history of common sense logicism.</p>

<p>

The essence of prediction is the problem of inferring what holds in
the situation that ensues from performing an action, given information
about the initial situation. It is often assumed that the agent has complete
knowledge about the initial situation&mdash;this assumption is usual in
classical formalizations of 
planning.<sup>[<a id="ref-26" href="notes.html#note-26">26</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

A large part of the qualitative dynamics that is needed for planning
consists in inferring what does <em>not</em> change. Take a simple plan
to type the word &lsquo;cat&rsquo; using word processing software: 
the natural plan is to first enter &lsquo;c&rsquo;, then enter &lsquo;a&rsquo;,
then enter &lsquo;t&rsquo;. Part of one&rsquo;s confidence in this plan is that
the actions are independent: for instance, entering &lsquo;a&rsquo;
does not also erase the &lsquo;c&rsquo;. The required inference can be
thought of as a form of <em>inertia</em>. The <em>Frame Problem</em> is
the problem of how to formalize the required inertial reasoning.</p>

<p>

The Frame Problem was named and introduced in
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1-hayes_pj1:1969a1">McCarthy &amp; Hayes 1969</a>.
Unlike most of the philosophically interesting technical problems to
emerge in AI, it has attracted the interest of philosophers; most of
the relevant papers, and background information, can be found in
 <a href="#ford-pylyshyn:1996a">Ford &amp; Pylyshyn 1996</a>;
 <a href="#pylyshyn:1987a">Pylyshyn 1987</a>.
 Both of these volumes
document interactions between AI and philosophy.</p>

<p>

The quality of these interactions is discouraging. Like any realistic
common sense reasoning problem, the Frame Problem is open-ended, and
can depend on a wide variety of circumstances. If you put $20 in a
wallet, put the wallet in your pocket, and go to the store, you can
safely assume that the $20 is still in the wallet.  But if you leave the
$20 on the counter at the store while shopping, you can&rsquo;t safely
assume it will be there later.  This may account for the
temptation that makes some 
philosophers<sup>[<a id="ref-27" href="notes.html#note-27">27</a>]</sup>
 want to construe the Frame Problem
very broadly, so that very soon it becomes indiscernible from the
problem of formalizing general common sense in arbitrary domains. Such
a broad construal may serve to introduce speculative discussions
concerning the nature of AI, but it loses all contact with the
genuine, new logical problems in temporal reasoning that have been
discovered by the AI community. It provides a forum for repeating some
familiar philosophical themes, but it brings nothing new to
philosophy. This way of interpreting the Frame Problem is disappointing, because
philosophy can use all the help it can get; the AI community has
succeeded in extending and enriching the application of logic to
common sense reasoning in dramatic ways that are highly relevant to
philosophy. The clearest account of these developments to be found in
the volumes edited by Pylyshyn is
 <a href="#morgenstern:1996a">Morgenstern 1996</a>.
 An extended treatment can be found in
 <a href="#shanahan:1997a">Shanahan 1997</a>;
 also see
 <a href="#sandewall:1994a">Sandewall 1994</a> and
 <a href="#shanahan:2009a">Shanahan 2009</a>.</p>

 <p>
 The purely logical Frame Problem can be solved using monotonic logic,
by simply writing explicit axioms stating what does <em>not</em>
change when an action is performed. This technique can be successfully
applied to quite complex formalization
problems.<sup>[<a id="ref-28" href="notes.html#note-28">28</a>]</sup>
But <em>nonmonotonic</em> solutions to the framework have been
extensively investigated and deployed; these lead to new and
interesting lines of logical development.</p>

<p>

Some philosophers
 (<a href="#fodor_ja:1987b">Fodor 1987</a>,
 <a href="#lormand:1996a">Lormand 1996</a>)
 have felt that contrived
propositions will pose special difficulties in connection with the
Frame Problem. As Shanahan points out
 <a href="#shanahan:1997a">Shanahan 1997</a>
 [p.&nbsp;24]) Fodor&rsquo;s
&ldquo;fridgeon&rdquo; example is readily formalized in the Situation Calculus and
poses no special problems. However, as Lormand suggests, Goodman&rsquo;s
examples
 <a href="#goodman_n:1946a">Goodman, 1946</a>
 do create
problems if they are admitted as fluents; there will be anomalous
extensions in which objects change from green to blue in order to
preserve their grueness.</p>

<p>

This is one of the few points about the Frame Problem made by a philosopher 
that raises a genuine difficulty for
the formal solutions. But the difficulty is peripheral, since the
example is not realistic. Recall that fluents are represented as
first-order individuals. Although fluents are situation-dependent
functions, an axiom of comprehension is certainly not assumed for
fluents. In fact, it is generally supposed that the domain of fluents
will be a very limited set of the totality of situation-dependent
functions; typically, it will be a relatively small finite set of
variables representing features of the domain considered to be
important.  In particular cases these will be chosen in much the same
way that a set of variables is chosen in statistical modeling.</p>

<p>

There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a systematic account in the AI literature of
how to choose an appropriate set of fluents, but it would certainly be
part of such an account that all fluents should correspond to
projectable predicates, in Goodman&rsquo;s sense.</p>

<h3><a name="inertia">4.5 Nonmonotonic Treatments of Inertia and a 
Package of Problems</a></h3>

<p>

The idea behind nonmonotonic solutions to the Frame Problem is to
treat inertia as a default; changes are assumed to occur only if there
is some special reason for them to occur. In an action-centered account
of change, this means that absence of change is assumed when an action
is performed unless a reason for the change can be found in axioms for
the action.</p>

<p>

For explicitness, let&rsquo;s use Reiter&rsquo;s default logic to illustrate
the formalization. Recall that in Reiter&rsquo;s theory, defaults are
represented as rules, not formulas, so that they are not subject to
quantification. To formalize inertia, then, we need to use default rule
schemata. For each fluent f, action a, and situation s, the set of
these schemata will include an instance of the following schema:</p>

<blockquote>
<table style="border-collapse:collapse;">
<tr><td rowspan="2">
  <strong>IR(f, a, s) &nbsp; </strong>
</td><td style="padding:0px;border-bottom:1px solid black; text-align:center;">
  T&nbsp;:&nbsp;<em>Holds</em>(f,s) &harr; <em>Holds</em>(f,R<small>ESULT</small>(a,s))
</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center;">
  <em>Holds</em>(f,s) &harr; <em>Holds</em>(f,R<small>ESULT</small>(a,s))
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

This way of doing things makes any case in which a fluent changes
truth value a <em>prima facie</em> anomaly. But it follows from
Reiter&rsquo;s account of extensions that such defaults are overridden when
they conflict with the monotonic theory of situation dynamics. So if,
for instance, there is a monotonic causal axiom for the action
<tt>blacken</tt> ensuring that blackening a block will make it black in
the resulting situation, then the appropriate instance of
<strong>IR</strong> will be inefficacious, and there will be no
extension in which a white block remains white when it is
blackened.</p>

<p>

The Frame Problem somehow managed to capture the attention of a wide
community&mdash;but if one is interested in understanding the complex
problems that arise in generalizing formalisms like the Situation
Calculus, while at the same time ensuring that they deliver plausible
solutions to a wide variety of scenarios, it is more useful to consider
a larger range of problems. For the AI community, the larger problems
include the Frame Problem itself, the Qualification Problem, the
Ramification Problem, generalizability along a number of important
dimensions including incomplete information, concurrency (multiple
agents), and continuous change, and finally a large assortment of
specific challenges such as the scenarios mentioned later in this
section.</p>

<p>

The <em>Qualification Problem</em> arises generally in connection
with the formalization of common sense generalizations. Typically,
these involve exceptions, and these exceptions&mdash;especially if
one is willing to entertain far-fetched circumstances&mdash;can
iterate endlessly. The same phenomenon, under a label like &lsquo;the
problem of <em>ceteris paribus</em> generalizations&rsquo;, is familiar
from analytic philosophy. It also comes up in the semantics of
<em>generic</em> constructions found in natural languages.<sup>[<a id="ref-29" href="notes.html#note-29">29</a>]</sup> In a sense, this
problem is addressed at a general level by nonmonotonic logics,
which&mdash;though they do not provide a way to enumerate
exceptions&mdash;do allow common sense generalizations to be
formulated as defaults, as well as enabling further qualifications to
be added nondestructively. Ideally, then, the initial generalization
can be stated as an axiom and qualifications can be added
incrementally in the form of further axioms.</p>

<p>

The Qualification Problem was raised in
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1986a1">McCarthy 1986</a>,
 where it was motivated
chiefly by generalizations concerning the consequences of actions;
McCarthy considers in some detail the generalization that turning the
ignition key in an automobile will start the car. Much the same point,
in fact, can be made about virtually any action, including stacking one
block on another&mdash;the standard action that is used to illustrate
the Situation Calculus. A circumscriptive approach to the Qualification
Problem is presented in
 <a href="#lifschitz:1987c">Lifschitz 1987</a>;
this explicitly introduces the precondition relation between an action
and its preconditions into the formalism, and circumscriptively
minimizes preconditions, eliminating from preferred models any &ldquo;unknown
preconditions&rdquo; that might render an action inefficacious.</p>

<p>

Several dimensions of the Qualification Problem remain as broad,
challenging research problems. For one thing, not every nonmonotonic
logic provides graceful mechanisms for qualification. Default logic,
for instance, does not deliver the intuitively desired conclusions.
Suppose one formalizes the common sense generalization that if you press
the &lsquo;a&rsquo; key on a computer it will type &lsquo;a&rsquo; as
a normal default:</p>

<table style="border-collapse:collapse;">
<tr><td style="padding:0px;border-bottom:1px solid black; text-align:center;">
  T&thinsp;:&thinsp;V<small>ALUE</small>(<tt>text</tt>, R<small>ESULT</small>(<tt>Press-a</tt>,s)) = V<small>ALUE</small>(<tt>text</tt>,s) + &lsquo;a&rsquo;
</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center;">
  V<small>ALUE</small>(<tt>text</tt>, R<small>ESULT</small>(<tt>Press-a</tt>,s)) = V<small>ALUE</small>(<tt>text</tt>,s) + &lsquo;a&rsquo;
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>

If we then formalize the exception to this generalization that if you
press the &lsquo;a&rsquo; key while the Alt key is depressed the
cursor moves to the beginning of the current sentence as a normal
default along the same lines, we get <em>two</em> extensions: one in
which pressing &lsquo;a&rsquo; while the Alt key is depressed moves
the cursor and another in which it adds &lsquo;a&rsquo; to the
text.</p>

<p>

The problem is that default logic does not provide for more specific
defaults to override ones that are more general. This principle of
specificity has been discussed at length in the literature.
Incorporating it in a nonmonotonic logic can complicate the theory
considerably; see, for instance,
 <a href="#asher-morreau:1991a">Asher &amp; Morreau 1991</a>
 and
 <a href="#horty:1994a">Horty 1994</a>.
 And,
as
 <a href="#elkan:1995a">Elkan 1995</a>
 points out, the Qualification
Problem raises computational issues. </p>

<p>

Relatively little attention has been given to the Qualification
Problem for characterizing actions, in comparison with other problems
in temporal reasoning. In particular, the standard accounts of
<em>unsuccessful</em> actions are somewhat unintuitive. In the
formalization of
 <a href="#lifschitz:1987c">Lifschitz 1987</a>,
 for instance, actions with some unsatisfied preconditions are only
distinguished from actions whose preconditions all succeed in that
the conventional effects of the action will only be ensured when the
preconditions are met. It is as if an action of spending $1,000,000
can be performed at any moment&mdash;although if you don&rsquo;t have the
money, no effects in particular will be guaranteed. 
 <sup>[<a id="ref-30" href="notes.html#note-30">30</a>]</sup> And there
is no distinction between actions that cannot even be attempted (like
boarding a plane in London when you are in Sydney), actions that can
be attempted, but in which the attempt can be expected to go wrong
(like making a withdrawal when you have insufficient funds), actions
that can be attempted with reasonable hope of success, and actions
that can be attempted with guaranteed success. As J.L. Austin made
clear in
 <a href="#austin:1961x">Austin 1961</a>,
 the ways in which actions can be
attempted, and in which attempted actions can fail, are a well
developed part of common sense reasoning. Obviously, in contemplating a
plan containing actions that may fail, one may need to reason about the
consequences of failure. Formalizing the pathology of actions,
providing a systematic theory of ways in which actions and the plans
that contain them can go wrong, would be a useful addition to planning
formalisms, and one that would illuminate important themes in
philosophy.</p>

<p>

The challenge posed by the <em>Ramification Problem</em>
(characterized first in
 <a href="#finger_j:1987a">Finger 1987</a>)
 is
to formalize the indirect consequences of actions, where &ldquo;indirect&rdquo;
effects are not
 delayed,<sup>[<a id="ref-31" href="notes.html#note-31">31</a>]</sup>
 but are temporally immediate but causally derivative. If one walks into
a room, the direct effect is that one is now in the room. There are also
many indirect effects: for instance, that one&rsquo;s shirt also is now in the
room.</p>

<p>

 You can see from this that the formulation of the problem
presupposes a distinction between direct consequences of actions (ones
that attach directly to an action, and that are ensured by the
successful performance of the action) and other consequences. This
assumption is generally accepted without question in the AI literature
on action formalisms. You can make a good case for its common sense
plausibility&mdash;for instance, many of our words for actions
(&lsquo;to warm&rsquo;, to &lsquo;lengthen&rsquo;, &lsquo;to
ensure&rsquo;) are derived from the effects that are conventionally
associated with them. And in these cases, success is entailed: if
someone has warmed something, this entails that it became warm.
<sup>[<a id="ref-32" href="notes.html#note-32">32</a>]</sup> A typical
example is discussed in
 <a href="#lin_fz:1995a">Lin 1995</a>:
a certain suitcase has two locks, and is open if and only if both locks
are open. Then (assuming that actions are not performed concurrently)
opening one lock will open the suitcase if and only if the other lock
is open. Here, opening a lock is an action, with direct consequences;
opening a suitcase is not an action, it is an indirect effect.</p>

<p>

Obviously, the Ramification Problem is intimately connected with the
Frame Problem. In approaches that adopt nonmonotonic solutions to the
Frame Problem, inertial defaults will need to be overridden by
conclusions about ramifications in order to obtain correct results. In
case the left lock of the suitcase is open, for instance, and an action
of opening the right lock is performed, then the default conclusion
that the suitcase remains closed needs somehow to be suppressed. Some
approaches to the Ramification Problem depend on the development of
theories of common sense causation, and therefore are closely related
to the causal approaches to reasoning about time and action discussed
below in
 <a href="#FP-frameworks">Section 4.6</a>.
 See, for
 instance,
 <a href="#giunchiglia_e-etal:1997a">Giunchiglia <em>et al</em>. 1997</a>,
 <a href="#thielscher:1997a">Thielscher 1989</a>,
 <a href="#lin_fz:1995a">Lin 1995</a>.</p>

<p>

Philosophical logicians have been content to illustrate their ideas
with relatively small-scale examples. The formalization of even
large-scale mathematical theories is relatively unproblematic. Logicist
AI is the first branch of logic to undertake the task of formalizing
large examples involving nontrivial common sense reasoning. In doing
so, the field has had to invent new methods. An important part of the
methodology that has emerged in formalizing action and change is the
prominence that is given to challenges, posed in the form of
<em>scenarios</em>. These scenarios represent formalization problems
which usually involve relatively simple, realistic examples designed to
challenge the logical theories in specific ways. Typically, there will
be clear common sense intuitions about the inferences that should be
drawn in these cases. The challenge is to design a logical formalism
that will provide general, well-motivated solutions to these benchmark
problems.</p>

<p>

Among the many scenarios that have been discussed in the literature
are the Baby Scenario, the Bus Ride Scenario, the Chess Board Scenario,
the Ferryboat Connection Scenario, the Furniture Assembly Scenario, the
Hiding Turkey Scenario, the Kitchen Sink Scenario, the Russian Turkey
Scenario, the Stanford Murder Mystery, the Stockholm Delivery Scenario,
the Stolen Car Scenario, the Stuffy Room Scenario, the Ticketed Car
Scenario, the Walking Turkey Scenario, and the Yale Shooting Anomaly.
Accounts of these can be found in
 <a href="#shanahan:1997a">Shanahan 1997</a>
 and
 <a href="#sandewall:1994a">Sandewall 1994</a>;
 see
especially
 <a href="#sandewall:1994a">Sandewall 1994</a>[Chapters&nbsp;2
 and 7].</p>

<p>

Many of these scenarios are designed to test advanced problems that
will not be discussed here&mdash;for instance, challenges dealing with
multiple agents, or with continuous changes. Here, we concentrate
on one of the earliest, and probably the most subtle of these
scenarios: the Yale Shooting Anomaly, first reported in
 <a href="#hanks-mcdermott_d:1985a">Hanks &amp; McDermott 1985</a>
 and
published in
 <a href="#hanks-mcdermott_d:1986a">Hanks &amp; McDermott 1986</a>;
 <a href="#hanks-mcdermott_d:1987b">Hanks &amp; McDermott 1987</a>.</p>

<p>

The Yale Shooting Anomaly involves three actions: <tt>load</tt>,
<tt>shoot</tt>, and <tt>wait</tt>. A propositional fluent
<tt>Loaded</tt> tracks whether a certain pistol is loaded; another
fluent, <tt>Alive</tt>, tracks whether a certain person, Fred, is
alive. <tt>load</tt> has no preconditions; its only effect is
<tt>Loaded</tt>. The fluent <tt>shoot</tt> has <tt>Loaded</tt> as its
only precondition and <tt>Alive</tt> as a negative effect;
<tt>wait</tt> has no preconditions and no effects.</p>

<p>

Causal information regarding the axioms is formalized as
follows.</p>

<table cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td><strong>Load</strong></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap">&forall;s<em>Holds</em>(<tt>Loaded</tt>,
R<small>ESULT</small>(<tt>load</tt>,s))</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap"><strong>Shoot 1</strong></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap">&forall;s[<em>Holds</em>(<tt>Loaded</tt>,s) &rarr;
<em>Holds</em>(&not;<tt>Alive</tt>,
R<small>ESULT</small>(<tt>shoot</tt>,s))]</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap"><strong>Shoot 2</strong></td>
<td nowrap="nowrap">&forall;s[<em>Holds</em>(<tt>Loaded</tt>,s) &rarr;
<em>Holds</em>(&not;<tt>Loaded</tt>,
R<small>ESULT</small>(<tt>shoot</tt>,s))]</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>

There is no Wait Axiom&mdash;that is, <tt>wait</tt> has no
preconditions and no effects.</p>

<p>

We will formalize the inertial reasoning in this scenario using a
nonmonotonic logic&mdash;to be specific, we use Reiter&rsquo;s default logic.
The set <em>D</em> of defaults for this theory consists of all
instances of the inertial schema <strong>IR</strong>. In the initial
situation, Fred is alive and the pistol is unloaded.</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td><strong>IC1</strong></td>
<td><em>Holds</em>(<tt>Alive</tt>,s<sub>0</sub>)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><strong>IC2</strong></td>
<td>&not;<em>Holds</em>(<tt>Loaded</tt>,s<sub>0</sub>)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

The monotonic theory <em>W</em> of the scenario consists of: (1) the
action axioms <strong>Load</strong>, <strong>Shoot 1</strong> and
<strong>Shoot 2</strong> and (2) the initial conditions
<strong>IC1</strong> and <strong>IC2</strong>. Let s<sub>1</sub> =
R<small>ESULT</small>(<tt>load</tt>,s<sub>0</sub>), s<sub>2</sub> =
R<small>ESULT</small>(<tt>wait</tt>,s<sub>1</sub>), and s<sub>3</sub> =
R<small>ESULT</small>(<tt>shoot</tt>,s<sub>2</sub>). </p>

<p>

The Yale Shooting Anomaly arises because this theory
allows an extension in which the actions are <tt>load</tt>;
<tt>shoot</tt>; <tt>wait</tt>, and in the final situation
<em>s</em><sub>3</sub>, the pistol is unloaded and Fred is alive. The
initial situation in the Anomaly and the three actions, with their
resulting situations, can be pictured as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="bottom">s<sub>0</sub></td>
<td align="center"><tt>load</tt>
<br />
 &rarr;</td>
<td valign="bottom">s<sub>1</sub></td>
<td align="center"><tt>wait</tt>
<br />
 &rarr;</td>
<td valign="bottom">s<sub>2</sub></td>
<td align="center"><tt>shoot</tt>
<br />
 &rarr;</td>
<td valign="bottom">s<sub>3</sub></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

The natural, expected outcome of these axioms is that the pistol is
loaded and Fred is alive after waiting, so that shooting yields a final
outcome in which Fred is not alive and the pistol is unloaded. There is
no problem in showing that this corresponds to an extension; the
problem is the presence of the other, anomalous extension, which looks
like this.</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
<td valign="bottom" align="center"><font size="-1"><tt>Alive</tt>
<br />
&not;<tt>Loaded</tt>
<br />
s<sub>0</sub></font></td>
<td align="center"><font size="-1"><tt>load</tt></font>
<br />
 &rarr; </td>
<td valign="bottom" align="center"><font size="-1"><tt>Alive</tt>
<br />
<tt>Loaded</tt>
<br />
s<sub>1</sub></font></td>
<td align="center"><font size="-1"><tt>wait</tt></font>
<br />
 &rarr;</td>
<td valign="bottom" align="center"><font size="-1"><tt>Alive</tt>
<br />
&not;<tt>Loaded</tt>
<br />
s<sub>2</sub></font></td>
<td align="center"><font size="-1"><tt>shoot</tt></font>
<br />
 &rarr;</td>
<td valign="bottom" align="center"><font size="-1"><tt>Alive</tt>
<br />
&not;<tt>Loaded</tt>
<br />
s<sub>3</sub></font></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Here is a narrative version of this extension. At first, Fred is
alive and the pistol is unloaded. After loading, the pistol is loaded
and Fred remains alive. After waiting, the pistol becomes unloaded and
Fred remains alive. Shooting is then vacuous since the pistol is
unloaded, so finally, after shooting, Fred remains alive and the pistol
remains unloaded.</p>

<p>

The best way to see clearly that this is an extension is to work
through the proof. Less formally, though, you can see that the expected
extension violates just one default: the frame default for
<tt>Alive</tt> is violated when Fred changes state in the last step.
But the anomalous extension also violates only one default: the frame
default for <tt>Loaded</tt> is violated when the pistol spontaneously
becomes unloaded while waiting. So, if you just go by the number of
defaults that are violated, both extensions are equally good.</p>

<p>

The Yale Shooting Anomaly represents a major obstacle in developing
a theory of predictive reasoning. A plausible, well-motivated logical
solution to the Frame Problem runs afoul of a simple, crisp example in
which it clearly delivers the wrong results. Naturally, the literature
concerning the Yale Shooting Problem is extensive. Surveys of some of
this work, with bibliographical references, can be found in
 <a href="#shanahan:1997a">Shanahan 1997</a>;
 <a href="#morgenstern:1996a">Morgenstern 1996</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="FP-frameworks">4.6 Some Emergent Frameworks</a></h3>

<p>

Many formalisms have been proposed to deal with the problems
surveyed in the previous section. Some are more or less neglected
today. Several are still advocated and defended by leading experts;
some of these are associated with research groups who are not only
interested in developments of logical theory, but in applications in
planning and cognitive robotics.</p>

<p>

The leading approaches provide solutions to the main problems
mentioned in
 <a href="#inertia">Section 4.5</a>,
 and to many of the
scenarios designed to test and illustrate theories of reasoning about
action and change. It is commonly agreed that good solutions need to be
generalizable to more complex cases than the early planning formalisms,
and that in particular the solutions they offer should be deployable
even when continuous time, concurrent actions, and various kinds of
ignorance are allowed. Also, it is generally agreed that the formalisms
should support several kinds of reasoning, and, in particular, not only
prediction and plan verification but <em>retrodiction</em>, i.e.,
construction of a sequence of states and actions from partial
information, presented in narrative form.</p>

<p>

We describe four approaches here: (1) Features and fluents
(Sandewall), (2) Motivated Action Theory (Morgenstern and Stein), (3)
State Minimization in the Event Calculus (Shanahan) and (4) Causal
Theories (Lifschitz and others). The accounts of the first three in
what follows will be fairly brief; fortunately, each approach is well
documented in a single reference. The fourth approach is most likely
to be interesting to philosophers and to contain elements that will be
of lasting importance regardless of future developments in this
area.</p>

<h4><a name="4.6.1">4.6.1 Features and fluents</a></h4>

<p>

This approach, described in
 <a href="#sandewall:1994a">Sandewall 1994</a>,
 uses preference semantics as a way to organize nonmonotonic
solutions to the problems of reasoning about action and change. Rather
than introducing a single logical framework, Sandewall considers a
number of temporal logics, including ones that use discrete,
continuous, and branching time. The properties of the logics are
systematically tested against a large suite of test scenarios. </p>

<h4><a name="4.6.2">4.6.2 Motivated Action Theory</a></h4>

<p>

This theory grew out of direct consideration of the problems in
temporal reasoning described above in
 <a href="#inertia">Section 4.5</a>,
 and especially the Yale Shooting Scenario. In
 <a href="#morgenstern-stein:1994a">Morgenstern &amp; Stein 1994</a>,
Morgenstern and Stein seek to find a general, intuitively motivated
logical framework that solves the difficulties. They settle on the idea
that unmotivated actions are to be minimized, where an action
(&ldquo;actions&rdquo; construed generally enough to include any change) can be
motivated directly, e.g. by an axiom, or indirectly, through chains of
motivations. The key technical idea of the paper is a (rather
complicated) definition of motivation in an interval-based temporal
logic. In
 <a href="#morgenstern:1996a">Morgenstern 1996</a>,
Morgenstern presents a summary of the theory, along with reasons for
rejecting its causal rivals. The most important of these reasons is
that these theories, based on the Situation Calculus, do not appear to
generalize to cases allowing for concurrency and ignorance. She also
cites the failure of early causal theories to deal with retrodiction. </p>

<h4><a name="4.6.3">4.6.3 State-Based Minimization in the Event Calculus</a></h4>

<p>

In
 <a href="#baker_ab:1989a">Baker 1989</a>,
 Andrew Baker presented a
solution to the version of the Yale Shooting problem in the Situation
Calculus, using a circumscriptive inertial axiom. The very brief
account of circumscription above in
 <a href="#nm">Section 3</a>
indicated that circumscription uses preferred models in which the
extensions of certain predicates are minimized. In the course of this
minimization, a set of parameters (including, of course, the predicates
to be minimized) is allowed to vary; the rest are held constant. Which
parameters vary and which are held constant is determined by the
application. </p>

<p>

In the earliest circumscriptive solutions to the Frame Problem, the
inertial rule <strong>CIR</strong> is stated using an abnormality
predicate.</p>

<blockquote><strong>CIR</strong> <br />
&forall;f&forall;s&forall;a[&not;<em>Ab</em>(f,a,s) &rarr;
[<em>Holds</em>(f,s) &harr;
<em>Holds</em>(f,R<small>ESULT</small>(a,s))]]
</blockquote>

<p>

This axiom uses a biconditional, so that it can be used for
retrodiction; this is typical of the more recent formulations of common
sense inertia. In circumscribing, the abnormality predicate is
minimized while the <em>Holds</em> predicate is allowed to vary and all
other parameters are fixed. This formalization succumbs to the Yale
Shooting Anomaly in much the same way that default logic does.
(Circumscription does not involve multiple extensions, so the problem
emerges as the nonderivability of the conclusion that Fred is alive
after the occurrence of the shooting.)</p>

<p>

In Baker&rsquo;s reformulation of the problem, separate axioms ensure the
existence of a situation corresponding to each Boolean combination of
fluents, and the R<small>ESULT</small> function is allowed to vary,
while the <em>Holds</em> predicate is held constant. In this setting,
the R<small>ESULT</small> function needs to be specified for
&ldquo;counterfactual&rdquo;actions&mdash;in particular, for shooting as well as
for waiting in the Yale Shooting Anomaly. It is this feature that
eliminates the incorrect model for that scenario; for details, see
 <a href="#baker_ab:1989a">Baker 1989</a>
 and
 <a href="#shanahan:1997a">Shanahan 1997</a>,
 Chapter 6.</p>

<p>

This idea, which Shanahan calls &ldquo;State-Based Minimization,&rdquo; is
developed and extended in
 <a href="#shanahan:1997a">Shanahan 1997</a>,
in the context of a temporal logic deriving from the Event Calculus of
Kowalski and Sergot; see
 <a href="#kowalski-sergot:1986a">Kowalski &amp; Sergot 1986</a>.
 Shanahan&rsquo;s formalism has the advantage of being
closely connected to implementations using logic programming.</p>

<h4><a name="4.6.4">4.6.4 Causal Theories</a></h4>

<p>

Recall that in the anomalous model of the Yale Shooting Scenario the
gun becomes unloaded after the performance of the <tt>wait</tt> action,
an action which has no conventional effects&mdash;the unloading, then,
is uncaused. In the context of a nonmonotonic logic&mdash;and without
such a logic, the Yale Shooting Anomaly would not arise&mdash;it is
very natural to formalize this by treating uncaused eventualities as
abnormalities to be minimized. </p>

<p>

This strategy was pursued by Hector Geffner in
 <a href="#geffner:1992c">Geffner 1992</a>
 <a href="#geffner:1990a">1990</a>,
 where he formalizes this simple causal
solution to the Yale Shooting Anomaly. But the solution is presented in
the context of an ambitious general project in nonmonotonic logic that
not only develops properties of the preferred model approach and shows
how to apply it to a number of reasoning problems, but that relates
nonmonotonic logic to probabilities, using ideas deriving from
 <a href="#adams_ew:1975a">Adams 1975</a>.
 In
 <a href="#geffner:1992c">Geffner 1992</a>,
 the causal theory is sketched;
it is not developed to show its adequacy in dealing with the battery of
problems presented above, and in particular the Ramification Problem is
left untouched.</p>

<p>

The work beginning with
 <a href="#lifschitz:1987c">Lifschitz 1987</a>
 has contributed to a sustained line of research in the causal
approach&mdash;not only by Lifschitz and students of his such as Enrico
Giunchiglia and Hudson Turner, but by researchers at other sites. For

<p>

Here, we briefly describe some of theories developed by the
Texas Action Group, leading up to the causal solution presented in
 <a href="#turner_h:1999a">Turner 1999</a>.
 Turner returns to the ideas
 of
 <a href="#geffner:1992c">Geffner 1992</a>,
 but places them in a simpler
logical setting and applies them to the formalization of more complex
scenarios that illustrate the interactions of causal inertia with other
considerations, especially the Ramification Problem.</p>

<p>

Ramification is induced by the presence of <em>static laws</em>
which relate the direct consequences of actions to other changes. 
Let&rsquo;s use a car-starting scenario to illustrate the difficulties. There
is one action, <em>turn-on</em>, which turns on the ignition; let&rsquo;s
suppose that this action has no preconditions. There is a fluent
<em>Ig</em> tracking whether the ignition is on, a fluent <em>Dead</em>
tracking whether the battery is dead, and a fluent <em>Run</em>
tracking whether the engine is running. A static law says that if the
ignition is on and the battery isn&rsquo;t dead, the engine is running.
(Let&rsquo;s suppose that every other source of failure has already been
eliminated in this scenario; the only possible reason for not starting
is the battery.) We want to consider a transition in which
<em>turn-on</em> is performed in a situation in which the ignition is
not on, the battery is not dead, and the car isn&rsquo;t running.</p>

<p>

Of course, we want a planning agent to be able to infer in such a
case that a performance of <em>turn-on</em> will result in a situation
in which the ignition is on, the battery isn&rsquo;t dead, and the engine is
running. But contraposition of laws makes it difficult to devise a
principled solution. Informally, this difficulty is this: we can
conclude by contraposing our only static law that if the ignition is on
and the engine isn&rsquo;t running, then the battery is dead. This law not
only is true in our scenario, but would be used to explain a failed
attempt to start the car. But if we allow it to be used for prediction,
then it is hard to see how to rule out an outcome of <em>turn-on</em>
in which the ignition is on, the battery is dead, and the engine isn&rsquo;t
running. The battery is dead in this outcome because of causal inertia.
The engine isn&rsquo;t running because of the contraposed causal law.</p>

<p>

Readers who want to explore in some detail the
problems of embedding a nonmonotonic solution to the Frame Problem in
relatively expressive action languages  can look to
 <a href="#gelfond-lifschitz:1998a">Gelfond &amp; Lifschitz 1998</a>.
This paper presents an
increasingly powerful and sophisticated series of action languages.
Their language incorporates an <em>ad hoc</em> or at least purely
syntactic solution to the Ramification Problem.</p>

<p>

A theory in language
 <span class="scriptuc">B</span>
 consists of
two sets of axioms:</p>

<ol>
<li>Static laws of the form <em>F</em>&rarr;<em>L</em>, where
<em>L</em> is a literal and <em>F</em> is a conjunction of literals or
is <em>T</em>.</li>

<li>Dynamic laws of the form <em>A</em> <strong>Causes</strong>
<em>L</em> <strong>if</strong> <em>F</em>, where <em>A</em> is an
action term and <em>F</em> is a boolean formula.</li>
</ol>

<p>

Gelfond and Lifschitz impose a weak closure condition on static
laws: where <em>s</em> is a set of literals, <em>s</em> is
restricted-closed with respect to a
 <span class="scriptuc">B</span> theory
 <em>T</em>,
 <em>R</em><span class="scriptuc">B</span><em>Cl</em><sub><em>T</em></sub>(<em>s</em>)
if and only
if every literal that would be added by starting with <em>s</em> and
forward-chaining through the static laws of
 <span class="scriptuc">B</span>
 is already in <em>s</em>. In other words:</p>

<blockquote><em>R</em><span class="scriptuc">B</span><em>Cl</em><sub><em>T</em></sub>(<em>s</em>) 
iff for all
static laws <em>F</em>&rarr;<em>L</em> of <em>T</em>, if <em>s</em>
entails <em>F</em> then <em>L</em>&isin;<em>s</em>.</blockquote>

<p>

The closure operation induced by this condition is used in defining
R<small>ESULT</small>(a,s) for the language
 <span class="scriptuc">B</span>.
 Of course, this solution treats logically equivalent
static laws differently; for instance, a theory whose only static law
is [<em>P</em>&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;&not;<em>Q</em>] &rarr;<em>R</em> will in general
determine a very different R<small>ESULT</small> function than one
whose only static law is [<em>P</em>&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;&not;<em>R</em>] &rarr;<em>Q</em>.</p>

<p>

This has some somewhat counterintuitive effects. In the car-starting
scenario, Gelfond and Lifschitz&rsquo; language
 <span class="scriptuc">B</span>
 indeed yields the desired conclusion that the car will
start when there is one dynamic law,</p>

<blockquote>
<em>turn-on</em>&nbsp;<strong>Causes</strong>&nbsp;<em>Ig</em>&nbsp;<strong>
if</strong>&nbsp;T,</blockquote>

<p>

when the only static law is </p>

<blockquote>[<em>Ig</em>&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;&not;<em>Dead</em>] &rarr; <em>Run</em>,</blockquote>

<p>

when the initial state is <em>s</em> = {&not;<em>Ig</em>,
&not;<em>Dead</em>, &not;<em>Run</em>}, and when the action
<em>turn-on</em> is performed. </p>

<p>

However, if we add a true static law saying that if the ignition is
on and the engine isn&rsquo;t running the battery is dead, we get an anomaly.
With the addition of this law, there is a model in which preserving the
fact that the car is not running makes the battery become dead when the
ignition is turned on.</p>

<p>

If the two static laws,
[<em>Ig</em>&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;&not;<em>Dead</em>] &rarr; <em>Run</em>
and [<em>Ig</em>&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;&not;<em>Run</em>]
&rarr; <em>Dead</em>, are reformulated using causal language, the
former sounds correct, while the second is distinctly problematic:
compare</p>

<blockquote>If the battery isn&rsquo;t dead, the ignition&rsquo;s being on will
cause the engine to run.</blockquote>

<p>

with </p>

<blockquote>If the engine isn&rsquo;t running, the ignition&rsquo;s being on will
cause the battery to be dead.</blockquote>

<p>

This makes it very plausible to suppose that the source of the
problem is a representation of underlying causal information in action
language
 <span class="scriptuc">B</span>
 that is somehow
inadequate.</p>

<p>

Gelfond and Lifschitz go on to describe another action
 language,
 <span class="scriptuc">C</span>, which invokes an explicit notion of
causality&mdash;motivated, in all likelihood, in part by the need to provide a
more principled solution to the problem. Instead of describing that
language, we now discuss the similar theory of
 <a href="#turner_h:1999a">Turner 1999</a>.</p>

<p>

Turner&rsquo;s idea is to treat <tt>Caused</tt> as a modal operator
<small>[</small>&nbsp;<em>c</em>&nbsp;<small>]</small>, making this the
basis of a modal nonmonotonic logic. In the preferred models of this
logic, the caused propositions coincide with the propositions that are
true, and this must be the only possibility consistent with the
extensional part of the model. To make this more explicit, recall that
in the possible worlds interpretation of <strong>S5</strong>, it is
possible to identify possible worlds with <em>state descriptions</em>,
which we can represent as sets <em>I</em> of literals (atomic formulas
and their negations). Making this identification, then, we can think of
a model as a pair &lt;<em>I</em>, <em>S</em>&gt;, where <em>S</em> is a
set of interpretations (complete, consistent sets of literals)
including <em>I</em>. The modal operator
<small>[</small>&nbsp;<em>c</em>&nbsp;<small>]</small> is given the
standard semantics: where <em>S</em> is a set of interpretations and
where <em>I</em>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;<em>S</em>, 
<em>S</em>&nbsp;&#8872;<sub><em>I</em></sub>&nbsp;<small>[</small>&nbsp;<em>c</em>&nbsp;<small>
]</small>&nbsp;<em>A</em> if and only if 
<em>S</em>&nbsp;&#8872;<sub><em>I&prime;</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>A</em> for all
<em>I&prime;</em>&nbsp;&isin;<em>S</em>. &lt;<em>I</em>, <em>S</em>&gt;
<em>satisfies</em> a set of formulas <em>T</em> if and only if
<em>S</em>&nbsp;&#8872;<sub><em>I</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>A</em> for all
<em>A</em>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;<em>T</em>.</p>

<p>

Turner&rsquo;s preferred models of <em>T</em> are the pairs
&lt;<em>I</em>, <em>S</em>&gt; such that: (1) &lt;<em>I</em>,
<em>S</em>&gt; satisfies <em>T</em>, (2) <em>S</em> = {<em>I</em>}, and
(3) &lt;<em>I</em>, <em>S</em>&gt; is the unique interpretation
&lt;<em>I&prime;</em>, <em>S&prime;</em>&gt; meeting conditions (1) and
(2) with <em>I&prime;</em> = <em>I</em>. Condition (2) guarantees the
&ldquo;universality of causation&rdquo;; it validates <em>A</em> &harr;
<small>[</small>&nbsp;<em>c</em>&nbsp;<small>]</small><em>A</em>.
Condition (3) &ldquo;grounds&rdquo; causality in noncausal information (in the
models in which we are interested, this will be information about the
occurrence of events), in the strongest sense: it is uniquely
determined by this information.</p>

<p>

Although it is not evident from the formulation, Turner&rsquo;s account of
preferred models is related to the constructions of more general
nonmonotonic logics, such as default logic. Consult
 <a href="#turner_h:1999a">Turner 1999</a>
 for details.</p>

<p>

The axioms that specify the effects of actions treat these effects
as caused; for instance, the axiom schema for loading would read as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="6">
<tr>
<td><strong>Causal-Load</strong></td>
<td>
<small>[</small>&nbsp;<em>c</em>&nbsp;<small>]</small><em>Holds</em>(<tt>load</tt>,
 R<small>ESULT</small>(<tt>load</tt>, s))<sup>[<a id="ref-33" href="notes.html#note-33">33</a>]</sup></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Ramifications of the immediate effects of actions are also treated as
caused. And the nonmonotonic inertial axiom schemata take the form </p>

<p>
[[<small>[</small>&thinsp;<em>c</em>&thinsp;<small>]</small><em>Holds</em>(f,s)]
 &and;
<em>Holds</em>(f,R<small>ESULT</small>(<em>a</em>,s))] &rarr;
<small>[</small>&thinsp;<em>c</em>&thinsp;<small>]</small><em>Holds</em>(f,R<small>
ESULT</small>(<em>a</em>,s))</p>

<p>
and </p>

<p>
[[<small>[</small>&thinsp;<em>c</em>&thinsp;<small>]</small>&not;<em>Holds</em>(f,s)]
 &and;
&not;<em>Holds</em>(f,R<small>ESULT</small>(<em>a</em>,s))] &rarr; <br />
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  <small>[</small>&thinsp;<em>c</em>&thinsp;<small>]</small>&not;<em>Holds</em>(f,R<small>ESULT</small>(<em>a</em>,s)).
</p>

<p>

Thus, a true proposition can be caused either because it is the direct
or indirect effect of an action, or because it involves the persistence
of a caused proposition. Initial conditions are also considered to be
caused, by stipulation. </p>

<p>

To illustrate the workings of this approach, let&rsquo;s consider the
simplest case of inertia: we have a language with just one constant
denoting a fluent, f, and one action-denoting constant, <tt>wait</tt>.
As in the Yale Shooting Problem, there are no axioms for <tt>wait</tt>;
this action can always be performed and has no associated effects. Let
<em>s</em><sub>1</sub> be R<small>ESULT</small>(<tt>wait</tt>,s
<sub>0</sub>). The theory <em>T</em> contains an initial condition for
f, <em>Holds</em>(f,s<sub>0</sub>) and a statement that the initial
condition is caused,
<small>[</small>&thinsp;<em>c</em>&thinsp;<small>]</small><em>&thinsp;Holds</em>(f,s<sub>
0</sub>), as well as the inertial schemata.</p>

<p>

Two models of <em>T</em> satisfy conditions (1) and (2):</p>

<blockquote>
<em>M</em><sub>1</sub> =
&lt;<em>I</em><sub>1</sub>,{<em>I</em><sub>1</sub>}&gt; and
<em>M</em><sub>2</sub> =
&lt;<em>I</em><sub>2</sub>,{<em>I</em><sub>2</sub>}&gt;,
</blockquote>

<p>where
<em>I</em><sub>1</sub> = {<em>Holds</em>(f,s<sub>0</sub>),
<em>Holds</em>(f,s<sub>1</sub>)} and <em>I</em><sub>2</sub> =
{<em>Holds</em>(f,s<sub>0</sub>),
&not;<em>Holds</em>(f,s<sub>1</sub>)}.</p>

<p>

<em>M</em><sub>1</sub> is the intended model, in which nothing
changes. It satisfies Condition (3), since if
&lt;<em>I</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>S</em>&gt; satisfies <em>T</em> it
satisfies
<small>[</small>&thinsp;<em>c</em>&thinsp;<small>]</small><em>Holds</em>(f,s<sub>
1</sub>) by the inertial axiom</p>

<blockquote>
[[<small>[</small>&thinsp;<em>c</em>&thinsp;<small>]</small><em>Holds</em>(f,s)]
 &and; <em>Holds</em>(f,s<sub>1</sub>)] &rarr;
<small>[</small>&thinsp;<em>c</em>&thinsp;<small>]</small><em>Holds</em>(f,s<sub>
1</sub>).</blockquote>

<p>

Therefore, <em>S</em> = {<em>I</em><sub>1</sub>}.</p>

<p>

<em>M</em><sub>2</sub> is an anomalous model, in which the fluent
ceases spontaneously. This model does not satisfy Condition (3), since
<em>M</em><sub>3</sub> =
&lt;<em>I</em><sub>2</sub>,{<em>I</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>I</em><sub>2</sub>}&gt; also satisfies <em>T</em>; in particular,
it satisfies the inertial axiom for f because it fails to satisfy
<em>Holds</em>(f,s<sub>1</sub>). So, while <em>M</em><sub>1</sub> is a
preferred model, <em>M</em><sub>2</sub> is not.</p>

<p>

Turner&rsquo;s approach avoids the problem of contraposition by giving
causal relations the form</p>

<blockquote>[B<small>ACKGROUND-</small>C<small>ONDITIONS</small>
 &and;
 C<small>AUSE</small>] &rarr;
<small>[</small>&thinsp;<em>c</em>&thinsp;<small>]</small>E<small>FFECT</small>.</blockquote>

<p>

When contraposed, this becomes </p>

<blockquote>[C<small>AUSE</small>
 &and;
&not;<small>[</small>&thinsp;<em>c</em>&thinsp;<small>]</small>
E<small>FFECT</small>] &rarr; &not;B<small>ACKGROUND-</small>
C<small>ONDITIONS</small>,</blockquote>

<p>

which does not have the form of a causal law. This solution is less
than fully satisfactory at solving the intuitive difficulties, because
Turner&rsquo;s semantics seems intuitively to validate formulas such as</p>

<blockquote>
<small>[</small>&thinsp;<em>c</em>&thinsp;<small>]</small>[[&not;<em>Dead</em>
 &and; <em>Ig</em>] &rarr;
<em>Run</em>],</blockquote>

<p>

and in this form, contraposition would be restored. The task of
clarifying the foundations of causal theories of action and change may
not yet be complete.</p>

<p>

But the apparent usefulness of a &ldquo;principle of universal causality&rdquo;
in accounting for a range of problems in qualitative common sense
reasoning will be tantalizing to philosophers. And the causal theory,
as initiated by Geffner and developed by Turner, has many interesting
detailed features. For instance, while philosophical work on causality
has concentrated on the causal relation, this work in logical AI shows
that a great deal can be done by using only a nonrelational causal
predicate.</p>

<p>

The relation between causality and conditionals can be explored and
exploited in various ways.  <a href="#lewis_dk:1977a">Lewis 1977</a>
undertakes to account for causality in terms of conditionals.  In the
reverse direction, <a href="#lent-thomason:2015a">Lent and Thomason 2015</a>
uses Turner&rsquo;s causal approach to construct models for conditional logics,
in the restricted case where the antecedent is the conjunction of an
action expression and simple situational conditions.  The motivation for
this idea is than an explicit solution to the frame problem automatically
provides a semantics for such conditionals.</p>

<p>

Morgenstern&rsquo;s two chief criticisms of the causal approach to
reasoning about actions are that it does not give an adequate account
of explanation<sup>[<a id="ref-34" href="notes.html#note-34">34</a>]</sup>
 and that the logical context in
which it works (the Situation Calculus) is limited. As work on the
approach continues, progress is being made in these areas. But the
constraints that a successful logic of action and change must meet are
so complex that it seems to be a reasonable research methodology to
concentrate initially on a restricted logical setting.</p>

<p>

For another approach to nonmonotonic causal reasoning, based on
input-output logics (<a href="#makinson-vandertorre:2000a">Makinson
&amp; van der Torre 2000</a>), see <a href="#bochman:2004b">Bochman
2004</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="Steedman">4.7 Action Formalisms and Natural Language</a></h3>

<p>

Although for many AI logicists, the goal of action formalisms is to
illuminate an important aspect of common sense reasoning, most of their
research is uninformed by an important source of insights into the
common sense view of time&mdash;namely, natural language. Linguists
concerned with the semantics of temporal constructions in natural
language, like the AI community, have begun with ideas from
philosophical logic but have discovered that these ideas need to be
modified in order to deal with the phenomena. A chief discovery of the
AI logicists has been the importance of actions and their relation to
change. Similarly, an important discovery of the &ldquo;natural language
logicists&rdquo; has been the importance of different kinds of events
(including structured composite events) in interpreting natural
language. From work such as this the idea of &ldquo;natural language
metaphysics&rdquo; (see, for instance,
 <a href="#bach_e:1989a">Bach 1989</a>)
has emerged. </p>

<p>

The goal of articulating a logical framework tailored to a
representational system that is motivated by systematic evidence about
meanings in natural languages is not acknowledged by all linguistic
semanticists. Nevertheless, it is a significant theme in the linguistic
literature. This goal is remarkably similar to those of the common
sense logicists, but the research methodology is entirely
different.</p>

<p>

Can the insights of these separate traditions be reconciled and
unified? Is it possible to constrain theories of temporal
representations and reasoning with the insights and research
methodologies of both traditions? In
 <a href="#steedman:1995a">Steedman 1995</a>
 (and
 <a href="#steedman:2000">2000</a>,
 listed in the Other
Internet Resources Section), these important questions are addressed,
and a theory is developed that extends action formalisms like the
Situation Calculus, and that incorporates many of the insights from
linguistic semantics. The project reported in
 <a href="#steedman:2000">Steedman 2000</a>
 is still incomplete, but the
results reported there make a convincing case that the event-based
ideas from linguistics can be fruitfully combined with the
action-centered formalisms in the AI literature. The possibility of
this unification is one of the most exciting logical developments in
this area, bringing together as it does two independent descendants of
the earlier work in the logic of time.</p>

<h2><a name="cause">5. Causal Reasoning</a></h2>

<p>

In
 <a href="#FP-frameworks">Section 4.6</a>,
 we traced the reasons
for the development of theories incorporating causality in work on
reasoning about action and change. This is not the only area of AI in
which causality has emerged. Causality figures in qualitative reasoning
about devices; for Herbert Simon&rsquo;s important work in this area, which
goes back to the 1950s, see
 <a href="#simon_ha:1952a">Simon 1952</a>;
 <a href="#simon_ha:1977a">1977</a>;
 <a href="#iwasaki-simon:1986a">Iwasaki &amp; Simon 1986</a>.
 Both these
traditions are important. But the most robust and highly developed
program in AI relating to causality is that of Judea Pearl and his
students and associates, which derives from statistical techniques
known as <em>structural equation models</em>.  
<a href="#halpern-pearl:2001a">Halpern and Pearl 2001</a> introduced
the idea that causal relations among events could be inferred from
these models: Bayesian belief networks could be interpreted as 
causal networks.</p>

<p>

Pearl&rsquo;s program has developed into a far-reaching campaign to
rehabilitate causality in statistical thinking. We shall not discuss this
topic here. For one thing, this survey omits probabilistic reasoning in
AI. For another, Pearl&rsquo;s views on causality are systematically and
comprehensively presented in a recent book-length study,
 <a href="#pearl:2000a">Pearl 2000</a>.</p>

<p>

But it is important to point out that the work on causality discussed
 in
 <a href="#FP-frameworks">Section 4.6</a>
 and Pearl&rsquo;s ideas do share
some common themes. On both approaches: <em>action</em> is central for
causality. Also there is a focus on causality as a tool in reasoning
that is necessitated in part by limited resources. Another important
theme is the deployment and systematic study of formalisms in which
causality is related to other constructs (in particular, to probability
and to qualitative change) and a variety of realistic reasoning
problems are addressed.</p>

<p>

These commonalities provide reason to hope that we will see a
science of causality emerging from the AI research, unifying the
contributions of the probabilistic, the qualitative physics, and the
nonmonotonic traditions, and illuminating the various phases of causal
reasoning.</p>

<p>

 A recent landmark in this direction is 
<a href="#halpern_jy:2016a">Halpern 2016</a>, which develops and
applies the general theory of event causality that arises from the
causal network approach.  Although Halpern is a computer scientist,  a
large part of this book is philosophical, exploring notions such
as blame and explanation.  But the book also explores practical
applications of the approach that would not occur to philosophers,
in areas such as software fault diagnosis.</p>


<p>

Whether you take causality to be a fundamental construct in natural
science, or a fundamental common sense phenomenon, depends on whether
you have in mind an idealized nature described by differential
equations or you have in mind the view of nature we have to take in
order to act, either in everyday situations, or for that matter in
designing experiments in the laboratory. The fact that, as Bertrand
Russell noted (see
 <a href="#russell_b:1957a">Russell 1957</a>),
causality is not to be found as a theoretical primitive in contemporary
physical theories is at odds with its seeming importance in so many
familiar areas of reasoning. The rigorous theories emerging in AI that
are beginning to illuminate the workings of causality are important not
only in themselves, but in their potentiality to illuminate wider
philosophical issues.</p>

<h2><a name="space">6. Spatial Reasoning</a></h2>

<p>

The precomputational literature in philosophical logic relating to
spatial reasoning is very sparse in relation, for instance, to the
temporal literature. The need to support computational reasoning about
space, however, in application areas such as motion planning and
manipulation in physical space, the indexing and retrieval of images,
geographic information systems, diagrammatic reasoning, and the design
of high-level graphics programs has led to new interest in spatial
representations and spatial reasoning. Of course, the geometrical
tradition provides an exceptionally strong mathematical resource for
this enterprise. But as in many other AI-related areas, it is not clear
that the available mathematical theories are appropriate for informing
these applications, and many computer scientists have felt it
worthwhile to develop new foundations. Some of this work is closely
related to the research in qualitative reasoning mentioned above in
 <a href="#commonsense">Section 2.2</a>,
 and in some cases has been carried
out by the same individuals. </p>

<p>

The literature in spatial reasoning is extensive; for references to
some areas not discussed here, see

 and
 <a href="#kosslyn:1990a">Kosslyn 1990</a>.
 Here, we discuss only one
trend, which is closely connected with parallel work in philosophical
logic.</p>

<p>

Qualitative approaches to space were introduced into the logical
literature early in the twentieth century by Lesniewski; see
 <a href="#lesniewski:1916a">Lesniewski 1916</a>,
 which presents the idea
of a <em>mereology</em>, or qualitative theory of the part-whole
relation between physical individuals. This idea of a logical theory of
relations among regions or the objects that occupy them, which does not
depend on construing regions as sets of points, remained an active area
of philosophical logic, even though it attracted relatively few
researchers. More recent work in the philosophical literature,
especially
 <a href="#casati-varzi:1999a">Casati &amp; Varzi 1999</a>,
 <a href="#simons_p:1987a">Simons 1987</a>,
 <a href="#casati-varzi:1996a">Casati &amp; Varzi 1996</a>,
 <a href="#clarke_b:1981a">Clarke 1981</a>,
 <a href="#clarke_b:1985a">Clarke 1985</a>,
 as directly influential on
current computational work.</p>

<p>

The Regional Connection Calculus (RCC), developed by computer
scientists at the University of Leeds, is based on a primitive
<em>C</em> relating regions of space: the intended interpretation of
<em>C</em>(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) is that the intersection of the
closures of the values of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> is nonempty.
 (See
 <a href="#cohn_ag-etal:1997a">Cohn <em>et al</em>. 1997</a>,
 <a href="#cohn_ag-:1997a">Cohn 1996</a>)
 for details and references.) One
area of research concerns the definability of shapes in RCC. The extent
of what can be defined with this simple primitive is surprising, but
the technicalities quickly become complex; see, for instance,
 <a href="#gotts:1994a">Gotts 1994</a>,
 <a href="#gotts:1996a">Gotts 1996</a>).
 The work cited in
 <a href="#cohn_ag-etal:1997a">Cohn <em>et al</em>. 1997</a>
 describes constraint propagation techniques and
encodings in intuitionistic propositional logic as ways of supporting
implemented reasoning based on RCC and some of its extensions. More
recent work based on RCC addresses representation and reasoning about
motion, which of course combines spatial and temporal issues; see
 <a href="#wolter-zakharyaschev:2000a">Wolter &amp; Zakharyaschev 2000</a>).

with references to other approaches, see
 <a href="#galton:1997a">Galton 1997</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="knowledge">7. Reasoning about Knowledge</a></h2>

<p>

Epistemic logic is another area in which logic in computer science
have been influenced by philosophical logic. The classical source for
epistemic logic is
 <a href="#hintikka:1962a">Hintikka 1962</a>,
 in which Jaakko Hintikka
showed that a modal approach to single-agent epistemic attitudes could
be informative and rewarding. This work discusses at length the
question of exactly which constraints are appropriate for knowledge and
belief, when these attitudes are viewed as explicated by a model
theoretic relation over possible worlds; in both cases, Hintikka argues
for <strong>S4</strong> type operators. </p>

<p>

In several papers (including
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1979c1">McCarthy 1979</a>),
 John McCarthy has recommended an approach to formalizing
knowledge that uses first-order logic, but that quantifies explicitly
over such things as individual concepts. In this section, we discuss
the approach taken by most computer scientists, who, unlike McCarthy,
use a modal language to formalize propositional attitudes.</p>

<p>

The logical aspects of modal epistemic logic were not significantly
developed after Hintikka&rsquo;s 1962 presentation; instead, the
philosophical literature (which is not extensive, compared with many
other topics in the area) concentrates on the issue of
<em>hyperintensionality</em>, or closure of epistemic attitudes under
logical consequence. This topic is especially challenging, turning out
to be closely related to the semantic paradoxes, and the philosophical
literature is inconclusive. Intuitions seem to conflict, and it is
difficult to find ways to model the important phenomena using logical
techniques.<sup>[<a id="ref-35" href="notes.html#note-35">35</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

 <a href="#fagin-etal:1984b">Fagin <em>et al</em>. 1984</a>
 begins a
tradition in computational logic that revives the modal approach to
epistemic logic, developing generalized logical foundations and
applications that had not occurred to the philosophers. The technical
idea is to simplify the modality, using <strong>S5</strong> (or deontic
<strong>S5</strong> for belief), but to introduce multiple agents, and
to concentrate on reasoning having to do with agents&rsquo; attitudes about
one another&rsquo;s attitudes. Such logics have direct applications in the
analysis of <em>distributed systems</em>, dynamic systems in which
change is effected by message actions, which change the knowledge of
agents according to rules determined by a <em>communications
protocol</em>.</p>

<p>

As such, this work belongs to a separate area of computer science,
but one that overlaps to some extent with AI. Later, this work has
interacted with a research tradition in economics that is concerned
with the role of knowledge in games and bargaining; see, for
 instance,
 <a href="#geanakopolos:1994b">Geanakopolos 1994</a>;
 <a href="#osborne_mj-rubenstein:1994a">Osborne &amp; Rubenstein 1994</a>
[Chapter&nbsp;5].</p>

<p>

For some reason, the multi-agent case did not occur to philosophical
logicians.<sup>[<a id="ref-36" href="notes.html#note-36">36</a>]</sup>
 This is another example of the way
in which need for an application (in this case, the need for a theory
of distributed systems) provided the inspiration for an important
logical development. The logical details are extensively and systematically 
recorded in
 <a href="#fagin-etal:1995b">Fagin <em>et al</em>. 1995</a>;
 this is
essential reading for anyone seriously interested in this topic.</p>

<p>

Much of the interdisciplinary work in applications of the logic of
knowledge is reported in the proceedings of a series of conferences
initiated in 1986 with
 <a href="#halpern:1986c">Halpern 1986</a>.
 These
conferences record one of the most successful collaborations of
philosophers with logicians in Computer Science, although the group of
involved philosophers has been relatively small. The focus of the
conferences has gradually shifted from Computer Science to
Economics.</p>

<p>

AI applications deal with with knowledge in the form of stored
representations, and the tradition in AI with which we are concerned
here thinks of reasoning as the manipulation of symbolic
representations. Also, it is mainly due to AI that the problem of
limited rationality has become a topic of serious interest, providing a
counterbalance to the idealizations of philosophy and
economics.<sup>[<a id="ref-37" href="notes.html#note-37">37</a>]</sup>
 So you would think that a logical
model of propositional attitudes that is committed to closure under
logical consequence would be highly unpopular in AI. But this is not
so; the possible worlds approach to attitudes is not only the leading
theory in the areas discussed in
 <a href="#fagin-etal:1995b">Fagin <em>et al</em>. 1995</a>,
 but has even been advocated in robotics
applications; see
 <a href="#rosenschein_sj-kaelbling:1995a">Rosenschein &amp; Kaelbling 1995</a>;
 <a href="#rosenschein_sj:1989a">Rosenschein 1989</a>.
 Nevertheless, the issue of hyperintensionality has been
investigated in the AI literature; see
 <a href="#perlis:1985a">Perlis 1985</a>;
 <a href="#konolige:1986a">Konolige 1986</a>;
 <a href="#lakemeyer:1994a">Lakemeyer 1997</a>;
 <a href="#levesque:1984b">Levesque 1984</a>).
 Though there are some new
positive results here, the AI work in this area has, for the most
part, been as inconclusive as that in philosophy.</p>

<p>

The philosophical literature on a related topic, the logic of
perception, has not been extensive; the main reference is
 <a href="#hintikka:1970e">Hintikka 1970</a>.<sup>[<a id="ref-38" href="notes.html#note-38">38</a>]</sup>
 But sensation is
addressed in recent work in the AI literature which is concerned with
developing logical frameworks for general-purpose applications in
robotics. The main idea in this area is to add sensing actions to the
repertoire of a planning formalism of the sort discussed in
 <a href="#ac">Section 4</a>.
 The earliest work in this area was carried
out in the 1980s by Robert Moore; see
 <a href="#moore_rc:1995a">Moore 1995b</a>;

<h2><a name="cs">8. Towards a Formalization of Common Sense</a></h2>

<p>
John McCarthy&rsquo;s explicit long-term goal&mdash;the
formalization of common sense knowledge&mdash;has been adopted and
pursued by a relatively small, but active, subcommunity of AI
researchers.  A larger group (those involved in knowledge
representation, cognitive robotics, and qualitative physics) can be
considered to work on specialized projects that support the larger
goal.  Anything like a formalization of common sense is so far from
being accomplished that&mdash;if it is achievable at all&mdash;it is
not even possible to estimate when we could expect the task to be
completed.  However, since 2001 (the date of a symposium on common
sense reasoning held at The Courant Institute&mdash;see
 <a href="#davis:2001">The Common Sense 2001 Homepage</a>) something like
a cooperative, sustained effort in this direction has begun to
emerge.  This effort is yielding a better sense of how to develop a
workable methodology for formalizing common sense, and of how to
divide the larger problem up into more manageable parts.  Many of the
papers presented at this conference were presented in expanded form
in 2004 in an issue of <em>Artificial Intelligence</em>.  The
introduction to this issue, <a href="#davis_e-morgenstern:2004a">
Davis &amp; Morgenstern 2004</a>, provides a useful survey and
appreciation of the general research area.
	</p>

<p>
This cooperative formalization effort (1) seeks to account for
many areas of knowledge, and at the same time (2) attempts to see how
this formalized knowledge can be brought to bear on moderately
complex common-sense reasoning problems.  The first book-length
treatment of this topic, <a href="#davis_e:1991a">Davis 1991</a>,
divides the general problem into the following subtopics.</p>

<ol>
 <li> Quantities and Measurements</li>
 <li> Time</li>
 <li> Space</li>
 <li> Physics</li>
 <li> Minds</li>
 <li> Plans and Goals</li>
 <li> Society</li>
</ol>

<p>

Several of these topics overlap with concerns of the
qualitative physics and qualitative reasoning community.  Although it
can be hard to tell where common sense ends and physics begins, the
formalization of common sense reasoning can be seen as a more general
formalization project that can draw on a tradition in qualitative
physics that has gone through many years of development and by now is
fairly 
 mature.<sup>[<a id="ref-39" href="notes.html#note-39">39</a>]</sup></p> 

<p>

 And a few of them overlap with
the work on the formalization of planning that was described above in
<a href="#ac">Section 4</a>.  Minds and society, however, are new and
different topics; the former has to do with common sense psychology
and its application in introspective and interpersonal reasoning, and
the latter, of course, should have to do with social and political
knowledge and reasoning, but this is the least-developed area of
formalized common sense knowledge: the chapter on this topic in <a href="#davis_e:1991a">Davis 1991</a> is very brief, and discusses
mutual attitudes and communication.  More recently, Andrew S. Gordon
and Jerry Hobbs have undertaken a large-scale, ambitious
formalization of common-sense psychology.  See, for instance, 
 <a href="#hobbs-gordon_a:2005a">Hobbs &amp; Gordon 2005</a>. 
</p>

	

<p>
A more recent book-length treatment of the formalization of
common sense, 
 <a href="#mueller_et:2006a">Mueller, 2006</a>, follows a similar
pattern.  More than half of the book is devoted to reasoning about
actions and change.  There are short chapters on space and mental
states, and a longer treatment of default reasoning.  Although
logical techniques and formalization methods take center stage in
this book, it also contains material on nonlogical methods and
on implementations related to the  formalizations.</p>

<p>
Even when attempted on a moderate scale, the formalization of
common sense knowledge puts considerable pressure on the resources of
even the most powerful logical systems that were devised for the
formalization of mathematics.  As we tried to show in discussing the
special case of action and planning in <a href="#ac">Section 4</a>,
this pressure may lead us to seek logics that can facilitate the
formalization projects: for instance, nonmonotomic logics and logics
that explicitly represent context.  
	</p>

<p>
When larger-scale formalizations are attempted, other
challenges arise that are similar to those that software engineering
tries to address.  Even fairly small programs and systems of axioms
are difficult to comprehend and can be highly unpredicable, yielding
unexpected consequences and unanticipated interactions.  The creation
and use of larger programs and formalizations raises questions of how
to enable teams of developers to produce coherent results when
modules are integrated, how to maintain and test large systems, and
how to use knowledge sources such as dictionaries and knowledge bases
to automatically generate axioms.  </p>

<p>
You can think of the philosophical methodology of providing
analyses as a collection of attempts to formalize or partially
formalize various common sense notions.  These attempts are far
smaller in scale, less systematic, and more heterogeneous than the
parallel effort that is emerging in AI.  Philosophers have never
chosen a specific domain comparable to the planning domain and
mounted a sustained attempt to formalize it, along with a companion
effort to develop appropriate logics.  And no matter how complex the
notions with which they which they are concerned, philosophers have
never allowed their analyses to grow to the complexity where 
methodological issues arise similar to those that apply to the
development and maintenance of large software systems. </p>

<p>
The techniques emerging in AI are of great potential
significance for philosophy because it is easy to suspect that many
philosophically important phenomena have the sort of complexity that
can only be dealt with by accepting the problems that go along with
developing complex formalizations.  Limitations of the philosophical
methods that were used throughout the twentieth century and are still
in use may make it impossible to produce theories that do justice to
the subject matter.  </p>

<p>
It would therefore be a great mistake for philosophers to
disparage and ignore the large-scale formalizations that are
beginning to emerge in AI because these efforts begin to raise
engineering issues.  It may well be that, although philosophy
requires us to address complex phenomena in a rigorous way, the
traditional philosophical methods are capable of doing justice
to the complexity.  Methods that promise to do this are worth taking
seriously.</p>

	

<p>
Among other methods borrowed from computer science, 
the common sense reasoning community has sought to develop 
suites of &ldquo;benchmark problems&rdquo;.  The idea is to publicize
problems that are difficult but not impossibly difficult, to
encourage the community to create solutions, and compare
the solutions.
</p>

<p>
Probably the best-studied problem to date is Ernest Davis&rsquo;
&ldquo;egg-cracking problem.&rdquo;  This is formulated as follows on the
Common Sense Reasoning Problem webpage.
</p>

 <blockquote>
  A cook is cracking a raw egg against a glass bowl.  Properly 
  performed, the impact of the egg against the edge of the bowl will
  crack the eggshell in half.  Holding the egg over the bowl, the cook
  will separate the two halves of the shell with his fingers, enlarging
  the crack, and the contents of the egg will fall gently into the bowl.
  The end result is that the entire contents of the egg will be in the
  bowl, with the egg unbroken, and that the two halves of the shell are
  in the cook&rsquo;s fingers.
 </blockquote>

 <blockquote>
  <i>Variants:</i>  What happens if: The cook brings the egg to impact
  very quickly?  Very slowly?  The cook lays the egg in the bowl and
  exerts steady pressure with his hand?  The cook, having cracked the
  egg, attempts to peel it off its contents like a hard-boiled egg?
  The bowl is made of looseleaf paper?  Of soft clay?  The bowl is smaller
  than the egg?  The bowl is upside down?  The cook tries this
  procedure with a hard-boiled egg?  With a coconut?  With an
  M&amp;M? <sup>[<a id="ref-40" href="notes.html#note-40">40</a>]</sup>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Along with the problem itself  three solutions are posted:
 <a href="#shanahan:2004a">Shanahan 2004</a>, 
 <a href="#lifschitz:1998b">Lifschitz 1998b</a>,
 and a version of
  <a href="#morgenstern:2001a">Morgenstern 2001</a>.  Comparing the
solutions is instructive: similarities outweigh differences.  All the
authors think of this as a planning problem, and use a versions of
the Situation Calculus or the Event Calculus in the formalization.
Each axiomatization is modular, with, for instance, separate modules
devoted to the relevant geometrical and material properties.  Each
author provides a &ldquo;proof of concept&rdquo; for the formalization by showing
that the axioms support a proof of the correctness of a plan to crack
the egg in the simple case.  None of the authors considers all of
Davis&rsquo; elaborations of the problem, but the axioms are framed with
elaboration in mind and some elaborations are considered.  It isn&rsquo;t
clear whether any of the authors actually implemented the
formalization (for instance, using a theorem prover). </p>

<p>
The egg-cracking case raises the problem of how to evaluate
moderately large formalizations of common sense problems.
Morgenstern and Shanahan express this issue explicitly.  Morgenstern
suggests that the important criteria are (1) Epistemological adequacy
(correspondence to intuitive reasoning, as experienced by people who
engage in it), (2) Faithfulness to the real world, (3) Reusability,
and (4) Elaboration tolerance.  It isn&rsquo;t clear whether the first two
of these criteria are too subjective to be useful.  To these,
Shanahan adds (5) Usability, which probably is presupposed by
Morgenstern&rsquo;s third criterion.
</p>

        

<p>
There is anecdotal evidence that the larger AI community is
somewhat skeptical about such research projects&mdash;or, if not
skeptical, at least puzzled about how to evaluate them.  In
considering these doubts, it is necessary to appreciate the
complexity of these formalization problems, and the preliminary and
tentative status of the research program.  Nevertheless, this
criticism has some legitimacy, the common sense reasoning community
is sensitive to these criticisms, and is working to develop and
refine the methods and criteria for evaluating this work.</p>

<p>
As long as formalization problems remain relatively simple,
we can treat formalization as an art rather than as a discipline with
a well-articulated methodology.  But the trends we&rsquo;ve been
discussing show that formalization of even moderate-sized realistic
common sense reasoning problems is not merely an art.  Just as
programming systems, expert systems and knowledge bases have created
corresponding software engineering disciplines, large-scale
formalization projects require a carefully thought through and tested
methodology.
</p>

<h2><a name="nl">9. Logical Approaches to Natural Language and 
Communication</a></h2>

<p>

Over the last twenty-five years or so, many profound relations have
emerged between logic and grammar. Computational linguistics (or
natural language processing) is a branch of AI, and it is fairly
natural to classify some of these developments under logic and AI. But
many of them also belong to an independent tradition in logical
foundations of linguistics; and in many cases it is hard (and
pointless) to attempt a classification. This sketch will concentrate on
developments that have to do with reasoning about linguistics; other
applications of logic to linguistics are described in
 <a href="#vanbenthem-termeulen:1996a">van Benthem &amp; ter Meulen 1996</a>.</p>
 
<h3><a name="pd">9.1 Parsing and Deduction</a></h3>

<p>

Grammar formalisms&mdash;special-purpose systems for the description
of linguistic systems and subsystems&mdash;can be thought of as logics
designed to axiomatize the association of linguistic structures with
strings of symbols. You might be able to infer from such a system, for
instance, that &lsquo;assignments&rsquo; is the plural form of the
nominalization of the verb &lsquo;assign&rsquo;. So you can look at the
process of <em>parsing</em> a string of words&mdash;of finding the
linguistic structures, if any, that are associated with it&mdash;as a
search for a proof in a certain logical system.</p>

<p>

This approach has been highly successful as an analytic tool. It
makes model-theoretic techniques applicable to linguistic reasoning,
This makes the underlying reasoning problems much more transparent, and
makes it possible to apply many well-developed areas of logic to
grammar formalisms. For more information on these topics, see
 <a href="#buszkowski:1996a">Buszkowski 1996</a>;
 <a href="#shieber:1992a">Shieber 1992</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="feature">9.2 Feature Structure Logic</a></h3>

<p>

The usefulness and scope of logical methods in relation to
linguistics is greatly increased by the development of techniques for
analyzing the way information attaches to linguistic units. It is very
natural to represent the information attaching, say, to a lexical item
in the form of a set of functions (or attributes) that produce values
in some linguistic domain. A pronoun <em>x</em> may have a number, a
person, and a case: if <em>x</em> = &lsquo;we&rsquo; then</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>number(x)</em> = plural,</li>

<li><em>person(x)</em> = first,</li>

<li><em>case(x)</em> = nominative.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>

In more general cases, the values of these functions may themselves be
linguistic units that take on values for certain attributes. </p>

<p>

Allowing these functions to be partial provides a useful
informational representation of the stages of a linguistic parse; much
of the work of parsing involves completing this partial information,
subject to constraints imposed by linguistic agreement conditions.
Feature structures&mdash;sets of identities that serve to evaluate
linguistic features&mdash;have a natural algebraic interpretation, and
there is an elegant treatment of their logic. For more information and
references, see
 <a href="#rounds:1996a">Rounds 1996</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="ld">9.3 Logic and Discourse</a></h3>

<p>

The reasoning associated with discourse is the probably the least
well understood area of computational linguistics. Although logical
techniques do not yet play a major role in discourse, they seem to
offer one of the most promising ways of providing a uniform account of
the many forms of reasoning that are involved in generating and
interpreting language in interactive conversation.</p>

<p>

We  briefly mention three contributions to this area. Building on
the fact that the rules governing conversation are exception-ridden,
Alex Lascarides and Nicholas Asher have developed techniques for
formalizing discourse phenomena based on nonmonotonic logic; see
 <a href="#asher-lascarides:1994a">Asher &amp; Lascarides 1994</a>,
 <a href="#asher-lascarides:1995b2">Asher &amp; Lascarides 1997</a>.
 Jerry
Hobbs and various co-workers look at the inference processes used in
discourse as <em>abductive</em>, and propose to formalize abduction as
a search for a proof in which certain &ldquo;low-cost&rdquo; assumptions may be
made which serve as data or additional axioms for the proof.
 <a href="#hobbs-etal:1993a">Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 1993</a>
 shows how an
impressive range of discourse phenomena can be formalized using this
idea. In practice, this abductive account looks rather similar to that
of Lascarides and Asher, because it involves deploying axioms about
discourse (in the form of Horn clause rules supplemented with weights
giving the assumption costs of premises) that in effect are
nonmonotonic.</p>

<p>

In more recent work, Matthew Stone shows in
 <a href="#stone_m:1998a">Stone 1998</a>
 how modal logic can inform the
complex reasoning involved in natural language generation. Generating a
coherent, appropriately phrased text that usefully performs a
task-oriented communication task is difficult to formalize because it
requires the integration of complex and sophisticated domain
information with discourse planning, user modeling, and linguistic
constraints. Stone shows that modal logic can be used to modularize the
formalization of the information required in this task; he also shows
how modal theorem proving can be used to implement the reasoning.</p>

<h2><a name="TaxRep">10. Taxonomic Representation and Reasoning</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ConBasedClass">10.1 Concept-Based Classification</a></h3>

<p>

Traditionally, the task of representing large amounts of domain
information for general-purpose reasoning has been one of the most
important areas of knowledge representation. Systems that exploit the
intuitive taxonomic organization of domains are useful for this
purpose; taxonomic hierarchies not only help to organize the process of
knowledge acquisition, but provide a useful connection to rule-based
reasoning.<sup>[<a id="ref-41" href="notes.html#note-41">41</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

For domains in which complex definitions are a natural way to
organize information, knowledge engineering services based on
definitions of concepts have been extremely successful. Like
variable-free versions of first-order logic (see, for instance,
 <a href="#quine:1960a">Quine 1960</a>,
 these systems are centered on
concepts or first-order predicates, and provide a number of mechanisms
for their definition. The fundamental algorithm associated with these
<em>taxonomic logics</em> is a classifier which inputs a system of
definitions and outputs the entailment relations between defined and
primitive concepts. For background on these systems, see
 <a href="#woods_wa-schmolze:1992a">Woods &amp; Schmolze 1992</a>
 and
 <a href="#brachman-etal:1991a">Brachman <em>et al</em>. 1991</a>.</p>

<p>

The simplest taxonomic logics can be regarded as subsystems of
first-order logic with complex predicates; but they have been extended
in many ways, and the issues raised by many of these extensions overlap
in many cases with topics in philosophical logic.</p>

<h3><a name="NonmonInher">10.2 Nonmonotonic Inheritance</a></h3>

<p>

Much more complex logical issues arise when the organization of a
domain into hierarchies is allowed to have exceptions. One way to
approach this topic is to explore how to make a taxonomic logic
nonmonotonic; but <em>nonmonotonic inheritance</em> is a topic in its
own right. Although there are strong affinities to nonmonotonic logic,
nonmonotonic logic relies more heavily on graph-based representations
than on traditional logical ideas, and seems to provide a much
finer-grained approach to nonmonotonic reasoning that raises entirely
new issues, and which quickly becomes problematic. For this reason,
systems of nonmonotonic inheritance tend to be expressively weak, and
their relations to the more powerful nonmonotonic logic has never been
fully clarified. For background on this topic, see
 <a href="#thomason_rh:1992a">Thomason 1992</a>,
 <a href="#horty:1994a">Horty 1994</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="context">11. Contextual Reasoning</a></h2>

<p>

In the tradition in philosophical logic dealing with contextual
effects on the interpretation of expressions, as well as in the more
recent tradition in dynamic logic, context is primarily formalized as
an assignment of values to variables, and the language is designed to
make explicit reasoning about context either very limited or outright
impossible.</p>

<p>

Concern in AI about the representation of large and apparently
heterogeneous domains and about the integration of disparate knowledge
sources, as well as interests in formalizing common sense of the sort
discussed in
 <a href="#commonsense">Section 2.2</a>,
 above, have led to
interest in the AI community in formalizing languages that take context
into account more explicitly.</p>

<p>

In
 <a href="#mccarthy_j1:1993b">McCarthy 1993b</a>,
 McCarthy
recommends the study of languages containing a construct</p>

<blockquote><em>ist</em>(<em>c,&phi;</em>),</blockquote>

<p>

where <em>ist</em> is read &ldquo;is-true.&rdquo; This is analogous to the
<em>Holds</em> construct of the situation calculus&mdash;but now
<em>c</em> stands for a context, and &phi; is a possibly complex
propositional representation, which many (including McCarthy) take to
refer to a sentence. </p>

<p>

There are analogies here both to modal logic and to languages with an
explicit truth predicate. But the applications that are envisioned for
a logic of context create opportunities and problems that are in many
ways new.  Work on the logic of context subsequent to McCarthy&rsquo;s
original suggestion, includes 
<a href="#mccarthy_j1-buvac:1995a2">McCarthy &amp;
Buvac 1998</a>, <a href="#guha:1991a">Guha 1991</a>, and some of
the papers in the conference volumes
<a href="#akman-etal:2001a">Akman <em>et al</em>. 2001</a>,
 <a href="#bouquet-etal:1999a">Bouquet <em>et al</em>. 1999</a>.
For extensions of Richard Montague&rsquo;s Intensional Logic motivated by
McCarthy&rsquo;s suggestions, see <a href="#thomason_rh:2003a">Thomason 2003</a>
and <a href="#thomason_rh:2005a">2005</a>.</p>

<p>

For some reason, work on the explicit formalization of context hasn&rsquo;t
been actively pursued by the computational community beyond this point.
Philosophical interest in context, and especially in the interaction
of context with propositional attitudes and modals, continues to be
strong; but the very general logical frameworks for context that 
McCarthy envisioned have yet not been taken up by philosophers.</p>

<h2><a name="p-reas">12. Prospects for a Logical Theory of Practical Reason</a></h2>

<p>

There is reason to hope that the combination of logical
methods with planning applications in AI can enable the development of
a far more comprehensive and adequate theory of practical reasoning
than has heretofore been possible. As with many problems having to do
with common sense reasoning, the scale and complexity of the
formalizations that are required are beyond the traditional techniques
of philosophical logic. However, with computational methods of
implementing and testing the formalizations and with areas such as
cognitive robotics to serve as laboratories for developing and testing
ideas, we can hope to radically advance a problem that has seen little
progress since it was first proposed by Aristotle: the problem of
devising a formalization of practical reasoning that is genuinely
applicable to common sense reasoning problems. </p>

<p>

The classical work in deontic logic that was begun by von Wright
(see
 <a href="#vonwright:1983a">von Wright 1983</a>)
 is one source of
ideas; see
 (<a href="#horty:2001a">Horty 2001</a>,
 <a href="#vandertorre-tan:1997b">van der Torre 1997</a>).
 In fact, as the
more recent work in deontic logic shows, nonmonotonic logic provides a
natural and useful supplement to the classical deontic logic.  One
recent work (<a href="#horty:2012a">Horty 2012</a>) seeks 
to base deontic logic on a prioritized version of Reiter&rsquo;s default logic.
</p> 

<p>

An even more robust account of practical reasoning begins to emerge
when these ideas are supplemented with work on the foundations of
planning and reasoning about action that were discussed in
 <a href="#ac">Section 4</a>,
 above. But this development can be pursued
even further, by extending the formalism to include preferences and
intentions.<sup>[<a id="ref-42" href="notes.html#note-42">42</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Ultimately, what is needed is a model of an intelligent reasoning
and acting agent. Developing such a model need not be entirely a matter
of logic, but according to one school of thought, logic has a central
role to play in it; see, for instance,
 <a href="#baral-gelfond:2000a">Baral &amp; Gelfond 2000</a>,

<h2><a name="PatEnvCriTheEmpRes">Pathologies of Environmental Crisis &ndash; Theories and Empirical Research</a></h2>

<p>
Part of environmental philosophy&rsquo;s project since its inception
is the diagnosis of the origins of our present-day environmental
extremities. The best known of these is probably Lynn White&rsquo;s
theory. As seen in the main entry, White argues that
Jud&aelig;o-Christian monotheism, because of its essentially
anthropocentric attitude towards nature, is the ideological source of
the modern environmental crisis. At the heart of his philosophical cum
cultural-historical analysis seems to be a simple structure:</p>

<blockquote>
W1. Christianity leads to anthropocentrism.
<br />
W2. Anthropocentrism leads to environmentally damaging behaviours.
<br />
W3. So, Christianity is the origin of environmental crisis.
</blockquote>

<p>
The second premise of White&rsquo;s argument also seems to have a
central place in a number of rival diagnoses. In fact, the structure
of the major theories in the field is regularly of this sort: (1)
<em>X</em> leads to anthropocentrism, (2) anthropocentrism leads to
environmentally damaging behaviours; therefore (3) <em>X</em> is the
origin of environmental crisis. Three other well-known cases have
already been discussed (section 3 above), namely: ecofeminism (which
identifies <em>X</em> with those patterns of thought that are
characteristically patriarchal), deep ecology (which takes <em>X</em>
to be atomistic individualism), and the new animism (which regards the
disenchantment of nature as the <em>X</em>-factor).</p>

<p>
The four theories all seem to have one view in common: that
anthropocentrism is at the heart of the problem of environmental
destructiveness. If anthropocentrism is the problem, then perhaps
non-anthropocentrism is the solution. At this point, it may be helpful
to separate two theses of non-anthropocentrism, ones that are not
normally distinguished in the literature:</p>

<blockquote>
The <em>evaluative thesis</em> (of non-anthropocentrism) is the claim
that natural non-human things have intrinsic value, i.e., value in
their own right independent of any use they have for others.

<p>
The <em>psycho-behavioural thesis</em> (of non-anthropocentrism) is
the claim that people who believe in the evaluative thesis of
non-anthropocentrism are more likely to behave environmentally (i.e.,
behave in beneficial ways, or at least not in harmful ways, towards
the environment) than those who do not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Much of the last three decades of environmental ethics has been spent
analysing, clarifying and examining the evaluative thesis of
non-anthropocentrism, which has now achieved a nearly canonical status
within the discipline. By contrast, the psycho-behavioural thesis is
seldom discussed, but is part of the tacit background of environmental
ethics. When it does get explicit mention this is often in the
introductions or prefaces of books, or in reference works &ndash; for
example, when it is said that deep ecology&rsquo;s &ldquo;greatest
influence &hellip; may be through the diverse forms of environmental
activism that it inspires&rdquo; (Taylor and Zimmerman 2005, compare
Rolston 1988, xii, Sessions 1995, xx-xxi, Sylvan and Bennett 1994,
4&ndash;5, and see also Akamani 2020, 5). If the psycho-behavioural
thesis is true, then it is important in two ways: (1) it provides a
rationale for both the diagnosis and solution of environmental
problems, and (2) it gives practical justification to the discipline
of environmental ethics itself (conceived as the mission to secure
converts to the evaluative thesis of non-anthropocentrism).
Conversely, if the psycho-behavioural thesis turns out to be false,
then&mdash;since the thesis is the common tacit assumption of all four
theories&mdash;not only the discipline itself, but also the four major
diagnostic theories of the origin of the environmental predicament
will be seriously undermined .</p>

<p>
Central to the psycho-behavioural thesis is a problematic assumption:
that if people believe they have a moral duty to respect nature or
believe that natural things are intrinsically valuable, then they
really will act in more environmentally-friendly ways. This empirical
question cannot be answered by purely<em> a priori</em> philosophical
reasoning. In fact, the other core premises in the four major
philosophical theories on the origin of environmental crisis are also
empirical claims about social and cultural reality. To be credible,
they must be able to stand up to empirical testing. For example, are
people who think in dualistic and hierarchical ways (as described by
feminists) in fact more likely to have anthropocentric attitudes and
more likely to act harmfully towards the environment? Are people who
believe in animism (as panpsychists argue) in fact less likely to have
anthropocentric attitudes and also less likely to harm the
environment? What about people who adopt some relational or holistic
view of the world, as advocated by deep ecologists? How do they act
toward nature compared to those who adopt a more individualistic and
atomistic worldview? These questions about the relations among various
belief systems and behaviours look no different in kind from the sorts
of questions that social scientists regularly ask.</p>

<p>
Of the major philosophical theories on the origin of environmental
crisis, Lynn White&rsquo;s is the only one to have been empirically
tested by social scientists. The net result of these studies for the
most part has been &ldquo;inconclusive&rdquo;, especially when
education, sex, age and social class are also factored in (Shaiko
1987, Greeley 1993, Woodrum and Hoban 1994, Eckberg and Blocker 1996,
Boyd 1999). By and large, anthropocentrism rather than
non-anthropocentrism persists as the focus of work on the
&ldquo;greening&rdquo; of religion (see Taylor, van Wieren and Zaleha
2016). Authors often note that &ldquo;anthropocentrism does not
explain the obvious differences between conservative and liberal
Christians on climate change&rdquo; (Zaleha and Szasz 2015). Moreover,
like their philosophical counterparts, environmental sociologists
often take the psycho-behavioural thesis of non-anthropocentrism for
granted. Some of the best-known and most widely used survey
instruments in the field are also problematic. Riley Dunlap and
collaborators developed many years ago the &ldquo;New Environmental
Paradigm&rdquo; (NEP) scale, to measure pro-environmental attitudes
(Dunlap and van Liere 1978). That scale, and its later revisions (see
Dunlap et al. 2000), is problematic precisely because it explicitly
uses indicators of beliefs in anthropocentrism to measure the presence
of un-environmental attitudes, thus assuming in advance that
anthropocentric beliefs are harmful to the environment. But whether
that is so should be settled by empirical investigation rather than by
an act of<em> a priori</em> stipulation in survey design. Likewise,
the psycho-behavioural thesis of non-anthropocentrism would also
require such testing.</p>

<p>
Despite the fact that there is a striking common underlying structure
between White&rsquo;s theory and the other major theories discussed
above, no sociological studies so far have been done on the other
theories, nor on the common underlying psycho-behavioural thesis of
non-anthropocentrism and its effects. This presents an opportunity for
interdisciplinary collaborations among philosophers and social
scientists. Many tools and methods well established in the social
sciences can justifiably be adapted for use in research on
environmental philosophy, giving the subject an <em>empirical</em> or
even <em>experimental</em> turn. Such work may stimulate new ideas
about the origins of our environmental pathologies, and for testing
the extent to which belief systems and worldviews actually drive
attitudes and behaviours. As long as empirical facts are relevant to
philosophical and ethical thought, adoption of social science methods
will be a means of keeping our theorising in touch with the
motivations and behaviours of the people we are trying to describe and
influence.</p>

<p>
Similar points about the role of empirical investigations can also be
made about theorizing over a range of other problems, including
drought, the preservation of biodiversity, and climate change. There
is increasing agreement across the entire globe that the world is
facing chronic and unprecedented environmental problems, many of them
of human origin. Indeed, the United States military, responding to an
albeit speculative report on abrupt climate change prepared for the
Pentagon by the Global Business Network (see Schwartz and Randall
2003, in the Other Internet Resources section below), have declared
that the problems of adjustment to climate change constitute a more
severe threat to national and international security than does
terrorism. Public perceptions across a variety of nations also match
this perception (Poushter and Huang 2019). More severe droughts,
floods and changing weather patterns, the expected burden of caring
for environmental refugees, the effects of consumerism, and the health
decline associated with various forms of pollution are continuing and
major problems for human beings themselves (see Shue 2001, Sagoff
2001, Thompson 2001), and raise crucial issues about sustainability
and environmental justice (see Shrader-Frechette 2002, Gonzalez,
Atapattu, &amp; Seck 2021). The prospects for controlling climate
change remain dire (IPCC 2021). At the same time, the continuing
destruction of natural environments and the widespread loss of both
plant and animal species pose increasing problems for other forms of
life on the planet. In facing these problems, there will likely be
great opportunities for co-operation and synergy between philosophers
and both natural and social scientists.</p>

<p>
Like many other important and interesting questions, no single
discipline could claim sole ownership of those raised above about the
origins of the modern environmental crises and the quandaries we now
face, the relation between environmental problems and social
injustice, and the vexed question of how human beings should relate to
the natural environment in their pursuit of happiness and well-being.
The move away from armchair speculation to link up with a wider
community of inquiry appears inevitable not only in environmental
ethics but in all areas of practical philosophy.</p>

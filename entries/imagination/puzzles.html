<h2>Puzzles and Paradoxes of Imagination and the Arts</h2>

<p>
In investigating the nature of imagination, philosophers have
developed and debated a number of puzzles and paradoxes related to
imagination&rsquo;s role in engagement with the arts, especially with
fictional narratives. These puzzles and paradoxes have been used to
clarify the relationship between imagination and more familiar folk
psychological attitudes, namely belief and desire. Insofar as theories
of imagination are partly assessed by their ability to explain
imagination&rsquo;s role in engagement with the arts, these puzzles
and paradoxes also function as tests for those theories.</p>

<p>
This supplement covers four prominent puzzles in the discussions of
imagination&rsquo;s role in engagement with the arts. First, the
<em>puzzle of imaginative resistance</em> explores apparent
limitations on what can be imagined during engagements with the arts
and, relatedly, what can be made fictional in artworks. Second, the
<em>paradox of emotional response to fictions</em> (sometimes known as
the &ldquo;paradox of fiction&rdquo;) examines psychological and
normative similarities between affective responses prompted by
imaginings versus affective responses by reality-directed attitudes.
Third, the <em>paradox of tragedy</em> and the <em>paradox of
horror</em> examine psychological and normative differences between
affective responses prompted by imaginings versus affective responses
by reality-directed attitudes. Fourth, the <em>puzzle of moral
persuasion</em> is concerned with real-world outputs of imaginative
engagements with artworks; specifically, whether and how artworks can
morally educate or corrupt.</p>

<h3 id="ImagResi">1. Imaginative Resistance</h3>

<p>
<em>Imaginative resistance</em> occurs when an otherwise competent
imaginer experiences a constraint in taking part in an imaginative
activity (see Gendler &amp; Liao 2016 and Miyazono &amp; Liao 2016 for
overviews). Philosophers have focused primarily on when people
experience imaginative resistance in response to stories. Suppose, for
example, that you were confronted with a variation of <em>Macbeth</em>
where </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the facts of [Duncan&rsquo;s] murder remain as they are in fact
presented in the play, but it is prescribed in this alternate fiction
that this was unfortunate only for having interfered with
Macbeth&rsquo;s sleep. (Moran 1994) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If you find it difficult to imaginatively engage with this story, then
you would be experiencing imaginative resistance.</p>

<p>
While early discussions of imaginative resistance tended to focus on
examples (like the one above) involving &ldquo;morally deviant&rdquo;
worlds, it is now widely agreed that this initial characterization was
too restrictive (Walton 2006; Yablo 2002; but see Gendler 2006 for a
partial dissent). For example, Brian Weatherson (2004) has argued that
resistance puzzles arise not only for normative concepts (including
thick and thin moral concepts, aesthetic judgments, and epistemic
evaluations), but also for attributions of mental states, attributions
of content, and claims involving constitution or ontological
status.</p>

<p>
As Kendall Walton (2006: 137) notes, the questions addressed under the
rubric of imaginative resistance turn out to be a &ldquo;tangled nest
of importantly distinct but easily confused puzzles&rdquo;. Indeed, it
has been argued (Weatherson 2004) that there are at least four such
puzzles, illustrated with Moran&rsquo;s variation-of-Macbeth
example:</p>

<ol>

<li>The <em>imaginative puzzle</em> is concerned with the
audience&rsquo;s difficulties with imagining that Duncan&rsquo;s
murder was unfortunate only for having interfered with Macbeth&rsquo;s
sleep.</li>

<li>The <em>fictionality puzzle</em> is concerned with the
author&rsquo;s failure of <em>authorial authority</em> (that is, what
the implied author says is true in the story world) to make it true in
the story world that Duncan&rsquo;s murder was unfortunate only for
having interfered with Macbeth&rsquo;s sleep.</li>

<li>The <em>phenomenological puzzle</em> is concerned with the
audience&rsquo;s sense of jarring confusion with the story&rsquo;s
claim that Duncan&rsquo;s murder was unfortunate only for having
interfered with Macbeth&rsquo;s sleep.</li>

<li>The <em>aesthetic value puzzle</em> is concerned with the
audience&rsquo;s sense that the story is aesthetically compromised by
the story&rsquo;s claim that Duncan&rsquo;s murder was unfortunate
only for having interfered with Macbeth&rsquo;s sleep.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The bulk of philosophical discussion has been devoted&mdash;often
without distinguishing between them&mdash;to the imaginative and
fictionality puzzles. Three types of responses dominate early
discussions of this puzzle (Gendler 2006; Gendler &amp; Liao
2016).</p>

<p>
<em>Cantian theories</em> maintain that imaginative resistance at its
core can be traced to the impossibility of engaging in some sort of
prompted imaginative activity: one simply can&rsquo;t imagine as one
has been invited to (Walton 1990, 1994b; Weatherson 2004; Weinberg
&amp; Meskin 2006; Yablo 2002). Cantian theories typically take the
fictionality puzzle to be fundamental, suggesting that one experiences
the jarring phenomenology and the imaginative inability associated
with imaginative resistance because the default position of authorial
authority has broken down.</p>

<p>
<em>Wontian theories</em> maintain that imaginative resistance can be
traced to an unwillingness to engage in some sort of prompted
imaginative activity: one simply won&rsquo;t imagine as one has been
invited to (Currie 2002a; Gendler 2000a, 2006; Stokes 2006). Wontian
theories typically take the imaginability puzzle to be fundamental.
According to them, the default position of authorial authority breaks
down because the reader finds it improper to engage in the imaginative
activity that is prompted, such as imaginatively taking on morally
deviant attitudes.</p>

<p>
<em>Eliminativist theories</em> maintain that there is no such a thing
as imaginative resistance per se (Mothersill 2003; Stock 2005; Tanner
1994; Todd 2009). Rather, they maintain, the appearance of a
philosophical problem arises from the bizarre so-called stories that
philosophers have concocted. Nothing like the imaginative,
fictionality, or phenomenological puzzles arises with narratives and
imaginings in ordinary non-philosophical contexts.</p>

<p>
Most recently, philosophers have built on one insight of eliminativist
theories&mdash;the importance of context&mdash;to refine earlier
cantian and wontian theories (Brock 2012; Clavel-Vazquez 2018; Liao
2016; Nanay 2010; Stear 2015). During the same period, philosophers
and psychologists have also started to conduct experimental studies to
clarify the contours of imaginative resistance (Black, Capps, &amp;
Barnes 2018; Kim, Kneer, &amp; Stuart, 2018; Liao, Strohminger,
&amp; Sripada 2014).</p>

<h3 id="EmotRespFict">2. Emotional Response to Fictions</h3>

<p>
The <em>paradox of emotional response to fictions</em> (sometimes
known simply as the &ldquo;paradox of fiction&rdquo;) arises because
people seem to routinely exhibit genuine emotional responses to
characters, situations, and events that are merely imagined. Given the
central role of imagination in engagement with fictions, this paradox
has been used to clarify the cognitive architectural connection
between imagination and emotions.</p>

<p>
The paradox is typically formulated using the following three
statements (Friend 2016; see also Radford 1975; Gendler &amp;
Kovakovich 2005):</p>

<ol start="1" type="a">

<li><em>Response Condition</em>: People experience (genuine, ordinary)
emotions toward fictional characters, situations, and events.</li>

<li><em>Belief Condition</em>: People do not believe in the existence
of fictional characters, situations, and events.</li>

<li><em>Coordination Condition</em>: People do not experience
(genuine, ordinary) emotions when they do not believe in the existence
of the objects of emotion.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Each of the three statements seem intuitively true, and yet they are
jointly inconsistent. The <em>descriptive</em> version of the paradox
(originating in Walton 1978) is concerned with the question of whether
emotional responses to fictions are to be classified as the same kind
of emotions we experience in other contexts. The <em>normative</em>
version of the paradox (originating in Radford 1975) is concerned with
the question of whether emotional responses to fictions are irrational
or inappropriate.</p>

<p>
The debate over the descriptive version of the paradox revolves around
which of the statements to reject.</p>

<p>
The Belief Condition is rarely challenged. Its rejection has few
adherents among contemporary philosophers (a possible historical
advocate is Coleridge 1817) and is generally discussed only to be
subsequently dismissed (see Currie 1990; Radford 1975; Walton 1978).
The Response Condition is also rarely rejected, though some follow
Kendall Walton (1978, 1990, 1997), who argues that emotional responses
to fictions are &ldquo;quasi-emotions&rdquo;, which differ from
genuine emotions in their source (they are generated by beliefs about
what is fictionally rather than actually true), and, typically, in
their behavioral consequences (though we may pity Ophelia, we make no
effort to console her in her sorrow.)</p>

<p>
By far, the orthodoxy is to reject Coordination Condition. <em>Broad
cognitivists</em> hold that emotions must be triggered by a cognitive
mental state, but (cognitive) imagination can play that role as well
as belief (Carroll 1990; Feagin 1996; Gendler 2008a, 2008b; Lamarque
1981; Matravers 1998; Meskin &amp; Weinberg 2003; Moran 1994; Weinberg
&amp; Meskin 2006). <em>Noncognitivists</em> hold that emotions do not
need to be triggered by any cognitive mental state (Robinson
2005).</p>

<p>
The normative version of the paradox treats Coordination Condition as
a <em>norm</em> governing emotional responses to fictions. Unlike the
descriptive version of the paradox, the normative version concedes
that people experience (genuine, ordinary) emotions toward fictional
characters, situations, and events; but it alleges that they are
irrational or inappropriate in doing so.</p>

<p>
The resolution of the normative version of the paradox depends on the
relevant conception of rationality or appropriateness. Tamar
Szab&oacute; Gendler and Karson Kovakovich (2005) argue that emotions
in response to the merely imagined are essential to rational decision
making; so, emotional response to fictions might be instrumentally or
evolutionarily rational. Others, however, appeal to fittingness norms
of emotions (D&rsquo;Arms &amp; Jacobson 2000), distinctive norms for
fictions (Friend 2010; Gilmore 2011), or even moral norms for engaging
with fictional narratives (see Eaton 2016 for an overview; see also
<a href="#ImagResi">section 1</a> of this supplement).</p>

<h3 id="TragHorr">3. Tragedy and Horror</h3>

<p>
While the paradox of emotional response to fictions focuses on the
similarity between our reactions to the imaginary and the real, the
<em>paradox of tragedy</em> (which arguably goes back to
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Poetics</em>) and <em>the paradox of horror</em>
(Carroll 1990) focus on the difference between them. While people
generally avoid real scenarios that make us sad, they seem to
(sometimes) seek out imaginary scenarios that make us sad, such as
those in works of tragedy. While people generally avoid real scenarios
that make us fearful, they seem to (sometimes) seek out imaginary
scenarios that make them fearful, such as those in works of horror.
Again, given the central role of imagination in engagement with
fictions, the paradoxes of tragedy and horror&mdash;along with the
paradox of emotional responses to fictions&mdash;have been used to
clarify the cognitive architectural connection between imagination and
emotions. </p>

<p>
Aaron Smuts (2009: 42; see also Strohl forthcoming) offers a generalization of the two paradoxes in
terms of three statements that each seems true but are jointly
inconsistent. Below is a slightly modified formulation of the paradox,
focusing just on tragedy:</p>

<ol start="1" type="a">

<li><em>Negative Emotion Condition</em>: People experience negative
emotions in response to tragedy.</li>

<li><em>Negative Avoidance Condition</em>: If people experience
negative emotions in response to something, then they tend to avoid
it.</li>

<li><em>Non-Avoidance Condition</em>: People do not tend to avoid
tragedy.</li>
</ol>

<p>
No solution rejects Non-Avoidance Condition.</p>

<p>
Solutions that reject Negative Emotion Condition deny
that&mdash;properly understood&mdash;the emotion that tragedy evokes
in us is negative. For example, David Hume (&ldquo;Of Tragedy&rdquo;)
offers a conversion solution: in the context of imaginative engagement
with the arts, such negative emotional responses are converted into
something positive and pleasant.</p>

<p>
Solutions that reject Negative Avoidance Condition deny that people
tend to avoid things that evoke negative emotions in them. Aristotle
(<em>Poetics</em>) is often attributed the cathartic solution, in
which people seek out tragedy for its purification or purgation
effects. While this is a popular folk view, Smuts (2009) offers
forceful criticisms. Smuts (2007) defends a kind of compensation
solution, in which people seek out tragedy for the valuable rich
experience it provides. Susan Feagin (1983) defends a representative
metacompensation solution, in which people experience
pleasure&mdash;something like a self-congratulatory
feeling&mdash;toward their emotional response to tragedy.</p>

<h3 id="MoraPers">4. Moral Persuasion</h3>

<p>
Since ancient times, philosophers and others have argued that
representational arts can play a role in moral persuasion. Plato
famously warned against the power of poetry to morally corrupt its
audience (<em>Republic</em> X; see also entry on
 <a href="../plato-rhetoric/index.html">Plato on rhetoric and poetry</a>).
 Contemporary philosophers tend to focus more on the prospect of moral
education (see, for example, Carroll 2002; Currie 1995; Jacobson 1996;
Kieran 1996; Murdoch 1970; Nussbaum 1990; Robinson 2005).</p>

<p>
A persistent <em>puzzle of moral persuasion</em> asks how imaginative
representations can change moral perspectives that are applicable to
the real world. This puzzle has been used to clarify the connections
between imagination and other components of the cognitive architecture
that figure more frequently in discussions of moral
psychology&mdash;namely belief, desire, and emotions.</p>

<p>
As No&euml;l Carroll (2000) outlines, there are three broad approaches
to this puzzle. The <em>knowledge approach</em> argues that engagement
with the arts can give a person propositional knowledge of moral
truths that are abstracted from the fictional representation. The
<em>acquaintance approach</em> argues that engagement with the arts
can give a person acquaintance knowledge with novel perspectives and
novel circumstances. The <em>cultivation approach</em>, by contrast,
does not claim that engagement with the arts can give a person any new
knowledge; rather, the engagement allows the person to refine and
practice their existing moral understandings and capabilities.</p>

<p>
Martha Nussbaum (1990) provides an account that exemplifies an
acquaintance-cultivation approach. Nussbaum maintains that one of the
central moral skills is the ability to discern morally salient
features of one&rsquo;s situation. This skill, she contends, is one
that must be developed, and one to which the engagement with
literature might effectively contribute by providing &ldquo;close and
careful interpretative descriptions&rdquo; of imagined scenarios that
enable emotional involvement untainted by distorting self-interest
(1990: 46&ndash;48). J&egrave;meljan Hakemulder (2000) reviews some
empirical psychological evidence for this hypothesis.</p>

<p>
Tamar Szab&oacute; Gendler (2000, 2006) suggests that there is a
symmetric relation between what we <em>import</em> into an imaginative
engagement and what we <em>export</em> from it. Indeed, it is this
observation that underlies her account of imaginative resistance,
which says that we resist imaginatively engaging with morally deviant
fictional worlds because we do not want to export its moral
perspective back to our own (see <a href="#ImagResi">section 1</a> of this supplement).
Shen-yi Liao (2013) draws on this observation to argue that the way
that an artwork can change one&rsquo;s moral perspective is, in part,
dependent on its genre.</p>

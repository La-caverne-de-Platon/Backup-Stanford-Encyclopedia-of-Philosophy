<h1>Consequentialism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue May 20, 2003; substantive revision Mon Jun 3, 2019</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Consequentialism, as its name suggests, is simply the view that
normative properties depend only on consequences. This historically
important and still popular theory embodies the basic intuition that
what is best or right is whatever makes the world best in the future,
because we cannot change the past, so worrying about the past is no
more useful than crying over spilled milk.  This general approach can
be applied at different levels to different normative properties of
different kinds of things, but the most prominent example is probably
consequentialism about the moral rightness of acts, which holds that
whether an act is morally right depends only on the consequences of
that act or of something related to that act, such as the motive
behind the act or a general rule requiring acts of the same kind.</p>

<h2><a name="ClaUti">1. Classic Utilitarianism</a></h2>

<p>

The paradigm case of consequentialism is utilitarianism, whose
classic proponents were Jeremy Bentham (1789), John Stuart Mill (1861),
and Henry Sidgwick (1907). (For predecessors, see Schneewind 1997, 2002.)
Classic utilitarians held hedonistic act consequentialism. <em>Act
consequentialism</em> is the claim that an act is morally right if and
only if that act maximizes the good, that is, if and only if the total
amount of good for all minus the total amount of bad for all is greater
than this net amount for any incompatible act available to the agent on
that occasion. (Cf. Moore 1912, chs. 1&ndash;2.) <em>Hedonism</em> then
claims that pleasure is the only intrinsic good and that pain is the
only intrinsic bad.</p>

<p> 
These claims are often summarized in the slogan that an act is
right if and only if it causes &ldquo;the greatest happiness for the
greatest number.&rdquo; This slogan is misleading, however. An act can
increase happiness for most (the greatest number of) people but still
fail to maximize the net good in the world if the smaller number of
people whose happiness is not increased lose much more than the
greater number gains. The principle of utility would not allow that
kind of sacrifice of the smaller number to the greater number unless
the net good overall is increased more than any alternative. </p>

<p>

Classic utilitarianism is consequentialist as opposed to
deontological because of what it denies. It denies that moral rightness
depends directly on anything other than consequences, such as whether
the agent promised in the past to do the act now. Of course, the fact
that the agent promised to do the act might indirectly affect the act&rsquo;s
consequences if breaking the promise will make other people unhappy.
Nonetheless, according to classic utilitarianism, what makes it morally
wrong to break the promise is its future effects on those other people rather
than the fact that the agent promised in the past.</p>

<p>

Since classic utilitarianism reduces all morally relevant factors
(Kagan 1998, 17&ndash;22) to consequences, it might appear simple. However,
classic utilitarianism is actually a complex combination of many
distinct claims, including the following claims about the moral
rightness of acts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends only on
<em>consequences</em> (as opposed to the circumstances or the intrinsic
nature of the act or anything that happens before the act).</p>

<p>
Actual Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends
only on the <em>actual</em> consequences (as opposed to foreseen,
foreseeable, intended, or likely consequences).</p>

<p>
Direct Consequentialism = whether an act is morally right depends
only on the consequences of <em>that act itself</em> (as opposed to the
consequences of the agent&rsquo;s motive, of a rule or practice that covers
other acts of the same kind, and so on).</p>

<p>
Evaluative Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on the
<em>value</em> of the consequences (as opposed to non-evaluative features of the
consequences).</p>

<p>
Hedonism = the value of the consequences depends only on the
<em>pleasures</em> and <em>pains</em> in the consequences (as opposed
to other supposed goods, such as freedom, knowledge, life, and so on).</p>

<p>

Maximizing Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on which
consequences are <em>best</em> (as opposed to merely satisfactory or an
improvement over the status quo).</p>

<p>
Aggregative Consequentialism = which consequences are best is some
function of the values of <em>parts</em> of those consequences (as
opposed to rankings of whole worlds or sets of consequences).</p>

<p>
Total Consequentialism = moral rightness depends only on the
<em>total</em> net good in the consequences (as opposed to the average
net good per person).</p>

<p>
Universal Consequentialism = moral rightness depends on the
consequences for <em>all</em> people or sentient beings (as opposed to
only the individual agent, members of the individual&rsquo;s society,
present people, or any other limited group).</p>

<p>
Equal Consideration = in determining moral rightness, benefits to
one person matter <em>just as much</em> as similar benefits to any
other person (as opposed to putting more weight on the worse or worst off).</p>

<p>
Agent-neutrality = whether some consequences are better than others
does not depend on whether the consequences are evaluated from the
perspective of the agent (as opposed to an observer).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

These claims could be clarified, supplemented, and subdivided
further. What matters here is just that most pairs of these claims are
logically independent, so a moral theorist could consistently accept
some of them without accepting others. Yet classic utilitarians
accepted them all.  That fact makes classic utilitarianism a more
complex theory than it might appear at first sight.</p>

<p>

It also makes classic utilitarianism subject to attack from many
angles. Persistent opponents posed plenty of problems for classic
utilitarianism. Each objection led some utilitarians to give up some of
the original claims of classic utilitarianism. By dropping one or more
of those claims, descendants of utilitarianism can construct a wide
variety of moral theories. Advocates of these theories often call them
consequentialism rather than utilitarianism so that their theories will
not be subject to refutation by association with the classic
utilitarian theory.</p>

<h2><a name="WhaCon">2. What is Consequentialism?</a></h2>

<p>

This array of alternatives raises the question of which moral
theories count as consequentialist (as opposed to deontological) and
why. In actual usage, the term &ldquo;consequentialism&rdquo; seems to
be used as a family resemblance term to refer to any descendant of
classic utilitarianism that remains close enough to its ancestor in the
important respects. Of course, different philosophers see different
respects as the important ones. Hence, there is no agreement on which
theories count as consequentialist under this definition.</p>

<p>

To resolve this vagueness, we need to determine which of the various
claims of classic utilitarianism are essential to consequentialism. One
claim seems clearly necessary. Any consequentialist theory must accept
the claim that I labeled &ldquo;consequentialism&rdquo;, namely, that
certain normative properties depend only on consequences. If that claim
is dropped, the theory ceases to be consequentialist.</p>

<p>

It is less clear whether that claim by itself is sufficient to make
a theory consequentialist. Several philosophers assert that a moral
theory should not be classified as consequentialist unless it is
agent-neutral (McNaughton and Rawling 1991, Howard-Snyder 1994, Pettit
1997). This narrower definition is motivated by the fact that many
self-styled critics of consequentialism argue against
agent-neutrality.</p>

<p> Other philosophers prefer a broader definition that does not
require a moral theory to be agent-neutral in order to be
consequentialist (Bennett 1989; Broome 1991, 5&ndash;6; and Skorupski
1995). Criticisms of agent-neutrality can then be understood as
directed against one part of classic utilitarianism that need not be
adopted by every moral theory that is consequentialist. Moreover,
according to those who prefer a broader definition of
consequentialism, the narrower definition conflates independent claims
and obscures a crucial commonality between agent-neutral
consequentialism and other moral theories that focus exclusively on
consequences, such as moral egoism and recent self-styled
consequentialists who allow agent-relativity into their theories of
value (Sen 1982, Broome 1991, Portmore 2001, 2003).</p>

<p>

A definition solely in terms of consequences might seem too broad,
because it includes absurd theories such as the theory that an act is
morally right if it increases the number of goats in Texas. Of course,
such theories are implausible. Still, it is not implausible to call
them consequentialist, since they do look only at consequences. The
implausibility of one version of consequentialism does not make
consequentialism implausible in general, since other versions of
consequentialism still might be plausible.</p>

<p>

Besides, anyone who wants to pick out a smaller set of moral
theories that excludes this absurd theory may talk about evaluative
consequentialism, which is the claim that moral rightness depends only
on the value of the consequences. Then those who want to talk about the
even smaller group of moral theories that accepts both evaluative
consequentialism and agent-neutrality may describe them as
agent-neutral evaluative consequentialism. If anyone still insists on
calling these smaller groups of theories by the simple name,
&lsquo;consequentialism&rsquo;, this narrower usage will not affect any
substantive issue.</p>

<p>

Still, if the definition of consequentialism becomes too broad, it
might seem to lose force. Some philosophers have argued that any moral
theory, or at least any plausible moral theory, could be represented
as a version of consequentialism (Sosa 1993, Portmore 2009, Dreier
1993 and 2011; but see Brown 2011). If so, then it means little to
label a theory as consequentialist. The real content comes only by
contrasting theories that are not consequentialist.</p>

<p>

In the end, what matters is only that we get clear about which
theories a particular commentator counts as consequentialist or not
and which claims are supposed to make them consequentialist or
not. Only then can we know which claims are at stake when this
commentator supports or criticizes what they call
&ldquo;consequentialism&rdquo;. Then we can ask whether each objection really
refutes that particular claim.</p>

<h2><a name="WhaGooHedVsPluCon">3. What is Good? Hedonistic vs. Pluralistic Consequentialisms</a></h2>

<p>

Some moral theorists seek a single simple basic principle because they
assume that simplicity is needed in order to decide what is right when
less basic principles or reasons conflict. This assumption seems to
make hedonism attractive.  Unfortunately, however, hedonism is not as
simple as they assume, because hedonists count both pleasures and
pains. Pleasure is distinct from the absence of pain, and pain is
distinct from the absence of pleasure, since sometimes people feel
neither pleasure nor pain, and sometimes they feel both at
once. Nonetheless, hedonism was adopted partly because it seemed
simpler than competing views.</p>

<p>

The simplicity of hedonism was also a source of opposition. From the
start, the hedonism in classic utilitarianism was treated with
contempt. Some contemporaries of Bentham and Mill argued that hedonism
lowers the value of human life to the level of animals, because it
implies that, as Bentham said, an unsophisticated game (such as
push-pin) is as good as highly intellectual poetry if the game creates
as much pleasure (Bentham 1843).  <em>Quantitative</em> hedonists
sometimes respond that great poetry almost always creates more
pleasure than trivial games (or sex and drugs and rock-and-roll),
because the pleasures of poetry are more certain (or probable),
durable (or lasting), fecund (likely to lead to other pleasures), pure
(unlikely to lead to pains), and so on.</p>

<p>

Mill used a different strategy to avoid calling push-pin as good as
poetry. He distinguished higher and lower qualities of pleasures
according to the preferences of people who have experienced both kinds
(Mill 1861, 56; compare Plato 1993 and Hutcheson 1755, 421&ndash;23). This
<em>qualitative</em> hedonism has been subjected to much criticism,
including charges that it is incoherent and does not count as hedonism
(Moore 1903, 80&ndash;81; cf. Feldman 1997, 106&ndash;24).</p>

<p>

Even if qualitative hedonism is coherent and is a kind of hedonism, it
still might not seem plausible. Some critics argue that not
<em>all</em> pleasures are valuable, since, for example, there is no
value in the pleasures that a sadist gets from whipping a victim or
that an addict gets from drugs. Other opponents object that not
<em>only</em> pleasures are intrinsically valuable, because other
things are valuable independently of whether they lead to pleasure or
avoid pain. For example, my love for my wife does not seem to become
less valuable when I get less pleasure from her because she contracts
some horrible disease. Similarly, freedom seems valuable even when it
creates anxiety, and even when it is freedom to do something (such as
leave one&rsquo;s country) that one does not want to do. Again, many people
value knowledge of distant galaxies regardless of whether this knowledge
will create pleasure or avoid pain.</p>

<p>

These points against hedonism are often supplemented with the story
of the experience machine found in Nozick (1974, 42&ndash;45; cf. De Brigard 2010 and the movie,
<em>The Matrix</em>. People on this machine <em>believe</em> they are
spending time with their friends, winning Olympic gold medals and Nobel prizes,
having sex with their favorite lovers, or doing whatever gives them the
greatest balance of pleasure over pain. Although they have no real
friends or lovers and actually accomplish nothing, people on the
experience machine get just as much pleasure as if their beliefs were
true. Moreover, they feel no (or little) pain. Assuming that the
machine is reliable, it would seem irrational not to hook oneself up to
this machine <em>if</em> pleasure and pain were all that mattered, as
hedonists claim. Since it does <em>not</em> seem irrational to refuse
to hook oneself up to this machine, hedonism seems inadequate. The
reason is that hedonism overlooks the value of <em>real</em>
friendship, knowledge, freedom, and achievements, all of which are
lacking for deluded people on the experience machine.</p>

<p>

Some hedonists claim that this objection rests on a
misinterpretation of hedonism. If hedonists see pleasure and pain as
<em>sensations</em>, then a machine might be able to reproduce those
sensations. However, we can also say that a mother is pleased that her
daughter gets good grades. Such <em>propositional</em> pleasure occurs
only when the state of affairs in which the person takes pleasure
exists (that is, when the daughter actually gets good grades). But the
relevant states of affairs would not really exist if one were hooked
up to the experience machine. Hence, hedonists who value propositional
pleasure rather than sensational pleasure can deny that more pleasure
is achieved by hooking oneself up to such an experience machine
(Feldman 1997, 79&ndash;105; see also T&auml;nnsj&ouml; 1998 and
Feldman 2004 for more on hedonism).</p>

<p>

A related position rests on the claim that what is good is desire
satisfaction or the fulfillment of preferences; and what is bad is the
frustration of desires or preferences. What is desired or preferred is
usually not a sensation but is, rather, a state of affairs, such as
having a friend or accomplishing a goal. If a person desires or prefers
to have true friends and true accomplishments and not to be deluded,
then hooking this person up to the experience machine need not maximize
desire satisfaction. Utilitarians who adopt this theory of value can
then claim that an agent morally ought to do an act if and only if that
act maximizes desire satisfaction or preference fulfillment (that is, the degree to which the act achieves whatever is desired or preferred). What maximizes desire satisfaction or preference fulfillment need not maximize sensations of pleasure when what is desired or preferred is not a sensation of pleasure. This position is
usually described as <em>preference utilitarianism</em>.</p>

<p>

One problem for preference utilitarianism concerns how to make
interpersonal comparisons (though this problem also arises for several
other theories of value). If we want to know what one person prefers,
we can ask what that person would choose in conflicts. We cannot,
however, use the same method to determine whether one person&rsquo;s
preference is stronger or weaker than another person&rsquo;s preference,
since these different people might choose differently in the decisive
conflicts. We need to settle which preference (or pleasure) is
stronger because we may know that Jones prefers A&rsquo;s being done to A&rsquo;s
not being done (and Jones would receive more pleasure from A&rsquo;s being
done than from A&rsquo;s not being done), whereas Smith prefers A&rsquo;s not
being done (and Smith would receive more pleasure from A&rsquo;s not being
done than from A&rsquo;s being done). To determine whether it is right to do
A or not to do A, we must be able to compare the strengths of Jones&rsquo;s
and Smith&rsquo;s preferences (or the amounts of pleasure each would receive
in her preferred outcome) in order to determine whether doing A or not
doing A would be better overall. Utilitarians and consequentialists
have proposed many ways to solve this problem of interpersonal
comparison, and each attempt has received criticisms. Debates about
this problem still rage. (For a recent discussion with references, see
Coakley 2015.)</p>

<p>

Preference utilitarianism is also often criticized on the grounds that
some preferences are misinformed, crazy, horrendous, or trivial. I
might prefer to drink the liquid in a glass because I think that it is
beer, though it really is strong acid. Or I might prefer to die merely because
I am clinically depressed. Or I might prefer to torture children. Or I
might prefer to spend my life learning to write as small as possible.
In all such cases, opponents of preference utilitarianism can deny that
what I prefer is really good. Preference utilitarians can respond by
limiting the preferences that make something good, such as by referring
to informed desires that do not disappear after therapy (Brandt 1979).
However, it is not clear that such qualifications can solve all of the
problems for a preference theory of value without making the theory
circular by depending on substantive assumptions about which
preferences are for good things.</p>

<p>

Many consequentialists deny that all values can be reduced to any
single ground, such as pleasure or desire satisfaction, so they instead
adopt a pluralistic theory of value. Moore&rsquo;s <em>ideal
utilitarianism</em>, for example, takes into account the values of
beauty and truth (or knowledge) in addition to pleasure (Moore 1903,
83&ndash;85, 194; 1912). Other consequentialists add the intrinsic values of
friendship or love, freedom or ability, justice or fairness, desert, life, virtue, and so on.</p>

<p>

If the recognized values all concern individual welfare, then the
theory of value can be called <em>welfarist</em> (Sen 1979). When a
welfarist theory of value is combined with the other elements of
classic utilitarianism, the resulting theory can be called
<em>welfarist consequentialism</em>.</p>

<p>

One non-welfarist theory of value is <em>perfectionism</em>, which
claims that certain states make a person&rsquo;s life good without
necessarily being good for the person in any way that increases that
person&rsquo;s welfare (Hurka 1993, esp. 17). If this theory of value is
combined with other elements of classic utilitarianism, the resulting
theory can be called <em>perfectionist consequentialism</em> or, in
deference to its Aristotelian roots, <em>eudaemonistic
consequentialism</em>.</p>

<p>

Similarly, some consequentialists hold that an act is right if and
only if it maximizes some function of both happiness and capabilities
(Sen 1985, Nussbaum 2000). Disabilities are then seen as bad regardless
of whether they are accompanied by pain or loss of pleasure.</p>

<p>

Or one could hold that an act is right if it maximizes respect for
(or minimizes violations of) certain specified moral rights. Such
theories are sometimes described as a <em>utilitarianism of
rights</em>. This approach could be built into total consequentialism
with rights weighed against happiness and other values or,
alternatively, the disvalue of rights violations could be lexically
ranked prior to any other kind of loss or harm (cf. Rawls 1971, 42).
Such a lexical ranking within a consequentialist moral theory would
yield the result that nobody is ever justified in violating rights for
the sake of happiness or any value other than rights, although it would
still allow some rights violations in order to avoid or prevent other
rights violations.</p>

<p>

When consequentialists incorporate a variety of values, they need to
rank or weigh each value against the others. This is often difficult.
Some consequentialists even hold that certain values are
incommensurable or incomparable in that no comparison of their values
is possible (Griffin 1986 and Chang 1997). This position allows
consequentialists to recognize the possibility of irresolvable moral
dilemmas (Sinnott-Armstrong 1988, 81; Railton 2003, 249&ndash;91).</p>

<p>

Pluralism about values also enables consequentialists to handle many
of the problems that plague hedonistic utilitarianism. For example,
opponents often charge that classical utilitarians cannot explain our
obligations to keep promises and not to lie when no pain is caused or
pleasure is lost. Whether or not hedonists can meet this challenge,
pluralists can hold that knowledge is intrinsically good and/or that
false belief is intrinsically bad. Then, if deception causes false
beliefs, deception is instrumentally bad, and agents ought not to lie
without a good reason, even when lying causes no pain or loss of
pleasure. Since lying is an attempt to deceive, to lie is to attempt to
do what is morally wrong (in the absence of defeating factors).
Similarly, if a promise to do an act is an attempt to make an audience
believe that the promiser will do the act, then to break a promise is
for a promiser to make false a belief that the promiser created or tried to create.
Although there is more tale to tell, the disvalue of false belief can
be part of a consequentialist story about why it is morally wrong to
break promises.</p>

<p>

When such pluralist versions of consequentialism are not welfarist,
some philosophers would not call them <em>utilitarian</em>. However,
this usage is not uniform, since even non-welfarist views are sometimes
called utilitarian. Whatever you call them, the important point is that
consequentialism and the other elements of classical utilitarianism are
compatible with many different theories about which things are good or
valuable.</p>

<p>

Instead of turning pluralist, some consequentialists foreswear the
aggregation of values. Classic utilitarianism added up the values
within each part of the consequences to determine which total set of
consequences has the most value in it. One could, instead, aggregate
goods for each individual but not aggregate goods of separate
individuals (Roberts 2002). Or one could give up aggregation
altogether and just rank total sets of consequences or total worlds
created by acts without breaking those worlds down into valuable
parts. One motive for this move is Moore&rsquo;s principle of organic unity
(Moore 1903, 27&ndash;36), which claims that the value of a combination or &ldquo;organic unity&rdquo; of two or more things cannot be calculated simply by adding the values of the things that are combined or unified. For example, even if punishment of a criminal
causes pain, a consequentialist can hold that a world with both the
crime and the punishment is better than a world with the crime but not
the punishment, perhaps because the former contains more
justice. Similarly, a world might seem better when people do not get
pleasures that they do not deserve. Cases like these lead some
consequentialists to deny that moral rightness is any function of the
values of particular effects of acts. Instead, they compare the whole
world (or total set of consequences) that results from an action with
the whole world that results from not doing that action. If the former
is better, then the action is morally right (J.J.C. Smart 1973, 32;
Feldman 1997, 17&ndash;35). This approach can be called <em>holistic
consequentialism</em> or <em>world utilitarianism</em>.</p>

<p>

Another way to incorporate relations among values is to consider
<em>distribution</em>. Compare one outcome where most people are
destitute but a few lucky people have extremely large amounts of goods
with another outcome that contains slightly less total goods but where
every person has nearly the same amount of goods. Egalitarian critics
of classical utilitarianism argue that the latter outcome is better, so
more than the total amount of good matters. Traditional hedonistic
utilitarians who prefer the latter outcome often try to justify
egalitarian distributions of goods by appealing to a principle of
diminishing marginal utility. Other consequentialists, however,
incorporate a more robust commitment to equality. Early on, Sidgwick
(1907, 417) responded to such objections by allowing distribution to
break ties between other values. More recently, some consequentialists
have added some notion of fairness (Broome 1991, 192&ndash;200) or desert
(Feldman 1997, 154&ndash;74) to their test of which outcome is best. (See
also Kagan 1998, 48&ndash;59.) Others turn to prioritarianism, which puts more weight on people who are worse off (Adler and Norheim forthcoming). Such consequentialists do not simply add up values; they look at patterns.</p>

<p>

A related issue arises from population change. Imagine that a
government considers whether to provide free contraceptives to curb a
rise in population. Without free contraceptives, overcrowding will
bring hunger, disease, and pain, so each person will be worse off.
Still, each new person will have enough pleasure and other goods that
the total net utility will increase with the population. Classic
utilitarianism focuses on total utility, so it seems to imply that
this government should not provide free contraceptives. That seems
implausible to many utilitarians. To avoid this result, some
utilitarians claim that an act is morally wrong if and only if its
consequences contain more pain (or other disvalues) than an
alternative, regardless of positive values (cf. R. N. Smart 1958). This <em>negative
utilitarianism</em> implies that the government should provide
contraceptives, since that program reduces pain (and other disvalues),
even though it also decreases total net pleasure (or good).
Unfortunately, negative utilitarianism also seems to imply that the
government should painlessly kill everyone it can, since dead people
feel no pain (and have no false beliefs, diseases, or disabilities
&ndash; though killing them does cause loss of ability). A more popular response is average
utilitarianism, which says that the best consequences are those with
the highest average utility (cf. Rawls 1971, 161&ndash;75). The average
utility would be higher with the contraceptive program than without
it, so average utilitarianism yields the more plausible
result&mdash;that the government should adopt the contraceptive
program. Critics sometimes charge that the average utility could also
be increased by killing the worst off, but this claim is not at all
clear, because such killing would put everyone in danger (since, after
the worst off are killed, another group becomes the worst off, and
then they might be killed next). Still, average utilitarianism faces
problems of its own (such as &ldquo;the mere addition paradox&rdquo;
in Parfit 1984, chap. 19). In any case, all maximizing
consequentialists, whether or not they are pluralists, must decide
whether moral rightness depends on maximizing total good or average good.</p>

<p>

A final challenge to consequentialists&rsquo; accounts of value
derives from Geach 1956 and has been pressed recently by Thomson 2001.
Thomson argues that &ldquo;A is a good X&rdquo; (such as a good poison)
does not entail &ldquo;A is good&rdquo;, so the term &ldquo;good&rdquo;
is an attributive adjective and cannot legitimately be used without
qualification. On this view, it is senseless to call something good
unless this means that it is good for someone or in some respect or for
some use or at some activity or as an instance of some kind.
Consequentialists are supposed to violate this restriction when they
say that the total or average consequences or the world as a whole is
good without any such qualification. However, consequentialists can
respond either that the term &ldquo;good&rdquo; has predicative uses in
addition to its attributive uses or that when they call a world or
total set of consequences good, they are calling it good for
consequences or for a world (Sinnott-Armstrong 2003a). If so, the fact
that &ldquo;good&rdquo; is often used attributively creates no problem
for consequentialists.</p>

<h2><a name="WhiConActVsExpCon">4. Which Consequences? Actual vs. Expected Consequentialisms</a></h2>

<p>

A second set of problems for classic utilitarianism is
epistemological. Classic utilitarianism seems to require that agents
calculate all consequences of each act for every person for all time.
That&rsquo;s impossible.</p>

<p>

This objection rests on a misinterpretation. These critics assume that the
principle of utility is supposed to be used as a <em>decision
procedure</em> or <em>guide</em>, that is, as a method that agents
consciously apply to acts in advance to help them make decisions.
However, most classic and contemporary utilitarians and
consequentialists do not propose their principles as decision
procedures. (Bales 1971) Bentham wrote, &ldquo;It is not to be expected
that this process [his hedonic calculus] should be strictly pursued
previously to every moral judgment.&rdquo; (1789, Chap. IV, Sec. VI)
Mill agreed, &ldquo;it is a misapprehension of the utilitarian mode of
thought to conceive it as implying that people should fix their minds
upon so wide a generality as the world, or society at large.&rdquo;
(1861, Chap. II, Par. 19) Sidgwick added, &ldquo;It is not necessary
that the end which gives the criterion of rightness should always be
the end at which we consciously aim.&rdquo; (1907, 413)</p>

<p>

Instead, most consequentialists claim that overall utility is the
<em>criterion</em> or <em>standard</em> of what is morally right or
morally ought to be done. Their theories are intended to spell out the
necessary and sufficient conditions for an act to be morally right,
regardless of whether the agent can tell in advance whether those
conditions are met. Just as the laws of physics govern golf ball
flight, but golfers need not calculate physical forces while planning
shots; so overall utility can determine which decisions are morally
right, even if agents need not calculate utilities while making
decisions. If the principle of utility is used as a criterion of the
right rather than as a decision procedure, then classical
utilitarianism does not require that anyone know the total consequences
of anything before making a decision.</p>

<p>

Furthermore, a utilitarian criterion of right implies that it would
not be morally right to use the principle of utility as a decision
procedure in cases where it would not maximize utility to try to
calculate utilities before acting. Utilitarians regularly argue that
most people in most circumstances ought not to try to calculate
utilities, because they are too likely to make serious miscalculations
that will lead them to perform actions that reduce utility. It is even
possible to hold that most agents usually ought to follow their moral
intuitions, because these intuitions evolved to lead us to perform acts
that maximize utility, at least in likely circumstances (Hare 1981,
46&ndash;47). Some utilitarians (Sidgwick 1907, 489&ndash;90) suggest that a
utilitarian decision procedure may be adopted as an esoteric morality
by an elite group that is better at calculating utilities, but
utilitarians can, instead, hold that nobody should use the principle of
utility as a decision procedure.</p>

<p>

This move is supposed to make consequentialism self-refuting,
according to some opponents. However, there is nothing incoherent about
proposing a decision procedure that is separate from one&rsquo;s criterion of
the right. Similar distinctions apply in other normative realms. The
criterion of a good stock investment is its total return, but the best
decision procedure still might be to reduce risk by buying an index
fund or blue-chip stocks. Criteria can, thus, be self-effacing without
being self-refuting (Parfit 1984, chs. 1 and 4).</p>

<p>

Others object that this move takes the force out of
consequentialism, because it leads agents to ignore consequentialism
when they make real decisions. However, a criterion of the right can be
useful at a higher level by helping us choose among available decision
procedures and refine our decision procedures as circumstances change
and we gain more experience and knowledge. Hence, most
consequentialists do not mind giving up consequentialism as a direct
decision procedure as long as consequences remain the criterion of
rightness (but see Chappell 2001).</p>

<p>

If overall utility is the criterion of moral rightness, then it
might seem that nobody could know what is morally right. If so,
classical utilitarianism leads to moral skepticism. However,
utilitarians insist that we can have strong reasons to believe that
certain acts reduce utility, even if we have not yet inspected or
predicted every consequence of those acts. For example, in normal
circumstances, if someone were to torture and kill his children, it is
possible that this would maximize utility, but that is very unlikely.
Maybe they would have grown up to be mass murders, but it is at least
as likely that they would grow up to cure serious diseases or do other great
things, and it is much more likely that they would have led normally
happy (or at least not destructive) lives. So observers as well as
agents have adequate reasons to believe that such acts are morally
wrong, according to act utilitarianism. In many other cases, it will
still be hard to tell whether an act will maximize utility, but that
shows only that there are severe limits to our knowledge of what is
morally right. That should be neither surprising nor problematic for
utilitarians.</p>

<p>

If utilitarians want their theory to allow more moral knowledge,
they can make a different kind of move by turning from actual
consequences to expected or expectable consequences. Suppose that Alice
finds a runaway teenager who asks for money to get home. Alice wants to
help and reasonably believes that buying a bus ticket home for this
runaway will help, so she buys a bus ticket and puts the runaway on the
bus. Unfortunately, the bus is involved in a freak accident, and the
runaway is killed. If actual consequences are what determine moral
wrongness, then it was morally wrong for Alice to buy the bus ticket
for this runaway. Opponents claim that this result is absurd enough to
refute classic utilitarianism.</p>

<p>

Some utilitarians bite the bullet and say that Alice&rsquo;s act was
morally wrong, but it was blameless wrongdoing, because her motives
were good, and she was not responsible, given that she could not have
foreseen that her act would cause harm. Since this theory makes actual
consequences determine moral rightness, it can be called <em>actual
consequentialism</em>.</p>

<p>

Other responses claim that moral rightness depends on foreseen,
foreseeable, intended, or likely consequences, rather than actual ones.
Imagine that Bob does not in fact foresee a bad consequence that would
make his act wrong if he did foresee it, but that Bob could easily have
foreseen this bad consequence if he had been paying attention. Maybe he
does not notice the rot on the hamburger he feeds to his kids which
makes them sick. If <em>foreseen</em> consequences are what matter,
then Bob&rsquo;s act is not morally wrong. If <em>foreseeable</em>
consequences are what matter, then Bob&rsquo;s act is morally wrong, because
the bad consequences were foreseeable. Now consider Bob&rsquo;s wife, Carol,
who notices that the meat is rotten but does not want to have to buy
more, so she feeds it to her children anyway, hoping that it will not
make them sick; but it does. Carol&rsquo;s act is morally wrong if foreseen
or foreseeable consequences are what matter, but not if what matter are
<em>intended</em> consequences, because she does not intend to make her
children sick. Finally, consider Bob and Carol&rsquo;s son Don, who does not
know enough about food to be able to know that eating rotten meat can
make people sick. If Don feeds the rotten meat to his little sister,
and it makes her sick, then the bad consequences are not intended,
foreseen, or even foreseeable by Don, but those bad results are still
objectively <em>likely</em> or <em>probable</em>, unlike the case of
Alice. Some philosophers deny that probability can be fully objective,
but at least the consequences here are foreseeable by others who are
more informed than Don can be at the time. For Don to feed the rotten
meat to his sister is, therefore, morally wrong if likely consequences
are what matter, but not morally wrong if what matter are foreseen or
foreseeable or intended consequences.</p>

<p>

Consequentialist moral theories that focus on actual or objectively
probable consequences are often described as <em>objective
consequentialism</em> (Railton 1984). In contrast, consequentialist
moral theories that focus on intended or foreseen consequences are
usually described as <em>subjective consequentialism</em>.
Consequentialist moral theories that focus on reasonably foreseeable
consequences are then not subjective insofar as they do not depend on
anything inside the actual subject&rsquo;s mind, but they are subjective
insofar as they do depend on which consequences this particular subject
would foresee if he or she were better informed or more rational.</p>

<p>

One final solution to these epistemological problems deploys the legal
notion of proximate cause. If consequentialists define consequences in
terms of what is caused (unlike Sosa 1993), then which future events
count as consequences is affected by which notion of causation is used
to define consequences. Suppose I give a set of steak knives to a
friend. Unforeseeably, when she opens my present, the decorative
pattern on the knives somehow reminds her of something horrible that
her husband did. This memory makes her so angry that she voluntarily
stabs and kills him with one of the knives. She would not have killed
her husband if I had given her spoons instead of knives.  Did my
decision or my act of giving her knives cause her husband&rsquo;s death?
Most people (and the law) would say that the cause was her act, not
mine. Why? One explanation is that her voluntary act intervened in the
causal chain between my act and her husband&rsquo;s death. Moreover, even if
she did not voluntarily kill him, but instead she slipped and fell on
the knives, thereby killing herself, my gift would still not be a
cause of her death, because the coincidence of her falling intervened
between my act and her death. The point is that, when voluntary acts
and coincidences intervene in certain causal chains, then the results
are not seen as caused by the acts further back in the chain of
necessary conditions (Hart and Honor&eacute; 1985). Now, if we assume
that an act must be such a proximate cause of a harm in order for that
harm to be a consequence of that act, then consequentialists can claim
that the moral rightness of that act is determined only by such
proximate consequences. This position, which might be called
<em>proximate consequentialism</em>, makes it much easier for agents
and observers to justify moral judgments of acts because it obviates
the need to predict non-proximate consequences in distant times and
places. Hence, this move is worth considering, even though it has
never been developed as far as I know and deviates far from traditional
consequentialism, which counts not only proximate consequences but all
upshots &mdash; that is, everything for which the act is a causally
necessary condition.</p>

<h2><a name="ConWhaRigRelRul">5. Consequences of What? Rights, Relativity, and Rules</a></h2>

<p>

Another problem for utilitarianism is that it seems to overlook
justice and rights. One common illustration is called Transplant.
Imagine that each of five patients in a hospital will die without an
organ transplant. The patient in Room 1 needs a heart, the patient in
Room 2 needs a liver, the patient in Room 3 needs a kidney, and so on.
The person in Room 6 is in the hospital for routine tests. Luckily (for
them, not for him!), his tissue is compatible with the other five
patients, and a specialist is available to transplant his organs into
the other five. This operation would save all five of their lives, while killing
the &ldquo;donor&rdquo;. There is no other way to save any of the other five
patients (Foot 1966, Thomson 1976; compare related cases in Carritt
1947 and McCloskey 1965).</p>

<p>

We need to add that the organ recipients will emerge healthy, the
source of the organs will remain secret, the doctor won&rsquo;t be caught or
punished for cutting up the &ldquo;donor&rdquo;, and the doctor knows all of this
to a high degree of probability (despite the fact that many others
will help in the operation). Still, with the right details filled in (no matter how unrealistic),
it looks as if cutting up the &ldquo;donor&rdquo; will maximize utility, since
five lives have more utility than one life (assuming that the five
lives do not contribute too much to overpopulation). If so, then
classical utilitarianism implies that it would not be morally wrong
for the doctor to perform the transplant and even that it would be
morally wrong for the doctor not to perform the transplant. Most
people find this result abominable. They take this example to show how
bad it can be when utilitarians overlook individual rights, such as
the unwilling donor&rsquo;s right to life.</p>

<p>

Utilitarians can bite the bullet, again. They can deny that it is
morally wrong to cut up the &ldquo;donor&rdquo; in these circumstances. Of course,
doctors still should not cut up their patients in anything close to
normal circumstances, but this example is so abnormal and unrealistic that we should
not expect our normal moral rules to apply, and we should not trust our
moral intuitions, which evolved to fit normal situations (Sprigge
1965). Many utilitarians are happy to reject common moral intuitions in
this case, like many others (cf. Singer 1974, Unger 1996, Norcross
1997).</p>

<p>

Most utilitarians lack such strong stomachs (or teeth), so they
modify utilitarianism to bring it in line with common moral intuitions,
including the intuition that doctors should not cut up innocent
patients. One attempt claims that a killing is worse than a death. The
doctor would have to kill the &ldquo;donor&rdquo; in order to prevent the deaths of
the five patients, but nobody is killed if the five patients die. If
one killing is worse than five deaths that do not involve killing, then
the world that results from the doctor performing the transplant is
worse than the world that results from the doctor not performing the
transplant. With this new theory of value, consequentialists can agree
with others that it is morally wrong for the doctor to cut up the
&ldquo;donor&rdquo; in this example.</p>

<p>

A modified example still seems problematic. Just suppose that the
five patients need a kidney, a lung, a heart, and so forth because they
were all victims of murder attempts. Then the world will contain the
five killings of them if they die, but not if they do not die. Thus,
even if killings are worse than deaths that are not killings, the world
will still be better overall (because it will contain fewer killings as
well as fewer deaths) if the doctor cuts up the &ldquo;donor&rdquo; to save the
five other patients. But most people still think it would be morally
wrong for the doctor to kill the one to prevent the five killings. The
reason is that it is not the doctor who kills the five, and the
doctor&rsquo;s duty seems to be to reduce the amount of killing that she
herself does. In this view, the doctor is not required to
<em>promote</em> life or decrease death or even decrease killing by
other people. The doctor is, instead, required to <em>honor</em> the
value of life by not causing loss of life (cf. Pettit 1997).</p>

<p>

This kind of case leads some consequentialists to introduce
agent-relativity into their theory of value (Sen 1982, Broome 1991,
Portmore 2001, 2003). To apply a consequentialist moral theory, we need
to compare the world with the transplant to the world without the
transplant. If this comparative evaluation must be agent-neutral, then,
if an observer judges that the world with the transplant is better, the
agent must make the same judgment, or else one of them is mistaken.
However, if such evaluations can be agent-relative, then it could be
legitimate for an observer to judge that the world with the transplant
is better (since it contains fewer killings by anyone), while it is
also legitimate for the doctor as agent to judge that the world with
the transplant is worse (because it includes a killing <em>by
him</em>). In other cases, such as competitions, it might maximize the
good from an agent&rsquo;s perspective to do an act, while maximizing
the good from an observer&rsquo;s perspective to stop the agent from
doing that very act. If such agent-relative value makes sense, then it
can be built into consequentialism to produce the claim that an act is
morally wrong if and only if the act&rsquo;s consequences include less
overall value from the perspective of the agent. This
<em>agent-relative consequentialism</em>, plus the claim that the world
with the transplant is worse from the perspective of the doctor, could
justify the doctor&rsquo;s judgment that it would be morally wrong for him to
perform the transplant. A key move here is to adopt the agent&rsquo;s
perspective in judging the agent&rsquo;s act. Agent-neutral
consequentialists judge all acts from the observer&rsquo;s perspective,
so they would judge the doctor&rsquo;s act to be wrong, since the world
with the transplant is better from an observer&rsquo;s perspective. In
contrast, an agent-relative approach requires observers to adopt the
doctor&rsquo;s perspective in judging whether it would be morally wrong for
the doctor to perform the transplant. This kind of agent-relative
consequentialism is then supposed to capture commonsense moral
intuitions in such cases.</p>

<p>

Agent-relativity is also supposed to solve other problems. W. D.
Ross (1930, 34&ndash;35) argued that, if breaking a promise created only
slightly more happiness overall than keeping the promise, then the
agent morally ought to break the promise according to classic
utilitarianism. This supposed counterexample cannot be avoided simply
by claiming that keeping promises has agent-neutral value, since
keeping one promise might prevent someone else from keeping another
promise. Still, agent-relative consequentialists can respond that
keeping a promise has great value from the perspective of the agent who
made the promise and chooses whether or not to keep it, so the world
where a promise is kept is better from the agent&rsquo;s perspective than
another world where the promise is not kept, unless enough other values
override the value of keeping the promise. In this way, agent-relative
consequentialists can explain why agents morally ought not to break
their promises in just the kind of case that Ross raised.</p>

<p>

Similarly, critics of utilitarianism often argue that utilitarians
cannot be good friends, because a good friend places more weight on the
welfare of his or her friends than on the welfare of strangers, but
utilitarianism requires impartiality among all people. However,
agent-relative consequentialists can assign more weight to the welfare
of a friend of an agent when assessing the value of the consequences of
that agent&rsquo;s acts. In this way, consequentialists try to capture common
moral intuitions about the duties of friendship (see also Jackson 1991).</p>

<p>

One final variation still causes trouble. Imagine that the doctor
herself wounded the five people who need organs. If the doctor does not
save their lives, then she will have killed them herself. In this case,
even if the doctor can disvalue killings by herself more than killings
by other people, the world still seems better from her own perspective
if she performs the transplant. Critics will object that it is,
nonetheless, morally wrong for the doctor to perform the transplant.
Many people will not find this intuition as clear as in the other
cases, but those who do find it immoral for the doctor to perform the
transplant even in this case will want to modify consequentialism in
some other way in order to yield the desired judgment.</p>

<p>

This problem cannot be solved by building rights or fairness or
desert into the theory of value. The five do not deserve to die, and
they do deserve their lives, just as much as the one does. Each option
violates someone&rsquo;s right not to be killed and is unfair to someone. So
consequentialists need more than just new values if they want to avoid
endorsing this transplant.</p>

<p>

One option is to go indirect. A <em>direct</em> consequentialist holds
that the moral qualities of something depend only on the consequences
of that very thing. Thus, a direct consequentialist about motives
holds that the moral qualities of a motive depend on the consequences
of that motive. A direct consequentialist about virtues holds that the
moral qualities of a character trait (such as whether or not it is a
moral virtue) depend on the consequences of that trait (Driver 2001a,
Hurka 2001, Jamieson 2005, Bradley 2005). A direct consequentialist
about acts holds that the moral qualities of an act depend on the
consequences of that act. Someone who adopts direct consequentialism
about everything is a <em>global</em> direct consequentialist (Pettit
and Smith 2000, Driver 2012).</p>

<p>

In contrast, an <em>indirect</em> consequentialist holds that the
moral qualities of something depend on the consequences of something
else. One indirect version of consequentialism is <em>motive
consequentialism</em>, which claims that the moral qualities of an act
depend on the consequences of the motive of that act (compare Adams
1976 and Sverdlik 2011). Another indirect version is <em>virtue
consequentialism</em>, which holds that whether an act is morally
right depends on whether it stems from or expresses a state of
character that maximizes good consequences and, hence, is a
virtue.</p>

<p>

The most common indirect consequentialism is <em>rule
consequentialism</em>, which makes the moral rightness of an act
depend on the consequences of a rule (Singer 1961). Since a rule is an abstract
entity, a rule by itself strictly has no consequences. Still,
<em>obedience rule consequentialists</em> can ask what would happen if
everybody obeyed a rule or what would happen if everybody violated a
rule. They might argue, for example, that theft is morally wrong
because it would be disastrous if everybody broke a rule against
theft. Often, however, it does not seem morally wrong to break a rule
even though it would cause disaster if everybody broke it. For
example, if everybody broke the rule &ldquo;Have some children&rdquo;,
then our species would die out, but that hardly shows it is morally
wrong not to have any children. Luckily, our species will not die out
if everyone is permitted not to have children, since enough people
want to have children. Thus, instead of asking, &ldquo;What would
happen if everybody did that?&rdquo;, rule consequentialists should
ask, &ldquo;What would happen if everybody were permitted to do
that?&rdquo; People are permitted to do what violates no accepted
rule, so asking what would happen if everybody were permitted to do an
act is just the flip side of asking what would happen if people
accepted a rule that forbids that act. Such <em>acceptance rule
consequentialists</em> then claim that an act is morally wrong if and
only if it violates a rule whose acceptance has better consequences
than the acceptance of any incompatible rule. In some accounts, a rule
is accepted when it is built into individual consciences (Brandt
1992). Other rule utilitarians, however, require that moral rules be
publicly known (Gert 2005; cf. Sinnott-Armstrong 2003b) or built into
public institutions (Rawls 1955). Then they hold what can be called
<em>public acceptance rule consequentialism</em>: an act is morally
wrong if and only if it violates a rule whose public acceptance
maximizes the good.</p>

<p>

The indirectness of such rule utilitarianism provides a way to remain
consequentialist and yet capture the common moral intuition that it is
immoral to perform the transplant in the above situation. Suppose
people generally accepted a rule that allows a doctor to transplant
organs from a healthy person without consent when the doctor believes
that this transplant will maximize utility. Widely accepting this rule
would lead to many transplants that do not maximize utility, since
doctors (like most people) are prone to errors in predicting
consequences and weighing utilities. Moreover, if the rule is publicly
known, then patients will fear that they might be used as organ
sources, so they would be less likely to go to a doctor when they need
one. The medical profession depends on trust that this public rule
would undermine. For such reasons, some rule utilitarians conclude
that it would not maximize utility for people generally to accept a
rule that allows doctors to transplant organs from unwilling
donors. If this claim is correct, then rule utilitarianism implies
that it is morally wrong for a particular doctor to use an unwilling
donor, even for a particular transplant that would have better
consequences than any alternative even from the doctor&rsquo;s own
perspective. Common moral intuition is thereby preserved.</p>

<p>

Rule utilitarianism faces several potential counterexamples (such as
whether public rules allowing slavery could sometimes maximize utility)
and needs to be formulated more precisely (particularly in order to
avoid collapsing into act-utilitarianism; cf. Lyons 1965). Such
details are discussed in another entry in this encyclopedia (see
Hooker on rule-consequentialism). Here I just want to point out that
direct consequentialists find it convoluted and implausible to judge a particular act by
the consequences of something else (Smart 1956). Why should mistakes
by other doctors in other cases make this doctor&rsquo;s act morally wrong,
when this doctor knows for sure that he is not mistaken in this case?
Rule consequentialists can respond that we should not claim special
rights or permissions that we are not willing to grant to every other
person, and that it is arrogant to think we are less prone to mistakes
than other people are. However, this doctor can reply that he is
willing to give everyone the right to violate the usual rules in the
rare cases when they do know for sure that violating those rules
really maximizes utility. Anyway, even if rule utilitarianism accords
with some common substantive moral intuitions, it still seems
counterintuitive in other ways. This makes it worthwhile to consider
how direct consequentialists can bring their views in line with common
moral intuitions, and whether they need to do so.</p>

<h2><a name="ConWhoLimDemMor">6. Consequences for Whom? Limiting the Demands of Morality</a></h2>

<p>

Another popular charge is that classic utilitarianism demands too
much, because it requires us to do acts that are or should be moral
options (neither obligatory nor forbidden). (Scheffler 1982) For
example, imagine that my old shoes are serviceable but dirty, so I want
a new pair of shoes that costs $100. I could wear my old shoes and give
the $100 to a charity that will use my money to save someone else&rsquo;s
life. It would seem to maximize utility for me to give the $100 to the
charity. If it is morally wrong to do anything other than what
maximizes utility, then it is morally wrong for me to buy the shoes.
But buying the shoes does not seem morally wrong. It might be morally
better to give the money to charity, but such contributions seem
supererogatory, that is, above and beyond the call of duty. Of course,
there are many more cases like this. When I watch television, I always
(or almost always) could do more good by helping others, but it does
not seem morally wrong to watch television. When I choose to teach
philosophy rather than working for CARE or the Peace Corps, my choice
probably fails to maximize utility overall. If we were required to
maximize utility, then we would have to make very different choices in
many areas of our lives. The requirement to maximize utility, thus,
strikes many people as too demanding because it interferes with the
personal decisions that most of us feel should be left up to the
individual.</p>

<p>

Some utilitarians respond by arguing that we really are morally
required to change our lives so as to do a lot more to increase
overall utility (see Kagan 1989, P. Singer 1993, and Unger 1996). Such
hard-liners claim that most of what most people do is morally wrong,
because most people rarely maximize utility. Some such wrongdoing
might be blameless when agents act from innocent or even desirable
motives, but it is still supposed to be moral wrongdoing. Opponents of
utilitarianism find this claim implausible, but it is not obvious that
their counter-utilitarian intuitions are reliable or well-grounded
(Murphy 2000, chs. 1&ndash;4; cf. Mulgan 2001, Singer 2005, Greene 2013).</p>

<p>

Other utilitarians blunt the force of the demandingness objection by
limiting direct utilitarianism to what people morally <em>ought</em> to do.
Even if we morally ought to maximize utility, it need not be morally
wrong to fail to maximize utility. John Stuart Mill, for example,
argued that an act is morally <em>wrong</em> only when both it fails to
maximize utility and its agent is liable to punishment for the failure
(Mill 1861). It does not always maximize utility to punish people for
failing to maximize utility. Thus, on this
view, it is not always morally wrong to fail to do what one morally
ought to do. If Mill is correct about this, then utilitarians can say
that we ought to give much more to charity, but we are not required or
obliged to do so, and failing to do so is not morally wrong (cf. Sinnott-Armstrong 2005).</p>

<p>

Many utilitarians still want to avoid the claim that we morally
ought to give so much to charity. One way around this claim uses a
rule-utilitarian theory of what we morally ought to do. If it costs too
much to internalize rules implying that we ought to give so much to
charity, then, according to such rule-utilitarianism, it is not true
that we ought to give so much to charity (Hooker 2000, ch. 8).</p>

<p>

Another route follows an agent-relative theory of value. If there is
more value in benefiting oneself or one&rsquo;s family and friends than
there is disvalue in letting strangers die (without killing them),
then spending resources on oneself or one&rsquo;s family and friends would
maximize the good. A problem is that such consequentialism would seem
to imply that we morally ought not to contribute those resources to
charity, although such contributions seem at least permissible.</p>

<p>

More personal leeway could also be allowed by deploying the legal
notion of proximate causation. When a starving stranger would stay
alive if and only if one contributed to a charity, contributing to the
charity still need not be the proximate cause of the stranger&rsquo;s life,
and failing to contribute need not be the proximate cause of his or her
death. Thus, if an act is morally right when it includes the most net
good in its proximate consequences, then it might not be morally wrong
either to contribute to the charity or to fail to do so. This potential position, as mentioned above, has not yet been developed, as far as I know.</p>

<p>

Yet another way to reach this conclusion is to give up maximization
and to hold instead that we morally ought to do what creates enough
utility. This position is often described as <em>satisficing
consequentialism</em> (Slote 1984). According to satisficing
consequentialism, it is not morally wrong to fail to contribute to a
charity if one contributes enough to other charities and if the money
or time that one could contribute does create enough good, so it is not
just wasted. (For criticisms, see Bradley 2006.) A related
position is <em>progressive consequentialism</em>, which holds that we
morally ought to improve the world or make it better than it would be
if we did nothing, but we don&rsquo;t have to improve it as much as we can
(Elliot and Jamieson, 2009). Both satisficing and progressive
consequentialism allow us to devote some of our time and money to
personal projects that do not maximize overall good.</p>

<p> A more radical set of proposals confines consequentialism to judgements about how good an act is on a scale (Norcross 2006) or to degrees of wrongness and rightness (Sinhababu 2018). A consequentialist can refuse to say whether it is absolutely right or wrong to give $1000 to charity, for example, but still say that giving $1000 to charity is better and more right than giving only $100 and simultaneously worse as well as more wrong than giving $10,000. A related contrastivist consequentialism could say that one ought to give $1000 in contrast with $100 but not in contrast with $10,000 (cf. Snedegar 2017).</p>

<p>

Opponents still object that all such consequentialist theories are
misdirected. When I decide to visit a friend instead of working for a
charity, I can know that my act is not immoral even if I have not
calculated that the visit will create enough overall good or that it
will improve the world. These critics hold that friendship requires us
to do certain favors for friends without weighing our friends&rsquo; welfare
impartially against the welfare of strangers. Similarly, if I need to
choose between saving my drowning wife and saving a drowning stranger,
it would be &ldquo;one thought too many&rdquo; (Williams 1981) for me to calculate
the consequences of each act. I morally should save my wife
straightaway without calculating utilities.</p>

<p>

In response, utilitarians can remind critics that the principle of
utility is intended as only a criterion of right and not as a decision
procedure, so utilitarianism does not imply that people ought to
calculate utilities before acting (Railton 1984). Consequentialists can
also allow the special perspective of a friend or spouse to be
reflected in agent-relative value assessments (Sen 1982, Broome 1991,
Portmore 2001, 2003) or probability assessments (Jackson 1991). It
remains controversial, however, whether any form of consequentialism
can adequately incorporate common moral intuitions about
friendship.</p>

<h2><a name="ArgCon">7. Arguments for Consequentialism</a></h2>

<p>

Even if consequentialists can accommodate or explain away common
moral intuitions, that might seem only to answer objections without yet
giving any positive reason to accept consequentialism. However, most
people begin with the <em>presumption</em> that we morally ought to
make the world better when we can. The question then is only whether
any moral constraints or moral options need to be added to the basic
consequentialist factor in moral reasoning. (Kagan 1989, 1998) If no
objection reveals any need for anything beyond consequences, then
consequences alone seem to determine what is morally right or wrong,
just as consequentialists claim.</p>

<p>

This line of reasoning will not convince opponents who remain
unsatisfied by consequentialist responses to objections. Moreover, even
if consequentialists do respond adequately to every proposed objection,
that would not show that consequentialism is correct or even
defensible. It might face new problems that nobody has yet recognized.
Even if every possible objection is refuted, we might have no reason to
reject consequentialism but still no reason to accept it.</p>

<p>

In case a positive reason is needed, consequentialists present a
wide variety of arguments. One common move attacks opponents. If the
only plausible options in moral theory lie on a certain list (say,
Kantianism, contractarianism, virtue theory, pluralistic intuitionism,
and consequentialism), then consequentialists can argue for their own
theory by criticizing the others. This <em>disjunctive syllogism</em>
or <em>process of elimination</em> will be only as strong as the set of
objections to the alternatives, and the argument fails if even one
competitor survives. Moreover, the argument assumes that the original
list is complete. It is hard to see how that assumption could be
justified.</p>

<p>

Consequentialism also might be supported by an <em>inference to the
best explanation</em> of our moral intuitions. This argument might
surprise those who think of consequentialism as counterintuitive, but
in fact consequentialists can explain many moral intuitions that
trouble deontological theories. Moderate deontologists, for example,
often judge that it is morally wrong to kill one person to save five
but not morally wrong to kill one person to save a million. They never
specify the line between what is morally wrong and what is not morally
wrong, and it is hard to imagine any non-arbitrary way for
deontologists to justify a cutoff point. In contrast,
consequentialists can simply say that the line belongs wherever the
benefits outweigh the costs (including any bad side
effects). Similarly, when two promises conflict, it often seems clear
which one we should keep, and that intuition can often be explained by
the amount of harm that would be caused by breaking each promise. In
contrast, deontologists are hard pressed to explain which promise is
overriding if the reason to keep each promise is simply that it was
made (Sinnott-Armstrong 2009).  If consequentialists can better
explain more common moral intuitions, then consequentialism might have
more explanatory coherence overall, despite being counterintuitive in
some cases. (Compare Sidgwick 1907, Book IV, Chap. III; and Sverdlik
2011.) And even if act consequentialists cannot argue in this way, it
still might work for rule consequentialists (such as Hooker 2000).</p>

<p>

Consequentialists also might be supported by <em>deductive</em>
arguments from abstract moral intuitions. Sidgwick (1907, Book III,
Chap. XIII) seemed to think that the principle of utility follows from
certain very general self-evident principles, including
universalizability (if an act ought to be done, then every other act
that resembles it in all relevant respects also ought to be done),
rationality (one ought to aim at the good generally rather than at any
particular part of the good), and equality (&ldquo;the good of any one
individual is of no more importance, from the point of view ... of the
Universe, than the good of any other&rdquo;).</p>

<p>

Other consequentialists are more skeptical about moral intuitions, so
they seek foundations outside morality, either in non-normative facts
or in non-moral norms. Mill (1861) is infamous for his
&ldquo;proof&rdquo; of the principle of utility from empirical
observations about what we desire (cf. Sayre-McCord 2001). In
contrast, Hare (1963, 1981) tries to derive his version of
utilitarianism from substantively neutral accounts of morality, of
moral language, and of rationality (cf. Sinnott-Armstrong
2001). Similarly, Gewirth (1978) tries to derive his variant of
consequentialism from metaphysical truths about actions.</p>

<p>

Yet another argument for a kind of consequentialism is
<em>contractarian</em>. Harsanyi (1977, 1978) argues that all informed,
rational people whose impartiality is ensured because they do not know
their place in society would favor a kind of consequentialism. Broome
(1991) elaborates and extends Harsanyi&rsquo;s argument.</p>

<p>

Other forms of arguments have also been invoked on behalf of
consequentialism (e.g. Cummiskey 1996, P. Singer 1993;
Sinnott-Armstrong 1992). However, each of these arguments has also
been subjected to criticisms.</p>

<p>

Even if none of these arguments proves consequentialism, there still
might be no adequate reason to deny consequentialism. We might have no
reason either to deny consequentialism or to assert it.
Consequentialism could then remain a live option even if it is not
proven.</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Gilbert Ryle</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Anecdotal evidence (thanks to David Pears) is that Elizabeth Anscombe
was scathing about <em>The Concept of Mind</em> when it was published.
But what of Wittgenstein himself? On the one hand, in his letters he
seemed dismissive of Ryle&rsquo;s work (McGuinness and Von Wright, 284);
on the other, he is quoted (Monk, 436) as having told Ryle&rsquo;s
cousin that Ryle was one of only two philosophers who understood his
work. (Monk wonders whether this was a matter of mere <em>politesse
</em>but there is reason to believe it was not.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>  Compare Wittgenstein:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The fundamental fact here is that we lay down rules, a technique, for
a game, and that then when we follow the rules, things do not turn out
as we assumed. That we are therefore entangled in our own rules.</p>

<p>
This entanglement in our rules is what we want to understand (i.e. get
a clear view of). (Wittgenstein, &sect;125)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Compare Wittgenstein: &ldquo;The <em>preconceived idea</em> of
crystalline purity (of logic) can only be removed by turning our whole
examination round&hellip;The philosophy of logic speaks of sentences
and words in exactly the sense in which we speak of them in ordinary
life&hellip;&rdquo; <em>(</em>Wittgenstein, &sect;108).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Kim describes in clear terms what the problem is and defends a
(functional-reductive) version of physicalism as a solution to the
problem.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Ryle&rsquo;s arguments against this supposition are in the chapters on
Emotion and the Will (1949a). See Tanney 2009a for an attempt to
capture the spirit of this critique.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 The admission that there may be some mental states (as Freud has
shown) that are not within the sight of our &ldquo;mental eye&rdquo;
as such, is a mere variation, rather than a major deviation, Ryle
points out, from the basic framework of the Official Doctrine.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 In contemporary versions, this feature becomes a special mental
property which is nonetheless tied (identical to, or realised by)
physical properties (which are, in turn, widely supposed to depend
upon the microphysical properties of the individuals). See Kim.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 See Tanney 2009b for further discussion.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 The qualifier &lsquo;almost&rsquo; is needed in order to accommodate
the idea that the inner processes are supposed to be content-bearing.
Indeed, the category-error reaches its apex with the idea that mental
predicates pick out inner, casually-efficacious, (probably at bottom)
physical events with semantic or representational content.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 It is also usually conceded that the project of analysing actions in
terms of muscular behaviour is doomed because there will be any number
of different physical behaviours that could be involved, say, in an
action (like paying a debt) and because identical physical behaviours
admit of various action-descriptions.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Or, as he also puts it, the <em>Occamist</em> against the
<em>Platonist</em> or <em>Cartesian</em>, or the <em>deflators</em>
against the <em>inflators</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Ryle does, however, want to deny that in imagining, pretending, and
dreaming there is something shadowy that we see, hear, taste, smell,
or feel (as we would deny, when a mock-murder is staged, that there is
something shadowy that is really murdered). Actors who portray
murderers do not commit murders with the elusive quality of being
shams: they pretend to murder; they seem to murder. Just as
stage-murders are not murders, imagined sights and sounds are not
sights or sounds. Therefore they are not, as Hume suggested, vivid or
less vivid sights or sounds. Nor, thus, are they private.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There is no answer to the spurious question &lsquo;Where have you
deposited the victim of your mock-murder?&rsquo; since there was no
victim. There is no answer to the spurious question, &lsquo;Where do
the objects reside that we fancy we see?&rsquo; since there are no
such objects. (1949a, 237)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 The extent to which Ryle sides with the (then still unpublished work
of) later Wittgenstein in rejecting descendents of Mill&rsquo;s theory
of meaning is most stark in his &ldquo;scolding&rdquo; review of
Carnap&rsquo;s <em>Meaning and Necessity</em> which he characterises as
&ldquo;an astonishing blend of technical sophistication with
philosophical na&iuml;vet&eacute;&rdquo; (1949b, 235).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Ryle is here, as elsewhere, insisting on the idea that the primary
role of certain (significant, affirmative) indicative sentences, even
if they can be construed as having truth-values and as fact-stating,
is often different. It is partly because of the multiplicity of jobs
he accords to sentences in the region of discourses under
consideration, but also for other reasons, that it is difficult to
locate his position on the map charted by the realists and irrealists.
This topic needs much more development, but see Tanney 2008a for
additional discussion.</p>
</div>

<h3>Notes to Supplement on Some Problems in Contemporary Work on Knowing-How and Knowing-That</h3>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="knowing-how.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 For a recent statement of&nbsp;the doctrine that (it is argued here)
Ryle dismisses, consider the opening words of Stanley (2011a, 207):
&ldquo;Propositional knowledge is the knowledge attributed by
sentences of the form &lsquo;x knows that p&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="knowing-how.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 In the Introduction to his seminal <em>The Language of Thought,</em>
Fodor (1975, 5) remarks that it is difficult to think of an area of
cognitive psychology in which the array of arguments in <em>The
Concept of Mind</em> would not apply or in which Ryle does not apply
them. If, indeed, it is a mistake to give mechanistic answers to (what
Ryle considers instead to be) conceptual questions then, Fodor
acknowledges, &ldquo;I am in trouble&rdquo;, and spends a great deal
of energy responding to them. See Tanney (2011) for an argument that
these responses are not successful and for a more in-depth discussion
of Ryle&rsquo;s regress argument. See Tanney (1998) for a detailed
criticism of the introduction of mental representations.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="knowing-how.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Ryle&rsquo;s (1965, 161) discussion begins,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Even though we aim to be as factual or scientific as possible when we
start to think about thoughts, perceptions, memories, resolutions and
the rest, we still know, so to speak, in our bones that our theories
about them, because couched in factual idioms echoing those of
chemistry, mechanics, hydraulics or physiology, have inevitably
omitted something that is cardinal to their being actions, thoughts,
perceptions, memories or resolutions at all. For such theories,
couched in such idioms, are necessarily silent about the purposive
nature of our doings, thinkings, perceivings, etc. It is essential to
them that they merit good, medium or bad marks. In our actions, unlike
our mere reactions, either there is success or there is failure, and
either dexterity or clumsiness. &hellip;Now the same thing is true of
thoughts&hellip;. Thinking, like fencing and skating, is a consortium
of competences and skills. Like them, it has tasks which it may
accomplish or may fail to do so. It has room in it, therefore, for
high and low degrees of these competences and skills, i.e. of low and
high degrees of stupidity and silliness. In our thinking we exercise
good, moderate or bad craftsmanship.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="knowing-how.html#ref-18">18.</a>&nbsp;
 For the contrasting view, consider&nbsp;the interpretation of Bengson
and Moffett&nbsp;(ibid, 7)&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ryle&rsquo;s view of
Intellectualism as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
As suggested by [the] quotation from Ryle [&ldquo;there are many
activities which directly display qualities of mind which are neither
intellectual operations nor yet effects of intellectual
operations&rdquo;], intellectualism can be understood as the
conjunction of two theses, the first of which concerns the
aforementioned states of Intelligence and the second of which concerns
the relation between these states and action (the exercise of
Intelligence):</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>
[I<sub>MIND</sub>] A state &sigma; is a state of Intelligence if and
only if &sigma; is or involves[&hellip;] a certain type of internal
state of engaging propositional content.</p>

<p>
[I<sub>ACTION</sub>] An individual x exercises a state of Intelligence
in performing an action &phi; (i.e., x &phi;-s Intelligently) if and
only if x &phi;-s and x has some state &sigma; such that (i) &sigma;
is or involves a certain type of internal state of engaging
propositional content and (ii) &sigma; is appropriately causally (or
otherwise explanatorily[&hellip;]) related to the production of
&phi;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note also Stanley&rsquo;s (2011a, 207-208) description of Ryle&rsquo;s
position, introducing the notion of cogntive states:</p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;According to Gilbert Ryle&hellip;knowing how to F is not a
species of propositional knowledge. Instead, knowing how is a
distinctive kind of non-propositional mental state. On this view,
knowing how to find coffee in New York City is a fundamentally
different kind of cognitive state from [others Stanley describes]. The
latter are propositional knowledge states, whereas the former is not;
the fact that it is expressed with the same word is an accident of the
English language.&rdquo;
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="knowing-how.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Consider the argument here in relation to Ginet&rsquo;s (1975, 7)
claim (and others, cited in Bengson and Moffett (2012, 22) and Fantl
(2017)) that Ryle&rsquo;s regress does not touch on the possibility
that I manifest my knowledge-that in any number of ways without prior
theoretical operations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I exercise (or manifest) my knowledge that one can get the door open
by turning the knob and pushing it (as well as my knowledge that there
is a door there) by performing that operation quite automatically as I
leave the room; and I may do this, of course, without formulating (in
my mind or out loud) that proposition or any other relevant
proposition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What&nbsp;is to count as manifesting knowledge-that? Is it that, for
example, &ldquo;[t]he intellectual state&mdash;a propositional
attitude&mdash;is such that it is simply exercised, and its being
exercised leads directly (non-Intelligently) to an Intelligent
action&rdquo; (Bengson and Moffett, 2012, p. 22)? It is not clear
either what explanatory work this accomplishes, or what would count as
evidence for it.&nbsp; Perhaps Ginet&rsquo;s example is illustrative
instead, as suggested here,&nbsp;of nothing more than the unremarkable
interchangeability of these expressions in certain contexts.</p>

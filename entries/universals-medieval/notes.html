<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">The Medieval Problem of Universals</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 In a somewhat free translation: &ldquo;I like Plato, but I like the
truth even more.&rdquo; Cf. Aristotle, <em>The Nicomachean
Ethics</em>, 1096a15, in <em>The Complete Works of Aristotle</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 These are the opposing, yet complementary attitudes (universals come
&ldquo;from above&rdquo;, for Plato, and &ldquo;from below&rdquo;, for
Aristotle) that are famously immortalized in the gestures of the two
philosophers in the center of Raphael&rsquo;s picture &ldquo;The
School of Athens&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 To be sure, there were medieval authors who were skeptical about the
reconcilability of Plato and Aristotle on the issue of universals. Cf.
the following remark by John of Salisbury (ca. 1120-1180):
&ldquo;Bernard of Chartres and his students worked hard to reconcile
Aristotle and Plato. But in my judgment they arrived late, so they
strove in vain to reconcile two dead men, who could have reconciled as
long as they were alive, but disagreed.&rdquo; John of Salisbury,
<em>Metalogicon</em>, bk. 2, c. 17, 875d22-25.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Cf.: &ldquo;In the second place it is clear what those professors
mean who say that there are three sorts of universals, namely, before
the individual thing, as an idea, in the thing, as a form communicated
to many things, and after the thing, as the species or sign of the
former.&rdquo; John Wyclif, <em>Tractatus de Universalibus</em>, c. 2,
p. 69. Cf. also: &ldquo;To these two kinds of universals
[Plato&rsquo;s and Aristotle&rsquo;s], a third is added, namely, the
species in the understanding abstracted from the things is called
universal, because it is related to many things, not because it is
predicated of many, but because it is similar to many. &hellip; And
perhaps this is whence the distinction originated that there are three
kinds of universals: before the thing, in the thing, and after the
thing. For a universal in the first way is before the thing, because
it causes things. In the second way it is in the thing, because it is
the same essence as the things. In the third way it is after the
thing, because it is a species abstracted from the things and caused
by them.&rdquo; Giles of Rome, <em>In Primum Librum Sententiarum</em>,
1SN, d. 19, pars 2, q. 1. <em>Utrum in divinis sit totum
universale?</em>. Concerning alleged &ldquo;ontological
extremities&rdquo; in mediaeval philosophy see J. A. Trentman&rsquo;s
<em>Introduction</em> to his edition of Vincent Ferrer&rsquo;s
<em>Tractatus de Suppositionibus</em>, esp. pp. 20-30.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Notable exceptions would be Ockham, and his followers, such as Peter
of Ailly, John Gerson, and Gabriel Biel. See Ockham,
<em>Ordinatio</em> I, d. 35, q. 5, and Biel, <em>Collectorium</em> I,
d. 35, q. 5. These authors argue that only singular creatures have
ideas in the divine mind (which they identify with the singular
creatures themselves as they are eternally pre-cognized by God), but
neither their species, nor their genera do. To be sure, since created
intellects do form universal concepts of singulars, and God does have
cognition of those concepts in each singular created mind from
eternity, in a roundabout way these authors still concede that there
are universals in the divine mind. However, Ockham also claims that in
the divine mind these universals do not function as universal
exemplars, as they do in the minds of created agents. The basis of the
claim is that for Ockham, the intuitive, singular cognition of
singulars is superior to the abstractive, universal cognition of the
same. But regardless of such details, the point is that even such
hardheaded nominalists would not directly go against the authority of
St. Augustine on this issue, for which see the section on divine ideas
below.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 In fact, by the 12<sup>th</sup> century the irresistible challenge
posed by Porphyry&rsquo;s questions yielded a proliferation of answers
that John of Salisbury found pedagogically completely unjustifiable,
complaining in his <em>Metalogicon</em> that his contemporaries&rsquo;
endless discussions of universals in connection with what was supposed
to be an introductory logic text placed &ldquo;unbearable burden on
the tender shoulders of their students&rdquo; (<em>onera importabilia
teneris auditorum humeris imponunt</em>). <em>op. cit.</em>, bk. 2, c.
19, 877a.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 As Paul Spade has pointed out in his careful analysis of
Boethius&rsquo; argument, this characterization of what a universal is
derives from Porphyry&rsquo;s commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Categories.</em> See, Spade 1996b.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Although Boethius does not explicitly formulate his argument in terms
of the distinctness and identity of the acts of being of the entities
in question, in the conclusion of his argument, he quite explicitly
alludes to the Aristotelian principle of the convertibility of unity
and being. See Spade 1996b, p. 22 (12). In any case, this
reformulation of Boethius&rsquo; argument is just my attempt at
clarifying what Boethius may have meant by the requirement of
metaphysical &ldquo;constitutiveness&rdquo; that accounts for the key
motive in the argument which Paul Spade very aptly called the
&ldquo;contagiousness&rdquo; of the plurality of the particulars.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 To be sure, Boethius does not explicitly talk about a
<em>collection</em> here, but this suggestion is certainly very
similar to those later collection-theories which Abelard vehemently
(and quite effectively) criticized. See <em>Five Texts</em> (Spade
1994), pp. 35-37. In any case, in Boethius&rsquo; argument nothing
depends on whether the several items demanding a genus are grouped
together into a collection, a quasi-entity with its own
less-than-numerical quasi-unity. The point is that according to the
assumption of this part of the argument, the term &lsquo;genus&rsquo;
has to stand for a number of distinct entities, no matter whether they
are taken to form a collection or not.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 This summary provides the overall structure of Boethius&rsquo;
argument. In the reconstruction above I did not follow the order of
Boethius&rsquo; actual presentation; I merely summarized what I take
to be the gist of Boethius&rsquo; reasoning. For an intriguing and
thoroughgoing discussion of the interpretational possibilities as to
the actual &ldquo;fine-structure&rdquo; of Boethius&rsquo;
argumentation, see again Spade 1996b.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 The same solution recurs, in ever more refined forms, e.g., in
Abelard <em>Five Texts</em> (Spade 1994, p. 48), John of Salisbury
(<em>Metalogicon</em>, bk. 2, c. 20, 877c7-878a9), and Aquinas (ST1,
q. 85, a. 1, ad 1-um.).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 To be sure, I may still be mistaken about <em>what</em> a man
<em>is</em>. But that, again, would be a case of forming a judgment,
as opposed to simply conceiving of man without any judgment
whatsoever. The point is that by an act of simple apprehension I
either do conceive of a certain (kind of) thing, or I don&rsquo;t. If
I do, then in this act there cannot be falsity unless I make a
judgment about the thing conceived; if I don&rsquo;t, then I literally
have no idea of the thing, so I will certainly not make a judgment
about it, let alone a false one.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Note that Berkeley&rsquo;s famous criticism of the Lockean conception
of abstraction does not apply here, for abstraction in this sense, as
selective intellectual attention, was admitted even by George Berkeley
in a significant insertion in the second edition of the
<em>Introduction</em> to his <em>Principles</em>. See George Berkeley:
<em>A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge</em>, p.
16.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 The tradition goes back to Philo of Alexandria, and the Alexandrian
school of Ammonius Saccas. See Spade 1985, p. 67. An excellent,
detailed discussion of Greek and Arab Neo-Platonism is provided in
Libera 1996. Interestingly, Aquinas, following Averroes, attributes
this theory to Aristotle. Cf. 1SN, d. 36, q. 2, a. 1, ad 1-um. Domingo
Soto, besides referring to the <em>locus classicus</em> from Augustine
quoted below, indicates that he also found the same doctrine in the
&ldquo;through and through Platonic&rdquo; (<em>ubique
Platonicus</em>) Seneca. Cf. Soto, D., <em>In Porphyrii Isagogen,
Aristotelis Categorias, librosque de Demonstratione, Commentaria</em>,
p. 30 I. For Seneca, see, e.g., <em>Ad Lucilium Epistulae
Morales,</em> lxx.7; lxv. 4-7. Seneca is also quoted by Ockham and
Biel in the places referred to in n. 5 above.</p>

 <em>On Eighty-Three Different Questions</em>, q. 46, 2, translated by
P. V. Spade in Spade 1985 (Other Internet Resources), p. 383, from
Augustine, <em>De diversis quaestionibus octoginta tribus</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 Quite significantly, Aquinas quotes Augustine as his authority for
this position: &ldquo;Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 6,7): &lsquo;God is
truly and absolutely simple.&rsquo;&rdquo; ST1, q. 3, a. 7, sc. (See
the whole question for Aquinas&rsquo; detailed arguments for
God&rsquo;s simplicity.)</p>

(henceforth HQO), 2, a. 65, q. 5; John Duns Scotus, <em>Op. Oxon</em>.
lb. 1, d. 35, q. <em>unica</em>. Thomas of Sutton,
<em>Quodlibeta</em>, IV, q. 5. For Aquinas&rsquo; detailed discussion
of the issue one should check 1SN, d. 36, q. 2, aa. 1-3.</p>

 Note that this premise merely assumes the abstraction of the concept
of some sort of unity, found, for example, in the experience of single
bodies (which really <em>is</em> common experience), and not the
formation of the concept of absolute unity, which would require (at
least) the further steps indicated below. Of course, the premise also
presumes the Aristotelian conception that the intellective soul has an
active intellect, the active faculty enabling it to perform
abstraction.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 ST1, q. 84, a. 5. In his commentary on Aquinas&rsquo;s relevant
remarks, Robert Pasnau objected to this characterization in the
following way: &ldquo;&hellip; I would contrast a naturalistic
interpretation with a supernatural one (see <em>Loquendo
naturaliter</em>, p. 202), and insist that Aquinas sees something
supernatural at work in the operation of the agent intellect,
something that cannot be explained, except by a raw appeal to our
participating in the divine light. At this point there is no further
philosophical account to be had, and so I find it misleading to refer
to Aquinas&rsquo;s interpretation as &lsquo;naturalistic&rsquo;&rdquo;
(Pasnau, 2002, p. 450). However, on my reading of Aquinas, here he
merely gives a tip of the hat to Augustine&rsquo;s doctrine, while at
the same time he respectfully rejects it. Concept acquisition and
understanding in possession of concepts are the natural operations of
the human mind (comprising both the agent and the possible intellect),
without any direct infusion of supernatural &ldquo;light&rdquo;: for
Aquinas, our intelligible species are genuinely acquired from
experience through the natural operation of the agent intellect
(namely, abstraction), they are not infused &ldquo;from above&rdquo;,
and once acquired, they are naturally utilized by the possible
intellect in its three operations distinguished by Aristotle (simple
apprehension, judgment formation, and reasoning). To be sure, the way
these natural operations work also provides proofs for Aquinas that
the human intellect is immaterial, and so in that sense it is elevated
above any corporeal, material nature. And in this sense (but in this
sense alone) it more intimately participates in the immaterial divine
nature than any corporeal nature possibly can. In any case, just to
make my point clear, when I claim that Aquinas provides a
&lsquo;naturalistic interpretation&rsquo; of illumination, I merely
want to stress (apparently in genuine contrast to Pasnau&rsquo;s
reading of Aquinas) that the natural operation of the agent intellect,
namely, abstraction, would for Aquinas account for the possibility of
universal concept formation without any reliance on some direct,
immediate divine action on the human mind (planting some information
in the human mind that it could not acquire from experience), in
contrast to Augustine&rsquo;s account that would require precisely
this sort of direct divine influence (as is also clear from Matthew of
Aquasparta&rsquo;s and Henry of Ghent&rsquo;s articulation of the
Augustinian position discussed below). But perhaps our disagreement
with Pasnau is still only verbal, merely depending on how much we want
to read into the adjective &ldquo;naturalistic&rdquo;.</p>

 An excellent collection of relevant texts can be found in

 The allusion to Descartes (with the phrase &ldquo;clear and
distinct&rdquo;) is intended. For Descartes&rsquo; &ldquo;Augustinian
roots&rdquo; see Menn, S.: Descartes and Augustine, (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1998). It is worth noting here that
Henry&rsquo;s distinction between these two sorts of concepts provides
an interesting solution to what in modern philosophy is usually
referred to as &ldquo;the paradox of analysis&rdquo;. The paradox
consists in the puzzling phenomenon that correct conceptual analyses
can be informative. For example, &lsquo;circle&rsquo; is correctly
analyzed as &lsquo;locus of points equidistant from a given
point&rsquo;. Still, a person may have the concept of
&lsquo;circle&rsquo;, and the concept of &lsquo;circle&rsquo; is
nothing but the concept of &lsquo;locus of points equidistant from a
given point&rsquo;, yet the person may genuinely learn something when
first instructed about this analysis. Henry would say that although
the simple concept of &lsquo;circle&rsquo; and its analysis do express
the same concept, the simple concept without its analysis is just an
initial, vague impression of visible circles on the mind, which does
not enable one to recognize the pure truth of what a circle is,
whereas with the analysis the same concept will enable the mind to
deliver sound judgment on the pure truth of the thing, in the form of
a priori geometrical principles and conclusions.</p>

 This is also what is happening in the Platonic dialogues, where the
interlocutors first start out with all confidence in having some
definite conception of the subject matter of the discussion, but when
it comes to the point of having to provide an essential definition of
the subject, they all end up in confusion and embarrassment,
apparently lacking the definite concept they thought they had, after
which they start seeking &ldquo;illumination&rdquo; or
&ldquo;recollection&rdquo; throughout the discussion, to reach the

 As John of Salisbury writes: &ldquo;&hellip;everybody follows
Aristotle&rdquo; (&hellip;<em>omnes Aristotelem profitentur</em>).
<em>Metalogicon</em>, bk. 2, c. 19, 877a18.</p>

 No wonder that in modern philosophies of language, mostly inspired by
the &ldquo;collection-theorist&rdquo; view of quantification theory,
we have the persistent problem of providing a principled distinction
between essential and non-essential predicates.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>
 The term <em>status</em> (the plural form of which is also
<em>status</em>, pronounced with a long <em>u</em>) designates just a
state of a thing, the way the thing is. It is this simple, intuitive
idea that gains some further, technical significance in the context of
Abelard&rsquo;s theory.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-31">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a>
 Cf. Aristotle<em>, Physics,</em> 2, c. 3, 195 a13-14. Note that the
<em>Physics</em> was not yet available in Abelard&rsquo;s time.
Abelard&rsquo;s own examples include being flogged for not appearing
in court, being hanged for stealing, dying because of not eating, and
being damned for not acting rightly. In any case, Abelard&rsquo;s
point clearly is that he takes the causal relation to hold between the
<em>significata</em> of whole propositions, regardless of the
particular content of these propositions, or the particular kind of
causality involved.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-32">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-32">32.</a>
 This will immediately raise the problem whether the <em>status</em>
of created things are there before their creation, and if not (since
nothing other than God can be coeternal with God), then whether
God&rsquo;s providence of created things before their creation was
empty. Abelard explicitly raises and answers this problem. Cf.
<em>Five Texts</em> (Spade 1994), pp. 49-50 (135)-(140).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-33">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-33">33.</a>
 <em>Five Texts</em> (Spade 1994), p. 47 (123). Indeed, according to
the immediately following paragraph (124), the <em>status</em> has a
&ldquo;greater force&rdquo; in determining the community of universal
names; so it may even be <em>primarily</em> signified by a common
term.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-34">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-34">34.</a>
 In fact, this may be an early anticipation of the distinction that
appears in Aquinas, who distinguishes between that <em>from which</em>
a name is imposed, and that <em>on which</em> the name is imposed,
what is <em>intended</em> to be signified. For more on this
distinction, see Klima 1996a.</p>

 The addition of this paragraph was prompted by a post by &ldquo;the
maverick philosopher&rdquo;, William F. Vallicella:
 <a href="http://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2012/10/gyula-klima-on-common-natures.html" target="other"><em>Gyula Klima on common natures</em></a>.
 That post also refers to another one, questioning the force of
Aquinas&rsquo; argument concerning neither unity nor multiplicity
belonging to a nature according to its absolute consideration:
 <a href="http://maverickphilosopher.typepad.com/maverick_philosopher/2012/04/frege-meets-aquinas-a-passage-from-de-ente-et-essentia.html" target="other"><em>Frege meets Aquinas: A passage from De Ente etEssentia</em></a>.
 Interestingly, something similar to the Fregean distinction invoked
by Vallicella between a mark (Merkmal) of a concept and a property
(Eigenschaft) of a concept is quite explicitly made, although
obviously not in the same terms, by Cajetan in his discussion of the
argument in his commentary on Aquinas&rsquo; text (pp. 134-143, nn.
55-56.). A &ldquo;good Thomistic answer&rdquo; to Vallicella&rsquo;s
objection, the possibility of which he hints at in the latter post,
can be found in Cajetan&rsquo;s q. VI of his commentary (pp. 143-155,
nn. 57-62), which this paragraph was meant to reconstruct. For an
excellent, detailed discussion of Cajetan&rsquo;s solution, see Wood,
2011.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-40">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-40">40.</a> In Aquinas, <em>De ente et essentia</em>, c. 3 (in <em>Opera Omnia</em>), we find:</p>

<blockquote>
 Human nature has in the intellect existence abstracted from
all individuals, and thus it is related uniformly to all individuals
that exist outside the soul, as it is equally similar to all of them,
and it leads to knowledge of all insofar as they are men. Since the
nature in the intellect has this relation to each individual, the
intellect invents the notion of species and attributes it to itself.
Hence, the Commentator, in <em>De Anima</em> I, com. 8, says,
&lsquo;The intellect is what makes universality in things,&rsquo; and
Avicenna says the same in his <em>Metaphysicae</em> V, cap. 2.
Although this nature understood in the intellect has the notion of a
universal in relation to things outside the soul (because it is one
likeness of them all), as the nature has existence in this intellect
or in that one, it is a certain particular understood species.
</blockquote>

Cf. Suarez, F., <em>Disputaciones Metafisicas</em>, pp. 360-361. For a
somewhat different interpretation of the same distinction, however,
cf. also Cajetan, <em>Commentary on Being and Essence</em>, pp. 67-71,
121-124.</p>

 To be sure, this conception of indifference of representation based
on essential similarity of the represented things raises a number of
further questions which seriously challenge the success of
Ockham&rsquo;s semantic program on the level of how the fundamental
semantic relation between concepts and things is established. A
detailed discussion of this issue can be found in Klima 1997. Cf.
also, Adams 1987, I, c.3, pp. 121-133. A detailed analysis and
powerful defense of Ockham&rsquo;s conception is provided by Claude

 In medieval logic (regardless of many disagreements over the details
between individual authors), <em>personal supposition</em> (when a
term is used to refer in a proposition to something of which it can
truly be predicated with the mediation of the copula of the
proposition in question) was commonly distinguished from <em>simple
supposition</em> (when the term is used to refer to its <em>immediate
significate</em>), and <em>material supposition</em> (when the term is
used to refer to itself or other tokens of its type). For a brief
summary account of the medieval theories of the properties of terms,
see Spade 1982. For <em>much</em> more, see Spade 1996a. See also Read

 Again, this need not necessarily be regarded as a flaw of this
theory. After all, in our age of satellite uplinks and computer
networks we should not find the idea of <em>the same</em> information
content (which is nothing but the <em>objective concept</em> in the
scholastic jargon) being realized in several, physically radically
different media. (Indeed, <em>Napster</em> would not be in trouble, if
the recording companies did not think that the music downloaded is the
same that they had recorded.)</p>

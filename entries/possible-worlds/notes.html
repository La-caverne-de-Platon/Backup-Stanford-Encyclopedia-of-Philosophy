<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>
 A logic is often (quite legitimately) defined more generally to be a 
language together with <em>either</em> a semantic theory or some sort
of deductive apparatus, as in the definition found in the 
<i>Encyclopedia</i> entry  on 
 <a href="../logic-classical/index.html">classical logic</a>.
 However, as the distinction between extensional and intensional 
logics drawn here is a purely semantic one, it is convenient for our 
purposes to use the more limited, semantically-oriented definition. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>
 A word about the corner quotes, or &ldquo;quasi-quotes&rdquo;, around
the 2-element expressions &lsquo;&#9671;&phi;&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;&#9633;&phi;&rsquo; here. <b>Poss</b> and <b>Nec</b> are 
<em>metalinguistic</em> statements, statements of a language &mdash; 
in this case, English enhanced with a bit of logical apparatus 
&mdash; made <em>about</em> the statements in (typically) some other 
language &mdash; in this case, the statements of some (unspecified) 
modal language &#8466;. We need some type of quotation marks around 
&lsquo;&#9671;&phi;&rsquo; and &lsquo;&#9633;&phi;&rsquo; in 
<b>Poss</b> and <b>Nec</b> because &lsquo;&#9671;&rsquo; is not 
itself a part of our English metalanguage; rather, we are referring 
to certain statements of &#8466; that contain it, viz., those that 
begin with it. Ordinary single quotation marks will not do, as they 
create names for the very expressions they enclose and our intent 
here is to refer, not to the strings &lsquo;&#9633;&phi;&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;&#9671;&phi;&rsquo; themselves but, rather, in each case, to 
sentences of &#8466; that have the <em>forms</em> those expressions 
indicate. This is the purpose of the quasi-quotes. Thus, <b>Nec</b> 
can be read as follows: For any sentence &phi; of &#8466;, the 
sentence that results from prefixing the symbol &lsquo;&#9633;&rsquo;
to &phi; is true if and only if &phi; is true in every possible 
world. Similarly for <b>Poss</b>. (Readers familiar with the 
programming language Lisp will recognize the similarity between 
quasi-quotes and the Lisp backquote operator.) For more on this 
topic, see Washington 1998 as well as the entry 
 <a href="../quotation/index.html">Quotation</a>.
 </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>
 Tarski's own early work on the semantics of predicate logic was 
much more informal than the account here, which for the most part 
reflects the development found in modern expositions that came to 
full flower in, notably, Kemeny 1956a and 1956b. The account here 
differs from both Tarski's approach and its typical modern 
incarnations in that interpretations assign values to variables 
directly, much as if they were names. On the more typical approach, 
interpretations do not assign values to variables; rather, variables
can be assigned different values within one and the same interpretation.
(See 
 <a href="../logic-classical/index.html#4">&sect;4</a>
 of the entry on
 <a href="../logic-classical/index.html">classical logic</a> for details.)
 The chief advantage of the approach adopted here (which does not 
alter the critical notions of validity and logical consequence 
in any significant way) is that it enables one to define the notion 
of truth under an interpretation directly (and rather 
more simply). For Tarski's own approach, see 
 <a href="../tarski/index.html#Tru">&sect;2</a>
 of the entry on <a href="../tarski/index.html">Tarski</a>
 and 
 <a href="../tarski-truth/index.html#StaTruDef">&sect;2.1</a>
 of the entry on 
 <a href="../tarski-truth/index.html">Tarski's truth definitions</a>.
 See also the seminal work of Etchemendy (1990) for a more 
philosophical examination of Tarski's work. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>
 Bayart 1958 and 1959 are surprisingly unfamiliar to contemporary 
philosophers and logicians. In these papers, Bayart &mdash; working 
largely independently, it appears &mdash; developed a possible world 
semantics for first-order modal languages and proved the soundness 
and completeness of first-order S5. The articles are translated and 
given a very informative introduction by Cresswell (2015), 
whom the author thanks for introducing him to Bayart's work. See the 
entry 
 <a href="../logic-modal-origins/index.html">Modern Origins of Modal Logic</a>
 as well as Copeland 2002 and Goldblatt 2003 for a comprehensive 
overview of the historical development of possible world semantics in
the 20th century. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>
 We follow Kripke (1963) in taking names to be 
&ldquo;rigid&rdquo;, i.e., to have a fixed denotation that is 
independent of worlds. A more general (but, for purposes here, 
needlessly more complicated) approach, following Carnap 1947, is to 
assign intensions, not only to predicates, but to names as well. See,
e.g., ch. 13 of Garson 2006, esp. &sect;13.2, as well as 
 <a href="../logic-intensional/index-2.html#ParIntLog">&sect;3</a>
 of the entry  on 
 <a href="../logic-intensional/index.html">intensional logic</a>,
 especially &sect;&sect;3.3&ndash;3.5. See 
 <a href="../logic-intensional/index.html#ProRig">&sect;3.6</a>
 of the entry for a discussion of problems arising from the assumption
that names are rigid.  </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
 We again follow Kripke (1963) here and adopt a <em>variable domain</em> 
semantics for quantified modal logic to capture the intuition that, 
&ldquo;under different circumstances, fewer, more, or other things 
might have existed&rdquo;. A common alternative is simply to let the 
quantifiers range over the single <em>fixed</em> domain <b>D</b> of 
all &ldquo;possible objects&rdquo; and, instead, introduce a 
primitive existence predicate &lsquo;<i>E!</i>&rsquo; whose extension
varies from world to world. Aside from the fact that Kripke's 
treatment of the quantifiers arguably yields an intuitively more 
correct semantics of quantification in modal contexts, formally, 
unlike a fixed domain semantics, it prevents certain controversial 
modal principles &mdash; most notably, the so-called Barcan Formula 
<sup>&lceil;</sup>&#9671;&exist;&nu;&phi; &rarr; 
&exist;&nu;&#9671;&phi;<sup>&rceil;</sup> (Barcan 1946) &mdash; from 
being logical truths. See the articles on 
 <a href="../actualism/index.html">actualism</a>
 (especially 
 <a href="../actualism/index.html#SQML">&sect;2</a>
 and 
 <a href="../actualism/index.html#Kripke">&sect;3</a>)
 and 
 <a href="../logic-modal/index.html">modal logic</a>
 (especially
 <a href="../logic-modal/index.html#QuaModLog">&sect;13</a>)
 for detailed discussion.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a> Some possible world
 semantic theories (e.g., Menzel 1991 and (in its own way) Jager 1982)
 impose the additional condition that
 <b>I</b><sub>&pi;</sub>(<b>w</b>) contain only (<i>n</i>-tuples of)
 things that exist in <b>w</b>. This condition reflects the thesis of
 <em>serious actualism</em> that exemplification entails existence,
 i.e., that it is not possible to exemplify a property at a possible
 world without existing in that world. For more on serious actualism,
 see the entry <a href="../actualism/index.html">actualism</a>, especially,
 <a href="../actualism/index-2.html#CBFandSA">&sect;2.2.3</a> and
 <a href="../actualism/notes.html#6">note 6</a>.
 </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a> In a more comprehensive
 exposition of possible world semantics, the definition of a possible
 world interpretation would include a binary <em>accessibility</em>
 relation <b>R</b> on the set <b>W</b> of worlds and the modal clause
 would say that <sup>&lceil;</sup>&#9723;&psi;<sup>&rceil;</sup> is
 true at <b>w</b> if and only if &psi; is true at all worlds <b>u</b>
 that are <em>accessible from</em> <b>w</b> i.e., all worlds <b>u</b>
 such that <b>Rwu</b>. (See
 <a href="../logic-modal/index-2.html#ModAxiConFra">&sect;&sect;7&ndash;8</a>
 of the  entry on
 <a href="../logic-modal/index.html">modal logic</a>.)  Our semantics here
 is essentially the special case of this approach where all worlds
 accessible to each other. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a> For examples of the
 use of intensional entities in more sophisticated developments of
 possible world semantics, particularly with regard to the semantics
 of natural language, see, e.g., Lewis 1970, Montague 1974, Kaplan
 1979, and Cresswell 1973, 1985a/b, 1988, 1990, 1994, 1996 as well as
 the <i>Encyclopedia</i> entry on
 <a href="../logic-intensional/index.html">intensional logic</a>.
 </p>

<!--
<p> <a name="Sent"><a href="index.html#Sent">Sent.</a></a> Sentences
of course are usually represented in predicate logic with more
structure, but not all sentences are so representable, notably, simple
sentences with "indeterminate subjects" like &lsquo;It is
raining&rsquo;. 0-place predicates &mdash; i.e., in effect, sentence
letters &mdash; can be useful in such cases.  </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>
 The <i>de re</i>/<i>de dicto</i> distinction traces back to Aristotle
(see Nortmann 2002) and was a matter of robust discussion in the 
medieval period (see the <i>Encyclopedia</i> entry on
 <a href="../modality-medieval/index.html">medieval theories of modality</a>).
 </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a> More exactly, &phi;
 exhibits modality <em>de re</em> if there is a subformula of &phi; of
 the form <sup>&lceil;</sup>&#9723;&psi;<sup>&rceil;</sup> or
 <sup>&lceil;</sup>&#9671;&psi;<sup>&rceil;</sup> containing either an
 occurrence of a name or a free occurrence of a variable. Thus, for
 example, &lsquo;&#9671;&exist;<i>xFx</i> &rarr;
 &exist;<i>x</i>&#9671;<i>Fx</i>&rsquo; &mdash; an instance of the
 controversial
 <a href="../actualism/index-2.html#ContCons">Barcan Formula</a>
 &mdash; is <i>de re</i> because &lsquo;<i>x</i>&rsquo;
 occurs free in the subformula &lsquo;&#9671;<i>Fx</i>&rsquo;. This
 definition corresponds to Fine's notion of modality <i>de re</i> in
 the <em>strict</em> sense (1978, 143). Sentences are <i>de re </i> in
 the <em>loose</em> sense if they simply contain a free variable in a
 modal context. As he notes, the strict sense is appropriate if names
 are understood semantically (as they are in this exposition) to be
 <a href="../rigid-designators/index.html">rigid designators</a>.  (Fine defines
 strictness and looseness for modality <i>de dicto</i>, but it amounts
 to the same thing.) </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a> This is of course not
 to deny that there are robust alternatives to these three. Two
 notable recent examples are found in McDaniel 2006 and Yagisawa
 2010. Both develop detailed theories of worlds that bear important
 similarities to concretism but depart from it sharply on several
 counts, in particular in their answers to QW.
</p>

  <p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a> Note that
&lsquo;part&rsquo; here does not mean &lsquo;proper part&rsquo;, nor
does &ldquo;any two parts&rdquo; mean &ldquo;any two <em>distinct</em>
parts&rdquo;. Even if there are (as Lewis seemed to hold) simple
objects like spatiotemporal points that have no proper parts, they are
still parts of themselves. Moreover, such objects bear spatio-temporal
relations to themselves &mdash; <b>coexisting at some time</b>, for
example &mdash; and hence are connected by the given definition. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a> It is worth commenting
 on the fact that, the rubric &ldquo;concretism&rdquo;
 notwithstanding, the notion of concreteness is not actually part of
 the definition of a world. Lewis (1986, &sect;1.7) himself
 acknowledges that his worlds are concrete according to several ways
 of understanding the notion, but is skeptical about whether the
 abstract/concrete distinction could be clearly made. Concrete
 objects, for example, are often defined to be objects whose parts all
 bear spatiotemporal relations to other parts.  But there are
 conceptions of certain abstract objects (notably, sets of
 spatiotemporally located objects (Maddy 1980) and physical universals
 (Armstrong 1986b)) that arguably satisfy this description as
 well. Nonetheless, we are sticking with the &ldquo;concretism&rdquo;
 label for Lewis's view &mdash; albeit &ldquo;advisedly&rdquo;
 (Bricker 2008) &mdash; because it still has a good bit of traction in
 the philosophical literature (due in large measure to the influential
 van Inwagen 1986). </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a> Let <b>Rxy</b> mean
 that <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> are spatiotemporally related and suppose
 <b>w</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>w</b><sub>2</sub> overlap, i.e., that
 they share a common part <b>c</b>. Let <b>a</b> be a part of
 <b>w</b><sub>1</sub> and <b>b</b> a part of
 <b>w</b><sub>2</sub>. Then, as <b>w</b><sub>1</sub> and
 <b>w</b><sub>2</sub> are both connected, we have <b>Rca</b> and
 <b>Rcb</b>. Hence, on the reasonable assumption that <b>R</b> is
 Euclidean, <b>Rab</b>. Hence, by maximality, <b>b</b> is a part of
 <b>w</b><sub>1</sub>. A parallel argument shows that <b>a</b> must be
 a part of <b>w</b><sub>2</sub>. Hence, our two worlds have the same
 parts and, hence, by basic principles of mereology, they are
 identical. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>
 For this reason concretism is often referred to as <em>modal 
realism</em>. That rubric is avoided here for two reasons. First, it 
is arguably tendentious, insofar as it suggests that abstractionist 
(&sect;2.2 below) and (some) combinatorial (&sect;2.3 below) 
alternatives to concretism are somehow less than robust forms of 
realism about possible worlds. (Indeed, Lewis (1986, 136) labels such
views &ldquo;ersatz&rdquo; modal realism; see notes 
 <a href="#23">23</a>
 and 
 <a href="#34">34</a>
 for more on ersatzism.) Second, the rubric is arguably misleading. 
Some uses of &lsquo;realism&rsquo; are intended to indicate that the 
fundamental locutions in a relevant body of discourse are 
semantically primitive and, hence, cannot be reduced to more 
fundamental notions. Some forms of scientific realism, for example, 
hold that discourse about the theoretical entities of physics is not 
simply shorthand for discourse about, say, meter readings and 
patterns on cloud chamber photographs. As discussed in &sect;2.1.3, 
however, Lewis is a <em>reductionist</em> about modal discourse
&mdash; the modal operators, in particular, are not semantically 
primitive but, rather, are to be unpacked semantically in non-modal 
terms. See Plantinga 1987 for more on this point. </p>

  

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>
 In his well known 1968 paper, Lewis axiomatizes the three predicates 
below (and a fourth) that express the primitives of his translation 
scheme explicitly, and calls the result <em>counterpart theory</em>. 
Hazen (1979) raises several challenges to the theory against which 
Hunter and Seager (1981) mount a defense that is tightened up 
formally by Forbes (1982). Notable more recent critiques of 
counterpart theory are found in Merricks 2003, Cresswell 2004, Fara 
and Williamson 2005, and Fara 2009. </p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a> It should be noted
 that, in Lewis's mature theory of 1986, resemblance relations are
 very fluid and contextually-dependent, and such relations can
 actually vary even within the semantics of a single sentence. See,
 for example, Lewis's response (<i>ibid.</i>, 254&ndash;5) to the
 &ldquo;there but for the grace of God&rdquo; examples of Feldman
 (1971) and others. </p>

 <p>

   <a href="index-2.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a> These are of
   course <em>first-order</em> intensions. Lewis does in fact allow
   for higher-order intensions as well, e.g., properties of properties
   of individuals like <b>being a property possessed by every great
   general</b>. Egan (2004) argues, however, that Lewis cannot
   generalize the definitions here and define, e.g., a property to be
   any set but, instead, must take intensions generally to be
   functions from worlds to extensions, much like the original
   definition above. </p>

 <a href="index.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>
 Two other notes about these definitions. First, propositions could in
fact have been defined as sets of worlds in &sect;1.3. They were 
defined as functions there for the sake of uniformity &mdash; 
properties and relations have to be defined as functions on worlds if
individuals are allowed to exemplify different properties in 
different worlds. Second, because any set is a property, including 
sets of sets, Lewis's definition encompasses not only properties of 
individuals but higher-order properties as well. (This point of 
course generalizes to relations.) </p>

 DeRosset (2009a, 1003) argues that &ldquo;pushing down&rdquo; to the

be the product of macrophysical recombination still leaves 
possibilities at the micro-level that seem unaccounted for by

 <a href="index-2.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a>
 As noted already, Lewis (1973, 86) originally identified his concrete
worlds with &ldquo;ways things could have been&rdquo; and realized 
later that the identification was vacuous. Even earlier, however, 
Stalnaker (1976, 68) had called him out about the use of &lsquo;the 
way things are&rsquo; to indicate the concrete actual world: 
&ldquo;If possible worlds are ways things might have been, then the 
actual world ought to be <em>the way things are</em> rather than 
<em>I and all my surroundings</em>. <em>The way things are</em> is a 
property or a state of the world, not the world itself.&rdquo; </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a>
 See van Inwagen 1986 for an especially clear and illuminating 
comparison of the two approaches and Plantinga 1987 for his own 
rather more tendentious comparison. See Lewis 1986 (&sect;3.4) for an
extended critique of abstractionism. Lewis (no less tendentiously) 
refers to abstractionism as <em>magical ersatzism</em> &mdash; 
&ldquo;ersatzism&rdquo; because, in Lewis's view, concrete worlds 
constitute the most natural ontology for modality and abstractionists
seek to replace them with (inferior) abstract <em>substitutes</em>; 
&ldquo;magical&rdquo; because it is mysterious exactly how these 
abstract entities, as understood by the abstractionist, manage to 
<em>represent</em> possible worlds at all. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a>
 Indeed, Plantinga acknowledges that states of affairs might just 
<i>be</i> propositions, but finds it more natural to distinguish 
them. See Plantinga 1974, 45. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-29" name="29">29.</a>
 Note that the qualification that a world be a <i>possible</i> SOA is 
required, as every impossible SOA satisfies the definition of 
totality. For suppose <b>s</b> is impossible and let <b>t</b> be any 
SOA. Then it is not possible that <b>s</b> obtain and, hence, 
trivially, it is not possible both that <b>s</b> obtain and <b>t</b> 
fail to obtain. Hence, <b>s</b> includes <b>t</b> and, hence, 
trivially, <b>s</b> either includes or precludes <b>t</b>, i.e., 
<b>s</b> is total. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-30" name="30">30.</a>
 Merrill (1978) argues quite forcefully that the strict circularity of
such analyses does not preclude their being semantically 
enlightening. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-31" name="31">31.</a>
 Thus Plantinga (1987, 207): </p>

<blockquote>
  Clearly [Lewis] is partly right: there is much about the nature
  of propositions we don't pretheoretically know....But we do know
  <em>something</em> about the nature of propositions, prior to
  theory. Conceivably they could turn out to be idealized sentences
  or divine thoughts; but they couldn't turn out to be just
  <em>anything</em>&mdash;donkeys, or fleas, or tables, for example.  We
  know that no propositions are donkeys, and we know that none are
  fleas.
</blockquote>

<p>

The concretist would likely agree. But Plantinga (<i>ibid</i>., 208) 
continues: </p>

<blockquote>
  Even as we can see that a proposition can't be a donkey or a
  flea, so we can see that a proposition can't be the unit set of a
  flea, or any other set of fleas or donkeys,....or a set of
  concrete objects of any sort. The problem, fundamentally, is that
  sets, like donkeys, obviously lack the relevant intentional
  properties &mdash; the intentional properties propositions have.
</blockquote>

<p>

Here the concretist would balk. The reason it seems obvious that 
donkeys or, for that matter, individual concrete worlds, are not 
propositions, or any other type of intensional entity, is that it is 
difficult imagine a coherent, let alone natural, theory in which 
concrete individuals play the sorts of philosophical and logical 
roles that propositions are often invoked to play &mdash; exhibiting 
closure under boolean operations, for example. By contrast, sets of 
worlds (and perhaps more elaborately structured sets built up from 
individuals generally) are able to play those roles. As to the charge
that propositions so construed lack the relevant intentional 
properties, the concretist would likely argue that the charge is 
question-begging, insofar as (a) the properties in question are not 
available within the concretist framework and (b) are not obviously 
doing any genuine theoretical work. (Cf. the responses of Hazen 
(1979, 322ff) to similar arguments of Plantinga's against Lewis's 
analysis of <i>de re</i> modality.) </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a> Note, importantly,
 that actualism is <em>not</em> the thesis that there couldn't have
 been anything other than the things that are, in fact, actual. Most
 every actualist believes there could have been. For instance,
 assuming his lifelong chastity, the Pope (as of April 2013), Jorge
 Bergoglio, has no children. However, most actualists would agree that
 he could have had children, i.e., that there are possible worlds in
 which that is the case. What the actualist denies is that <em>there
 is</em> a definite (non-actual) <em>individual</em> <b>a</b> such
 that <b>a</b> could have been Bergoglio's child; that there is a
 possible world in which it is true that <b>a</b> is Bergoglio's
 child. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-33" name="33">33.</a>
 This is an important qualification, as there is a clear sense in 
which concretists are not possibilists at all. One way to formulate 
actualism is say that there is no more general kind of being than 
that enjoyed by actually existing things. On this formulation, 
concretists are actualists. For, according to the concretist, all 
individuals in non-actual possible worlds exist in precisely the same
way that individuals in the actual world do. They are simply not 
<em>here</em> (in the broadest possible sense). van Inwagen (2008, 
40&ndash;41) makes essentially this point. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-34" name="34">34.</a>
 For further details of the new actualist understanding of modal truth
conditions, see 
 <a href="../actualism/index-2.html#NewActualism">&sect;4.1.1</a>
 of the entry on
 <a href="../actualism/index.html">actualism</a>.
 </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-35" name="35">35.</a>
 In fact, new actualists generally tend to opt for fixed domain 
semantics for modal logic (as discussed briefly in 
 <a href="#6">note 6</a>
 above) and a modal language that contains a dedicated predicate 
&lsquo;<i>C!</i>&rsquo; to express the property of concreteness. 
Thus, the intuition that there could have been something that does 
not actually exist is understood as the claim that there are 
non-concrete things that could have been concrete: 
&exist;<i>x</i>(&not;<i>C!x</i> &and; &#9671;<i>C!x</i>). </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-36" name="36">36.</a>
 More exactly, a haecceity is a type of <em>individual essence</em>, 
i.e., a property <b>P</b> such that (i) <b>P</b> is possibly 
exemplified, (ii) necessarily, if an individual <b>s</b> exemplifies 
<b>P</b>, then <b>s</b> exemplifies <b>P</b> essentially and, 
moreover, (iii) necessarily, nothing other than <b>s</b> could 
exemplify <b>P</b>. (<b>s</b> exemplifies a property <b>P</b> 
<i>essentially</i> if it is not possible that <b>s</b> exist and fail
to exemplify <b>P</b>.) That haecceities are considered individual 
essences is enough for them to play the role Plantinga intends for 
them but, intuitively, haecceities can be thought of as <em>purely 
non-qualitative</em> individual essences. </p>

 A set &Gamma; of sentences in the language &#8466; of a logic is 
(semantically) <i>consistent</i> if it has a model, i.e., if there is
an interpretation of &#8466; under which every member of &Gamma; is 
true. &Gamma; is <i>maximally</i> consistent if it is consistent and 
no proper superset of &Gamma; is consistent. Consistency is also 
often defined proof theoretically &mdash; &Gamma; is (proof

version of linguistic ersatzism (see esp. &sect;41). See Roy 1995 and
Sider 2002 for particularly sophisticated developments of this

 The use of &ldquo;<em>the</em> complex fact&rdquo; here assumes that 
facts with the same conjuncts are identical; nothing terribly 
important hangs on this principle, but it is a natural one for the 
combinatorialist and, hence, it will be introduced explicitly below 
(proposition

 <a href="index-2.html#note-40" name="40">40.</a>
 See Armstrong (1978b, 69ff). Note that, on this definition, 
&ldquo;[s]tructural properties may or may not involve certain 
relations among the part of the particulars having the 
properties.&rdquo; Thus, on this definition, properties of, e.g., the
form <b>being exactly two Fs</b> appear to count as structural, even 
for simple universals F. Armstrong gives the example <b>being exactly
two electrons</b>, although of course he does not claim that <b>being
an electron</b> is a simple). However, in a later incarnation, 
Armstrong (1997, 32) suggests that, for a property <b>U</b> to count 
as structural, at least one of the universals constituting <b>U</b> 
must be a relation that at least two of the simpler parts of any 
instance of <b>U</b> bear to one another. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-41" name="41">41.</a>
 Armstrong developed this notion of constituency in response to 
serious objections from Lewis (1986a, &sect;2.3.1) in regard to the 
notion of a structural universal, understood 
&ldquo;pictorially&rdquo; as isomorphs of their instances in the 
manner laid out in &sect;2.3.1. Lewis's strongest objection suggests 
that the notion is ultimately inconsistent. Consider the structural 
universal <b>Water</b> in 
 <a href="index-2.html#Fig1">Figure 1</a>.
 As can be seen there, the <b>Water</b> involves the universal 
<b>hydrogen</b> two times over; likewise for the <i>bonded</i> 
relation <b>B</b>. Lewis then asks: </p>

<blockquote>
  But what can it mean for something to have a part [two] times over?
  What are there [two] of? There are not [two] of the universal
  <b>hydrogen</b>, or the universal <b>bonded</b>; there is only
  one. The pictorial conception...has many virtues, but consistency is
  not one of them.
</blockquote>

<p>

Armstrong (1997, 119&ndash;123) argues in response that the objection
presupposes that metaphysical complexity can only be mereological 
and, hence, that structural universals are simply sums of their 
constituent universals. To the contrary, as noted, structural 
universals enjoy a richer &ldquo;non-mereological mode of 
composition&rdquo;. Armstrong illustrates the idea chiefly by 
pointing to cases of distinct states of affairs with identical 
constituents. For example, there is obviously more to the state of 
affairs <b>a's loving b</b> than the sum of <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and 
the universal <b>loving</b>, lest it be identical to the state of 
affairs <b>b's loving a</b>. The states of affairs must therefore in 
general exhibit a richer sort of composition than the mere 
mereological composition of its constituents to explain this 
difference. As structural universals are simply abstractions from 
states of affairs, the argument presumably concludes, it is 
reasonable to appeal to this richer sort of composition to explain 
their structural complexity. The response is promising but, 
unfortunately, Armstrong does not develop the concept of 
non-mereological composition any further. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-42" name="42">42.</a>
 This sense of &lsquo;gunk&rsquo; originates in Lewis 1991, 19&ndash;21, 
133&ndash;136. For reasons discussed in 
 <a href="index-2.html#Supervenience">&sect;2.3.3</a>,
 structural facts cannot be <em>identified</em> with the sum or 
conjunction of the simple facts they are grounded in. Problems that 
arise when the assumption that the constituency relation is 
well-founded (and hence that structural facts cannot be infinitely 
decomposed) is lifted are discussed in the supplemental document 
 <a href="problems-combinatorialism.html">Further Problems with Combinatorialism</a>.
 </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-43" name="43">43.</a>
 That is, assuming <b>O</b> is the thin particular <i>o</i>'s only 
intrinsic property, the atom/fact <b>o</b> is a &ldquo;thick&ldquo; 
particular, i.e., the thin particular <i>o</i> &ldquo;considered 
along with all of its intrinsic...properties&rdquo; (<i>ibid</i>., 
434). </p>

  <p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-44" name="44">44.</a>
 The example illustrates the sort of thing Armstrong has in mind in 
suggesting that complex universals enjoy a &ldquo;non-mereological 
mode of composition&rdquo;. If the complexity of the structural 
universal <b>Water</b> were simple mereological complexity, there 
would only be just the one universal, hydrogen (<b>H</b>) and the one
bonding relation (<b>B</b>) and, hence, the structure of the 
universal <b>Water</b> could not be isomorphic to that of our 
molecule <b>M</b>, in which <b>H</b> and <b>B</b> are exemplified 
twice. The &ldquo;non-mereological&rdquo; composition of the 
structural universal, by contrast, permits there to be, as it were, 
two &ldquo;copies&rdquo; of both <b>H</b> and <b>B</b> in 
<b>Water</b> so as to reflect accurately the structure of <b>M</b>. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-45" name="45">45.</a>
 For Armstrong, supervenience has significant ontological heft: 
&ldquo;[w]hat supervenes is no addition of being&rdquo; (Armstrong 
1997, 12). That is, in particular, complex states of affairs &mdash; 
whether mere conjunctions of simple, atomic states of affairs or 
structural states of affairs like our water molecule <b>W</b> &mdash;
are nothing, ontologically, over and above the states of affairs on 
which they supervene (see also <i>TLP</i> 2.032; Armstrong 1989, 113;
Armstrong 1997, 44ff). Lewis (1992, 216) finds the claim difficult to
understand in terms of a standard notion of ontology and, hence, 
proposes that &ldquo;[Armstrong's] question is not: what is there? 
But rather: what does it take to provide truth-makers for all the 
truths. That way, it makes perfect sense to say that supervenient 
entities add nothing to our ontology. A supervenient entity is still 
an entity, but it is altogether superfluous as a truth-maker.&rdquo; </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-46" name="46">46.</a>
 This claim is a bit ambiguous. Non-structural states of affairs do 
not supervene on their atomic conjuncts individually, but jointly, a 
claim that, it appears, must be understood via plural quantification: for
any non-structural state of affairs <i>s</i>, there are some states 
of affairs such that (a) <i>s</i> supervenes on them and (b) 
something is one of them if and only if it is atomic and <i>s</i> 
includes it. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-47" name="47">47.</a>
 The astute reader will have noticed that we have avoided displaying 
the exact form of the state of affairs <b>W's being water</b>. The 
grammatical form suggests that it has the form 
[<b>Water</b>,<b>W</b>], but that would not be correct, in light of 
the fact noted in &sect;2.3.1 that the constituent object in states 
of affairs of this form are thin particulars, and <b>W</b> is, by 
assumption, thick. Armstrong himself is not terribly clear on this 
point but, extrapolating from Armstrong 1993 (433&ndash;434) and 1997 
(34&ndash;35) (which are not obviously consistent), the most plausible form
of <b>W's being water</b> is [<b>Water</b>,<i>w</i>], where <i>w</i> 
is the mereological sum 
<i>o</i>+<i>h</i><sub>1</sub>+<i>h</i><sub>2</sub> of the thin 
particulars underlying the oxygen and hydrogen molecules <b>o</b>, 
<b>h<sub>1</sub></b>, and <b>h<sub>2</sub></b>. In fact, the notion 
of exemplification in constituent ontologies like Armstrong's &mdash;
or, at least, like our simplified reconstruction here &mdash; is a 
rather tricky business. See, e.g., Moreland 2011 and Pickavance 2014. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-48" name="48">48.</a>
 It is natural to understand spoilers in primitive modal terms, e.g., 
<b>a</b> is a spoiler for <b>S</b> just in case it is not possible 
that both <b>a</b> and <b>S</b> exist. But there does not seem to be 
any reason the combinatorialist cannot simply deny the primitiveness 
of the modality here and assert instead that it is just a fact about 
recombination that <b>a</b> and <b>S</b> do not co-exist in any 
combinatorial possible world, that a world in which <b>a</b> exists 
is not one where <b>S</b> does and that this non-modal fact is the 
truthmaker for the modal proposition above. Thus, a world in which a 
third hydrogen atom bonds to our the oxygen atom <b>o</b> in Figure 1
is simply not a world in which <b>W</b> exists; it is not a world in 
which <b>o</b>, <b>h</b><sub>1</sub>, and <b>h</b><sub>2</sub>, even 
bonded as they are in <b>W</b>, jointly constitute an instance of 
<b>Water</b>. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-49" name="49">49.</a>
 Notably, &sect;&sect;1.11&ndash;1.12: &ldquo;The world is determined by the
facts, and by their being <em>all</em> the facts. For the totality of
facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the 
case.&rdquo; </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-50" name="50">50.</a>
 A bit more specifically, Armstrong (2004, 74) takes a totality state 
of affairs to be a higher-order atomic state of affairs of the form 
[<b>Tot</b>,<b>T</b>,<b>being a state of affairs</b>], where <b>T</b>
is a sum of states of affairs &mdash; intuitively, the state of 
affairs that the sum in question is a totality with regard to the 
property in question. Heil (2007) argues cogently that the perceived 
need for totality states of affairs is a confusion based upon a 
&ldquo;shady &lsquo;linguisticizing&rsquo; tendency to conflate 
features of descriptions and features of what is described&ldquo; 
(<i>ibid</i>., 233). Keller (2007; 2009, 125&ndash;126) argues, more 
ominously, that the idea of a totality state of affairs is 
paradoxical and, hence, that such states of affairs simply cannot 
exist. However, the argument involves the assumption that if there 
are totality states of affairs, then they, too, form a totality. But,
as Armstrong (2007) points out in a reply to Keller, it seems quite 
consistent to accept the existence of totality states of affairs and 
deny that they jointly constitute a further totality, much in the way
that ZF set theory denies that the sets jointly constitute a further 
set. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-51" name="51">51.</a>
 That said, Armstrong goes a bit soft on his commitment to modal 
reductionism in light of, especially, apparently irreducible modal 
properties of certain relations. See 1997, Ch. 9, esp. 147. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-52" name="52">52.</a>
 Armstrong (1989, 47) adds a further condition on possible worlds: 
they must not include any (simple) bare particulars, but the 
requirement stems more from Armstrong's more global metaphysical 
views and does not seem essential to combinatorialism <i>per se</i>. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-53" name="53">53.</a>
 Totality states of affairs and so-called law states of affairs, among
others, are &ldquo;higher-order&rdquo; for Armstrong, insofar as they
involve properties of, or relations among, properties. Law states of 
affairs in particular are causal relations between universals 
(Armstrong 1986, &sect;15.2). </p>

  <p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-54" name="54">54.</a>
 As Armstrong (1997, 169) notes, on the combinatorialist picture, 
animal bodies and other large, complex, highly structured physical 
objects can only be &ldquo;loosely&rdquo; identified with similar 
objects in other possible worlds (or, for that matter, at other times
(<i>ibid.</i>, 104&ndash;7)), as any difference in the internal 
structure of complex objects <b>o</b> and <b>o</b>&prime; entails 
that <b>o</b> &ne; <b>o</b>&prime;. Cf. the discussion of loose and 
strict identity (<i>ibid.</i>, 14&ndash;17). </p>
  

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-55" name="55">55.</a>
 Armstrong himself argues from more or less these premises to the 
conclusion that <i>O</i> must be identical to one of its proper parts
but it is not entirely clear how to reconstruct the argument. Lewis 
(1992, 212) questions the reductive adequacy of Armstrong's account 
of analytic necessities and impossibilities, as the claim of 
analyticity seems to rest on the <em>modal</em> assumption 
&ldquo;that a whole cannot share a universal with its part.&rdquo; 
But, Lewis asks, why not? &ldquo;If something has a mass of [two] 
kilograms by consisting of [two] one-kilogram parts, how does that 
prevent it from also having a mass of one kilogram?&rdquo; See also 
Eddon 2007 for a detailed and incisive critique of Armstrong's 
analysis of quantitative properties. </p>

  <p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-56" name="56">56.</a>
 Somewhat surprisingly, Armstrong himself does not seem to avail 
himself of explanations of exactly the sort given in the paragraph 
containing the reference to this footnote. He does, however, 
explicitly appeal to the notion of emergence. (Indeed, he defines the
notion of an emergent property as a non-structural 
&ldquo;anomoeomerous&rdquo; property, i.e., a non-structural property
such that some particular that has it has a part that does not have 
it; see Armstrong 1978b, 69&ndash;71, 171.) In his 1997 (152&ndash;3), he uses 
the notion of emergence with regard to the prospect of a 
<em>simple</em> property <b>Q</b> of a complex individual 
<b>a</b>+<b>b</b> that arises nomically from <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> 
having certain specific properties other than <b>Q</b> and standing 
in specific simple relations. (It is unclear exactly how such a 
<b>Q</b> is to be distinguished from a structural property whose 
constituents are those simple properties and relations, much like the
properties <b>B</b> and <b>H</b> of Figure 1.) And in 2004b (14&ndash;15) 
Armstrong again appeals to the notion with regard to complex 
relations that are, e.g., asymmetric, and, hence, give rise to such 
impossibilities as: If <b>R</b> is necessarily asymmetric, there can 
be no state of affairs that includes both 
[<b>R</b>,<b>a</b>,<b>b</b>] and [<b>R</b>,<b>b</b>,<b>a</b>]. 
(Recall that, due to the unrestricted nature of recombination, no 
simple relation can be intrinsically asymmetric.) For more on 
emergence, see the <i>Encyclopedia</i> entry on
 <a href="../properties-emergent/index.html">emergent properties</a>,
 especially 
 <a href="../properties-emergent/index.html#OntEme">&sect;3</a>.

 More complex real-world examples of incompatible states of affairs 
can be found in molecular biology. The misfolded prions responsible 
for the class of TSE diseases (Novakofski <i>et al.</i> 2005) 
constitute a particularly dramatic example of the impossibility of a 
given complex object simultaneously exemplifying structural 
properties that it can exemplify serially. Instances <b>p</b> of the 
normal prion protein, <b>PrP</b>, are routine on the surface of 
mammalian neurons and consist of a polypeptide sequence <i>s</i> 
folded into a certain structure. Thus, both the component amino acids
of <i>s</i> and the structural relations they bear to one another are
constitutive of that instance of the structural property <b>PrP</b>. 
If that structure is altered in a certain way, <i>s</i> ceases to be 
such a protein and transforms instead into a pathogenic <b>PrPSc</b> 
protein <b>p&prime;</b> with very different causal properties. (The 
&ldquo;Sc&rdquo; suffix here derives from the TSE disease scrapie 
that affects sheep and goats.) The conjunction [<b>p</b> &amp;
<b>p&prime;</b>] of the two component structural states of affairs, 
therefore, is impossible simply in virtue of the fact that the 
structure that defines either (and endows it with its particular 
causal properties) involves relations between the constituents of 
<i>s</i> that are not part of the structure that defines the other. </p>

<!--   <a href="index.html#note-0" name="0">0.</a> In the passage noted, -->

 As with <b>AW3</b>, Armstrong himself (1989, 61&ndash;5) adds a 
proscription against bare particulars. The continuation of 
 <a href="index-2.html#ArmQt">the quote above</a>
 in Armstrong 1989 (579) reflects the modifications of 
<b>AW3</b>&prime; that allow for contracted worlds: &ldquo;Such 
possible atomic states of affairs may then be combined in 
<em>all</em> ways to yield possible molecular states of affairs. If 
such a possible molecular situation is thought of as the totality of 
being, then it is a <em>possible world</em>.&rdquo; </p>

 This is of course the problem of <em>alien universals</em> and 
<em>alien particulars</em> (Lewis 1986), which is discussed in the 
context of concretism in the supplemental document 
 <a href="problems-concretism.html#Aliens">Further Problems with Concretism</a>.
 In a detailed discussion, Schneider (2001) argues that Armstrong 
(1997) plausibly meets the challenge of alien particulars but fails 
with regard to alien universals. </p>

 The problem with possible world fictionalism identified in Rosen 1993
in particular led to the revised account in Armstrong 1997. </p>

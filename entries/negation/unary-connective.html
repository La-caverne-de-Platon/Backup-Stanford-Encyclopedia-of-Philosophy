<h3><a id="NegRouSta">1. Negation as the Routley star</a></h3>

<p>

The so-called &ldquo;Routley star&rdquo;, a semantical device
introduced into non-classical logic by the Routleys (1972) (Valerie
Plumwood, formerly Routley, and Richard Sylvan, n&eacute;e Routley), is a
one-place function \((\cdot )^*\) from
information states into information states and may be used to
invalidate the unrestricted and the negated <em>ex contradictione</em>
principles. The idea is that a negated formula
 \(\neg A\) is true at a state
 \(w\) in a model \(\cal M\)
iff \(A\) is not true at
 \(w^*\): 
\({\cal M},w \models \neg A\) 
iff 
\({\cal M}, w^* \not \models
A\). If the premises of the <em>ex contradictione</em> principles,
 \(A \vdash B\) and \(A \vdash \neg
B\), are valid, then for every state
 \(w\) from \(\cal M\)'s set of states, 
 \({\cal M},w \models A\) implies both
 \({\cal M},w \models B\) and
 \({\cal M},w^* \not \models B\). However, this
obviously does not ensure in general that \({\cal M},w \models
A\) implies \({\cal M},w^* \not \models
C\) or \({\cal M},w \models C\) for an
arbitrary formula \(C\).</p>

<p>

Its flexibility notwithstanding, the star semantics has been
criticized for example by van Benthem (1979) and Copeland (1979) for
lack of intuitive meaning and for not giving rise to an
&ldquo;applied&rdquo; semantics. Smiley (1993,  17&ndash;18) remarks
that the Routley star &ldquo;is merely a device for preserving a
recursive treatment of the connectives&rdquo; and that it does not
provide an explanation of negation until it is itself supplemented by
an explanation. The relation between the Routley star semantics for
negation and the interpretation of negation in (in)compatibility
models has been investigated by Dunn (1993) and Restall
(1999). Restall uses the compatibility semantics to make sense of the
Routley star and assumes that the compatibility relation is symmetric,
serial (alias &ldquo;directed&rdquo;), and satisfies the following
&ldquo;convergence&rdquo; condition: </p>

\[\forall x (\exists y(xCy) \Rightarrow
\exists y \forall z(xCy \amp z \leq y))).\]

<p> 

Since \(C\) is serial, one may focus on
what Mares (2004, 78) calls the Star Postulate:
 \[\forall x \exists y(xCy \amp \forall z (xCz
\Rightarrow z \leq y )).\] If the Star Postulate is satisfied,
for every state \(w\) there exists a non-empty
set of maximal (with respect to \(\leq\)) states compatible with
 \(w\). Therefore, to every state
 \(w\) one may assign a unique state
 \(w^*\) from that set and put
 \({\cal M},w \models \neg A\) iff
 \({\cal M}, w^* \not \models A\).</p>

<p>It is thus possible to define the Routley star
 \(w^*\) of \(w\) as one of
the maximal states compatible with \(w\). As
Restall notes, symmetry of \(C\) guarantees
that for every state \(w\),
 \(w \leq w^{**}\). If in addition it is required
that \(w^{**} \leq w\), the Double Negation
Law and the De Morgan laws hold. Restall (1999, 63) concludes that
&ldquo;we have a reading of the Routley star which makes a great deal
of sense&rdquo;.</p>

<h3><a id="NegInc">2. Negation as inconsistency</a></h3>


<p>The idea of negation as inconsistency is to understand <em>it is
not the case that \(A\)</em> as <em>\(A\) implies absurdity</em> or, more
generally, as <em>\(A\) implies something unwanted</em>. The latter
gives Allen Hazen&rsquo;s notion of subminimal negation (Hazen 1992),
suggested by Lloyd Humberstone. This notion of negation as
inconsistency is reasonable if implication is taken to be primitive
and not itself defined in terms of negation and disjunction (or
negation and conjunction). In Gabbay 1988, the notion of negation of
inconsistency is introduced by requiring that the negation \(*A\) of \(A\)
is derivable from a set of premises \(\Delta\) iff there is an unwanted
formula \(U\) that is derivable from \(\Delta \cup \{A\}\). The non-empty
set of unwanted formulas has to be distinct from the set of all
formulas and it must not contain any theorems.</p>

<p>If a single unwanted formula \(U\) is
assumed and \(U\) is not supposed to be such
that any formula can be derived from it, the idea of negation as
inconsistency leads to minimal negation as fundamental. Both
contraposition and constructive contraposition are derivable if the
standard left and right sequent rules for constructive implication are
assumed:

\[\begin{array}{cc}
\begin{array}{c}
   \begin{array}{c}
       \\ 
       A \vdash B 
    \end{array}
    \;\;
    \begin{array}{c}
       B \vdash B \quad U \vdash U 
       \\\hline 
       B, (B\rightarrow U) \vdash U 
    \end{array}
    \\\hline
    \begin{array}{c}
       A, (B \rightarrow U) \vdash U\\\hline
       (B \rightarrow U) \vdash (A \rightarrow U)
    \end{array}
\end{array}
&amp;
\begin{array}{c}
    \begin{array}{c}
       \\  
       A \vdash (B \rightarrow U) 
    \end{array}
    \;\;
    \begin{array}{c}
       B \vdash B \quad U \vdash U 
       \\\hline
       B, (B \rightarrow U) \vdash U
    \end{array}\\\hline
    \begin{array}{c}
       B, A \vdash U 
       \\\hline
       B \vdash (A \rightarrow U)
    \end{array}
\end{array}
\end{array}\]</p>

<p>If there exists more than one unwanted formula, contraposition still
holds, but it is not guaranteed that the two branches in the
derivation on the right of constructive contraposition involve the
same unwanted formula \(U\).</p>

<p>Intuitionistic negation is a paradigm case of a negation as
inconsistency. The constant \(\bot\) may be
picked as the unwanted formula that is unwanted because any formula
whatsoever can be derived from it. In Dunn 1993 it has been shown that
the familiar Kripke semantics for intuitionistic logic and the
semantics in terms of compatibility frames with a reflexive and
symmetric compatibility relation coincide. In Wansing 2001 it is
observed that a unary connective \(*\) is a
negation as inconsistency for a language that contains
 \(*\) and \(\wedge\) (the latter being governed by standard single-conclusion sequent rules) and a
derivability relation \(\vdash\) such that for no formula \(A\),  
both \(\varnothing \vdash A\) and 
 \(\varnothing \vdash *A\), whenever
 \(*\) satisfies (i) what Humberstone (2011) calls
selective contraposition: \[\Delta , A \vdash B
\slashrel \Delta , *B \vdash *A\]</p>

<p>(ii) the Law of Non-Contradiction \(* (A \wedge
*A)\), and (iii) double negation introduction.</p>

<h3><a id="NegCon">3. Negation as contradictoriness</a></h3>


<p>It is often held that syntactically a contradictory pair of
formulas is a pair \(\{A , \neg A\}\)
consisting of a formula \(A\) and its negation
 \(\neg A\) (see the entry on
 <a href="../contradiction/index.html">contradiction</a>).
 However, one may also
reverse this perspective and try to characterize negation in terms of
contradictoriness. This could be a non-trivial task because according to Grimm (2005, 55), on a most conservative account there are &ldquo;some 240 senses of contradiction.&rdquo; Moreover, there is the methodological view, emphasized by Humberstone (2019), that it is preferable not to ask what makes \(\{A , \neg A\}\) a contradictory pair, but to ask what in general makes two formulas \(A\) and \(B\) contradictories, thereby purifying conditions of contradictoriness of any explicit reference to a unary (negation) connective. 
Two formulas \(A\) and \(B\) (or the propositions expressed by them) are then subcontraries with respect to a multiple-conclusion consequence relation, \(\Vdash\), if \(\varnothing \Vdash \{A, B\}\), and they are contraries if \( \{A, B\} \Vdash \varnothing \). Accordingly, unary connectives \(\sigma\)  and \(\kappa\) are subcontrary-forming, respectively contrary-forming with respect to \(\Vdash\)  if for any formula \(A\), we have \(\varnothing \Vdash \{A, \sigma (A) \}\), respectively  \( \{A, \kappa(A)\} \Vdash \varnothing \), and a unary connective is contradictory-forming if it is both subcontrary-forming and contrary-forming.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, one may ask whether there are different conceptions of contradictoriness depending on how conditions of subcontrariety and contrariety are expressed in the object language by means of a negation connective \(\neg\) and maybe additional vocabulary. </p>

<p>
According to Priest (1999, 103; 2006, Chapter 4),
theories of negation are, in the first place, theories about the relationship
of contradiction, and according to Aristotle
(<em>Cat.</em> 13b1&ndash;3), two statements are
contradictories if, necessarily, one is true and the other is false. In
Priest&rsquo;s opinion, the Aristotelian conception leads to the view that
the Law of the Excluded Middle (LEM) and the Law of Non-Contradiction are
provable: </p>

\[
\vdash (A \vee\neg A) \qquad \vdash \neg (A \wedge \neg A).
\]

<p>

According to another conception of contradictoriness,
 \(\{A , \neg A\}\) is a contradictory pair if, 
necessarily, if \(A\) is true, then
 \(\neg A\) is false and, moreover,
 \(A\) and \(\neg A\) cannot
both be false. These conditions may be captured by the following
inference principles: </p>

\[
A \vdash \neg \neg A \qquad \vdash \neg (\neg A \wedge \neg \neg A).
\]

<p>

The subsequent table (notation adjusted) is taken from Wansing 2006
and lists several pairs of conditions that may each be regarded as
syntactic characterizations of notions of contradictoriness. In the
table, <strong>CPL</strong> stands for classical
propositional logic, <strong>IPL</strong> for
intuitionistic propositional logic, and
<strong>MIN</strong> for Johansson&rsquo;s minimal
logic. Whereas the properties [1] correspond to the Aristotelian
conception of contradictoriness, the less familiar notion of
contradictoriness captured by [2] is an understanding of
contradictoriness according to which intuitionistic negation is
contradictory-forming, although it fails to satisfy the LEM.</p>

<p>Wansing (2006) also distinguishes different conceptions of contrariety in terms of derivability and <strong>non-derivability</strong> conditions. For a critical discussion of Priest's views on negation and Wansing (1999) see Humberstone 2019.</p>

<p> In Lenzen 1996 a certain non-derivability condition is suggested as a necessary
property of any &ldquo;real&rdquo; negation \(\neg\), namely that there exists a formula \(A\) with \(A \not \vdash \neg A\). This condition may be seen as a meta-level counterpart of a classically invalid principle characteristic of connexive logic, viz. <strong>Aristotle&rsquo;s Thesis</strong>
 \(\neg (A \rightarrow \neg A)\). A systematic study of negation in the context of multiple-conclusion consequence relations that takes into account non-derivability rules is Marcos 2005, where Lenzen's condition is supplemented by also requiring that there exists a formula \(A\) with \(\neg A \not \vdash A\).</p>

<h3><a id="NegFal">4. Negation as falsity</a></h3>


<p>Another idea often associated with the notion of negation as a
connective is that the negation \(\neg A\) of
a formula \(A\) expresses the falsity of
 \(A\). If the principle of bivalence, saying that a
proposition cannot be neither true nor false and, in addition, cannot
both be true and false, is assumed and \(\neg
A\) expresses the falsity of \(A\), then
\(\neg A\) is true iff
 \(A\) is
 false.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-s1" id="ref-s1">1</a>]</sup>
 If the principle of
bivalence is given up and truth and falsity are kept apart as two
independent notions, there still remain some basic principles negation
as falsity satisfies under quite natural assumptions. In the possible
worlds semantics of Nelson&rsquo;s constructive logics with strong negation,
the worlds are viewed as information states endowed with a reflexive
and transitive relation \(\leq\) understood as
a relation of possible expansion of states, and two semantical
relations between a state and a formula are discriminated, namely
<strong>support of truth</strong>,
 \(\models ^+\), and <strong>support of
falsity</strong>, \(\models ^-\). In
this setting, both the support of truth and the support of falsity of
atomic formulas \(p\) are persistent with
respect to \(\leq\): 
if \(w
\leq u\), then \({\cal M},w \models^+
p\) implies \({\cal M},u \models^+ p\)
and \({\cal M},w \models^- p\) implies
 \({\cal M},u \models^- p\).</p>

<p>

In accordance with the notion of negation as falsity, an
information state \(w\) in a model
 \(\cal M\) supports the truth of the strong negation
\(\osim A\) of \(A\)
iff \(w\) supports the falsity of
 \(A\): 
\({\cal M}, w\models ^+
\osim A\) iff \({\cal M}, w\models ^-
A\). Furthermore, it is determined that a state supports the
falsity of \(\osim A\) iff it supports the
truth of \(A\): 
\({\cal M},
w\models ^- \osim A\) iff \({\cal M}, w\models
^+ A\). Strong negation thus serves as a toggle between support
of truth and support of falsity. As a result, both double negation
introduction and double negation elimination are valid in the sense
that their truth is supported by every state of any model. Moreover,
if the usual falsification conditions for conjunctions and
disjunctions are assumed, every De Morgan law emerges as
valid. Contrary to what is the case with negation as impossibility
evaluated in compatibility models and negation as inconsistency,
strong negation as falsity does not, however, inevitably validate
contraposition.</p>

<p>Another interesting feature of strong negation is that provable
equivalence is not a congruence relation, i.e., the replacement rule
\[\mathord{\vdash A \leftrightarrow B} \slashrel
\mathord{\vdash C[p/A] \leftrightarrow C[p/B]}\] is not valid,
where \(C[p/A]\) is the result of uniformly
substituting \(A\) for some atomic formula
\(p\) in \(C\). The
replacement property, however, does hold for a stronger notion of
equivalence: 

\[

\mathord{\vdash A \Leftrightarrow B}
\slashrel \mathord{\vdash C[p/A] \Leftrightarrow C[p/B]},\]

where \(A \Leftrightarrow B\) is defined as
\((A \leftrightarrow B) \wedge (\osim A
\leftrightarrow \osim B)\). The latter replacement property also
reflects the treatment of truth and falsity as two primitive and
equally important notions. A comprehensive algebraic study of Nelson&rsquo;s
constructive logics with strong negation can be found in Odintsov
2008; substructural subsystems of Nelson&rsquo;s logics have been considered
in Wansing 
1993.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-s2" id="ref-s2">2</a>]</sup>
 Logics of falsification are also studied in
Wansing 2013, Kapsner 2014, K&uuml;rbis 2019.</p>

<h3><a id="NegCan">5. Negation as cancellation</a></h3>

<p>

The co-implication connective is also sometimes referred to as
&ldquo;subtraction&rdquo;, the idea being that \((A
\coimp B)\) may be understood as expressing the result of
subtracting the content of \(B\) from the
content of \(A\). The co-negation
 \((\top \coimp A)\) then subtracts the content of
\(A\) from the truth. One may wonder whether
such a subtraction amounts to the annihilation or cancellation of the
content of \(A\). Cancellation is an action type, and the idea of negation as
cancellation is sometimes traced back to Strawson, who explains
contradictions in agentive terms: </p>

<blockquote>

<p> 

Contradicting
oneself is like writing something down and then erasing it, or putting
a line through it. A contradiction cancels itself and leaves
nothing. (1952, 3) </p></blockquote>

<p> 

If the idea of cancellation in
acts of contradictions is applied to obtain an understanding of
sentential negation, the content of or proposition expressed by \(\osim
A\) is the result of erasing or cancelling the proposition
expressed by \(A\). The idea of negation as cancellation is described by Routley and Routley (1985, 205) as follows:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-s3" id="ref-s3">3</a>]</sup>
</p>

<blockquote>

<p> 

\(\osim A\) deletes, neutralizes, erases, cancels \(A\) (and similarly, since the relation is symmetrical, \(A\) erases \(\osim A\)), so that \(\osim A\) together with \(A\) leaves nothing, no content.  The conjunction of \(A\) and \(\osim A\) says nothing, so nothing more specific follows.  In particular, \(A \wedge \osim  A\) does not entail \(A\) and does not entail \(\osim A\).</p></blockquote>
<p> 

According to the Routleys, principles characteristic of connexive logic then emerge as plausible, such as the so-called <strong>Aristotle&rsquo;s theses</strong>,  
\(\osim (A \rightarrow \osim A)\) and \(\osim (\osim A \rightarrow A)\), cf. the entry on
 <a href="../logic-connexive/index.html">connexive logic</a>. 
  If entailment is understood as content inclusion, it might seem that \(A\) does not ential \(\osim A\), and that \(\osim A\) does not ential \(A\) because the content of \(A\) does not include the content of its own neutralizer, \(\osim A\), and the content of \(\osim A\) does not include the content of its own neutralizer, \(A\).
For the Routleys, negation as cancellation also renders the so-called <strong>Boethius&rsquo; theses</strong>,  
\((A
\rightarrow B) \rightarrow \osim (A \rightarrow \osim B)\) and 
\((A
\rightarrow \osim B) \rightarrow \osim (A \rightarrow B)\), plausible. 
 If \(A\) entails \(B\), and thus the content of \(B\) is contained in the content of \(A\), then \(A\) does not contain the content of the neutralizer of \(B\), and similarly for the second thesis of Boethius. 
</p>

<p>
Priest (1999) takes up the
idea of negation as cancellation and develops from it a simple formal system
 that sastifies some principles of connexive logic.  
The first thesis of Boethius is not valid in classical logic, but it
is true in a classical model if the antecedent \(A\)
is true in the model. Accordingly, Priest uses an evaluation clause for implication
in possible worlds models ensuring that \((A
\rightarrow B)\) is true only if \(A\)
is satisfiable (true at some possible world):
 \({\cal M}, w \models (A \rightarrow B)\) iff (i)
there is a world \(w'\) with
 \({\cal M}, w' \models A\), and (ii) for every world
\(u\), \({\cal M}, u \models
A\) implies \({\cal M}, u \models
B\). If, in addition, it is required that
 \(B\) fails to be true at some world, contraposition
is enforced (see Priest 1999 and the entry on
 <a href="../logic-connexive/index.html">connexive logic</a>).</p>

<p>
A critical discussion of negation as cancellation and especially its supposed relation to connexive logic can be found in Wansing and Skurt 2018.</p>

<h3><a id="NegIte">6. Negation by iteration</a></h3>

<p>
The conception of negation by iteration addresses the question whether
there could be a unary connective, &sect;, such that &sect;&sect;\(A\)
is interderivable with \(\neg A\) for the negation operation \(\neg\)
of some given logic conservatively extended by &sect;. Such a
connective &sect; is a demi-negation or a square root of negation for
\(\neg\). </p>

<p>
In Kamide 2017, for example, two variants, <strong>IP</strong> and <strong>CP</strong>,  of Nelson's paraconsistent logic <strong>N4</strong> and its classical variant using material instead of intuitionsic implication are defined. In <strong>IP</strong>, respectively <strong>CP</strong>, double negations behave as intuitionistic negation, respectively classical negation. The unary operations of these systems are demi-negations (if added to <strong>N4</strong>, respectively its classical variant), and one may wonder whether these demi-negations are negations at all. This question is discussed in Omori and Wansing 2018, where it is noted that Kamide's negations not only satisfy the minimal conditions from Marcos 2005 for a unary connective to be regarded as a negation, but also that the truth condition for them is exactly the one for 
negation in <strong>FDE</strong>. </p>

<p>

The systems <strong>IP</strong> and <strong>CP</strong> deviate from the more familar conterparts they are variants of only as far as the falsity conditions for demi-negated formulas are concerned. In the context of extensions of <strong>FDE</strong>, this modification is part of a general strategy for obtaining contra-classical logics, logics, in which not everything is provable that is provable in classical logic, cf. Humberstone 2000b.</p>


<h3><a id="PerNeg">7. Perfect negation</a></h3>

<p>It might be expected that a notion of &ldquo;perfect
negation&rdquo; is rather restrictive and precludes many contenders
from the status of a negation connective. The syntactical and the
semantical concepts of perfect negation developed by Arnon Avron
(1999, 2002) are, indeed, sophisticated notions that, taken together,
basically designate only classical negation as perfect. Avron
considers consequence relations between finite multisets of formulas
and single-conclusion consequence relations between multisets of
formulas and single 
 formulas.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-s4" id="ref-s4">4</a>]</sup>
 With respect to a
multiple-conclusion consequence relation, a unary connective
 \(\neg\) is called an internal negation iff it
shifts formulas from antecedent to succedent position and <em>vice
versa</em>:</p>

<p>\[ A, \Delta \vdash \Gamma \mbox{ iff } \Delta
\vdash \Gamma , \neg A; \quad \quad \neg A , \Delta \vdash \Gamma
\mbox{ iff } \Delta \vdash \Gamma , A.\]</p>


<p>If \(\vdash \) is a single-conclusion
consequence relation in a language containing
 \(\neg\), the connective
 \(\neg\) is said to be an <strong>internal
negation</strong> for \(\vdash\) and
\(\vdash\) is said to be
<strong>strongly symmetrical with respect to</strong>
\(\neg\) iff there exists a multiple-conclusion
consequence relation \(\vdash'\) for the same
language such that \(\neg\) is an internal
negation for \(\vdash '\) and
 \(\Delta \vdash A\) holds just in case
 \(\Delta \vdash ' A\) (Avron 1999, Definition 3). If
\(\vdash\) is strongly symmetrical with
respect to \(\neg\), then
 \(\neg\) satisfies double negation introduction,
double negation elimination, and contraposition. A unary connective
\(*\) is a perfect negation with respect to a
single-conclusion consequence relation
 \(\vdash\) from the syntactic point of view if the
relation \(\vdash\) is strongly symmetrical
with respect to \(*\). This property is
enjoyed by negation operations in quite a few logics, but not, for
example, in intuitionistic logic.</p>

<p>

In addition to a syntactic notion of perfectness, Avron also
introduces a number of semantical notions of normality, including a
notion of strong normality. Among the logics considered by Avron
(1999, 2002) only Boolean negation in classical logic turns out to be
perfect from both the syntactical and the semantical point of
view.</p>

<h2><a name="MenProCauRel">Mental Properties and Causal Relevance</a></h2>

<p>
As noted in
 <a href="index-2.html#EpiObj">&sect;6</a>,
 the epiphenomenalist worry arises from two points that are absolutely
basic to Anomalous Monism&mdash;first, that mental events are at the
same time physical events, and, second, that while mental predicates
cannot figure into strict causal laws, physical predicates must. Early
criticisms moved very quickly from these points to the claim that
mental properties were causally irrelevant relative to physical
properties. Though it eventually became clear that this particular
concern can get no traction within Davidson&rsquo;s framework, it is
instructive to follow out the line of argument. An early critic of
Anomalous Monism, Ted Honderich (Honderich 1982&mdash;for related
literature, see Campbell 2003), articulates the worry by arguing,
first, that not all properties of an event are causally relevant to
its effect. For instance, the color of a piece of fruit has no effect
on its measurement&mdash;when the fruit is placed on a scale, the
subsequent movement of the weight indicator is not influenced by the
fruit&rsquo;s color. According to Honderich, the color is therefore a
causally irrelevant property of the event (of placing the green fruit
on the scale), while the weight of the fruit is a causally relevant
property. Honderich then asks: what accounts for this distinction
between causally relevant and irrelevant properties? And he claims
that only properties that figure in strict laws&mdash;physical
properties&mdash;are candidates for causal relevance. There is no
strict lawlike relation between being green and the resulting
measurement, while, according to Honderich, there is such a relation
between the weight of the fruit and that measurement.</p>

<p>
Honderich thinks that this simple point generalizes and shows that,
within the framework of Anomalous Monism, mental properties are not
causally relevant because they are not lawlike. His argument can be
understood as follows: since Anomalous Monism insists that mental
events have physical properties that can be related, by strict law, to
the effects of those events, and also insists that such events&rsquo;
mental properties cannot be so related, it is only &lsquo;by
virtue&rsquo; of its physical (i.e., strict lawlike) properties that a
mental event causes what it does. Its mental properties, and thus its
being the particular kind of mental event that it is, play no role in
its causal powers. Thus, Honderich suggests that the cause-law
principle must be articulated slightly differently&mdash;as the
Principle of the Nomological Character <em>of Causally Relevant
Properties</em>. This nomological property principle rules out the
causal relevance of anomic mental properties.</p>

<p>
Honderich&rsquo;s argument is instructive for a more general
consideration of the wave of epiphenomenalist criticisms lobbed at
Anomalous Monism. First, Honderich&rsquo;s distinction between
causally relevant and irrelevant properties is completely insensitive
to the question of what is being explained or caused, which effect is
under consideration (Macdonalds 1995 and Gibbons 2006 usefully discuss
the importance of typing effects in addressing the epiphenomenalist
objections). Consider the fruit example. While the color of the fruit
has no causal relevance to its measurement, that is not the only
effect of the event of putting the fruit on the scale. The color
catches the eye of a customer, bleeds onto the scale and changes its
color, and causes a host of other effects that are not salient when
considering only the effect of the measurement. Salience is dependent
on explanatory interests, and if we shift those interests, what was an
irrelevant property with respect to one effect may be a relevant
property with respect to another (see
 <a href="index-2.html#IntRelDuaExpStr">&sect;6.2</a>).</p>
 

<p>
Second, Honderich arrives at the view that an event&rsquo;s physical
properties are the only causally relevant ones through reflecting on
Anomalous Monism&rsquo;s insistence on the cause-law principle in
light of the anomalism principle. If mental events must instantiate
physical properties&mdash;strict-law properties&mdash;and all causal
relations must be covered by strict causal laws, then an event&rsquo;s
having such properties is a necessary condition for standing in causal
relations. Davidson can agree with all of this. However, Honderich
concludes from this that it is only &lsquo;by virtue&rsquo; of its
physical properties that an event stands in causal relations. This
&lsquo;by virtue&rsquo; claim then allows Honderich to move directly
to the conclusion that only physical properties are causally relevant.
What <em>enables</em> (i.e., is necessary for) causation is thus held
to be <em>responsible</em> for causation (for a similar argument, see
Kim 1993a, 22). But this is disputable. Not all necessary conditions
of some phenomenon are <em>explanatory</em>
conditions&mdash;conditions &lsquo;responsible for&rsquo; that
phenomenon. For example, a person can talk only if she was
born&mdash;having been born is thus a necessary condition of her
talking. However, her ability to talk is not explained by her having
been born. It is not &lsquo;by virtue&rsquo; of being born that she
can talk, though the former is a necessary condition of the latter.
Davidson himself expresses skepticism about the intelligibility of his
critics&rsquo; use of the &lsquo;by virtue&rsquo; locution in
discussing Anomalous Monism (Davidson 1993, 6, 13) (see further
 <a href="index-2.html#MenProExpRel">&sect;6.1</a>, and for discussion of a related mistake concerning the bearing of physical determinism on freedom see 
 <a href="related-issues.html#AnomMoniKant">Related Issues: 3.1 Anomalous Monism and Kant&rsquo;s Theory of Freedom</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The point that causal explanation is interest-relative, and must be
sensitive to what one wishes to explain, is not novel. But it is a
point that often gets lost in epiphenomenalist criticisms of Anomalous
Monism. However, it is also a point that invites important questions
about the relations and differences between causation and explanation.
As we have seen, Davidson insists on a firm distinction between
causation, which is a metaphysical relation between particular events
independently of how they are described, and explanation, which
concerns events only as they are described in particular ways. Thus,
he is inclined to dismiss the epiphenomenalist concerns about
Anomalous Monism, and the locution of &lsquo;causally relevant and
irrelevant properties&rsquo; as based upon a confusion and certainly a
different metaphysical framework than that assumed by Anomalous
Monism. Events themselves&mdash;rather than any particular aspect or
property of them&mdash;cause other events. Our descriptions of these
events (what we speak of as their aspects or properties) explain why
effects described in certain ways occur. Mental descriptions explain
actions by rationalizing them&mdash;making them intelligible in light
of the agent&rsquo;s beliefs and purposes. The mental event that
explains an action by rationalizing it is a cause of that
action&mdash;otherwise, as discussed above
 (<a href="index-2.html#MenCau">&sect;2.2</a>),
 there would be no way of answering the question concerning which of
the many mental events that rationalize some action are the ones that
actually <em>explain</em> its occurrence (see further the supplement
on
 <a href="explanatory.html">Explanatory Epiphenomenalism</a>).
 That mental event is also a physical event (as is the action it
explains), according to Anomalous Monism, because it stands in causal
relations (the interaction principle), and thus (given the cause-law
and anomalism principles) must instantiate physical (strict-law)
properties. But properties themselves don&rsquo;t cause anything, only
instances of properties&mdash;and these are the events that bear or
instantiate them.</p>

<p>
Is this point really responsive to Honderich&rsquo;s concern? It is
instructive to observe how some proponents of Anomalous Monism
(Macdonalds1986) have attempted to defend Davidson from
epiphenomenalist concerns by exploiting the point in the following
way. Honderich has insisted that the only causally relevant properties
of events are strict-law properties. But properties don&rsquo;t cause
anything; only their instances do. And particular, causally
interacting mental events <em>are</em> instances of strict-law
properties, according to the monistic component of Anomalous Monism.
(Recalling the discussion of the &lsquo;because&rsquo; argument in
 <a href="index-2.html#MenCau">&sect;2.2</a>,
 since reasons causally explain actions, and due to mental anomalism,
actions must be physical, the claim that mental events cause physical
events is justified.) So Honderich&rsquo;s nomological property
principle must itself be amended to the Principle of the Nomological
Character of Causally Relevant <em>Instances</em> of Properties.
Mental properties are causally relevant, according to this principle,
because their instantiations are also instances of nomic properties,
and nomic properties are paradigm examples of causally relevant
properties.</p>

<p>
However, it can reasonably be wondered how this line of thinking is
responsive to the point that appears to be underlying
Honderich&rsquo;s nomological property principle. After all, the issue
under consideration has been whether mental properties are relevant to
explanation (recall the discussion of the color of the fruit). The
Macdonalds&rsquo; insistence that they are turns on the point that
only instances of properties cause anything. But instances are neither
relevant nor irrelevant. At best, they either have or lack causal
efficacy&ndash; they are or are not responsible for bringing about
some effect or other. The Macdonalds have perhaps established that
because physical events are paradigm examples of causally efficacious
events, then since, according the Anomalous Monism, mental events are
physical events, mental events inherit any causal efficacy had by
physical events. But that is quite different than establishing that
mental properties are explanatorily relevant&mdash;that an
event&rsquo;s being a <em>mental</em> kind of event matters to the
occurrence of any effects in the world. (The Macdonalds (1995) later
acknowledge this and develop an account of explanatory relevance; for
discussion, see the supplement on
 <a href="explanatory.html">Explanatory Epiphenomenalism</a>.)</p>

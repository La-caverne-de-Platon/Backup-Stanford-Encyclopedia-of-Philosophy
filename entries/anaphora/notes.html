<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Anaphora</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 For example, the beginning of the entry for &ldquo;anaphora&rdquo; in
the Supplement to the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (London:
Macmillan, 1996) reads </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The study of <em>anaphora</em> (from Greek, &ldquo;carry back&rdquo;)
is the study of the ways in which occurrences of certain expressions,
particularly pronouns, depend for their interpretations upon the
interpretations of occurrences of other expressions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And in <em>The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguistics</em> (Peter
Matthews, New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), the entry for
&ldquo;anaphora&rdquo; begins &ldquo;The relation between a pronoun
and another element, in the same or in an earlier sentence, that
supplies its referent&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Some people also treat presupposition as a kind of anaphora, giving a
uniform treatment to both phenomena. See the SEP entry on
 <a href="../presupposition/index.html">presupposition</a>.</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 One difference though is that the quantifiers of standard first order
logic are unrestricted, whereas natural language quantifiers like
&ldquo;every man&rdquo; are restricted (here by the nominal
&ldquo;man&rdquo;). Still, it is easy enough to introduce a first
order language with restricted quantifiers that bind variables. The
pronouns in sentences like
 <a href="index-2.html#ex2">(2)</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#ex12">(12)</a>
 function just like the bound variables of such a language.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Sometimes philosophers and linguists consider conjunctions of
sentences like those in
 <a href="index-2.html#ex7">(7)</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#ex8">(8)</a>
 rather than considering the two sentence discourses. For example,
Evans (1977) considers conjunctions such as &ldquo;Few MPs came to the
party but they had a marvelous time&rdquo;. The reasons for thinking
the pronouns in the second conjuncts of such conjunctions are not
bound variables or referring expressions are the same as the reasons
for thinking this about the pronouns in the second sentences of
 <a href="index-2.html#ex7">(7)</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#ex8">(8)</a>.
 Hence we shall talk only of discourses like (7) and (8). Also,
henceforth we shall take the intended anaphoric relations in the
examples to be obvious (as they are); and unless otherwise indicated
we are only considering the readings of the examples on which the
intended anaphoric relations obtain.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Evans argued that a bound variable treatment also gets the truth
conditions wrong for cases such as &ldquo;John owns some sheep and
Harry vaccinates them&rdquo; (as well as for the two sentence
discourse corresponding to this conjunction). Wilson (1984) argues,
correctly in our view, that Evans is mistaken about this. But that the
account of pronouns with quantifier antecedents in other sentences (or
conjunctions) as bound variables gets the truth conditions wrong for
some cases (e.g.,
 <a href="index-2.html#ex8">(8)</a>)
 is enough to reject it.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Of course, one could argue that different quantifiers have different
capacities for how far their scopes extend, and that this explains the
discrepancy between
 <a href="index-2.html#ex7">(7)</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#ex8">(8)</a>,
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#ex9">(9)</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#ex10">(10)</a>.
 So far as we know, no one has defended this view, and we think they
are right not to.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 We believe that considerations of this general sort were first raised
in Davies 1981: 172&ndash;173. They are also discussed in Wilson 1984
and Soames 1989.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 These patterns, along with many others, are, to our knowledge, first
observed by Lauri Karttunen (1976).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 So far as we know, such sentences were introduced into the
contemporary literature in Geach 1962. The term &ldquo;donkey
anaphora&rdquo; arose from the fact that Geach used the indefinite
&ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; in his examples, as we do above.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 The name is due to Kamp. Heim (1982) calls one formulation of her
view <em>file change semantics</em> and that term is sometimes used in
the literature for Heim&rsquo;s version of DRT.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 The various hedges above (scare quotes around &ldquo;logical
form&rdquo;), here (&ldquo;in effect can be represented as&rdquo;) and
below are due to the fact that Heim and Kamp implement the feature of
DRT being described in different ways. For example, in the present
case Heim (on one formulation) assigns logical forms to sentences and
in these logical forms indefinites always have novel indices. Pronouns
anaphoric on an indefinite share its index. Indices on indefinites and
indexed pronouns function as variables. By contrast, Kamp constructs
discourse representation structures for discourses, and truth is
defined over these. An indefinite introduces a new discourse referent
into the discourse representation structure for the discourse it is
in. And a pronoun anaphoric on the indefinite gets linked with the
discourse referent the indefinite introduced. But Heim&rsquo;s and
Kamp&rsquo;s methods are both ways of insuring that the truth of a
discourse like
 <a href="index-2.html#ex27">(27)</a>
 requires that some one thing satisfy both the predicative material in
the indefinite and the sentence containing it, and the predicative
material the anaphoric pronoun is combined with.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Actually, the claim that the truth of
 <a href="index-2.html#ex26">(26)</a>
 requires every donkey owning woman to beat <em>every</em> donkey she
owns is somewhat controversial. This is discussed in
 <a href="index-2.html#HowManyReadDoDonkSentHave">section 4 below</a>.
 The literature, to our knowledge, doesn&lsquo;t discuss the same
controversy about the truth conditions of conditional donkey anaphora
like
 <a href="index-2.html#ex25">(25)</a>,
 but to us it seems the same phenomena is present.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 We assume that &ldquo;every \(x,y (\Phi(x,y)) (\Psi(x,y))\)&rdquo;,
where &ldquo;\(\Phi(x,y)\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;\(\Psi(x,y)\)&rdquo; are
(possibly) complex predicates that may contain free occurrences of
&ldquo;<i>x</i>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>y</i>&rdquo;, is true just in
case every assignment to &ldquo;<i>x</i>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<i>y</i>&rdquo; that makes &ldquo;\(\Phi(x,y)\)&rdquo; true
also makes &ldquo;\(\Psi(x,y)\)&rdquo; true.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 The notion of unselective binding (for adverbs of quantification) was
first proposed by David Lewis (1975).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 For example, Montague (more or less) assigned each syntactic
constituent a model theoretic interpretation and the interpretation of
a syntactically complex expression was a function of the
interpretations of its parts. DRT, by contrast, doesn&rsquo;t even
assign interpretations to parts of sentences.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 Groenendijk and 

Stokhof write the clause as follows:  \[[[\exists x\Phi ]]= \{\langle
g,h\rangle \hspace{3pt}  | \hspace{3pt} \exists k: k[x]g \mathbin{\&amp;} \langle k,h\rangle \in
[[\Phi]]\},\] (where \(k[x]g\) is a sequence that differs from

 <i>g</i> at most on <i>x</i>).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 As Groenendijk and 

Stokhof write it: \[[[\Phi \mathbin{\&amp;} \Psi]]= \{\langle
g,h\rangle \hspace{3pt}|\hspace{3pt} \exists k: \langle g,k\rangle \in [[\Phi]]
\mathbin{\&amp;} \langle k,h\rangle \in [[\Psi]]\}\]</p>

</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 That we only look at pairs \(\langle h,h\rangle\) means that
conditionals are &ldquo;externally static&rdquo;, and so cannot affect
the interpretation of expressions outside of them, unlike
conjunctions. This explains the following contrast: &ldquo;A man came
in and he was happy. He was rich.&rdquo;; #&ldquo;If a man came in, he
was happy. He was rich.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 But not outside: it is externally static, which explains the
infelicity of the following: #&ldquo;Every woman who ones a donkey
beats it. It is in pain.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 See, for example, Chierchia (1995) and Kanazawa (1994a,b). See also
Groenendijk and Stokhof (1990), Muskens (1991), and Beaver (2001) for
dynamic semantics in a Montagovian framework. For dynamic semantics of
anaphora using the computer science concept of a continuation, see
Barker and Shan (2008), Barker and Shan (2014), and Charlow
(2014).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 Chierchia (1995) favors a dynamic approach, but allows that anaphoric
pronouns can function as definite descriptions as well (see pps.
110&ndash;122, and
 <a href="index-2.html#DescAppr">section 3.3 below</a>).
 He also suggests that Geach Discourses (see above) can be handled
assuming the anaphoric pronouns in them are functioning as definite
descriptions. So perhaps he would invoke this mechanism to get the
reading discussed above for the second sentence of
 <a href="index-2.html#ex18">(18)</a>.
 But this is to invoke another mechanism in addition to the one
invoked by dynamic approaches to explain the anaphora in (18) on the
reading in question. And that is the point we are making in the
text.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 In addition to dynamic semantic theories, some recent work uses
features of dynamic semantic theories, such as treating anaphoric
pronouns as variables, keeping track of discourse referents, and
having indefinite antecedents introduce discourse referents or
variables without incorporating the dynamics (i.e., context change)
into the semantics. See for example Cresswell (2002), Breheny (2004),
Roberts (2003, 2004), Dekker (2004, 2012), and Lewis (2012, 2021,
forthcoming).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 In particular, Davies (1981) holds that pronouns anaphoric on
singular indefinite noun phrases (&ldquo;Mary owns a dog.
It&hellip;&rdquo;) &ldquo;go proxy&rdquo; for definite descriptions
(1981: 166&ndash;176). He holds a broadly Russellian theory of
definite descriptions, and views them as quantificational (1981:
151&ndash;152). He suggests that in relative clause donkey sentences,
anaphoric pronouns &ldquo;go proxy&rdquo; for number neutral
descriptions (which Neale calls <em>numberless</em>), and so explains
why &ldquo;Every man who owns a donkey beats it.&rdquo; (allegedly)
requires every man who owns donkeys to beat all the donkeys he owns in
the same way Neale does (see 1990: 175). And finally, the options
Davies considers regarding how to understand the notion that anaphoric
pronouns &ldquo;go proxy for&rdquo; or &ldquo;are interpreted
as&rdquo; definite descriptions (1981: 174) appear to be precisely
those considered by Neale (1990: 184).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 Actually, Neale mentions another factor as well. Concerning the
sentence &ldquo;Every man who has a daughter thinks she is the most
beautiful girl in the world&rdquo; Neale writes: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;it is arguable that a singular [Russellian] interpretation of
the pronoun is preferred. A reasonable explanation is that immediate
linguistic context, and lexical and background knowledge, conspire to
defeat the numberless interpretation. (In the normal run of things,
there cannot be <em>two</em> most beautiful girls in the world.).
(1990: 238) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We suppress this factor affecting which reading an anaphoric pronoun
has. For in the examples we consider in which an anaphoric pronoun
lacks a numberless reading there are no factors such as the
impossibility of there being two most beautiful girls in the world
that would &ldquo;defeat&rdquo; the numberless reading.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 Note that nothing like the impossibility of there being two most
beautiful girls in the world is present in this case to defeat the
numberless reading. Sarah could beat more than one donkey and the
Camaro driver could use more than one eight track player. See previous
note.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 Yoon (1994,1996) and Krifka (1996b) propose similar theories to
Neale&rsquo;s in that they treat donkey pronouns as number-neutral
definites. Donkey pronouns on these theories are just plural definite
&lsquo;the Fs&rsquo; except that they do not presuppose that there is
more than one F. Unlike Neale, Yoon and Krifka treat donkey pronouns
as referring to mereological sums, and exploit the fact that there are
maximal and non-maximal readings of plural definites to yield the
strong and weak readings of donkey sentences. However, Kanazawa (2001)
argues that singular donkey pronouns cannot refer to mereological sums
because they behave differently from plural definites (for example,
they are incompatible with collective predication). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>
 A little more simplified, the basic logical form of the conditional
donkey sentence is [[always [if a man owns a donkey]] [he man] beats
[it donkey]]</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 Of course, DRT, dynamic semantics, CDQ, and these D-types approaches
give different accounts of what these factors are and how they
interact.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>
 See also Schwarz (2009, 2013) for a defense of an ambiguity theory of
definite descriptions along anaphoric/non-anaphoric lines.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>
 The CDQ account of discourse anaphora was originally motivated by a
felt analogy between the semantics of discourse anaphora and the
semantics of &ldquo;instantial terms&rdquo; that figure in
quantificational reasoning in natural languages and in derivations of
systems of natural deduction for first order predicate logic. An
example of an instantial term in natural language would be occurrences
of &ldquo;<em>n</em>&rdquo; when one supposes that <em>n</em> is an
arbitrary prime number and on the basis of subsequently establishing
the claim that <em>n</em> is <em>F</em>, one concludes that all prime
numbers are <em>F</em>. Or given that some prime number is <em>F</em>,
one might let <em>n</em> be &ldquo;a prime that is <em>F</em>&rdquo;
and go on to establish certain other claims &ldquo;about&rdquo;
<em>n</em>. In systems of natural deduction, instantial terms are the
singular terms that are introduced in applications of existential
instantiation and eliminated in applications of universal
generalization. CDQ has been applied to the instantial terms of a
certain range of systems of natural deduction (see King 1991). In
these applications, occurrences of formulas containing instantial
terms in derivations are assigned truth conditions. The truth
conditions assigned depend on the structure of the derivation
containing the occurrence of the formula. Thus given an occurrence of
a formula <em>A</em> in derivation <em>D</em>, one defines the truth
conditions of <em>A</em> in context <em>c</em>, where <em>c</em>
encodes the structural features of derivation <em>D</em> that are
relevant to the truth conditions of the occurrence of <em>A</em> in
<em>D</em>. The idea underlying the application of CDQ to instantial
terms is that such terms are quantifier-like expressions of
generality, where the precise nature of that generality (e.g.,
universal or existential force, etc.) is determined by features of the
natural language argument or derivation of a system of natural
deduction in which the instantial term occurs.</p>

 Kanazawa (1994b) discusses how the monotonicity properties of the
determiner on the wide scope quantifier in a relative clause donkey
sentence (&ldquo;Every&rdquo;, &ldquo;Most&rdquo; and &ldquo;No&rdquo;
in
 <a href="index-2.html#weakreading">(55)</a>/<a href="index-2.html#strongreading">(56)</a>
 a&ndash;c respectively) affect whether a universal or existential
reading for the sentence is favored. Though Kanazawa admits that other
factors also contribute to making one or the other reading favored in
particular cases (see 1994b: 124), he claims that certain monotonicity
properties of the determiners on the wide scope quantifier result in
only one reading being possible. Thus he claims that when the wide
scope quantifier has a determiner that is upward monotone on both
arguments (e.g., &ldquo;some&rdquo;), only the weak reading is
possible (1994b: 120, 124). We agree with this. However, Kanazawa also
claims that when the wide scope quantifier has a determiner that is
monotone down on both arguments (e.g., &ldquo;no&rdquo;) only the weak
reading is possible (1994b: 120, 124). Though such sentences favor
weak readings, sentences like
 <a href="index-2.html#ex56c">(56c)</a>
 cast doubt on the claim that they only allow weak readings. In any
case, the important point is that though Kanazawa is concerned with
how monotonicity properties of the determiners on the wide scope
quantifiers in relative clause donkey sentences affect which readings
are favored or available, he agrees that in the general case factors
other than such monotonicity properties affect which readings are
favored. See also Geurts (2002) for interesting data on factors
affecting which readings are favored for donkey sentences.</p>

 The following are some classic examples from the literature that give
different contexts to bring out the strong and weak readings of the
same sentence. Some people still find it difficult to hear the weak
readings of these cases, even with the context given. Chierchia (1995)
gives a context for a weak reading of sentences like (26:) </p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(26)</dt>
<dd>Every woman who owns a donkey beats it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(Chierchia&rsquo;s context is for the sentence &ldquo;Every farmer who
owns a donkey beats it.&rdquo;)</p>

<blockquote>
The farmers of Ithaca, N.Y., are stressed out. They fight constantly
with each other. Eventually, they decide to go to the local
psychotherapist. Her recommendation is that every farmer who has a
donkey should beat it, and channel his/her aggressiveness in a way
which, while still morally questionable, is arguably less dangerous
from a social point of view. The farmers of Ithaca follow this
recommendation and things indeed improve. (p.64)
</blockquote>

<p>
Gawron, Nerbonne &amp; Peters (1991: 15) argue that one can get a weak orstrong reading of:</p>

<blockquote>Anyone who catches a Medfly should bring it to me.</blockquote> 

<p>To get the weak reading, imagine a context in which thespeaker is a
biologist looking for samples on a field trip. For thestrong reading,
imagine a context in which the speaker is a healthdepartmental
official who is trying to eradicate the
Medfly.</p>

For example, Kanazawa (1994b) captures the strong and weak readingsby
defining a strong and a weak dynamic generalized quantifier foreach
determiner (see 1994b: 138). This appears to amount to claimingthat
determiners are ambiguous. However, Kanazawa appears to takehimself to
be simply &ldquo;modeling&rdquo; the readings of donkey sentences and
not actually proposing a semantics. Thus, in introducing his dynamic
predicate logic with generalized quantifiers, he consistently talks of
using the framework to &ldquo;model&rdquo; or &ldquo;represent
readings of&rdquo; donkey sentences (see 1994b: 132, 137, 138, 139);
and after discussing the framework, he writes: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
So far, we have not proposed any concrete model of the mechanism that
assigns interpretations to donkey sentences. Although it would not be
difficult to extract a compositional semantics from my treatment of
donkey sentences in dynamic predicate logic with generalized
quantifiers, our interest in this paper is not in finding the right
set of compositional semantic rules that give donkey sentences the
interpretation that they actually have (in the default case). (1994b:
150) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But the point is that if one were to turn Kanazawa&rsquo;s approach
into a semantics, it seems that it would posit an ambiguity in
determiners. Kanazawa himself seems to recognize this when, in
discussing Chierchia&rsquo;s approach and contrasting it with his own,
he writes &ldquo;So he [Chierchia] shifts the locus of ambiguity from
the determiner to the pronoun&rdquo; (1994b: 155). On the other hand,
as Kanazawa&rsquo;s remarks just suggested, Chierchia (1995) attempts
to capture the universal and existential readings by positing an
ambiguity in the pronouns in donkey sentences. As mentioned in
 <a href="index-2.html#DescAppr">section 3.3</a>,
 Chierchia holds that such pronouns are interpreted either as
dynamically bound variables or d-type (descriptive) pronouns (see
1995: 110&ndash;122). Chierchia denies that the (alleged) fact that
donkey pronouns can be interpreted in these two ways amounts to
postulating an ambiguity in these pronouns (see 1995: 117). However,
we don&rsquo;t find what he says on this matter persuasive.</p>

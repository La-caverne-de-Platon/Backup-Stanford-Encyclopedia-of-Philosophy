<h2>Supplementary Discussion</h2>

<h3 id="HerRolBir">1. Herder&rsquo;s Role in the Birth of Linguistics and Anthropology</h3>

<p>
Herder&mdash;especially in the <em>Ideas</em>&mdash;laid the
foundations for the modern discipline of linguistics, namely, with the
following five principles (the first three of which we have already
encountered):</p>

<ol>

<li>Thought is essentially dependent on and bounded by
language&mdash;i.e., one can only think if one has a language, and one
can only think what one can express linguistically.</li>

<li>Meanings or concepts consist (not in referents, Platonic forms, or
the subjective mental &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; favored by the British
Empiricists, but instead) in word-usages.</li>

<li>Humankind exhibits profound differences in modes of thought,
concepts, and language, especially between different historical
periods and cultures.</li>

<li>Because of principles (1) and (2), investigating the characters of
peoples&rsquo; languages and their differences from each other is a
primary and dependable means for discovering the character of, and the
differences between, their modes of thought and concepts. For
principles (1) and (2) entail that their languages constitute an
empirically accessible and reliable window onto the nature of their
modes of thought and concepts.</li>

<li>Whereas the early Herder of the <em>Treatise on the Origin</em>
(like the Enlightenment before him) had still implied that languages
were mere aggregates of particular words/concepts, in the
<em>Ideas</em> he came to emphasize that grammatical structure
[<em>Bau</em>] plays a fundamental role in languages. And whereas in
the earlier work his conception of grammar had vacillated between
supposing it inessential to language and supposing it universal, in
the <em>Ideas</em> he developed the consistent view that all languages
have a grammar but that they differ dramatically in their grammatical
structures: besides exhibiting <em>other</em> forms of rich variety,
&ldquo;in the structure [<em>Bau</em>] of language, in the relation,
the ordering, and the agreement of the parts with each other, it is
almost immeasurable&rdquo; (<strong>G6</strong>:353).</li>
</ol>

<p>
These principles formed the foundation for modern linguistics.
Friedrich Schlegel soon took them over and developed them further in
<em>On the Language and Wisdom of the Indians</em> (1808), applying
them in particular to the investigation of Sanskrit and other
Indo-European languages. Schlegel&rsquo;s work then quickly inspired a
whole wave of important further work based on the same general
principles during the 1810s and 1820s. This included the work of Franz
Bopp, August Wilhelm Schlegel, Jakob Grimm, and Wilhelm von
Humboldt.</p>

<p>
No less importantly, Herder&rsquo;s philosophy of language and
interpretation, together with a number of other philosophical
principles that he developed, also played a fundamental role in the
birth of modern cultural anthropology. Several of his writings,
especially the tenth Collection of the <em>Letters for the
Advancement</em>, indeed contain a virtual blueprint for that future
discipline. His specific contributions here were many and deep. They
included: (1) a conception that the central focus of the discipline
should be the psychology of peoples; (2) the principle of radical
mental difference; (3) a conception that the main task of the
discipline is therefore understanding rather than explaining; (4) a
hermeneutics based on the recognition of radical mental diversity; (5)
an insistence on methodological empiricism in interpretation; (6) an
insistence, in the spirit of his philosophy of language, on the
fundamental role of language in culture; (7) an insistence on holism
in interpretation; (8) a recommendation of participant-observation;
(9) a certain new and distinctive concept of culture; (10) an
insistence on the variability, relative appropriateness, and
incommensurability of values; (11) a pluralist cosmopolitanism; and
(12) an insistence that understanding other cultures also contributes
to better <em>self</em>-understanding.</p>

<p>
These principles came to constitute the very core of the new
discipline of cultural anthropology. The channels through which they
influenced its birth centrally included Wilhelm von Humboldt, the
"V&ouml;lkerpsychologie" of Moritz Lazarus and Hymann Steinthal, Franz
Boas, who was the founder of American anthropology, and Bronislaw
Malinowski, who was the founder of British fieldwork anthropology (in
that chronological order).</p>

<h3 id="HerMorRel">2. Herder&rsquo;s Moral Relativism</h3>

<p>
Concerning the relation of Herder&rsquo;s relativism to other parts of
his philosophy, he himself often backs away from it. As Frederick
Beiser has pointed out, even within <em>This Too a Philosophy of
History</em> he seems to try to combine it with an assumption of a
higher moral standpoint that does in the end permit a sort of
comparative ranking of moralities, namely, by invoking an analogy
between the historical series of cultures and the different ages of
man. Then in the <em>Ideas</em> he backs away from it in another way,
now asserting that there is a fundamental moral value that is shared
by all historical periods and cultures after all, one that can be used
as a common measure to assess the overall morality of one period or
culture as better or worse than that of another, namely,
<em>humanity</em> [<em>Humanit&auml;t</em>].</p>

<p>
These attempts to back away from relativism do not pose an
<em>intrinsic</em> problem for it, however, since they are themselves
both very problematic. The appeal to an analogy with the different
ages of man seems <em>either</em> to be a case of explaining
<em>obscurum per obscurius</em>, more specifically, a case of
explaining one apparent self-contradiction by another, <em>or</em> to
depend on overlooking the fact that when we make such seemingly
self-contradictory assessments about the different ages of man their
self-contradictoriness turns out to be merely apparent precisely
because when we posit an equality of value between the aspirations of
different ages we are thinking of <em>non-</em>moral aspirations but
when we posit progress in them we are thinking of <em>moral</em> ones.
Moreover, the appeal to a universally shared moral value of
<em>humanity</em> in the end merely looks like a desperate relapse
into the sort of empirically false moral universalism that many of
Herder&rsquo;s Enlightenment predecessors (e.g., Hume and Voltaire)
had espoused, but which Herder in his more insightful, relativistic
moments had unmasked as an error. (Nietzsche later implied a criticism
of Herder of just this sort in <em>Homer&rsquo;s Contest</em>, where
he argued that so far from championing humanity, as Herder had
claimed, Homer and his culture rather championed cruelty, strife, and
agonality.)</p>

<p>
However, Herder&rsquo;s relativism <em>is</em> in fact intrinsically
problematic, nonetheless. The main problem with it is that it is
psychologically impossible to refrain consistently from passing the
sorts of comparative evaluative judgments on other moralities that it
proscribes, and moreover harmful to try to do so. As Nietzsche
memorably put it, &ldquo;Is life not passing judgment, preferring,
being unfair &hellip;?&rdquo; (<em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>: section
9) If one is confronted with hard cases, such as the traditional
Indian moral code of <em>sutti</em> (the forcible burning alive of the
widow of a dead man) or the moral codes of certain tribes that
prisoners of war should be cruelly tortured and/or eaten, is one
<em>really</em> going to be able to sustain the relativistic
assessment, &ldquo;Just a different moral code, can&rsquo;t say that
it&rsquo;s better or worse than our own&rdquo;? And even if one could,
would that be a good thing? The answers to both of these questions
seem to be No. Indeed, as has sometimes been pointed out, Herder
himself, even in his most relativistic works, and especially in his
less relativistic ones such as the <em>Ideas</em>, does not
consistently refrain from passing negative judgments on other moral
codes.</p>

<p>
Still, there is a great danger of throwing out the baby with the
bathwater here. For even if Herder&rsquo;s relativism cannot be
sustained in an unmodified form for the sorts of reasons just
mentioned, it may nonetheless be a big step in the right direction,
requiring only modest &ldquo;tweaking&rdquo; in order to make it
tenable. And that, I suggest, is the case. The specific
&ldquo;tweak&rdquo; needed is to grant to Herder&rsquo;s relativism
that there are no universal or objective moral values, and that moral
values normally in some sense &ldquo;suit&rdquo; their contexts, but
to continue upholding one&rsquo;s own moral values and judging
others&rsquo; moral values in light of them, only now doing so in a
consciously non-universal, non-objective way. (As Nietzsche put it,
&ldquo;My judgment is <em>my</em> judgment&rdquo; (<em>Beyond Good and
Evil</em>: section 43), or, if one finds Nietzsche&rsquo;s extreme
individualism there problematic, &ldquo;Our judgment is <em>our</em>
judgment&rdquo;, for some less-than-universal <em>us</em>.) Such a
position does justice to the theoretical insights behind
Herder&rsquo;s relativism but without incurring its unacceptable
costs.</p>

<p>
Moreover, it still promises to support the sort of <em>toleration</em>
that Herder clearly saw as an important benefit of his relativism,
albeit now in a slightly different way: not by outlawing comparative
evaluations of moralities altogether, but instead by preserving an
awareness that in cases where our morality conflicts with another
morality both of them are usually based on non-universal moral
sentiments that in some sense suit their contexts, so that unless the
conflict between them is a really severe one an attitude of respect
and forbearance is appropriate.</p>

<p>
Nor (to anticipate an objection that cognitivists will be itching to
make here) does such a position threaten to undermine the
<em>seriousness</em> of our moral commitments. To use an analogy that
seems helpful here: when I love, and if push comes to shove prefer, my
own child over other people&rsquo;s children, this sort of commitment
to him/her need not be undermined in its seriousness by a concession
on my part (one that is virtually required by sanity in this case)
that other parents have similar preferences for their children as
well, that my child is not objectively better than all other children,
and that, like my own, other parents&rsquo; preferences for their
children serve important functions.</p>

<h3 id="HerLatPhiHis">3. Herder&rsquo;s Later Philosophy of History</h3>

<p>
His later writings by no means <em>officially</em> stay loyal to the
view that history has no discernible meaning; famously, <em>This Too a
Philosophy of History</em> insists that history does have an overall
purpose, and that this fact (though not the <em>nature</em> of the
purpose) is discernible from the cumulative way in which cultures have
built upon one another historically, and the <em>Ideas</em> then goes
on to tell a long story to the effect that history&rsquo;s purpose
consists in its steady realization of &ldquo;reason&rdquo; and
&ldquo;humanity&rdquo;. However, Herder clearly still harbors grave
doubts just below the surface. This is visible in <em>This Too a
Philosophy of History</em> from the work&rsquo;s ironically
self-deprecating title; Pyrrhonian-spirited motto; vacillation between
several incompatible models of history&rsquo;s direction
(progressive?, progressive and cyclical?, merely cyclical?, even
regressive?); and morbid dwelling on, and unpersuasive attempts to
rebut, the &ldquo;skeptical&rdquo; view of history as meaningless
&ldquo;Penelope-work&rdquo;. (A few years later in his <em>Theological
Letters</em> of 1780&ndash;1 Herder would write that history is
&ldquo;a textbook of the nullity of all human things&rdquo;
[<strong>G9/1</strong>:438].) It is also visible in the <em>Ideas</em>
from the fact that Herder&rsquo;s official account there of the
purposiveness of history gets contradicted by other passages that
insist on the <em>inappropriateness</em> of teleological (as
contrasted with efficient causal) explanations in history.
Herder&rsquo;s official position certainly had a powerful influence on
some successors (especially Hegel), but it is this quieter
counterstrand of skepticism that represents his better philosophical
judgment.</p>

<p>
Concerning efficient causal insights, Herder&rsquo;s later works again
in a sense stay faithful to his skeptical position in the <em>Older
Critical Forestlet</em>&mdash;but they also modify it, and this time
for the better philosophically speaking. The mature Herder does not,
like the Herder of that early work, rest his case on a
<em>general</em> skepticism about the role or the discernibility of
efficient causation in history. On the contrary, he insists that
history <em>is</em> governed by efficient causation and that we should
try to discover as far as possible the specific ways in which it is
so. But he remains highly skeptical about the <em>extent</em> to which
such an undertaking can be successful, and hence about how far it can
take us toward real explanations of the past, and toward predicting or
controlling the future. His main reason for this skepticism is that
major historical deeds and events are not the products of some one or
few readily identifiable causal factors (as political and military
historians tend to assume), but rather of chance confluences of huge
numbers of different causal factors, many of which, moreover, are
individually unknown and unknowable by the historian&mdash;for
example, because in themselves too trivial to have been recorded, or,
in the case of psychological factors, because the historical agent
failed to make them public, deliberately misrepresented them, or was
himself unaware of them due to their submersion in the unconscious
depths of his mind.</p>

<h3 id="HerSke">4. Herder on Skepticism</h3>

<p>
Herder tends to run together <em>two</em> problems in this connection:
(1) the problem of whether there is any <em>meaning</em> to the
seemingly anarchic and endless series of variations from age to age
(or culture to culture); (2) the problem that the multiplication of
conflicting views on virtually all subjects that is found in history
(or in intercultural comparison) causes, or at least exacerbates, the
ancient skeptic&rsquo;s difficulty of unresolvable disputes forcing
one to suspend belief.</p>

<p>
Problem (1) has already been discussed. Here it is problem (2) that
concerns us. This is a problem that Ernst Troeltsch would make much of
in the twentieth century. But Herder had already clearly seen it.</p>

<p>
Herder is determined to avoid this sort of skepticism. He has two main
strategies for doing so, but they are inconsistent with each other,
and neither of them seems promising. His first strategy is to try to
defuse the problem at source by arguing that, on closer inspection,
there is much more common ground between different periods and
cultures than it allows. This strategy is already found in the
<em>Critical Forests</em>, where (as was mentioned earlier) Herder
argues that different standards of beauty have an underlying
uniformity, and it plays a central role in the <em>Ideas</em>, where
in particular &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; is presented as a shared ethical
value. Herder&rsquo;s second strategy is instead to acknowledge the
problem in an unmitigated form and to respond with relativism:
especially in <em>This Too a Philosophy of History</em> he argues
that&mdash;at least where questions of moral, aesthetic, and
prudential value are concerned&mdash;the different positions held by
different periods and cultures are equally valid, namely, for the
periods and cultures to which they belong, and that there can be no
justification for a preferential ranking between them. The later
<em>Letters for the Advancement</em> vacillates between these two
strategies.</p>

<p>
Neither of these strategies is satisfactory in the end. The first,
that of asserting deep commonalities, is hopeless (notwithstanding its
seemingly eternal appeal to empirically underinformed Anglophone
philosophers). It flies in the face of the empirical evidence.
Moreover, it flies in the face of Herder&rsquo;s own better
interpretive judgments about the empirical evidence&mdash;for example,
his observation in <em>On the Change of Taste</em> and elsewhere that
basic values have not only changed over the course of history but in
some cases actually become inverted.</p>

<p>
Herder&rsquo;s alternative, relativist, strategy is more interesting,
but is not in the end satisfactory either (even concerning values,
where its prospects look best). Perhaps the most serious problem with
it is a twofold one that Nietzsche saw: First, as has already been
discussed in a previous supplement, it is psychologically impossible
to sustain, and moreover sustaining it would be harmful. Second, nor
does the phenomenon of fundamental value variations <em>require</em>
us to adopt such an indifference. For, while it may indeed show that
there are no universal or objective values, it leaves us with a better
alternative to indifference: continuing to hold our values and to
judge others&rsquo; values in light of them <em>only now in a
self-consciously non-universal, non-objective way</em>
(Nietzsche&rsquo;s &ldquo;My judgment is <em>my</em> judgment&rdquo;,
or its less individualistic variant: &ldquo;Our judgment is
<em>our</em> judgment&rdquo;, for some less-than-universal
<em>us</em>).</p>

<h3 id="HerHumRig">5. Herder and Human Rights</h3>

<p>
The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were a great age for the
concepts of &ldquo;rights&rdquo; in general and &ldquo;human
rights&rdquo; (in the form of the rights of &ldquo;all men&rdquo;,
&ldquo;les droits de l&rsquo;homme&rdquo;) in particular. Think, for
example, of the English <em>Bills of Rights</em> (1689); the American
<em>Declaration of Independence</em> (1776), <em>Constitution</em>
(1787/9), and <em>Bill of Rights</em> (1791); and the French
<em>D&eacute;claration des droits de l&rsquo;homme et du citoyen</em>
(1789).</p>

<p>
Herder, as a highly educated man of his time and a sympathizer with
the American and French Revolutions, was certainly very familiar with
the concept of human rights, or in his German
&ldquo;<em>Menschenrechte</em>&rdquo;. However, his attitude toward it
is ambivalent.</p>

<p>
Thus if one reads the two works of his that are most relevant for this
topic both thematically and chronologically, namely, the
<em>Ideas</em> (1784&ndash;91) and the <em>Letters for the
Advancement</em> (1793&ndash;7), the situation seems to be roughly as
follows. On the one hand, he has enormous sympathy with the American
and French Revolutions; embraces &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; as his highest
ethical and political ideal; accordingly, writes at length and with
great passion against despotism, imperialism, war, and every other
form of abuse, oppression, or exploitation of one human being by
another; and in the unfinished <em>Ideas</em>, where he lambasts the
Catholic church for its history of violating such values, planned to
conclude with an account of how, by contrast, the Protestant
Reformation had prepared the way for the English <em>Bill of
Rights</em>. But on the other hand, he conspicuously avoids using the
already available terminology and concept of &ldquo;human
rights&rdquo; in order to articulate these positions. There thus seems
to be a tension in Herder between, on the one hand, passionate
commitment to the substantive normative goals of the concept of
&ldquo;human rights&rdquo; and, on the other hand, some sort of
skepticism concerning the concept itself.</p>

<p>
This ambivalence is interesting, not only for historical-exegetical
reasons but also because we arguably ought to share it with Herder.
What are Herder&rsquo;s reasons, or at least (since he does not say
very much explicitly on the subject) possible reasons, behind his
skepticism about the concept?</p>

<p>
A central set of worries that he evidently entertains about the
concept of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; concerns an essential connection
between this concept and the concept of <em>law</em>. The eighteenth
century standardly conceived human rights as belonging to a system of
either <em>God&rsquo;s</em> law or <em>natural</em> law, the latter in
the sense of a set of universal norms either ordained by God or in
some other way inscribed in the very order of nature. For example, the
authors of the American <em>Declaration of Independence</em> used both
of these characterizations, while the authors of the French
<em>D&eacute;claration des droits de l&rsquo;homme et du citoyen</em>
left out God and appealed to natural law alone. In addition, the
concept of human rights emerged during the late seventeenth century
and the eighteenth century within a context of <em>positive</em>
law&mdash;specifically, within the context of framing new
constitutional law. The English <em>Bill of Rights</em>, the American
<em>Declaration of Independence</em>, the American
<em>Constitution</em> with its appended <em>Bill of Rights</em>, and
the French <em>D&eacute;claration des droits de l&rsquo;homme et du
citoyen</em> all exhibit this feature.</p>

<p>
The essential connection between the concept of human rights and the
concept of law must have been especially clear to Herder, not only
because of the history just outlined, but also because in German the
word for a right, <em>Recht</em>, often simply <em>means</em>
&ldquo;law&rdquo;, just as in French the word for a right,
<em>droit</em>, often simply means &ldquo;law&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Now Herder would, I think, reject any such legalistic concept of
&ldquo;human rights&rdquo; in principle. Consider, first of all, the
conception of human rights as either God&rsquo;s law or natural law.
Herder would reject the idea that we should regard such rights as
deriving directly from God&rsquo;s law for reasons that are similar to
those that lead him to reject the idea that human language or other
natural phenomena are directly attributable to God.</p>

<p>
What about a conception of human rights as natural law? Herder would
be equally dissatisfied with this way of conceiving them as a type of
law. Friedrich Meinecke in his justly famous book <em>Historism: The
Rise of a New Historical Outlook</em> ([1936] 1972) indeed went as far
as to depict it as one of Herder&rsquo;s greatest philosophical
achievements to have <em>overthrown</em> the relevant conception of
natural law (and thereby ushered in a new historicism concerning
values). Meinecke&rsquo;s reading captures the most original,
valuable, and influential strand in Herder&rsquo;s thought, a strand
that is prominent in such works as <em>On the Change of Taste</em>
(1766), <em>This Too a Philosophy of History</em> (1774), and much of
the <em>Letters for the Advancement</em> (1793&ndash;7). For in this
strand of his thought Herder argues in sharp opposition to the natural
law tradition that all moral (and also aesthetic and prudential)
values are (1) profoundly variable between periods and cultures, and
even to some extent between individuals within a single period and
culture, and (2) based (not in divine commands or a normative
structure otherwise inscribed in the order of nature but) in human
beings&rsquo; very variable moral sentiments.</p>

<p>
So much for a conception of human rights as divine law or natural law.
But Herder would be equally skeptical about the traditional close
association of them with <em>positive</em> law as well. Why? His most
important reason is that positive law is different from, and needs to
be constrained by, the deeper phenomenon of <em>morality</em>, and
that the ideals that are involved in the area of &ldquo;human
rights&rdquo; really belong to the latter, deeper level. He
articulates this position in the <em>Letters for the Advancement</em>,
where he discusses it in connection with Romans law and morality and
concludes,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Let us then adopt the Greeks&rsquo; and Romans&rsquo; concept of
humanity, for this barbaric human right [<em>Menschenrecht</em>] makes
us shudder. (<strong>G7</strong>:151&ndash;3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Finally, while Herder nowhere goes as far as to deny that it is
legitimate and important to complement the moral ideals involved in
the area of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; with a codification of them
into law, he does worry that such codification tends to weaken them in
certain ways. He implies such a worry in the <em>Letters for the
Advancement</em> when he contrasts the simple morality of the Germanic
tribes favorably with the complex Roman law that succeeded it.</p>

<p>
For all of these reasons, Herder finds the attempt to capture the
substantive moral ideals governing the respectful treatment of other
human beings that he basically shares with champions of &ldquo;human
rights&rdquo; in terms of the concept of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo;
with its legal implications misguided. Instead, he prefers the
unequivocally moral concept of &ldquo;humanity&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
It seems arguable that his criticisms of conceptions of &ldquo;human
rights&rdquo; as divine or natural law and his criticisms of the
conception that they are intimately linked to positive law are well
founded, and that this fact does indeed pose a serious, indeed
potentially even fatal, problem for the very concept of &ldquo;human
rights&rdquo;, given its essential conceptual connection to the idea
of law.</p>

<p>
Herder also has a number of further worries (or at least likely
worries) about the concept of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; that lead him
prefer his own ideal of humanity. The concept of &ldquo;rights&rdquo;
essentially involves a concept of &ldquo;having&rdquo; rights and
thereby imports a conceptual connection to the legal institution of
<em>property</em>. But from a left-wing Christian perspective like
Herder&rsquo;s, such a conceptual exaltation of property must seem
objectionable.</p>

<p>
Moreover, the concept of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; leaves out, and
even undermines, some other very important moral protections. For one
thing, from its beginnings until today the concept has mainly been
oriented to protecting individual human beings against abuses by
<em>their own governments</em>. Herder certainly thinks that this is
extremely important. But he is equally concerned to protect
individuals against abuses <em>from</em> <em>outside their
countries</em>: war, imperialism, colonialism, enslavement, economic
exploitation, and so on. So the concept of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo;
is at best incomplete. But worse than that, it also readily lends
itself to a certain insidious and harmful misuse: that of distracting
from, and even providing an ideological rationalization for, types of
abuse of people that come from outside their countries, such as war
and imperialism. In this spirit Herder already writes in <em>This Too
a Philosophy of History</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The universal dress of philosophy and love of mankind can hide
oppressions, attacks on the true, personal freedom of human beings and
lands, citizens, and peoples, of just the sort that Cesare Borgia
would wish for. (<strong>HPW</strong> 351)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For another thing, it is a striking feature of Herder&rsquo;s moral
outlook that his moral sympathies extend beyond human beings to
include non-human animals as well. But anyone who adopts such a
position has grounds for viewing the concept of &ldquo;human
rights&rdquo; with some suspicion. (The concept of "humanity" might
seem vulnerable to the same objection, but it is arguably not. The
difference lies in the fact that whereas the concept of "human rights"
is mainly victim-focused, the concept of "humanity" is mainly
agent-focused. Consequently, whereas it would make no sense to
complain to a man beating a dog "But what about human rights?", it
makes perfectly good sense to complain to him "But where&rsquo;s your
humanity?")</p>

<p>
Finally, Herder also has the resources for developing some additional
objections to the concept of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo; that are
closely related to the preceding ones in various ways. At several
points in the <em>Letters for the Advancement</em> he makes the
plausible conceptual point that <em>rights entail duties</em>, and
this not only in the sense that one person&rsquo;s right is always
someone else&rsquo;s duty, but also in the sense that only individuals
who have relevant duties and take them seriously can have rights.
Moreover, rights are normally thought of as things that people can
<em>lay claim to</em>. Such conceptions no doubt makes good sense
within the legal context from which the concept of
&ldquo;rights&rdquo; was originally drawn. But they have very
unfortunate consequences when the concept is transferred to the moral
plane in the form of a doctrine of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo;. For
they make extending moral protection in the form of
&ldquo;rights&rdquo; to individuals who for one reason or another are
not able to have or live up to corresponding duties, not able to claim
their rights&mdash;say, because the morality of their culture does not
include a commitment to (relevant) rights, or because they are
children or mentally disabled, or because they are animals&mdash;into
a sort of conceptual absurdity.</p>

<p>
These, then, are some additional reasons (or at least likely reasons)
why Herder shies away from the concept of &ldquo;human rights&rdquo;,
preferring to replace it with the concept of
&ldquo;humanity&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="HerSec">6. Herder&rsquo;s Secularism</h3>

<p>
This can be seen from a comparison with Ernesti (probably the most
important of the Bible scholars just mentioned, and the one most
admired by Herder). Ernesti&rsquo;s great work, <em>Institutio
interpretis Novi Testamenti</em> (1761), which Herder singles out for
special praise, is a key statement of the sort of secularism in
question. Initially, the work seems to advocate a secularism identical
in spirit to Herder&rsquo;s, arguing that we must interpret biblical
books in the same way as profane texts, and <em>thereby</em> learn
whatever religious truth they contain. However, as the work develops,
matters become much cloudier. In this connection, it is important to
distinguish between two questions that can be asked concerning the
relation between divine inspiration and interpretation: (1) May
readers of sacred texts rely on a divine inspiration of
<em>themselves</em> (for example, by the Holy Spirit) bringing them to
a correct interpretation rather than on more usual interpretive means?
(2) May they assume in interpretation that because <em>the
texts&rsquo; authors</em> are divinely inspired the texts must be
completely true and therefore also completely self-consistent? When
Ernesti develops the details of his position it becomes clear that he
has really only advanced as far toward secularism as consistently
answering question (1) in the negative, <em>not question (2)</em>. His
failure to give a consistently negative answer to question (2) lands
him in flat contradiction with his official commitment to interpreting
sacred texts in exactly the same way as profane ones (for, of course,
as he indeed himself implies, in interpreting profane texts we may
<em>not</em> assume that the texts are throughout true and therefore
also self-consistent). It also seems intellectually indefensible in
other ways&mdash;merely a rather transparent attempt to, so to speak,
&ldquo;cook the books&rdquo; in favor of the Bible when interpreting
it. By contrast, the young Herder advances beyond Ernesti in his
secularism because he consistently answers <em>both</em> questions in
the negative, and thereby, unlike Ernesti, achieves a position that is
both self-consistent and otherwise intellectually defensible.
Moreover, Herder&rsquo;s actual interpretations of the Bible admirably
conform to this theoretical position, not only refraining from any
reliance on divine inspiration and instead employing normal
interpretive methods, but also frequently attributing false and even
inconsistent positions to the Bible (both to the Old Testament and to
the New).</p>

<h3 id="HerInf">7. Herder&rsquo;s Influence</h3>

<p>
For example (to begin with some cases that have already been touched
on), it was mainly Herder (not, as has often been supposed, Hamann)
who established the two fundamental theses that founded modern
philosophy of language: the thesis that thought essentially depends on
and is bounded by language and the thesis that meaning consists in
word-usage. It was mainly Herder who, on the basis of those two theses
in the philosophy of language (plus a third one), together with a
revolutionary recognition of radical mental difference, established
modern interpretation-theory, or &ldquo;hermeneutics&rdquo;, doing so
in ways that would subsequently be taken over by Schleiermacher in his
famous lectures on the subject and which would then be reformulated
even more systematically by the latter&rsquo;s pupil Boeckh. It was
Herder who by doing so also made a fundamental contribution to
establishing the methodological foundations of nineteenth-century
German classical scholarship (which rested on the
Schleiermacher-Boeckh methodology), thereby making possible the great
achievements of that scholarship and ultimately the achievements of
subsequent classical scholarship as well. It was Herder who through
this new theory of interpretation, together with specific interpretive
discoveries concerning the Bible grounded in it, made vital
contributions to the development of modern biblical scholarship. It
was Herder who, by recognizing the text-like character of visual art
and the proper principles for interpreting such art, made possible the
development of modern art history. It was Herder who, again on the
basis of his new philosophy of language together with his recognition
of radical mental difference, first developed a revolutionary new
theory of &ldquo;foreignizing&rdquo; translation that transformed not
only translation theory but also translation practice and which
remains the preeminent theory of translation to this day (e.g.,
through the work of Antoine Berman and Lawrence Venuti). It was Herder
who, through his theses in the philosophy of language, his discovery
of deep variations in thought and language between different
historical periods and cultures, his recognition of the fundamental
role of grammar in language and of deep variations in languages&rsquo;
grammatical structures, his empirical approach to investigating
languages and thereby the modes of thought that they enable, and in
other ways, inspired Friedrich Schlegel, Wilhelm von Humboldt, and
others to found modern linguistics. And it was Herder who with his new
philosophy of language and theory of interpretation, together with
further important contributions, did more than anyone else to
establish the modern discipline of cultural anthropology.</p>

<p>
Herder&rsquo;s influence on individual thinkers of note has been
enormous as well. For example, Goethe was transformed from being
merely a talented but rather conventional poet in his early years into
the great artist that he eventually became largely through the early
and constant impact on him of Herder&rsquo;s ideas. In particular,
beginning with their first encounter in Strasbourg in 1770, and during
several decades of friendship that followed, it was Herder who caused
Goethe to develop his deep commitment to a Spinozist monism and his
related fascination with natural science; to move away from the
conventional formalism of his earlier poetry toward a poetry of nature
and feeling (such a program was especially marked in Herder&rsquo;s
own thought at the time when they first met in the early 1770s); to
develop a deep love of Homer, ancient tragedy, Shakespeare, and
Ossian; to take a serious interest in the ballads of ordinary people;
to become a committed cosmopolitan; to see the importance of world
literature; and indeed, to develop the character of Faust in his great
play of that name, who, as G&uuml;nther Jacoby pointed out, was
largely modeled on Herder.</p>

<p>
Herder also influenced Nietzsche profoundly. This is true of
Nietzsche&rsquo;s philosophy of language&mdash;which in the early
Basel lectures, <em>The Gay Science</em> (1882/7), and elsewhere takes
over a version of Herder&rsquo;s position that thought is dependent on
language and thereby on society (albeit while in characteristically
Nietzschean fashion also going on to assert, in contradiction of
Herder, that there is a deeper sort of thought that is <em>not</em>
dependent on language or society), and which also takes over
Herder&rsquo;s conception of the deeply metaphorical nature of
language, for example, in projecting gender onto the world through
grammar and in the pervasive creative, individualistic transformations
that lead from object to stimulus to image to thought and language
(compare here Nietzsche&rsquo;s <em>On Truth and Lying in an
Extra-moral Sense</em> (1873) with Herder&rsquo;s <em>On Image,
Poetry, and Fable</em>; a mediating link in this connection was Gustav
Gerber&rsquo;s <em>Die Sprache als Kunst </em>(1871)). It is true of
Nietzsche&rsquo;s philosophy of mind&mdash;including its rejection of
dualism, its denial of any sharp division between the mental faculties
(especially between cognition and volition, or affects), its emphasis
on the unconscious, and its insistence on psychological individuality.
It is true of his philosophy of history&mdash;including its commitment
to radical mental difference across historical periods, cultures, and
individuals, and its use of the method of genealogy in order to throw
light on modern outlooks, a method that ultimately derived from
Herder&rsquo;s genetic method (partly via Hegel). And it is also true
of his moral philosophy, where his sophisticated form of
sentimentalism, his insistence on historical, cultural, and individual
variations and even oppositions in moral sentiments, his explanation
of moralities in terms of their function of serving specific societies
and modes of life, and his application of the genealogical method to
morality all derive from Herder.</p>

<p>
Other important nineteenth-century philosophers were deeply influenced
by Herder as well. For example, Wilhelm von Humboldt is deeply
indebted to him for his philosophy of language, his linguistics, his
theories of interpretation and translation, his ideal of
<em>Bildung</em>, and his liberal political philosophy;
Dilthey&rsquo;s whole approach to history and the human sciences is
heavily indebted to Herder as well; and even John Stuart Mill has
important debts to Herder, namely, in his liberal political philosophy
(largely via Humboldt).</p>

<p>
However, in order to round out this picture of Herder&rsquo;s massive
influence, let us also consider a further important aspect of it in a
little more detail: his fundamental role in the development of both of
the main philosophical movements that dominated German philosophy in
the generation after him, namely, German Romanticism and post-Kantian
German Idealism. For he massively prefigured both of these movements
and neither of them could have arisen without him.</p>

<p>
To begin with German Romanticism. Herder played an essential role in
Friedrich Schlegel&rsquo;s invention of the very <em>idea</em> of
&ldquo;Romanticism&rdquo;. For it was mainly Herder&rsquo;s theory of
the historical mutability of genres and of the mistakenness of judging
works from one genre in terms of the rules and purposes of another, in
particular as he applied it in the <em>Letters for the
Advancement</em> to the special case of the difference between ancient
and modern poetry, that stimulated Friedrich Schlegel to make the
famous shift in the course of writing his <em>On the Study of Greek
Poetry</em> (1795/7) that first gave birth to Romanticism: a shift
from an initial neo-classical position that modern poetry&rsquo;s
distinctive yearning for the infinite, individuality, mixing of
genres, and so on are simply violations of classical rules to a
position that they instead constitute a new type of poetry that has no
less value than classical poetry. And it was also Herder who,
especially in the <em>Letters for the Advancement</em>, contributed
several of the other traits that came to define Romantic poetry for
the Schlegel brothers (for example, a fusion of yearning for the
infinite with erotic yearning for a female beloved, and an
identification of the novel as the central Romantic genre).</p>

<p>
But Herder&rsquo;s contribution to German Romanticism also goes far
beyond that. One important example of this lies in German
Romanticism&rsquo;s neo-Spinozist monism in metaphysics or religion.
The Romantics&rsquo; adoption of such a position was largely a result
of Herder&rsquo;s prior development of it in <em>God: Some
Conversations</em>, and accordingly took over Herder&rsquo;s
modifications of Spinoza&rsquo;s position. For example, Schleiermacher
already adopted a version of Spinoza&rsquo;s metaphysical-religious
monism in the early 1790s, and in doing so incorporated into it
Herder&rsquo;s conception of the single principle in question as
primal <em>force</em> (rather than substance).</p>

<p>
Another important example lies in the philosophy of language,
hermeneutics, and translation theory. Schleiermacher essentially took
over Herder&rsquo;s revolutionary new principles in all three of these
areas. So too did Friedrich Schlegel.</p>

<p>
Another significant example lies in the philosophy of mind.
Schleiermacher, already beginning in the 1790s and then continuing in
his later lectures on psychology, took over three of Herder&rsquo;s
central principles in the philosophy of mind to form the core of his
own philosophy of mind: a denial of dualism in favor of a
non-reductive mental-physical monism; a denial of any sharp
distinction between cognition and volition; and an espousal of a form
of determinism.</p>

<p>
Another important example lies in aesthetics. As has already been
mentioned, Schleiermacher&rsquo;s aesthetics lectures are little more
than a reworking of Herder&rsquo;s systematic theory of the several
arts in the <em>Critical Forests</em>. Likewise, Friedrich
Schlegel&rsquo;s (much more important) theory of art is profoundly
indebted to Herder. For instance, Schlegel&rsquo;s considered theory
of both literary and non-linguistic artistic genres is basically the
same as Herder&rsquo;s. Moreover, he takes over Herder&rsquo;s
positions that non-linguistic art is normally text-like, bearing
meanings and thoughts and hence requiring interpretation, and that its
meanings and thoughts are to be explained in a refined narrow
expressivist manner as essentially dependent on the artist&rsquo;s
language.</p>

<p>
Finally, yet another important example lies in the area of ethics and
political philosophy. In particular, Friedrich Schlegel and
Schleiermacher, especially in their most important early period, took
over from Herder a deep commitment to the values of individuality,
liberalism, republicanism/democracy, and cosmopolitanism (including an
emphatic rejection of misogyny, antisemitism, and racism). Moreover,
they both embraced Herder&rsquo;s distinctive pluralist version of
cosmopolitanism (Schleiermacher in the <em>Monologues</em> (1800),
Schlegel in his roughly contemporary lectures on transcendental
philosophy).</p>

<p>
A similar picture of Herder&rsquo;s massive influence emerges in
connection with post-Kantian German Idealism: Schelling and Hegel.
Herder&rsquo;s influence here was fundamental and decisive (though, of
course, this does not exclude significant modifications of his ideas
or additional influences).</p>

<p>
The central example concerns Schelling and Hegel&rsquo;s metaphysical
monism, their &ldquo;absolute idealism&rdquo;, which largely derives
from Herder&rsquo;s neo-Spinozist monism. As can be seen from his
correspondence, Herder&rsquo;s commitment to a neo-Spinozist monism
antedates the <em>Pantheismusstreit</em> of 1785 between Jacobi and
Mendelssohn by more than ten years, and was therefore by no means
produced by the latter. Moreover, it was not Jacobi and Mendelssohn
who were mainly responsible for the great wave of enthusiasm for
neo-Spinozist monism that emerged in the next generation with the
Romantics and the German Idealists, for they were both deeply hostile
to Spinoza&rsquo;s position, but instead that great enthusiast for
Spinoza Herder (together with his fellow enthusiast Lessing and his
follower in enthusiasm Goethe). This is confirmed by the fact that the
main revisions of Spinoza&rsquo;s monism that Herder undertook in
<em>God: Some Conversations</em> were subsequently reproduced by the
versions of neo-Spinozist monism that were championed by both the
Romantics and the German Idealists.</p>

<p>
The main revisions of Herder&rsquo;s in question were: (1) a
<em>subjectivizing</em> of Spinoza&rsquo;s monistic principle (in
contrast to Spinoza, Herder attributes to it not only thoughts but
also understanding, volition, and intentions, and characterizes it as
mind or spirit, <em>Geist</em>); (2) a <em>dynamizing</em> of the
principle (Herder no longer like Spinoza characterizes it as
substance, but instead as force, <em>Kraft</em>); (3) a <em>closer
connection of the principle&rsquo;s (as well as finite minds&rsquo;)
thought with extension/matter</em>, namely by means of the concept of
force; (4) a <em>vitalizing, or teleologizing,</em> of forces, both in
the monistic principle itself and in the nature that is ultimately one
with it; and (5) an <em>ontological demoting</em> not only of time but
also of space to the rank of a mere appearance (Spinoza had himself
demoted time in this way but not space).</p>

<p>
With that broad picture before us, let us now consider Herder&rsquo;s
influence on Schelling and Hegel in a little more detail.
Schelling&rsquo;s preoccupation with Herder&rsquo;s ideas began early,
in his M.A. thesis <em>De prima malorum origine</em>
(1792)&mdash;which deals with Herder&rsquo;s mythological
interpretation of Genesis in his <em>Oldest Document of the Human
Species</em> (1774/6)&mdash;and in <em>On Myths, Historical Legends,
and Philosophemes of the Oldest World</em> (1792/3)&mdash;in which he
develops a Herder-inspired theory of mythology with the help of
Herder&rsquo;s <em>Treatise on the Origin</em> and <em>Ideas</em>.</p>

<p>
But Herder&rsquo;s most important influences on Schelling concern the
later emergence of Schelling&rsquo;s monistic absolute idealism and
his philosophy of nature. Already in <em>On the I as the Principle of
Philosophy or On the Unconditional in Human Knowledge</em> and in
<em>Philosophical Letters on Dogmatism and Criticism</em> (both 1795)
Schelling basically takes over Herder&rsquo;s revised version of
Spinoza&rsquo;s monism (albeit while omitting to mention Herder and
officially rejecting Spinoza). In particular, he incorporates
revisions (1) through (4). Concerning revision (5), the ontological
demotion of time and space, Schelling at least emphasizes the
ontological demotion of time.</p>

<p>
In his <em>Ideas for a Philosophy of Nature</em> (1797) (note the echo
of Herder&rsquo;s title <em>Ideas for a Philosophy of History of
Humanity</em>) and <em>On the World Soul</em> (1798) Schelling then
also takes over the beginnings of a philosophy of nature that Herder
had sketched at the start of the <em>Ideas</em> and especially at the
end of <em>God: Some Conversations.</em> Schelling in particular takes
over and further develops Herder&rsquo;s model there of a hierarchical
system of opposing vitalistic forces (for example, in the magnet, in
electricity, and in attraction/repulsion) that ascend to a sort of
equilibrium and order and which are ultimately grounded in an absolute
spirit.</p>

<p>
Both of Schelling&rsquo;s appropriations from Herder&rsquo;s theories
just mentioned later became central components of the explicitly
Spinozist &ldquo;Philosophy of Identity&rdquo; that Schelling began to
champion around the turn of the century, and which then strongly
influenced Hegel.</p>

<p>
Herder&rsquo;s influence on Hegel is even deeper and more extensive.
Like Schelling, Hegel famously went through a predominantly
theological-mythological phase in the 1790s during which
Herder&rsquo;s ideas exercised a strong influence on him. When Hegel
moved to Jena in 1800 and began a career as a philosopher, he largely
retained those Herderian ideas, and moreover went on to take over
further ideas from Herder (often modifying them in the process, to be
sure).</p>

<p>
Hegel took over Herder&rsquo;s neo-Spinozist monism, in ways that were
partly direct and partly indirect. First, he took over Herder&rsquo;s
neo-Spinozist conception of God as a mind or spirit [<em>Geist</em>]
in a direct way&mdash;initially in the late additions to <em>The
Positivity of the Christian Religion</em> (1795/6), then more
emphatically in <em>The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate</em>
(1798&ndash;1800). Both works deal with questions about the origin and
character of Judaism and Christianity that had long been central
topics of Herder&rsquo;s, and are accordingly strongly influenced by
Herder (who is mentioned there by name). The influence of
Herder&rsquo;s neo-Spinozist monistic conception of spirit is simply
part of this broader influence (accordingly, as Rosenkranz reports,
Hegel went on to write a review of Herder&rsquo;s <em>God: Some
Conversations</em> when its second edition appeared in 1800, a review
that is unfortunately now lost). Second, when Hegel moved to Jena
around the turn of the century he undertook a sort of fusion of this
basically religious monism with his friend Schelling&rsquo;s new
&ldquo;Philosophy of Identity&rdquo;, including its philosophy of
nature, which amounted to incorporating Herder&rsquo;s influences on
Schelling indirectly as well. In the course of the following few years
Hegel also strove to save the <em>subjectivity</em> of the monistic
principle involved, which had in the meantime been virtually lost by
Schelling himself while he was developing the &ldquo;Philosophy of
Identity&rdquo;, and indeed emphasized it increasingly as time went on
(see, for example, the preface of Hegel&rsquo;s <em>Phenomenology of
Spirit</em> [1807] where he insists that Spinoza&rsquo;s principle of
substance needs to be complemented with subjectivity). The upshot in
Hegel was a version of neo-Spinozist monism almost exactly like
Herder&rsquo;s, in particular a version of it that incorporated each
of Herder&rsquo;s revisions (1)&ndash;(5) in one way or another
(revision (5) specifically in Hegel&rsquo;s famous interpretation and
defense of Spinoza&rsquo;s monism as a form of acosmism).</p>

<p>
But Herder&rsquo;s influence on Hegel is not limited to Hegel&rsquo;s
monism and philosophy of nature. It also extends to a whole series of
further areas of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy (areas that arguably today
have more living relevance than its monism and philosophy of
nature).</p>

<p>
First, Hegel developed his conception of the transition from nature to
the (human) mind through a reflection on, and revision of, a position
of Herder&rsquo;s. In the <em>Ideas</em> Herder had argued that human
beings (a) exhibit a strong continuity with the &ldquo;realm of
animals&rdquo; (he even calls the animals their &ldquo;older
brothers&rdquo;) but (b) are distinguished from it by their possession
of spirit, constituting a special &ldquo;spiritual realm&rdquo;. As
can be seen from the ironically titled chapter of the
<em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> &ldquo;The Spiritual Animal
Realm&rdquo;, as well as from passages in his later <em>Reason in
History</em> (published posthumously in 1837), Hegel rejected (a), but
accepted (b). This produced his own systematic conception of the
transition from nature to (human) spirit.</p>

<p>
Second, Herder exerted a strong influence on Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy
of the human mind, or spirit, itself. For one thing, Herder&rsquo;s
anti-dualistic equation of the human mind with force in <em>On the
Cognition and Sensation</em> was initially taken over by Hegel around
the turn of the century, and then subjected by him to a subtle
revision. As we saw, Herder had presupposed a <em>realistic</em>
conception of force in general, according to which, while it is true
that force essentially involves corresponding physical behavior, it is
not reducible thereto. However, Hegel during his early Jena period
(1801&ndash;7) criticized this realistic conception of force and
replaced it with an anti-realistic conception that <em>did</em> reduce
force to corresponding physical behavior. This revision automatically
led Hegel to a straightforward identification of the mind in
particular with corresponding physical behavior, and hence to an even
stronger form of anti-dualism than Herder had championed. For another
thing, Herder&rsquo;s rejection in <em>On the Cognition and
Sensation</em> of hard and fast divisions between mental faculties,
for example, between cognition and sensation or between cognition and
volition, led to a similar rejection of such hard and fast divisions
in Hegel.</p>

<p>
Third, Herder exerted a strong influence on Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy
of language. This influence is evident in almost all phases of
Hegel&rsquo;s career, but is especially prominent in the
<em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em>, whose philosophy of language is
almost entirely indebted to and in agreement with Herder&rsquo;s. To
give just a few examples: (1) As we have seen, Herder had already in
early works such as <em>On Diligence</em> and the <em>Fragments</em>
championed the doctrine that thought is essentially dependent on and
bounded by language. In chapters of the <em>Phenomenology of
Spirit</em> such as &ldquo;Sense-certainty&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Phrenology&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The Artificer&rdquo;, as well as
in other works from the Jena period, Hegel assumes the same doctrine
(in addition taking over Herder&rsquo;s further conception that oral
language is more fundamental than written). (2) Especially in <em>On
the Cognition and Sensation</em>, Herder had championed the theory
that language, and therefore also thought, depends on a linguistic
community. This position too plays a central role in Hegel&rsquo;s
<em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> as well as in other works of his. (3)
In his <em>Treatise on the Origin</em> Herder had argued that the
whole human mind is dependent on thought and hence language,
intimately involving them both. Similarly, Hegel in the
<em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> characterizes language as the very
&ldquo;existence [<em>Dasein</em>]&rdquo; of the subject, or the mind,
and he continues to champion this Herderian conception strongly in as
late a text as the preface to the second edition of his <em>Science of
Logic</em> (1832). (4) In keeping with that position, Herder had
championed the thesis in <em>On the Cognition and Sensation</em> that
not only language and therefore thought but also the subject depends
on a linguistic community. This thesis too subsequently plays a
central role in Hegel&rsquo;s <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em>.</p>

<p>
Fourth, Herder exercised a strong influence on Hegel&rsquo;s
philosophy of history. Several components of this influence can be
distinguished: (1) Herder had argued in <em>This Too a Philosophy of
History</em> that history has a necessary course that works to fulfill
a final purpose, then in the <em>Ideas</em> he had identified the
purpose in question as the realization of (humanity or) reason. In the
<em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> and his lectures on the philosophy of
history Hegel takes over this position and develops it further. (2)
Especially in <em>This Too a Philosophy of History</em> Herder had
emphasized that the human spirit, or mind, changes in profound ways
over the course of history. Hegel adopts this position too, especially
in the <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> and other works concerned with
history. (3) In <em>Attempt at a History of Lyric Poetry</em> (1764),
the <em>Fragments</em> (1767/8), and <em>This Too a Philosophy of
History</em> (1774) Herder had developed a &ldquo;genetic&rdquo;
method that undertakes to explain modern spiritual or mental phenomena
in terms of their gradual development out of earlier historical
origins and antecedents. Hegel subsequently took over this method,
especially in his <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> (where he discusses
his version of it in the preface). (4) Finally, in <em>This Too a
Philosophy of History</em> Herder had extended the application of the
concept of <em>formation</em> [<em>Bildung</em>] from its then normal
use in connection with individuals and their education to
<em>humankind and its historical self-development as a whole as
well</em>. Hegel takes over this new broader application of the
concept of formation in the <em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em>. (This
list of Hegel&rsquo;s debts to Herder is by no means exhaustive.)</p>

<p>
In short, besides the many other important ways in which Herder
exercised a profound influence on his successors, he in particular did
so by making possible, and setting the core agendas for, both of the
main philosophical movements that emerged in Germany in the next
generation: German Romanticism and post-Kantian German Idealism.</p>

<p>
Why, then, did Herder receive so little public credit for these
enormous achievements? Largely because by the turn of the nineteenth
century this uncompromisingly independent-minded and critical spirit
had managed to alienate both of the main intellectual power bases in
Germany: Kant, Fichte, and their followers (through his ascerbic
public criticism of their philosophical ideas) and Goethe, Schiller,
and their admirers (through his criticism of their values and their
poetry). So after that no one had much professional interest in giving
Herder public credit for his achievements any more, rather very much
the contrary&mdash;despite the fact that he so richly deserved it.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 As Lewis
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisOPW">1986</a><a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisOPW">b</a>,
 61) puts it: &ldquo;A property is natural or unnatural
<em>simpliciter</em>, not relative to one or another world&rdquo;.
Cameron
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-CameronVN">2010</a>)
 is, unusually, open to its being contingent which properties are more
natural than which. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 This is not to say that there will be no work for philosophers to do:
even with a &ldquo;final theory&rdquo; in hand, it may be far from
obvious how to use it to settle questions about perfect naturalness.
</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 The decision which methods of constructing complex predicates to
allow may make a significant difference to the final ranking. </p>
</div>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Sider
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-SiderWBW">2011</a>,
 &sect;7.11.1), by contrast, is optimistic about the finite
definability of the properties we are interested in, although he also
suggests that an adequate account of relative naturalness will need to
appeal to other factors besides length of definition. It is worth
noting that many of the other factors he considers, such as whether a
property &ldquo;figures into simple and strong generalizations&rdquo;,
will apparently make it a contingent matter whether one property is
more or less natural than another. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 A terminological complexity in this domain is that philosophers
sometimes adopt policies of using certain grammatically singular words
as a shorthand for saying things that are officially to be cashed out
using plurals. The words &lsquo;plurality&rsquo; and
&lsquo;collection&rsquo; often play this role: for example,
&lsquo;Some pluralities are more natural than the plurality of
dogs&rsquo; would be a shorthand for &lsquo;There are some things that
are more natural than the dogs&rsquo;. Lewis uses &lsquo;class&rsquo;
in this way in some of his works (Lewis
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisOPW">1986</a><a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisOPW">b</a>,
 51, n. 37), although not in others (Lewis
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisPC">1991</a>).

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Jenkins
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-JenkinsJM">2013</a>
 (100&ndash;103) defends the intelligibility of naturalness for
propositions, and explores its potential relevance to
epistemology.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 In a standard higher-order setting, variable-binders make complex
predicates: \((&lambda;v_1\ldots v_n.&phi;)\) is an expression of type
\(&#10216;&alpha;_1,\ldots ,&alpha;_n&#10217;\) when \(&phi;\) is a
sentence and \(v_1,\ldots,v_n\) are variables of types
\(&alpha;_1,\ldots ,&alpha;_n\). The letter lambda here is just a
piece of punctuation, not an expression of some type. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Sider suggests an alternative formalism where &ldquo;dummy
variables&rdquo; of different syntactic types are deployed so that the
argument of &lsquo;structural&rsquo; is always grammatically a
sentence. For example, instead of &lsquo;Structural(and)&rsquo;, one
would write &lsquo;Structural(\(\mathsf{p}\) and
\(\mathsf{q}\))&rsquo;, where &lsquo;\(\mathsf{p}\)&rsquo; and
&lsquo;\(\mathsf{q}\)&rsquo; are dummy sentential variables. One can
then, interestingly, formulate claims where the argument of Structural
is built entirely from dummy variables, like
&lsquo;Structural(\(\mathsf{F} \mathsf{a}\))&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Structural(\(\mathsf{p}\))&rsquo;. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 In fact, Weatherson&rsquo;s main conclusion is that some quantities
are <em>fundamental</em>: he also argues that fundamentality (which he
equates with <em>ungroundedness</em>) is distinct from perfect
naturalness (which he defines in terms of the grounding of similarity
facts). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Rodriguez-Pereyra also needs to allow the arguments of his
resemblance predicate to be sets, and to appeal to Lewis-style
modal-realism (see Dorr
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-DorrRENGR">2005</a>).
 Paseau
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-PaseauRTP">2012</a>)
 develops a similar view, without the numerical primitive. Lewis
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisNWTU">1983</a>,
 n. 9) contemplates analysing perfect naturalness in terms of a
&ldquo;contrastive and variably polyadic&rdquo; resemblance-theoretic
predicate, which one class (or plurality) bears to another just in
case some perfectly natural property is instantiated by every member
of the former and no member of the latter. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Oddie
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-OddieVRD">2005</a>),
 inspired by G&auml;rdenfors
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-GardenforsCS">2000</a>),
 proposes that a predicate &ldquo;stands for a property&rdquo; just in
case it corresponds to a convex region in a &ldquo;quality
space&rdquo; in which distances correspond to degrees of
dissimilarity. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Lewis
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisRI">2001</a>)
 adopts a model in which two gradable factors detract from a
property&rsquo;s degree of naturalness: &ldquo;spread&rdquo;
(&ldquo;the maximum dissimilarity distance between instances&rdquo;)
and &ldquo;scatter&rdquo; (&ldquo;the way non-instances are
interspersed with instances&rdquo;). He denies however that this
constitutes the &lsquo;whole story about naturalness&rsquo;. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 A variant of this definition sums the degrees of naturalness of all
the <em>classes</em> that contain exactly one of \(x\) and \(y\). This
may give different results, unless we identify a class&rsquo;s degree
of naturalness with the sum of the degrees of naturalness of all the
properties whose extension it is. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 However it is not hopeless. The simplicity-of-definition criterion
for relative naturalness suggests that that, so long as there are only
countably many instantiated perfectly natural properties, all but
countably many of the instantiated properties have infinite
complexity. If these are given a score of 0, one could score the
remainder in such a way that the relevant sums converge. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 Note however that actual-world physics provides some reason to deny
that determinate mass-properties are equally natural, since a unique
choice of units (the &ldquo;Planck units&rdquo;) for mass (along with
length and duration) is determined by requiring the speed of light,
Newton&rsquo;s gravitational constant, and Planck&rsquo;s constant all
to be 1. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 If <em>being part of</em> is perfectly natural, reflexive, and
antisymmetric, we must have \(f(x)=y\) whenever \(f\) witnesses the
existential quantification in
 <em><a href="index-2.html#Duplication">Duplication</a></em>:
 \(x\) is the one and only part of \(x\) with every part of \(x\) as a
part, so \(f(x)\) must be a part of \(y\) with every part of \(y\) as
a part, hence identical to \(y\). (For more on reflexivity and
antisymmetry, see the entry on
 <a href="../mereology/index.html">mereology</a>).
 Bricker
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-BrickerIU">1996</a>)
 and Eddon
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-EddonPN">2007</a>)
 argue that parthood (and kindred mereological relations) should not
be counted as perfectly natural: however, in this setting there is
pressure to add a clause to
 <em><a href="index-2.html#Duplication">Duplication</a></em>
 explicitly requiring \(f\) to preserve parthood, as Bricker
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-BrickerIU">1996</a>)
 in fact does. (As Schwarz
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-SchwarzAM">2014</a>)
 notes, &lsquo;being part of&rsquo; occurs alongside
&lsquo;grue&rsquo; on Lewis&rsquo;s list illustrating how Armstrong&rsquo;s theory
does not posit universals corresponding to arbitrary predicates (Lewis
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisNWTU">1983</a>,
 345); given his enthusiasm about this aspect of Armstrong&rsquo;s view,
this provides some reason to think that Lewis would agree with Bricker
and Eddon that parthood (and identity) are not perfectly natural.)
</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Note that Lewis accepted both definitions. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 As explained in note
 <a href="#note-16">16</a>,
 this will follow if parthood is perfectly natural, reflexive, and
antisymmetric. Those who deny this might well want to modify
 <em><a href="index-2.html#Duplication">Duplication</a></em>
 by adding \(`f(x) = y\rsquo\) as an extra conjunct on the right hand
side; the claim that duplicate objects have the same perfectly natural
properties follows immediately from this revised version. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 The former thought is a natural way of cashing out the view that
&ldquo;space-time points are properties&rdquo;, defended by Teller
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-TellerSPQ">1987</a>),
 and discussed (under the name &lsquo;Monadicism&rsquo;) by Field
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-FieldCWDWST">1984</a>).
 Weatherson
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-WeathersonAMP">2006</a>)
 draws out the counterintuitive results of counting specific vector
properties as perfectly natural in applying
 <em><a href="index-2.html#Duplication">Duplication</a></em>,
 e.g. that oppositely oriented magnets cannot be duplicates. For one
response see Marshall
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-MarshallAI">2016</a>
 (n. 21). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Taken literally,
 <em><a href="index-2.html#CrossWorldDup">Cross-world Duplication</a></em>
 will be unacceptable to those who hold there could be new objects,
distinct from everything there actually is. Consider an object \(x\)
with three parts. For \(x\) as is at the actual world to be a
duplicate of \(y\) as it is at \(w\), \(y\) must have three parts at
\(w\), but that does not mean that there <em>are</em> three things
that are part of \(y\) at \(w\). Providing a non-face-value
interpretation of quantification over &ldquo;mere possibilia&rdquo;
that avoids this issue is a challenging task: see Fine
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-FinePP">2003</a>),
 Williamson
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-WilliamsonMLM">2013</a>),
 Fritz and Goodman
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-FritzGoodmanCI">2017</a>).
 </p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 Marshall
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-MarshallAITN">2012</a>)
 considers a fix where the function \(f\) in <em>Cross-world
Duplication</em> is required to be the identity function on its
domain. However (as Marshall points out) given the necessity of
distinctness, this definition counts properties like <em>not being
identical to Obama</em> as intrinsic, which may be unwelcome. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 Plate
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-PlateIPR">2018</a>)
 develops an analysis of intrinsicality using the resources of a
fine-grained theory of properties. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 <em><a href="index-2.html#Duplication">Duplication</a></em> is subject to the same worry when applied to
objects whose parts do not form a set, if there are such things. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 Alternatively, one could understand &lsquo;object&rsquo; to exclude
sets, and define an extended notion of &ldquo;mapping&rdquo; whereby
each function from objects to objects counts as &ldquo;mapping&rdquo;
any set to the set of things to which it maps its members. This
technique may also help with a related worry, which arises if
<em>properties</em> are not counted as &ldquo;objects&rdquo;, or if
property-talk is understood as a surrogate for higher-order
quantification. For example, if <em>contemplation</em> is a perfectly
natural relation between objects and properties and <em>loving</em> is
a perfectly natural relation between objects, an adequate definition
of qualitative indiscernibility should presumably imply that if \(x\)
and \(y\) are qualitatively indiscernible and \(x\) is contemplating
<em>loving \(x\)</em>, \(y\) is contemplating <em>loving \(y\)</em>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 This may be the only suggestion that Lewis takes there to be a
minimum as well as a maximum degree of naturalness. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 Given the world-relativised relation, we can say that \(F\) is
qualitative if and only if whenever \(x\) as it is at \(w\) is
qualitatively indiscernible from \(y\) as it is at \(w'\), \(x\) is
\(F\) at \(w\) just in case \(y\) is \(F\) at \(w'\). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>
 It is also true however that some fine-grained theories of properties
suggest analyses of qualitativeness which require no mention of
naturalness. For example, Khamara
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-KhamaraIATST">1988</a>)
 and Dorr
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-DorrTBFITBG">2016</a>)
 suggest that a monadic property \(F\) is qualitative just in case
there there is no object \(x\) and binary relation \(R\) such that
\(F\) is the property of bearing \(R\) to \(x\). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 Depending on our view about the issues discussed in note
 <a href="#note-20">20</a>,
 we might be able to get away with restricting the domain of \(f\) to
the set of things that <em>exist at</em> the world \(w_1\). The result
will be a claim of <em>strong global supervenience</em>, if we extend
the standard definition of that notion in the obvious way to allow for
sets containing both monadic and polyadic properties (see the entry on
 <a href="../supervenience/index.html">supervenience</a>).
 </p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>
 However the case is not so simple, as Dasgupta also suggests that
there may be different senses of &lsquo;possible&rsquo; in play, and

 In the posthumously published Lewis
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisRH">2009</a>
 (note 3), Lewis seems to change his mind about
 <a href="index-2.html#TSB">TSB</a>.
 Influenced by an influential argument of Armstrong&rsquo;s (Armstrong
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-ArmstrongTU">1978</a>,
 67&ndash;8), Lewis takes &ldquo;an infinitely complex world of
&lsquo;structures all the way down&rsquo;&hellip;to be a genuine
possibility, though a far-fetched one&hellip; [I]n such a world no
perfectly fundamental properties are instantiated, but only
near-enough fundamental properties.&rdquo;
 <a href="index-2.html#TSB">TSB</a>
 as stated would entail that any two such worlds which agree as
regards what things there are agree about everything. In response,
Lewis suggests revising
 <a href="index-2.html#TSB">TSB</a>
 in such a way that the relevant properties are not just the perfectly
natural ones, but also the &ldquo;near-enough fundamental&rsquo;
properties that are instantiated in infinitely complex worlds. Other
principles, such as
 <em><a href="index-2.html#Duplication">Duplication</a></em>
 and
 <em><a href="index-2.html#Indiscernibility">Indiscernibility</a></em>
 would require similar revision. This seems like a major shift from
Lewis&rsquo;s usual picture. (As Lewis
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisASU">1986a</a>,
 30) remarks, concerning the related argument from the possibility of
infinitely complex worlds to the existence of &ldquo;structural&rdquo;
universals: &ldquo;It is unseemly that so far-fetched a possibility,
as I take it to be, should do so much to constrain our theory of the
constitution of this world.&rdquo;) Schaffer
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-SchafferITAFL">2003</a>)
 argues that we have good (though not conclusive) reason to take the
actual world to be infinitely complex in the relevant way. Williams
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-WilliamsPOW">2007b</a>)
 argues that the kind of &ldquo;infinite complexity&rdquo; in whose
possibility there is good reason to believe is compatible with there
being many instantiated perfectly natural properties, with contingent
laws of nature providing for each such property a necessary and
sufficient condition involving the perfectly natural properties of and
relations among an object&rsquo;s parts. </p>

 <em>Necessitism</em>, the view that necessarily everything is
identical to something (Williamson

combined with the view that metaphysical necessity obeys an S5 modal

the present modal formulation of
 <em><a href="index-2.html#TSB">TSB</a></em>

 It is not entirely clear that Lewis was committed to either of these
minimality claims. Each rules out the claim that the conjunction of
two perfectly natural properties is itself perfectly natural. But
Lewis was in fact initially open to a package combining the analysis
of perfect naturalness as &ldquo;correspondence to a universal&rdquo;
with a theory positing conjunctions of universals, and as a result, he
explicitly declines to rule out perfectly natural properties that are
conjunctions of others (Lewis
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisNWTU">1983</a>,
 364). To render
 <em><a href="index-2.html#Minimality">Minimality</a></em>
 consistent with this option, we could replace &lsquo;distinct from
\(R\)&rsquo; with &lsquo;sharing no perfectly natural conjuncts with
\(R\)&rsquo;. Later, however, Lewis
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisRH">2009</a>,
 204) affirms that perfectly natural properties are &ldquo;not
conjunctive or structural&rdquo;. </p>

 Dorr uses the word &lsquo;fundamental&rsquo; rather than
&lsquo;perfectly natural&rsquo;, and Plate uses &lsquo;logically
simple&rsquo;. Moreover Plate seems to regard the claim that negations
of perfectly natural properties are <em>not</em> perfectly natural as
somehow built into the concept of perfect naturalness, which he takes
to be distinct from and more obscure than that of logical simplicity.
He suggests that we should either simply stop talking about perfect
naturalness, or attempt to analyse it as the conjunction of logical
simplicity and some difficult notion of &ldquo;positiveness&ldquo;.

 Similarly, Schaffer

 defends a view on which predicates of scientific theories at all
levels denote what he calls &ldquo;sparse properties&rdquo;, rejecting
the idea that there is any metaphysically interesting status that
predicates of physics have that predicates of biology lack: one of his
reasons is the view that the world may be infinitely complex in such a
way that there is no &ldquo;fundamental level&rdquo; (Schaffer

 Wilson

 For ways in which the idea that &ldquo;any pattern of instantiation
of any fundamental properties and relations is metaphysically
possible&rdquo; might be formulated using tools from model theory, and
some potential conflicts formulations of this idea and formulations of
the &ldquo;cut-and-paste&ldquo; idea behind the principle of
recombination, see Hawthorne and Russell

 Bacon (forthcoming: see
 <a href="index-2.html#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>)
 develops a form of combinatorialism that is in one way stronger and
in another way weaker than the view just discussed. It is weaker in
that it concerns a notion of possibility that Bacon takes to be more
permissive than metaphysical possibility (Bacon
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-BaconBN">2018</a>).
 It is stronger in that the patterns which perfectly natural
(&ldquo;fundamental&rdquo;) properties can realise aren&rsquo;t just a
matter of their <em>extensions</em>: for example, if there are two
fundamental binary relations \(R\) and \(S\), then it is (broadly)
possible for \(R\) to be the converse of \(S\) (i.e.&nbsp;to be
identical to \(\lambda xy.S(y,x)\)). Since the proposition that \(R\)
is the converse of \(S\) cannot be true without being (broadly)
necessary, Bacon&rsquo;s combinatorialism involves a failure of the
principle that whatever is (broadly) possibly necessary is true. </p>

 Lewis often seems to take for granted that some such &ldquo;fully
determinate&rdquo; properties are perfectly natural: e.g.&nbsp;he
characterises the perfectly natural properties as &ldquo;highly
specific&rdquo; (Lewis
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisOPW">1986b</a>,
 60) and &ldquo;not at all&hellip;determinable&rdquo; (Lewis
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisRH">2009</a>,
 204). Moreover, his doctrine of &ldquo;Humean Supervenience&rdquo;
seems to rule out the hypothesis that any of (iii)&ndash;(viii) are
perfectly natural, since it says that the only actually instantiated
perfectly natural properties are monadic properties of points or other
point-sized objects, and spatiotemporal distance relations (presumably
binary). (See the introduction to Lewis
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-LewisPP2">1986c</a>

 <a href="../david-lewis/index.html#5">David Lewis</a>.)
 Hawthorne
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-HawthorneQLM">2006</a>)
 argues that Lewis&rsquo;s commitments here lead to some dilemmas, best
resolved either by admitting some polyadic perfectly natural
mass-theoretic relations such as those in (vi), or sticking with (i)
while giving up on the &ldquo;simplicity of definition&rdquo;
criterion of relative naturalness. (See also Dorr and Hawthorne
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-DorrHawthorneNaturalness">2013</a>,
 &sect;3.4.) Nanay
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-NanayNPBD">2014</a>)
 argues that Lewis needs to hold that only
&ldquo;super-determinate&rdquo; properties are perfectly natural, but
that it is possible that the world is infinitely complex in such a way
that there are no super-determinate properties, and concludes that we
should &ldquo;dispose of the natural/unnatural distinction&rdquo;
altogether: he does not however consider options such as
(iii)&ndash;(viii). </p>

 Wang

 uses the incompatibility of determinate masses and related
considerations of this kind to argue against combinatorialism. By

certain surprising possibility claims: e.g. Saucedo

object&rsquo;s location to be disjoint from that of one of its parts,
and McDaniel

mereologically simple objects could be spatially extended. For an
example of combinatorialism being used together with premises about
modality to argue against claims of naturalness, see Dorr

 For similar reasons, Sider

 This is slightly simplified. Lewis also requires that the proposition
that \(P\) is a <em>regularity</em>, which plausibly amounts being
<em>qualitative</em>. A slight variant theory counts a proposition as
a law of nature just in case it belongs to <em>some</em> best system
(and is a regularity); these views diverge only in the very special
case where several systems are exactly tied for first place. In the
literature, &ldquo;systems&rdquo; are often identified with sets of
<em>interpreted sentences</em> rather than sets of propositions. </p>

 On Lewis&rsquo;s view lawhood (for regularities) is closed under
necessitation: if it is a law that nothing goes faster than light, it
is a law that no banana goes faster than light. Some would prefer a
more discriminating conception of lawhood where the latter proposition
does not count as a law. A &ldquo;best system&rdquo; analysis of
lawhood suited to this conception could identify laws with the
propositions expressed by the <em>axioms</em> of some maximally simple
axiomatisation of the best system. </p>

 Note that in much of the literature on laws of nature, laws of nature
are taken to be <em>interpreted sentences</em> (perhaps in some
language that no-one actually speaks) rather than propositions. This
allows for a simple identification of &ldquo;figuring in&rdquo; with
&ldquo;being expressed by one of the constituent words of&rdquo;, but
raises many problems. Lawhood for sentence cries out for explanation far more 
obviously than lawhood for propositions; and it is hard to imagine an explanation that
allows a sentence that is a law to express the
same proposition as a sentence that is not a law but does not invoke the
concept of naturalness, or something like it. </p>

Scores are assigned not to particular \(&#10216;C,V&#10217;\) pairs,
but to relations that map between members of the species to such
pairs. The &ldquo;fit&rdquo; score of such a relation is a matter of
how strongly members of the species are disposed to perform actions
that maximise the expected value of the \(V\)-function they are
related to in the \(C\)-function they are related to, while its
&lsquo;eligibility&rsquo; score is simply a matter of how natural it
(the relation) is. For an individual thinker \(a\) to have credence
function \(C\) and value function \(V\) is for \(a\) to be mapped to
\(\langle C,V\rangle\) by the relation that achieves the optimal
balance for \(a\)&rsquo;s species. This modification of the view does
without Lewis&rsquo;s invocation of the concept of evidence:
one&rsquo;s \(C\)-function is supposed to be one&rsquo;s actual
credence function, not one&rsquo;s hypothetical prior credence
function. </p>

&ldquo;the bent-straight distinction&rdquo;. But given the context and
Lewis&rsquo;s citation of his

 Jenkins
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-JenkinsJM">2013</a>)
 considers the related idea that more natural propositions are ipso
facto &ldquo;better justified&rdquo;, ceteris paribus, than less
natural ones. A worry about this (which Jenkins attributes to Aidan
McGlynn) stems from the combination of the following plausible
thoughts: (i) when \(p\) is more natural than \(q\), the negation of
\(p\) is more natural than the negation of \(q\); (ii) when \(p\) is
better justified than \(q\), the negation of \(p\) is worse justified
than the negation of \(q\). Unless we can fill in the &ldquo;ceteris
paribus&rdquo; clause more informatively, this leaves it unclear how
considerations of naturalness are supposed to be relevant to degrees
of justification. A similar issue arises for attempts to relate
naturalness to the notion of &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; used in theories
of inference to the best explanation. It might prompt a less
straightforward account of the relation between simplicity and
naturalness, on which a proposition and its negation can differ
greatly in simplicity without differing much in naturalness.
Alternatively, we could assign the job of distinguishing propositions
from their negations to some &ldquo;theoretical virtue&rdquo; other
than simplicity, perhaps along the lines of &ldquo;specificity&rdquo;
or &ldquo;strength&rdquo;. (Naturalness might have a further role to
play in the theory of this other factor.) </p>

 Note that (8) follows from the combination of (5) and (6): Suppose
\(p\) is partly definable from \(q\) and \(p\) is perfectly natural.
Suppose further that \(q\) is partly definable from \(r\). Then \(p\)
is partly definable from \(r\) by transitivity, so \(r\) is partly
definable from \(p\) by (5) and the fact that \(p\) is perfectly
natural, and so by transitivity again, \(r\) is partly definable from
\(q\). Generalising, everything from which \(q\) is partly definable
is partly definable from \(q\); so by (6), \(q\) is perfectly natural.
It is also worth noting that on the assumption that every
relation is identical to the converse of its converse and partially
definable from its converse, (8) entails that the converse of a
perfectly natural relation is itself perfectly natural, making trouble

the entry on

 A subtler worry about (5) and (6) arises in Dorr&rsquo;s theory. On
that theory, every property is partially definable from a higher-order
instantiation relation (\(&lambda;Xy.X(y)\)), since it is the result
of saturating one of argument of that relation with itself: for
example, <em>being charged</em> is identical to <em>instantiating
charge</em>: 

\[\operatorname{Charged} = \lambda\,x.(\lambda\,Xy.X(y))(\operatorname{Charged},x).
\]

 Since the only properties from which the
instantiation relation is partially definable are other
&ldquo;logical&rdquo; properties of a similar sort, the upshot is that
these are the only properties that are not strictly partially defined
from any properties. To address this worry, Dorr suggests, in effect,
modifying (5) and (6) by restricting the variable \(q\) to
&ldquo;non-logical&rdquo; (or &ldquo;impure&rdquo;) properties. </p>

 Even if they can make sense of full definability, those who have been
treating talk of properties as shorthand for higher-order
quantification will have trouble with the type-neutral generalisation
in &lsquo;some perfectly natural properties&rsquo;. However, even
those in this position should be able to make sense of strengthenings
of
 <em><a href="index-2.html#Defi">Definability</a></em>
 where the defining perfectly natural properties are required to belong 
to some finite collection of types, and perhaps too of the
infinite disjunction of all these strengthenings. </p>

 Similarly, if we identify the fact that \(R(x,y)\) with the fact that
\(x\) has the property <em>bearing \(R\) to \(y,\)</em> (5) will have
the even more bizarre consequence that when \(R(x,y)\) is ungrounded,
not only \(R\) but <em>bearing \(R\) to \(y\)</em> is perfectly
natural. However, we might try to avoid this particular bad result by
restricting (5) to qualitative properties. </p>

 Bricker
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-BrickerRGP">2006</a>,
 271) is optimistic about defining &ldquo;ontological
determination&rdquo; (a notion he takes to be expressed by &lsquo;in virtue
of&rsquo;) using modality together with naturalness, but he
only suggests a sufficient condition: a proposition is
ontologically determined by a class of propositions whenever it
supervenes on that class, and every proposition in the class is the
predication of a perfectly natural property.  McDaniel (<a href="index-2.html#ref-McDanielFB">2017a</a>, ch.&nbsp;8) proposes that grounding is either identical to the <em>more real than</em> relation (which he takes to be necessarily coextensive with <em>more natural than</em>), or a disjunction in which each disjunct is the conjunction of <em>more real than</em> with some other relation, suggesting that entailment (metaphysical necessitatation) might be one of those other relations.

 This reason for dissatisfaction applies even more strongly to
formulas like &ldquo;Metaphysically speaking, all [properties] are
equal&rdquo; (Nanay
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-NanayNPBD">2014</a>).
 If we affirm or deny that certain things are &ldquo;equal&rdquo; we
naturally invite the clarificatory question &ldquo;Equal in what
respect?&rdquo;. It is quite unclear how
&ldquo;<em>metaphysically</em> equal&rdquo; could be a helpful answer
to that question, unless it is just synonymous with &ldquo;equally
natural&rdquo;. </p>

 For the notion of vagueness at work here, see the entry on
 <a href="../vagueness/index.html">vagueness</a>.
 Lewis does not explicitly address the question of vagueness but is
most naturally interpreted as holding that &lsquo;perfectly
natural&rsquo; is precise while &lsquo;more natural than&rsquo; is
somewhat vague. On standard ways of developing the connection between
naturalness and reference, one would expect that insofar as we can
refer to a perfectly natural property at all we are normally in a
position to do so precisely; those who agree with Sider
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-SiderWBW">2011</a>)
 that perfect naturalness is <em>perfectly</em> natural
(&ldquo;structure is structural&rdquo;) will then likely think that precision for &lsquo;perfectly
natural&rsquo; is at least within our reach. Sud
 (<a href="index-2.html#ref-SudVNEMV">2018</a>),
 however, while defending a view on which &lsquo;perfectly
natural&rsquo; is irremediably vague, rejects the argument from this view to the
claim that perfect naturalness is not perfectly natural. </p>

<h1>The Lambda Calculus</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Dec 12, 2012; substantive revision Wed Mar 21, 2018</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-calculus is, at heart, a simple notation for functions
and application. The main ideas are <em>applying</em> a function to an
argument and forming functions by <em>abstraction</em>. The syntax of
basic \(\lambda\)-calculus is quite sparse, making it an elegant, focused
notation for representing functions. Functions and arguments are on a
par with one another. The result is a non-extensional theory of
functions as rules of computation, contrasting with an extensional
theory of functions as sets of ordered pairs. Despite its sparse
syntax, the expressiveness and flexibility of the \(\lambda\)-calculus
make it a cornucopia of logic and mathematics. This entry develops
some of the central highlights of the field and prepares the reader
for further study of the subject and its applications in philosophy,
linguistics, computer science, and logic.</p>

<h2><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-calculus is an elegant notation for working with
<em>applications</em> of <em>functions</em> to <em>arguments</em>. To
take a mathematical example, suppose we are given a simple polynomial
such as
\(x^2 -2\cdot x+5\).
What is the value of this expression when \(x = 2\)? We compute
this by &lsquo;plugging in&rsquo; 2 for \(x\) in the expression: we
get \(2^2 -2\cdot 2+5\),
which we can further reduce to get the answer 5. To use the
\(\lambda\)-calculus to represent the situation, we start with the
\(\lambda\)-term</p>

\[
\lambda x[x^2 -2\cdot x+5].
\]

<p>
The \(\lambda\) operators allows us to <em>abstract</em> over \(x\).
One can intuitively read
&lsquo;\(\lambda x[x^2 -2\cdot x+5]\)&rsquo;
as an expression that is waiting for a value \(a\) for the variable
\(x\). When given such a value \(a\) (such as the number 2), the
value of the expression is
\(a^2 -2\cdot a+5\).
The &lsquo;\(\lambda\)&rsquo; on its own has no significance; it merely
<em>binds</em> the variable \(x\), guarding it, as it were, from
outside interference. The terminology in \(\lambda\)-calculus is that we
want to <em>apply</em> this expression to an <em>argument</em>, and
get a value. We write &lsquo;\(Ma\)&rsquo; to denote the
application of the function \(M\) to the argument \(a\).
Continuing with the example, we get:</p>

\[\begin{align}
(\lambda x[x^2 -2\cdot x+5])2 \rhd 2^2&amp; -2\cdot 2+5
   &amp;\langle \text{Substitute 2 for } x\rangle \\
&amp;= 4-4+5
   &amp;\langle\text{Arithmetic}\rangle \\
&amp;= 5 
   &amp;\langle\text{Arithmetic}\rangle
\end{align}\]

<p>
The first step of this calculation, plugging in &lsquo;2&rsquo; for
occurrences of \(x\) in the expression &lsquo;<span class="nw">\(x^2 - 2\cdot x +
5\)</span>&rsquo;, is the passage from an <strong><em>abstraction term</em></strong>
to another term by the operation of substitution. The remaining
equalities are justified by computing with natural numbers.</p>

<p>
This example suggests the central principle of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus,
called <strong><em>\(\beta\)-reduction</em></strong>, which is also
sometimes called <strong><em>\(\beta\)-conversion</em></strong>:</p>

\[
\tag{\(\beta\)}
(\lambda x[M])N \rhd M[x := N]
\]

<p>
The understanding is that we can <em>reduce</em> or <em>contract</em>
\((\rhd)\) an application \((\lambda xM)N\) of an abstraction term
(the left-hand side, \(\lambda xM)\) to something (the right-hand
side, \(N)\) by simply plugging in \(N\) for the occurrences of \(x\)
inside \(M\) (that&rsquo;s what the notation &lsquo;\(M[x :=
N]\)&rsquo;
expresses).  <strong><em>\(\beta\)-reduction</em></strong>,
or <strong><em>\(\beta\)-conversion</em></strong>, is the heart of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus.  When one actually applies \(\beta\)-reduction
to reduce a term, there is an important proviso that has to be
observed. But this will be described in Section 2.1, when we discuss
bound and free variables.</p>

<h3><a name="MulArgOpe">1.1 Multi-argument operations</a></h3>

<p>
What about functions of multiple arguments? Can the \(\lambda\)-calculus
represent operations such as computing the length of the hypotenuse of
a right triangle:</p>

<p class="indent">
Hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length \(x\) and
\(y \Rightarrow \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).</p>

<p>
The length-of-hypotenuse operation maps two positive real numbers
\(x\) and \(y\) to another positive real number. One can
represent such multiple-arity operations using the apparatus of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus by viewing the operation as taking one input at a
time. Thus, the operation can be seen as taking one input, \(x\), a
positive real number, and producing as its value not a
<em>number</em>, but an <em>operation</em>: namely, the operation that
takes a positive real number \(y\) as input and produces as output
the positive real number \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). One
could summarize the discussion by saying that the operation, 
<span class="sc"><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span>,
that computes the length
of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths \(a\) and
\(b\) of its legs, is:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="sc"><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span> \(:= \lambda a[\lambda b[\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}]]\)</p>

<p>
By the principle of \(\beta\)-reduction, we have, for example, that 
<span class="sc"><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span>
3, the application of <span class="sc"><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span>
to 3, is
\(\lambda b[\sqrt{3^2 + b^2}]\), which is a
function of that is &lsquo;waiting&rsquo; for another argument. The
\(\lambda\)-term <span class="sc"><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span> 3 can
be viewed as a function that computes the length of the hypotenuse of
a right triangle one of whose legs has length 3. We find,
finally, that (<span class="sc"><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span>
3)4&mdash;the application of <span class="sc"><strong>hypotenuse-length</strong></span>
to 3 and then to 4&mdash;is
5, as expected.</p>

<p>
Another way to understand the reduction of many-place functions to
one-place functions is to imagine a machine \(M\) that initially
starts out by loading the first \(a\) of multiple arguments
\(a, b,\ldots\) into memory. If one then suspends the
machine after it has loaded the first argument into memory, one can
view the result as another machine M\(_a\) that is
awaiting one fewer input; the first argument is now fixed.</p>

<h3><a name="Non-Extensionality">1.2 Non-Extensionality</a></h3>

<p>An important philosophical issue concerning the \(\lambda\)-calculus
is the question of its underlying concept of functions. In set theory,
a function is standardly understood as a set of argument-value
pairs. More specifically, a function is understood as a
set \(f\) of ordered pairs satisfying the property that
\((x,y) \in f\) and \((x,z) \in f\)
implies \(y = z\). If \(f\) is a function and
\((x,y) \in f\), this means that the function f assigns
the value \(y\) to the argument \(x\). This is the concept of
<strong><em>functions-as-sets</em></strong>. Consequently, the notion of
equality of functions-as-sets is equality <em>qua</em> sets, which,
under the standard principle of extensionality, entails that two
functions are equal precisely when they contain the same ordered
pairs. In other words, two functions are identical if and only if they
assign the same values to the same arguments. In this sense,
functions-as-sets are
<em>extensional</em> objects.</p>

<p>In contrast, the notion of a function at work in \(\lambda\)-calculus
is one where functions are understood as <em>rules</em>: a function is
given by a rule for how to determine its values from its
arguments. More specifically, we can view a \(\lambda\)-term
\(\lambda x[M]\) as a description of an operation that,
given \(x\), produces \(M\); the body \(M\) of the
abstraction term is, essentially, a <em>rule</em> for what to do with
\(x\). This is the conception
of <strong><em>functions-as-rules</em></strong>. Intuitively, given
rules \(M\) and \(N\), we cannot in general decide whether
\(\lambda x[M]\) is equal to \(\lambda x[N]\). The
two terms might &lsquo;behave&rsquo; the same (have the same value
given the same arguments), but it may not be clear what resources are
needed for showing the equality of the terms. In this sense,
functions-as-rules are <em>non-extensional</em> objects.</p>

<p>To distinguish the extensional concept of functions-as-sets from
the non-extensional concept of functions-as-rules, the latter is often
referred to as an <em>&lsquo;intensional&rsquo;</em> function concept,
in part because of the ostensibly intensional concept of a rule
involved. This terminology is particularly predominant in the
community of mathematical logicians and philosophers of mathematics
working on the foundations of mathematics. But from the perspective of
the philosophy of language, the terminology can be somewhat
misleading, since in this context, the extensional-intensional
distinction has a slightly different meaning.</p>

<p>In the standard possible-worlds framework of philosophical
semantics, we would distinguish between an extensional and an
intensional function concept as follows. Let us say that that two
functions are <em>extensionally equivalent at a world</em> if and only if they
assign the same values to the same arguments at that world. And
let us say that two functions are <em>intensionally equivalent</em> if
and only if they assign the same values to the same arguments at
<em>every</em> possible-world. To illustrate, consider the functions
<span class="sc"><strong>highest-mountain-on-earth</strong></span> and <span
class="sc"><strong>highest-mountain-in-the-Himalayas</strong></span>, where
 <span class="sc"><strong>highest-mountain-on-earth</strong></span>
 assigns the highest mountain on
earth as the value to every argument and
 <span class="sc"><strong>highest-mountain-in-the-Himalayas</strong></span>
 assigns
the highest mountain in the Himalayas as the value to every
argument. The two functions are extensionally equivalent (at the
actual world), but not intensionally so. At the actual world, the two
functions assign the same value to every argument, namely
Mt. Everest. Now consider a world where Mt. Everest is not the highest
mountain on earth, but say, Mt. Rushmore is. Suppose further that this
is so, just because Mt. Rushmore is 30.000 feet/9.100 m higher than it
is at the actual world, while Mt. Everest, with its roughly 29.000
feet/8.800 m, is still the highest mountain in the Himalayas. At that
world,
 <span class="sc"><strong>highest-mountain-on-earth</strong></span>
 now assigns Mt. Rushmore as the value to
every argument, while
 <span class="sc"><strong>highest-mountain-in-the-Himalayas</strong></span> 
 still assigns Mt. Everest to
every object. In other words, 
<span class="sc"><strong>highest-mountain-on-earth</strong></span> and
 <span class="sc"><strong>highest-mountain-in-the-Himalayas</strong></span> are
extensionally equivalent (at the actual world) but not intensionally equivalent.</p>

<p>A function concept may now be called <em>extensional</em> if and
only if it requires functions that are extensionally equivalent at the
actual world to be identical. And a function concept may be classified
as <em>intensional</em> if and only if it requires intensionally
equivalent functions to be identical. Note that these classifications
are conceptually different from the distinctions commonly used in the
foundations of mathematics. On the terminology used in the foundations
of mathematics, functions-as-sets are classified as extensional since
they use the axiom of extensionality as their criterion of identity,
and functions-as-rules are classified as intensional because they rely
on the ostensibly intensional concept of a rule. In the present
possible-worlds terminology, function concepts are classified as
extensional or intensional based of their behavior at
possible-worlds.</p>

<p>
An issue from which conceptual confusion might arise is that the two
terminologies potentially pass different verdicts on the function concept at work
in the \(\lambda\)-calculus. To see this, consider the following two functions:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\addone &amp;:= \lambda x[x+1] \\
\addtwosubtractone &amp;:= \lambda x[[x+2]-1] 
\end{align}\]

<p>
These two functions are clearly extensionally equivalent: they assign
the same value to the same input at the actual world. Moreover, given
standard assumptions in possible worlds semantics, the two functions
are also <em>intensionally</em> equivalent. If we assume that
mathematical facts, like facts about addition and subtraction, are
necessary in the sense that they are the same at every possible world,
then we get that the two functions give the same value to the
arguments at <em>every</em> possible world. So, an intensional function
concept would require the two functions to be identical. In
the \(\lambda\)-calculus, however, it&rsquo;s not clear at all that we should
identify the two functions. Formally speaking, without the help of
other principle, we cannot show that the two \(\lambda\)-terms denote the
same function. Moreover, informally speaking, on the conception of
<em>functions-as-rules</em>, it&rsquo;s not even clear that we <em>should</em>
identify them: the two terms involve genuinely different rules, and so
we might be tempted to say that they denote different functions.</p>

<p>A function concept that allows for intensionally equivalent
functions to be distinct is called <strong><em>hyperintensional</em></strong>. The point
is that in possible-worlds terminology, the function concept at work
in the \(\lambda\)-calculus may be regarded not as intentional but
<em>hyper</em>intensional&mdash;in contrast to what the terminology
common in the foundations of mathematics says. Note that it&rsquo;s unclear
how an intensional semantic framework, like the possible-worlds
framework, could even in principle account for a non-intensional
function concept. On the semantics of the \(\lambda\)-calculus, see
section <a href="#SemLCal">7</a>. The point here was simply to clarify
any conceptual confusions that might arise from different
terminologies at play in philosophical discourse.</p>

<p>
The hyperintensionality of the \(\lambda\)-calculus is particularly
important when it comes to its applications as a theory of not only
functions, but more generally <em>\(n\)-ary relations</em>. On
this, see section
 <a href="#Relations">9.3</a>.
 It is effectively the hyperintensionality of the \(\lambda\)-calculus
that makes it an attractive tool in this context. It should be noted,
however, that the \(\lambda\)-calculus can be made extensional (as well
as intensional) by postulating additional laws concerning the equality
of \(\lambda\)-terms. On this, see section
 <a href="#LThe">5</a>.</p>
 

<h2><a name="Syn">2. Syntax</a></h2>

<p>
The official syntax of the \(\lambda\)-calculus is quite simple; it is
contained in the next definition.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> For the alphabet of the language of the
\(\lambda\)-calculus we take the left and right parentheses, left and
right square brackets, the symbol &lsquo;\(\lambda\)&rsquo;, and an
infinite set of variables. The class of <strong><em>\(\lambda\)-terms</em></strong>
is defined inductively as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>Every variable is a \(\lambda\)-term.</li>

<li>If \(M\) and \(N\) are \(\lambda\)-terms, then so is
\((MN)\).</li>

<li>If \(M\) is a \(\lambda\)-term and \(x\) is a variable, then
\((\lambda x[M])\) is a \(\lambda\)-term.</li>
</ol>

<p>
By &lsquo;term&rsquo; we always mean &lsquo;\(\lambda\)-term&rsquo;.
Terms formed according to rule (2) are called <strong><em>application
terms</em></strong>. Terms formed according to rule (3) are called
<strong><em>abstraction terms</em></strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>
As is common when dealing with formal languages that have grouping
symbols (the left and right parenthesis, in our case), some
parentheses will be omitted when it is safe to do so (that is, when
they can be reintroduced in only one sensible way). Juxtaposing more
than two \(\lambda\)-terms is, strictly speaking, illegal. To avoid the
tedium of always writing all needed parentheses, we adopt the
following convention:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Convention</strong> (association to the left): When more than
two terms \(M_1 M_2 M_3 \ldots M_n\) are juxtaposed we can recover the
missing parentheses by <strong><em>associating to the
left</em></strong>: reading from left to right, group \(M_1\) and
\(M_2\) together, yielding \((M_1 M_2)M_3 \ldots M_n\); then group
\((M_1 M_2)\) with \(M_3\): \(((M_1 M_2)M_3)\ldots M_n\), and so
forth.</p>

<p>
The convention thus gives a unique reading to any sequence of
\(\lambda\)-terms whose length is greater than 2.</p>

<h3><a name="VarBouFre">2.1 Variables, bound and free</a></h3>

<p>
The function of \(\lambda\) in an abstraction term
\((\lambda x[M]\)) is that it <strong><em>binds</em></strong> the
variable appearing immediately after it in the term \(M\). Thus
\(\lambda\) is analogous to the universal and existential quantifiers
\(\forall\) and \(\exists\) of first-order logic. One can define,
analogously, the notions of free and bound variable in the expected
way, as follows.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> The syntactic functions \(\mathbf{FV}\) and
\(\mathbf{BV}\) (for &lsquo;free variable&rsquo; and &lsquo;bound
variable&rsquo;, respectively) are defined on the set of \(\lambda\)-terms by
structural induction thus:</p>

<p>For every variable \(x\), term \(M\), and term \(N\):</p>

\[\begin{array}{lll}
  &amp;\text{Free}
  &amp;\text{Bound} \\
(1)
  &amp;\mathbf{FV}(x) = \{ x \} \quad 
  &amp;\mathbf{BV}(x) =  \varnothing \\
(2)
  &amp;\mathbf{FV}(MN) = \mathbf{FV}(M) \cup \mathbf{FV}(N)
  &amp;\mathbf{BV}(MN) = \mathbf{BV}(M) \cup \mathbf{BV}(N) \\
(3)
  &amp;\mathbf{FV}(\lambda x[M]) = \mathbf{FV}(M) - \{ x \}
  &amp;\mathbf{BV}(\lambda x[M]) = \mathbf{BV}(M) \cup \{ x \}
\end{array}\]

<p>
If \(\mathbf{FV}(M) = \varnothing\) then \(M\) is called a
<strong><em>combinator</em></strong>.</p>
</div>

<p>
Clause (3) in the two definitions supports the intention that \(\lambda\)
binds variables (ensures that they are not free). Note the difference
between \(\mathbf{BV}\) and \(\mathbf{FV}\) for variables.</p>

<p>
As is typical in other subjects where the concepts appear, such as
first-order logic, one needs to be careful about the issue; a casual
attitude about substitution can lead to syntactic
 difficulties.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 We can defend a casual attitude by adopting the convention that we
are interested not in terms themselves, but in a certain equivalence
class of terms. We now define substitution, and then lay down a
convention that allows us to avoid such difficulties.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> (substitution) We write
&lsquo;\(M[x := N]\)&rsquo; to denote the
substitution of \(N\) for the free occurrences of \(x\) in
\(M\). A precise
 definition<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 by recursion on the set of \(\lambda\)-terms is as follows: for all
terms \(A\), \(B\), and \(M\), and for all variables \(x\)
and \(y\), we define</p>

<ol>

<li>\(x[x := M] \equiv M\) </li>

<li>\(y[x := M] \equiv y\) (\(y\) distinct from \(x)\)</li>

<li>\((AB)[x := M] \equiv A[x := M]B[x := M]\)</li>

<li>\((\lambda x[A])[x := M] \equiv \lambda x[A]\)</li>

<li>\((\lambda y[A])[x := M] \equiv \lambda y[A[x := M]]\) 
 (\(y\) distinct from \(x)\)</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Clause (1) of the definition simply says that if we are to substitute
\(M\) for \(x\) and we are dealing simply with \(x\), then
the result is just \(M\). Clause (2) says that nothing happens when
we are dealing (only) with a variable different from \(x\) but we
are to substitute something for \(x\). Clause (3) tells us that
substitution unconditionally distributes over applications. Clauses
(4) and (5) concern abstraction terms and parallel clauses (1) and (2)
(or rather, clauses (2) and (1), in opposite order): If the bound
variable \(z\) of the abstraction term \(\lambda z[A]\)
is identical to the variable \(x\) for which we are to do a
substitution, then we do not perform any substitution (that is,
substitution &ldquo;stops&rdquo;). This coheres with the intention
that \(M[x := N]\) is supposed to denote the
substitution of \(N\) for the <em>free</em> occurrences of \(x\)
in \(M\). If \(M\) is an abstraction term
\(\lambda x[A]\) whose bound variable is \(x\), then
\(x\) does not occurr freely in \(M\), so there is nothing to
do. This explains clause 4. Clause (5), finally, says that if the
bound variable of an abstraction term differs from \(x\), then at
least \(x\) has the &ldquo;chance &rdquo; to occur freely in the
abstraction term, and substitution continues into the body of the
abstraction term.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> (change of bound variables,
\(\alpha\)-convertibility).
The term \(N\) is obtained from the term \(M\) by a <strong><em>change
of bound variables</em></strong> if, roughly, any abstraction term
\(\lambda x[A]\) inside \(M\) has been replaced by
\(\lambda y[A[x := y]]\).</p>

<p>
Let us say that terms \(M\) and \(N\) are
<strong><em>\(\alpha\)-convertible</em></strong> if there is a
sequence of changes of bound variables starting from \(M\) and ending
at \(N\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Axiom</strong>. <strong><em>\(\beta\)-conversion</em></strong>
(stated with a a no-capture proviso):</p>

<p class="center">
\( (\lambda x[M])N \rhd M[x := N]\),<br/> provided no variable that
occurrs free in \(N\) becomes bound after its substitution into
\(M\).</p>

</div>

<p>
Roughly, we need to adhere to the principle that free variables ought
to remain free; when an occurrence of a variable is threatened to
become bound by a substitution, simply perform enough
\(\alpha\)-conversions to sidestep the problem. If we keep this in
mind, we can work with \(\lambda\)-calculus without worrying about
these nettlesome syntactic difficulties.  So, for example, we can't
apply the function \(\lambda x[\lambda y[x(y-5)]]\) to the argument
\(2y\) because upon substitution of &ldquo;\(2y\)&rdquo; for
&ldquo;\(x\)&rdquo;, the &ldquo;\(y\)&rdquo; in &ldquo;\(2y\)&rdquo;
would be captured by the variable-binding operator &ldquo;\(\lambda
y\)&rdquo;.  Such a substitution would yield a function different from
the one intended. However, we can first transform \(\lambda x[\lambda
y[x(y-5)]]\) to \(\lambda x[\lambda z[x(z-5)]]\) by
\(\alpha\)-conversion, and then apply this latter function to the
argument \(2y\).  So whereas the following is <em>not</em> a valid use of
\(\beta\)-conversion:

   \[ (\lambda x[\lambda y[x(y-5)]])2y  \rhd \lambda y[2y(y-5)]\]

we can validly use \(\beta\)-conversion to conclude:

   \[ (\lambda x[\lambda z[x(z-5)]])2y \rhd \lambda z[2y(z-5)]\]

This example helps one to see why the proviso to \(\beta\)-conversion
is so important.  The proviso is really no different from the one used
in the statement of an axiom of the predicate calculus, namely:
\(\forall x\phi \to \phi^{\tau}_x\), provided no variable that is free
in the term \(\tau\) before the substitution becomes bound after the
substitution.</p>

<p>
The syntax of \(\lambda\)-calculus is quite flexible. One can form all
sorts of terms, even self-applications such as \(xx\). Such
terms appear at first blush to be suspicious; one might suspect that
using such terms could lead to inconsistency, and in any case one
might find oneself reaching for a tool with which to forbid such
terms. If one were to view functions and sets of ordered pairs of a
certain kind, then the \(x\) in \(xx\) would be a
function (set of ordered pairs) that contains as an element a pair
\((x,y)\) whose first element would be \(x\) itself. But
no set can contain itself in this way, lest the axiom of foundation
(or regularity) be violated. Thus, from a set theoretical perspective
such terms are clearly dubious. Below one can find a brief sketch of
one such tool, type theory. But in fact such terms do not lead to
inconsistency and serve a useful purpose in the context of
\(\lambda\)-calculus. Moreover, forbidding such terms, as in type theory,
does not come for free (e.g., some of the expressiveness of untyped
\(\lambda\)-calculus is lost).</p>

<h3><a name="Com">2.2 Combinators</a></h3>

<p>
As defined earlier, a <strong><em>combinator</em></strong> is a \(\lambda\)-term with
no free variables. One can intuitively understand combinators as
&lsquo;completely specified&rsquo; operations, since they have no free
variables. There are a handful of combinators that have proven useful
in the history of \(\lambda\)-calculus; the next table highlights some of
these special combinators. Many more could be given (and obviously
there are infinitely many combinators), but the following have concise
definitions and have proved their utility. Below is a table of some standard
\(\lambda\)-terms and combinators.</p>

to be understood as the application
\((xz)(yz)\) of \(xz\) to
\(yz. \bS\) can thus be understood as a
substitute-and-apply operator: \(z\) &lsquo;intervenes&rsquo;
between \(x\) and \(y\): instead of applying \(x\) to
\(y\), we apply \(xz\) to \(yz\).</td> </tr>

\mathbf{Y}X &amp;\rhd (\lambda x[X(xx)])(\lambda x[X(xx)]) \\
   &amp;\rhd X((\lambda x[X(xx)])(\lambda x[X(xx)]))

The first step in the reduction shows that \(\mathbf{Y}\)X reduces
to the application term \((\lambda x[X(xx)])(\lambda x[X(xx)]\)),
which is recurring in the third step. Thus, \(\mathbf{Y}\) has the curious

\(\mathbf{Y}\) does not have this property.)</td> </tr>

 <td>\(MN\)</td>
 <td>The application of the function \(M\) to the argument \(N\).
<p>
Usually, parentheses are used to separate the function from the
argument, like so: &lsquo;\(M(N)\)&rsquo;. However, in
\(\lambda\)-calculus and kindred subjects the parentheses are used as
grouping symbols. Thus, it is safe to write the function and the

 <td>\(PQR\)</td>
 <td>The application of the function \(PQ\)&mdash;which is

If we do not use parentheses to separate function and argument, how
are we to disambiguate expressions that involve three or more terms,
such as &lsquo;\(PQR\)&rsquo;? Recall our convention that we are to
understand such officially illegal expressions by working from left to
right, always putting parentheses around adjacent terms. Thus,
&lsquo;\(PQR\)&rsquo; is to be understood as \((PQ)R\).
&lsquo;\(PQRS\)&rsquo; is \(((PQ)R)S\). The expression
&lsquo;\((PQ)R\)&rsquo; is disambiguated; by our convention, it is
identical to \(PQR\). The expression &lsquo;\(P(QR)\)&rsquo; is also
explicitly disambiguated; it is distinct from \(PQR\) because it is
the application of \(P\) to the argument \(QR\) (which is itself the
application of the function \(Q\) to the argument
\(R)\).</p></td> </tr>

<tr>
 <td>\((\lambda x[M])\)</td>
 <td>The \(\lambda\) term that <strong><em>binds</em></strong> the variable \(x\)
in the \(\boldsymbol{body}\) term \(M\).

<p>
The official vocabulary of the \(\lambda\)-calculus consists of the
symbol &lsquo;\(\lambda\)&rsquo;, left &lsquo;(&rsquo;and right
&lsquo;)&rsquo; parentheses, and a set of variables (assumed to be
distinct from the three symbols &lsquo;\(\lambda\)&rsquo;,
&lsquo;(&rsquo;, and &lsquo;)&rsquo; lest we have syntactic
chaos).</p>

<p>
<strong>Alternative notation</strong>. It is not necessary to include
two kinds of grouping symbols (parentheses and square brackets) in the
syntax. Parentheses or square brackets alone would obviously suffice.
The two kinds of brackets are employed in this entry for the sake of
readability. Given the two kinds of grouping symbols, we could
economize further and omit the parentheses from abstraction terms, so
that &lsquo;\((\lambda x[M]\))&rsquo; would be written as
&lsquo;\(\lambda x[M]\)&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Some authors write &lsquo;\(\lambda x.M\)&rsquo; or
&lsquo;\(\lambda x\cdot M\)&rsquo;, with a full stop or a
centered dot separating the bound variable from the body of the
abstraction term. As with the square brackets, these devices are
intended to assist reading \(\lambda\)-terms; they are usually not part
of the official syntax. (One sees this device used in earlier works of
logic, such as <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, where the function of
the symbol <strong>.</strong> in expressions such as
&lsquo;\(\forall x\)<strong>.</strong>\(\phi\)&rsquo; is to get us to
read the whole of the formula \(\phi\) as under the scope of the
\(\forall x\).)</p>

<p>
Some authors write abstraction terms without any device separating the
bound variable from the body: such terms are crisply written as, e.g.,
&lsquo;\(\lambda xx\)&rsquo;,
&lsquo;\(\lambda yx\)&rsquo;. The practice is not without
its merits: it is about as concise as one can ask for, and permits an
even simpler official syntax of the \(\lambda\)-calculus. But this
practice is not flawless. In
&lsquo;\(\lambda xyz\)&rsquo;, is the bound variable
\(x\) or is it \(xy\)? Usually the names of variables are
single letters, and theoretically this is clearly sufficient. But it
seems unduly restrictive to forbid the practice of giving longer names
to variables; indeed, such constructions arise naturally in computer
programming languages.</p>

<p>
For the sake of uniformity, we will adopt the square bracket notation
in this entry. (Incidentally, this notation is used in (Turing,
1937).)</p> </td> </tr>

\[
M[x/A], M[A/x], M_{x}^A, M_{A}^x, [x/A]M,\ldots
\]

<p>
Which notation to use for substitution seems to be a personal matter.
In this entry we use a linear notation, eschewing superscripts and
subscripts. The practice of representing substitution with
&lsquo;:=&rsquo; comes from computer science, where &lsquo;:=&rsquo;
is read in some programming languages as assigning a value to a
variable.</p>

<p>
As with the square brackets employed to write abstraction terms, the
square brackets employed to write substitution are not officially part
of the syntax of the \(\lambda\)-calculus. \(M\) and A are terms,
\(x\) is a variable; \(M[x := A]\) is another

The syntactic identity relation \(\equiv\) is not part of the official
syntax of \(\lambda\)-calculus; this relation between \(\lambda\)-terms
belongs to the metatheory of \(\lambda\)-calculus. It is clearly a rather
strict notion of equality between \(\lambda\)-terms. Thus, it is not the

<h2><a name="BriHisLCal">3. Brief history of \(\lambda\)-calculus</a></h2>

<p>
\(\lambda\)-calculus arose from the study of functions as rules. Already
the essential ingredients of the subject can be found in Frege&rsquo;s
pioneering work (Frege, 1893). Frege observed, as we did above, that
in the study of functions it is sufficient to focus on unary functions
(i.e., functions that take exactly one argument). (The procedure of
viewing a multiple-arity operation as a sequence of abstractions that
yield an equivalent unary operation is called <strong><em>currying</em></strong>
the operation. Perhaps it would be more historically accurate to call
the operation <strong><em>fregeing</em></strong>, but there are often miscarriages
of justice in the appellation of mathematical ideas.) In the 1920s,
the mathematician Moses Sch&ouml;nfinkel took the subject further with
his study of so-called <em>combinators</em>. As was common in the
early days of the subject, Sch&ouml;nfinkel was interested in the
kinds of transformations that one sees in formal logic, and his
combinators were intended to be a contribution to the foundations of
formal logic. By analogy with the reduction that one sees in classical
propositional logic with the Sheffer stroke, Sch&ouml;finkel
established the astonishing result that the all functions (in the
sense of all transformations) could be given in terms of the
combinators \(\mathbf{K}\) and \(\bS\); later we will see the definition of
these combinators.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem</strong> For every term \(M\) made up of \(\mathbf{K}\)
and \(\bS\) and the variable \(x\), there exists a term \(F\)
(built only from \(\mathbf{K}\) and \(\bS)\) such that we can derive
\(Fx = M\).</p>

<p>
(The proof that these two suffice to represent all functions is beyond
the scope of this entry. For further discussion, see the entry on
 <a href="../logic-combinatory/index.html">combinatory logic</a>.)
 One can prove the theorem constructively: there is an algorithm that,
given \(M\), produces the required \(F\). Church called this
\(F\) &lsquo;\(\lambda x[M]\)&rsquo; (Church,
 1932).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 From this perspective, the \(\beta\)-rule can be justified: if
&lsquo;\(\lambda x[M]\)&rsquo; is to be a function \(F\)
satisfying \(Fx = M\), then
\(\lambda x[M]\)x should transform to \(M\). This is just
a special case of the more general principle that for all \(N,
(\lambda x[M])N\) should transform to
\(M[x := N]\).</p>

<p>
Although today we have more clearly delimited systems of abstraction
and rewriting, in its early days \(\lambda\)-calculus and combinatory
logic (&agrave; la Sch&ouml;nfinkel) were bound up with investigations
of foundations of mathematics. In the hands of Curry, Church, Kleene,
and Rosser (some of the pioneers in the subject) the focus was on
defining mathematical objects and carrying out logical reasoning
inside the these new systems. It turned out that these early attempts
at so-called illative \(\lambda\)-calculus and combinatory logic were
inconsistent. Curry isolated and polished the inconsistency; the
result is now known as Curry&rsquo;s paradox. See the entry on
 <a href="../curry-paradox/index.html">Curry&rsquo;s paradox</a>
 and appendix B of (Barendregt, 1985).</p>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-calculus earns a special place in the history of logic
because it was the source of the first undecidable problem. The
problem is: given \(\lambda\)-terms \(M\) and \(N\), determine
whether <span class="nw">\(M = N\)</span>. (A theory of
equational reasoning about \(\lambda\)-terms has not yet been defined;
the definition will come later.) This problem was shown to be
undecidable.</p>

<p>
Another early problem in the \(\lambda\)-calculus was whether it is
consistent at all. In this context, inconsistency means that all terms
are equal: one can reduce any \(\lambda\)-term \(M\) to any other
\(\lambda\)-term \(N\). That this is not the case is an early result
of \(\lambda\)-calculus. Initially one had results showing that certain
terms were not interconvertible (e.g., \(\mathbf{K}\) and \(\bS)\); later,
a much more powerful result, the so-called Church-Rosser theorem,
helped shed more light on \(\beta\)-conversion and could be used to give
quick proofs of the non-inter-convertibility of whole classes of
\(\lambda\)-terms. See below for more detailed discussion of
consistency.</p>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-calculus was a somewhat obscure formalism until the
1960s, when, at last, a &lsquo;mathematical&rsquo; semantics was
found. Its relation to programming languages was also clarified. Till
then the only models of \(\lambda\)-calculus were
&lsquo;syntactic&rsquo;, that is, were generated in the style of
Henkin and consisted of equivalence classes of \(\lambda\)-terms (for
suitable notions of equivalence). Applications in the semantics of
natural language, thanks to developments by Montague and other
linguists, helped to &lsquo;spread the word&rsquo; about the subject.
Since then the \(\lambda\)-calculus enjoys a respectable place in
mathematical logic, computer science, linguistics (see, e.g., Heim and
Kratzer 1998), and kindred fields.</p>

<h2><a name="Red">4. Reduction</a></h2>

<p>
Various notions of reduction for \(\lambda\)-terms are available, but the
principal one is \(\beta\)-reduction, which we have already seen earlier.
Earlier we used the notation &lsquo;\(\rhd\)&rsquo;; we can be more
precise. In this section we discuss \(\beta\)-reduction and some
extensions.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> (one-step \(\beta\)-reduction
\(\rhd_{\beta ,1})\) For \(\lambda\)-terms \(A\) and \(B\),
we say that \(A\) \(\beta\)-reduces in one step to \(B\), written
\(A \rhd_{\beta ,1} B\), just in case there
exists an (occurrence of a) subterm \(C\) of \(A\), a variable
\(x\), and \(\lambda\)-terms \(M\) and \(N\) such that \(C \equiv(\lambda x[M])N\) and \(B\) is \(A\)
except that the occurrence of \(C\) in \(A\) is replaced by
\(M[x := N]\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Here are some examples of \(\beta\)-reduction:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
The variable \(x\) does not \(\beta\)-reduce to anything. (It does not
have the right shape: it is simply a variable, not an application term
whose left-hand side is an abstraction term.)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\((\lambda x[x])a \rhd_{\beta ,1} a\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If \(x\) and \(y\) are distinct variables, then
\((\lambda x[y])a \rhd_{\beta ,1} y\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-term
\((\lambda x[(\lambda y[xy])a])b]\) \(\beta\)-reduces in one step to two different \(\lambda\)-terms:</p>

\[
(\lambda x[(\lambda y[xy])a])b \rhd_{\beta ,1} (\lambda y[by])a
\]

<p>
and</p>

\[
(\lambda x[(\lambda y[xy])a])b \rhd_{\beta ,1} (\lambda x[xa])b
\]

<p>
Moreover, one can check that these two terms \(\beta\)-reduce in one step
to a common term: \(ba\). We thus have:</p>

As with any binary relation, one can ask many questions about the
relation \(\rhd_{\beta ,1}\) holding between \(\lambda\)-terms,
and one can define various derived notions in terms of
\(\rhd_{\beta ,1}\).</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> A <strong><em>\(\beta\)-reduction sequence</em></strong>
from a \(\lambda\)-term \(A\) to a \(\lambda\)-term \(B\) is a finite
sequence \(s_1 , \ldots s_n\) of
\(\lambda\)-terms starting with \(A\), ending with \(B\), and whose
adjacent terms
\((s_k,s_{k+1})\) satisfy
the property that \(s_k \rhd_{\beta ,1} s_{k+1}\).</p>

<p>
More generally, any sequence \(s\)&mdash;finite or
infinite&mdash;starting with a \(\lambda\)-term \(A\) is said to be a
\(\beta\)-reduction sequence commencing with \(A\) provided that the

variable, then this \(\beta\)-reduction sequence cannot be prolonged, and
there are no other \(\beta\)-reduction sequences commencing with
\((\lambda x[x])a\); thus, the set of
\(\beta\)-reduction sequences commencing with
\((\lambda x[x])a\) is finite and contains no
infinite sequences.</p></li>

<li id="beta-reduction-sequence-example-3">The combinator
\(\boldsymbol{\Omega}\) has the curious property that \(\Omega \rhd_{\beta ,1} \Omega\). Every term of every

<strong>Definition</strong> A <strong><em>\(\beta\)-redex</em></strong> of a

comes from &lsquo;reducible expression.) A \(\beta\)-redex is simply a
candidate for an application of \(\beta\)-reduction. Doing so, one
<strong><em>contracts</em></strong> the \(\beta\)-redex. A term is said to be in
<strong><em>\(\beta\)-normal form</em></strong> if it has no \(\beta\)-redexes.</p>

<p>
(Can a term have multiple \(\beta\)-normal forms? The answer is literally
&lsquo;yes&rsquo;, but substantially the answer is &lsquo;no&rsquo;:
If a \(M\) and \(M'\) are \(\beta\)-normal forms of some
term, then \(M\) is \(\alpha\)-convertible to \(M'\) Thus,
\(\beta\)-normal forms are unique up to changes of bound variables.)</p>

Reducibility as defined is a one-way relation: it is generally not
true that if \(A \rhd_{\beta} B\), then \(B \rhd_{\beta} A\). However, depending on one&rsquo;s
purposes, one may wish to treat \(A\) and \(B\) as equivalent if
either \(A\) reduces to \(B\) or \(B\) reduces to \(A\).
Doing so amounts to considering the reflexive, symmetric, and

<h3><a name="OthNotRed">4.1 Other notions of reduction</a></h3>

<p>
We have thus far developed the theory of \(\beta\)-reduction. This is by
no means the only notion of reduction available in the
\(\lambda\)-calculus. In addition to \(\beta\)-reduction, a standard
relation between \(\lambda\)-terms is that of
<strong><em>\(\eta\)-reduction</em></strong>:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition</strong> (one-step \(\eta\)-reduction) For
\(\lambda\)-terms \(A\) and \(B\), we say that \(A\) \(\beta
\eta\)-reduces in one step to \(B\), written \(A \rhd_{\beta \eta ,1}
B\), just in case there exists an (occurrence of a) subterm \(C\) of
\(A\), a variable \(x\), and \(\lambda\)-terms \(M\) and \(N\) such
that either</p>

<p class="indent">
\(C \equiv(\lambda x[M])N\) and \(B\) is
\(A\) except that the occurrence of \(C\) in \(A\) is
replaced by \(M[x := N]\)</p>

<p>
or</p>

<p class="indent">
\(C \equiv(\lambda x[Mx]\)) and \(B\) is
\(A\) except that the occurrence of \(C\) in \(A\) is
replaced by \(M\).</p>

</div>

<p>
The first clause in the definition of \(\rhd_{\beta \eta ,1}\)
ensures that the relation extends the relation of one-step
\(\beta\)-reduction. As we did for the relation of one-step
\(\beta\)-reduction, we can replay the development for \(\eta\)-reduction.
Thus, one has the notion of an \(\eta\)-redex, and from
\(\rhd_{\eta ,1}\) one can define the relation
\(\rhd_{\eta}\) between \(\lambda\)-terms as the symmetric and
transitive closure of \(\rhd_{\eta ,1}\), which captures
zero-or-more-steps of \(\eta\)-reduction. Then one defines
\(=_{\eta}\) as the symmetric and transitive closure of
\(\rhd_{\eta}\).</p>

<p>
If \(A \rhd_{\eta ,1} B\), then the length of
\(B\) is strictly smaller than that of \(A\). Thus, there can be
no infinite \(\eta\)-reductions. This is not the case of
\(\beta\)-reduction, as we saw above in
 <a href="#beta-reduction-sequence-example-3">\(\beta\)-reduction sequence examples 3</a>
 and
 <a href="#beta-reduction-sequence-example-4">4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
One can combine notions of reduction. One useful combination is to
blend \(\beta\)- and \(\eta\)-reduction.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Definition</strong> (one-step \(\beta \eta\)-reduction)
\(\lambda x[Mx] \rhd_{\beta \eta ,1} M\) and \((\lambda x[M]N))
\rhd_{\beta \eta ,1} M[x := N]\). A
\(\lambda\)-term \(A\) \(\beta \eta\)-reduces in one step to a
\(\lambda\)-term \(B\) just in case either \(A\) \(\beta\)-reduces to
\(B\) in one step or \(A\) \(\eta\)-reduces to \(B\) in one
step.</p>

<p>
Again, one can replay the basic concepts of reduction, as we did for
\(\beta\)-reduction, for this new notion of reduction \(\beta \eta\).</p>

<h3><a name="RedStr">4.2 Reduction strategies</a></h3>

<p>
Recall that a term is said to be in \(\beta\)-normal form if it has no
\(\beta\)-redexes, that is, subterms of the shape
\((\lambda x[M]\))N. A term has a \(\beta\)-normal form if it
can be reduced to a term in \(\beta\)-normal form. It should be
intuitively clear that if a term has a \(\beta\)-normal form, then we can
find one by exhaustively contracting all all \(\beta\)-redexes of the
term, then exhaustively contracting all \(\beta\)-redexes of all
resulting terms, and so forth. To say that a term has a \(\beta\)-normal
form amounts to saying that this blind search for one will eventually
terminate.</p>

<p>
Blind search for \(\beta\)-normal forms is not satisfactory. In addition
to be aesthetically unpleasant, it can be quite inefficient: there may
not be any need to exhaustively contract all \(\beta\)-redexes. What is
wanted is a <em>strategy</em>&mdash;preferably, a computable
one&mdash;for finding a \(\beta\)-normal form. The problem is to
effectively decide, if there are multiple \(\beta\)-redexes of a term,
which ought to be reduced.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Definition</strong> A <strong><em>\(\beta\)-reduction strategy</em></strong>
is a function whose domain is the set of all \(\lambda\)-terms and whose
value on a term \(M\) not in \(\beta\)-normal form is a redex subterm
of \(M\), and whose value on all terms M in \(\beta\)-normal form is
simply \(M\).</p>

<p>
In other words, a \(\beta\)-reduction strategy selects, whenever a term
has multiple \(\beta\)-redexes, which one should be contracted. (If a
term is in \(\beta\)-normal form, then nothing is to be done, which is
why we require in the definition of \(\beta\)-reduction strategy that it
does not change any term in \(\beta\)-normal form.) One can represent a
strategy \(S\) as a relation \(\rhd_S\) on \(\lambda\)-terms,
with the understanding that \(M \rhd_S N\)
provided that \(N\) is obtained from \(M\) in one step by
adhering to the strategy S. When viewed as relations, strategies
constitute a subrelation of \(\rhd_{\beta ,1}\).</p>

<p>
A \(\beta\)-reduction strategy may or may not have the property that
adhering to the strategy will ensure that we (eventually) reach a
\(\beta\)-normal form, if one exists.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Definition</strong> A \(\beta\)-reduction strategy \(S\) is
<strong><em>normalizing</em></strong> if for all \(\lambda\)-terms \(M\), if
\(M\) has a \(\beta\)-normal form \(N\), then the sequence
\(M, S(M), S(S(M)),\ldots\)
terminates at \(N\).</p>

<p>
Some \(\beta\)-reduction strategies are normalizing, but others are
not.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong><em>rightmost strategy</em></strong>, whereby we always choose to
reduce the rightmost \(\beta\)-redex (if there are any \(\beta\)-redexes) is
not normalizing. Consider, for example, the term <strong>KI\(\omega\)</strong>.
This term has two \(\beta\)-redexes: itself, and <strong>\(\omega\)</strong> (which,
recall, is the term
\((\lambda\)x[\(xx])(\lambda\)x[\(xx]\))). By
working with left-hand \(\beta\)-redexes, we can \(\beta\)-reduce
<strong>KI\(\omega\)</strong> to \(\mathbf{I}\) in two steps. If we insist on working
with the rightmost \(\beta\)-redex <strong>\(\omega\)</strong> we reduce
<strong>KI\(\omega\)</strong> to \(\mathbf{KI}\)(<strong>\(\omega \omega\)</strong>), then
\(\mathbf{KI}\)(<strong>\(\omega \omega \omega\)</strong>), &hellip;.</li>

<li>The <strong><em>leftmost strategy</em></strong>, whereby we always choose to
reduce the leftmost \(\beta\)-redex (if there are any \(\beta\)-redexes) is
normalizing. The proof of this fact is beyond the scope of this entry;
see (Barendregt, 1985, section 13.2) for details.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once we have defined a reduction strategy, it is natural to ask
whether one can improve it. If a term has a \(\beta\)-normal form, then a
strategy will discover a normal form; but might there be a shorter
\(\beta\)-reduction sequence that reaches the same normal form (or a term
that is \(\alpha\)-convertible to that normal form)? This is the question
of <em>optimality</em>. Defining optimal strategies and showing that
they are optimal is generally considerably more difficult than simply
defining a strategy. For more discussion, see (Barendregt, 1984
chapter 10).</p>

<p>
For the sake of concreteness, we have discussed only \(\beta\)-reduction
strategies. But in the definitions above the notion of reduction
\(\beta\) is but one possibility. For any notion \(R\) of reduction we
have the associated theory of \(R\)-reduction strategies, and one
can replay the problems of normalizability, optimality, etc., for
\(R\).</p>

<h2><a name="LThe">5. \(\lambda\)-theories</a></h2>

<p>
We discussed earlier how the \(\lambda\)-calculus is a non-extensional
theory of functions. If, in the non-extensional spirit, we understand
\(\lambda\)-terms as descriptions, how should we treat equality of
\(\lambda\)-terms? Various approaches are available. In this section, let
us treat the equality relation = as a primitive, undefined relation
holding between two \(\lambda\)-terms, and try to <em>axiomatize</em> the
properties that equality should have. The task is to identity axioms
and formulate suitable <strong><em>rules of inference</em></strong> concerning the
equality of \(\lambda\)-terms.</p>

<p>
Some obvious properties of equality, having nothing to do with
\(\lambda\)-calculus, are as follows:</p>

\[\tag{Reflexivity}
\frac{}{X=X}
\]

\[\tag{Symmetry}
\frac{X=Y}{Y=X}
\]

\[\tag{Transitivity}
\frac{X=Y \quad Y=Z}{X=Z}
\]

<p>
As is standard in proof theory, the way to read these rules of
inference is that above the horizontal rule \(\frac{}{\phantom{X=X}}\)
are the 
<strong><em>premises</em></strong> of the rule (which are equations) and the
equation below the horizontal rule is the <strong><em>conclusion</em></strong> of
the rule of inference. In the case of the reflexivity rule, nothing is
written above the horizontal rule. We understand such a case as saying
that, for all terms \(X\), we may infer the equation \(X = X\) from no premises.</p>

<h3><a name="BasTheL">5.1 The basic theory \(\lambda\)</a></h3>

<p>
The three rules of inference listed in the previous section governing
equality have nothing to do with the \(\lambda\)-calculus. The following
lists rules of inference that relate the undefined notion of equality
and the two term-building operations of the \(\lambda\)-calculus,
application and abstraction.</p>

\[
\frac{M=N}{AM=AN} \quad \frac{M=N}{MA=NA} \quad \frac{M=N}{\lambda x[M] = \lambda x[N]}
\]

<p>
These rules of inference say that = is a <strong><em>congruence
relation</em></strong> on the set of \(\lambda\)-terms: it
&lsquo;preserves&rsquo; both the application and abstraction
term-building operations</p>

<p>
The final rule of inference, \(\beta\)-conversion, is the most
important:</p>

\[\tag{\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)}
\frac{}{(\lambda x[M])A = M[x := A]}
\]

<p>
As before with the reflexivity rule, the rule \(\boldsymbol{\beta}\) has no
premises: for any variable \(x\) and any terms \(M\) and
\(A\), one can infer the equation
\((\lambda x[M])A = M[x := A]\)
at any point in a formal derivation in the theory \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\).</p>

<h3><a name="ExtBasTheL">5.2 Extending the basic theory \(\lambda\)</a></h3>

<p>
A number of extensions to \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\) are available. Consider, for
example, the rule (\(\boldsymbol{\eta}\)), which expresses the principle of
\(\eta\)-reduction as a rule of inference:</p>

\[\tag{\(\boldsymbol{\eta}\)}
\frac{}{\lambda x[Mx] = M} \text{ provided } x \not\in \mathbf{FV}(M)
\]

<p>
Rule \(\boldsymbol{\eta}\) tells us that a certain kind of abstraction is
otiose: it is safe to identify \(M\) with the function that, given
an argument \(x\), applies \(M\) to \(x\). Through this rule
we can also see that all terms are effectively functions. One can
intuitively justify this rule using the principle of
\(\beta\)-reduction.</p>

\[\tag{\(\mathbf{Ext}\)}
\frac{Mx=Nx}{M=N}\text{ provided } x \not\in \mathbf{FV}(M) \cup \mathbf{FV}(N)
\]

<p>
One can view rule \(\mathbf{Ext}\) as a kind of generalization principle. If
we have derived that \(Mx = Nx\), but \(x\)
figures in neither \(M\) nor \(N\), then we have effectively
shown that \(M\) and \(N\) are alike. Compare this principle to
the principle of universal generalization in first-order logic: if we
have derived \(\phi(x)\) from a set \(\Gamma\) of hypotheses in which
\(x\) is not free, then we can conclude that \(\Gamma\) derives
\(\forall x\phi\).</p>

<p>
Another productive principle in the \(\lambda\)-calculus permits us to
identify terms that &lsquo;act&rsquo; the same:</p>

\[\tag{\(\boldsymbol{\omega}\)}
\frac{\text{For all terms }x, Mx=Nx}{M=N}
\]

<p>
The rule \(\boldsymbol{\omega}\) has infinitely many hypotheses: on
the assumption that \(Mx = Nx\), no matter what \(x\) may be, then we
can conclude that \(M = N\). The \(\boldsymbol{\omega}\) rule is an
analogue in the \(\lambda\)-calculus of the rule of inference under
the same name in formal number theory, according to which one can
conclude the universal formula \(\forall x\phi\) provided one has
proofs for \(\phi(x := \mathbf{0}), \phi(x := \mathbf{1}),\ldots\)
. Note that unlike the rule \(\mathbf{Ext}\), the condition that \(x\)
not occur freely in \(M\) or \(N\) does not arise.</p>

<h2><a name="ConLCal">6. Consistency of the \(\lambda\)-calculus</a></h2>

<p>
Is the \(\lambda\)-calculus consistent? The question might not be
well-posed. The \(\lambda\)-calculus is not a logic for reasoning about
propositions; there is no apparent notion of contradiction \((\bot)\) or
a method of forming absurd propositions (e.g.,
\(p \wedge \neg p)\). Thus
&lsquo;inconsistency&rsquo; of the \(\lambda\)-calculus cannot mean that
\(\bot\), or some formula tantamount to \(\bot\), is derivable. A suitable
notion of &lsquo;consistent&rsquo; is, however, available.
Intuitively, a logic is inconsistent if it permits us to derive too
much. The theory <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong> is a theory of equations. We can thus
take inconsistency of <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong> to mean: <em>all equations are
derivable</em>. Such a property, if it were true of <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>,
would clearly show that <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong> is of little use as a formal
theory.</p>

<p>
Early formulations of the idea of \(\lambda\)-calculus by A. Church were
indeed inconsistent; see (Barendregt, 1985, appendix 2) or (Rosser,
1985) for a discussion. To take a concrete problem: how do we know
that the equation \(\bK = \mathbf{I}\) is not a theorem of
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>? The two terms are obviously intuitively distinct.
\(\bK\) is a function of two arguments, whereas \(\mathbf{I}\) is a
function of one argument. If we could show that
\(\bK = \mathbf{I}\), then we could show that \(\mathbf{KK} = \mathbf{IK}\), whence \(\mathbf{KK} = \bK\) would be a theorem of
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>, along with many other equations that strike us as
intuitively unacceptable. But when we&rsquo;re investigating a formal theory
such as <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>, intuitive unacceptability by no means implies
underivability. What is missing is a deeper understanding of
\(\beta\)-reduction.</p>

<p>
An early result that gave such an understanding is known as the
Church-Rosser theorem:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem</strong> (Church-Rosser) If \(P \rhd_{\beta} Q\) and \(P \rhd_{\beta}\) R, then there exists a term \(S\) such
that both \(Q \rhd_{\beta} S\) and \(R \rhd_{\beta} S\).</p>

<p>
(The proof of this theorem is quite non-trivial and is well-beyond the
scope of this entry.) The result is a deep fact about
\(\beta\)-reduction. It says that no matter how we diverge from \(P\)
by \(\beta\)-reductions, we can always converge again to a common
term.</p>

<p>
The Church-Rosser theorem gives us, among other things, that the plain
\(\lambda\)-calculus&mdash;that is, the theory <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong> of
equations between \(\lambda\)-terms&mdash;is consistent, in the sense
that not all equations are derivable.</p>

<p>
As an illustration, we can use the Church-Rosser theorem to solve the
earlier problem of showing that the two terms \(\bK\) and \(\mathbf{I}\)
are not identified by <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>. The two terms are in
\(\beta\)-normal form, so from them there are no \(\beta\)-reduction
sequences at all. If \(\bK = \mathbf{I}\) were a theorem of
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>, then there would be a term \(M\) from which there
is a \(\beta\)-reduction path to both \(\mathbf{I}\) and \(\bK\). The
Church-Rosser theorem then implies the two paths diverging from
\(M\) can be merged. But this is impossible, since \(\bK\) and
\(\mathbf{I}\) are distinct \(\beta\)-normal forms.</p>

<p>
The Church-Rosser theorem implies the existence of \(\beta\)-reduction
sequences commencing from \(\bK\) and from \(\mathbf{I}\) that end at a
common term. But there are no \(\beta\)-reduction sequences at all
commencing from \(\mathbf{I}\), because it is in \(\beta\)-normal form, and
likewise for \(\bK\).</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem</strong> <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong> is consistent, in the sense
that not every equation is a theorem.</p>

<p>
To prove the theorem, it is sufficient to produce one underivable
equation. We have already worked through an example: we used the
Church-Rosser theorem to show that the equation
\(\bK = \mathbf{I}\) is not a theorem of <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>. Of
course, there&rsquo;s nothing special about these two terms. A significant
generalization of this result is available: <em>if \(M\) and
\(N\) in \(\beta\)-normal form but \(M\) is distinct from \(N\),
then the equation \(M = N\) is not a theorem of
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong></em>. (This simple condition for underivability does
not generally hold if we add additional rules of inference to
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>.) </p>

<p>
The theories <strong>\(\lambda \eta\)</strong> and <strong>\(\lambda \omega\)</strong> are
likewise consistent. One can prove these consistency results along the
lines of the consistency proof for <strong>\(\lambda\)</strong> by extending the
Church-Rosser theorem to the wider senses of derivability of these
theories.</p>

<h2><a name="SemLCal">7. Semantics of \(\lambda\)-calculus</a></h2>

<p>
Although the \(\lambda\)-calculus is &lsquo;about&rsquo; calculating with
functions by substituting values for arguments, this simple point of
view cannot support a semantics for the (untyped) \(\lambda\)-calculus if
by &lsquo;function&rsquo; we understand, as is standard in set theory,
a relation \(R\) such that for every pair \((x,y)\) and
\((x,z)\) in \(R\) with the same first component \(x\)
we have \(y = z\). For sets \(X\) and \(Y\), let
\(X^Y\) denote the set of functions whose domain
is \(Y\) and with values in \(X\). Intuitively, if \(X\) is
the domain of an interpretation of \(\lambda\)-calculus, then \(X\)
should be, in some sense, isomorphic to \(X^X\)
because the domain should be closed under abstraction (as well as
application). Taken literally, though, this isomorphism is impossible,
because the cardinality of \(X\) always is of strictly smaller than
the cardinality of \(X^X\).</p>

<p>
If one is interested in simply the <em>existence</em> of some kind of
model of the \(\lambda\)-calculus&mdash;one whose domain not necessarily
consist of functions&mdash;one can find them by various well-known
&lsquo;syntactic&rsquo; constructions involving the theory
<strong>\(\lambda\)</strong>, not unlike the well-known Henkin constructions .
These so-called term models, though, are an unsatisfactory solution to
the question of whether there are &lsquo;mathematical&rsquo; models of
the \(\lambda\)-calculus.</p>

<p>
The cardinality argument shows that if we are to have a semantics for
\(\lambda\)-calculus, the interpretation of \(\lambda\)-terms cannot simply
be functions in the set-theoretic sense of the term. There are,
however, interpretations of \(\lambda\)-calculus. The first model,
\(D_{\infty}\), was found by D.&nbsp;Scott; other models
were found later. These models solve the cardinality problem by
restricting the domain \(X\) of interpretation, so that, in them,
\(X\) is in a suitable sense isomorphic to the &lsquo;function
space&rsquo; \(X^X\).</p>

<p>
One of the advantages of having different interpretations is that one
sees different aspects of equality: each of these models takes a
different view on what \(\lambda\)-terms get identified. The definitions
of \(D_{\infty}\) and other interpretations, the
verifications that they are indeed models of \(\lambda\)-calculus, and
the characterizations of the \(\lambda\)-theories of these models, are
beyond the scope of this entry; see (Barendregt, 1985, chapter 18) or
(Meyer 1982) for details. In recent years, there is a renewed interest
in the models of \(\lambda\)-calculus from the perspective of category
theory and categorical logic, focusing mainly on typed
\(\lambda\)-calculus (see sections
 <a href="#AddTyp">8.2</a>
 and
 <a href="#TypedLambda">9.1.2</a>
 below) but also dealing with category theoretic models of the untyped
\(\lambda\)-calculus discussed in this article. See, for example,
(Hyland, 2017) for details.</p>

<h2><a name="ExtVar">8. Extensions and Variations</a></h2>

A sister formalism of the \(\lambda\)-calculus, developed slightly
earlier, deals with variable-free combinations. <strong><em>Combinatory
logic</em></strong> is indeed even simpler than the \(\lambda\)-calculus, since
it lacks a notion of variable binding.</p>

<p>
The language of combinatory logic is built up from
<strong><em>combinators</em></strong> and variables. There is some flexibility in
precisely which combinators are chosen as basic, but some standard
ones are \(\mathbf{I}, \bK , \bS, \mathbf{B}\) and \(\mathbf{C}\). (The
names are not arbitrary.)</p>

<p>
As with the \(\lambda\)-calculus, with combinatory logic one is
interested in <em>reducibility</em> and <em>provability</em>. The
principal reduction relations are:</p>


<table class="cellpad-small-dense centered">
<tr>
<td>Combinator</td>
<td>Reduction Axiom</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td>\(\bI\)</td>
 <td>\(\bI x = x\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>\(\bK\)</td>
 <td>\(\bK xy = x\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>\(\bS\)</td>
 <td>\(\bS xyz = xz(yz)\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>\(\bB\)</td>
 <td>\(\bB xyz = x(yz)\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>\(\bC\)</td>
 <td>\(\bC xyz = xzy\)</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
There is a passage from \(\lambda\)-calculus to combinatory logic via
translation. It turns out that although combinatory logic lacks a
notion of abstraction, one can define such a notion and thereby
simulate the \(\lambda\)-calculus in combinatory logic. Here is one
translation; it is defined recursively.</p>

<table class="cellpad-small-dense centered">
<tr>
<td>Rule</td>
<td>Expression</td>
<td>Translation</td>
<td>Condition</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>1</td>
 <td>\(x\)</td>
 <td>\(x\)</td>

 <td>M</td>
 <td>\(x\) does not occur freely in M</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>6</td>
 <td>\(\lambda x[MN]\)</td>
 <td>\(\bB M(\lambda x[N)]^*\)</td>
 <td>\(x\) does not occur freely in M</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>7</td>
 <td>\(\lambda x[MN]\)</td>

 <td>\(\lambda x[MN]\)</td>
 <td>\(\bS M^*N^*\)</td>
 <td>\(x\) occurs freely in both \(M\) and \(N\)</td> </tr>

<p>
This translation works inside-out, rather than outside-in. To
illustrate:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
The translation of the term \(\lambda y[y]\), a
representative of the identity function, is mapped by this translation
to the identity combinator \(\bI\) (because of Rule 4), as
expected.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-term \(\lambda x[\lambda y[x]]\) that we
have been calling &lsquo;\(\bK\)&rsquo;is mapped by this translation
to:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\lambda x[\lambda y[x]] 
  &amp;\equiv \lambda x[\bK x]  &amp;\langle \text{Rule 1}\rangle \\
  &amp;\equiv \bK   &amp;\langle \text{Rule 3} \rangle
\end{align}\]
</li>

<li>
<p>
The \(\lambda\)-term \(\lambda x[\lambda y[yx]]\)
that switches its two arguments is mapped by this translation to:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\lambda x[\lambda y[yx]] 
 &amp;\equiv \lambda x[\bC(\lambda y[y])^* x]  &amp;\langle\text{Rule 8}\rangle \\
 &amp;\equiv \lambda x[\bC\bI x]  &amp;\langle\lambda y[y] \equiv \bI,\text{ by Rule 4}\rangle \\
 &amp;\equiv \bB\bC\bI)(\lambda x[x])^*  &amp;\langle\text{Rule 7}\rangle \\
 &amp;\equiv \bB(\bC\bI)\bI  &amp;\langle(\lambda x[x])^* \equiv \bI,\text{ by Rule 4}\rangle
\end{align}\]

<p>
We can confirm that the \(\lambda\)-term \(\lambda x[\lambda y[yx]]\)
and the translated combinatory logic term \(\bB(\bC\bI)\bI\) have
analogous applicative behavior: for all \(\lambda\)-terms \(P\) and
\(Q\) we have</p>

\[
(\lambda x[\lambda y[yx]])PQ \rhd (\lambda y[yP]) \rhd QP;
\]

<p>
likewise, for all combinatory logic terms \(P\) and \(Q\) we
have</p>

\[
\bB(\bC\bI)\bI PQ \rhd (\bC\bI)(\bI P)Q \rhd \bI Q(\bI P) \rhd Q(\bI P) \rhd QP
\]
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We can give but a glimpse of combinatory logic; for more on the
subject, consult the entry on
 <a href="../logic-combinatory/index.html">combinatory logic</a>.
 Many of the issues discussed here for \(\lambda\)-calculus have
analogues in combinatory logic, and vice versa.</p>

<h3><a name="AddTyp">8.2 Adding types</a></h3>

<p>
In many contexts of reasoning and computing it is natural to
distinguish between different kinds of objects. The way this
distinction is introduced is by requiring that certain formulas,
functions, or relations accept arguments or permit substitution only
of some kinds of objects rather than others. We might require, for
example, that addition + take numbers as arguments. The effect of this
restriction is to forbid, say, the addition of 5 and the identity
function
 \(\lambda x.x\).(<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>).
 Regimenting objects into types is also the idea behind the passage
from (unsorted, or one-sorted) first-order logic to
<em>many-sorted</em> first-order logic. (See (Enderton, 2001) and
(Manzano, 2005) for more about many-sorted first-order logic.) As it
stands, the \(\lambda\)-calculus does not support this kind of
discrimination; any term can be applied to any other term.</p>

<p>
It is straightforward to extend the untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus so that
it discriminates between different kinds of objects. This entry limits
itself to the <em>type-free</em> \(\lambda\)-calculus. See the entries on
 <a href="../type-theory/index.html">type theory</a>
 and
 <a href="../type-theory-church/index.html">Church&rsquo;s type theory</a>
 for a detailed discussion of the extensions of \(\lambda\)-calculus that
we get when we add types, and see (Barendregt, Dekkers, Statman, 2013)
for a book length treatment of the subject.</p>

<h2><a name="App">9. Applications</a></h2>

<h3><a name="LogLaL">9.1 Logic &agrave; la \(\lambda\)</a></h3>

<p>
Here are two senses in which \(\lambda\)-calculus is connected with
logic.</p>

<h4>9.1.1 Terms as logical constants</h4>

<p>
In the
 <a href="#combinator-table">table of combinators</a>
 above, we defined combinators \(\bT\) and \(\bF\) and said that
they serve as representations in the \(\lambda\)-calculus of the truth
values true and false, respectively. How do these terms function as
truth values?</p>

<p>
It turns out that when one is treating \(\lambda\)-calculus as a kind of
programming language, one can write conditional statements &ldquo;If
\(P\) then \(A\) else \(B\)&rdquo; simply as
\(PAB\), where of course \(P, A\), and
\(B\) are understood as \(\lambda\)-terms. If \(P \rhd \bT\), that is, P is &lsquo;true&rsquo;, then we have</p>

\[
\text{if-}P\text{-then-}A\text{-else-}B := PAB \rhd \bT AB \rhd A,
\]

<p>
(recall that, by definition, \(\bT \equiv \bK\)) and if 
\(P \rhd \bF\), that is, \(P\) is &lsquo;false&rsquo;, then</p>


\[
\text{if-}P\text{-then-}A\text{-else-}B := PAB \rhd \bF AB \rhd B,
\]

<p>
(recall that, by definition, \(\mathbf{F} \equiv \mathbf{KI})\) which
is just what we expect from a notion of if-then-else. If \(P\) reduces
neither to \(\mathbf{T}\) nor \(\mathbf{F}\), then we cannot in
general say what \(\text{if-}P\text{-then-}A\text{-else-}B\) is.
</p>

<p>
The encoding we&rsquo;ve just sketched of some of the familiar truth values
and logical connectives of classical truth-table logic does not show
that \(\lambda\)-calculus and classical logic are intimately related. The
encoding shows little more than embeddibility of the rules of
computation of classical truth-table logic in \(\lambda\)-calculus.
Logics other than classical truth-table logic can likewise be
represented in the \(\lambda\)-calculus, if one has sufficient computable
ingredients for the logic in question (e.g., if the logical
consequence relation is computable, or if a derivability relation is
computable, etc.). For more on computing with \(\lambda\)-calculus, see
section
 <a href="#Computing">9.2</a>
 below. A more intrinsic relationship between logic and
\(\lambda\)-calculus is discussed in the next section.</p>

<h4><a name="TypedLambda">9.1.2 Typed \(\lambda\)-calculus and the Curry-Howard-de Bruijn correspondence</a></h4>

<p>
The correspondence to be descried here between logic and the
\(\lambda\)-calculus is seen with the help of an apparatus known as
<em>types</em>. This section sketches the beginnings of the
development of the subject known as <strong><em>type theory</em></strong>. We are
interested in developing type theory only so far as to make the
so-called Curry-Howard-de Bruijn correspondence visible. A more
detailed treatment can be found in the entry on
 <a href="../type-theory/index.html">type theory</a>;
 see also (Hindley, 1997) and (Barendregt, Dekkers, Statman,
2013).</p>

<p>
Type theory enriches the untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus by requiring that
terms be given <strong><em>types</em></strong>. In the untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus,
the application \(MN\) is a legal term regardless of what
\(M\) and \(N\) are. Such freedom permits one to form such
suspicious terms as \(xx\), and thence terms such as the
paradoxical combinator \(\mathbf{Y}\). One might wish to exclude terms like
\(xx\) on the grounds that \(x\) is serving both as a
function (on the left-hand side of the application) and as an argument
(on the right-hand side of the application). Type theory gives us the
resources for making this intuitive argument more precise.</p>

<div class="indent">
<p>

<strong>Assigning types to terms</strong> The language of type theory
begins with an (infinite) set of <strong><em>type
variables</em></strong> (which is assumed to be disjoint from the set
of variables of the \(\lambda\)-calculus and from the symbol
&lsquo;\(\lambda\)&rsquo; itself).  The set of types is made up of
type variables and the operation \(\sigma \rightarrow
\tau\). Variables in type theory now come with a
<strong><em>type annotation</em></strong> (unlike the unadorned term
variables of untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus). Typed variables are
rendered &lsquo;\(x : \sigma\)&rsquo;; the intuitive reading is
&lsquo;the variable \(x\) has the type \(\sigma\)&rsquo;. The
intuitive reading of the judgment &lsquo;\(t : \sigma \rightarrow
\tau\)&rsquo; is that the term \(t\) is a function that transforms
arguments of type \(\sigma\) into arguments of type \(\tau\). Given an
assignment of types to term variables, one has the typing rules:</p>

\[
(M : \sigma \rightarrow \tau)(N : \sigma) : \tau
\]

<p>
and</p>

\[
(\lambda x : \sigma[M : \tau]) : \sigma \rightarrow \tau
\]

<p>
The above two rules define the assignment of types to applications and
to abstraction terms. The set of terms of type theory is the set of
terms built up according to these formation rules.</p>
</div>

<p>
The above definition of the set of terms of type theory is sufficient
to rule out terms such as \(xx\). Of course, &lsquo;\(xx\)&rsquo; is
not a typed term at all for the simple reason that no types have been
assigned to it. What is meant is that there is no type \(\sigma\) that
could be assigned to \(x\) such that &lsquo;\(xx\)&rsquo; could be
annotated in a legal way to make a typed term. We cannot assign to
\(x\) a type variable, because then the type of the left-hand \(x\)
would fail to be a function type (i.e., a type of the shape
&lsquo;\(\sigma \rightarrow \tau\)&rsquo;). Moreover, we cannot assign
to \(x\) a function type \(\sigma \rightarrow \tau\), because then
then \(\sigma\) would be equal to \(\sigma \rightarrow \tau\), which
is impossible.</p>

<p>
As a leading example, consider the types that are assigned to the
combinators \(\bI\), \(\bK\), and \(\bS\):</p>

<table class="cellpad-small-dense centered">
<tr>
<td>Combinator&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>Type<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></td>
</tr>
<tr>
 <td>\(\bI\)</td>
 <td>\(a \rightarrow a\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>\(\bK\)</td>
 <td>\(a \rightarrow(b \rightarrow a)\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>\(\bS\)</td>
 <td>\( (a \rightarrow(b \rightarrow c)) \rightarrow 
  ((a \rightarrow b) \rightarrow(a \rightarrow c))\)</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
(See Hindley (1997) <em>Table of principal types</em> for a more
extensive listing.) If we read &lsquo;\(\rightarrow\)&rsquo; as implication and
type variables as propositional variables, then we recognize three
familiar tautologies in the right-hand column of the table. The
language used is meager: there are only propositional variables and
implication; there are no other connectives.</p>

<p>
The table suggests an interesting correspondence between the typed
\(\lambda\)-calculus and formal logic. Could it really be that the
types assigned to formulas, when understood as logical formulas, are
valid? Yes, though &lsquo;validity&rsquo; needs to understood not as
classical validity:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem</strong> If \(\tau\) is the type of some \(\lambda\)-term,
then \(\tau\) is intuitionistically valid.</p>

<p>
The converse of this theorem holds as well:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem</strong> If \(\phi\) is an intuitionistically valid
logical formula whose only connective is implication \((\rightarrow)\), then
\(\phi\) is the type of some \(\lambda\)-term.</p>

<p>
The correspondence can be seen when one identifies intuitionistic
validity with derivability in a certain natural deduction formalism.
For a proof of these two theorems, see (Hindley, 1997, chapter 6).</p>

<p>
The correspondence expressed by the previous two theorems between
intuitionistic validity and typability is known as the
<em>Curry-Howard-de Bruijn</em> correspondence, after three logicians
who noticed it independently. The correspondence, as stated, is
between only propositional intuitionistic logic, restricted to the
fragment containing only the implication connective \(\rightarrow\). One can
extend the correspondence to other connectives and to quantifiers,
too, but the most crisp correspondence is at the level of the
implication-only fragment. For details, see (Howard, 1980).</p>

<h3><a name="Computing">9.2 Computing</a></h3>

<p>
One can represent natural numbers in a simple way, as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Definition</strong> (ordered tuples, natural numbers) The
ordered tuple \(\langle a_0,\ldots a_n\rangle\) of \(\lambda\)-terms
is defined as \(\lambda x[x a_0\ldots a_n]\).  One then defines the
\(\lambda\)-term \(\ulcorner n\urcorner\) corresponding to the natural
number \(n\) as: \(\ulcorner 0\urcorner = \mathbf{I}\) and, for every
\(k\), \(\ulcorner k + 1\urcorner = \langle \mathbf{F}, \ulcorner
k\urcorner\rangle\).</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-term corresponding to the number 1, on this
representation, is:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\ulcorner 1 \urcorner &amp;\equiv \langle\bF,\ulcorner 0\urcorner\rangle \\
  &amp;\equiv \langle\bF,\bI\rangle \\
  &amp;\equiv \lambda x[x\mathbf{FI}]
\end{align}\]
</li>

<li>

<p>
The \(\lambda\)-term corresponding to the number 2, on this
representation, is:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\ulcorner 2 \urcorner &amp;\equiv \langle\bF,\ulcorner 1\urcorner\rangle \\
  &amp;\equiv \lambda x[x\mathbf{F}\lambda x[x\mathbf{FI}]]
\end{align}\]
</li>

<li>

<p>
Similarly, \(\ulcorner 3\urcorner\) is
\(\lambda x[x\mathbf{F}\lambda x[x\mathbf{F}\lambda x[x\mathbf{FI}]]]\).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Various representations of natural numbers are available; this
representation is but
 one.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Using the ingredients provided by the \(\lambda\)-calculus, one can
represent all recursive functions. This shows that the model is
exactly as expressive as other models of computing, such as Turing
machines and register machines. Priority goes to Turing&rsquo;s definition
of his machine, but Church&rsquo;s proposal of the \(\lambda\)-calculus was
developed at almost exactly the same time.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Theorem</strong> For every recursive function \(f\) of
arity \(n\), there exists a \(\lambda\)-term \(f^*\) such
that</p>

 <div class="indent">
 <p>for all natural numbers \(a_1,\ldots a_n\):
 \(f(a_1,\ldots a_n) = y\) iff
 \(\boldsymbol{\lambda} \vdash f^*\langle \bar{a}_1,\ldots,\bar{a}_n\rangle = \bar{y}\)
 </div>
</div>

<p>
For a proof, see
 <a href="recursive-functions.html">the appendix</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Since the class of recursive functions is an adequate representation
of the class of all computable (number-theoretic) functions, thanks to
the work above we find that all computable (number-theoretic)
functions can be faithfully represented in the \(\lambda\)-calculus.</p>

<h3><a name="Relations">9.3 Relations</a></h3>

<p>
The motivation for the \(\lambda\)-calculus given at the beginning of the
entry was based on reading \(\lambda\)-expressions as descriptions of
functions. Thus, we have understood
&lsquo;\(\lambda x[M]\)&rsquo; to be a (or the) function
that, given \(x\), gives \(M\) (which generally, though not
necessarily, involves x). But it is not necessary to read
\(\lambda\)-terms as functions. One could understand \(\lambda\)-terms as
denoting relations, and read an abstraction term
&lsquo;\(\lambda x[M]\)&rsquo; as the unary relation (or
property) \(R\) that holds of an argument \(x\) just in case
\(M\) does (see Carnap 1947, p. 3). On the relational reading, we
can understand an application term \(MN\) as a form of
predication. One can make sense of these terms using the principle of
\(\beta\)-conversion:</p>

\[
(\lambda x[M])a = M[x := A],
\]

<p>
which says that the abstraction relation \(\lambda x[M]\),
predicated of A, is the relation obtained by plugging in A for all
free occurrences of \(x\) inside \(M\).</p>

<p>
As a concrete example of this kind of approach to \(\lambda\)-calculus,
consider an extension of first-order logic where one can form new
atomic formulas using \(\lambda\)-terms, in the following way:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Syntax</strong>: For any formula \(\phi\) and any finite sequence
\(x_1 , \ldots ,x_n\) of
variables, the expression
&lsquo;\(\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n [\phi]\)&rsquo;
is a predicate symbol of arity n. Extend the notion of free and bound
variables (using the functions \(\mathbf{FV}\) and \(\mathbf{BV})\) in such a way
that</p>

\[
\mathbf{FV}(\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n [\phi]) = \mathbf{FV}(\phi) - \{ x_1 , \ldots x_n \}
\]

<p>
and</p>

\[
\mathbf{BV}(\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n [\phi]) = \mathbf{BV}(\phi) \cup \{ x_1 , \ldots x_n \}
\]

<p>
<strong>Deduction</strong> Assume as axioms the universal closures of
all equivalences</p>

\[
\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n [\phi](t_1 ,\ldots t_n) \leftrightarrow \phi[x_1 ,\ldots x_n := t_1,\ldots t_n]
\]

<p>
where \(\phi[x_1 ,\ldots x_n := t_1,\ldots t_n]\) denotes the
simultaneous substitution of the terms \(t_k\) for
the variables \(x_k\) \((1 \le k \le n)\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Semantics</strong> For a first-order structure \(A\) and an
assignment \(s\) of elements of \(A\) to variables, define</p>

\[\begin{align}
A \vDash &amp;\lambda x_1 \ldots x_n [\phi](t_1 ,\ldots t_n) [s] \text{ iff } \\
         &amp;A \vDash \phi[x_1 ,\ldots x_n := t_1,\ldots t_n] [s]
\end{align}\]
</div>

<p>
According to this approach, one can use a \(\lambda\) to treat
essentially any formula, even complex ones, as if they were atomic. We
see the principle of \(\beta\)-reduction in the deductive and semantic
parts. That this approach adheres to the relational reading of
\(\lambda\) terms can be seen clearly in the semantics: according to the
standard Tarski-style semantics for first-order logic, the
interpretation of a formula (possibly with free variables) denotes a
set of tuples of elements of the structure, as we vary the variable
assignment that assigns elements of the structure to the
variables.</p>

<p>
One can &lsquo;internalize&rsquo; this functional approach. This is
done in the case of various <em>property theories</em>, formal
theories for reasoning about properties as metaphysical objects
(Bealer 1982, Zalta 1983, Menzel 1986, 1993, and Turner 1987). This
kind of theory is employed in certain metaphysical investigations
where properties are metaphysical entities to be investigated. In
these theories, metaphysical relations are (or are among) the objects
of interest; just as we add term-building symbols + and \(\times\) in
formal theories of arithmetic to build numbers, \(\lambda\) is used in
property theory to build relations. This approach contrasts with the
approach above. There, \(\lambda\) was added to the grammar of
first-order logic by making it a recipe for building atomic formulas;
it was a new formula-building operator, like \(\vee\) or \(\rightarrow\) or the
other connectives. In the case of property theories, the \(\lambda\)
plays a role more like + and \(\times\) in formal theories of arithmetic:
it is used to construct relations (which, in this setting, are to be
understood as a kind of metaphysical object). Unlike + and \(\times\),
though, the \(\lambda\) binds variables.</p>

<p>
To give an illustration of how \(\lambda\) is used in this setting,
let us inspect the grammar of a typical application (McMichael and
Zalta, 1980). One typically has a <em>predication operator</em> (or,
more precisely, a family of predication operators) \(p_k (k \ge
0)\). In a language where we have terms \(\mary\) and \(\john\) and a
binary relation loves, we can formally express:</p>

<ul>

<li>John loves Mary: \(\loves(\john ,\mary)\)</li>

<li>The property that John loves Mary: \(\lambda[\loves(\john ,\mary)]\)
(note that the \(\lambda\) is binding no variables; we might call this
&lsquo;vacuous binding&rsquo;. Such properties can be understood as
propositions.)</li>

<li>The property of an object \(x\) that John loves it:
\(\lambda x [\loves(\john,x)]\).</li>

<li>The property that Mary is loved by something:
\(\lambda[\exists x(\loves(x,\mary))]\)
(another instance of vacuous binding,
viz., proposition)</li>

<li>The predication of the property of \(x\) that John loves
\(x\) to Mary: \(p_1 (\lambda x[\loves(\john,x)],\mary)\).</li>

<li>The (0-ary) predication of the property that John loves Mary:
\(p_0 (\lambda x[\loves(\john,\mary)])\).</li>

<li>The property of objects \(x\) and \(y\) that \(x\) loves
\(y\): \(\lambda xy[\loves(x,y)]\).</li>

<li>The property of an objects \(x\) that \(x\) loves itself:
\(\lambda x[\loves(x,x)]\).</li>

<li>The predication of the property of objects \(x\) and \(y\)
that \(x\) loves \(y\) to John and Mary (in that order):
\(p_2 (\lambda xy[\loves(x,y)],\john,\mary)\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
We reason with these \(\lambda\)-terms using a \(\beta\)-conversion
principle such as:</p>

\[\begin{align}
p_n (\lambda x_1,&amp;\ldots x_n [A], t_1 , \ldots ,t_n) \leftrightarrow \\
                 &amp;A[x_1 ,\ldots x_n := t_1,\ldots, t_n]
\end{align}\]

<p>
Formally, the predication operator p\(_k\) is a
\((k+1)\)-ary predicate symbol. The first argument is intended to
be a \(\lambda\)-term of \(k\) arguments, and the rest of the
arguments are intended to be the arguments of the body of the
\(\lambda\)-term. The \(\beta\)-principle above says that the predication of
an \(n\)-ary \(\lambda\)-term \(L\) to \(n\) terms holds
precisely when the body of \(L\) holds of those terms.</p>

<p>
It turns out that in these theories, we may or may not be able to be
fully committed to the principle of \(\beta\)-conversion. Indeed, in some
property theories, the full principle of \(\beta\)-conversion leads to
paradox, because one can replay a Russell-style argument when the full
principle of \(\beta\)-conversion is in place. In such settings, one
restricts the formation of \(\lambda\)-formulas by requiring that the
body of a \(\lambda\)-term not contain further \(\lambda\)-terms or
quantifiers. For further discussion, see (Orilia, 2000).</p>

<p>
One of the reasons why property theories formulated in the
\(\lambda\)-calculus are of a particular philosophical importance is the
<em>hyperintensional</em> nature of the calculus (see section
 <a href="#Non-Extensionality">1.2</a>).
 A property concept may be called
&lsquo;<em>hyperintensional</em>&rsquo; if and only if it does not
identify necessarily coextensional properties, i.e. properties that
are instanciated by exactly the same objects at every possible world.
The properties and relations described by the theories of Bealer,
Zalta, Menzel, and Turner have exactly this characteristic. In other
words, the theories are hyperintensional property theories. Recent
years have seen a significant rise of interest in hyperintensional
concepts of properties in metaphysics (Nolan 2014), and
correspondingly property theories formulated in the \(\lambda\)-calculus
will likely experience a rise of interest as well.</p>

<p>
In the context of the foundations of mathematics, Zalta and
Oppenheimer (2011) argue for the conceptual priority of the relational
interpretation of \(\lambda\)-terms over the functional one. </p>

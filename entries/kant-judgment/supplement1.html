<h2>The Togetherness Principle, Kant&rsquo;s Conceptualism, and Kant&rsquo;s Non-Conceptualism</h2>

<p>
One of the best-known and most widely-quoted texts of the <em>Critique
of Pure Reason</em> is this pithy slogan: &ldquo;thoughts without
content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind&rdquo;
(A51/B76). That slogan encapsulates what can be called <em>the
togetherness principle</em>. The &ldquo;togetherness&rdquo; here is
the necessary cognitive complementarity and semantic interdependence
of intuitions and concepts, when placed against the backdrop of
Kant&rsquo;s cognitive dualism of the faculties of sensibility and
understanding:</p>

<blockquote>
Intuition and concepts &hellip; constitute the elements of all our
cognition, so that neither concepts without intuition corresponding to
them in some way nor intuition without concepts can yield a cognition.
Thoughts without [intensional] content (<em>Inhalt</em>) are empty
(<em>leer</em>), intuitions without concepts are blind
(<em>blind</em>). It is, therefore, just as necessary to make the
mind&rsquo;s concepts sensible&mdash;that is, to add an object to them
in intuition&mdash;as to make our intuitions understandable&mdash;that
is, to bring them under concepts. These two powers, or capacities,
cannot exchange their functions. The understanding can intuit nothing,
the senses can think nothing. Only from their unification can
cognition arise. (A50&ndash;51/B74&ndash;76)
</blockquote>

<p>
What does the togetherness principle mean? The famous texts just
quoted have led many readers and interpreters of Kant&mdash;e.g.,
Sellars 1963, Sellars 1968, McDowell 1994, and Abela 2002&mdash;to
deny the cognitive and semantic independence of intuitions: intuitions
without concepts either simply do not exist or else are wholly
meaningless (i.e., neither objectively valid nor rationally
intelligible) even if they do exist. And this denial appears to be
supported by at least one other text:</p>

<blockquote>
The understanding cognizes everything only through concepts;
consequently, however far it goes in its divisions [of lower concepts]
it never cognizes through mere intuition but always yet again through
lower concepts. (A656/B684).
</blockquote>

<p>
But even so, this cannot be a correct interpretation of the famous
texts at A50&ndash;51/B74&ndash;76, because of what Kant says in these
texts:</p>

<blockquote>
Objects can indeed appear to us <em>without necessarily having to be
related to functions of the understanding</em>. (A89/B122, emphasis
added)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Appearances can certainly be given in intuition <em>without functions
of the understanding</em>. (A90/B122, emphasis added)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Appearances might very well be so constituted that the understanding
would not find them in accordance with the conditions of its
unity&hellip;. [and] in the series of appearances nothing would
present itself that would yield a rule of synthesis and so correspond
to the concept of cause and effect, so that this concept would be
entirely empty, null, and meaningless. <em>Appearances would none the
less present objects to our intuition, since intuition by no means
requires the functions of thought</em>. (A90&ndash;91/B122&ndash;123,
emphasis added)
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The manifold for intuition must already be given <em>prior to the
synthesis of the understanding and independently from it</em>. (B145,
emphasis added)
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, according to these last four texts, intuitions are
<em>essentially non-conceptual</em> <em>cognitions</em>, that is,
rational human cognitions that exist and are objectively valid both
over and above concepts and also without requiring concepts. Let us
call the thesis that intuitions are sufficient for the production of
objectively valid cognitions, over and above any conceptual contents
(whether empirical or non-empirical) that might be associated with
those intuitions, the <em>independence</em> of intuitions from
concepts. Since Kant is also committed to the really possible and
actual existence of non-rational human or non-human animal
cognizers&mdash;&ldquo;babes and beasts&rdquo;&mdash;that do not
possess a faculty of understanding, hence lack conceptual capacities,
yet are also capable of generating objectively valid empirical and
pure intuitions (McLear 2011), then intuitional/essentially
non-conceptual cognitions can also exist and be objectively valid
<em>autonomously</em>, that is, in the total absence of concepts and
conceptual capacities alike. So Kant is committed to the togetherness
principle and also to the independence and autonomy of intuitions. But
now we are in a dilemma. How then can these two apparently
contradictory sets of texts be reconciled?</p>

<p>
The answer is that what Kant is actually saying in the famous texts at
A50&ndash;51/B74&ndash;76 is that intuitions and concepts are
cognitively complementary and semantically interdependent <em>for the
specific purpose of constituting objectively valid judgments</em>.
This in turn corresponds directly to a special, narrower sense of
&lsquo;cognition&rsquo; that Kant highlights in the B edition of the
first <em>Critique</em>, which means the same as <em>objectively valid
judgment</em> (B xxvi, Bxxvi n.), as opposed to the wider definition
of &lsquo;cognition&rsquo; that he had used in the A edition, which
means the same as <em>conscious objective representation</em>
(A320/B376&ndash;377). But from this it does not follow that there
cannot be &ldquo;empty&rdquo; concepts or &ldquo;blind&rdquo;
intuitions outside the special context of objectively valid judgments.
&lsquo;Empty concept&rsquo; for Kant does not mean either &ldquo;bogus
concept&rdquo; or &ldquo;wholly meaningless concept&rdquo;: rather it
means &ldquo;concept that is not objectively valid,&rdquo; and as we
have seen in
 <a href="index-2.html#JudObjValObjReaTru">Section 1.3</a>,
 for Kant there can be very different sorts of concepts that are not
objectively valid, including rationally intelligible concepts of
noumenal objects or noumenal subjects. So too, when Kant says that
&ldquo;the understanding can make no use (<em>Gebrauch</em>) of ...
concepts than to judge by means of them&rdquo; (A68/B93), he is not
saying, in anticipation of Frege&rsquo;s context principle (i.e., that
words have meaning only in the context of whole propositions) that
concepts are meaningful only in the context of objectively valid
judgments, or meaningful only in the context of <em>any</em> kind of
judgment, since noumenal concepts, quite apart from any kind of
judgment, are obvious counterexamples. Similarly, &lsquo;blind
intuition&rsquo; for Kant does not mean either &ldquo;bogus
intuition&rdquo; or &ldquo;wholly meaningless intuition&rdquo;: rather
it means &ldquo;autonomously and independently objectively valid
intuition/essentially non-conceptual cognition.&rdquo; Therefore,
despite its being true for Kant, according to the togetherness
principle, that intuitions and concepts must be combined with one
another in order to generate objectively valid judgments, nevertheless
intuitions/essentially non-conceptual cognitions can also occur both
autonomously from and independently of concepts and still remain
objectively valid. And in particular, to the extent that intuitions
are cognitively and semantically autonomous from and independent of
concepts, and also objectively valid, they contain <em>essentially
non-conceptual conscious objective representational contents</em>.</p>

<p>
But the very idea that according to Kant, in rational human cognition
and in non-rational human or non-human cognition alike there exist
conscious objectively representational <em>intuitions</em> that are
essentially autonomous from and independent of <em>concepts</em>, has
generated a vigorous debate in recent and contemporary
Kant-interpretation, with far-reaching implications for interpreting
Kant&rsquo;s theory of judgment, his transcendental idealism, and the
Transcendental Deduction of the Pure Concepts or Categories. This is
the debate about Kant&rsquo;s conceptualism vs. Kant&rsquo;s
non-conceptualism.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, even quite apart from their Kantian incarnations,
conceptualism and non-conceptualism are defined in non-trivially
different ways by different contemporary philosophers of mind (see,
e.g., Berm&uacute;dez &amp; Cahen 2015, Van Cleve 2012). But for the
present purposes of discussion, conceptualism is the two-part thesis
(C1) that all rational human conscious objective representational
content is strictly determined by conceptual capacities alone, and
(C2) that non-rational human or non-human animals are not capable of
conscious objective representation. By contrast, non-conceptualism is
the three-part thesis (NC1) that not all rational human conscious
objective representational content is determined by conceptual
capacities alone, (NC2) that at least some rational human conscious
objective representational contents are both autonomous from and
independent of conceptual content and also strictly determined by
non-conceptual capacities alone, and (NC3) that at least some and
perhaps most non-rational human or non-human animals are capable of
conscious objective representation.</p>

<p>
Kant&rsquo;s conceptualism, in turn, is taken to follow directly from
the togetherness principle; and, in addition to asserting both (C1)
and (C2), it adds either (KC1) that the rational human understanding
and its innate conceptual capacities not only strictly determine all
conscious objective representational content, especially including all
objectively valid judgments, but also strictly determine the faculty
of sensibility itself and all the intuitions yielded by it (<em>strong
Kantian conceptualism</em>) (see, e.g., Sellars 1963, Sellars 1968,
McDowell 1994, Abela 2002), or else (KC2) that the rational human
understanding and its innate conceptual capacities strictly determine
all conscious objective representational content, especially including
all objectively valid judgments, as well as all intuitions, although
the faculty of sensibility independently provides a necessary
condition for conscious objective representation, and some empirical
concepts or conceptual activities occur outside the context of fully
explicit judgments or self-consciously articulated propositions
(<em>weak Kantian conceptualism</em>) (see, e.g., Wenzel 2005,
Ginsborg 2006, Ginsborg 2008, McDowell 2009, Bowman 2011, Gr&uuml;ne
2009, Griffith 2012, Land 2011, Bauer 2012, Golob 2012, Williams 2012,
McDowell 2013, Pippin 2013, McLear 2014, Land 2016, Soboleva
forthcoming, Golob forthcoming). The most important difference between
strong Kantian conceptualism and weak Kantian conceptualism is that
whereas the weak variety at least minimally preserves Kant&rsquo;s
cognitive dualism of faculties, and also some sort of semi-independent
<em>cognitive role</em> for intuitions (even though it still rejects
the thesis that intuitions have an essentially different kind of
<em>representational content</em> from concepts), the strong variety
does <em>not</em> countenance any of these concessions to
non-conceptualism, and thereby, in effect, strong Kantian
conceptualism explanatorily reduces the faculty of sensibility to the
faculty of understanding.</p>

<p>
In any case, by contrast to either weak or strong Kantian
conceptualism, Kant&rsquo;s non-conceptualism is taken to follow from
the four texts cited above; and in addition to asserting (NC1), (NC2),
and (NC3), it also adds either (KNC1) that the rational human capacity
for sensibility generates empirical intuitions and pure intuitions
that autonomously and independently provide conscious objective
representational contents (<em>weak Kantian non-conceptualism</em>)
(Rohs 2001, Hanna 2005, Allais 2009, Allais 2015, McLear 2015, Allais
2016), or else (KNC2) that the rational human capacity for sensibility
not only generates empirical intuitions and pure intuitions that
autonomously and independently provide conscious objective
representational contents, but <em>also</em>, by means of these
autonomous and independent non-conceptual cognitions, the faculty of
sensibility contributes directly to the justification of epistemic and
practical beliefs, by virtue of inherently normative and
proto-rational factors that it builds into the essentially
non-conceptual content of intuitions (<em>strong Kantian
non-conceptualism</em>) (Laiho 2012, Tolley 2013, Hanna 2015). The
most important difference between weak Kantian non-conceptualism and
strong Kantian non-conceptualism is that whereas the weak variety does
not directly address the classical Sellarsian worry, known as The Myth
of the Given, that nothing can count as conscious objective
representational content unless it occurs within the essentially
conceptual domain of &ldquo;the space of reasons&rdquo; (see, e.g.,
Sellars 1963, McDowell 1994, McDowell 2009), and only thereby can
contribute directly to the justification of epistemic and practical
beliefs, the strong version of Kantian non-conceptualism explicitly
asserts that autonomously and independently objectively valid
intuitions can contribute directly to the justification of epistemic
and practical beliefs <em>without</em> having to enter the essentially
conceptual domain of &ldquo;the space of reasons.&rdquo; Or in other
words, strong Kantian non-conceptualism explicitly deflects and trumps
The Myth of the Given.</p>

<p>
As several recent Kant-commentators have correctly noted, not only do
Kantian conceptualism and Kantian non-conceptualism stake out
strikingly different positions on how correctly to interpret
Kant&rsquo;s theory of cognition in general and his theory of judgment
in particular, they also define strikingly different ways of
interpreting the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> as a whole, but
especially the nature of transcendental idealism (Hanna 2016a) and the
Transcendental Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding or
Categories (Hanna 2011, Schulting 2012, Land 2015, Golob 2016, Hanna
2016b). In short, and to put it bluntly, what is at issue here is
nothing less than the entire Kantian Critical ball of wax (Onof 2016).
So which approach is correct?</p>

<p>
Currently, and perhaps not too surprisingly, the correct answer to
that question remains deeply controversial. As we have already seen,
the textual evidence pulls in both directions, and is not decisive.
What does seem very clear is that if there is to be a resolution to
the debate, or at any rate some further fruitful philosophical
progress in it, then this will almost certainly come from a fuller
appreciation and critical evaluation of how Kantian conceptualism and
Kantian non-conceptualism, whether in their strong or weak versions,
precisely and differentially affect interpretations of Kant&rsquo;s
theory of judgment, and by means of that, interpretations of
Kant&rsquo;s transcendental idealism and the Transcendental Deduction
of the Categories. This is spelled out in some detail in Sections 3
and 4. But in the meantime and in anticipation of those details, it is
worth noting that two fundamental problems, both centered on judgment,
are put in play by the Kantian conceptualism vs. non-conceptualism
debate. </p>

<p>
The first fundamental problem is what can be called <em>the
schmimagination vicious regress problem</em> (see. e.g., Schulting
2012), and it says this. If the faculty of imagination is supposed by
Kant to mediate between and also unify the dual faculties of
understanding and sensibility for the purpose of forming objectively
valid judgments, yet the imagination&mdash;and along with it,
synthesis, spontaneity, and the objective unity of representational
content&mdash;all correspondingly split into two essentially different
kinds, one kind inherently associated with understanding and the other
kind inherently associated with sensibility, then yet <em>another</em>
fourth kind of faculty, as it were, <em>schmimagination</em>, is now
needed to mediate between and unify the two kinds of imagination,
synthesis, spontaneity, and objective unity of representational
content, etc., ad infinitum. But this leads to a vicious explanatory
regress. If, in order to avoid this explanatory regress, one adopts
strong Kantian conceptualism, which reduces the sensibility to the
understanding, then that undermines Kant&rsquo;s cognitive dualism of
faculties, and with it, the basis of Kant&rsquo;s claim to be offering
a genuine philosophical advance over Rationalism and Empiricism, not
to mention (looking beyond Kant into the 19th century) a genuine
philosophical competitor to Hegel&rsquo;s absolute idealism (Hanna
2012, Gardner 2013, Hanna 2013). So either one is stuck with a vicious
explanatory regress or else one gives up Kant&rsquo;s claim to
philosophical originality.</p>

<p>
The second fundamental problem is what can be called <em>the TD modus
ponens/modus tollens dilemma</em> (see, e.g., Gr&uuml;ne 2011), and it
says this. The Kantian non-conceptualist argues that (1) if Kantian
non-conceptualism is true, then autonomously and independently
objective valid intuitions exist, (2) if autonomously and
independently objective valid intuitions exist, then there is a
serious gap in the Transcendental Deduction of the Categories (The
TD), in the sense that the cognitive scope of the sensibility thereby
actually exceeds, or at the very least threatens to exceed, the
cognitive scope of the understanding and its pure concepts, and (3) if
there is a serious gap in The TD, then The TD is unsound, and finally
(4) therefore, The TD is unsound. But the Kantian conceptualist argues
that (1) The TD must be sound, (2) if The TD is sound, then there is
no serious gap in The TD, (3) if there is no serious gap in The TD,
then no autonomously and independently objectively valid intuitions
exist, (4) if no autonomously and independently objectively valid
intuitions exist, then Kantian non-conceptualism must be false, and
finally (5) therefore, Kantian non-conceptualism is false. In other
words, the Kantian non-conceptualist&rsquo;s modus ponens is the
Kantian conceptualist&rsquo;s modus tollens, and there appears to be
no principled way to resolve the dilemma.</p>

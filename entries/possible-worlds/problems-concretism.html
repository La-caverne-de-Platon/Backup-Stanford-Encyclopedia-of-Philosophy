<h2>Further Problems for Concretism</h2>

    <!--Note on Lewis's connections to Quine here?-->

    <h3>The Charge of Circularity</h3>

    <p>

Lycan (1988, 1991) and others have disputed the claim that Lewis's 
account is free of any modalities and hence have questioned whether 
it really provides an analysis of our modal intuitive notions. The 
usual charge is that 'world' for Lewis can only mean '<i>possible</i>
world', lest, e.g., there be Lewisian worlds containing impossible 
objects. It is not clear that this charge has any merit. If an 
astrophysicist were to conjecture for theoretical reasons the 
existence of a distant galaxy beyond the reach of any telescope, we 
would not say that by 'galaxy' the astrophysicist can only mean 
'<i>possible</i> galaxy'. We would say simply that the astrophysicist
is conjecturing that there is yet another thing of an already 
familiar sort, viz., galaxies. Modality need not enter the picture at
all. It seems that an analogous response is open to Lewis. He is 
simply conjecturing for theoretical reasons that there is yet another
thing &mdash; indeed <em>many</em> other things &mdash; of an already
familiar sort, viz., worlds and, on the face of it anyway, those 
entities are themselves analyzed in non-modal terms, viz., 
spatiotemporal relations and mereology. Granted, the picture is a bit
muddier in Lewis's case insofar as he wants to claim that the 
intuitive possibilities include universes in which the laws of nature
are quite a lot different from those in our universe and, hence, that
there are worlds in which these possibilities are realized. But it is
not clear how Lewis's commitment even to such remote worlds requires 
him to acknowledge a primitive modality. Likewise, we may have strong
intuitions that, say, it is impossible that there be stones capable 
of thought or that 5 plus 7 be something other than 12, and hence 
that there are no worlds in which those propositions are true. But 
there is no obvious point at which Lewis is forced to say that there 
<em>cannot be</em> any such worlds. Rather, all he needs to say is 
that there is no reason to think that the existence of such worlds is
in any way suggested by the recombination principles <b>R1</b> and 
<b>R2</b>. (For more in defense of Lewis on this point, see Divers 
and Melia 2002.) </p>

    <h3>The Charge of Irrelevance</h3>

    <p>

A frequent objection raised against Lewis &mdash; presented 
forcefully by, e.g., Salmon (1988) &mdash; is that, in general, the 
truth value of a <i>de re</i> modal statement is obviously not 
determined in any way by how things stand among entities that bear 
absolutely no spatial or temporal connection to the actual world, 
among entities that bear no intrinsic connection to us. In a word, 
what goes on in Lewis's worlds is largely <em>irrelevant</em> to the 
modal facts of <em>our</em> world. Intuitively, that Socrates could 
have been a politician has something intrinsically to do with 
<i>Socrates himself</i>. On Lewis's telling, however, whether 
Socrates could have been a politician is determined by what happens 
to <i>someone else</i>, <i>somewhere else</i>. Intuitively, however, 
what happens to someone other than Socrates in some other world 
&mdash; even a spitting image of him in a world that is a spitting 
image of ours &mdash; has no more to do with what could have happened
to him than does what happens to someone who resembles him in, say, 
New York City. </p>

    <p>

For all its intuitive force, the objection is arguably 
question-begging: Lewis's claim is precisely that the allegedly 
irrelevant connections <em>are</em> what determine modal truth 
values. The objection, at root, is simply that our semantical 
intuitions tell us otherwise. Other things being equal, dissonance 
with strong intuitions can be decisive in a philosophical dispute. 
However, while consanance with intuitions is desirable, semantical 
intuitions can be trumped by a theory's explanatory breadth. Thus, as
he does in response to the incredulous stare, Lewis would likely 
argue that we are entirely warranted in ignoring the intuitions in 
question so long as there is no theory that accommodates them whose 
explanatory power is at least roughly equivalent to his theory. </p>

    <h3>Coarse-grained Intensions</h3>
    
    <p>

Lewis inherits a general problem for the possible world analysis of 
intensional entities, namely, that they are too "coarse-grained". A 
proposition <b>p</b> is necessary just in case it is true in all 
possible worlds. On Lewis's analysis, <b>p</b> is true in <i>w</i> 
just in case <i>w</i> &isin; <b>p</b>. It follows that <i>p</i> is 
necessary just in case, for all worlds <i>w</i>, <i>w</i> &isin; 
<i>p</i>, i.e., just in case <i>p</i> is the set of all possible 
worlds. As sets with the same members are identical, it follows that,
on the concretist analysis, there is only one necessary truth. This 
is intuitively problematic. The propositions <b>that all red things 
have a color</b> and <b>that there are infinitely many prime 
numbers</b> are, intuitively, quite distinct; one is about a color, 
the other about a certain type of natural number. Both, however, are 
necessary and are identical according to the analysis above, 
intuitions to the contrary notwithstanding. Similar problems arise 
for properties and relations. </p>

    <p>

Lewis (1986, 55&ndash;59) is of course well-aware of this objection 
and mounts a sophisticated response. His basic line is that there are
numerous conceptions of propositions, properties, and relations, only
one of which, admittedly coarse-grained, is captured by the definitions 
in 
 <a href="index-2.html#Plenitude">&sect;2.1.4</a>.
 More complex set theoretic constructions however can be defined that 
play the roles of finer-grained intensions as needed. (See 
 <a href="index-2.html#AbsModIntEnt">&sect;2.2.2</a>
 for further discussion.) </p>

    <h3>Challenges to the Completeness of Lewis's Program</h3>

    <h4>Island Universes</h4>

    <p>

A surprisingly simple challenge to completeness is the problem of 
<em>island universes</em>. Intuitively, <em>one</em> way things could
be is that there are <em>multiple</em> physical universes each of 
which is spatio-temporally unrelated to all of the others. Why could 
it not be the case, for example, that the actual world consists of 
exactly two, symmetrical, physical universes, each the mirror image 
of the other, as described in Adams 1981, albeit, in addition, 
spatio-temporally unconnected from each other? For the concretist, 
such purported possibilities appear to be logically incoherent. For a
physical universe is a maximal object in the concretist sense &mdash;
an object such that anything spatio-temporally related to it is part 
of it. Hence, the translation of "Possibly, there are multiple 
spatio-temporally unrelated physical universes" into the concretist 
framework is "There is a world in which there are multiple worlds". 
Since all of the objects within a single world are spatio-temporally 
related, the translation entails that there is an object &mdash; a 
world &mdash; all of whose parts are spatio-temporally related such 
that some of those parts are not spatio-temporally related. </p>

    <p>

Lewis (1986, 66ff) rejects the possibility of island universes and 
attempts to explain away the initial intuition. Bricker (2001) argues
that Lewis's response does not adequately explain away the intuition 
and, indeed, argues that they follow from the Humean denial of 
necessary connections that underlies Lewis's recombination principle 
<b>R2</b>. He then argues (&sect;3.2) that concretism can accommodate
island universes simply by amending the standard analysis of 
possibility such that a proposition is <i>possible</i> if and only if
it is true at some nonempty class of worlds. This allows island 
universes to be possible (as they will just comprise multiple 
concrete worlds) without there being a world at which any island 
universes exist. However, even still, Bricker (<i>ibid.</i>, 
&sect;3.3) points out, this move leaves the concretist unable to 
countenance the intuitive possibility that the <em>actual</em> world 
comprises multiple island universes without abandoning the indexical 
account of &lsquo;actual&rsquo; and its cognates and invoking instead
an absolute metaphysical distinction between those worlds that are 
actual and those that are merely possible, a move that Lewis would in
no wise accept. </p>

    <a name="Aliens"></a>
    <h4>Alien Properties</h4>

    <p>

Another challenge to the concretist concerns so-called &ldquo;alien 
properties&rdquo; (Lewis 1986, 91&ndash;92). Intuitively, there could
have been things of a very different kind from very different from 
anything in the actual world, so different, in fact that they are not
reasonably thought of as the result of reorganizing duplicates of 
parts of the actual world &mdash; a very different sort of 
fundamental particle, say. But if so, the challenge goes, 
recombination does not suffice to account for the existence of the 
worlds needed to provide truth conditions for this intuitive 
possibility and, hence, needs supplementation. Divers and Melia 
(2002) propose a strong principle <b>OAN</b> that entails the 
existence of infinitely many alien properties but go on to show that,
even given the principle, Lewis's translation scheme is still 
incomplete: Given <b>OAN</b>, there will still be intuitive 
possibilities that do not translate into truths of concretism 
(<i>ibid</i>., 31&ndash;35). </p>

    <p>

However, the challenge of alien properties itself is arguably the 
product of the same misconception noted in 
 <a href="index-2.html#Plenitude">&sect;2.1.5</a>.
 Lewis agrees that recombinations of this-world duplicates do not 
suffice to &ldquo;generate&rdquo; alien possibilities. But this it is
a confusion to think that this is the purpose of the principle of 
Recombination. Recombination is a principle designed, vividly if 
perhaps only partially, to <em>express</em> the plenitude of worlds; 
it is not meant as a sort of axiom from which the existence of 
arbitrary worlds can in some sense be derived. Rather, given any 
intuitive possibility, it simply follows from the stipulated 
completeness of Lewis's account that the concrete worlds required for
its truth condition exist; Recombination, in turn, expresses the 
richness of the worlds whose existence follows from those concrete 
worlds in virtue of the plenitude of logical space. </p>
      
    <h3>The Threat of Paradox</h3>

    <p>

Lewis's liberal use of sets in his theory raises the specter of 
paradox, one concerning the principle of Recombination and another 
that stems from his adoption of the possible worlds conception of 
propositions. </p>

    
    <h4><a name="ParRecomb">Paradox and Recombination</a></h4>

    <p>

As it stands, the principle <b>R</b> of recombination leads directly 
to paradox. Forrest and Armstrong 1984 suggest a particularly simple 
one: The worlds themselves are objects. Moreover, according to Lewis,
the worlds form a set <i>W</i> and, hence, there is some number of 
them. Hence, by <b>R</b>, there is a distinct world <b>w*</b> that 
itself contains duplicates of all the worlds. Now, let <i>E</i> be 
the set of electrons in <b>w*</b> and suppose the cardinality of 
<i>E</i> is &kappa;, which we can safely assume to be infinite. By 
<b>R</b> again, for every subset <i>E</i>&prime; of <i>E</i> there is
a distinct world <b>w</b><sub><i>E</i></sub> containing duplicates of
exactly those electrons and no others. Hence, there are exactly 
2<sup>&kappa;</sup> such worlds. By hypothesis, there are distinct 
duplicates of each of those worlds in <b>w*</b> and, hence, <b>w*</b>
must contain more electrons than, by assumption, it contains. </p>

    <p>

A way out of this paradox is to deny that worlds and, hence, objects 
generally, form sets. Indeed, that they do not seems to follow from 
<b>R</b>. For <b>R</b> entails that, for any cardinal number &kappa;,
there is a world containing at least &kappa; objects. It follows 
that, for any cardinal &kappa;, there are <i>more than</i> &kappa; 
objects. Hence, by some basic set theory, there is no set containing 
all the objects. Assuming furthermore that there is a definite 
cardinal number of objects in any world, it follows that there is no 
set of all worlds. But this appears to lead to theoretical disaster 
as well. For, given Lewis's definitions of intensional entities in 
 <a href="index-2.html#Reductionism">&sect;2.1.3</a>,
 it follows that certain intuitive propositions, properties, and 
relations do not exist. Notably, there are no necessary propositions.
For, on Lewis's account, a proposition <b>p</b> is true in <b>w</b> 
just in case <b>w</b> &isin; <b>p</b> and <b>p</b> is necessary just 
in case it is true in all worlds, that is, just in case <b>p</b> is 
exactly the set of all worlds. Likewise, if there is no cardinal 
limit on the number of counterparts any object can have (and it is 
difficult to see why there should be), then there is no such thing as
the counterpart relation, as the number of pairs 
&lang;<b>x</b>,<b>y</b>&rang; such that <b>y</b> is a counterpart of 
<b>x</b> is simply too large to be a set. Lewis, therefore, finds 
himself forced to place restrictions on <b>R</b> that are arguably 
<b>ad hoc</b> &mdash; notably, that there is a cardinal upper bound 
on the number of objects that can fit into any possible physical 
spacetime (1986, 89&ndash;90, 101&ndash;4). Moreover, these restrictions threaten
the completeness of Lewis's program, as certain intuitive modal 
truths are false under translation into Lewis's metaphysics, notably,
the proposition that, for any number <b>n</b>, it is possible that 
there are <b>n</b> things. (For further discussion, see Forrest and 
Amstrong 1984, Lewis 1986, 89&ndash;92 and 101&ndash;104, Nolan 1986, Pruss 2001,
and Sider 2009.) </p>

    <h4>Paradox and Propositions</h4>

    <p>

A second paradox deriving from Kaplan (1995) threatens any account 
&mdash; Lewis's in particular &mdash; that follows possible world 
semantics in defining propositions to be arbitrary sets of worlds 
(see Davies 1981, 262; Lewis 1986, 104&ndash;108; Bueno et al. 
2014). Let <b>t</b> be a given time and consider the following
thesis: </p>

    <a name="E"></a>
    <table>
      <tr valign="baseline">
	<td width="50" align="right"><b>E</b></td>
	<td width="10"></td>
	<td>
	  For every proposition <b>p</b>, it is possible that
	  <b>p</b> is the only proposition entertained (by anyone)
	  at <b>t</b>.
	</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>

It follows from <b>E</b> that, for every proposition <b>p</b>, there 
is at least one possible world unique to <b>p</b>, a world in which 
that proposition alone is entertained at <b>t</b>. Hence, there have 
to be at least as many worlds as propositions. But if every set of 
worlds is a proposition, then, by Cantor's Theorem, there are 
<em>more</em> propositions than worlds. Contradiction. </p>

    <p>

Lewis's response is, not implausibly, to deny the thesis <b>E</b> 
that every proposition &mdash; every arbitrary subset of an infinite 
plenitude of worlds &mdash; is possibly the content of some agent's 
thought (<i>ibid</i>., 105). A consequence of this move is that it 
raises doubts about the identification of propositions with arbitrary
sets of worlds. As noted already in 
 <a href="index-2.html#AbsModIntEnt">&sect;2.2.2</a>,
 however, Lewis adopts a very flexible, pragmatic attitude toward the 
nature of propositions, and, hence, would not find this consequence 
particularly worrisome. </p>

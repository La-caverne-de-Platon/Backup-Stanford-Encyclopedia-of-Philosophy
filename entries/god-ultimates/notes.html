 These names are found in Hinduism, Daoism, Buddhism, monotheisms such
as Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Sikhism, and Plotinus&rsquo; and

 According to Hedges, particularists take each tradition to be a
&ldquo;network of terms and practices that make sense only in relation
to itself&rdquo; (2014: 205&ndash;206). If so, no concepts can be
shared between them; <em>a fortiori</em>, no concept(s) of ultimacy
either.</p>

 Sister Gayatriprana (2020) in particular identifies multiple chains
of influence between models of God and Brahman running from East to
West and West to East. One interesting case in point is the rise of
more personalist views of Brahman in the Bhakti schools of Hinduism
involving &ldquo;a degree of deep interconnection between the human
and the divine&rdquo; occurring during the period of Muslim rule in
India from the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries (2020: xxii; more
coming on the Bhakti schools in
 <a href="index-2.html#ModeBrahGodDao">Section 2 of this entry</a>).</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Wildman 2001: 269; 2020: 119, 127. Berthrong backs Neville&rsquo;s
and Wildman&rsquo;s idea, saying that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
anything less [than vague categories and metaphors]&hellip;would be
trivial in light of the mass of data demanding to be addressed. There
is an old and ironic Chinese curse that states, may you live in
interesting times. For the comparative philosopher or theologian this
can be transposed into: may you live in cultural and conceptually rich
times. (2001: 255&ndash;256)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 To demonstrate how Schellenberg&rsquo;s account surfaces on the face
of the vague categorial terms from the paragraph above:
Tillich&rsquo;s &ldquo;object of ultimate concern&rdquo; is
soteriologically ultimate; John Hick&rsquo;s &ldquo;the Real&rdquo; is
metaphysically ultimate; and Neville and Wildman&rsquo;s &ldquo;that
which is most important to religious life because of the nature of
reality&rdquo; implies both soteriological and metaphysical
ultimacy.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Clooney 2001 follows Schellenberg&rsquo;s conjuncts in his discussion
of Indian religious ultimates:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Ultimate reality might be described as follows: that which cannot be
surpassed [axiological ultimacy]; that from which all realities,
persons, and things come, that on which they depend, and that into
which they return upon dissolution [metaphysical ultimacy]; that by
knowledge of which one knows everything else and reaches liberation
[soteriological ultimacy]. (2001: 95, bracketed additions mine)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Similarly, Mary-Jane Rubenstein says God is &ldquo;the source of all
things, the life of all things, the end of all things&rdquo;, a
statement that agrees with Schellenberg if the &ldquo;life&rdquo; of a
thing is its value (2019: 16:29).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 E.g., one route is to take metaphysical ultimacy to entail
axiological ultimacy which, with the existence of the cosmos, entails
soteriological ultimacy for its creatures. For a creative
reconstruction of, e.g., Aquinas&rsquo; argument along these lines,
see Zagzebski 2007: 81&ndash;84.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 See
 <a href="index-2.html#ModeGod">Section 2.2</a>
 for an explanation. The inheritance is visible in the fact that each
of the three categories of being is maximized and in their
conjunction. (In fact, axiological ultimacy by itself may capture
Anselm&rsquo;s formula). Elliott also reads Schellenberg as
&ldquo;taking a cue from Anselm (and frankly, the entire history of
Perfect Being Theology)&rdquo; (2017: 104).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 &ldquo;Chroniclers assumed that the &lsquo;Great Spirit&rsquo;,
&lsquo;Master of Life&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Grandfather God&rsquo; were
somehow real Native American terms, instead of Euro-Christian
interpolations. In fact, Natives have no high-God concept, let alone
God concepts that mimic male-dominated hierarchies. Instead, we have
Councils of Elder Spirits operating in replication of our
participatory democracies&hellip;.each [of whom] simply knows more
about itself and its immediate purview than does anyone
else&hellip;.[and who] act in concert&rdquo; and by accident and
consensus to create, e.g., life on earth (Mann 2010: 33&ndash;34).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Schellenberg draws this distinction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we have something distinctively religious here [in the triple
formula], something that can clearly be distinguished from what a
materialist might say, who nevertheless thinks there exists something
metaphysically ultimate. (2009: 31)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Richard Dawkins says something similar when he calls the view that
&ldquo;God is nature&hellip;.sexed-up atheism&rdquo; and concludes
that &ldquo;Deliberately to confuse [it with theism and deism]
is&hellip;an act of intellectual high treason&rdquo; (2006:
18&ndash;19).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Specifically, using &ldquo;M&rdquo;, &ldquo;A&rdquo; and
&ldquo;S&rdquo; for metaphysical, axiological and soteriological
ultimacy respectively, the disjunction entails these disjuncts: M, A,
S, \((\textrm{M} \lor \textrm{A}),\) \((\textrm{M} \lor \textrm{S}),\)
\((\textrm{A} \lor \textrm{S}),\) or \((\textrm{M} \lor \textrm{A}
\lor \textrm{S}).\) So this entry uses &ldquo;metaphysically
ultimate&rdquo; for the disjunct M and &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; and
variants for two or more of these disjuncts. Thanks go to John Bishop
for what is right in this paragraph.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 In addition, to neologize another adjective: on a prototype theory of
concepts and taking the full conjunction \((M \lor A \lor S)\) as the
prototype of ultimacy, perhaps there are degrees of ultimacy, ranging
from triple ultimacy as paradigmatically ultimate to single ultimacy
as &ldquo;ultimate-ish&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 The model&rsquo;s finding: in aggregate, it was in fact better
overall for agents to cooperate instead of defect. The example is
cited in Emily C. Parke and Anya Plutynski 2020: 65. Regarding
definitions of &ldquo;model&rdquo;: Parke and Plutynski define
&ldquo;models&rdquo; in a scientific context as &ldquo;idealized
interpreted structures representing target systems&rdquo; and takes
their structure to be &ldquo;relevant to a scientist&rsquo;s research
agenda and aims&rdquo; (2020: 61, 63). Ian Barbour similarly defines
&ldquo;model&rdquo; &ldquo;broadly speaking&rdquo; as &ldquo;a
symbolic representation of selected aspects of&hellip;a complex system
for particular purposes&rdquo; (1974: 6).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 On different aims: Barbour suggests that both scientific and
religious models have cognitive functions of explaining and
interpreting observations of the natural world or human experiences,
respectively, but that religious models also have non-cognitive
functions that &ldquo;have no parallel in science&rdquo;, such as the
expression of attitudes and commitment to a form of morality and life
(1974: 7, 27&ndash;8, 68&ndash;9). On similarities (1) and (2):
Barbour suggests that models represent &ldquo;aspects of the world
which are not directly accessible to us&rdquo; and &ldquo;that only
certain aspects of the world are brought into prominence by a model,
while other aspects are neglected&rdquo;, respectively (1974: 7, 47);
Parke and Plutynski echo both points (2020: 55, 60).</p>

 Swinburne 1993, which attempts to show that it that it is logically
possible for God to be omnipresent, incorporeal, personal, free,
creator of the universe, omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good
(impeccable), a source of moral obligation, eternal, immutable, and
necessary, by a careful analysis of each. Regarding
&ldquo;concepts&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;conceptions&rdquo;, see Bishop 2009:
422. Though his account there discusses &ldquo;conceptions&rdquo; as
metaphysical fillers of role concepts, there are metaphysical fillers
for higher-level concepts more broadly. For example, the concept of
God as &ldquo;that which is perfect&rdquo; is not a role concept since
its attributes are intrinsic instead of extrinsic, but it still has
fillers in the different conceptions of what it takes to be
perfect.</p>

 About the hesitancy: Neville&rsquo;s indexical signs and other mere
reference-fixers for ultimacy may be limiting cases of models since
the representation is instrumental or perhaps
&ldquo;<em>alienans</em>&rdquo;, as Vallicella explains it: the
representation &ldquo;shifts, alters, alienates, the sense of the noun
that it modifies&rdquo;, as &ldquo;decoy&rdquo; does in &ldquo;decoy
duck&rdquo; since it implies the referent of &ldquo;duck&rdquo; is not
a duck (Vallicella 2006 [2019: sec. 4.2]). See the ineffability
objection in the next section for more forms of speech about ultimacy
which also may be <em>alienans</em>. Regarding purposes modelers of
ultimacy may have, see

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Perry Schmidt-Leukel makes two interesting claims about
Nagarjuna&rsquo;s related distinction between conventional reality and
ultimate reality:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>(1) that this distinction is made only &ldquo;from the perspective
of conventional reality&hellip;where conceptual distinctions apply
&ndash; in order to point towards ultimate reality where no conceptual
distinctions whatsoever apply;&rdquo; and</li>

<li>(2) &ldquo;that ultimate truth/reality cannot be taught without
recourse to the conventional&rdquo; (2019: 477).</li>
</ol>

<p>
In other words, one has to slog through the kind of conceptual
distinctions at play in this entry to understand what is ultimate in a
way that will allow one to drop these distinctions.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 <em>Nota bene</em>, Schmidt-Leukel writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
At times proponents of this model oscillate between a conception that
understands all three factors as distinct ultimates in their own
right, and a conception that sees them as three dimensions of a single
complex ultimate reality. (2019: 482)</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="note-22">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 The pantheistic-sounding passages include:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
God is the only substance that exists or can be conceived&hellip;.
[and]&hellip;.Whatever exists is in God, and nothing can exist or be
conceived without God. (1677, <em>Ethics</em> Part I.14, 15)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
See Rubenstein 2018 for a variety of pantheisms from Bruno to
animisms.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 One might read these distinctions existentially by replacing the
world with oneself, to understand at a fundamental level who one is
and how one fits into the wider reality. So, e.g., monism becomes
&ldquo;what is ultimate and I are the same stuff;&rdquo; dualism that
&ldquo;what is ultimate is different from me;&rdquo; panentheism that
&ldquo;I am in (or part of) what is ultimate;&rdquo; merotheism that
&ldquo;what is ultimate is in (or part of) me&rdquo;. Thanks to David
Perry for this thought.</p>

 Many Hindus refer to the tradition as &ldquo;<em>San&#257;tana
Dharma</em>&rdquo; (the eternal dharma, or order, or way of life).
This is an older, and an indigenous, term, but it, too, did not become
widespread as a designator for the whole collection of these
traditions until relatively recently.</p>

 The Vedanta school takes the Upanishads to be the end of the Vedas
both literally as an appendix to the Vedas and figuratively as their
whole point. The chronological order of the Vedas is the original
hymns (e.g., the Rig Veda), the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas (a.k.a the
forest treatises), and then the Upanishads, though the oldest
Upanishad is an Aranyaka.</p>

 Nicholson 2010. From Jeffery Long:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The six schools are &ldquo;<em>S&#257;&#7747;khya </em>and <em>Yoga
</em>[the relationship of these two could be seen as one of theory
(<em>S&#257;&#7747;khya</em>) to practice (<em>Yoga</em>)];
<em>Ny&#257;ya </em>and <em>Vai&#347;e&#7779;ika </em>[the traditional
Hindu systems of logic and cosmology, respectively, which eventually
merged]; and <em>M&#299;m&#257;&#7747;s&#257; </em>and
<em>Ved&#257;nta </em>[systems of Vedic exegesis, with
<em>M&#299;m&#257;&#7747;s&#257; </em>being focused on the
ritualistic, early Vedic texts and <em>Ved&#257;nta</em> being focused
on &lsquo;the end of the Veda&rsquo;&mdash;the Upani&#7779;ads and the
philosophy taught therein]&rdquo;. (Correspondence, 12 March 2020)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Interestingly, the Samkhya school has a view of God reminiscent of
Aristotle&rsquo;s Unmoved Mover or deism: God is a <em>purusha</em> (a
soul) that unlike most souls never got bound to the cycle of rebirth
and thus is ever-free and not engaged with the world.</p>
</div>

 The one but important exception is the Dvaita schools which identify
Brahman with God, i.e., Ishvara. For &ldquo;theocosm&rdquo;, see Long
2007: 81. Long was unaware of this at the time, but
&ldquo;theocosm&rdquo; was used previously, e.g., in
<em>Reconciliation by Incarnation</em> by David Worthington Simon
(1898: 201) and in <em>The God of Science</em> (1928) by Arvid
Reuterdahl where he developed a &ldquo;Theocosmic Diagram.&rdquo;</p>

 In process thought, there is no name for the theocosm but, e.g., in
his gloss on process thought Wesley Wildman calls the theocosm
&ldquo;ultimate reality&rdquo; and the parts &ldquo;God&rdquo; and
&ldquo;the world&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Ultimate reality is the eternal symbiotic relationship between this
natural God and the rest of natural reality, in which the two mutually
influence and constitute each other. (2017: 22)</p>

 These associations make Vedantic philosophies like what Pierre Hadot
takes Western ancient philosophies to be: they are a <em>bios</em> or
way of life (1981 [1995]). For more on the relationship between text
and experience in Vedanta, see Long 2020, section 5.4.</p>

 Interestingly, <em>pace</em> those who read him as a pantheist,
Shankara supports the asymmetric claim of panentheism
counterfactually: if the unique qualities of a material effect were
destroyed, the essential qualities of its/the material cause would
still remain, e.g., if I shatter the pot I made from the clay, I still
have clay; if I smelt down a gold necklace, I still have gold. See
Shankara&rsquo;s commentary on the Brahmasutra 2.1.9, Swami
Vireswarananda 1936: 166-167, and Rambachan 2006: 75.</p>

 Ramanuja&rsquo;s synthesis grew out of his spiritual path, first as a
serious student of Advaita, then as a convert to Vaishnavism. It is
testimony to Shankara&rsquo;s importance that it took 300 years for
someone to dissent, and that Ramanuja had to survive a murder plot to
make his conversion and critique (Tapasyananda 1990: 1&ndash;14,
32&ndash;33).</p>

 It is said that during these six months of direct perception of
nirguna Brahman, Ramakrishna&rsquo;s &ldquo;perception of the world
vanished entirely&rdquo; (Long 2020: 172, quoting Swami
Saradananda).</p>

 Jeffery D. Long conveys Ramakrishna&rsquo;s idea of the deep
complexity of Brahman by dubbing his system &ldquo;Anekanta
Vedanta&rdquo;, where &ldquo;anekanta&rdquo; is the Jain concept
&ldquo;non-one-sided&rdquo; (2020: 158).</p>

 It is clearer to say &ldquo;reality-providing&rdquo; cause vs.
material cause to clarify that Brahman is not material (Rambachan
2006: 126, footnote 10). He offers a helpful analogy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Like a spider projecting a web from itself, but unlike a bird building
its nest, Brahman brings forth the world without the aid of anything
extraneous. (2006: 70)</p>

 Davies&rsquo; framing implies that one thing produces another thing,
but other perfect being theologians deny that God is a thing at all.
The objectors are still generally dualists, though, taking God&rsquo;s
nature to be absolutely distinct from the cosmos&rsquo; because, e.g.,
God transcends the world.</p>

 The Greek philosophers each had different names and ideas of the
ultimate, but most used nascent perfections. To offer just two
examples from the pre-Socratics: Parmenides&rsquo; described his
&ldquo;One Being&rdquo; as &ldquo;unborn, imperishable, whole, unique,
immovable and without end&rdquo; (in Guthrie 1965, see especially pp.
26 and 31, verses 3&ndash;5 and 22&ndash;25 of fr. 8, see early
mention of simplicity, immutability, and eternality), and
Anaxagoras&rsquo; said &ldquo;Mind&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is something infinite and independent, and is mixed with no
thing&hellip;.the finest and purest of all things, and has all
judgment of everything and greatest power, and everything that has
life, both greater and smaller, all these Mind controls. (in Guthrie
1965: 272&ndash;273, with proto-concepts of aseity, axiological
perfection, impeccability, omniscience and omnipotence)</p>

 On dropping immutability and impassibility:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We clearly find in Scripture, it is argued, that God does experience
emotional change&mdash;for example, really does rejoice and/or become
sorrowful in response to our actions. This however, is not an
essential change in God&rsquo;s nature. God is essentially perfect in
every way. And for God to be affected by (appropriately emotively
dependent on) what happens to those with whom God is in relationship
makes God a more complete and admirable being than one who is
incapable of experiencing such change. (Basinger 2013: 266)</p>

 In her treatment of Alexander&rsquo;s model, Emily Thomas noted its
merotheistic God-world relation, without giving it a name:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Alexander is sometimes taken to be a &ldquo;panentheist&rdquo;. If
panentheism is taken to mean that the universe is &ldquo;in&rdquo;
God, then this characterization is straightforwardly incorrect: in
fact, Alexander holds that deity is strictly contained
&ldquo;in&rdquo; the universe. (2016: 255)</p>

 For the contemporary revival of axiarchism, see Derek Parfit 1998,
Nicholas Rescher 2010, John Leslie 1979, 1989, 2001 and 2016. Though
Leslie in particular argues for an &ldquo;extreme&rdquo; form of
axiarchism on which the purely ideal &ldquo;goodness of [a] possible
world is what makes it actual&rdquo; (Tim Mulgan 2017: sec. 1.1),
Bishop and Perszyk ratchet back to a milder axiarchism, on which
something concretely real makes the universe actual, namely actual,
concrete &ldquo;full realizations of the supreme good&rdquo; (2017:
613). Mulgan argues that axiarchism is not as implausible as it might
sound: it is already at work in the ontological argument and the
fine-tuning argument; it has a fit with the growing
&ldquo;non-naturalism among moral philosophers&rdquo;, and more (2017:
sec. 1.1 and 1.2). He also offers his own axiarchic view there in
which reality comes to be because it has a purpose, but because the
purpose is not about us, he calls this an &ldquo;ananthropocentric
purposivism&rdquo;. Mulgan&rsquo;s view will be referenced in
 <a href="index-2.html#ModeDao">Section 2.3</a>
 where its ananthropocentrism surfaces in a standard model of the
Dao.</p>

 One still might ask though with Marilyn McCord Adams how &ldquo;we
eliminate the parallel hypothesis&rdquo; that things seem as directed
to evil as they do to Love (2016: 137)? Bishop and Perszyk respond
that euteleological Christians anyway can answer <em>a
posteriori</em>: Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection show that the
power of love is stronger than the power of evil, so Love will win in
the end (2016: 124).</p>

 Even if deity is formally the next level the universe will realize,
this does not entail that it is the universe&rsquo;s <em>telos</em>.
It is possible that a next stage of development can, far from drawing
purpose out of what came before, actually obscure it, as a prolonged
death without dignity can make &ldquo;a life that has been well
lived&hellip;ever after [be] seen through the smudged glass of its
last few years&rdquo; (Nuland 1995: 105).</p>

 There is a debate among scholars about whether to define the start of
Daoism with the <em>Daodejing</em> or with the first definable Daoist
community, generally taken to be when in 142 CE Zhang Ling became the
first Celestial Master of what became Celestial Master Daoism, a
movement which spread to all parts of China by the fourth century. For
more see Kleeman 2016.</p>

 <em>Yinyang</em> is a binary &ldquo;pattern embedded in the nature of
all beings&rdquo;, from being receptive/still/empty, waxing to being
creative/energetic/full, then waning back again. See Wang 2012:

 One important competing interpretation of 0 and 1 is visible in both
Schipper and Robson who separately suggest that 0 is primordial chaos
which &ldquo;holds within itself the whole universe but in a diffuse,
undifferentiated and potential state&rdquo; [not identified as the
Dao] and 1 is <em>Qi</em>, pure energy-matter that emerges from the
chaos, followed by <em>yinyang</em>, etc. (Schipper 1982 [1993: 35];
Robson 2015: 1483).</p>

 Moreover, even if we were to read the standard model as a monism as
in, e.g., traditional Advaita Vedanta, it would still offer a fresh
insight because being and non-being are reversed: in Advaita, Brahman
is being and the cosmos is nonbeing, a mere appearance; in the common
view of Daoism traced here, Dao is nonbeing and makes possible the
world of beings.</p>

 &ldquo;Dao is not really &lsquo;infinite&rsquo; nor
&lsquo;transcendent&rsquo; but infinitesimal, the faintest, most
imperceptible of breaths, the darkest shade of light, the smallest
possible contrast that, in its infinite fractal-like recursions,
multiplies to constitute the shocking wealth of cosmic power. This is
the ultimate mystery of Dao: that subtle void and intangible
formlessness should be the root of all becoming&rdquo; (Kohn 2001:
18). In other words, as Stephen Yablo once said in an entirely
different context: this is apparently meager input with torrential
output.</p>

The full quote from Kierkegaard is:</p>

<blockquote>
If one who lives in the midst of Christendom goes up to the house of
God, the house of the true God, with the true conception of God in his
knowledge, and prays, but prays in a false spirit; and one who lives
in an idolatrous community prays with the entire passion of the
infinite, although his eyes rest upon an idol: where is there [the]
most truth? The one prays in truth to God though he worships an idol;
the other prays falsely to the true God, and hence worships in fact an
idol. (1846/1974, pp. 179&ndash;180)

 As Elliott put it, the more general the model of the ultimate, the
greater its &ldquo;epistemic comfort&rdquo;, its &ldquo;honest chance
of being true&rdquo; (2017: 105 and footnote 28).</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">The Role of Decoherence in Quantum Mechanics</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 The first version of this entry was based on a talk given at the
Exploratory Workshop on <em>Quantum Mechanics on the Large Scale</em>,
The Peter Wall Institute for Advanced Studies, The University of
British Columbia, 17&ndash;27 April 2003, on whose website are linked
electronic versions of that and several of the other talks (see the
 <a href="index-2.html#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>).</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Unfortunately, the distinction between &lsquo;true&rsquo; collapse
(as it appears in collapse approaches to quantum mechanics) and
&lsquo;apparent&rsquo; collapse (as it appears in no-collapse
approaches to quantum mechanics) is often overlooked, muddling
conceptual discussions. Further on this point, see e.g. Pearle (1997)
and Zeh (2003a, pp. 28&ndash;29).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Since the probabilities that are said to interfere in fact refer to a
separate experiment, Heisenberg in the uncertainty paper notes that he
does not like the phrase &lsquo;interference of
probabilities&rsquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Realistically, each single scattering will not produce enough
entanglement, in the sense that the components going through the two
slits will couple to non-orthogonal states of the environment, thus
experiencing only a partial suppression of interference. However,
repeated scatterings will lead to coupling with orthogonal states and
suppress interference very effectively (see the discussion of
decoherence rates in the next subsection).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 These values are calculated based on the classic model by Joos and
Zeh (1985). Length and time scales for more massive objects are
further reduced. For a not too technical partial summary of Joos and
Zeh&rsquo;s results, see also Bacciagaluppi (2000).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 For further details of the decoherent histories approach, see also
the overview articles by Halliwell (1995, 2010) and by Hartle
(2010).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>  In the Heisenberg picture, it is
operators that evolve unitarily rather than states, i.e. instead of
considering time-independent operators \(A\) and time-dependent states
\(\varrho(t)=U_{ts} \varrho(s) U^{*}_{ts}\) as in the Schr&ouml;dinger
picture (where \(U_{ts}\) represents the unitary evolution operator
from time \(s\) to time \(t\), and its adjoint \(U^{*}_{ts}\) the
inverse evolution), one considers time-dependent operators
\(\mathrm{A}(t)=U^{*}_{ts} \mathrm{A}(s) U_{ts}\) and time-independent
states \(\varrho\). The two pictures are generally equivalent (even
though the Heisenberg picture is more convenient in quantum field
theory), but see the qualification in
 <a href="index-2.html#Hei">Section 3.4.2</a>.
 </p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 This condition can be independently motivated. For instance, weak
decoherence for subsystems does not imply weak decoherence for the
total system, even if the total state is a product (simply because the
product of the real parts of two complex numbers is not the real part
of their product). For this and further arguments, see Di&oacute;si
(1994, in the
 <a href="index-2.html#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>).
 </p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Similar results involving imperfectly correlated records can be
derived in the case of mixed states (Halliwell 1999).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 If so, the idea does not seem quite new. A related discussion of
causality was given in detail by Grete Hermann (1935), probably the
most important philosophical commentator of the emerging Copenhagen
school, specifically in the context of (Weizs&auml;cker&rsquo;s
analysis of) the Heisenberg microscope. Also Wheeler&rsquo;s (1978)
famous &lsquo;delayed choice&rsquo; experiments are presented by him
as affecting the past in this way.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 For a review of more detailed arguments see e.g. Zurek (2003, pp.
28&ndash;30). In particular they can be obtained from the Wigner
function formalism, see e.g. Zurek (1991) and in more detail Zurek and
Paz (1994, who then apply these results to derive chaotic
trajectories in quantum mechanics); see also below,
 <a href="index-2.html#WorAccDec">Section 4.1</a>
 and Rosaler (2016).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 For a very accessible discussion of \(\alpha\)-particle tracks roughly
along these lines, see Barbour (1999, Chap. 20).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Von Neumann&rsquo;s theorem was later generalised by several authors,
the most general version being that of Bassi and Ghirardi (2000): see
the discussion in Section 3 of the entry on
 <a href="../qm-collapse/index.html">collapse theories</a>
 (and references therein). Alternative impossibility results focus on
the impossibility of obtaining the right transformation behaviour for
the state of the measured system (Bacciagaluppi 2014a). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 As a numerical example, take a macroscopic particle of radius 1cm
(mass 10g) interacting with air under normal conditions. After an hour
the overall spread of its state is of the order of 1m. (This estimate
uses equations [3.107] and [3.73] in Joos and Zeh (1985).)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 The modern version of Everett&rsquo;s servomechanisms are Jim
Hartle&rsquo;s IGUSes (Hartle 2005). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 The positive re-evaluation of Everett&rsquo;s original 1957 PhD
thesis (traditionally considered obscure) is the product of the
historical scholarship that has been flourishing since the 50-year
anniversary of Everett&rsquo;s thesis; see Everett (2012).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 E.g. Zurek&rsquo;s (1998) &lsquo;existential interpretation&rsquo;
aims to bring together certain aspects of Bohr and of Everett.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 For further details of the state of the art on the Everett
interpretation(s), see the recent collection by Saunders <em>et
al.</em> (2010), which contains the papers from the two international
conferences that celebrated the 50 years of Everett&rsquo;s original
paper, and Wallace&rsquo;s (2012a) definitive monograph.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Everett has traditionally also been thought to suffer from a problem
about the meaning of probabilities. This is arguably unfair to
Everett, who provides a very explicit discussion along the lines of a
&lsquo;typicality&rsquo; approach, as well as a proof of the Born rule
that is mathematically very close to the recent proof by Deutsch and
Wallace. For a discussion of Everett&rsquo;s approach, see the longer
version (with references) of my review of Everett (2012) in the
 <a href="index-2.html#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>,
 Bacciagaluppi (2013). For the definitive presentation of the
Deutsch&ndash;Wallace approach, see Wallace (2012a, Chapter 5).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Such a solution to the preferred basis problem might be thought to be
only partial, in the sense that there are many inequivalent ways of
selecting sets of decoherent histories (see e.g. Dowker and Kent 1995,
1996). On the other hand, this does not make &lsquo;our&rsquo; set of
histories any less decoherent.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 Cf. for instance how Everett phrases his solution to the
 <a href="../qt-epr/index.html">EPR paradox</a>
 (Everett 2012, pp. 157&ndash;158). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 Even in this case, however, decoherence is of crucial
importance, since the dynamical evolution of the minds will have a
physical correlate <em>only if</em> the corresponding physical
components are decohered (Felline and Bacciagaluppi 2013). (Thanks to
Martin Jones for discussion of this point.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 It is tempting to see the difference between (Saunders&ndash;Wallace)
decoherence-based many-worlds and (Zeh) decoherence-based many-minds
as merely conventional, since they arguably both share an ontology of
global wave functions and local (perhaps emergent) minds, and only
differ in the emphasis they place on different objectively present
structures in the same decohering wave function. Note also that if one
assumes that mentality can be associated only with certain decohering
structures of great complexity, this might have the advantage of
further reducing the remaining ambiguity about the preferred
&lsquo;basis&rsquo; (see Matthew Donald&rsquo;s website on &lsquo;A
Many-Minds Interpretation of Quantum Theory&rsquo; in the
 <a href="index-2.html#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>).
 Finally, regarding the distinction between global and local aspects of
decoherence, it should be noted that, since spacelike separated
systems can be entangled, even though suppression of interference
through interaction with the environment is a local mechanism it
indirectly affects also distant systems. If Alice&rsquo;s system
interacts with its local environment, that will guarantee that certain
components of Bob&rsquo;s system will in practice never be able to
interfere, even should Alice and Bob&rsquo;s systems be brought
together. (In many-worlds language, we are licensed to talk about
worlds splitting along spacelike hypersurfaces, even though splitting
in the sense of active suppression of interference propagates along
forward lightcones. Cf. Bacciagaluppi (2002) and Wallace (2012a); see
also the entry on
 <a href="../qm-action-distance/index.html">action at a distance in quantum mechanics</a>.
 Thanks to Wayne Myrvold for discussion of this point.) </p>

<div id="note-24">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 By the same token one can dismiss proposed variants of de
Broglie&ndash;Bohm theory that are not based on the position
representation, e.g. Epstein&rsquo;s (1953) momentum-based theory,
which would utterly fail to exhibit the correct &lsquo;collapse&rsquo;
behaviour and classical regime, precisely because decoherence
interactions are not momentum-based.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 Appleby discusses Bohmian trajectories in a model of decoherence and
obtains approximately classical trajectories, but under a special
assumption. (I would suggest to reinterpret Appleby&rsquo;s assumption
as an assumption about the effective wavefunction of the heat bath
with which the system interacts. That is, one should try to justify it
from a pilot-wave treatment of the bath.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 Sanz and Borondo (2009) simulate trajectories for the two-slit
experiment. One model is based on the reduced density matrix of the
system (and thus based on simple de-phasing), and still maintains the
no-crossing feature that troubles Holland (1996). The other model,
despite also being simplified, recovers the classical crossing of
trajectories. Sanz and co-workers (personal communication, November
2011) have also carried out simulations including explicit modelling
of the environment, and in situations more complex than the two-slit
experiment. These simulations seem to confirm that classical-like
trajectories can indeed be recovered in pilot-wave theory using
decoherence.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>
 Allori investigates in the first place the
&lsquo;short-wavelength&rsquo; limit of de Broglie&ndash;Bohm theory
(suggested by the analogy with the geometric limit in wave optics).
The role of decoherence in her analysis is crucial but limited to
<em>maintaining</em> the classical behaviour obtained under the
appropriate short-wavelength conditions, because the behaviour would
otherwise break down after a certain time.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 If this is not true in general, then provided the results of
observations are recorded in the configuration-space variables,
pilot-wave field theories could still recover at least the
<em>appearance</em> of classical trajectories (as in the
&lsquo;minimalist&rsquo; model by Struyve and Westman (2007)).
Decoherence would arguably still play a role at this level in
structuring these appearances (similarly to the role it plays e.g. in
many-minds theories, cf.
 <a href="index-2.html#EveInt">Section 3.1</a>
 ).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>  The collapse consists in
multiplying the wave function \(\psi(r)\) by a Gaussian of fixed width
\(a\), call it \(a_x (r)\), with a probability density for the centre
\(x\) of the Gaussian given by \(\int |a_x (r)\psi(r)|^2 dr\).  In
other words, if we denote by \(A_x\) the operator corresponding to
multiplication by the Gaussian \(a_x (r)\), the state \(\ket{\psi}\)
goes over to one of the continuously many possible states
\(A_x\ket{\psi}\) (up to renormalisation), with probability density
\(\langle\psi|A_x^*A_x|\psi\rangle\).  In technical language, this is
a measurement associated with a POVM (positive-operator valued
measure). In the original model, \(a=10^{-5}\)cm, and collapse occurs
with a probability per second \(1/\tau\), with \(\tau =10^{16}\)s.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>
 This modification was introduced because, due to the production of
energy associated with the collapse, the original model would have had
consequences for the predicted lifetime of the proton that were
already ruled out by existing experiments (Pearle and Squires 1994).
Later models also often use the formalism of <em>continuous
spontaneous localisation</em> (CSL), phrased in terms of stochastic
differential equations (Pearle 1989, also sketched in the entry on
 <a href="../qm-collapse/index.html">collapse theories</a>),
 but for present purposes we shall stick to the more elementary GRW
theory.</p>

 Cf. the exchange between Heisenberg and Dirac at the 1927 Solvay
conference, where Dirac expressed the view that experiments involve
&lsquo;an irrevocable choice of nature&rsquo;, but Heisenberg pointed
out that one can always perform subsequent interference experiments,
so that &lsquo;the <em>observer himself</em> makes a choice&rsquo;
(Bacciagaluppi and Valentini 2009, Section 6.3 and pp. 446&ndash;450).
With that Heisenberg perhaps meant to imply some role for idealism in
quantum mechanics (roughly along the lines of Fichte?), or perhaps he
meant that it is we who choose the ultimate experimental arrangement,
thereby determining when as a matter of fact there will be no
interference. (Did Heisenberg in fact believe that observables have
values when there is decoherence!?)</p>

 In this connection, it is interesting to note that in the original
formulation by Griffiths (1984) there appears no quantum state in the
decoherence functional. The role of the quantum state is so to speak
taken over by the initial projection in the history, so that the
theory can indeed be seen as a theory of transition probabilities
between projections, independent of the notion of a quantum state.
(See also Bacciagaluppi 2020, Section 3.9.) </p>

 This is the question of whether one can <em>derive</em> from within
quantum mechanics the conditions necessary to <em>discover and
practise</em> quantum mechanics itself, and thus, in Shimony&rsquo;s
(1989) words, close the epistemological circle. </p>

 Everett&rsquo;s supervisor Wheeler refused to approve Everett&rsquo;s
thesis while it did not get Bohr&rsquo;s blessing, and forced Everett
to rewrite it completely. See Osnaghi, Freitas and Freire (2009), and
also the relevant materials in Everett (2012).</p>

 The main technical hurdle (the inequivalence between the
Schr&ouml;dinger equation and the Madelung equations pointed out by
Wallstrom (1994)) has arguably finally been resolved by Derakhshani
(2017). </p>

 To clarify the distinction, think of the ground state of the hydrogen
atom as a state of definite energy. As such, it is not a probabilistic
concept, and being in the ground state can arguably be thought of as
an ontic feature of a hydrogen atom. A subjectivist interpretation of
quantum probabilities holds that the probabilities that we assign to
measurement results on the basis of this state are degrees of belief.
A QBist instead believes that there is no ontic feature of the
hydrogen atom corresponding to is ground state, and that the meaning
of the state is exhausted by its use as expressing the degrees of
belief of an agent. The first author to argue that subjectivism may be
applied also to quantum probabilities was Berkovitz in the late 1980s
(see Berkovitz 2012). See also Bacciagaluppi (2014b, 2020), who argues
that subjectivism can be applied to quantum probabilities also in the
Everett, pilot-wave, and spontaneous collapse approaches.</p>

 As long as decoherence yields only effective superselection rules, as
mentioned above in
 <a href="index-2.html#DynDec">Section 1.1</a>,
 one does not leave the framework of standard non-relativistic quantum
mechanics. Strict superselection rules require the framework of
so-called algebraic quantum mechanics, and their interpretational
status still needs to be assessed more systematically. (My thanks to
Hans Primas for discussion of this point.)</p>

 An analogy from standard quantum mechanics may be helpful here. Take
a harmonic oscillator in equilibrium with its environment. An
equilibrium state is by definition a stationary state under the
dynamics, i.e. it is itself time-independent. However, one can
decompose the equilibrium state of the oscillator as a mixture of
localised components each carrying out one of the oscillator&rsquo;s
possible (time-dependent!) classical motions. Such a decomposition can
be found e.g. in Donald (1998, Section 2).</p>

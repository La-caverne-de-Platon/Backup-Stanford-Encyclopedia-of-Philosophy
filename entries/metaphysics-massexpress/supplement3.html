<h2>Supplement 3: Non-Atomicity and Its Relevance to the Mass/Count Distinction</h2>

<p>We can call Link&rsquo;s view &ldquo;Lattice Theory&rdquo; (1998)
and Bunt&rsquo;s is called &ldquo;Ensemble Theory&rdquo;. Neither theory recommends adding non-individual
entities to the domain. Rather, in the case of Link, the notion of
individuals is construed to be non-domain specific and as extensionally
neutral as possible&mdash;&lsquo;individuals&rsquo; count as any kind of entity
whatsoever. So, the notion of &lsquo;individuals&rsquo; is expanded to include mass
and plural entities in addition to objects. In the case of Bunt normal
individuals and mass entities are both treated as individuals, which
differ in whether they are &lsquo;discrete&rsquo; or
&lsquo;continuous&rsquo;, respectively (in our terminology of 
<a href="index-2.html#SomTer">section 2.1</a>, &lsquo;heterogeneous&rsquo; or &lsquo;non-atomic&rsquo;,
respectively). </p>

<p>
Both theories are put forth in a non-metaphysical spirit, the authors
being somewhat agnostic about the real nature of the reference of mass
expressions. Part of the advantage of these approaches is that they are
most likely consistent with various metaphysical
interpretations&mdash;their proponents being in the business of
offering an economical and faithful logico-linguistic ideology rather
than offering a fleshed out or prescriptive ontology. Both accounts,
despite their seeming neutrality, cannot help but invite empirical and
metaphysical worries and objections, since they imply that the folk are
implicitly committed to matter being both infinitely divisible and distinct from the objects they constitute. Since we have previously discussed the
problems with stuff-thing or plural-thing dualisms, we will skip
discussion of the difficulties of this dualism as such. We will, however, discuss how these accounts differentiate masses from singular individuals. The difference is that
masses (as opposed to singular individuals) are non-atomic. </p>

<p>
Due to space constraints we will focus on Link. As we will use as few
technicalities as possible to get the gist of the view, we will not do
complete justice to its sophistication and nuance. </p>

<p>
Link argues that an adequate algebraic formal semantics for natural
language needs plural and mass individuals in addition to singular
ones. The argument for this is the formal fecundity of this procedure
and how the resultant system correctly demarcates valid from invalid
inferences featuring mass expressions in a consistent and explanatory
manner. </p>

<p>
Suppose we have a toy domain <em>A</em>1 with only three particular atomic
entities in it&mdash;<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>. Suppose they
each satisfy the singular predicate <em>F</em>, and have no proper parts which
are <em>F</em>. Suppose there is a join relation which combines particular
individuals to make plural individuals only (call it a plural join or
&lsquo;<em>p</em>-join&rsquo;). When we have the (non-set-theoretic and
non-mereologically interpreted) union of <em>a</em>
and <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> and <em>c</em>,
and <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>, it will be signified this
way: <em>a</em>&nbsp;&cup;<sub><em>p</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>b</em> , <em>a</em>&nbsp;&cup;<sub><em>p</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>c</em>
, <em>b</em>&nbsp;&cup;<sub><em>p</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>c</em>.  This results in an extension of domain
<em>A</em>1&mdash;call it <em>A</em>2. We can think of the <em>p</em>-join forming a lattice structure
with <em>A</em>2 on top, which contains three nodes with two connections each
to the atoms of <em>A</em>1. <em>A</em>2 contains all the plural entities which are
doubles. But, we can iterate <em>p</em>-join for a third level <em>A</em>3 in the
lattice which contains <em>a</em>&nbsp;&cup;<sub><em>p</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>b</em>&nbsp;&cup;<sub><em>p</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>c</em>, or the
triple plural entity. The singular predicate <em>F</em> will be neither
cumulative (i.e., it is not true of the joins which are <em>F</em>s, for
example, if &lsquo;<em>F</em>&rsquo; is &lsquo;Man&rsquo;, and <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> are each a man, then the
plural individual <em>a</em>&nbsp;&cup;<sub><em>p</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>b</em> is not a man), nor is it
distributive over the proper parts of the atoms of <em>A</em>1 (more on this
later). Call the plural predicate of <em>F</em> &lsquo;<em>F</em>*&rsquo;. <em>F</em>* will be
distributive over all non-terminal nodes or joins of individuals in <em>A</em>1
on up which are not single <em>F</em>s but are composed of Fs. <em>F</em>* will also be
cumulative on up the lattice for any joins of <em>F</em>s. This system is nice
and tidy and is extended so that we can say what we want to about
plural and singular entities and their relations. Certain predicates
of plural joins will be stipulated to be non-distributive, such as
&lsquo;form a circle,&rsquo; while others are seen to be
systematically ambiguous, such as &lsquo;carry&rsquo; (e.g., &ldquo;the
students carried furniture&rdquo;) which can, when applied to plural joins,
be either distributive or not, depending on the disambiguation. </p>

<p>
We can then construct a domain <em>B</em> out of <em>A</em>1 and assume it contains a
subsystem of mass entities which contains all of the stuff which makes
up<em> a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>. On our initial
assumption <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> are the only
singular individuals in <em>A</em>1. So the stuff making
up <em>a&ndash;c</em> is not a singular individual or composed of
singular entities. The entities in <em>B</em> are then related to those in <em>A</em>1
on up by various mapping functions or homomorphisms (e.g., &lsquo;the
stuff of <em>a</em>&rsquo;, which we can refer to by
&ldquo;<em>a<sub>s</sub></em>&rdquo;).  We can also formulate a different join
relationship, or <em>s</em>-join, which holds between different stuff portions,
such as the stuff which makes up <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, which
we could indicate as <em>a<sub>s</sub></em>&nbsp;&cup;<sub><em>s</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>b<sub>s</sub></em>. This allows us to
develop an additional lattice structure alongside that of the plural
individuals.  Predicates of the mass individuals can be tagged as
either distributive or cumulative, based on our inferential
use. If <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> are all spatially
extended and made up of the same kind of completely homogenous and
non-atomistic stuff <em>K</em>, then if &lsquo;is-<em>K</em>&rsquo; is true of the mass
individuals <em>a<sub>s</sub></em> and <em>b<sub>s</sub></em>, then it will be true of their join, as well as
true of every proper part of all joins and mass individuals that we
started with.  These distinctions also help us model each
disambiguation of sentences such as &ldquo;Mephistopheles passed the
potatoes.&rdquo; </p>

<p>
One important point to note is that the various part-relationships
(each of which forms a partial ordering) in the singular, plural, and
mass individual domains do not carry across domains. Call the
&lsquo;part-of&rsquo; relation in the plural domain
&lsquo;<em>pp</em>&lt;&rsquo;, in the stuff domain &lsquo;<em>s</em>&lt;&rsquo;. The
stuff of <em>a</em> is part of the join of the stuff
of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> (<em>a<sub>s</sub></em>
<em>s</em>&lt; <em>a<sub>s</sub></em>&nbsp;&cup;<sub><em>s</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>b<sub>s</sub></em>), but the stuff of <em>a</em> is not a
<em>pp</em>-part of <em>a</em>&nbsp;&cup;<sub><em>p</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>b</em>, nor is the plural individual<em>
a</em>&nbsp;&cup;<sub><em>p</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>b</em> an <em>s</em>-part
of <em>a<sub>s</sub></em>&nbsp;&cup;<sub><em>s</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>b<sub>s</sub></em>&nbsp;&cup;<sub><em>s</em></sub>&nbsp;<em>c<sub>s</sub></em>. Furthermore, the stuff
of <em>a</em> is not an improper <em>s</em>- or <em>pp</em>-part of <em>a</em> either,
since the stuff of <em>a</em> is stipulated to be distinct
from <em>a</em>. </p>

<p>
These multifarious part relationships give us certain advantages. On
classical extensional mereology, if two entities have all the same
proper parts, then they are identical. So, since a puddle and its water
have the same parts, then they are identical. But then, either the
puddle can survive evaporation or the water cannot. These problems
arise largely from assuming that the domain of predication is
&lsquo;flat&rsquo;, which is to say that all the entities are of the
same kind, e.g., singular/particular individuals, and that predicates
(&lsquo;part-of&rsquo; predicates included) which apply to a singular
individual also apply to the stuff making it up. But Link&rsquo;s
system distinguishes different kinds of individuals, so that we can
comprehensibly assert of two entities with all the same proper parts,
such as a ring and its constituent gold, that the ring is new, whereas
the gold is old. This also allows us to differentiate between, for
instance, a committee (singular individual), some members of the
committee (plural individual), and the matter making them up (mass
individual). Any comprehensive treatment of mass, plural, and singular
individuals will need to differentiate between the different ways
concepts chop up the entire domain of discourse, or, so to speak, lay
down different matrices which allow predicates to apply to entities at
one level of the lattice (e.g., hydrogen) but not others (e.g., gas
bubble), and Link accounts for all this (cf. the notion of &lsquo;covering&rsquo; in Gillon 1992, 1996; Nicolas 2008). Of course, this account entails
coincidence, which Link happily endorses, since the proliferation of
entities, although strange, is supported by our language use, which
&ldquo;seems to function that way&rdquo; (1998, p.&thinsp;16). Link&rsquo;s
argument for this is somewhat peremptory:</p>

<blockquote><p> if we have, for instance, two expressions a and b that
refer to entities occupying the same place at the same time but have
different sets of predicates applying to them, then the entities
referred to are simply not the same. From this it follows that my ring
and the gold making up my ring are different entities. (1998, p.&thinsp;16) </p></blockquote>

<p>
If these entities are metaphysically distinguished in a strong manner,
then Link&rsquo;s theory will inherit all of the problems of
coincidence mentioned above, the ontological oddness of which
undermines the appeal of the formal elegance. </p>

<p>
Problems arise from the contention that what distinguishes mass
individuals from singular and plural ones is that mass entities have no
smallest parts&mdash;&ldquo;The denotations of mass terms like water
are quantities. They differ from pluralities in that they don&rsquo;t
have smallest parts.&rdquo; This is very strange, since modern science
tells us that water does have smallest parts&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>O
molecules. How can formal semantics inform us of the structure of
matter? At the best it can inform us of how language users believe
matter is structured. Link almost never, and certainly never
convincingly, argues that stuffs have no smallest parts, and certainly
not that stuff is necessarily non-atomic. But, in Link&rsquo;s defense,
he never intended his semantics to tell us what the structure of matter
is. He is intending to give us a good semantic representation, and
</p><blockquote><p>
a semantic representation usually gives no more than a model of
the phenomena to be described, and there is no claim about the
&lsquo;real nature&rsquo; of the things in the domain of
discourse. (1998, p.&thinsp;190) </p></blockquote>

<p>
His defense of the treatment of mass terms as being non-atomic is as
follows. Many of our inferences featuring mass terms are distributive,
which implies that stuffs are infinitely divisible and have no
smallest parts according to the correct semantic modeling. Our talk of
singular and &lsquo;plural individuals&rsquo; is not distributive. So,
if we want to give the right formal semantics to model our language
use, we ought to do so in a way which attributes to mass entities the
properties the folk imply they have. The right way to validate folk
inferences with regards to masses is to model them as non-atomic (see
1998, pp.&thinsp;189&ndash;90). Since Link&rsquo;s project is to develop formal
semantics and not lay down metaphysics, then the best route to go is
to lay down the most accurate formal semantics for our use, and if it
seems to imply that reality is a certain way that maybe it is not,
then so be it. </p>

<p>
However, it is questionable that the folk and their use of mass
expressions (at the macroscopic level) commit them to a view regarding
atomicity. Laycock, for instance, states that folk usage shows that we
are implicitly committed to an atomic theory of matter, whereas others
(e.g., Gillon 1992), perhaps more plausibly, argue that the folk and their
mass expression use often underdetermines whether the reference of mass
expressions are atomic or not.[cite] Ancient Greeks philosophers, for instance, can
be seen to go either way. </p>

<p>
Against the contention of the non-atomist, there are many atomic mass
terms. &lsquo;Furniture&rsquo; and &lsquo;silverware&rsquo; are both
mass and atomic. The folk use many mass terms, such as
&lsquo;hair&rsquo; or &lsquo;fur&rsquo;, which they <em>know</em> has individual
parts&mdash;individual hairs. Against the atomist, there are also count
terms which are non-atomic (see Nicolas 2002 and 2004). Aggregates can have other aggregates as parts. One of the Pope&rsquo;s crowns is made up of crowns. A pregnant bird can have a bird as part of it. Geometrical plane figures have plane
figures as parts. </p>

<p>
It is unfortunate perhaps that Link makes so much of the supposed
non-atomicity of stuffs, but it is built into the semantics and lattice
structure in such a way that if the non-atomic postulation is dropped,
then the framework would have to be re-worked completely. If Link
allows stuffs to be atomic, then there is nothing to distinguish them
from singular entities. Hence the domain would become
&lsquo;flatter&rsquo;, and Link would have to give up some of his
account&rsquo;s distinctives. </p>

<p>
Developing a formally satisfactory, descriptive theory of mass terms
whose formal structure&rsquo;s commitments is in tension with empirical
theory, such as Bunt and Link do, has its drawbacks. This requires
doing the semantics twice over, if we have reason to believe the world
is not as the folk believe it to be. As Koslicki puts it, </p>

<blockquote><p>Bunt suggests that nouns that
standardly have mass-occurrences allow us to speak of things they apply
to as if these were infinitely divisible, even if, as a matter of
empirical fact, they are not&hellip;But this approach requires two
levels of semantic theory: one level is, as Bunt would put it,
&lsquo;purely linguistic&rsquo; and has nothing to do with the
real-world referents of our words. The other incorporates facts
concerning the actual referents, such as the fact that water actually
consists of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules. (1999, fn. 41)</p></blockquote>

<p>
It seems that accounts like Link&rsquo;s and Bunt&rsquo;s require us to
either ignore empirical atomicity of stuffs or to postulate a bridge
between the two-level analyses so that the non-atomicity of the formal
algebra can be linked with the atomicity of stuffs in the world. So, we
must either be empirical ostriches or do our semantics twice over. </p>

<p>
One line of defense that Link and Bunt could take is to claim that
properties such as &lsquo;being some water&rsquo; are sometimes
relational. That is, water is water all the way through, regardless of
atomic theory. This is because to be some water is either to be a water
molecule, a collection of them, or a proper part or sum of proper parts
of a water molecule. An electron, for instance, in a H<sub>2</sub>O
molecule is also some water, in virtue of its contributing to the
realization of a water molecule. A blueberry in a fruitcake is some
fruitcake. This might seem extravagant, but it can be motivated by the
resulting account&rsquo;s problem-solving power. Note that while this
might be plausible or at least somewhat motivated for concrete mass
nouns, it is implausible for concrete quasi-mass nouns such as
&lsquo;furniture&rsquo; or &lsquo;cutlery&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
While this was not their goal, it is clear that some metaphysicians
might motivate a distinction between things and stuff by appealing to
the formal work of Bunt and Link. It is not
clear, however, whether the formal fecundity of this approach does
sufficiently motivate this kind of view.</p>

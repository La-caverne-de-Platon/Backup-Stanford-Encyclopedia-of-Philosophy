<h3><a id="JMKey">1. J.M. Keynes</a></h3>

<p>In his <em>Treatise on Probability</em> Keynes argued that
&ldquo;probabilities&rdquo; needn&rsquo;t always be amenable to numerical
comparisons <span class="citation">(Keynes 1921)</span>. He said:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>[N]o exercise of the practical judgment is possible, by which a
numerical value can actually be given to the probability of every
argument. So far from our being able to measure them, it is not even
clear that we are always able to place them in an order of
magnitude. Nor has any theoretical rule for their evaluation ever been
suggested. The doubt, in view of these facts, whether any two
probabilities are in every case even theoretically capable of
comparison in terms of numbers, has not, however, received serious
consideration. There seems to me to be exceedingly strong reasons for
entertaining the doubt. <span class="citation">(Keynes 1921:
29)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

<p>I maintain &hellip; that there are some pairs of probabilities
between the members of which <em>no</em> comparison of magnitude is
possible; that we can say, nevertheless, of some pairs of relations of
probability that the one is greater and the other less, although it is
not possible to measure the difference between them; and that in a
very special type of case &hellip; a meaning can be given to
a <em>numerical</em> comparison of
magnitude. <span class="citation">(Keynes 1921: 36, Keynes&rsquo;
emphasis)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keynes&rsquo; <em>Theory of Probability</em> contains the diagram
reproduced in <a href="#fig3">Figure H1</a>, and it&rsquo;s clear from this
that he thought there could be degrees of belief that were not
numerically comparable. Keynes interprets the <i>O</i> and <i>I</i> as
the contradiction and tautology respectively and <i>A</i> is a
proposition with a numerically measurable probability. The lines
connect those propositions (denoted by letters) that can be
compared. So <i>V</i> and <i>W</i> can be compared and <i>W</i> is
more likely that <i>V</i> (since it is closer to <i>I</i>). Those
propositions without lines between them (for example <i>X</i>
and <i>Y</i>) are incomparable. Keynes&rsquo; own discussion of the diagram
is on page 42 of <span class="citation">Keynes (1921)</span>.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig3">
<img src="keynes.png" alt="[A line with endpoints 'O' and 'I' and a point about two-thirds of the way from 'O' to 'I' labeled 'A'.  A wide curve above the line goes from 'O' to 'I' with a point partway labeled 'U'.  A second curve below the first also goes from 'O' to 'I' and has points 'V', 'W', and 'X' marked on it.  A third curve initial starts between the first and second curves at 'O' but intersects the second curve at 'W' and goes below before ending also at 'I'; a point 'Z' is marked on the first part of this curve and a point 'X' on the second part.  A last curve connects points 'V' on the second curve and point 'A' on the line.]" />
<p class="center"><span class="figlabel">Figure H1:</span> Keynes&rsquo; view of probability</p>
</div>

<p><span class="citation">Weatherson (2002)</span> interprets Keynes
as favouring some sort of IP view since sets of functions (or
intervals of values) naturally give rise to the sorts of
incomparabilities that Keynes takes to be features of belief. Keynes
took (conditional) probability to be a sort of logical relationship
that held between propositions <span class="citation">(H&aacute;jek 2011:
3.2)</span>, rather than as strength of belief. So whether Keynes
would have approved of IP models is
unclear. See <span class="citation">Kyburg (2003)</span> for a
discussion of Keynes&rsquo; view by someone sympathetic to IP,
and see <span class="citation">Brady and Arthmar (2012)</span> for further discussion of Kaynes&rsquo; view.</p>

<h3><a id="IJGoo">2. I.J. Good</a></h3>

<p>I.J. Good, mathematician, statistician, student of G.H. Hardy and
Bletchley Park code-breaker, was an early advocate of something like
IP.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In principle these [probability] axioms should be used in
conjunction with inequality judgements and therefore only lead to
inequality discernments&hellip; Most subjective probabilities are
regarded as belonging only to some interval of
values. <span class="citation">(Good 1983 [1971]: 15)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good is usually associated with the &ldquo;black box model of
belief&rdquo;. The idea here is that at the core of your epistemic
state is a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; which you cannot look inside. The
black box outputs &ldquo;discernments&rdquo;: qualitative probability
judgements like &ldquo;\(X\) is more likely
than \(Y\)&rdquo;. The idea is that inside the
black box there is a numerical and precise probability function that
you only have indirect and imperfect access
to <span class="citation">(Good 1962)</span>.</p>

<p>It isn&rsquo;t wholly clear from Good&rsquo;s writings on this topic whether
the precise probability in the black box is supposed to be a genuine
part of an agent&rsquo;s epistemic state or whether talk of the precise
black box probability is just a calculational device. Good is often
interpreted as being in the former camp (by Levi for example), but the
following quote suggests he might have been in the latter camp:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It is often convenient to forget about the inequality for the sake
of simplicity and to simply use precise
estimates. <span class="citation">(Good 1983 [1971]: 16)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The way Good talks in
his <span class="citation">(1962)</span>&mdash;especially around page
77&mdash;also suggests that Good&rsquo;s view isn&rsquo;t quite the &ldquo;black
box&rdquo; interpretation that is attributed to him. In any case, Good
is certainly interpreted as holding the view that IP is required since
belief is only imperfectly available to introspection.</p>

<h3><a id="IsaLev">3. Isaac Levi</a></h3>

<p>Isaac Levi has been a prominent defender of a particular brand of
IP since the seventies <span class="citation">(Levi 1974, 1980, 1985,
1986)</span>. Levi&rsquo;s brand of IP is developed carefully and thoroughly
over the course of several books and articles, the most important
being <em>The Enterprise of
Knowledge</em> <span class="citation">(Levi 1980)</span> and <em>Hard
Choices</em> <span class="citation">(Levi 1986)</span>. Levi has
several motivations for being dissatisfied with the precise
probabilistic orthodoxy. One of Levi&rsquo;s motivations for IP is captured
by the following quote:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>[I]t is sometimes rational to make no determinate probability
judgement and, indeed, to make maximally indeterminate
judgements. Here I am supposing &hellip; that refusal to make a
determinate probability judgement does not derive from a lack of
clarity about one&rsquo;s credal state. To the contrary, it may derive from
a very clear and cool judgement that on the basis of the available
evidence, making a numerically determinate judgement would be
unwarranted and arbitrary. <span class="citation">(Levi 1985:
396)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another motivation for Levi&rsquo;s brand of IP is connected to his
general picture of the structure of an agent&rsquo;s mental state at a
time. Levi&rsquo;s view is that your belief state at a time can be captured
by two components. The first component is your <em>Corpus of
Knowledge</em>, \(K\), which &ldquo;encodes
the set of sentences &hellip; to whose certain truth [you are]
committed&rdquo; <span class="citation">(Levi 1974:
395)</span>. \(K\) is a deductively closed set
of sentences. In any model of partial belief and uncertain inference,
there are some things about which you are uncertain. But in every case
there are some things that are taken for granted. Imagine a toy
example of drawing marbles from an urn. The observed frequencies of
colours is used as evidence to infer something about the frequencies
of colours in the urn. In this model, you take for granted that you
are accurately recognising the colours and are not being deceived by
an evil demon or anything like that (or, more prosaically, that the
draws are probabilistically independent of each other and each draw has the
same probabilities associated with it, i.e. that the draws are 
independent and identically distributed, i.i.d.). 
That&rsquo;s not to say that we couldn&rsquo;t model a situation where
there was some doubt about the observations: the point is that in the
simple case, that sort of funny business is just ruled out. &ldquo;No
funny business&rdquo; is in \(K\), if you
like. There are certain aspects of the situation that are taken for
granted: that are outside the modelling process. This is the same in
science: when we model the load stress of a particular design of
bridge, we take for granted the basic physics of rigid bodies and the
facts about the materials involved.</p>

<p>The second part of Levi&rsquo;s view of your belief state is captured by
your <em>confirmational commitments</em> which describe how you are
disposed to change your belief in response to certain kinds of
evidence. \(C\) is a function that takes your
corpus \(K\) as input and outputs &ldquo;your
beliefs&rdquo;: some object that informs your decision making
behaviour and constrains how your attitudes change in response to
evidence. Levi argues in favour of this bipartite epistemology as
follows:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>One of the advantages of introducing confirmational commitments is
that confirmational commitments and states of full belief can vary
independently without incoherence&hellip; [T]he separability of
confirmational commitment and state of full belief is important to the
study of conditions under which changes in credal state are
justified. If this separability is ignored and attention is focused on
changes in credal state directly, the distinction between changes in
credal state that are changes in confirmational commitment and changes
in full belief is suppressed without
argument. <span class="citation">(Levi 1999: 515)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Levi sees precise Bayesianism as suppressing this distinction. The
only way a Bayesian agent updates is through conditionalisation. Levi
has more to say on the subject of the defects of Bayesianism, but we
don&rsquo;t have room to discuss his criticisms.</p>

<p>For Levi, the output of \(C(K)\) is a set
of probability functions, \(P\), with the
following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>\(P\) is non-empty.</li>
<li>\(P\) is convex, meaning if \(p,q\in P\) then for \(0 \ge \lambda\ge 1\), \(\lambda p + (1-\lambda) q \in P\).</li>
<li>If you learn \(E\) with certainty and nothing else, then \(C(K+E) = Q\) where \(Q = \{p(\cdot \mid E)\}\).</li>
</ul>

<p>The first and third of these properties shouldn&rsquo;t strike anyone as
particularly surprising or unusual. The second, however, needs further
comment. Recall that Levi thought that sets of probabilities were
useful as a way of representing conflict. If you are conflicted
between \(p\)
and \(q\) (represented by both being in your
representor) then any convex combination
of \(p\) and \(q\)
will:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>have all the earmarks of potential resolutions of the conflict;
and, given the assumption that one should not preclude potential
resolutions when suspending judgement between rival systems&hellip;
all weighted averages of the two [probability] functions are thus
taken into account. <span class="citation">(Levi 1980:
192)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Levi&rsquo;s reasons for taking linear averages of precise credal states
(and only linear averages) to be particularly pertinent as resolutions
of conflict aren&rsquo;t particularly clearly spelled out. Levi does appeal
to a theorem from <span class="citation">Blackwell and Girschick
(1954)</span> and to Harsanyi&rsquo;s
theorem <span class="citation">(Harsanyi 1955)</span> as reasons to
think that conflicts in values (utility functions) should be resolved
through linear averaging <span class="citation">(Levi 1980: 175; Levi
1986: 78)</span>. The premises of these arguments are not particularly
discussed or justified in Levi&rsquo;s set up. The argument for <em>credal
convexity</em> is less clear, but see <span class="citation">(Levi
1980: chap. 9)</span>. A further puzzle for Levi&rsquo;s view is that these
potential resolutions of conflict might not respect probabilistic
independencies that \(p\)
and \(q\) agree on
(see <a href="index-2.html#GroBel">section 2.7</a>)</p>

<h3><a id="HenKyb">4. Henry Kyburg</a></h3>

<p>Henry Kyburg&rsquo;s view on rational belief bears some similarities to
Levi&rsquo;s (both were students of Ernest Nagel). Both take there to be
some corpus of knowledge \(K\)&mdash;Kyburg&rsquo;s
term is <em>Evidential Corpus</em>&mdash;which is part of what
determines your credal state. However, Kyburg&rsquo;s <em>Evidential
Probabilities</em> are quite different to Levi&rsquo;s picture of rational
belief.</p>

<p>Kyburg&rsquo;s \(K\) is a collection of sentences
of a logical language that includes the expressive resources to say
things like &ldquo;the proportion of \(F\)s
that are \(G\)s is
between \(l\)
and \(u\)&rdquo;. Such evidential corpora are
indexed by a significance level at which the claims in the corpus are
valid. Levi doesn&rsquo;t say a great deal about how the confirmational
commitment \(C\) constrains your credal state
except to say that if \(X\) is a sentence
in \(K\) then if \(p \in
C(K)\) then \(p(X)=1\). Kyburg has a lot
more to say about this step. He develops a set of rules for dealing
with conflicts of information in the corpus.</p>

<p>Evidential probabilities are a kind of
&ldquo;interval-valued&rdquo; probability together with a thorough
theory for inferring them from statistical data, and for logically
reasoning about them. The intervals aren&rsquo;t necessarily interpretable
as sets of probability functions: that is, they can violate some of
the properties of credal sets discussed in the formal appendix. The
theory is most fully set out in <span class="citation">Kyburg and Teng
(2001)</span> (see also, <span class="citation">Wheeler and Williamson
(2011)</span>; <span class="citation">Haenni et
al. (2011)</span>). The theory is discussed more with an eye to the
concerns of psychologists and experimental economists
in <span class="citation">Kyburg (1983)</span>.</p>

<h3><a id="SIPCom">5. The SIPTA community</a></h3>

<p>Drawing on the work of Bruno de Finetti, C.A.B. Smith and Peter
Williams, there is a rich tradition of IP research that culminates in
the body of work developed by those associated with SIPTA: the Society
for Imprecise Probability, Theory and Applications
(<a href="http://www.sipta.org/" target="other">http://www.sipta.org/</a>).
 SIPTA only came into being
in 2002, and the ISIPTA conferences have only been running since 1999,
but one can trace a common thread of research back much further. Among
the important works contributing to this tradition
are: <span class="citation">Fine
(1973)</span>, <span class="citation">Suppes
(1974)</span>, <span class="citation">Williams
(1976)</span>, <span class="citation">Walley and Fine
(1982)</span>, <span class="citation">Kyburg
(1987)</span>, <span class="citation">Seidenfeld
(1988)</span>, <span class="citation">Walley
(1991)</span>, <span class="citation">Kadane, Schervish, and
Seidenfeld (1999)</span>, <span class="citation">de Cooman and Miranda
(2007)</span>, <span class="citation">Troffaes and de Cooman
(2014)</span> and <span class="citation">Augustin et
al. (2014)</span>. One main strand of work in this tradition is
outlined in the
 <a href="supplement-formal.html">formal appendix</a>.
 See <span class="citation">Miranda (2008)</span> for a
recent survey of some work in this tradition,
and <span class="citation">Augustin et al. (2014)</span> for a book
length introduction. A recent comment on the history of imprecise
probabilities can be found in <span class="citation">Vicig and
Seidenfeld (2012)</span>. Work in what I am calling the &ldquo;SIPTA
tradition&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t just focussed on IP as a model of rational
belief, but on IP as a useful tool in statistics and other disciplines
as well: IP as a model of some non-deterministic process, IP as a tool
for classification of data&hellip;</p>

<p>The popularity of the term &ldquo;Imprecise Probability&rdquo; for
the class of models we are interested in is due, in large part, to the
influence of Peter Walley&rsquo;s 1991 book <em>Statistical Reasoning with
Imprecise Probabilities</em>. This book was, until very recently, the
most complete description of the theory of imprecise
probabilities. Walley brought together and extended the above
mentioned results and produced a rich and deep theory of statistics on
the basis of IP. Despite being mainly devoted to the exposition of the
formal machinery of IP, Walley&rsquo;s book contains a lot of interesting
material on the philosophical foundations of IP. In particular,
sections 1.3&ndash;1.7, the sections on the interpretation of IP
(2.10, 2.11), and chapter 5 all contain interesting philosophical
discussion that in many ways anticipates recent philosophical debates
on IP. It wouldn&rsquo;t be uncharitable to describe a lot of recent
philosophical work on IP as footnotes to Walley (although referencing
Walley in a footnote appears to be as close as some authors get to
actually engaging with him). Engagement by philosophers with this
community has sadly been rather limited, excepting Levi, Kyburg and
their students. This is unfortunate since many philosophically rich
topics emerge in the course of this sort of research, for example, the
many distinct independence concepts for
IP <span class="citation">(Kyburg and Pittarelli 1992; Cozman and
Walley 2005; Cozman 2012)</span>, the rational requirements on group
belief <span class="citation">(Seidenfeld, Kadane, and Schervish
1989)</span> or the distinction between symmetries in the model and
models constrained to satisfy certain
symmetries <span class="citation">(de Cooman and Miranda
2007)</span>.</p>

<h3><a id="RicJef">6. Richard Jeffrey</a></h3>

<p>Richard Jeffrey is sometimes taken to be someone whose views are
consonant with the IP tradition. In reality, Jeffrey&rsquo;s view is a
little more complicated. In <em>The Logic of
Decision</em> <span class="citation">(Jeffrey 1983)</span>, Jeffrey
develops a representation theorem based on mathematical work by Ethan
Bolker that uses premises that are interestingly weaker than those of
Savage&rsquo;s classic theorem <span class="citation">(Savage 1972
[1954])</span>. Agents still have complete and transitive preferences,
but they have those preferences over a space where the
&ldquo;belief&rdquo; and &ldquo;value&rdquo; parts aren&rsquo;t
straightforwardly separable. In Savage&rsquo;s theorem, in contrast, the
&ldquo;states&rdquo; and &ldquo;outcomes&rdquo; are distinct
spaces. The representation that arises in Jeffrey&rsquo;s framework is not
unique, in the following sense. If \((p,v)\)
is a probability-utility representation of the preference relation,
then there exists a \(\lambda\) such
that \((p&#39;,v&#39;)\) also represents the
preference, where \(p&#39;\)
and \(v&#39;\) are defined as:</p>

\[\begin{align}
p'(X) &amp;= p(X)[1-\lambda v(X)] \\
v'(X) &amp;= v(X)[(1+\lambda)/(1+\lambda v(X))]
\end{align}\]

<p>Indeed, there will be infinitely many such
representations <span class="citation">(Jeffrey 1983: chap. 8; Joyce
1999: 133&ndash;5)</span>. Jeffrey argued that an epistemology built
on such a representation theorem gives</p>
<blockquote>

<p>one clear version of Bayesianism in which belief states&hellip; are
naturally identified with infinite sets of probability functions, so
that degrees of belief in particular propositions will normally be
determined only up to an appropriate quantization, i.e., they will be
interval-valued (so to speak). <span class="citation">(Jeffrey
1984)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeffrey claims that his theory subsumes Levi&rsquo;s
theory. <span class="citation">Levi (1985)</span> responds that his
theory and Jeffrey&rsquo;s are importantly distinct,
and <span class="citation">Jeffrey (1987)</span> recants.</p>

<p>This aspect of Jeffrey&rsquo;s work&mdash;the Jeffrey-Bolker
representation theorem&mdash;cannot be taken as a basis for imprecise
probabilities in the sense we are considering. Jeffrey notes this
point:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>[T]he indeterminacy of [\(p\)] and
[\(v\)] that is implied by Bolker&rsquo;s uniqueness
theorem takes place within a context of total determinacy about
preference and indifference. Thus it has nothing to do with the
decision-theoretical questions that Levi
addresses. <span class="citation">(Jeffrey 1987: 590)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The indeterminacy of the belief in this setting is due to the
inseparability of the beliefs and the values (as captured by the above
mentioned alternative representations). However, Jeffrey also takes a
line that is more IP-friendly. He says:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I do not take belief states to be determined by full preference
rankings of rich Boolean algebras of propositions, for our actual
preference rankings are fragmentary&hellip; [E]ven if my theory were
like Savage&rsquo;s in that full rankings of whole algebras always determine
unique probability functions, the actual partial rankings that
characterize real people would determine belief states that are
infinite sets of probability functions on the full
algebras. <span class="citation">(Jeffrey 1984: 139)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeffrey&rsquo;s main concern in his 1984 paper is with scientific
reasoning, and with a solution to the Problem of Old Evidence
originally introduced by <span class="citation">Glymour
(1980)</span>. However, with respect to decision theory, he seems much
less certain of the role of IP. In places, Jeffrey seems to agree with
Levi:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Where the agent&rsquo;s attitudes are characterized by a set
of \([(p,v)]\) pairs, some of which give one
ranking of the options and some another, I see decision theory as
silent&hellip; I don&rsquo;t think that to count as rational you always have
to have definite preferences or indifferences, any more than you
always have to have precise probabilistic judgments. Nor does
Levi. <span class="citation">(Jeffrey 1987: 589)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeffrey here seems to be suggesting that IP is at least
permissible. However, he ends up thinking that applying the principle
of indifference (in some form) is a legitimate way to &ldquo;sharpen
up&rdquo; your beliefs and values (and thus your preferences). After
likening his position to Kaplan&rsquo;s&mdash;see section 2.2&mdash;Jeffrey says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I differ from Kaplan, who would see my adoption of the uniform
distribution as unjustifiable precision, whereas I think I would adopt
it as a precise characterization of my uncertainty. Having more hopes
for locally definite judgmental probabilities than Levi does, I am
less dedicated to judgmental sets [of probabilities] as
characterizations of uncertainty&hellip; I attribute less
psychological immediacy than Levi does to sets of judgemental
probability functions; and in decision theory, where he assigns them a
central systematic role, I use them peripherally and <em>ad
hoc</em>. <span class="citation">(1987: 589)</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In summary then, Jeffrey sides with Levi with respect to
epistemology&mdash;modulo the emphasis on permissibility rather than
obligation&mdash;but has a more orthodox view of decision theory. So
care must be taken when appealing to Jeffrey as an advocate of IP. 
<span class="citation">Richard Bradley (2017)</span> develops an IP-friendly version of decision theory that is clearly inspired by the work of Richard Jeffrey.</p>

<h3><a id="ArtDemGleSha">7. Arthur Dempster and Glenn Shafer</a></h3>

<p>Dempster&ndash;Shafer belief theory builds a theory of rational
belief on an infinite monotone
capacity \(bel\) and its
conjugate \(plaus(X) = 1-bel(\neg X)\) (see
the <a href="supplement-formal.html">formal appendix</a>).
 \(bel(X)\) is interpreted as
the degree to which your evidence
supports \(X\). The interesting aspect of DS
theory is its method for <em>combining</em> different bodies of
evidence. So if \(bel_1\) represents the
degree to which a certain body of evidence supports various hypotheses
and \(bel_2\) captures the degree of support
of another body of evidence, then DS theory gives you a method for
working out the degree to which the combination of the evidence
supports hypotheses. This is a distinct process from
conditionalisation which also has an analogue in DS
theory <span class="citation">(see Kyburg 1987 for discussion of the
difference)</span>. In any case, DS theory can be, in a sense,
subsumed within the credal sets approach, since every DS belief
function is the lower envelope of some set of
probabilities <span class="citation">(Theorem 2.4.1 on p.34 of Halpern
2003)</span>. Discussing the details would take us too far afield, so
I point the interested reader to the following
references: <span class="citation">(Halpern 2003: 32&ndash;40,
92&ndash;5; Kyburg and Teng 2001: 104&ndash;12; Haenni 2009:
132&ndash;47; Huber 2014: section 3.1)</span>.</p>

<h3><a id="PetGrdNilEriSah">8. Peter G&auml;rdenfors and Nils-Eric Sahlin</a></h3>

<p><span class="citation">G&auml;rdenfors and Sahlin (1982)</span>
introduce a theory that they term <em>Unreliable
Probabilities</em> <span class="citation">(the theory builds on
G&auml;rdenfors 1979)</span>. It bears some resemblance to Kyburg&rsquo;s
theory&mdash;they in fact discuss Kyburg&mdash;but it is a theory
built with decision making in mind. The basic idea is that you have a
set of probabilities and attached to each probability function is an
indicator of its reliability. Depending on the circumstances, you pick
some reliability threshold \(\rho\) and
restrict your attention to the set of probabilities that are at least
as reliable as that threshold. They then have a story about how
decision making should go with this set. Note that they don&rsquo;t really
need a <em>measure</em> of reliability, all they need is something
to <em>order</em> the probabilities
in \(P\). The threshold then becomes some
cut-off probability: anything less reliable than it doesn&rsquo;t make the
cut.</p>

<p><span class="citation">G&auml;rdenfors and Sahlin (1982)</span>
don&rsquo;t really discuss this measure of reliability a great
deal. Presumably reliability increases as evidence comes in that
supports that probability function. G&auml;rdenfors and Sahlin offer
an example to illustrate how reliability is supposed to work. They
consider three tennis matches. In match \(A\), you know that the two
tennis players are of roughly the same level and that it will be a
tight match. In match \(B\), you have never even heard of either
player and so cannot judge whether or not they are well matched. In
match \(C\) you have heard that the players are really unevenly
matched: one player is much better than the other, but you do not know
which of the players is significantly better. If we graphed
reliability of a probability against how likely that probability
thinks it is that the player serving first will win, the graphs would
be as follows: graph \(A\) would be very sharply peaked about \(0.5\);
graph \(B\) would be quite spread out; graph \(C\) would be a sort of
&ldquo;U&rdquo; shape with high reliability at both ends, lower in the
middle. See <a href="#fig4">Figure H2</a>.  Graph \(A\) is peaked
because you know that the match will be close. You have reliable
information that the player serving has about a 50% chance of
winning. Graph \(B\) is spread out because you have no such
information in this case. In case \(C\), you know that the probability
functions that put the chances at near 50-50 are unreliable: all you
know is that the match will be one-sided.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig4">
<img src="unreliable-graphs.png" width="400" alt="[three graphs each showing just the first quadrant.  The first labeled 'A' has a dotted line depicting a bell curve, the second labeled 'B' has a dotted straight horizontal line, and the third labeled 'C' has an upside down bell curve.]"/>

<p class="center"><span class="figlabel">Figure H2:</span> Graphs of reliability against probability server wins point</p>
</div>

<p>In summary, the unreliable probabilities approach enriches a credal
set with a <em>reliability index</em>. See <span class="citation">Levi
(1982)</span> for a critical discussion of unreliable
probabilities. <span class="citation">Cattaneo (2008)</span> gives
some content to the reliability index of a probability by interpreting
it in terms of the likelihood of the evidence given by that
probability.
Another formal theory that seems inspired by the reliability approach is that of <span class="citation">Brian Hill (2013).</span></p>

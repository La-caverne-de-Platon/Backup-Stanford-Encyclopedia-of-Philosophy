<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Medieval Political Philosophy</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 There is no true consensus on what period of time medieval philosophy
spans. See the entry on
 <a href="../medieval-philosophy/index.html#Boundaries">medieval philosophy</a> 
 (&sect;1).
 In some recent accounts, traditionally medieval figures such as
Augustine and Boethius have come to be counted as authors of late
antiquity. See the articles of Catapano, Magee, and Gersh in Gerson
2010. One
recent solution has been to refer to the Long Middle Ages, which
stresses continuity over discrete periodization, and which extends
between about 200 and 1700; for this, see Marenbon 2012: 6&ndash;7 or
his inaugural lecture (2011). This article cleaves to a more
traditional chronological span; and, furthermore, Augustine remains an
important source and touchstone for medieval political thought.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 This article thus prescinds from surveying developments in medieval
Islamic and Jewish political thought (but see Parens and Macfarland
2011 for translations of some texts in those traditions). The other
crucial lacuna is a sustained examination of medieval jurists, who
furnished and discussed many fundamental ideas of both then and today.
Valuable recent overviews are Pennington 2007 and Ryan 2015. Lee 2016: ch.
1&ndash;3 foregrounds the medieval civilian contributions to the
notions of sovereignty and constitutionalism; see also Canning 2011: ch. 5.</p>

 A university was a guild (i.e., trade association) of masters or
students in a town. The university was not itself a teaching
institution: teaching was done in the masters&rsquo; schools (or later
in colleges). Schools of higher education had existed among the
Greeks, Jews and Muslims, but a trade association of teachers or
scholars was a new idea. Like the ancient schools, the medieval
schools taught by means of text books:
 <a href="../aristotle/index.html">Aristotle</a>
 in the Arts faculty, Averroes and 
<a href="../ibn-sina/index.html">Avicenna</a> in medicine,
the Bible and the <em>Sentences</em> of Peter Lombard in theology,
Justinian in the schools of civil law, and Gratian&rsquo;s
<em>Decretum</em> and other collections in canon law. These text books
were prescribed by the university, which set standards for the schools
that belonged to it.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 See the Latin text of the Vulgate. The standard English translation
of the Vulgate is Challoner&rsquo;s eighteenth century revision of the
Douai-Rheims version
 (<a href="index-2.html#OIR-bible">Other Internet Resources, Bible</a>
 for both). On the history of this translation see the Wikipedia
article on the Douai bible listed under
 &ldquo;<a href="index-2.html#OIR-wiki">Other Internet Resources</a>&rdquo;.
 My references will be to the Vulgate and translation will be Douai.
(The language of the Douai translation is old fashioned, but it is the
English translation closest to the medieval understanding of the
Vulgate text.) The divisions and names of the parts of the medieval
bible were not altogether the same as those of the King James version.
The medieval &ldquo;canon&rdquo; of scripture, i.e., the list of books
recognised as belonging to the bible differed somewhat from the canon
recognised by Protestants, notably by its inclusion of Machabees. In
this entry, we refer to 1 and 2 Samuel, which precede 1 and 2 Kings,
rather than 1 to 4 Kings.</p>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 The theory of &ldquo;passive obedience&rdquo; is the theory that if a
ruler gives a command contrary to God&rsquo;s commands, one may obey
it passively rather than actively, i.e., not actively carry out the
command, but not resist the punishment the ruler then inflicts. An
outgrowth of the teachings of Martin Luther, Huldriech Zwingli
(1484&ndash;1531) and John Calvin (1509&ndash;64), such a doctrine was
common in the seventeenth century among Protestants and was also held
by some Catholics, e.g., Bossuet. See now Oakley 2015: 107&ndash;27; also
the essays of Oakley and Somerville in Burns and Goldie 1991.</p>

 Although better editions of individual authors and texts often exist
and continue to appear, no other series is as comprehensive as J.P.
Migne&rsquo;s <em>Patrologiae cursus completus</em> (221 volumes for
the
 <a href="http://patristica.net/latina/" target="otherA"><em>Series latina</em></a>,
 and 161 volumes for the

 The age of innocence ended before Adam and Eve had children, whereas
the Golden Age lasted through a number of generations. In medieval
writers the two ideas were sometimes combined: after the Fall, human
beings lived for a while in a social but unpolitical state (though it
was hardly a Golden Age) but gradually developed institutions
appropriate to the fallen state.</p>

 Augustine [413&ndash;26] 1955: v, n.2. A few commentaries were made (see
Smalley 1960: 58, 61f., 88&ndash;101, 121&ndash;32), but not many,
since <em>The City of God</em> was never a set text. 
For links to translations of Augustine's writings, see the
Other Internet Resources in the 
 entry on  <a href="../augustine/index.html">Augustine</a>;
 as always with scans of older documents, one must
 be on the lookout for the occasional scanning error. </p>
</div>

 To sample <em>The City of God</em>, read

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 The reader should be warned that the reference to the different
levels of virtue, peace, etc., does not necessarily represent the
<em>communis opinio</em>. Usually when Augustine says that something
is not &ldquo;true&rdquo; something, he is taken to mean that it is
not that at all. However, such a position implies that
Augustine&rsquo;s thinking was full of inconsistencies. For example,
Carlyle and Carlyle (1903: vol. 1, 166&ndash;7) says that
Augustine&rsquo;s definition of commonwealth makes justice irrelevant
to the existence of a commonwealth, and remarks (169) that among the
Fathers this view was unique to Augustine. Yet (as Carlyle and Carlyle
1903, vol. 1, 167, acknowledge) Augustine says that apart from justice a
kingdom is only robbery on a large scale. On this interpretation,
justice is not irrelevant: anything that can be called a commonwealth
must exhibit justice in some degree. See
 <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/120102.htm" target="otherA"><em>City of God</em> II.21</a>.</p>

 Arquilli&egrave;re 1955. The conception has been severely criticised:
see de Lubac 1984: 255&ndash;308. More recently, Saak 2006:
262&ndash;3, has suggested the term might best be applied to the
political thought of members of the Order of Hermits of St Augustine
(e.g., see the entry on
 <a href="../giles/index.html">Giles of Rome</a>).</p>

 On warfare see
 <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/140622.htm" target="otherA"><em>Contra Faustum</em> XXII.74&ndash;80</a>, letters to Boniface
 (417: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102189.htm" target="otherA">Letter 189.4</a>), Marcellinus
 (c. 411/2: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102138.htm" target="otherA">Letter 138.2</a>); these letters and other texts are translated by Atkins and Dodaro (<em>Augustine: Political Writings</em>: 30&ndash;31, 214&ndash;26). Causa
23 of Gratian&rsquo;s <em>Decretum</em> (Friedberg 1879: vol. 1, col.
889ff.) includes many excerpts from Augustine, and is the source of
much medieval thinking about warfare. Russell 1975: 16ff. is the
classic exposition; see also his updated overview in Russell 2010. Greenwood 2014 discusses how Augustine fits into the interrelationship of Roman and canon law on
the topic of war.</p>

 Bayle [1686] 2005, part III, quotes Augustine&rsquo;s justification
for coercing heretics and subjects his reasoning to devastating
criticism. On the coercion of heretics, see also the letters to
Boniface
 (c. 417: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102185.htm" target="otherA">Letter 185</a>; also in <em>Augustine: Political Writings</em>: 173&ndash;203)
 and (<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102093.htm" target="otherA">Letter 93</a>), and Donatus
 (c. 411/4: <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102173.htm" target="otherA">Letter 173</a>; also in <em>Augustine: Political Writings</em>: 152&ndash;8). See

 Nelson 1988: 228&ndash;9; also Nelson 1986: 59&ndash;60,
107&ndash;111. On the later development of ideas of consent see
Tierney 1982: 39&ndash;42. In successive volumes, Oakley 2012: 138ff.
and 2015: 172ff., has followed the growing strands of consent-based
political thought through to the end of the middle ages.</p>

 Translations of Justinian's corpus are listed in the bibliography below. Note that the recent (2016) translation of the <em>Codex</em> is based on the
 annotated translation made by Fred Blume (and now available on
the University of Wyoming&rsquo;s College of Law George William Hopper
Law Library
 <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/lawlib/blume-justinian/" target="otherA">website</a>).
 Blume&rsquo;s annotated translations of the <em>Novels</em> may also
be found
 <a href="http://www.uwyo.edu/lawlib/justinian-novels" target="otherA">there</a>.
 Generally, these translations should be used in favour of S.P.
Scott&rsquo;s
 <a href="https://droitromain.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/Anglica/codjust_Scott.htm" target="otherA">translation</a>;
 however, it should be noted that Scott relied on a version of the
<em>Corpus iuris civilis</em> that is closer in organization to the
medieval &ldquo;vulgate&rdquo; version. One important consequence of
this is that Scott&rsquo;s translation of the <em>Code</em> includes
the <em>authenticae</em> (i.e., excerpts from related but subsequent
<em>novellae constitutiones</em>, or <em>Novels</em>, which copyists
inserted between constitutions of the <em>Code</em> so as to provide
the law &ldquo;as amended&rdquo;). For some discussion of the importance of the <em>authenticae</em>, see  Pennington 2011.</p>

 The study of Gratian and the <em>Decretum</em> have both advanced
much in recent years (see Pennington 2014), and it is widely known how
seminal an influence Gratian had on the political thought of
subsequent lawyers and theologians. However, concentrated studies of
Gratian&rsquo;s political thought are rare; Chodorow 1972 is an attempt, not altogether
successful, to delineate the political thought of the
<em>Decretum</em>. Currently, only parts of the <em>Decretum</em> are
available in English: Gratian [c. 1140] 1993 (distinctions
1&ndash;20) and 2016 (the so-called <em>Treatise on Penance</em>: C.
33 q. 3). A translation of the entire <em>Decretum</em> along with its
<em>Ordinary Gloss</em> is due to appear (hopefully soon) from the
press of the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies.
 See also the items listed under
 &ldquo;<a href="index-2.html#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>&rdquo;,
 which includes some of the pre-Gratian materials.</p>

 Historiography on the &ldquo;origin&rdquo; of subjective natural
rights remains unsettled. Historians are inclined to champion the era
with which they are most familiar. For a classical origin, see Miller
1995; proponents of an
early modern origin are too numerous to list, but Strauss 1953 remains a classic example.
Medievalists, however, are mainly inclined to accept Tierney 1997, who
looks to the canonists of the twelfth century (e.g., Rufinus) as early
proponents of a form of natural rights. Among medieval political
<em>philosophers</em> (as opposed to jurists),
 <a href="../ockham/index.html">William of Ockham</a>
 is the best known, but historians have championed others
as well, including Thomas Aquinas (see the entry on
 <a href="../aquinas-moral-political/index.html">Thomas Aquinas: moral and political philosophy</a>),
 and Marsilius of Padua. Less familiar names who deserve greater attention
include:
 <a href="../henry-ghent/index.html">Henry of Ghent</a>,
 <a href="../olivi/index.html">Peter Olivi</a>,
 <a href="../godfrey/index.html">Godfrey of Fontaines</a>.</p>

 &ldquo;According to natural law all persons were born free&hellip;. slavery
itself was unknown; but after slavery was admitted by the Law of
Nations&hellip;&rdquo; (<em>Digest</em> 1.1.4). According to Isidore, in
Gratian, D. 1, c. 7 (trans. Thompson and Gordley 1993: 6), natural law
includes &ldquo;the one liberty of all&rdquo;.</p>

 According to <em>Institutes</em> 2.1.11&ndash;12, property originates
by natural law, with which the law of nations is synonymous: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Of some things we obtain <em>dominium</em> [lordship] by natural law,
which, as we have said, is called the law of nations&hellip; For
whatever belonged before to no one is granted by natural reason to the
one who takes possession. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But according to other texts, the distinction of lordship was established
by the law of nations in a sense not synonymous with natural law
(e.g., <em>Digest</em> 1.1.5).</p>

 Natural law includes &ldquo;the common possession of all&rdquo; (D.
1, c. 7, Friedberg 1879: vol. 1, col. 2). &ldquo;Superfluous&rdquo;
property must as a matter of justice be made available to the poor,
especially in time of need. See Tierney 1959: 28&ndash;39; Roumy 2006
traces the evolution of the related doctrine that &ldquo;necessity has
no law&rdquo;.</p>

 <em>Digest</em> 1.4.1: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What pleases the ruler has the force of law, since by the <em>lex regia</em>,
which was made concerning the emperor&rsquo;s rule, the people
conferred on him all of its power to rule. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This makes the ruler&rsquo;s will decisive, but note that his
authority rests on a popular decision. (There was some debate among
lawyers as to whether the people could reclaim their authority. See
Gierke 1900: 43&ndash;6, 150&ndash;3; Carlyle and Carlyle 1909: vol. 2, 60&ndash;7; 1928: vol. 5, 49; 
1936: vol. 6, 13&ndash;19.) According to <em>Digest</em> 1.3.31, &ldquo;The
ruler is not bound by the law&rdquo;. (This text is the origin of the
term &ldquo;absolutism&rdquo;.) Another text, often referred to in the
middle ages by the incipit &ldquo;Digna vox&rdquo;, suggested that the
emperor should obey his own laws (<em>Codex</em> 1.14.4): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is a saying worthy of the majesty of a ruler for the ruler to
profess that he is bound by the laws, since our authority depends on
the authority of law. Indeed it is better for the empire for the
rulership to submit to the laws. </p>

 C. 11 q. 1, c. 29 and c. 30 (Friedberg 1879: vol. 1, col. 634). These
texts are inauthentic, being drawn from the Pseudo-Isidorean
collection. This &ldquo;Isidore&rdquo; is not to be confused with
Isidore of Seville, whom Gratian often quotes. Gratian&rsquo;s
borrowings from Pseudo-Isidore are marked in Friedberg&rsquo;s edition
by references to Hinschius&rsquo;s edition of Pseudo-Isidore (e.g.,
see Friedberg 1879: vol. 1, col. 342, note 221). The Pseudo-Isidorian
collection, made in the mid-ninth century, contained much authentic
material but with an admixture of forgery. Its purpose, apparently,
was to strengthen the position of the French bishops, in part by
enhancing the power of the pope (far off in Rome!)&mdash;by reserving
certain powers to the pope, Isidore sought to protect the bishops
against persons closer at hand. Some of the falsifications included in
the Pseudo-Isidorian collection had been produced earlier, e.g., the
&ldquo;Donation of Constantine&rdquo; (see

 A &ldquo;political animal&rdquo; means an animal whose nature is to
live in a polis or city, not isolated or in small groups. Civilisation
is the natural state not in the sense that it is the original state,
but in the sense that the natural goal of human development is life in
cities: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If the earlier forms of society are natural, so is the state, for it
is the end of them, and the nature of a thing is its end. For what
each thing is when fully developed, we call its nature&hellip; Hence
it is evident that the state is a creation of nature, and that man is
by nature a political animal.
 (<a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.1.one.html" target="other"><em>Politics</em> I.2,
 1252 b30&ndash;1253 a3</a>) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this translation (by Jowett) &ldquo;state&rdquo; corresponds to the
Greek <em>polis</em>, which in the Latin translation is
<em>civitas</em>, in English &ldquo;city&rdquo;. On the vocabulary see
Luscombe 1992. Recently, Toste 2014 has shown how medieval
philosophers, when commenting on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em> and <em>Politics</em>, questioned the ways in which this
impulse should be considered natural.</p>

 <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.1.one.html" target="other"><em>Politics</em> I.5 and 6</a> could be taken as a dialectical exploration of
the question of the justice of slavery, but from other places in the
<em>Politics</em> it is clear that Aristotle himself believed that
some human beings were marked by nature to be slaves: &ldquo;Slaves
and brute animals&hellip; cannot [form a state], for they have no
share in happiness or in a life of free choice&rdquo;
 (<a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/politics.3.three.html" target="other">III.9,
 1280 a32&ndash;4</a>). According to Duns Scotus (d. 1308) slavery in the
sense of harsh subjection to another can be justified only as
punishment. &ldquo;Natural&rdquo; slavery, which Scotus describes as
&ldquo;civil and political subjection&rdquo;, ought to benefit the
slave; such slaves do have free will and a possibility of virtue. See

 The contribution of the jurists of the <em>ius commune</em> to

Hooker maintains that when the people are Christians there is no

the secular ruler is then (in some sense) the head of the Church, with
sole authority to call church assemblies, with a veto over their
legislation, with authority to appoint bishops and other officials,

English, a parenthetical reference will follow the citation.) The
<em>Work of Ninety Days</em>, the <em>Dialogus</em> and others of
Ockham&rsquo;s political writings are &ldquo;recitative&rdquo;, i.e.,
report opinions without explicitly indicating what the author holds;
other works, including the <em>Breviloquium</em>, are
&ldquo;assertive&rdquo; writings, in which Ockham states plainly what
he holds. Guided by the assertive writings and by other clues it is
usually possible to decide which opinions in the recitative writings
are the author&rsquo;s. See Knysh 1997. For the relationship between
Ockham&rsquo;s <em>Work of Ninety Days</em> and contemporary
Franciscan writings about property, see Robinson 2011, 2012, 2014b;
see also Miethke 2010, 2012.</p>

 According to <em>Opus nonaginta dierum</em> 92.16&ndash;45 (<em>Work of Ninety Days</em>: 573&ndash;4), the right to establish
property seems to be from natural law of the third kind, supposing the
circumstances of the fallen state. In <em>Breviloquium</em> 3.7.35ff.
(<em>Short Discourse</em>: 89&ndash;90)
it is said to have been given by God by a positive grant.</p>

 Property implies exclusion of use by others, <em>Opus nonaginta dierum</em> 26.38&ndash;41 (<em>Work of Ninety Days</em>: 308).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-67">67.</a>
 For all this argument see especially <em>Opus nonaginta dierum</em>, chapters 64 and 65, 87&ndash;90.
The natural right of using should not be confused with the &ldquo;use
of right&rdquo; and &ldquo;right of using&rdquo; that are legal
rights. See <em>Opus nonaginta dierum</em> 2.127ff, 2.155ff, and 6.268&ndash;70, (<em>Work of Ninety Days</em>:
60&ndash;3, 145).
For contrasting views on the success of Ockham&rsquo;s argument, see
Brett 1997: 50ff. and Kilcullen 2001c: 45f. For Ockham&rsquo;s theory
of property see also <em>Breviloquium</em> 3.7 (<em>Short Discourse</em>:
57&ndash;90).</p>

 All the translations of Ockham's works listed below other than the <em>Work of Ninety Days</em> address this issue. The <em>Dialogus</em>
is in the process of being edited. So far, one volume has appeared (volume 8 of his <em>Opera politica</em>; the German edition and translation by Miethke includes copious invaluable notes). As work on the critical edition (and
English translation) progresses, the results are posted
 <a href="http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/dialogus/ockdial.html" target="otherA">online</a>
 under the auspices of the British Academy. A (draft) translation of his
<em>Octo quaestiones de potestate papae</em> (<em>Eight Questions on the Power of the Pope</em>; excluding questions 3
and 8 as of January 2017) is also available
 <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/jwrobinson/#Translations" target="other">online</a>,
 though question 3 may be found in Ockham, <em>Letter</em>: 303&ndash;33.</p>

 For Ockham&rsquo;s disagreements with Marsilius, see
the editors' Endnote 4 (<em>Opera politica</em>, vol. 8: 360ff; or
 <a href="http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/dialogus/31dEndnotes.pdf" target="otherA">online</a>);
 see also Miethke's introduction to 3.1 <em>Dialogus</em> in <em>Die Amtsvollmacht von Papst und Klerus</em>: 38ff. The best, but not sole, evidence that Ockham knew
the writings of Marsilius directly is in
 <a href="http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/dialogus/t31d3.html" target="otherA">3.1 <em>Dialogus</em>, books 3</a>

 On the &ldquo;regularly/occasionally&rdquo; contrast, see Bayley 1949
and Robinson 2014a: 187ff. For Ockham&rsquo;s attempts to specify
papal power and its limits see <em>Breviloquium</em> 2.16&ndash;18
(<em>Short Discourse</em>: 51&ndash;8);
 <a href="http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/dialogus/t31d1new.html#zp16" target="otherA">3.1 <em>Dialogus</em> 1.16</a>&ndash;17

 A pope who falls into heresy loses office <em>ipso facto</em>, but
still has to be removed from factual exercise of papal power; a pope
who is not a heretic but is accused of serious sin (e.g., unjust
interference with the rights of lay people) needs to be tried and
then, if guilty, deposed. An early position of Ockham&rsquo;s
(Robinson 2012: 297f.), he continued to develop it. See, e.g.,
<em>Octo questiones</em> 3.12.120ff., (<em>Letter</em>: 327ff.). For
Ockham&rsquo;s view on how it can be done, see McGrade 1974: chapter
2, and Ockham&rsquo;s <em>Contra Benedictum</em> 7 (<em>Opera politica</em>:
vol. 3: 303ff.).</p>

 See <em>Contra Benedictum</em> 6.6 (<em>Opera politica</em>, vol. 3: 286): the phrase &ldquo;legibus
solutus&rdquo; refers to civil law only (<em>ius civile</em>). For an overview of the ways the jurists understood this phrase with ample bibliography, see Black 2009: ch. 1.</p>

 Tierney 1969; see more generally Tierney 1955 and Oakley 2003. Fasolt
1991: 318&ndash;9 has warned against speaking of &ldquo;conciliar
theory&rdquo; per se.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-75">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-75">75.</a>
 Ockham&rsquo;s opinion was that no part of the Church, neither pope
nor council, was infallible (see Tierney 1972: chapter 6; and Kilcullen
1991). For what may be an attempt to answer Ockham, see Marsilius
<em>Defensor minor</em> 12.5 (trans. Nederman: 42).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-76">76.</a>
 See Burns and Izbicki 1997 for an English translation of the debate
over conciliarism between Cajetan, Almain and Maior. Like Ockham,
Cajetan held that the constitution of the Church is monarchical, by
divine law, but, unlike Ockham, did not envisage the possibility that
on occasion exceptions might be made to divine law.</p>

 The question of whether there was a sharp &ldquo;break&rdquo; with
medieval political thought remains contentious. Medievalists often
stress continuity (e.g., Oakley, Pennington, Tierney; see also Skinner), while
scholars whose focus lies after the middle ages tend to stress rupture
or break (Pocock 1975 is an influential example). In the context of
the historiography of medieval political thought, see the exchange between
Cary Nederman (1990 and 1996) and Francis Oakley (1995 and, less
directly, 1996). See also Nederman 2009: chapters 1&ndash;4.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-79">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-79">79.</a>
 Some of these trends are more apparent in the writings of the
medieval jurists and the so-called humanists who lived and worked in
the city-states of Italy.</p>

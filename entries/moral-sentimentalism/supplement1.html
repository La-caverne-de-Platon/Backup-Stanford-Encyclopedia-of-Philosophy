<h2><a name="1">Anti-Rationalist Arguments</a></h2>

<p>
Modern sentimentalism first arose at the turn of the 18<sup>th</sup>
century in opposition to rationalist and intuitionist views developed
by Thomas Hobbes and Bernard de Mandeville, and Cambridge Platonists
such as Ralph Cudworth and Samuel Clarke, respectively. From the first
criticisms onwards, sentimentalists emphasized the limits of reason
and understanding when it comes to explaining or justifying moral
judgments, determining moral truth, and motivating moral action.
Contemporary sentimentalists make similar arguments.</p>

<h3>Hutcheson</h3>

<p>
The first sentimentalist to make a sustained case against rationalism
and intuitionism was Frances Hutcheson. His first target were views
that held that what makes some actions right is that they are
commanded by some superior who has a power to sanction us so as to
make it advantageous for us to obey the laws, and that we
<em>approve</em> of actions because they are in our self-interest,
either by their very nature or because of the laws of the superior
(1725: 86&ndash; 87). On this kind of view, practical reason can tell
us what&rsquo;s right or wrong, since it can figure out what&rsquo;s
in our self-interest, which Hutcheson understood in hedonic terms.
Hutcheson pointed out four problems with such views. We don&rsquo;t
morally approve of inanimate objects that are sources of pleasure; we
don&rsquo;t equally morally approve of two people who provide us with
what&rsquo;s in our self-interest, if one of them does so out of
selfish motives and the other out of sheer benevolence; we don&rsquo;t
morally approve of traitors, whose actions may be very beneficial to
us; and finally, we <em>do</em> morally approve of distant or
historical benevolent characters, whose actions could in no way serve
our self-interest (1725: 89&ndash;94). He also observes that the
strength of moral approval tracks the benevolent motives of an action,
not the good to us (or anyone) that they actually produce &ndash;
someone with little ability to do good can be highly praiseworthy.</p>

<p>
There is a different, theoretical rather than prudential conception of
reason, according to which it is &ldquo;our power of finding out true
propositions&rdquo; (1728: 137). It is the target especially in
<em>Illustrations Upon the Moral Sense</em>. Hutcheson distinguishes
between &ldquo;exciting reasons&rdquo;, qualities that move us to act,
and &ldquo;justifying reasons&rdquo;, which are considerations that
explain why we approve of something (1728: 138). It is important to
bear in mind that this distinction does <em>not</em> correspond to the
contemporary distinction between motivating reasons
(often&nbsp;conceived of as mental states moving us to act) and
justifying or normative reasons, considerations that favour acting in
some way. When Hutcheson asks about justifying reasons, he asks about
what, as a matter of fact, makes us think some action is right or
good.</p>

<p>
Reason cannot be the source of <em>exciting reasons</em>, since it can
only tell us&nbsp;which actions lead to which end. Only subordinate
ends can be called reasonable or unreasonable on the basis of whether
they are conducive to an ultimate end, but the ultimate ends
themselves are beyond reason. Indeed, Hutcheson anticipates rational
choice theory, and says that an agent acts &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo;
when she chooses the action that is most likely to produce the best
balance of preference-satisfaction (1728: 143). It is the passions,
whether selfish or benevolent, that set these ends. Some may think
that the recognition that one action would produce more good than the
alternative will by itself provide motivation for a rational agent to
choose it, but Hutcheson rejects this. Benevolent desires are needed,
as</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[w]ithout such Affections this Truth, &ldquo;that an hundred
Felicities is a greater Sum than one Felicity,&rdquo; will no more
excite to study the Happiness of the Hundred, than this Truth,
&ldquo;an hundred Stones are greater than one,&rdquo; will excite a
Man, who has no desire of Heaps, to cast them together. (1728:
142)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nor will reason by itself explain moral approval. It can tell us that
a certain action is fit to achieve an end, but the very worst actions
can be reasonable in this sense. Final ends do not either conform or
fail to conform to any truths discoverable by reason. Consequently,
the source of <em>justifying reasons</em> must lie elsewhere. For
Hutcheson, it is moral sense that leads us to approve of benevolent
actions
 (<a href="index-2.html#MorSenThe">see Section 2.1 of the main entry</a>).</p>
 
<h3>Hume</h3>

<p>
Hume&rsquo;s more familiar arguments about the limits of reason are
clearly inspired by Hutcheson. They can usefully be divided into
<em>motivation sceptical</em> and <em>content sceptical</em> arguments
(Korsgaard 1986).</p>

<h4>Motivational scepticism</h4>

<p>
According to the <em>Anti-Rationalist</em> <em>Practicality
Argument</em>, our moral evaluations influence our actions and
reactions to the actions of others, while reason lacks such power.
Hume offers several variants of this argument. Here is one:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Since morals &hellip; have an influence on the actions and affections,
it follows, that they cannot be derived from reason; and that because
reason alone &hellip; can never have any such influence. (T 457)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here is one natural reading of this influential argument in
contemporary terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The Anti-Rationalist Practicality Argument</p>

<ol>

<li>Moral judgments are intrinsically motivating. (Moral Judgment
Internalism)</li>

<li>Reason(ing) alone does not motivate. (Inertia of Reason
Thesis)</li>

<li>So, moral judgments cannot be conclusions of reason.
(Anti-Rationalism)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>
The first premise says that moral judgments themselves move us to act.
It is now standardly taken as an a priori claim, but for the
arch-empiricist Hume, it is probably just an a posteriori observation.
He says that &ldquo;common experience&rdquo; informs us that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
men are often governed by their duties, and are deterred from some
actions by the opinion of injustice, and impelled to others by that of
obligation. (T 457)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Note that Hume&rsquo;s characterization of &lsquo;morals&rsquo;
sometimes suggests it is moral <em>facts</em> that motivate, and
sometimes that it is moral <em>opinions</em> that do.)</p>

<p>
For the crucial Inertia of Reason premise, Hume offers two supporting
arguments. Reason, for Hume, is the faculty of <em>reasoning</em> or
inferring. The <em>Anti-Representationalist Argument</em> says that
passions don&rsquo;t represent how things are, so they can&rsquo;t be
true or stand in logical relations, which means reasoning gets no grip
on them (T 458) (see also
 <a href="index-2.html#PerMod">Section 5.1</a>
 of the main entry). The <em>Elimination Argument</em> says that
reasoning consists in demonstrating necessary relations between ideas,
as in logic or mathematics, or in inferring probable causal relations
on the basis of experience. But neither discovering relations between
ideas nor discovering that an action would probably produce a certain
outcome will <em>by itself</em> move us to act, unless we want the end
to be produced. Nor will instrumental reasoning necessarily move us.
If we do wish to bring something about, we will <em>probably</em>
acquire a desire to take what causal reasoning reveals as a necessary
means, but if we don&rsquo;t, that is not a failure of reason.</p>

<p>
Many commentators consequently argue that Hume doesn&rsquo;t really
have a conception of <em>practical</em> reasoning at all. The
Elimination Argument has also been accused of being straightforwardly
question-begging: after all, Kantian rationalists say that there is a
third type of reasoning, namely (non-instrumental) practical
reasoning, that <em>does</em> motivate. However, the burden is on the
rationalist to come up with an account that displays why their
favoured kind of motivating process deserves to be called
<em>reasoning</em>, and not something else, and that it delivers
determinate conclusions about ends (see below).</p>

<p>
How should the <em>conclusion</em> of the Practicality Argument be
understood? Some have taken it to establish that moral
<em>judgments</em> are not <em>beliefs</em>. But Hume always talks
about the inertia of reason, not of belief. As long as there are
beliefs that result from something other than reasoning, they might be
motivating, and he explicitly says that hedonic beliefs are (T
119&ndash;120). But this relation between beliefs and motivation is
causal, not rational, so reasoning alone does not motivate. However,
this still leaves the conclusion puzzling. Hume has argued that moral
judgment (a psychological state) motivates, while reasoning (a
psychological process) doesn&rsquo;t. It doesn&rsquo;t follow that
reasoning alone couldn&rsquo;t produce a moral judgment, which then
(non-rationally) motivates. Hume needs a further, undefended
assumption to the effect that non-motivating processes cannot produce
motivating states. Perhaps, as Rachel Cohon (2008) has recently
argued, he only aims to establish that moral discrimination and
reasoning are distinct processes, the former being sentiment-driven
and inherently motivating.</p>

<h4>Content scepticism</h4>

<p>
Even if reason could move us to act, it doesn&rsquo;t follow that it
can, as such, either tell us or determine what the right thing to do
is. That is a further question. Content sceptics about practical
reason believe that reason by itself cannot offer guidance to action,
or inform us of what intuitionists call the fitness of an attitude or
response. Hume&rsquo;s argument for content scepticism proceeds by
elimination:</p>

<ol>

<li>&ldquo;As the operations of human understanding divide themselves
into two kinds, the comparing of ideas, and the inferring of matter of
fact; were virtue discovered by the understanding; it must be an
object of one of these operations, nor is there any third operation of
the understanding, which can discover it.&rdquo; (T 463)</li>

<li>&ldquo;[So,] [i]f the thought and understanding were alone capable
of fixing the boundaries of right and wrong, the character of virtuous
and vicious either must lie in some relations of objects, or must be a
matter of fact, which is discovered by our reasoning.&rdquo; (T 463)
(from 1)</li>

<li>Virtue does not consist in an a priori discoverable relation
between ideas.</li>

<li>Virtue does not consist in a matter of fact that can be
inferred.</li>

<li>So, we cannot discover what is right or wrong by reasoning. (from
2, 3, 4)</li>
</ol>

<p>
The most natural reading of the conclusion of Hume&rsquo;s content
sceptical argument is an epistemological one: we cannot discover what
is right and wrong by reason. Premises 3 and 4 are conclusions of
supplemental metaphysical arguments aiming to show that facts about
right and wrong don&rsquo;t consist in facts that could be discovered
by reason, as Hume understands it. In support of Premise 3, he
presents a number of cases in which animals, plants, or inanimate
objects stand in the same relation to each other as virtuous or
vicious people and those affected by their action do, while
nevertheless lacking both virtue and vice. This, Hume believes, shows
that it&rsquo;s not <em>merely</em> the fact that people stand in a
certain relation to each other that makes an action right or
wrong.</p>

<p>
It is in the course of Premise 4 that Hume makes some of his
best-known claims about reason. He grants that reasoning, presumably
together with perception, can discover matters of fact about actions
or people&rsquo;s characters. But virtue and vice are not among these
facts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Take any action allowed to be vicious: Wilful murder, for instance.
Examine it in all lights, and see if you can find that matter of fact,
or real existence, which you call vice. In which-ever way you take it,
you find only certain passions, motives, volitions and thoughts. There
is no other matter of fact in the case. The vice entirely escapes you,
as long as you consider the object. (T 468)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is not that Hume denies that motives and thoughts of the agent and
the pain and suffering of the victim <em>make</em> an action wrong or
agent vicious. But these facts are not <em>identical</em> with
wrongness or viciousness. The latter, if it is a fact, is a different
kind of fact. It is, at least originally, sentiment that discerns it
&ndash; although Hume&rsquo;s arguments leave it open that discovering
by reason the tendency of something to give rise to sentiment could be
a source of moral knowledge (Sturgeon 2001).</p>

<p>
Hume makes his famous complaint about writers who move from is-claims
to ought-claims in the context of discussing Premise 4. The problem,
he claims, is that &ldquo;this ought, or ought not, expresses some new
relation or affirmation&rdquo;, which is &ldquo;entirely
different&rdquo; from other relations and therefore not inferable from
them (T 469). Unfortunately, Hume does not clarify what makes the
ought-relation different. The best interpretations are probably that
it is normative in a different way, or that it, when appreciated,
motivates anyone to avoid the vicious action, unlike the wrong-making
facts themselves.</p>

<p>
How might rationalists respond? Much as in the case of the
Practicality Argument, it is open to the rationalist to deny Premise
1, and make the case that there are operations of reason that are not
reducible to deduction or induction. Perhaps these other ways of
reasoning can discover the new kind of relation or affirmation that
vice or virtue consists in. Perhaps rightness or wrongness even
consists in being unconditionally reason-giving for any rational
being, as Kantians would say. Classical sentimentalists, writing
before Kant, did not address this type of argument.</p>

<h3>Contemporary Anti-Rationalism</h3>

<p>
As noted above, it is a common complaint against Hume that he works
with an unduly narrow conception of practical reason. Those who take
this line agree that <em>theoretical</em> or <em>instrumental</em>
reason is incapable of telling us or determining the moral truth, or
motivating us. But there is more to reason than that. In particular,
Kantians believe that pure practical reason can rule out immoral
maxims (subjective principles for acting), and can determine the will
accordingly. Only then our will is autonomous (self-legislating),
since otherwise it must be determined by something outside it, an
inclination that we simply find ourselves with.</p>

<p>
Contemporary anti-rationalist arguments thus take the form of showing
that practical reason as conceived of by Kant and Kantians will not
yield the right answers, nor suffice for motivation. The Kantian
picture is roughly as follows. Intentional actions proceed from maxims
that specify an act and the end or purpose for which it is done. A
maxim might be &ldquo;I will open the door in order to let the air
in&rdquo;. Some maxims are such that not everyone could consistently
adopt them. Kantians distinguish two kinds of tests for practical
consistency: the contradiction in conception test and the
contradiction in the will test.</p>

<p>
The Kantian claim, then, is that an action is morally wrong if and
only if its maxim cannot be universalized without practical
contradiction. This biconditional is an open invitation to provide
counterexamples: actions that are <em>not</em> wrong even though their
maxims aren&rsquo;t universalizable, and actions that <em>are</em>
wrong, though their maxims are universalizable. If either sort can be
found, pure practical reason isn&rsquo;t a reliable guide in moral
thought, and <em>content scepticism</em> is reaffirmed in the face of
the Kantian conception of reason. For the first kind of
counterexample, suppose (contrary to fact, as it turns out) that
credit card companies only make a profit from interest and late fees.
Simon Blackburn (1998) considers the following maxim: I will pay my
credit card bills at the end of every month in order to avoid paying
interest and late fees. There seems to be nothing wrong with such a
maxim or resulting action. Yet if everyone acted on it, credit card
companies would go out of business (on our assumption), with the
result that it would be impossible for anyone to pay their credit card
bills.</p>

<p>
For the second kind, Jesse Prinz suggests that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If everyone were to kick children whenever they saw children on the
street, the practice of child-kicking would not be rendered
incoherent. (Prinz 2007: 131)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Prinz doesn&rsquo;t formulate the maxim behind the action, but the
example can be filled in &ndash; the maxim might be &ldquo;I will kick
a child whenever I see one in order to relieve my frustration&rdquo;.
There&rsquo;s no obvious contradiction in willing that everyone kicks
a child in order to relieve their frustration.</p>

<p>
Sentimentalists think it is no accident that reason is impotent in
this respect. Blackburn emphasizes the need to &ldquo;distinguish
defects of input from ones of processing and hence output&rdquo;
(1998: 240). Reason has to do with the former, not the latter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Reason gives us our representation of the salient features of the
situation we are in, and it gives us the ability to make further
deductions and inferences about that situation. Reason&rsquo;s office
is to represent the world to us as it is. But then, how we react to
that situation, and that includes how we react to it ethically, is
another matter. (Blackburn 1998: 240)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On Blackburn&rsquo;s view, while we may call a knave who lies and
deceives when he can get away with it vicious or odious, &ldquo;it
does not add anything except rhetoric also to call him
irrational&rdquo; (Blackburn 1998: 223). A similar point is also made
by Bernard Williams. According to Williams (1979), what people have
(normative) reason to do is determined by what conclusions could be
reached by procedurally sound practical deliberation from their actual
set of motives. There are only such <em>internal</em> practical
reasons, since putative external reasons could not rationally engage
the agent&rsquo;s motivation and therefore contribute to the right
kind of explanation of action. For Williams, it is thus contingent on
what people&rsquo;s actual goals are whether they have reason to
comply with morality&rsquo;s demands. If so, moral rationalism is
false. (See the entry on
 <a href="../reasons-internal-external/index.html">reasons for action: internal vs. external</a>
 for a detailed discussion.)</p>

<p>
Some contemporary sentimentalists also reaffirm <em>motivational
scepticism</em> in the face of Kantian accounts. It is a familiar
complaint that being irrational, especially in the Kantian sense, need
not be something that terribly bothers an agent. As Prinz puts it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he knave might say, &lsquo;I recognize that it is inconsistent to
value myself while treating others poorly, but I simply don&rsquo;t
mind being inconsistent in this respect. After all, by favoring myself
I have so much to gain!&rsquo; (Prinz 2007: 134)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Part of his point is that avowed inconsistency in one respect need not
mean that reason gets no grip at all on a person: immorality
doesn&rsquo;t render one baffling and uninterpretable in the way that
openly contradictory factual beliefs or plans might. In a similar
vein, Max Hayward denies that putative rational requirements of
consistency and even adopting means to our ends derive from reason,
but rather &ldquo;gain whatever authority they have from the role they
play in permitting and facilitating interpersonal relationships&rdquo;
(Hayward 2019: 52) &ndash; according to him, if I flout such norms,
others won&rsquo;t be able to sympathize with me.</p>

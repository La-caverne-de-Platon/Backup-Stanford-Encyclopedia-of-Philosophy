<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Rule-Following and Intentionality</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 We&rsquo;re following Paul Boghossian (1989) in this respect. We
won&rsquo;t address the issue of the extent to which Kripke&rsquo;s
interpretation is faithful to Wittgenstein&rsquo;s text. Note that
Kripke does not actually endorse either the sceptical argument or the
sceptical solution, but rather &ldquo;expounds Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
argument as it struck Kripke, as it presented a problem for him&rdquo;
(1982: 5). For ease of exposition, we largely ignore this in the text.
For recent discussion of what is at stake in Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
rule-following considerations, see, among others, Stroud 2011,
Goldfarb 2012, Ebbs 2016, and Ginsborg 2020. Other works that
foreground the importance of the rule-following investigations in
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s later philosophy include Wright (1980) and
Fogelin (1976 [1987]). A discussion of the rule-following
considerations that locates them in a philosophical tradition going
back to Kant can be found in Haase (2009).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 In his 1989, Boghossian appears to suggest that, for the sceptical
arguments to get going at the level of content, we need to assume that
mental content properties are carried by linguistic-bearers, although
it is left open whether we need to view these bearers as, in Fodorian
Language of Thought fashion, syntactically and semantically
structured; we agree with the more liberal line taken in Boghossian
1990, where Boghossian recognizes that we don&rsquo;t need to exploit
any facts about the putative bearers of content in order to get the
sceptical arguments going.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 We use the singular pronoun when explaining the sceptical challenge,
even though the entry is co-written, as the challenge is supposed to
be faced from the perspective of the individual speaker.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Among the commentators who resist reading the second condition as
requiring that meaning facts are categorically prescriptive are Kusch
2006, Verheggen 2000, 2011, and Bridges 2014. (Note that in his 2021
CUNY seminar on rule-following, attended by the authors, Kripke
himself said that he had only hypothetical prescriptivity in
mind.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 For example, in the &ldquo;two soldiers&rdquo; variant of the
Prisoners&rsquo; Dilemma that Mackie outlines (1977: 115), the
judgement that one ought not to desert one&rsquo;s post in the face of
the enemy&mdash;where the &ldquo;ought&rdquo; in question is
categorical&mdash;although false, is such that its acceptance helps to
make probable the best possible outcome for the group (in a non-moral
sense of &ldquo;best&rdquo;).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Another example of a non-eliminativist error theory is arguably
provided by Hartry Field&rsquo;s nominalism about arithmetic (Field
1980, 1989). In Field&rsquo;s account, the subsidiary norm is cashed
out in terms of the notion of <em>conservativeness.</em> (We take the
term &ldquo;subsidiary norm&rdquo; from Wright 1995. Wright goes on to
argue that non-eliminativist error theories are inherently
unstable.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Kripke himself thinks that the mention of agreement here requires a
departure from fully individualistic conceptions of meaning and
content. See also sections 12 and 13 of Boghossian 1989 (and the
references therein to McGinn 1984 and Goldfarb 1985) for more
discussion.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 For what it&rsquo;s worth, Gibbard&rsquo;s reply strikes us as
unconvincing. In the course of defending and developing his account of
moral judgement, the ethical expressivist can help herself to facts
about what is and what is not pleasurable. But she cannot assume that
such facts are <em>moral</em> facts without compromising her claim to
be providing an alternative account of moral judgement to that given
by the moral realist. Likewise, although the expressivist in the case
of meaning and content may help herself to facts about speakers&rsquo;
dispositions, or facts about biological function and the like, she
cannot assume that such facts are <em>semantic</em> or
<em>intentional</em> facts without compromising her claim to be
providing an alternative account of ascriptions of meaning and content
to that provided by the semantic realist. However, in helping herself
to facts about plans or planning states with determinate satisfaction
conditions, she does precisely that. For further useful discussion of
Gibbard&rsquo;s view, see Wikforss (2018), and Boghossian
(forthcoming).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Some philosophers have viewed the sceptical solution proposed by
Kripke&rsquo;s Wittgenstein as hospitable to a form of
non-reductionism, albeit one that is different from the
non-reductionist position rejected by him in his brief discussion in
Kripke (1982: chapter 2). Over the course of that discussion, Kripke
says of the non-reductionist strategy that if &ldquo;taken in an
appropriate way Wittgenstein may even accept it&rdquo; (1982: 51).
Consequently, some have argued that the sceptical solution illustrates
the appropriate way to take non-reductionism, a way that rejects some
of the sceptic&rsquo;s assumptions. According to Kusch, for example,
Kripke proposes a meaning-sceptical variety of primitivism. The view
is a form of primitivism insofar as it takes our linguistic
inclinations to be primitive (2006: 38, 199), but it is sceptical
insofar as it rejects the conception of meaning targeted by the
sceptical argument, which Kusch calls &ldquo;low brow meaning
determinism&rdquo; (see 2006: 11&ndash;12 for an enumeration of its
basic tenets). In a nutshell, according to meaning-determinism, an
agent means something by an expression in virtue of having a
particular mental state that is immediately known by the agent, is
intrinsic to her, guides and justifies her uses of the expression, and
somehow contains all the possible correct applications of the
expression. Indeed, meaning determinism is closely related to
Wilson&rsquo;s classical realism. In a similar vein, David Davies
argues that we should view the sceptical solution as claiming that
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there <em>are</em> semantic facts, but they cannot play any
significant explanatory role with respect to our dispositions to go on
in similar ways with respect to our expressions. (1998: 133; cf. Byrne
1996) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and Sultanescu and Verheggen argue that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Kripke&rsquo;s non-reductionism [as manifested in the sceptical
solution] is ultimately a capitulation to quietism, (2019: 16) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
for it </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
sheds little light, if any, on the question what makes it possible for
there to be a distinction between correct and incorrect applications
of expressions. (2019: 15)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 If this is scepticism about a disposition, it is not
<em>epistemological</em> scepticism of the sort put to one side in
Kripke&rsquo;s discussion. The claim is not that we don&rsquo;t know
what Jones&rsquo;s extended dispositions in the relevant cases are,
but that there are no such dispositions.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 These considerations effectively rule out a response to the finitude
problem that utilizes the notion of an idealized disposition.
We&rsquo;ve so far tacitly assumed that ascriptions of dispositions
can be analysed in terms of counterfactual or subjunctive
conditionals, as follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(CA)</dt>
<dd> &ldquo;<i>S</i> is disposed to <i>A</i> in <i>C</i>&rdquo; is
true iff if <i>S</i> were in conditions <i>C</i>, she would
<i>A</i>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Say we assume also that the conditional on the right-hand side is true
iff in every nearby possible world in which <i>S</i> is in conditions
<i>C</i>, she <i>A</i>s. We could try to deal with the finitude
problem by including within the ideal conditions <i>C</i> some
stipulation that would ensure that <i>S</i>&rsquo;s cognitive capacity
is sufficiently enhanced to allow her to answer arithmetical queries
that are inaccessible given her actual cognitive equipment. In some
cases, though, this will involve <i>S</i> having a brain the size of
the universe, and since there <em>are</em> no nearby possible worlds
in which <i>S</i> has a brain the size of a universe (for the sorts of
reason outlined above), the conditional</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(a)</dt>
<dd> If <i>S</i> had a brain the size of the universe (etc.), she
would respond with the sum</dd>
</dl>

<p>
will not be true in a way that can underwrite the ascription to
<i>S</i> of the disposition to respond with the sum.</p>

<p>
Some philosophers (e.g., Martin and Heil 1998) have attempted to use
the fact that (CA) is problematic (Martin 1994) in order to ward off
Kripke-style objections like those outlined above. Handfield and Bird
(2008) provide a powerful critique of Martin and Heil&rsquo;s defence
of the dispositional theory of meaning (see Boghossian 2015:
342&ndash;3 for a useful summary).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 In Warren&rsquo;s terminology, Jones has an <i>M</i>-general and
stable disposition to produce the sum in normal situations (see Warren
2020: 271).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 The argument in this paragraph might be criticised for conflating
logical and metaphysical notions of consistency and determination, as
follows. Consider again the claim that possession of <span class="sc">disp</span>
is consistent with multiple hypotheses about
what Jones means. If the notion of consistency at play is logical,
then this is surely correct. But, the thought goes, Warren&rsquo;s
idea must be that <span class="sc">disp</span> <em>constitutes</em> or
<em>determines</em> or <em>grounds</em> the meaning fact; this kind of
metaphysical relationship between <span class="sc">disp</span> and the
meaning fact does not require that the ascription of <span class="sc">disp</span>
be logically inconsistent with alternative
hypotheses about what Jones means.</p>

<p>
However, it seems to us that the criticism misses the dialectical
force of the argument. For the argument isn&rsquo;t simply that, since
possession of <span class="sc">disp</span> is consistent with
Jones&rsquo;s meaning quaddition, it can&rsquo;t be constitutive of
his meaning addition. (If this was the argument, it would indeed be
susceptible to the criticism.) Rather, the argument concerns the way
in which <span class="sc">disp</span> is <em>characterised</em> or
<em>specified</em>. Given that Jones&rsquo;s possession of <span class="sc">disp</span>
is logically consistent with her meaning any
one of an infinite set of functions by &ldquo;+&rdquo;, how do we
characterise the normal situation involved in the specification of
<span class="sc">disp</span> in such a way that, of all the functions
in that infinite range, it is <em>addition</em> that is metaphysically
determined by it? On what grounds does dispositionalist claim that an
adequate characterisation can be given in wholly non-semantic and
non-intentional terms, that is, without presupposing that addition is
what is in fact meant by Jones?</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 We&rsquo;ve oversimplified here, glossing over the fact that Warren&rsquo;s
solution to the finitude problem utilizes the notion of a composite
disposition (itself consisting of what Warren calls
&ldquo;singular&rdquo; dispositions) and that the solution to the
error problem upon which it depends focuses on the singular
dispositions out of which the composite disposition is composed.
Nothing crucial turns on this oversimplification, though. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 Scott Soames also seems to neglect Kripke&rsquo;s discussion of
non-reductionism when he claims that the challenge posed by
Kripke&rsquo;s sceptic is &ldquo;to locate non-content-bearing (i.e.
nonintentional) facts that determine the content-bearing ones&rdquo;
(1997: 216n16).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 More specifically, Wright&rsquo;s project is to show that the
proponent of non-reductionism might be able to avoid the
&ldquo;flagrant &hellip; philosophical stone-kicking&rdquo; that he
claims to find in other non-reductionist views, such as Colin
McGinn&rsquo;s (Wright 1989 [2002: 113]). Wright argues that we can
account for the intuitive first-person epistemology and
&ldquo;disposition-like theoreticity&rdquo; (Wright 2001: 87) of
intentional and semantic properties by relying on a judgment-dependent
account of the sort outlined. Such an account takes for granted the
contents of the judgements on which meaning facts allegedly depend,
which is what makes it a variety of non-reductionism. (See Wright
[1992: 138]. Boghossian [1989 [2002: 184&ndash;85]] argues that
judgement-dependent accounts of content are problematic in a way that
does not apply to judgement-dependent accounts of traditional
secondary qualities.) </p>

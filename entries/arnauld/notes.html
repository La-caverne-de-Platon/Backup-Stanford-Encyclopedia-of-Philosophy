 Phillipe Sellier has said that this translation is &ldquo;a literary
and religious monument not unworthy of comparison with Luther&rsquo;s
Bible in Germany and the King James version in England&rdquo; (<em>La
Bible</em>, ed. Philippe Sellier, p. xi).</p>

 He adds an important qualification: &ldquo;I say,
<em>principally</em>, because nothing prevents one from using
authorities in philosophical questions as well, if they are used for
illustration rather than to decide the questions&rdquo; (<em>OA</em>,
40:153).</p>

 Arnauld&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;to represent&rdquo; as a three-place
relational verb (&ldquo;<em>X</em> represents <em>Y</em> to
<em>Z</em>&rdquo;) meaning &ldquo;to make known to&rdquo; is
consistent with Descartes&rsquo; usage. It is often overlooked that
Descartes used the two Latin verbs,
&ldquo;<em>r&eacute;presentare</em> (to represent)&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<em>exhibere</em> (to exhibit or to show)&rdquo;
interchangeably. A good example is the thirteenth paragraph of the
Third Meditation. Here is a literal translation of the Latin:
&ldquo;To be sure, in so far as those ideas are only certain modes of
thinking, I do not recognize any inequality among them and they all
seem to proceed from me in the same way; but, in so far as one
<em>represents (representat)</em> one thing, and another another, it
seems that they are quite different from one another. For without
doubt those that <em>exhibit (exhibent)</em> substance to me are
something greater, and, so to speak, contain in themselves more
objective reality, than those which <em>represent
(r&eacute;presentant)</em> only modes, or accidents, and on the other
hand that [idea] through which I understand a supreme God, eternal,
infinite, omniscient, omnipotent, and creator of all things outside of
himself, has more objective reality in itself, than those through
which finite substances are <em>exhibited</em>
(<em>exhibenter</em>).&rdquo; The two occurrences of
&ldquo;<em>exhibere</em>&rdquo;, as well as the two occurrences of
&ldquo;<em>r&eacute;presentare</em>&rdquo; are translated by the
French &ldquo;<em>representer</em>&rdquo; in the 1647 translation of
the <em>Meditations</em> by the Duc de Luynes, and by the English
&ldquo;represent&rdquo; in the English translation by Cottingham, et
al.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Forming this general rule from the certainty that one is thinking and
alive is an example of the method of analysis, in which one arises to
&ldquo;general notions&rdquo; from &ldquo;the particular examination
of the thing we are investigating&rdquo; (<em>Logic</em>, p. 237).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Regarding the proposition, &ldquo;Everything contained in the clear
and distinct idea of a thing can be truthfully affirmed of that
thing,&rdquo; the Port Royal <em>Logic</em> says, &ldquo;This
principle cannot be contested without destroying everything evident in
human knowledge and establishing a ridiculous Pyrrhonism&rdquo; (p.
247). But if this principle cannot or ought not be doubted, then the
most famous problem Arnauld raised in the &ldquo;Fourth
Objections,&rdquo; namely, &ldquo;how the author avoids reasoning in a
circle when he says that we are sure that what we clearly and
distinctly perceive is true only because God exists&rdquo; (Descartes,
II, 150), does not arise within Arnauld&rsquo;s philosophy, and it is
not clear whether he thought Descartes&rsquo; attempted solution to the
problem was successful.</p>

 In his first letter to Descartes in 1648, Arnauld says, &ldquo;What
you have taught about the distinction of the mind from the body seems
to me quite clear, perspicuous and divine&rdquo; (OA, 38:68). It is
well known that, in the &ldquo;Fourth Objections&rdquo; Arnauld had
raised objections to Descartes&rsquo; argument for the real distinction,
but evidently he was satisfied with Descartes&rsquo; reply.</p>

 <em>Examen d&rsquo;un Ecrit qui a pour titre: Trait&eacute; de
l&rsquo;essence du corps, et ce l&rsquo;union de l&rsquo;ame avec le corps
contra la philosophie de M. Descartes</em>, (<em>OA</em>
38:89&ndash;176). There is no known extant copy of Le Moine&rsquo;s
treatise, but it is quoted fairly extensively by Arnauld. Hereinafter
I will refer to this work by Arnauld simply as
&ldquo;<em>Examen.&rdquo;</em> An improved edition of the work has
been published: <em>Texte revu par Emmanuel Faye</em>, Librarie
Arth&egrave;me Fayard, 1999.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 In Part Two of <em>Examen</em> (<em>OA</em>, 38:100 ff.) Arnauld
takes up the delicate question of whether Descartes&rsquo; position on
the essence of matter is consistent with the Catholic doctrine of
transubstantiation. He begins by saying, &ldquo;In order that the
state of the question be better understood, I thought that I ought to
report a place in the <em>Recherche de la v&eacute;rit&eacute;</em>,
Book 3, Part 2, Ch. 8, N. 2, because it will show both what led to the
definition of matter as extension and our disposition regarding the
mysteries that it seems cannot be reconciled with that
definition.&rdquo; He then quotes five pages from the
<em>Recherche</em> which give an account of the essence of matter
which Arnauld knew perfectly well was not the same as the account
given by Descartes.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 The state of the question is nicely summarized by Denis Moreau in
&ldquo;La &lsquo;Philosophie d&rsquo;Antoine Arnauld&rsquo;: Un
Bilan,&rdquo; in <em>Chroniques de Port-Royal</em>,2011. See also
Emmanuel Faye&rsquo;s article in <em>Oxford Studies in Early Modern
Philosophy</em>.</p>

<div id="note-12">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Nadler classifies &ldquo;the three ways in which God was
conceptualized by leading philosophers in early modern Europe&rdquo;
under the headings &ldquo;The Rationalist God,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Voluntarist God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The God of Spinoza.&rdquo; In the
first he includes Malebranche and Leibniz, in the second Descartes and
Arnauld, and in the third only Spinoza (Nadler 2011).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 He immediately qualifies his support for Moreau&rsquo;s view:
&ldquo;I do not think [Moreau] pushes the identity thesis hard
enough&thinsp;&hellip; . God&rsquo;s will understands because
God&rsquo;s will is only conceptually distinct from God&rsquo;s
understanding.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

 The use of delimiters may help to clarify Aquinas&rsquo; condensed
formula: God wills (that <em>x</em> exist for the sake of <em>y</em>),
but He does not (will that <em>x</em> exist) for the sake of
<em>y</em>.</p>

 On relations between Arnauld and Malebranche prior to the publication
of Malebranche&rsquo;s <em>Treatise of Nature and Grace</em>, see
<em>Correspondance et actes (1638&ndash;1689)</em>, recueillis et

<em>OM</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 There is an ambiguity in Malebranche&rsquo;s use of the phrase
&ldquo;occasional cause.&rdquo; Sometimes he uses it to refer to a
<em>thing</em> on the occasion of whose action God causes another
event to occur, and sometimes he uses it to refer to an <em>event</em>
on the occasion of whose occurrence God causes another event to
occur.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 The importance of this theme in Arnauld&rsquo;s criticism of
Malebranche was brought home to me by a recent email exchange with
Steven Nadler. For Nadler&rsquo;s interpretation, see his article,
&ldquo;Arnauld&rsquo;s God,&rdquo; forthcoming.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 The very title of Arnauld&rsquo;s work, <em>Reflexions philosophiques
et th&eacute;ologiques sur le nouveau syst&egrave;me de la Nature et
de la Grace</em>, contains the suggestion that Malebranche failed to
follow a rule he himself took over from Augustine: &ldquo;In
theological matters, novelty has the character of error, and one ought
to look down upon opinions for the simple reason that they are new and
without foundation in tradition&rdquo; (<em>OA</em>, 39:171).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 For a different approach to the connection between &ldquo;the
philosophical debate over ideas and the broader, and (to Arnauld) more
important, theological debate,&rdquo; see Nadler, 1989, pp.
179&ndash;84.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 Steven Nadler seems to disagrees on this point. Nadler says,
&ldquo;Everything points to Arnauld&rsquo;s God being an ultimately
arbitrary deity who does not act for any reason at all--indeed, a
deity who, in His being, transcends practical rationality
altogether&rdquo; [Nadler, 2008, p. 533].</p>

<div id="note-24">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 The phrase, &ldquo;God can act externally only in order to procure an
honor worthy of Himself&rdquo; is Arnauld&rsquo;s paraphrase of #11 of
the <em>Troisi&egrave;me Eclaircissement</em>, in which
Malebranche&rsquo;s words are &ldquo; God can act only for Himself. If
He wills to act, it is because He wills to procure an honor worthy of
Himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>
 For support of Arnauld&rsquo;s interpretation, see Kremer 2000.
Malebranche himself, in his last published work, says explicitly that
the human soul is the &ldquo;true&rdquo; and &ldquo;real&rdquo; cause
of its own free consent to &ldquo;the motives that solicit the
soul,&rdquo; thus allowing an exception to his general principle that
God is the only true efficient cause (<em>R&eacute;flexions sur la
Pr&eacute;motion physique</em>, <em>OM</em>, 16:42&ndash;43).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 Arnauld is referring to St. Thomas, <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, I, 19,
6, ad 1. Aquinas&rsquo; Latin is &ldquo;Magis potest dici velleitas,
quam absoluta voluntas.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>
 In the seventh of <em>Neuf lettres de M. Arnauld contre R. P.
Malebranche</em>, published just before the first two books of
<em>R&eacute;flexions</em>, Arnauld directly attacks Malebranche&rsquo;s
account of <em>grace efficace par elle-m&ecirc;me.</em> He says that
Malebranche&rsquo;s position combines a truth of the Catholic faith with
two errors, one of Luther, the other of Pelagius. The Catholic truth
is that &ldquo;God, through His grace, efficaciously forms in us a
movement of love, which carries us toward Him and toward what we know
is agreeable to Him, for that is the definition that St. Augustine
gives of the grace of Jesus Christ, <em>Inspiratio dilectionis, ut
cognita sancta amore faciamus</em>.&rdquo; But Malebranche holds that
this movement is neither free nor meritorious. Thus he falls into the
error of Luther, who said that the love of God formed in us by grace
is neither free nor meritorious. On the other hand, Malebranche holds
that a person&rsquo;s free consent, the necessary ingredient, so to
speak, which converts the grace of feeling into a free and meritorious
love of God, is not produced by grace. In that way, he falls into the
error of Pelagius, who said that since the actions of Christian piety
are free and meritorious, they are not formed in us by grace.</p>

<p>
Arnauld summarizes his analysis of Malebranche&rsquo;s position:
&ldquo;The cause of this monstrous mixture of truth and error is that
you have distinguished what is from God and grace from what is from
free will, as if one and the same movement of love could not be, and
indeed is not, both from God who forms it in us efficaciously by the
power of His grace, by making us will and love (<em>en nous faisant
vouloir &amp; aimer</em>) what He wants [us to will and love], and
from free will, which loves and wills to love, being moved by
grace&rdquo; (<em>OA</em>, 39:113). He goes on to cite St. Thomas, who
rejects the distinction &ldquo;between what is from grace and what is
from free will, as if they could not be the same&rdquo; (Arnauld
quotes from <em>Summa Theologiae</em>, I, 23, a. 5). The views lying
behind this analysis of Arnauld&rsquo;s are discussed in Section VI
below.</p>

 The &ldquo;two books&rdquo; mentioned by Arnauld appeared separately
in 1685 as Books One and Two of <em>R&eacute;flexions Philosophiques
et Th&eacute;ologiques sur le nouveau syst&egrave;me de la nature et
de la grace</em>. The entire Third Book was published separately in
1686.</p>

 For historical details, see the article, &ldquo;Molinism,&rdquo; by
E. Vansteenberghe, in the <em>Dictionnaire de Th&eacute;ologie
Catholique</em>. The best source in English is the translation of
Molina&rsquo;s <em>On Divine Foreknowledge</em>, with a lengthy
introduction and many notes by Alfred J. Freddoso . The
<em>Congregationes de Auxiliis</em> were the most prolonged and famous
of several disputes at the time about predestination, grace, and free
will. Also important were the censure of seventy-nine propositions of
Baius (Michel du Bay) in 1567 and 1579, and the censure of thirty-one
propositions from the work of the Jesuit Lessius in 1587.</p>

 Arnauld and Jansen disagreed with Ba&ntilde;ez about <em>when</em>
actual grace of the will is intrinsically efficacious. Arnauld and
Jansen held that all actual grace of the will that results from the
merits of Christ, by contrast with any such grace received by Adam and
Eve before the Fall, is intrinsically efficacious with respect to what
God proximately intends. Ba&ntilde;ez, on the other hand, said that
actual grace of the will is intrinsically efficacious in all cases in
which its recipients cooperate with it, and in all such cases its
efficacy is part of God&rsquo;s providential plan; otherwise it is
intrinsically inefficacious.</p>

 Arnauld adds that it would not be prudent to publicize the fact that
he had &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; Jansen on this point.</p>

 Sleigh suggests that by &ldquo;laws of nature&rdquo; Arnauld may have
meant to refer specifically to laws of motion (Sleigh, 1996, p. 174).
Sleigh&rsquo;s suggestion is implausible, however, in light of
Arnauld&rsquo;s statement in <em>Examen</em> that God voluntarily
undertakes to cause in our soul perceptions of sensible qualities
whenever the corresponding motions occur in the sensory organs
&ldquo;according to the laws he himself has established in
nature.&rdquo;</p>

 In this document, Arnauld assembles various passages from St. Thomas
in order to attribute to him the theory of <em>gr&acirc;ce efficace
par elle-m&ecirc;me</em>. Not surprisingly, Arnauld is unable to cite
any passage in which St. Thomas explicitly commits himself to that
theory.</p>

 Arnauld comments that according to this text, &ldquo;God does not
move all men by grace. For [St. Thomas] explicitly affirms, that not
all and always are men moved by grace, but only
&lsquo;<em>specialiter, &amp; interdum, &amp;
aliquos.</em>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

 See especially letters to Vuillaret (21 juin 1692, OA,
3:497&ndash;98) and to Bossuet (juillet 1694, <em>OA</em>,
3:661&ndash;65). In the letter to Vuillaret, Arnauld says, &ldquo;Only
seven or eight years ago I had the occasion to examine deeply the true
opinion of St. Thomas &hellip; I collected everything he said about
[human freedom] in his <em>Summa</em>, and it was on the basis of this
collection that I wrote the little treatise <em>de
libertate</em>.&rdquo; This would put the composition of the treatise
on freedom in 1684 or 1685, when Arnauld was at the point of
publishing <em>R&eacute;flexions.</em> Arnauld also discusses his new
theory in letters to Du Vaucel (3 ao&ucirc;t 1691, <em>OA</em>,
3:364&ndash;66), to Macaire (26 d&eacute;cembre 1691, <em>OA</em>,
3:417&ndash;20), and to Du Vaucel (9 janvier 1693, <em>OA</em>,
3:581&ndash;83).</p>

A translation of Arnauld&rsquo;s Latin text, made by Pasquier Quesnel,
is contained in <em>OA</em>, 10:614&ndash;624, under the title, <em>De
la Libert&eacute; de l&rsquo;homme</em>. The original Latin, <em>Humanae
libertatis notio</em>, is published in Volume 6 of <em>Oeuvres
Philosophiques d&rsquo;Arnauld</em>, edited by Elmar J. Kremer and Denis
Moreau, 2003; and also in <em>Arnauld, Textes philosophiques</em>,
edited by Denis Moreau, 2001.</p>

 In this life here below, one can love God or refrain from doing so,
and hence one freely loves God or not, because one&rsquo;s apprehension
of God is abstract: &ldquo;Because the mind, during this life, knows
God only abstractly &hellip; it can &hellip; attend to some
perfections of God without thinking of others, as when misers, who
consider God only as someone who can make them rich if He wants, can
apprehend Him as their enemy if some extraordinary misfortune befalls
them, and for that reason hate Him or at least not love Him&rdquo;
(<em>Libert&eacute;</em>, <em>OA</em>, 10:618&ndash;19).</p>

 The the expressions &ldquo;<em>potestas ad opposita&rdquo;</em> and
&ldquo;<em>facultas ad opposita</em>&rdquo; don&rsquo;t seem to be found
in St. Thomas. Certainly neither expression occurs in the texts
Arnauld assembled from the <em>Summa Theologiae</em>. However, the
expression, &ldquo;<em>Voluntas se habet ad opposita in his quae ad
finem ordinatur</em>&rdquo; occurs in I&ndash;IIae, 5, 4, ad 2, reproduced
(but mistakenly identified as coming from Part I) in <em>OA
10:629.</em> Similar expressions occur in I, 19, 2, ad 2, and in I,
62, 8, obj. 2 and ad 2.</p>

 In another late text, he adds that if God did not cause human beings
to will freely, He would not be causing them to act in a meritorious
way: &ldquo;But what Scripture, the Fathers, and reason itself say
about the power of God over the wills of men, assumes that He makes
them will in a manner that is conformed to their nature, which is to
will freely. Otherwise he would not make them accomplish His
commandments or work their salvation, things that can only be done by
free volitions&rdquo; (<em>OA</em>, <em>Instruction</em>, 10:436).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-41">41.</a> Michael Della Rocca has pointed
 out (personal communication) that Arnauld here comes very close to
 the position enunciated by Descartes in <em>Principles of
 Philosophy</em>, I, 41.</p>

 Arnauld takes up similar examples in his letters to Mackaire,
Bossuet, adding examples of a highly just judge offered a bribe and an
extremely chaste woman whom someone attempts to seduce.</p>

 Eric Stencil and Julie Walsh (2016) discuss our certainty about how
the prince and the king will act, in the light of what Arnauld says
about habit formation in his criticism of Nicole&rsquo;s theory of
<em>la gr&aacute;ce g&szlig;n&szlig;rale, </em>and his criticism of
the Jesuit distinction between theological and philosophical sin.</p>

<h2>B. Formal Constraints on Similarity</h2>

<p>
In addition to the limit assumption, here is a list of the formal
constraints on similarity that have been proposed, where
\(p,q\subseteq W\) and \(w\in W\):</p>

<div class="figure center" id="ta:selection">

<table class="cellpad-small-dense cell-rl">
<tbody>
<tr id="success">
  <td>(a)</td>
  <td>\(f(w,p)\subseteq p\)</td>
  <td><strong>success</strong></td> </tr>
<tr id="strong-centering">
  <td>(b)</td>
  <td>\(f(w,p)=\{w\}\), if \(w\in p\)</td>
  <td><strong>strong centering</strong></td> </tr>
<tr id="uniformity">
  <td>(c)</td>
  <td>\(f(w,p)\subseteq q\) &amp; \(f(w,q)\subseteq p \;
{\Longrightarrow}\; f(w,p)=f(w,q)\)</td>
  <td><strong>uniformity</strong></td> </tr>
<tr id="uniqueness">
  <td>(d)</td>
  <td>\(f(w,p)\) contains <em>at most</em> one world</td>
  <td><strong>uniqueness</strong></td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Table 5:</span> Candidate Constraints on
Selection Functions</p>
</div>

<p>
While success is discussed in the main entry, (b)&ndash;(d) are
discussed below, followed by the
 <a href="#limit">limit assumption</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="a-strong-centering">B.1 Strong Centering</h3>

<p>

 <a href="#strong-centering">Strong centering</a>
 is motivated, in part, by the intuitive concept of similarity: if
<i>w</i> is already a <i>p</i>-world, then the <i>p</i>-world most
similar to <i>w</i> is <i>w</i> itself. But logical concerns also
motivate its inclusion. Something in the vicinity of strong centering
is needed to validate <em>modus ponens</em>
\((\phi&gt;\psi,\phi\vDash\psi)\), which underwrites reasoning like
 <a href="#e-mp">(59)</a>.</p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="e-mp">(59)</dt>
<dd>
  <dl class="sentag tag15em">
  <dt>a.</dt>
  <dd>If George were caught, he would face years of prison.</dd>

  <dt>b.</dt>
  <dd>Actually, George did get caught.</dd>

  <dt>c.</dt>
  <dd>In that case, he must be facing years of prison.</dd>
  </dl></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Similarly,
 <a href="#strong-centering">strong centering</a>
 validates the principle that a subjunctive conditional is false if
its antecedent is true and consequent false:
\(\phi\land\neg\psi\vDash\neg(\phi&gt;\psi)\). However, <strong>weak
centering</strong> would suffice for both: \(w\in f(w,p)\) if \(w\in
p\). The difference is that strong centering, but not weak centering,
validates:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li id="and-to-if"><strong>Conjunction Conditionalization</strong>
\(\phi\land\psi\vDash\phi&gt;\psi\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
This principle was only meekly promoted by <span class="citation">D.
Lewis (1973b: &sect;1.7</span>, and has attracted objections leading
some to adopt a similarity analysis with only weak centering (e.g.,
<span class="citation">J. Bennett 1974: 387&ndash;8</span>). However,
<span class="citation">Walters and Williams (2013)</span> provide a
very thorough defense of Conjunction Conditionalization and offer a
helpful survey of the objections to it.</p>

<h3 id="a-uniformity">B.2 Uniformity</h3>

<p>
The constraint
 <a href="#uniformity">uniformity</a>
 is somewhat more difficult to state
 intuitively.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-52" id="ref-52">52</a>]</sup>
 But its primary purpose is to validate
 <a href="#SSE">SSE</a>
 <span class="citation">(Stalnaker 1984: 130)</span>, which allows one
to substitute subjunctive equivalents in the antecedent position. It
also bears noting that <em>limited</em> forms of
 <a href="index-2.html#d-Transitivity">Transitivity</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#d-AS">Antecedent Strengthening</a>
 follow directly from
 <a href="#SSE">SSE</a>:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-53" id="ref-53">53</a>]</sup></p>
 
<ul class="hanging">

<li id="SSE"><strong>Substitution of Subjunctive Equivalents
(SSE)</strong>
\(\phi_1&gt;\phi_2,\phi_2&gt;\phi_1,\phi_1&gt;\psi\vDash
\phi_2&gt;\psi\)</li>
</ul>

<ul class="hanging">

<li id="LT"><strong>Limited Transitivity (LT)</strong>
\(\phi_1&gt;\phi_2,(\phi_1\land\phi_2)&gt;\psi\vDash
\phi_1&gt;\psi\)</li>
</ul>

<ul class="hanging">

<li id="LAS"><strong>Limited Antecedent Strengthening (LAS)</strong>
\(\phi_1&gt;\phi_2,\neg(\phi_1&gt;\neg\psi)\vDash(\phi_1\land\phi_2)&gt;\psi\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
The intuitive appeal of
 <a href="#SSE">SSE</a>
 is fairly clear: </p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(60)</dt>
<dd><dl class="sentag tag15em">
  <dt>a.</dt>
  <dd>If Simone had drummed, Jean-Paul would have danced.</dd>
  <dt>b.</dt>
  <dd>If Jean-Paul had danced, Simone would have drummed.</dd>
  <dt>c.</dt>
  <dd>If Simone had drummed, Claude would have stayed for another drink.</dd>
  <dt>d.</dt>
  <dd>So, if Jean-Paul had danced, Claude would have stayed for another drink.</dd>
  </dl></dd>
</dl>


<p>

 <a href="#LT">LT</a>
 and
 <a href="#LAS">LAS</a>
 are also important since they provide one way the similarity analysis
could explain the fact that some instances of
 <a href="index-2.html#d-Transitivity">Transitivity</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#d-AS">Antecedent Strengthening</a>
 sound compelling. If the similarity theorist can motivate the claim
that the premises of these instances are being interpreted in the
manner of
 <a href="#LAS">LAS</a>
 rather than
 <a href="index-2.html#d-AS">Antecedent Strengthening</a>,
 then these cases can be explained.</p>

<p>
<span class="citation">Pollock (1976, 1981: 254)</span> rejects
 <a href="#uniformity">uniformity</a>
 and endorses an even weaker logic. <span class="citation">Pollock
(1981: 254)</span> does so on the basis of a counterexample to
 <a href="#LAS">LAS</a>.
 In the example, there is a circuit where three switches
(\(S_1,S_2,S_3\)) control two lights (\(L_1,L_2\)). \(L_1\) comes on
either when \(S_1\) is up or when \(S_2\) and \(S_3\) are both up.
\(L_2\) comes on when \(S_1\) is up or when \(S_2\) is up. (\(S_3\) is
not connected to \(L_2\) in any way.) Now suppose that all three
switches are down and both lights are off. Both
 <a href="#e-L2-then-notS3">(61a)</a>
 and
 <a href="#e-not-L2-then-notL1">(61b)</a>
 are intuitively true. What about
 <a href="#e-L2andnotS3-then-L1">(61c)</a>?
 </p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(61)</dt>
<dd><dl class="sentag tag15em">
  <dt id="e-L2-then-notS3">a.</dt>
  <dd>\(S_3\) would (still) be down if \(L_2\) were on.
      <br/>
      \(\mathsf{L_2>\neg S_3}\)</dd>
  <dt id="e-not-L2-then-notL1">b.</dt>
  <dd>It's not true that if \(L_2\) were on, \(L_1\) would be off. (\(L_2\) might be on because \(S_1\) is up.)
     <br/>
     \(\mathsf{\neg(L_2>\neg L_1)}\)</dd>
  <dt id="e-L2andnotS3-then-L1">c.</dt>
  <dd>\(L_1\) would be on if \(L_2\) were on and \(S_3\) were down.
      <br/>
      \(\mathsf{(L_2\land \neg S_3)>L_1}\) </dd>
  </dl></dd>
</dl>

<p>
\(S_3\) would (still) be down if \(L_2\) and \(L_1\) were on. <span class="citation">Pollock
(1981)</span> contends that
 <a href="#e-L2andnotS3-then-L1">(61c)</a>
 makes the wrong prediction in a scenario where \(S_1\) and \(S_3\)
stay down but \(S_2\) is flipped up. Then \(L_2\) will be on and
\(S_3\) will be down, but \(L_1\) will be off. <span class="citation">Pollock
(1981: &sect;2)</span> maintains that this
failure of
 <a href="#uniformity">uniformity</a>
 motivates an account in terms of minimal change instead of one in
terms of maximal similarity. This counterexample has received little
attention, perhaps because it is sufficiently complex to make
intuitions less clear. It is also worth noting that rejecting
uniformity makes it harder to explain why some instances of antecedent
monotonic patterns sound compelling.</p>

<h3 id="a-uniqueness">B.3 Uniqueness</h3>

<p>
According to
 <a href="#uniqueness">uniqueness</a>,
 there is always a unique most similar \(\phi\)-world when evaluating
\(\phi&gt;\psi\). For such a simple principle, uniqueness has
stimulated a surprisingly complex debate, beginning with
Stalnaker&rsquo;s (<span class="citation">1968: 46</span>) endorsement
and Lewis&rsquo; (<span class="citation">1973b: &sect;3.4</span>)
rejection of it. This debate centers on two issues: the fact that
 <a href="#uniqueness">uniqueness</a>
 (together with the
 <a href="#limit">limit assumption</a>
 discussed below) entails
 <a href="#CEM">Conditional Excluded Middle</a>
 and the fact that uniqueness impacts one&rsquo;s analysis of
subjunctive conditionals containing <em>might</em> in the consequent.
Consider first
 <a href="#CEM">Conditional Excluded Middle</a>
 and two consequences,
 <a href="#CN">CN</a>
 and
 <a href="#CD">CD</a>:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-54" id="ref-54">54</a>]</sup></p>
 
<ul class="hanging">

<li id="CEM"><strong>Conditional Excluded Middle (CEM)</strong>
<br/>
\(\vDash (\phi&gt;\psi)\lor(\phi&gt;\neg\psi)\)</li>
</ul>

<ul class="hanging">

<li id="CN"><strong>Conditional Negation (CN)</strong>
<br/>
\({\Diamond}\phi\land\neg(\phi&gt;\psi)\,\leftmodels\vDash
{\Diamond}\phi\land\phi&gt;\neg\psi\)</li>
</ul>

<ul class="hanging">

<li id="CD"><strong>Consequent Distribution (CD)</strong>
<br/>
\(\phi&gt;(\psi_1\lor\psi_2)\vDash(\phi&gt;\psi_1)\lor(\phi&gt;\psi_2)\)</li>
</ul>

<p>

 <a href="#uniqueness">Uniqueness</a>
 leads to
 <a href="#CEM">CEM</a>,
 since if there is a unique most similar \(\phi\)-world it is either a
\(\psi\)-world&mdash;in which case the left disjunct is true&mdash;or
it is a \(\neg\psi\)-world&mdash;in which case the right disjunct is
true. A natural concern, voiced by <span class="citation">D. Lewis
(1973b: &sect;3.4)</span>, is that there might be a tie among a
\(\psi\)-world and a \(\neg\psi\)-world for being the most similar
\(\phi\)-world.</p>

<p>
Consider the antecedent <em>If I were older...</em> What is my age in
the unique most similar world where I am older? One might be tempted
to deny both
 <a href="#e-35-a">(62a)</a>
 and
 <a href="#e-35-b">(62b)</a>,
 instead affirming
 <a href="#e-35-c">(62c)</a>.</p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(62)</dt>
<dd><dl class="sentag tag15em">
  <dt id="e-35-a">a.</dt>
  <dd>If I were older, I would be 35. </dd>
  <dt id="e-35-b">b.</dt>
  <dd>If I were older, I wouldn't be 35. </dd>
  <dt id="e-35-c">c.</dt>
  <dd>If I were older, I might be 35. And, if I were older, I might not be 35.</dd>
  </dl></dd>
</dl>

<p>
It seems appealing that all worlds where I am older than my present
age, say 32, are tied. The advocate of
 <a href="#uniqueness">uniqueness</a>
 has two problems here. First, they cannot deny both
 <a href="#e-35-a">(62a)</a>
 and
 <a href="#e-35-b">(62b)</a>,
 since by
 <a href="#CEM">CEM</a>
 at least one of them is true. Second, it is unclear what they can say
about the meaning of
 <a href="#e-35-c">(62c)</a>.
 It is tempting to say, as <span class="citation">D. Lewis (1973b:
&sect;1.5)</span> does, that a <em>might</em> subjunctive is true when
<em>some</em> of the most similar antecedent worlds are consequent
worlds. But if there is a unique most similar antecedent world, the
difference between requiring <em>all</em> for <em>would</em>
subjunctives and <em>some</em> for <em>might</em> subjunctives
collapses.</p>

<p>
<span class="citation">Stalnaker (1980, 1984: Ch.7)</span> responds to
both challenges. He begins by highlighting favorable data for
 <a href="#CEM">CEM</a>,
 contending, as <span class="citation">D. Lewis (1973b:
&sect;3.4)</span> grants, that
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-c">(63c)</a>
 sounds inconsistent with
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-a">(63a)</a>
 and
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-b">(63b)</a>.</p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt>(63)</dt>
<dd><dl class="sentag tag15em">
  <dt id="e-pro-cem-a">a.</dt>
  <dd>It's not true that if I were older, I would be 35.
      <br/>
      \(\mathsf{\neg(O>T)}\) </dd>
  <dt id="e-pro-cem-b">b.</dt>
  <dd>And, it's not true that if I were older, I wouldn't be 35.
      <br/>
      \(\mathsf{\neg(O>\neg T)}\) </dd>
  <dt id="e-pro-cem-c">c.</dt>
  <dd>But, if I were older, I either would or would not be 35.
      <br/>
      \(\mathsf{\neg(O>(T\lor\neg T))}\) </dd>
  </dl></dd>
</dl>

<p>
But
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-c">(63c)</a>
 is only inconsistent with
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-a">(63a)</a>
 and
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-b">(63b)</a>
 when
 <a href="#CEM">CEM</a>
 is assumed. This is easy to see from the fact that CEM entails
 <a href="#CD">CD</a>,
 and by CD
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-c">(63c)</a>
 entails \(\mathsf{(O&gt;T)\lor(O&gt;\neg T)}\), which is clearly
inconsistent with
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-a">(63a)</a>
 and
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-b">(63b)</a>.
 And, yet, CEM also conflicts with our intuition that
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-a">(63a)</a>
 and
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-b">(63b)</a>
 are consistent with each other. <span class="citation">Stalnaker
(1980, 1984: Ch. 7)</span> proposes to treat such cases as vagueness
in the similarity of worlds, on par with the vagueness of color
gradients where one might be tempted to deny both that a certain patch
is red and that it is not red. The basic idea is that there is
indeterminacy in the selection function being used and under one
resolution
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-a">(63a)</a>
 is true while under another
 <a href="#e-pro-cem-b">(63b)</a>
 is true. <span class="citation">Stalnaker (1980, 1984: Ch.7)</span>
sketches a view along these lines using the supervaluational <span class="citation">Fraassen
(1966)</span> approach to vagueness. The
remaining challenge, then, is to formulate an approach to
<em>might</em> subjunctives like
 <a href="#e-35-c">(62c)</a>
 which is compatible with
 <a href="#uniqueness">uniqueness</a>.
 <span class="citation">Stalnaker (1980, 1984: Ch.7)</span> develops
just such an account.</p>

<p>
For the advocate of
 <a href="#uniqueness">uniqueness</a>,
 it is difficult to treat <em>might</em> subjunctives as involving a
subjunctive conditional whose consequent is an existentially
quantified modal. Since the antecedent delivers a single most similar
world, it is not possible to truth-conditionally distinguish a
universal from an existential quantifier over the antecedent worlds.
Thus, a <em>might</em> or <em>could</em> and a <em>would</em> will
come to the same
 thing.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-55" id="ref-55">55</a>]</sup>
 As a result, <span class="citation">Stalnaker (1980, 1984:
Ch.7)</span> pursues an analysis where <em>might</em> takes scope over
the entire subjunctive conditional and expresses a kind of epistemic
possibility. <span class="citation">Stalnaker (1984:
43&ndash;44)</span> motivates this by observing that
 <a href="#e-stalnaker-might-b">(64b)</a>
 seems equivalent to
 <a href="#e-stalnaker-might-a">(64a)</a>.</p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag3em">

    <dd>It might be that if John had been invited, he would have come to the
party. </dd>
     </dl></dd>
</dl>

<p>
<span class="citation">Stalnaker (1984: 144&ndash;146)</span> goes on
to present examples to support this analysis and compare it favorably
with Lewis&rsquo; (<span class="citation">1973b:
&sect;1.5</span>).</p>

<p>
The debate regarding
 <a href="#CEM">CEM</a>
 has continued to attract arguments on each side. <span class="citation">Bennett
(2003: &sect;&sect;72,73,76)</span> presents
a sustained critique of CEM, while <span class="citation">Williams
(2010)</span> responds on its behalf. <span class="citation">Fintel
and Iatridou (2002)</span> examine quantified conditionals and suggest
that a semantics which validates CEM is needed. <span class="citation">Klinedinst
(2011)</span> develops this argument
further against intervening disputes. <span class="citation">Swanson
(2012)</span> shows that the supervaluationist approach can also be
applied to handle failures of the limit assumption, thereby allowing
for a theory that validates CEM despite having mechanisms for treating
failures of both
 <a href="#uniqueness">uniqueness</a>
 and the
 <a href="#limit">limit assumption</a>.</p>
 
<p>
There is another issue raised by the discussion of <em>might</em>
conditionals which has attracted much attention. There is an imperfect
match between the representation language being used and English. The
connective &ldquo;\(&gt;\)&rdquo; builds in <em>would</em>, and
<em>might</em> subjunctives contain no <em>would</em>. Rather than
being analyzed as a <em>might</em> scoping over a <em>would</em>
conditional <span class="citation">Stalnaker 1980, 1984: Ch.7)</span>
or a distinct conditional connective <span class="citation">(D. Lewis
1973b: &sect;1.5)</span>, it would be more accurate to have an
analysis that separates the contribution of conditionals in general
from the modals that interact with them. This is not an idle
linguistic issue. Neither <span class="citation">(Stalnaker 1984:
Ch.7)</span> nor <span class="citation">(D. Lewis 1973b:
&sect;1.5)</span> can capture examples like
 <a href="#e-mixed">(65)</a>.</p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="e-mixed">(65)</dt>
<dd>If John had come to the party, he would have had a drink and he might
have liked it.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Scoping the <em>might</em> over the conditional would erase the
crucial distinction made in the consequent: John definitely would have
had a drink, but there&rsquo;s only a chance that he would have liked
 it.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-56" id="ref-56">56</a>]</sup>
 These issues can only be addressed by a more serious engagement with
the research discussed in the supplement
 <a href="conditionals.html">Indicative and Subjunctive Conditionals</a>,
 especially Kratzer&rsquo;s (<span class="citation">1981a,
1991</span>) general approach to modality and conditionals.</p>

<h3 id="a-limit-assumption">B.4 The Limit Assumption</h3>

<p>
The basic idea of the
 <a href="#limit">limit assumption</a>
 is that there is are most similar antecedent worlds:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li id="limit"><strong>Limit Assumption</strong> As one proceeds to
\(\phi\)-worlds more and more similar to <i>w</i>, one hits a limit
and cannot get to a \(\phi\)-world any more similar to <i>w</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
While <span class="citation">Stalnaker (1968, 1980)</span> accepts
this assumption, <span class="citation">D. Lewis (1973b: 20)</span>
rejects it. <span class="citation">D. Lewis (1973b: 20)</span>
provides the following rationale. Consider this 1 inch line:</p>

\[\rule{1in}{.3ex}\]

<p>
Suppose, counterfactually, that this line were more than an inch long.
How long is it in the world most similar to our own? For any length of
line and corresponding world \(1+x\), there is a real number
\(y&lt;x\) such that the line is \(1+y\) in some other world. This
other world is yet more similar to our own, since the line is closer
to its actual length. <span class="citation">D. Lewis (1973b:
20)</span> grants that this is not a decisive objection, but suggests
that it is better to formulate a theory of counterfactuals which does
not essentially depend on the limit assumption to operate. <span class="citation">D.
Lewis (1973c: 423&ndash;4)</span> prefers an
analysis according to which \(\phi&gt;\psi\) is true in <i>w</i> just
in case some \(\phi\land\psi\)-world is more similar to <i>w</i> than
any \(\phi\land\neg\psi\)-world, if there are any \(\phi\)-worlds.
This analysis can be formalized in terms of a three-place comparative
similarity relation over worlds that is subject to constraints
analogous to those devised for selection functions <span class="citation">(D.
Lewis 1973b: &sect;2.3)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span class="citation">Stalnaker (1980, 1984: 141&ndash;142)</span>
replies that in most contexts not every minute difference will count
towards the similarity of antecedent worlds. <span class="citation">Stalnaker
(1968)</span> and <span class="citation">D.
Lewis (1973b)</span> share the commitment that the respects which
matter for similarity are radically context-sensitive. Thus, in cases
like the line, they both seem to agree that there will be a threshold
below which differences don&rsquo;t matter. <span class="citation">Stalnaker
1980, 1984: 141&ndash;142)</span> contends
that this threshold provides the limit needed to safely make the
 <a href="#limit">limit assumption</a>.
 In the context of the line, the threshold is likely the smallest unit
of measure which people can be assumed to care about, e.g., a
millimeter. As for contexts where <em>every</em> difference matters,
<span class="citation">Stalnaker (1984: 141&ndash;142)</span> says
that it is inappropriate to use imprecise antecedents like <em>if this
line were more than an inch long</em>, much as it is inappropriate to
use a definite description like <em>the shortest lines longer than an
inch</em>. If correct, this response eliminates the need to
countenance failures of the
 <a href="#limit">limit assumption</a>.
 However, <span class="citation">Swanson (2012)</span> shows that even
if one must countenance such failures, there is a supervaluationist
method&mdash;extending considerably Stalnaker&rsquo;s (<span class="citation">1980</span>)&mdash;for
treating them within a theory
that makes the
 <a href="#limit">limit assumption</a>.</p>
 
<p>
<span class="citation">Pollock (1976: 20)</span> and <span class="citation">Herzberger
(1979)</span> also highlight one advantage
of making the
 <a href="#limit">limit assumption</a>.
 All theories on offer agree that if \(\phi_1&gt;\phi_2\) is true and
\(\phi_2\vDash\psi\) then \(\phi_1&gt;\psi\) is true. And, they agree
that if \(\phi_1&gt;\phi_2,{\ldots},\phi_1&gt;\phi_n\) are true and
\(\phi_2,{\ldots},\phi_n\vDash\psi\) then \(\phi_1&gt;\psi\) is true.
But what about the more general version: where
\(\Gamma={\{\phi_2,\phi_3,{\ldots}\}}\), if
\(\phi_1&gt;\phi_2,\phi_1&gt;\phi_3,{\ldots}\) are true and
\(\Gamma\vDash\psi\) then \(\phi_1&gt;\psi\) is true? The more general
version only holds when the
 <a href="#limit">limit assumption</a>
 is made. The appeal of this general consequence principle, plus the
above resources, mean that the
 <a href="#limit">limit assumption</a>
 is often safely made in discussion of counterfactuals. If for nothing
else, this assumption often simplifies already complex formal
definitions. However, <span class="citation">Kaufmann (2017)</span>
demonstrated a rather important caveat: formalizing the Limit
Assumption reveals it to be not one assumption, but a family of
assumptions which must be stated differently depending on other
features of the formalization. While the formulations of it given in
<span class="citation">D. Lewis (1973b)</span> are accurate given
certain assumptions about the underlying ordering relations, different
formulations are required when those assumptions are changed.</p>

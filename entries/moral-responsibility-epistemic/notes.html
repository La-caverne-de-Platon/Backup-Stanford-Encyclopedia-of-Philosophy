<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">The Epistemic Condition for Moral Responsibility</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Although the philosophical orthodoxy is that the control and
epistemic conditions are distinct (Fischer &amp; Ravizza 1998:
12&ndash;3), some philosophers claim that the latter is in fact a
component of the former (Mele 2010; Levy 2011: ch. 5; Nelkin &amp;
Rickless 2017a). Other philosophers take the more radical line of
denying the existence of a distinctive epistemic condition on moral
responsibility (Bj&ouml;rnsson 2017a; Graham 2017; Holly Smith 2017:
99&ndash;102).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Zimmerman (1997: 419&ndash;20; 2002b: 560&ndash;1) denies that the
consequences of one&rsquo;s actions&mdash;even those that are actually
foreseen&mdash;add anything to the agent&rsquo;s <em>degree</em> of
blameworthiness, over and above the degree that accrues to her in
virtue of deciding to perform a wrong action (see also Graham 2014).
According to Zimmerman, the occurrence of foreseen consequences
augments only the <em>scope</em> of the agent&rsquo;s responsibility,
i.e. she&rsquo;s to blame <em>for</em> more things, but that
doesn&rsquo;t mean that she&rsquo;s <em>more</em> blameworthy than she
would be had those consequences never occurred. See Domsky 2004 (453,
n.13) for criticism of the degree/scope distinction.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Levy (2014: 33) claims that awareness consists in the relevant
information being <em>personally available</em> rather than
<em>dispositionally available</em>, where personal availability occurs
when the agent is able &ldquo;to effortlessly and easily&rdquo;
retrieve information she holds dispositionally for its use in
reasoning. Since some dispositional information can&rsquo;t be
retrieved effortlessly and easily, not all such information is
personally available in Levy&rsquo;s sense. It&rsquo;s worth pointing
out a significant change in Levy&rsquo;s position concerning the EC.
In <em>Hard Luck</em> (2011: chs. 5 &amp; 6) Levy sides with Zimmerman
and Rosen and defends the idea that occurrent and <em>de dicto</em>
awareness of wrongdoing is necessary for blameworthiness. However, in
<em>Consciousness and Moral Responsibility</em> (2014) he clearly
denies the necessity of occurrent beliefs for blameworthiness (2014:
31) and, more importantly, he emphasizes that the content of the
requisite awareness involves &ldquo;consciousness <em>of the
facts</em> that give our actions their moral significance&rdquo;
(2014: 14, italics added), which strongly suggests that what matters
for responsibility in his revised view is <em>de re</em>, not <em>de
dicto</em>, awareness.</p>

 Philosophers distinguish three main varieties of ignorance: mistaken,
suspending, and deep ignorance (Guerrero 2007: 63; van Woudenberg
2009: 375; Peels 2014: 485; Wieland 2017b: 159). Mistaken ignorance
occurs when the agent has a mistaken belief about a relevant aspect of
her action or circumstances (as in John&rsquo;s case, who mistakenly
believes that the button is a light switch and so mistakenly believes
that it&rsquo;s permissible for him to press it). Suspending ignorance
occurs when the agent wonders whether her action has a certain
relevant feature which as a matter of fact it does have (e.g., that it might cause harm) but ends up
suspending belief on the matter. Finally, deep ignorance occurs when
the agent has never even considered whether her action has a relevant
feature it in fact has (e.g., the ancient slaveholder who has never
considered the possibility that slavery is wrong [Rosen 2003]). Both
Guerrero (2007) and Peels (2014) argue that different kinds of
ignorance have different exculpatory potentials. For instance,
Guerrero claims that if a person wonders whether her action is wrong
but fails to make up her mind&mdash;thus being in a state of
suspending ignorance&mdash;and yet performs it, her ignorance, even if
blameless, doesn&rsquo;t provide an excuse if it turns out that the
action is in fact wrong or if, for all the agent knew, this could have
been the case (Guerrero 2007: 78). By contrast, if the person is
mistakenly ignorant of the action&rsquo;s wrongness and she
isn&rsquo;t blameworthy for her mistaken belief, her ignorance does
provide an excuse (2007: 62).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 It&rsquo;s important to note that even though John&rsquo;s ignorance
is primarily factual in nature&mdash;since it&rsquo;s rooted in a
mistaken factual belief about the button&rsquo;s function&mdash;it
ramifies in <em>normative</em> ignorance as well, because, as a
consequence of his mistaken factual belief, John is also ignorant of
the normative consideration <em>that he shouldn&rsquo;t press the
button</em> or <em>that it&rsquo;s wrong to press the button</em>.
Thus, we can say that John&rsquo;s normative ignorance is
&ldquo;impure&rdquo;, given that it&rsquo;s rooted in factual
ignorance. By contrast, the next variant of the example discussed in
the text is a case of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; normative ignorance, where
the agent&rsquo;s mistaken normative belief isn&rsquo;t rooted in any
factual error. See Wieland (2017b: 150) for the closely related distinction between
pure and impure moral ignorance.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Levy (2011: ch. 6) pursues this eliminativist project about
responsibility to its fullest, since he claims that not even akratic
wrongdoers are blameworthy. This is because, on his view, it turns out
either that akratic wrongdoers act from ignorance after all or that
their actions are subject to responsibility-undermining luck.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Many philosophers note an important difference between, on the one
hand, acting <em>from</em> or <em>out of</em> ignorance and, on the
other, acting <em>in</em> ignorance or <em>while</em> ignorant
(Zimmerman 1997: 424; Guerrero 2007: 62&ndash;3; Peels 2014: 479). The
notion of acting from ignorance conveys the idea that &ldquo;the
ignorance played an important causal or explanatory role in the agent
actually performing the act in question&rdquo; (Guerrero 2007: 63),
i.e., the agent performed the action <em>because</em> she was ignorant
of relevant considerations, which entails that she wouldn&rsquo;t have
performed it had she known better. By contrast, acting in ignorance or
while ignorant conveys the idea that, although the agent was unaware
of relevant considerations at the time of action, she would have acted
in exactly the same way had she not been unaware of them. The usual
assumption is that only actions performed out of ignorance can (with the usual caveat about culpable ignorance) be
excused (cf. Rosen 2008: 598n.14).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Bj&ouml;rnsson (2017b: 154&ndash;5) claims that the ancient
slaveholder is less blameworthy than a contemporary slaveholder
because, given the former&rsquo;s social context, it was harder for
her to display the appropriate level of moral concern (see also
Wieland 2017b: 153). So, on his view, evinced quality of will is not
all that matters for blameworthiness; also relevant is how difficult
it&rsquo;s for the agent to display the appropriate level of concern.
For a thorough discussion of different kinds of difficulty relevant
for ascriptions of responsibility, also focused on the case of the
ancient slaveholder, see Guerrero 2017.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Quite apart from the discussion centered on the regress argument,
there is a whole subliterature devoted to the question whether ancient
slaveholders and other morally ignorant wrongdoers whose moral
ignorance can be explained by their cultural context are blameworthy
or not. Three classic pieces on this topic are Wolf 1987, Calhoun
1989, and Moody-Adams 1994. The first two defend the view that such
ignorance can be non-culpable and (with some caveats in
Calhoun&rsquo;s case) can exculpate, whereas the third defends the
contrary view that moral ignorance is usually &ldquo;affected&rdquo;
and therefore doesn&rsquo;t exculpate. For critical discussions of
these views, in particular of Moody-Adams&rsquo; affected ignorance
thesis, see Isaacs 1997, Benson 2001, Levy 2003, Pleasants 2008,
Peacock 2011, and Wieland 2017c. See also Fricker 2010 and Mason &amp;
Wilson 2017 for a pair of opposing views on the question whether
widespread moral ignorance can be blameworthy.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 FitzPatrick (2008 &amp; 2017) can be classified as a capacitarian
because a key element of his view is that culpability for ignorant
wrongdoing is partially explained by the fact that the agent should
and could have avoided or corrected her ignorance, given her
capacities and the opportunities provided by her social context (see
sect. 3.2). However, FitzPatrick&rsquo;s position differs from other
capacitarian views in three important ways. First, he accepts thesis i
of the regress argument, i.e., that culpability for ignorant
wrongdoing always derives from culpability for the underlying
ignorance. Second, he claims that culpable ignorance (and thus
culpability for ignorant wrongdoing) is ultimately grounded on
epistemically vicious conduct. Third, unlike other capacitarians, he
thinks that in &ldquo;forgetting cases&rdquo; of unwitting wrongdoing
(such as the one discussed immediately in the text) agents
aren&rsquo;t blameworthy (FitzPatrick 2017: 38&ndash;9).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Capacitarians aren&rsquo;t interested only in forgetting cases; rather, they
attempt to explain blameworthiness for unwitting wrongdoing generally, and the latter can be prompted by a wide array of cognitive failures besides episodes of forgetfulness, such as: failures to notice relevant features of one&rsquo;s
situation, such as a stop sign (Clarke 2017a) or one&rsquo;s audience
discomfort regarding the anecdote one is telling (Sher 2009: 27);
failures to foresee the risk of harm one&rsquo;s action poses to
others, as when a bricklayer throws down some materials into the
street without even looking (Clarke 2014: 160) or a driver imprudently
merges into a busy highway (Sher 2009: 26); failures to keep
one&rsquo;s attention focused on the task at hand, as when a ferry
pilot indulges in daydreaming and fails to steer the ferry clear of
some rocks (Sher 2009: 26); failures to realize the morally bad
implications of one&rsquo;s behavior, as when a teacher grants too
many opportunities to earn extra credit only to students who ask for
it (Sher 2009: 28); or even failures to remain awake, as when a
soldier on duty falls asleep leaving the compound unguarded (Sher
2009: 26). As Sher (idem) observes, some of these
cases&mdash;especially those involving failures to foresee the risk of
harm&mdash;overlap with the moral and legal category of negligence, which means
that what philosophers and legal theorists have to say about
negligence is directly relevant here. See for example
Hart (1961 [2008]), Zimmerman (1986), Sverdlik (1993), Finkelstein
(2005), Alexander &amp; Ferzan (2009: ch. 3), King (2009), Raz (2011),
Husak (2011), Moore &amp; Hurd (2011), and Clarke (2014: ch. 7).
Finally, it&rsquo;s important to point out that even if some cases of
unwitting wrongdoing are partially explicable in terms of character
defects (Sher 2009: 90&ndash;1; Moore &amp; Hurd 2011: 164&ndash;5),
they usually have something important in common with forgetting cases, namely that the
agents&rsquo; culpability can&rsquo;t be traced back to a knowing
failure to discharge some duty, in this case related to improving
one&rsquo;s character (Sher 2009: 38&ndash;9; see also Vargas 2005).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Murray&rsquo;s (2017) notion of &lsquo;norms of vigilance&rsquo; can
be understood as carving up a middle ground between norms of awareness
and duties of inquiry, since in his view norms of vigilance issue
obligations that make demands &ldquo;on how much effort one ought to
devote to paying attention&rdquo; (2017: 514). Paying attention is an
activity, not merely a state of mind, and yet it isn&rsquo;t an
information-gathering activity of the sort demanded by duties of
inquiry.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Sher (2009: 142&ndash;3) briefly explains how the origination
relation can be satisfied in the case of praiseworthy actions
performed in ignorance of their rightness. Relying on Arpaly&rsquo;s (2003: 75&ndash;7)
analysis of the case of Huckleberry Finn, Sher claims that an agent
satisfies the EC for right actions if, despite her unawareness of the
action&rsquo;s rightness, she has made &ldquo;enough cognitive
contact&rdquo; with the action&rsquo;s right-making features so as to
be able to act on their basis.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Clarke&rsquo;s (2014; 2017a, b) account of blameworthiness for
unwitting wrongdoing has a lot in common with Sher&rsquo;s. Unlike
Sher, however, Clarke thinks that the fact that an agent should and
could have known better (thus satisfying the EC), together with the
fact that she was able to perform the right action (thus satisfying
the freedom or control condition), suffices for explaining direct
blameworthiness for unwitting wrongdoing (Clarke 2014: 167; 2017a:
244; see also Murray 2017: 524). Thus, Clarke dispenses
with Sher&rsquo;s origination requirement (Clarke 2017b: 75). However,
this more minimal capacitarian account of blameworthiness for
unwitting wrongdoing hasn&rsquo;t escaped criticism. Talbert (2017a:
58&ndash;9) insists that moral blame isn&rsquo;t appropriate unless
the offending agent exhibits ill will; the mere fact that she should
and could have known (and done) better isn&rsquo;t sufficient. He
concedes that &ldquo;while feelings of disappointment and frustration
might be appropriate&rdquo; regarding wrongs unwittingly brought about
by agents lacking ill will, &ldquo;resentment would not be&rdquo;
(2017a: 59). Similarly, Zimmerman (2017: 86&ndash;7) objects to the
idea of grounding moral culpability &ldquo;in a non-moral
aberration&rdquo; such as the cognitive failure to recall some
relevant consideration, claiming that &ldquo;[i]f the aberration is
not a moral one, then it does not reflect some morally objectionable
aspect of [the agent&rsquo;s] quality of will.&rdquo; (Clarke briefly
addresses the quality-of-will objection to his account in his 2017a:
246 and 2017b: 76&ndash;7.) In turn, Levy (2017: 255) takes issue with
Clarke&rsquo;s rendering of both the EC and the freedom condition.
Concerning the EC, Levy denies that it&rsquo;s reasonable to expect
unwitting wrongdoers to recall or notice relevant considerations,
because the cognitive capacities involved aren&rsquo;t under their
control and so whether they in fact recall or notice involves &ldquo;a
chance occurrence&rdquo; that can&rsquo;t ground reasonable
expectations. Concerning the freedom condition, Levy claims that since
unwitting wrongdoers can&rsquo;t do the right thing by way of a
reasoning procedure (as opposed to a chance occurrence), they
aren&rsquo;t free in omitting to do it (Clarke responds to the latter
point in his 2017a: 249&ndash;50). Relatedly, Nelkin and Rickless
(2015; 2017a: 127&ndash;8) observe that in cases of unwitting
omissions merely being <em>able</em> (in a general as opposed to a
specific sense of ability) to perform the right action doesn&rsquo;t
amount to a robust enough form of control of the sort that could justify blame, for it
isn&rsquo;t clear in what sense &ldquo;it remains up to me&rdquo;
(Clarke 2014: 115) to do what I unwittingly failed to.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 In his account of culpability for negligence, Joseph Raz (2011)
suggests that what grounds blameworthiness in cases of unwitting
wrongdoing is both the fact that we are non-derivatively responsible
for conduct that results from &ldquo;the functioning, successful or
failed, of our powers of rational agency&rdquo; (2011: 268)
<em>and</em> also our interest in acknowledging responsibility in
these cases, for in doing the latter &ldquo;we affirm our mastery of
these abilities, deny that we are disabled in the relevant
regards&rdquo; (idem). While the first part of Raz&rsquo;s account
resembles the accounts of Sher and Clarke, the second part
adds something new. Building on Raz&rsquo;s suggestion, Murray and
Vargas 2018
 (<a href="index-2.html#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a>)
 argue that responsibility for unwitting omissions can be partially
explained by appealing to &ldquo;the value of self-control.&rdquo;
Roughly, they claim that our various self-conceptions require that we
exhibit a certain degree of competence regarding their characteristic
activities. When we make mistakes (including unwitting ones) in these
domains, a threat to our involved self-conception arises, and a way of
defusing this threat is precisely to accept responsibility for
disappointing the relevant expectations. By doing so, the agent
signals to herself and others that she&rsquo;s competent and reliable
after all, and thus reaffirms her willingness to be assessed in light
of the pertinent norms. It remains an interesting open question
whether this <em>forward-looking</em> interest agents have in
acknowledging responsibility for unwitting wrongdoing provides the
needed morally plausibly desert basis for <em>backward-looking</em>
blame.</p>

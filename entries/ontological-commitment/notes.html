<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Ontological Commitment</a></h2>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a> See Van Inwagen (1998),
who coined the term &lsquo;meta-ontology&rsquo;. Hofweber (2013) draws
the border between ontology and meta-ontology somewhat
differently.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a> Similar statements of the
criterion occur in Quine (1951a: 11, 1951b: 67, 1953: 103, 1960:
242). Quine sometimes uses the slogan: &ldquo;to be is to the value of
a variable&rdquo; (Quine 1948: 15). But the lack of explicit reference
to a theory has the potential to mislead.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a> Quine's view as to exactly
how names should be eliminated in favor of predicates evolved over the
years. See Graff Fara (2011).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>  Michaels (2008: 46)
writes: &ldquo;the [existential] claims themselves are the ontological
commitments&rdquo;. But taking ontological commitment
to <em>be</em>&mdash;not just be analyzed in terms of&mdash;an
entailment relation to &ldquo;claims&rdquo; (or
&ldquo;statements&rdquo; or &ldquo;propositions&rdquo;), in addition
to disagreeing with common usage, fails to solve the problem of
ontological neutrality; for claims, statements, propositions, and the
like are no less controversial entities than kinds.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>  Perhaps the special case
is all we need if we go on to say: a theory is ontologically committed
to whatever the existential sentences that it logically entails are
committed to. </p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>  Extensional
interpretations of Quine's criterion were shown to be inadequate early
on in Cartwright (1954) and Scheffler and Chomsky (1958). See also Parsons
(1970).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>  Single quotes should be
read as corner quotes where appropriate. For a similar metalinguistic
version, compare Scheffler and Chomsky (1958: 79&ndash;81). Azzouni
(2004: 50) explicitly takes Quine's criterion to be the metalinguistic
version. Note that treating the metalinguistic criterion as a schema
requires that all object language predicates are included in the
metalanguage. If this is not the case, the criterion can be made
explicitly linguistic by understanding &ldquo;ontologically committed
to <em>K</em>s&rdquo; as &ldquo;ontologically committed to
&lsquo;<em>K</em>&rsquo;&rdquo;. Quine often took this tack of making
problematic relations explicitly linguistic, for example, in the case
of propositional attitudes; see Quine (1960: 211&ndash;216).
Alternatively, one can say: <em>T</em> is <em>ontologically
committed</em> to <em>K</em>s iff <em>T</em> logically entails
&lsquo;&exist;<em>x</em> <em>Px</em>&rsquo; <em>for some
predicate</em> &lsquo;<em>P</em>&rsquo; <em>that expresses the
kind <em>K</em>. </em> See Rayo (2007: 432), where something similar is
called the &ldquo;logical version&rdquo; of Quine's criterion.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>  For an early, more
general objection of the following sort, see Searle (1969:
109&ndash;110).  Searle's argument, however, needs amending, as is done
by Michael (2008: 48&ndash;50).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>  A narrower notion of
explicit commitment would require that the existential sentence be a
member of the theory, not just logically entailed by the theory.  See
Michael (2008: 46&ndash;7) and Peacock (2011: 87). But since theories
can be taken (and often are taken) to be closed under logical
entailment, this narrower notion has little independent interest.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>  Quine, however,
appears to accept implicit ontological commitment in this second
sense.  See, e.g., Quine (1951b: 67).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>  This criterion is
explicitly endorsed by Devitt (1980), Jackson (1989), and Peacock
(2011).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>  Modal
realism&mdash;sometimes called &ldquo;concretism&rdquo;&mdash;is
presented and defended in Lewis 1986. Versions of ersatz modal
realism&mdash;less contentiously called
&ldquo;abstractionism&rdquo;&mdash;have been defended by Plantinga
(1974), Adams (1974), and Stalnaker (1976). Armstrong's
combinatorialism (1989) can be interpreted as an ersatzist account of
worlds, though he prefers a fictionalist interpretation. For an
overview, see Menzel (2013).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>  Compare what Rayo
(2007: 432) calls &ldquo;the metaphysical version of Quine's
criterion&rdquo;: a theory <em>T</em> is ontologically committed
to <em>K</em>s iff, for every world <em>w</em>, <em>T</em> is true
at <em>w</em> only if <em>K</em>s &ldquo;are counted amongst the
values of the variables&rdquo;. Rayo appears in application to treat
this as equivalent to the Modal Quantifier Criterion. But if the
&lsquo;only if&rsquo; is taken to be a material conditional, it is
equivalent instead to a weaker modal entailment account: if numbers
are in the domain of every world, then when &lsquo;&exist;<em>x</em>
Unicorn(<em>x</em>)&rsquo; is evaluated with respect to any world,
numbers &ldquo;are counted amongst the values of the
variables&rdquo;. The problem of irrelevant necessary existents has
not been solved.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>  Switching from
metaphysical to <em>a priori</em> entailment is defended in Michael
(2008); see &sect;2.3 below.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>  For a survey of
relevant entailment relations, and a semantic treatment using
impossible worlds, see Priest (2001).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>  Peacock (2011) defends
modal entailment by invoking a distinction between explicit and
implicit ontological commitment; see &sect;2.2 below.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>  The empty domain
objection to Quine's account is from Church (1958). Quine discusses
quantification and the empty domain, and coins the phrase
&lsquo;inclusive logic&rsquo;, in Quine (1966). For an overview of free
logic and inclusive logic, see Bencivenga (1986).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>  Gottlieb (1974) argues
that the possibility of substitutional quantification shows that
Quine's criterion fails, at least for ordinary language.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a>  Meinongianism comes in
different flavors. A more radical Meinongian, including Meinong
himself, would assert not only that &ldquo;some things do not
exist&rdquo; but also that &ldquo;some things are such that there are
no such things&rdquo;. Routley (1982), McGinn (2000), and Priest (2005) have defended
versions of Meinongianism. </p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>  Qualification. In some
cases of ontological reduction of <em>K</em>s to <em>K*</em>s, we
withhold application of the predicate &lsquo;<em>K</em>&rsquo; to
the <em>K*</em>s because not enough of what we ordinarily take to be
true of the <em>K</em>s is preserved by the reduction. In that case,
we might choose to say that the ontological reduction eliminates
ontological commitment to <em>K</em>s. But this distinction between
reductions that are and are not eliminative is essentially semantic;
it relates to how we describe the ontology, not to the ontology
itself. For discussion, see Hylton (2007: 245&ndash;50).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>  See especially Fine
(2001, 2009). Cameron (2008) also holds that ontological commitment,
if it is to play a role in the ontological enterprise, should be
restricted to fundamental kinds. This leads him to endorse a
truthmaker account of ontological commitment.  Truthmaker accounts are
discussed in &sect;3 below.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>  Armstrong (1980: 443)
writes: Quine gives to predicates
</p><blockquote><p> what has been said to be the privilege of the
harlot: power without responsibility.  The predicate is informative,
it makes a vital contribution to telling us what is the case, the
world is different if it is different, yet ontologically it is
supposed not to commit us. Nice work: if you can get it.
</p></blockquote><p> Lewis (1983: 354) quotes this, and turns it back
on Armstrong who allows that <em>one</em> predicate does not carry
ontological commitment: the predicate of instantiation.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a> Rayo and Yablo (2001)
argue that <em>polyadic</em> second-order quantifiers can be
interpreted in an ontologically innocent way using
&ldquo;non-nominal&rdquo; quantifiers such as
&lsquo;somehow&rsquo;. See also Prior (1971: ch. 3) for an early
discussion of non-nominal quantifiers and ontological commitment.</p>


<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a>  Boolos (1984:
449) writes:
</p><blockquote><p> neither the use of plurals nor the employment of
second-order logic commits us to the existence of extra items beyond
those to which we are already committed.
</p></blockquote><p> Arguments for the ontological innocence of plural
 quantification can be found in Lewis
 (1991: 65&ndash;9). Arguments
 against can be found in Resnik (1988) and Hazen (1993). See Linnebo
 (2013) for discussion.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a>  There will also be a
modal entailment criterion for commitment to particulars: A
theory <em>T</em> is <em>ontologically committed</em> to <em>a</em>
iff <em>T</em> necessarily implies that <em>a</em> exists iff, for
every (metaphysically) possible world <em>w</em>, <em>T</em> is true
at <em>w</em> only if <em>a</em> is in the domain of <em>w</em>.  Note
that, whereas in the criterion for commitment to kinds the necessity
is <em>de dicto</em> (with respect to &lsquo;<em>K</em>&rsquo;), in
the criterion for commitment to particulars, the necessity is <em>de
re</em>.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a>  For an account of
counterfactuals with impossible antecedents that invokes impossible
worlds, see Nolan (1997). For criticism of counterfactual accounts of
ontological commitment, see Brogaard (2008: 30&ndash;1).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a>  Whether
&ldquo;conceptually possible worlds&rdquo; should be taken to be
distinct from metaphysically possible worlds, or instead identified
with metaphysically possible worlds (or centered worlds) but with a
distinct notion of &ldquo;truth at a world&rdquo; (&agrave; la
two-dimensional semantics), is here left wide open. For some
background and discussion, see Jackson (1998: ch. 3) and Chalmers
(2006).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a>  A truthmaker account
of ontological commitment is suggested by Armstrong (2004: 23):
&ldquo;To postulate certain truthmakers for certain truths is to admit
those truthmakers to one's ontology.&rdquo; A truthmaker account is
developed and endorsed by Cameron (2008), rejected by Schaffer (2008),
and further developed and defended by Cameron (2010). See also Heil
(2003: 9) and Melia (2005: 72&ndash;8).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-29" name="29">29.</a>  Lewis (2001) applies
the truthmaker relation directly to non-linguistic propositions.
Armstrong (2004: 12&ndash;6) takes the bearers of truth and
ontological commitment to be intentional objects understood as
properties instantiated, or only possibly instantiated, by concrete
belief tokens; but it is unclear how this is to be squared with his
naturalist convictions. </p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-30" name="30">30.</a>  For a more complete
overview of accounts of truthmaking, see McBride (2013: &sect;1).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-31" name="31">31.</a>  Truthmaker
necessitarianism is the dominant view among truthmaker theorists.
Armstrong (1997: 115&ndash;6) presents an argument for the view; see
also Bigelow (1988: 126). Cameron (forthcoming) criticizes Armstrong's
argument, but defends truthmaker necessitarianism from objections in
Mellor (2003) and Heil (2003: 63).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a>  This terminology will
be adhered to from now on (roughly following Cameron (2010), who
speaks of &ldquo;real being&rdquo;; for discussion of this and related
notions, see Fine (2001)). A fuller account would need to make clear how
this distinction relates to other distinctions that have been taken to
have similar consequences for tallying ontological commitments such as
the more familiar distinction between fundamental entities and derived
entities, or the Meinongian distinction between entities that exist
and entities that don't exist. </p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-33" name="33">33.</a>  See Schaffer (2009)
for an account of the ontological enterprise that focuses on the
question&mdash;what kinds of entity are fundamental?&mdash;rather
than&mdash;what kinds of entity exist?&mdash;an account he traces to
Aristotle. Fine (1991) and Fine (2001) were especially influential in
promoting a neo-Aristotelian account of ontology.</p>


<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-34" name="34">34.</a>  It cannot overgenerate
relative to the modal entailment account (&sect;2.2), since it is a
strengthening of that account. But it can overgenerate relative to
an <em>a priori</em> entailment account (&sect;2.3), since,
presumably, it may not be <em>a priori</em> knowable what the
truthmakers of a theory are.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-35" name="35">35.</a>  Note that a
mereological nihilist does not escape the problem by holding that all
commitment is to simples. The missing implicit commitments are just
re-characterized as simples-arranged-trunkwise, or
simples-arranged-malewise. The same problematic patterns of necessity
and sufficiency hold at the level of simples.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-36" name="36">36.</a>  If the entailment
relation in question is an appropriately <em>relevant</em> relation,
then, plausibly, <em>T</em> entails that <em>a</em>, or
some <em>K</em>s, really exist just in case <em>a</em>, or
some <em>K</em>s, are <em>partial</em> truthmakers for <em>T</em>. In
that case, the above criteria can be seen as substituting <em>partial
truthmaking</em> for <em>truthmaking</em> as a condition of
ontological commitment.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-37" name="37">37.</a>  For example, Quine
writes:
</p><blockquote><p> Ordinary language is only loosely referential, and
any ontological accounting makes sense only relative to an appropriate
regimentation of language. The regimentation is not a matter of
eliciting some latent but determinate content of ordinary language. It
is a matter rather of freely creating an ontology-oriented language
that can supplant ordinary language in serving some particular
purposes that one has in mind. (Quine 1977: 168)</p></blockquote>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-38" name="38">38.</a>  That objectual
quantifiers must be ontologically committing can and has been
denied. For example, Azzouni (2004: 55) holds that the view that
objectual quantifiers are ontologically committing because they have a
Tarskian domain semantics just presupposes that the metalinguistic
quantifiers in terms of which the Tarskian semantics is given
themselves are ontologically committing.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-39" name="39">39.</a>  This portion of
ordinary language will have to undergo some regimentation if it is to
have the full expressive power of first-order logic: there will need
to be indefinitely many pronouns to serve as bound variables and
sufficient punctuation to disambiguate structure. But these resources,
arguably, already belong to ordinary language, however stilted the
resulting sentences. On the relation between first-order logic and
ordinary language, see Van Inwagen (1998).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-40" name="40">40.</a>  Schaffer (2009) is
content to let the question&mdash;what exists?&mdash;be easy to
answer. The hard question, which forms the heart of metaphysical
inquiry, is: what grounds what?</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-41" name="41">41.</a>  Widely accepted
examples of ontological reduction come from mathematics, such as the
reduction of numbers, or ordered pairs, to sets. Indeed, Quine
significantly calls the latter &ldquo;a philosophical paradigm&rdquo;
(Quine 1960).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-42" name="42">42.</a>  Van Inwagen, after
giving a detailed account of Quine's method of paraphrase, concludes:
</p><blockquote><p> All ontological disputes in which the disputants
do not accept Quine's strategy of ontological clarification are
suspect. If Quine's rules for conducting an ontological dispute are
not followed&mdash;so say those of us who are adherents of Quine's
meta-ontology&mdash;it is almost certain that many untoward
consequences of the disputed positions will be obscured by imprecision
and wishful thinking. (Van Inwagen 1998: 31)</p></blockquote>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-43" name="43">43.</a>  Should we trust her
answer? An alternative method is to engage in an interpretative
project, asking how we might best understand her theory. See Lewis
(1990) and &sect;1.6.3 above.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-44" name="44">44.</a>  Yablo (1999), though
no defender of the method of paraphrase, sees paraphrase in a somewhat
different light: it is not that the original is indeterminate and
needs to be replaced by something more precise, but that the original
is metaphorical and needs to be replaced by something that expresses
its literal content.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-45" name="45">45.</a>  Whether an appropriate
notion of &ldquo;having the same truth conditions&rdquo; can be worked
out is controversial. See Hale (1996) for an attempt to do so; Potter
and Smiley (2001) for critical discussion.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-46" name="46">46.</a>  Why must these
commitments to objects&mdash;whether directions or numbers&mdash;be
commitments to <em>abstract</em> objects?  See Rosen (1993: 168ff) for
discussion.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-47" name="47">47.</a>  Other views that, in
virtue of their liberal criteria of ontological commitment, have
affinities with the neo-Fregean account include <em>full-blooded
Platonism</em>, a.k.a. <em>maximalism</em> (Balaguer 1998; Eklund
2006), <em>pleonasticism</em> (Schiffer 2003), and <em>easy
ontology</em> (Thomasson 2008).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-48" name="48">48.</a> Carnap (1956:
42&ndash;3) writes:</p>

<blockquote><p> I am essentially in agreement with [Quine's]
view&hellip;. But, first, I wish to indicate a doubt concerning
Quine's <em>formulation</em> &hellip; I would prefer not to use the
word &lsquo;<em>ontology</em>&rsquo; for the recognition of entities
by the admission of variables. This use seems to me to be at least
misleading; it might be understood as implying that the decision to
use certain kinds of variable must be based on ontological,
metaphysical convictions.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Notes to the Supplement</h3>

<p>

<a href="supplement.html#supp-note-1" name="supp-note-1">1.</a>  Counterpart
theory was first presented in Lewis (1968). For an extended defense of
the inconstancy of <em>de re</em> modality, see Lewis (1986:
248&ndash;63).</p>

<p>

<a href="supplement.html#supp-note-2" name="supp-note-2">2.</a>  For this account
of truthmaking for predications, see Lewis (2003). Lewis
uses <em>qua</em>-names, such as &lsquo;Socrates <em>qua</em>
wise&rsquo;, to create contexts in which Socrates is essentially
wise. For discussion and critique, see Bricker (2014).</p>

<p>

<a href="supplement.html#supp-note-3" name="supp-note-3">3.</a>  Armstrong
apparently would not endorse this response; his central argument for
states of affairs as truthmakers (Armstrong 1997: 115) requires that
&lsquo;<em>a</em>&rsquo; refer to the thin particular in
&lsquo;<em>a</em> is <em>F</em>&rsquo;. </p>

<p>

<a href="supplement.html#supp-note-4" name="supp-note-4">4.</a>  For an account of
truthmaking that favors tropes over states of affairs, see Mulligan,
Simons, and Smith (1984). </p>

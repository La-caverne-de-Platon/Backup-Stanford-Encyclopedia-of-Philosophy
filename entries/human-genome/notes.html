<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">The Human Genome Project</a></h2>


<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>
See, for
example, Davis and colleagues (1990). Watson later characterized the
backlash as behavior more suited to postal workers&rsquo; unions than
scientific groups (1992, p. 165).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>
This was
followed by a combined $39 million in FY 1989, $88 million in FY 1990,
and $135 million in FY1991. For ensuing years, see the
 <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/budget.shtml" target="other">Human Genome Project Budget</a>.</p>


<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>
Besides Wexler
as chair, the initial members of the Joint Working Group were Victor
McKusick, Jonathan R. Beckwith, Robert Murray, Patricia King, and
Thomas H. Murray.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>
Combining the
enzyme reverse transcriptase with messenger RNA (mRNA) isolated from
the body&rsquo;s cells yields complementary DNA (cDNA); these cDNAs are
stored as bacterial inserts to provide researchers with a
&ldquo;library&rdquo; of clones for genes known to be active in the
brain, liver, etc. Just as Sydney Brenner had proposed in discussions
leading up to the HGP, Venter saw mapping sequenced cDNAs to the genome
as a cheaper, quicker, and more useful approach than mapping and
sequencing the entire genome which includes so-called junk as well as
transcribed regions.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>
In early 1992,
after a second Venter publication (Adams et al. 1992) and NIH bundle of
patent applications, the U.K.&rsquo;s Medical Research Council applied
to the U.S. Patent Office for patents on ESTs from Brenner&rsquo;s
unpublished work. Healy appealed the ensuing rejection received from
the USPTO, but her successor Harold Varmus withdrew the applications in
early 1994 (Davies 2002).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>
Wallace
Steinberg financed two companies: Venter&rsquo;s nonprofit research
center, The Institute for Genome Research (TIGR), set out to produce as
many ESTs as possible; Human Genome Services (HGS) was set up to market
TIGR&rsquo;s discoveries&mdash;CEO William Haseltine began by selling
seven percent of HGS and exclusive commercial rights to TIGR&rsquo;s
genes to SmithKline-Beecham for $125 million in May 1993 (Davies 2002,
pp. 64-66).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
In 1991, funds
of about 2000 yen ($14 million) were divided between three agencies:
the Science and Technology Agency funded the development of automated
sequencing and mapping and sequencing of chromosome 21 at its Institute
of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN); the Ministry of Education,
Science, and Culture funded a grants-based program and a new genome
center at Tokyo University; and the Ministry of Health and Welfare
funded the sequencing of disease genes (Swinbanks 1991). In 1994,
Kazusa DNA Research Institute opened with support from industry and the
local government of the Chiba region (Swinbanks 1994), and in 1995, the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry opened a sequencing center
in Tokyo (Swinbanks 1995).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>
A full account
of international efforts cannot be provided here. Italy&rsquo;s genome
project began as a pilot project in 1987 under the leadership of
Dulbecco. Russia&rsquo;s genome project began in 1988 in the old
U.S.S.R. Canada began a four-year genome program in 1992 with funding
by government agencies and the National Cancer Institute, but funding
was not renewed (Kaiser 1997); in 2000, however, the federal government
created Genome Canada, a nonprofit organization to support large-scale
genomics and proteomics projects. The Human Genome Organization (HUGO)
formed in 1988 with private funding (from Howard Hughes Medical
Institute in the U.S. and the Wellcome Trust in the U.K.) to help
coordinate these efforts, particularly regarding communication and data
exchange across international boundaries.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>
WGS
approaches to the human genome were proposed (Weber and Myers 1997;
Venter et al. 1997), but rejected as flawed (Green 1997).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>
Hamilton
Smith, who had joined TIGR&rsquo;s scientific advisory board at
Venter&rsquo;s invitation, proposed at a staff meeting in late 1993
that TIGR sequence the complete genome of a bacterium using the WGS
method. This took 13 months at a cost of $.48 per base and a total cost
of $1 million (Davies 2002, pp. 104-108).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>
In 2002,
this controversy was aired in the pages of <em>PNAS</em> (see Waterston
et al. 2002, Green 2002, and Myers et al. 2002).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>
However, the
completion of the HGP and the production of the &ldquo;finished&rdquo;
sequence do not mean that the complete human genome has been sequenced.
The heterochromatic gene-poor regions that make up about 10 percent of
the genome (0.2 of 3.1 billion base pairs) are too difficult to
sequence with present-day technologies because of the highly repetitive
stretches of DNA they contain. These regions are located especially at
the tips and centromeres of the chromosomes. The euchromatic gene-rich
regions of the genome (2.9 of 3.1 billion base pairs) are 99 percent
completed. About 400 gaps remain with average fragment sizes of more
than 27 million bases; these gaps are due to difficulties with their
amplification for sequencing, perhaps because of unusual shape or
toxicity to the bacteria used. An accuracy rate of 99.99 percent has
been achieved. While it might take another 10 to 20 years to have every
base in place, the &ldquo;finished&rdquo; sequence is a vast
improvement over the &ldquo;working draft&rdquo; version that contained
some 150,000 gaps, average fragment sizes of 81,900 bases, and an
accuracy rate of 99.9 percent (Anonymous 2003; Wade 2003).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>
Several
decades ago, attempts to reduce classical to molecular genetics
foundered on difficulties finding bridge principles to define classical
genes in terms of molecular genes (Hull 1974); more recently, it is
argued that, since evolutionary genes are implicated in any heritable
phenotypic difference, unlike molecular genes, these need not be
restricted to specific stretches of DNA (Griffiths and Neumann-Held
1999).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>
An
interesting empirical investigation of scientists&rsquo; use of gene
concepts found that, in their work, molecular and evolutionary
biologists favored Gene-P and developmental biologists favored Gene-D,
but when asked explicitly, all biologists preferred a molecular
definition of the gene (Stotz, Griffiths, and Knight 2004).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>
This recalls
Kitcher (1992): &ldquo;A gene is anything a competent biologist chooses
to call a gene&rdquo; (p. 131).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>
These claims
by evolutionist critics of the HGP are examined at length in Gannett
(2003a).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>
More
recently, Parens (2004), writing about behavioral genetics and noting
that awareness of physical differences has always existed alongside
beliefs in moral equality, acknowledges &ldquo;the old and perhaps
permanent danger that inquiries into the genetic differences among us
will be appropriated to justify inequalities in the distribution of
social power&rdquo; (p. S31), but argues that behavioral genetics also
has the potential to affirm the value of diversity insofar as it takes
an individual-differences rather than a species-typicality perspective
to genetic variation. This article is based on Parens&rsquo;
experiences as part of an NHGRI ELSI-funded initiative undertaken by
The Hastings Center and the American Association for the Advancement of
Science called &ldquo;Crafting Tools for Public Conversation about
Behavioral Genetics&rdquo;&mdash;see
 <a href="http://www.aaas.org/spp/bgenes/" target="other">http://www.aaas.org/spp/bgenes/</a>.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>
The HapMap website, http://www.hapmap.org/index.html.en, was 
shutdown, though there are two pages at the NIH website
related to it: the first is a 
 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1310647/" target="other">description</a>
of the website and the second is a 
 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/news/NCBI_retiring_HapMap/" target="other">notice</a>
 that the page is being retired. See also the website
 <a href="https://www.internationalgenome.org/" target="other">IGSR and the 1000 Genomes Project</a>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a>
Developmental biologist Lewis Wolpert (1994) makes a claim similar to
Gilbert&rsquo;s, a claim which has come in for philosophical debate,
with support from Rosenberg (1997) and opposition from Keller (1999)
and Robert (2004).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>
We are
perhaps disinclined to embrace this, especially when it comes to the
prospect of crossing species boundaries, which although not fixed in
biological fact may exist nonetheless for us as &ldquo;moral
constructs&rdquo; (Robert and Baylis 2003).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>
De
Melo-Mart&iacute;n (2005, ch. 1) points out that, even if genetic
determinism were true, we are not freed from our responsibility to
reform social institutions and practices&mdash;and, by doing so, what
makes a certain behavior a social problem in the first place may also
change.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>
HGP
proponents sought support for the project by emphasizing the importance
of genes in determining behavioral as well as physical traits:
<em>Science</em> editor Daniel Koshland (1989) submitted that genes are
responsible not only for manic-depression and schizophrenia but also
poverty and homelessness, and that sequencing the genome represented
&ldquo;a great new technology to aid the poor, the infirm, and the
underprivileged&rdquo; (p. 189).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a>
See
 <a href="http://www.genome.gov/11006929/" target="other">http://www.genome.gov/11006929/</a>.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a>
It is
pointed out how removing phenylalanine from the diet compensates for
the genetic defect associated with the disease so what may appear to be
genetically determined is not. Kaplan goes on to provide an account of
just how misleading this standard story of PKU is (2000, pp. 13-21);
see also Paul (1995).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a>
In contrast,
other authors (Griffiths 2006; Lewontin 1993; Rosoff and Rosenberg
2006) take an approach that limits genetic determinism to being a
thesis about the causation of socially important traits. Rosoff and
Rosenberg (2006) distinguish genocentrism which they take to be true
(the genes play a special role in development whereby they literally
program the embryo and regulate cellular processes once development is
complete) and genetic determinism which they take to be
false.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a>
Lewontin
(2000 [1992]) notes an industrial-age counterpart: &ldquo;the transfer
onto biology of the belief in the superiority of mental labor over the
merely physical, of the planner and designer over the unskilled
operative on the assembly line&rdquo; (pp. 143-144).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a>
Also see
Sarkar 1998, Sober 2001, and Wahlsten 1990 for discussions of
heritability. These constraints on the legitimacy of drawing
conclusions based on estimates of heritability&mdash;for example, for
social policy&mdash;are often ignored (see discussion in Kaplan 2000,
ch. 3).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a>
While DSTers
implicate scientists&rsquo; asymmetrical treatment of genetic versus
nongenetic causes to explain the persistence of beliefs in genetic
determinism, Keller (1992) argues that the nature-nurture controversy
has cultural and political as well as scientific underpinnings. When
beliefs in genetic determinism and support of eugenics declined after
WWII, geneticists avoided being tarnished by Nazi crimes by
distinguishing knowledge of genetics from its uses, and their study of
nonhuman organisms from the study of human genetics. Outside of
genetics, the postwar optimism of the 1950s-1960s shifted the weight
for determining human behavior from nature to nurture. But by the
late-1960s, the pendulum began to shift again: geneticists had never
relinquished their beliefs in genetic determinism and their hopes for
eventually gaining control over human evolution, and as the status of
genetics increased within biology, and the status of science increased
within society, these views came to predominate. Of course, with the
genetic engineering toolkit that has been assembled over the past few
decades, the nature-nurture controversy is not what it once was. Keller
characterizes this capacity for technological intervention as the
transfiguration of genetic determinism, a reversal of representations
of nature as destiny and nurture as freedom now that nature is
perceived to be easier to control.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-29" name="29">29.</a>
For a debate
over the merits of the geneticization thesis, and its comparison to the
earlier medicalization thesis, see ten Have (2001) and Hedgecoe
(2001).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-30" name="30">30.</a>
See Proctor
(1992) for discussion of cancer as a genetic disease.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-31" name="31">31.</a>
On this
basis, Gifford (1990) distinguishes two senses of
&ldquo;genetic&rdquo;: (i) &ldquo;A trait is genetic (with respect to
population <em>P</em>) if it is genetic factors which &lsquo;make the
difference&rsquo; between those individuals with the trait and the rest
of population <em>P</em>&rdquo; (p. 333)&mdash;this is his
&ldquo;differentiating factor criterion&rdquo;; and (ii) &ldquo;For a
trait to be genetic, the gene (or set of genes) must cause that trait
<em>as described</em>. The trait must be individuated in such a way
that it matches what some genetic factors cause specifically&rdquo; (p.
343)&mdash;this is his &ldquo;proper individuation
criterion.&rdquo;</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a>
Smith (2001)
proposes an epidemiological definition of &ldquo;genetic disease&rdquo;
which recognizes this population-based context-dependence: a genetic
disease is one in which &ldquo;those with the gene are more likely than
not to develop the disease,&rdquo; and &ldquo;most cases of disease in
the population are caused by the gene&rdquo; (p. 23).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-33" name="33">33.</a>
A pragmatic
account of explanation in developmental biology that examines ways in
which environmental causes are overlooked in favor of genetic ones is
provided by van der Weele (1999).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-35" name="35">35.</a>
These were
topics of discussion at the 1997 seminar &ldquo;Making Choices:
Organisms in the History of Biology&rdquo; sponsored by the Dibner
Institute for the History of Science and Technology and held at the
Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA.</p>

Wimsatt
(1998) argues that generative entrenchment favors the ability of a
simple system to model a more complex one insofar as features with
significant downstream consequences in development are likely to be
conserved in evolution.</p>

The
Harvard-Dupont oncomouse provided the basis for challenging patent laws
outside the U.S. In 1997, the EU decided to allow the patenting of
higher life forms, but imposed ethical restrictions (e.g. any
modification causing suffering or physical handicap to animals without
medical benefits could not be patented). This reflects the exclusion
clause (Art 53[a]) in the European Patent Convention for inventions
contrary to morality. In 2002, a 5-4 decision by Canada&rsquo;s Supreme
Court in <em>Harvard College v Canada (Commissioner of Patents)</em>
upheld existing law which permitted the patenting of genetically
altered cells (including human ones) and simple organisms like bacteria
and yeast but prohibited the patenting of higher life forms, including
plants, seeds, and animals.</p>

The EC
Directive on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions,
though adopted by the European Parliament in July 1998, has not yet
been ratified by all member states. Article 5 of the directive
distinguishes gene sequences and partial sequences as an element of the
human body from elements &ldquo;isolated from the human body or
otherwise produced by means of a technical process&rdquo; with only the
latter patentable (Reed 2006, pp. 58-59). For more on the Directive,
and an international comparison of positions on gene patents, see
Knoppers (1999).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-39" name="39">39.</a>
Eisenberg
(2002) argues that, though the chemical analogy worked well for
1980s-era genetically engineered proteins given a patent system
designed &ldquo;to serve the needs of a bricks-and-mortar world&rdquo;
(p. 10), it is not equipped to handle today&rsquo;s applications which
seek patent protection for DNA sequence <em>information</em> and not
the molecules themselves. Sagoff (2002) challenges Eisenberg&rsquo;s
analysis; according to Sagoff, when an invention is patented, the
patentee gains rights to the knowledge embodied in the object, whether
that object is a Gillette safety razor or a gene, and hence, molecules
and information cannot be separated in the way Eisenberg suggests.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-41" name="41">41.</a>
Article 5 of
the EC Directive requires patent applications to disclose the
&ldquo;industrial application&rdquo; of gene sequences or partial
sequences (in Reed, p. 59).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-42" name="42">42.</a>
Reed (2006)
uses philosopher Hugo Grotius as a &ldquo;dialogue partner&rdquo; to
explore taking an approach to gene patenting that bears in mind the
&ldquo;common good&rdquo;; she finds Grotius helpful in this regard as
a figure transitional in the historical movement to liberal conceptions
of individual rights and private property associated with Hobbes and
Locke.</p>

The combined
use of prenatal testing and selective abortion precedes the HGP by
several decades. In the mid-1950s, some research hospitals used
amniocentesis to detect fetal sex through the presence/absence of the
Barr body for couples with a family history of sex-linked conditions
like hemophilia. Uses for amniocentesis expanded: by the late-1960s,
fetal karyotyping could be carried out to detect chromosomal
abnormalities associated with conditions like Down syndrome; by the
early-1970s, neural tube defects like spina bifida could be diagnosed.
The legalization of abortion (by a 1967 Act of Parliament in the U.K.
and the 1973 Supreme Court decision in <em>Roe v Wade</em> in the U.S.)
permitted amniocentesis to become widely available in the 1970s.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-44" name="44">44.</a> More than 1000 tests
are now available on a clinical or research basis. See
 <a href="http://www.bcm.edu/geneticlabs/tests.cfm" target="other">http://www.bcm.edu/geneticlabs/tests.cfm</a>,
for a list of prenatal tests that can be requisitioned at Baylor
College of Medicine. For a list of conditions for which Genesis
Genetics Institute has performed PGD, see

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-45" name="45">45.</a>
In 1997,
based on the results of pilot screening programs, a NIH Consensus
Statement recommended that testing be offered to families with a
positive disease history and couples currently planning a pregnancy or
seeking prenatal testing, but not to the general adult population or
newborns. See

It is worth
quoting Callahan at length: &ldquo;The right to procreate, as a claimed
human right, is primarily of post-World War II vintage. It took hold
first in the United States with the acceptance of artificial
insemination (AID) and was strengthened by a series of court decisions
upholding contraception and abortion. The emergence of in vitro
fertilization in 1978, widespread surrogate motherhood in the 1980s,
and a continuous stream of other technological developments over the
past three decades have provided a wide range of techniques to pursue
reproductive choice. It is not clear what, if any, limits remain any
longer to an exercise of those rights. Consider the progression of a
claimed right: from a right to have or not have children as one
chooses, to a right to have them any way one can, and then to have the
kind of child one wants&rdquo; (1998, p. 142).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-47" name="47">47.</a>
Historians
differ in the extent to which they emphasize continuities and
discontinuities in drawing lessons for today from past eugenics. See
Allen (1994), Kevles (1994), Paul (1994a), and Proctor (1992).
</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-48" name="48">48.</a>
See Gannett
(1997), Paul (2000), and Radick (2001) for criticisms.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-49" name="49">49.</a>
Kahn and
Mastroianni (2004) note, however, that the argument that a child born
as a result of prenatal testing must have been benefited in virtue of
being born at all can be used to justify the ethical permissibility of
selecting for or against <em>any</em> trait. Gavaghan (2000) provides a
similar argument in defense of Nozick&rsquo;s idea of a &ldquo;genetic
supermarket.&rdquo;</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-50" name="50">50.</a>
Based on
their study of women tested/not tested for the BRCA1 gene, Zick et al.
(2000) argue that these fears may be exaggerated in the case of life
insurance. </p>

GINA
strengthens already-existing legislation at the state and federal
levels (K. Hudson et al. 1995; Rothenberg et al. 1997). Most states
have genetic nondiscrimination and privacy laws which prevent the use
of genetic information for medical underwriting. The Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 prohibited the use
of genetic information for determining eligibility for group health
plans, including the self-funded insurance plans of employers which the
Employment Retirement and Income Security Act (ERISA) had exempted from
state laws. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) ruled in
1995 that a positive test for a disease-linked gene counts as a
disability protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of
1990; however, the act did not prevent employers from limiting health
care coverage or eliminating benefits altogether, and the onus for
enforcement rested on the employee&rsquo;s willingness to sue.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-53" name="53">53.</a>
Watson and
Venter are now promoting the idea that there is nothing to fear by
making one&rsquo;s sequence public rather than protecting it as
private. As mentioned in section 2.1.2, 71 percent of the Celera
sequence was Venter&rsquo;s. Venter&rsquo;s genome was subsequently
fully sequenced and the findings published in the October 2007 issue of
<em>PLoS Biology</em> (Levy et al. 2007); this was followed by the
publication of Watson&rsquo;s genome in the 17 April 2008 issue of
<em>Nature</em> (Wheeler et al. 2008). Relevant to the privacy
question, Watson did not bare all: at Watson&rsquo;s request, the APOE
gene which is linked to Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease was omitted from his
sequence. Along similar lines, Harvard medical geneticist George M.
Church is spearheading the Personal Genome Project (PGP) (see
 <a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/" target="other">http://www.personalgenomes.org/</a>).
Ten volunteers have already agreed to release their genomes and health
and physical information publicly, and a total of 100,000 volunteers
are being sought. Says Church: &ldquo;Ideally, everybody on the planet
would share their medical and genomic information&rdquo; (in Dizikes
2007). </p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-54" name="54">54.</a>
Such debates
unfolded differently in the U.K. where genetic risk was seen as similar
to other forms of risk underwritten by insurers with the need to
balance the right of the individual to privacy against the right of
insurers to adequate information. In 1999, the British government
created the Genetics and Insurance Committee (GAIC) as an advisory
board to decide whether genetic tests, reviewed on an individual basis,
should be incorporated in insurance underwriting (Parthasarathy
2004).</p>

Scully
(2001) questions why the technical distinction between somatic cell and
germ-line GM and the intentional distinction between therapy and
enhancement should be expected to coincide with moral boundaries. She
criticizes the tendency of bioethicists to draw lines between morally
permissible and impermissible acts in this way, and recommends instead
a &ldquo;reverse ethics&rdquo; approach which focuses on the contextual
factors that lead specific groups to place boundaries where they
do.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-58" name="58">58.</a>
Buchanan et
al. (2000, pp. 150-151) downplay the metaphysical importance of the
species adaptive norm as an objective basis for distinguishing between
health and disease (hence, therapy and enhancement, and enhancement for
health vs. social purposes), but argue that any valuations present are
likely to be widely shared, and in this sense objective.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-59" name="59">59.</a>
It bears
pointing out, however, that ooplasmic transfer with IVF has resulted in
children being born with three biological parents insofar as mtDNA from
the donor cytoplasm is inherited (Rasko et al. 2006).</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-60" name="60">60.</a>
Loftis
(2005) challenges this relative complacency toward nonhumans and its
contrast to the caution exhibited toward humans.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-61" name="61">61.</a>
Buchanan et
al. (2000) proceed to redefine the no-longer-static boundary between
the social and natural in terms of &ldquo;what is subject to human
control and what is not&rdquo; (p. 83), the former properly regarded as
a matter of justice/injustice and the latter as a matter of
fortune/misfortune. </p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-62" name="62">62.</a>
Wenz (2005)
argues that Buchanan et al. confuse just societies and real societies,
and that insofar as the U.S. departs from the &ldquo;just and humane
society&rdquo; envisioned by Rawls (in its educational spending, lack
of universal health care, etc.), genetic interventions are not likely
to be instituted in a just way, whether these involve
&ldquo;health-related&rdquo; or &ldquo;desire-related&rdquo;
enhancements.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-63" name="63">63.</a>
Lindsay
(2005) points out, however, that what justice forbids as a competitive
advantage (e.g. intellectual or musical abilities) could be undertaken
for wholly intrinsic reasons of self-improvement.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-64" name="64">64.</a>
Lindsay
(2005) argues that, because genetic technologies will transform us,
society, and basic ideas about justice (e.g. on Rawls&rsquo; account,
who counts as &ldquo;least advantaged&rdquo; and what counts as
&ldquo;sufficient resources&rdquo; and &ldquo;equal
opportunity&rdquo;), we are ill-equipped at present to decide on the
permissibility of specific genetic interventions on the basis of
justice.</p>

<h3><a name="1">1. Medieval Philosophy</a></h3>

<p>

In the supplementary document on 
 <a href="s2.html">Ancient Conceptions of Analysis</a>,
 three particular sources of conceptions of analysis were 
identified&mdash;ancient Greek geometry, Plato&rsquo;s dialogues and 
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Analytics</em>. The interconnections between 
these alone are complex; but there were other influential conceptions
in antiquity as well&mdash;most notably, Galen&rsquo;s amalgam of 
previous methodologies in the context of medicine, and the 
Neoplatonists&rsquo; theological transformation of Plato&rsquo;s 
method of division. Given this complexity, and the fragmentary nature
of the material upon which writers in the medieval period drew, it is
not surprising that making sense of medieval methodologies is an 
interpretive nightmare.</p>

<p>

The interpretive intricacies can be illustrated here by taking the 
case of Thomas Aquinas (c.1225-74). In a recent paper (1994), Eileen 
Sweeney has argued that there are three notions of 
<em>resolutio</em>&mdash;to use the Latin term that translated the 
original Greek word &lsquo;<em>analusis</em>&rsquo;&mdash;in 
Aquinas&rsquo;s work. The first is resolution as a kind of 
<em>division</em>, understood as a process of decomposition, modelled
on the movement <em>down</em> a classificatory tree in Plato&rsquo;s 
method of division, whereby a genus is &lsquo;broken down&rsquo; into
its constituent species. The second is resolution as 
<em>reversion</em> (i.e., regression), in effect understood in 
opposition to the first, since it is modelled on the movement 
<em>up</em> a classificatory tree towards the higher Forms. (For more
on the connection between these two conceptions, see 
 <a href="index-2.html#4">&sect;4</a>
 of the main document.) The third is resolution as 
<em>problem-solving</em>, understood as what is prior to the 
systematic act of demonstration (synthesis). The first derives from 
Plato, and more specifically, Sweeney suggests, Calcidius&rsquo;s 
<em>Commentary on the Timaeus</em>, which also owes something to 
Aristotle. The second shows the influence of Neoplatonism, according 
to which all things are to be resolved into their principles and 
ultimately traced back to the One (God). The third (as shown in 
 <a href="index-2.html#AncConc">&sect;2</a>
 of the main document) has its roots in ancient Greek geometry, again 
mediated through the works of Aristotle. If this account is right, 
then it suggests, at the very least, that there are certain tensions 
in Aquinas&rsquo;s discussions of methodology, tensions that reflect 
the different traditions which he was attempting to bring together.</p>

<p>

However, perhaps the richest and most interesting text for exploring 
conceptions of analysis in medieval philosophy is the <em>Summulae de
Dialectica</em> (<em>SD</em>) of John Buridan (c.1300-c.1360). 
Ostensibly a commentary on Peter of Spain&rsquo;s <em>Tractatus</em> 
or <em>Summulae Logicales</em>, it is in fact a systematic compendium
of medieval logic, going considerably beyond Peter&rsquo;s work, and 
amounting to some 1000 pages (in its first complete English 
translation of 2001). Comprising nine Treatises, the key Treatise for
our purposes is the eighth, entitled &lsquo;On Demonstrations&rsquo;.
Buridan here distinguishes between divisions, definitions and 
demonstrations, which can be seen as illustrating the distinction 
drawn in 
 <a href="index-2.html#1">&sect;1</a>
 of the main document between decompositional, interpretive and 
regressive analysis. The bulk of the Treatise (chs. 3-12) is 
concerned with demonstration, explaining and elaborating on 
Aristotle&rsquo;s account in the <em>Posterior Analytics</em> (as 
outlined in the supplement on 
 <a href="s2.html#4">Ancient Conceptions of Analysis, &sect;4</a>).
 Central to this is Aristotle&rsquo;s distinction between 
understanding &lsquo;the fact&rsquo; and understanding &lsquo;the 
reason why&rsquo;&mdash;between demonstration <em>quia</em> and 
demonstration <em>propter quid</em>, in medieval terms (see esp. 
<em>SD</em>, Tr. 8, chs. 8-9). Here the regressive conception of 
analysis is dominant. Buridan talks, for example, of 
&lsquo;simple&rsquo; demonstrations being ones that are not 
&lsquo;analyzable&rsquo; or &lsquo;resolvable&rsquo; into prior 
demonstrations (<em>SD</em>, 8.5.2), and of demonstration 
<em>quia</em> as a &lsquo;reversion&rsquo; from effect to cause 
(<em>SD</em>, 8.9.3). But the discussion of demonstration is prefaced
by two chapters on division and definition, and here Plato&rsquo;s 
influence is more manifest. Buridan characterises 
&lsquo;division&rsquo; as the separation of a whole into its parts 
(<em>SD</em>, 8.1.2), and distinguishes various kinds of division, 
one kind being the division of a genus into its species, which was 
Plato&rsquo;s method of division. His account of definition too has 
its roots in Plato&rsquo;s work, and in particular, the elenctic 
method of Socrates (cf. the supplement on 
 <a href="s2.html#3">Ancient Conceptions of Analysis, &sect;3</a>).
 But it also draws on Aristotle&rsquo;s work, and most significantly 
of all, anticipates the interpretive conception of analysis of 
twentieth-century analytic philosophy.</p>

<p>

Buridan&rsquo;s treatment of definition would not look out of place 
in a modern textbook. He offers a succinct statement of criteria of 
adequacy, and draws a clear distinction between four types of 
definition&mdash;nominal, quidditative (i.e., real), causal and 
descriptive. The interpretive conception of analysis comes out in his
account of nominal definition. Buridan writes that &ldquo;A nominal 
definition [<em>diffinitio explicans quid nominis</em>] is an 
expression convertibly explaining what thing or things the definitum 
[i.e., the term defined] signifies or connotes, and properly speaking
it is called &lsquo;interpretation&rsquo;&rdquo;, adding that 
&ldquo;here I take &lsquo;interpretation&rsquo; for the explicit 
analysis [<em>expositio</em>] of the signification of a word or 
expression that is being interpreted&rdquo;. The term 
&lsquo;philosopher&rsquo;, for example, is interpreted as 
&lsquo;lover of wisdom&rsquo;, and the sentence &lsquo;Only man is 
risible&rsquo; as the conjunction &lsquo;Man is risible, and nothing 
other than man is risible&rsquo;. (<em>SD</em>, 8.2.3; cf. Tr. 6, ch.
3.) Further examples can be found in the ninth and final Treatise, 
entitled &lsquo;Sophismata&rsquo;, although here the term 
&lsquo;interpretation&rsquo; is not itself used. In this Treatise, 
Buridan illustrates how interpretive analysis can be put to work in 
clarifying &lsquo;<em>sophismata</em>&rsquo;&mdash;sentences that are
philosophically puzzling or instructive. He shows, for example, how 
&lsquo;Some donkey every man sees&rsquo; is ambiguous, suggesting the
two formulations &lsquo;Some donkey every man sees&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;Every man sees some donkey&rsquo; to bring out what we would 
now explain in terms of the different scope of the two quantifiers 
&lsquo;some&rsquo; and &lsquo;every&rsquo; (cf. <em>SD</em>, Tr. 9, 
ch. 3, seventh sophism and reply).</p>

<p>

As used here, the quantifiers &lsquo;only&rsquo;, &lsquo;some&rsquo; 
and &lsquo;every&rsquo; are examples of what medieval logicians 
called &lsquo;syncategorematic&rsquo; expressions (or uses of 
expressions)&mdash;expressions that signify nothing by themselves, 
but only when taken together with some other expression (in this 
case, &lsquo;man&rsquo; or &lsquo;donkey&rsquo;). From the twelfth 
century onwards, there was much discussion of the logic of 
syncategoremata, and exposition (<em>expositio</em>), i.e., 
interpretive analysis, became one of the main tools of elucidation. 
From the middle of the fourteenth century, until the demise of 
medieval logic in the sixteenth century, 
<em>exponibilia</em>&mdash;exponible sentences, i.e., sentences 
requiring exposition&mdash;became a subject in itself for systematic 
treatment. Although its authorship is uncertain, the <em>Tractatus 
exponibilium</em> of 1489 is representative of such treatment. An 
exponible sentence is here defined in terms of syncategoremata: 
&ldquo;An exponible proposition [<em>propositio exponibilis</em>] is 
a proposition that has an obscure sense requiring exposition in 
virtue of some syncategorema occurring either explicitly or included 
within some word.&rdquo; (Tr. in Kretzmann 1982, 215.)</p>

<p>

Kretzmann (1982) gives several examples of sophismata involving 
syncategoremata to illustrate the way in which their treatment 
developed in the later medieval period. One example involves the 
exceptive term &lsquo;praeter&rsquo;:</p>

<p>

(S) Socrates twice sees every man except Plato. [<em>Socrates bis 
videt omnem hominem praeter Platonem</em>.]</p>

<p>

This sentence too is ambiguous, depending on the scope of the 
syncategoremata &lsquo;twice&rsquo; and &lsquo;except&rsquo;. The two
interpretations might be represented as follows:</p>

<p>

(S#) With the exception of Plato (Socrates twice sees every man).</p>

<p>

(S*) Twice (Socrates sees every man except Plato).</p>

<p>

The difference can be appreciated by considering the case in which, 
on one occasion, Socrates sees everyone including Plato, and on 
another occasion, sees everyone excluding Plato, i.e., where Socrates
sees Plato once and everyone else twice. (S#) would then be true, but
(S*) false. Various diagnoses of the ambiguity can be found in the 
literature on syncategoremata from the twelfth to the sixteenth 
centuries. The scope distinction is recognised, for example, by Bacon
in his <em>Sincategoreumata</em> of the early thirteenth century (cf.
Kretzmann 1982, 219). But the role of exposition is perhaps best 
illustrated in the <em>Sophismata</em> of Albert of Saxony, dating 
from the middle of the fourteenth century. In diagnosing the 
ambiguity, Albert recognises that (S) implies a simpler, equally 
ambiguous sentence, which we might formulate as follows:</p>

<p>

(SP) Socrates did not twice see Plato.</p>

<p>

Here is what he then says:</p>

<blockquote>Now in &ldquo;Socrates did not see Plato twice&rdquo; the
whole predicate [&ldquo;did see Plato twice&rdquo;] is denied of the
whole subject; but in &ldquo;Socrates twice did not see Plato&rdquo;
not the whole predicate but a part of it is denied of the subject,
because the term &ldquo;twice&rdquo; remains affirmed. (Tr. in
Kretzmann 1982, 223.)</blockquote>

<p>

Here we might represent the two interpretations as follows:</p>

<p>

(SP#) Socrates did not (see Plato twice). [<em>Socrates non videt bis
Platonem</em>.]</p>

<p>

(SP*) Socrates twice (did not see Plato). [<em>Socrates bis non videt
Platonem</em>.]</p>

<p>

Here the ambiguity depends on the scope of &lsquo;twice&rsquo; 
(&lsquo;<em>bis</em>&rsquo;) and &lsquo;not&rsquo; 
(&lsquo;<em>non</em>&rsquo;), which Albert recognises in the way he 
formulates the two alternatives. Albert may not have been able to 
draw on the resources of modern quantificational logic to formalise 
the two interpretations, but he clearly has some understanding of the
idea of scope.</p>

<p>

The medieval literature on sophismata, syncategoremata and 
exponibilia, then, shows that interpretive analysis had an important 
role to play long before it became a central tool of modern analytic 
philosophy. In modern analytic philosophy, interpretive analysis is 
used, in particular, in eliminativist or reductive projects&mdash;in 
minimizing our ontological commitments, or revealing what our 
underlying ontological commitments are (see the supplement on 
 <a href="s6.html">Conceptions of Analysis in Analytic Philosophy</a>).
 But this too is anticipated in the medieval period&mdash;most 
notably, in the nominalist philosophies of Ockham and Buridan. Ockham
is the originator of the principle now known as Ockham&rsquo;s Razor,
and Buridan is often seen as having practised what Ockham preached. 
(On Ockham&rsquo;s nominalism, see the sections on 
 <a href="../ockham/index.html#4.1">Ockham&rsquo;s Razor</a>
 and 
 <a href="../ockham/index.html#4.3">Exposition or Parsing Away Entities</a>
 in the entry on William of Ockham, and on the similarities and 
differences between Ockham and Buridan, see the section on 
 <a href="../buridan/index.html#3">Language</a>
 in the entry on John Buridan. Cf. also Klima 2001, xxvii f.) The 
combination of interpretive analysis and reductionism, in the context
of the development of modern logic, may be what characterises one of 
the central strands in modern analytic philosophy, but the first two 
elements can also be found in medieval philosophy.</p>

<h3><a name="2">2. Renaissance Philosophy</a></h3>

<p>

During the Renaissance, with the rediscovery and translation of 
ancient Greek texts that had simply not been known in Christian 
Europe in medieval times, awareness gradually grew of the variety of 
methodologies in antiquity. This prompted widespread discussion of 
methodology, inspired by the very problem of how to deal with the 
ancient texts. Indeed, methodology itself became one of the hottest 
issues of all, as Renaissance thinkers fought to make sense of their 
great predecessors. Key figures in this debate are Petrus Ramus 
(1515-72) and Jacopo Zabarella (1533-89), who can be taken as 
representative of the two poles between which debate took place.</p>

<p>

Ramus was a savage critic of Aristotle, and proposed to replace the 
subtleties and complexities of Aristotelian logic with the single 
method of humanist dialectic, conceived as the means of systematizing
knowledge to facilitate learning and its practical use. Ramus saw 
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Organon</em> (or logical works) as a confused 
body of doctrine, which it was his task to reorganise for pedagogical
purposes, based on the simple principle that the general comes before
the specific, the whole before the part. Utilizing Plato&rsquo;s 
method of dichotomous division, Ramist works became famous (or 
infamous) for their elaborate tables and tree diagrams. Although 
Ramus drew the familiar distinction between discovery and 
demonstration, or as he called it, invention and disposition, the 
latter was clearly of greater importance to him than the former. 
According to Ramus, the discoveries had already been made by the 
ancients; the task was only to present them properly. (Cf. Gilbert 
1960, ch. 5.)</p>

<p>

This suggests that Ramus rejected the need for analysis, as 
understood in the Aristotelian tradition. But this is obscured 
somewhat by the fact that he takes &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; in a 
different sense. In logic, Ramus writes, &ldquo;analysis is the 
marshaling (<em>examen</em>) of the argument, enunciation, syllogism,
method, in short of the whole art of logic, as is prescribed in the 
First Book of the <em>Analytics</em>&rdquo; (quoted by Ong 1958, 
263). Something analogous holds in other fields. As Ong notes, 
&ldquo;Analysis, for Ramus, is thus at root a way of operating 
didactically upon a text. It belongs not to an art, but to 
<em>usus</em> or exercise&rdquo; (1958, 264). It was complemented by 
<em>genesis</em>, rather than &lsquo;synthesis&rsquo; in the sense of
&lsquo;demonstration&rsquo;. Having learnt one&rsquo;s lessons 
through analysis, one could then apply those lessons: &ldquo;Genesis 
is not the study of given examples as analysis is, but is rather the 
making of a new work&rdquo; (quoted in Ong 1958, 264). For Ramus, 
then, &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; was not a method of solving problems, 
and if it can be understood as a method of discovery, then it only 
involved learning what was already known. It is in this way that 
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo; and &lsquo;synthesis&rsquo; in the 
Aristotelian sense could be collapsed together into Ramus&rsquo;s one
simple method&mdash;the method of presenting knowledge already 
attained. It is the disregarding of the problem-solving or genuinely 
heuristic aspect of analysis, as conceived by Aristotle and the 
geometers, that Descartes was to condemn in the following century 
(see the supplementary section on 
 <a href="s4.html#2">Descartes and Analytic Geometry</a>).
 </p>

<p>

If Ramus represents the Platonist, anti-Aristotelian pole in the 
debate over method, then Zabarella represents the Aristotelian pole. 
Central to Zabarella&rsquo;s account of method was precisely 
Aristotle&rsquo;s distinction between understanding &lsquo;the 
fact&rsquo; and understanding &lsquo;the reason why&rsquo;, as 
articulated in the <em>Posterior Analytics</em>, a work on which 
Zabarella wrote a detailed commentary. According to Zabarella, the 
two methods involved here&mdash;the <em>methodus resolutiva</em> 
(analysis) and <em>methodus compositiva</em> (synthesis)&mdash;are to
be combined in providing the joint method for natural philosophy, all
other methods, such as Plato&rsquo;s method of division, being 
inadequate to generate genuine knowledge. (Cf. Copenhaver and Schmitt
1992, 118-21; N. Jardine 1988, 689-93.) Zabarella may have failed to 
recognise the importance of mathematics, which was to play a decisive
role in the forthcoming scientific revolution; but his idea of the 
double method was to influence Galileo in his inauguration of that 
revolution.</p>

<p>

If there is one method of analysis that does lie at the root of 
subsequent methods, it is that utilised in ancient Greek geometry, 
but this was not appreciated until fairly late in the Renaissance. 
Pappus&rsquo;s famous account of analysis was only translated into 
Latin by Federigo Commandino in 1589. At first, as had happened with 
other translations of Greek texts, the rendering of the Greek terms 
&lsquo;<em>analusis</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>sunthesis</em>&rsquo; 
by &lsquo;<em>resolutio</em>&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;<em>compositio</em>&rsquo; encouraged conflation of the 
various methods, but gradually, as the significance of geometrical 
analysis sunk in, the original Greek terms were reappropriated (in 
their transliterated form) to signal the more exact meaning. (Cf. 
Gilbert 1960, 81-3). The wider connotations of the terms 
&lsquo;resolution&rsquo; and &lsquo;composition&rsquo; remained, 
however, and these soon transferred themselves to the Greek terms 
too, an attachment that has persisted to the present day, causing 
confusion ever since.</p>

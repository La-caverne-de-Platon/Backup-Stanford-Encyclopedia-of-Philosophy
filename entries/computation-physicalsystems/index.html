<h1>Computation in Physical Systems</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jul 21, 2010; substantive revision Wed Jun 16, 2021</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
In our ordinary discourse, we distinguish between physical systems
that perform computations, such as computers and calculators, and
physical systems that don&rsquo;t, such as rocks and raindrops. Among
computing devices, we distinguish between more and less powerful ones.
These distinctions are of both practical and theoretical importance: a
supercomputer can compute in minutes what would take decades on a
laptop, while a calculator cannot do certain things that a laptop can
do, even in principle. What grounds these distinctions? What is the
principled difference, if there is one, between a rock and a
calculator, or between a calculator and a computer? Answering these
questions is more difficult than it may seem.</p>

<p>
In addition to our ordinary discourse, computation is central to many
sciences. Computer scientists design, build, and program computers.
But again, what counts as a computer? If a salesperson sold you an
ordinary rock as a computer, you should probably get your money back.
Again, what does the rock lack that a genuine computer has?</p>

<p>
How powerful a computer can you build? Can you build a machine that
computes anything you wish? Although it is often said that modern
computers can compute anything (i.e., any function of natural numbers,
or equivalently, any function of strings of letters from a finite
alphabet), this is incorrect. Ordinary computers can compute only a
tiny subset of these functions. Is it physically possible to do
better? Which functions are physically computable? These questions are
bound up with the foundations of physics.</p>

<p>
Computation is also central to psychology and neuroscience, and
perhaps other areas of biology. According to the computational theory
of cognition, cognition is a kind of computation: the behavior of
cognitive systems is causally explained by the computations they
perform. In order to test a computational theory of something, we need
to know what counts as a computation in a physical system. Once again,
the nature of computation lies at the foundation of empirical
science.</p>

<h2><a name="AbsComConCom">1. Abstract Computation and Concrete Computation</a></h2>

<p>
Computation may be studied mathematically by formally defining
computational objects, such as algorithms and Turing machines, and
proving theorems about their properties. The mathematical theory of
computation is a well-established branch of mathematics. It deals with
computation in the abstract, without regard to physical
implementation.</p>

<p>
By contrast, most uses of computation in science and ordinary practice
deal with concrete computation: computation in physical systems such
as computers and brains. Concrete computation is closely related to
abstract computation: we speak of physical systems as running an
algorithm or as implementing a Turing machine, for example. But the
relationship between concrete computation and abstract computation is
not part of the mathematical theory of computation and requires
further investigation (cf. Curtis-Trudel forthcoming-a, for an argument
that abstract and concrete computation cannot be given a unified
account).  Questions about concrete computation are the main subject
of this entry. Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind some
basic mathematical results.</p>

<p>
The most important notion of computation is that of <i>digital</i>
<i>computation</i>, which Alan Turing, Kurt G&ouml;del, Alonzo Church,
Emil Post, and Stephen Kleene formalized in the 1930s. Their work
investigated the foundations of mathematics. One crucial question was
whether first order logic is <i>decidable</i>&mdash;whether there is
an algorithm that determines whether any given first order logical
formula is a theorem.</p>

<p>
Turing (1936&ndash;7) and, separately, Church (1936) proved that the
answer is negative: there is no such algorithm. To show this, they
offered precise characterizations of the informal notion of an
effectively computable function. Turing did so in terms of so-called
Turing machines (TMs)&mdash;devices that manipulate discrete symbols
written on a tape in accordance with finitely many instructions. Other
logicians did the same thing&mdash;they formalized the notion of
effectively computable function&mdash;in terms of other notions, such
as &lambda;-definable functions and general recursive functions.</p>

<p>
To their surprise, all such notions turned out to be extensionally
equivalent: any function computable within any of these formalisms is
computable within any of the others. They took this as evidence that
their quest for a precise definition of &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo; or
&ldquo;effectively computable function&rdquo; had been successful. The
resulting view&mdash;that TMs and other equivalent formalisms capture
the informal notion of algorithm&mdash;is now known as the
Church-Turing thesis (more on this in Section 4). The study of
computable functions, made possible by the work of Turing <i>et
al</i>., is part of the mathematical theory of computation.</p>

<p>
The theoretical significance of Turing <i>et al</i>.&rsquo;s notion of
computation can hardly be overstated. As G&ouml;del pointed out (in a
lecture following one by Tarski):</p>

<p>
Tarski has stressed in his lecture (and I think justly) the great
importance of the concept of general recursiveness (or Turing&rsquo;s
computability). It seems to me that this importance is largely due to
the fact that with this concept one has for the first time succeeded
in giving an absolute definition of an interesting epistemological
notion, i.e., one not depending on the formalism chosen. (G&ouml;del
1946, 84)</p>

<p>
Turing also showed that there are universal TMs&mdash;machines that
can compute any function computable by any other TM. Universal
machines do this by executing instructions that encode the behavior of
the machine they simulate. Assuming the Church-Turing thesis,
universal TMs can compute any function computable by algorithm. This
result is significant for computer science: you don&rsquo;t need to build
different computers for different functions; one universal computer
will suffice to compute any computable function. Modern digital
computers are universal in this sense: digital computers can compute
any function computable by algorithm for as long as they have time and
memory. (Strictly speaking, a universal machine has an unbounded
memory, whereas digital computer memories can be extended but not
indefinitely, so they are not unbounded.)</p>

<p>
The above result should not be confused with the common claim that
computers can compute <i>anything</i>. This claim is false: another
important result of computability theory is that most functions are
<i>not</i> computable by TMs (and hence, by digital computers). TMs
compute functions defined over denumerable domains, such as strings of
letters from a finite alphabet. There are uncountably many such
functions. But there are only countably many TMs; you can enumerate
TMs by listing each TM specification (which is some finite string).
Since an uncountable infinity is much larger than a countable one, it
follows that TMs (and hence digital computers) can compute only a tiny
portion of all functions (over denumerable domains, such as natural
numbers or strings of letters).</p>

<p>
TMs and most modern computers are known as (classical) <i>digital
computers</i>, that is, computers that manipulate strings of discrete,
unambiguously distinguishable states. Digital computers are sometimes
contrasted with <i>analog</i> <i>computers</i>, which manipulate
variables that can be continuous. Continuous variables are variables
that can change their value continuously over time while taking any
value within a certain interval. Analog computers are used primarily
to solve certain systems of differential equations (Pour-El 1974,
Rubel 1993).</p>

<p>
Classical digital computers may also be contrasted with <i>quantum</i>
<i>computers</i>. Quantum computers manipulate quantum states called
qudits (usually <i>binary</i> qudits, known as qubits). Unlike the
computational states of digital computers, qudits are not
unambiguously distinguishable from one another in certain important
respects. This entry will focus primarily on classical digital
computation. For more on quantum computation, see the entry on quantum
computing.</p>

<p>
The same objects studied in the mathematical theory of
computation&mdash;TMs, algorithms, and so on&mdash;are typically said
to be implemented by concrete physical systems. This poses a problem:
how can a concrete, physical system perform a computation when
computation is defined by an abstract mathematical formalism? This may
be called the problem of computational implementation.</p>

<p>
The problem of computational implementation may be formulated in a
couple of different ways. Platonists interpret the formalisms of
computability theory as defining abstract <i>objects</i>. According to
this interpretation, TMs, algorithms, and the like are abstract
objects. But how can a concrete physical system <i>implement</i> an
abstract object, and what precisely is this implementation relation?
Anti-platonists treat the formalisms of computability theory simply as
abstract computational <i>descriptions</i>. But how can a concrete
physical system satisfy an abstract computational description?
Regardless of how the problem of computational implementation is
formulated, solving it requires an account of concrete
computation&mdash;an account of what it takes for a physical system to
perform a given computation.</p>

<p>
A closely related problem is that of distinguishing between physical
systems such as digital computers, which do compute (if anything
does), and physical systems such as rocks, which do not (or so it
seems). Unlike computers, ordinary rocks are not sold in computer
stores and are usually not considered computers. Why? What do
computers have that rocks lack such that computers compute but rocks
don&rsquo;t? (If indeed they don&rsquo;t?) In other words, what kinds of concrete
systems can compute at all? Different answers to these questions give
rise to different accounts of concrete computation.</p>

<p>
Questions about the nature of concrete computation should not be
confused with questions about computational modeling. The dynamical
evolution of many physical systems may be approximated by
computational models&mdash;computer programs that simulate or predict
the dynamics or kinematics of some system of interest. The behavior of
rocks&mdash;as well as rivers, ecosystems, and planetary systems,
among many others&mdash;may well be modeled computationally. It does
not follow that the modeled systems are computing devices&mdash;that
they themselves perform computations. Prima facie, only relatively few
and quite special systems compute. Explaining what makes them
special&mdash;or explaining away our feeling that they are
special&mdash;is the job of an account of concrete computation.</p>

<h2><a name="AccConCom">2. Accounts of Concrete Computation</a></h2>

<p>
The basic problem that any account of concrete computation must solve
can be seen via the <a href="#diagram">following diagram</a>. Consider some computational
system <i>C</i> (e.g. an abstract automaton) and a physical system
<i>P</i>. System <i>C</i> has computational states
<i>s</i><sub>1</sub><i> </i>and <i>s</i><sub>2</sub><i> </i>such that
<i>C</i> transitions from <i>s<sub>1</sub> </i>to <i>s<sub>2</sub></i>
according to the specification of <i>C.</i> System <i>P</i> has
physical states <i>p</i><sub>1</sub><i> </i>and
<i>p</i><sub>2</sub><i> </i>such that <i>P</i> transitions from
<i>p</i><sub>1</sub><i> </i>to <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> according to the
dynamics of <i>P</i>. The transitions among states of the same
type&mdash;the arrows in the diagram&mdash;are not in need of
explanation: they are either stipulated in the case of <i>C</i>, or
well-understood physical dynamics in the case of <i>P</i>. However, in
order for <i>P</i> to count as an implementation of <i>C</i>, the putative
connection between the states of one type of system and the states of
the other (the dotted lines) must be explained. The following accounts
offer different ways of characterizing this connection, either by
making precise what the dotted lines represent, by narrowing the
possible physical states or transitions that could comprise<i> P</i>,
or both.</p>

  points from s1 to s2. Similarly p2 is to the right of p1 and an
  arrow ponts from p1 to p2." />

<p class="center"><span class="figlabel">Diagram</span></p>

<h3><a name="SimMapAcc">2.1 The Simple Mapping Account</a></h3>

<p>
One of the earliest and most influential accounts of computation is
due to Hilary Putnam. To a first approximation, this account says that
anything that is accurately described by a computational description
<i>C</i> is a computing system implementing <i>C</i>.</p>

<p>
More precisely, Putnam sketches his earliest account in terms of
Turing Machines (TMs) only, appealing to the &ldquo;machine
tables&rdquo; that are a standard way of defining specific TMs. A
machine table consists of one column for each of the (finitely many)
internal states of the TM and one row for each of the machine&rsquo;s symbol
types. Each entry in the machine table specifies what the machine does
given the pertinent symbol and internal state. Here is how Putnam
explains what it takes for a physical system to be a TM:</p>

<p>
A &lsquo;machine table&rsquo; <i>describes</i> a machine if the
machine has internal states corresponding to the columns of the table,
and if it &lsquo;obeys&rsquo; the instruction in the table in the
following sense: when it is scanning a square on which a symbol
<i>s</i><sub>1</sub> appears and it is in, say, state <i>B</i>, that
it carries out the &lsquo;instruction&rsquo; in the appropriate row
and column of the table (in this case, column <i>B</i> and row
<i>s</i><sub>1</sub>). Any machine that is described by a machine
table of the sort just exemplified is a Turing machine. (Putnam
1960/1975a, 365; cf. also Putnam 1967/1975a, 433&ndash;4)</p>

<p>
This account relies on several unexplained notions, such as square (of
tape), symbol, scanning, and carrying out an instruction. Furthermore,
the account is specified in terms of TM tables, but there are other
kinds of computational description. A general account of concrete
computation should cover other computational descriptions besides TM
tables. Perhaps for these reasons, Putnam&mdash;soon followed by many
others&mdash;abandoned reference to squares, symbols, etc.; he
substituted them with an appeal to a physical description of the
system. The result of that substitution is what Godfrey-Smith (2009)
dubs the &ldquo;simple mapping account&rdquo; of computation.</p>

<p>
According to the simple mapping account, a physical system <i>S</i>
performs a computation defined by description <i>C</i> just in case
(i) there is a mapping from the states ascribed to <i>S</i> by a
physical description to the states defined by computational
description <i>C</i>, such that (ii) the state transitions between the
physical states mirror the state transitions between the computational
states. Thus, suppose <i>S</i> has states <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> and
<i>p</i><sub>2</sub> that map on states <i>s</i><sub>1</sub> and
<i>s</i><sub>2</sub> of <i>C</i> (respectively). Clause (ii) requires
that, for any computational state transition of the form
<i>s</i><sub>1</sub> &rarr; <i>s</i><sub>2</sub>, <i>S</i> transitions
from <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> to <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> whenever it goes
into state <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>.</p>

<p>
One difficulty with the formulation above is that ordinary physical
systems admit of uncountably many physical states, whereas ordinary
computational descriptions, such as TM tables, consist of countably
many states. Thus, there are not enough computational states for the
physical states to map onto. One solution to this problem is to
reverse the direction of the mapping, requiring a mapping of the
computational states onto (a subset of) the physical states. Another,
more common solution to this problem&mdash;often implicit&mdash;is to
select either a subset of the physical states or equivalence classes
of the physical states and map those onto the computational states.
When this is done, clause (i) is replaced by the following: (i&prime;)
there is a mapping from <i>a subset of</i> (or <i>equivalence classes
of</i>) the physical states of <i>S</i> to the states of computational
description <i>C</i>.</p>

<p>
The simple mapping account turns out to be very liberal: it attributes
many computations to many systems. In the absence of restrictions on
which mappings are acceptable, such mappings are relatively easy to
come by. As a consequence, some have argued that every physical system
implements every computation (Putnam 1988, Searle 1992). This thesis,
which trivializes the claim that something is a computing system, will
be discussed in Section 3.1. Meanwhile, the desire to avoid this
trivialization result is one motivation behind other accounts of
concrete computation.</p>

<h3><a name="CauCouDisAcc">2.2 Causal, Counterfactual, and Dispositional Accounts</a></h3>

<p>
One way to construct more restrictive accounts of computation is to
further constrain acceptable mappings. As a reminder, the simple
mapping account has it that, for any computational state transition of
the form <i>s</i><sub>1</sub> &rarr; <i>s</i><sub>2</sub>, if the
system is in the physical state <i>p</i><sub>1 </sub>that maps onto
<i>s</i><sub>1</sub>, it then goes into the physical state
<i>p</i><sub>2</sub> that maps onto <i>s</i><sub>2</sub>. The second
part of (ii) is a material conditional. This account may be
strengthened by turning it into a conditional expressing a relation
that supports counterfactuals.</p>

<p>
In a pure counterfactual account, clause (ii) is strengthened by
requiring that the physical state transitions support certain
counterfactuals (Block 1978, Maudlin 1989, Copeland 1996, Rescorla
2014, Campbell and Yang 2021). In other words, this account requires
the mapping between computational and physical descriptions to be such
that the counterfactual relations between the physical states are
isomorphic to the counterfactual relations between the computational
states.</p>

<p>
Different authors formulate the relevant counterfactuals in slightly
different ways: (a) if the system had been in a physical state that
maps onto an arbitrary computational state (specified by the relevant
computational description), it would have gone into a physical state
that maps onto the relevant subsequent computational state (Maudlin
1989, 415); (b) if the system had been in a physical state
<i>p</i><sub>1</sub> that maps onto <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>, it would
have gone into a physical state <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> that maps onto
<i>s</i><sub>2</sub> (Copeland 1996, 341); (c) if the system were in a
physical state <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> that maps onto
<i>s</i><sub>1</sub>, it would go into a physical state
<i>p</i><sub>2</sub> that maps onto <i>s</i><sub>2</sub> (Chalmers
1996, 312). Regardless of the exact formulation, none of these
counterfactuals are satisfied by the material conditional of clause
(ii) as it appears in the simple mapping account of computation. Thus,
counterfactual accounts are stronger than the simple mapping
account.</p>

<p>
In causal accounts, clause (ii) is strengthened by requiring a causal
relation between the physical states: for any computational state
transition of the form <i>s</i><sub>1</sub> &rarr;
<i>s</i><sub>2</sub>, the physical state <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> (which
maps onto computational state <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>) <i>causes</i> the
system to go into physical state <i>p</i><sub>2 </sub>(which maps onto
computational state <i>s</i><sub>2</sub>) (Chrisley 1995, Chalmers
1995, 1996, 2011, Scheutz 1999, 2001).</p>

<p>
In order to avoid unlimited pancomputationalism, (discussed in Section
3), Chalmers (1995, 1996, 2011) adds the further restriction that a
physical implementation of a computational system must divide into
separate physical components, each of which maps onto the components
specified by the computational formalism. As Godfrey-Smith (2009, 293)
notes, this combination of a causal and a <i>localizational</i>
constraint goes in the direction of mechanistic explanation (Machamer,
Darden, and Craver 2000). An account of computation that is explicitly
based on mechanistic explanation will be discussed in Section 2.5. For
now, the causal account requires only that the mappings between
computational and physical descriptions be such that the causal
relations between the physical states are isomorphic to the state
transitions specified by the computational description. Thus,
according to the causal account, concrete computation is the causal
structure of a physical process.</p>

<p>
Another account of concrete computation appeals to dispositional
relations, assuming (as most people do) that dispositional relations
support counterfactuals. Appealing to dispositions may have advantages
over pure counterfactual accounts in blocking unwanted computational
implementations (Klein 2008, 145, makes the case for dispositional
versus counterfactual accounts).</p>

<p>
In a dispositional account, clause (ii) is strengthened by requiring a
dispositional relation between the physical states: for any
computational state transition of the form <i>s</i><sub>1</sub> &rarr;
<i>s</i><sub>2</sub> (specified by a computational description), if
the system is in the physical state <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> that maps
onto <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>, the system <i>manifests a disposition</i>
whose manifestation is the transition from <i>p</i><sub>1 </sub>to the
physical state <i>p</i><sub>2 </sub>that maps onto
<i>s</i><sub>2</sub> (Klein 2008). The physical system is such that
physical state <i>p</i><sub>1</sub> (which maps onto computational
state <i>s</i><sub>1</sub>) manifests the disposition to transition to
physical state <i>p</i><sub>2</sub> (which maps onto computational
state <i>s</i><sub>2</sub>). In other words, the dispositional account
requires the mapping between computational and physical descriptions
to be such that the dispositional relations between the physical
states are isomorphic to the state transitions specified by the
computational description. Thus, according to the dispositional
account, concrete computation is the dispositional structure of a
physical process.</p>

<p>
The difference between the simple mapping account and counterfactual,
causal, and dispositional accounts may be seen by looking at an
example.</p>

<p>
Consider a rock under the sun, early in the morning. During any time
interval, the rock&rsquo;s temperature rises, going from <i>T</i> to
<i>T</i>+1, to <i>T</i>+2, to <i>T</i>+3. Now consider a NOT gate that
feeds its output back to itself. At first, suppose the NOT gate
receives &lsquo;0&rsquo; as an input; it then returns a
&lsquo;1&rsquo;. After the &lsquo;1&rsquo; is fed back to the NOT
gate, the gate returns a &lsquo;0&rsquo; again, and so on. The NOT
gate goes back and forth between outputting a &lsquo;0&rsquo; and
outputting a &lsquo;1&rsquo;. Now map physical states <i>T</i> and
<i>T</i>+2 onto &lsquo;0&rsquo;; then map <i>T</i>+1 and <i>T</i>+3
onto &lsquo;1&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
According to the simple mapping account, the rock implements a NOT
gate undergoing the computation represented by &lsquo;0101&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
By contrast, according to the counterfactual account, the rock&rsquo;s
putative computational implementation is spurious, because the
physical state transitions do not support counterfactuals. If the rock
were put in state <i>T</i>, it may or may not transition into
<i>T</i>+1, depending on whether it is morning or evening and other
extraneous factors. Since the rock&rsquo;s physical state transitions that
map onto the NOT gate&rsquo;s computational state transitions do not support
counterfactuals, the rock does not implement the NOT gate according to
the counterfactual account.</p>

<p>
According to the causal and dispositional accounts too, this putative
computational implementation is spurious, because the physical state
transitions are not due to causal or dispositional properties of the
rock and its states. <i>T</i> does not cause <i>T</i>+1, nor does the
rock have a disposition to go into <i>T</i>+1 when it is in <i>T</i>.
Rather, the rock changes its state due to the action of the sun. Since
the rock&rsquo;s physical state transitions that map onto the NOT gate&rsquo;s
computational state transitions are not grounded in either the causal
or dispositional properties of the rock and its states, the rock does
not implement the NOT gate according to the causal and dispositional
accounts.</p>

<p>
It is important to note that under all of these mapping accounts,
there are mappings between <i>any</i> physical system and at least
some computational descriptions. Thus, according to mapping accounts,
everything performs at least some computations (cf. Section 3.2). This
strikes some as overly inclusive. In computer science and cognitive
science, there seems to be a distinction between systems that compute
and systems that do not. To preserve this distinction, one option is
to move beyond mapping accounts of implementation.</p>

<h3><a name="SemAcc">2.3 The Semantic Account</a></h3>

<p>
In our everyday life, we usually employ computations to process
meaningful symbols in order to extract information from them. The
semantic account of computation turns this practice into a
metaphysical doctrine: computation <i>is</i> the processing of
representations&mdash;or at least, the processing of appropriate
representations in appropriate ways. Opinions as to which
representational manipulations constitute computation vary a great
deal (Fodor 1975; Cummins 1983; Pylyshyn 1984; Churchland and
Sejnowski 1992; Shagrir 2006, forthcoming). What all versions of the
semantic account have in common is that they take seriously the
reference to symbols in Putnam&rsquo;s original account of computation:
there is &ldquo;no computation without representation&rdquo; (Fodor
1981, 180).</p>

<p>
The semantic account may be seen as imposing a further restriction on
acceptable mappings. In addition to the causal restriction imposed by
the causal account (mutatis mutandis for the counterfactual and
dispositional accounts), the semantic account imposes a semantic
restriction. Only physical states that qualify as representations may
be mapped onto computational descriptions, thereby qualifying as
computational states. If a state is not representational, it is not
computational either.</p>

<p>
The semantic account is probably the most popular in the philosophy of
mind, because it appears to best fit what is required of a
philosophical account of cognition. Since minds and digital computers
are generally assumed to manipulate (the right kind of)
representations, they turn out to compute. Since most other systems
are generally assumed <i>not</i> to manipulate (the relevant kind of)
representations, they do not compute. Thus, the semantic account
appears to accommodate some common intuitions about what does and does
not count as a computing system. It keeps minds and computers in while
leaving most everything else out, thereby vindicating the
computational theory of cognition as a strong and nontrivial
theory.</p>

<p>
The semantic account raises three important questions. First, how are
representations to be individuated? Second, what counts as a
representation of the relevant kind? Finally, what gives
representations their semantic content?</p>

<p>
The main debate regarding the individuation of computational states
divides internalists from externalists. According to externalists,
computational vehicles are symbols individuated by their wide
<i>cognitive</i> contents&mdash;paradigmatically, the things that the
symbols stand for (Burge 1986, Shapiro 1997, Shagrir 2001). By
contrast, most internalists maintain that computational vehicles are
symbols individuated by narrow <i>cognitive</i> contents (Segal 1991).
Narrow contents are, roughly speaking, semantic contents defined in
terms of intrinsic properties of the system. <i>Cognitive</i>
contents, in turn, are contents ascribed to a system by a cognitive
psychological theory. For instance, the cognitive contents of the
visual system are visual contents, whereas the cognitive contents of
the auditory system are auditory contents.</p>

<p>
To illustrate the dispute, consider two physically identical cognitive
systems <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. Among the symbols processed by <i>A</i>
is symbol <i>S</i>. <i>A</i> produces instances of <i>S</i> whenever
<i>A</i> is in front of bodies of water, when <i>A</i> is thinking of
water, when <i>A</i> is forming plans to interact with water, and so
on. In short, symbol <i>S</i> appears to stand for water. Every time
<i>A</i> processes <i>S</i>, system <i>B</i> processes symbol
<i>S</i>&prime;, which is physically identical to <i>S</i>. But system
<i>B</i> lives in an environment different from <i>A</i>&rsquo;s
environment. Whenever <i>A</i> is surrounded by water, <i>B</i> is
surrounded by twin-water, which is a substance superficially
indistinguishable, yet physically different, from water. Thus, symbol
<i>S</i>&prime; appears to stand for twin-water (cf. Putnam 1975b). In
summary, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> live in relevantly different
environments, such that <i>S</i> appears to stand for water while
<i>S</i>&prime; appears to stand for twin-water; <i>A</i> processes
<i>S</i> in the same way that <i>B</i> processes <i>S</i>&prime;; and
there is no intrinsic physical difference between <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i> or between <i>S</i> and <i>S</i>&prime;.</p>

<p>
According to externalists, when <i>A</i> is processing <i>S</i> and
<i>B</i> is processing <i>S</i>&prime;, they are in computational
states of <i>different</i> types. According to internalists, <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i> are in computational states of the <i>same</i> type. In
other words, externalists maintain that computational states are
individuated in part by their reference, which is determined at least
in part by physical properties external to the system. By contrast,
internalists maintain that computational states are individuated in a
way that depends solely on the intrinsic physical properties of
cognitive systems.</p>

<p>
So far, externalists and internalists agree on one thing:
computational states are individuated by <i>cognitive</i> contents.
This requirement can be relaxed without abandoning the semantic
account of computation. According to Egan (1999), computational
vehicles are not individuated by cognitive contents of any kind,
whether wide or narrow. Rather, they are individuated by their
<i>mathematical</i> contents&mdash;that is, mathematical functions and
objects ascribed as semantic contents to the computational vehicles by
a computational theory of the system. Since mathematical contents are
the same across physical duplicates, Egan maintains that her
mathematical contents are a kind of narrow content&mdash;she is a kind
of internalist.</p>

<p>
Let us now turn to what counts as a representation. This debate is
less clearly delineated. According to some authors, only structures
that have a language-like combinatorial syntax, which supports a
compositional semantics, count as computational vehicles, and only
manipulations that respect the semantic properties of such structures
count as computations (Fodor 1975, Pylyshyn 1984). This suggestion
flies in the face of both computability theory and analog computation
(Maley forthcoming), neither of which impose any such requirement on
what counts as a computational vehicle.</p>

<p>
Other authors are more inclusive on what kinds of manipulations on
representations count as computations, but they have not been
especially successful in drawing the line between computational and
non-computational processes. Few would include all manipulations of
representations&mdash;including, say, painting a picture or recording
a speech&mdash;as computations, but there is no consensus on where to
draw the boundary between representational manipulations that count as
computations and representational manipulations that do not.</p>

<p>
A third question is what gives representations their semantic content.
There are three families of views. Instrumentalists believe that
ascribing semantic content to things is just heuristically useful for
prediction and explanation; semantic properties are not real
properties of computational states (e.g., Dennett 1987, Egan 2010).
Realists who are not naturalists believe semantic properties are real
properties of computational states, but they are irreducible to
non-semantic properties. Finally, realists who are also naturalists
believe semantic properties are both real and reducible to
non-semantic properties, though they disagree on exactly how to reduce
them (e.g., Fodor 2008, Harman 1987).</p>

<p>
The semantic account of computation is closely related to the common
view that computation is information processing. This idea is less
clear than it may seem, because there are several relevant notions of
information. The connection between information processing and
computation is different depending on which notion of information is
at stake. What follows is a brief disambiguation of the view that
computation is information processing based on four relevant notions
of information (cf. Piccinini and Scarantino 2011).</p>

<ol>

<li>Information in the sense of thermodynamics is closely related to
<i>thermodynamic entropy</i>. Entropy is a property of every physical
system. Thermodynamic entropy is, roughly, a measure of an observer&rsquo;s
uncertainty about the microscopic state of a system after she
considers the observable macroscopic properties of the system. The
study of the thermodynamics of computation is a lively field with many
implications in the foundations of physics (Leff and Rex 2003). In
this thermodynamic sense of &ldquo;information,&rdquo; any difference
between two distinguishable states of a system may be said to carry
information. Computation may well be said to be information processing
in this sense, but this has little to do with semantics properly so
called. However, the connections between thermodynamics, computation,
and information theory are one possible source of inspiration for the
view that every physical system is a computing system (see Section
3.4).</li>

<li>Information in the sense of information theory is a measure of the
likelihood that a given event occurs, and the mutual information of
two random variables is a measure of the mutual dependence between the
variables (Shannon and Weaver 1949). These measures can then be used
to analyze and design robust communication systems that reliably
transfer signals in the presence of noise. Computation may well be
said to be information processing in this sense as well. Again, this
is not explicitly about semantics. But mutual information can tell us
how much information a variable carries about another, so mutual
information may be the basis for a notion of semantic information
carried by a variable about another (cf. Isaac 2019).</li>

<li>Information in one semantic sense is approximately the same as
&ldquo;natural meaning&rdquo; (Grice 1957). A signal carries
information in this sense just in case it reliably correlates with a
source (Dretske 1981). The view that computation is information
processing in this sense is prima facie implausible, because many
computations&mdash;such as arithmetical calculations carried out on
digital computers&mdash;do not seem to carry any natural meaning.
Nevertheless, this notion of semantic information is relevant here
because it has been used by some theorists to ground an account of
representation (Dretske 1981, Fodor 2008).</li>

<li>Information in another semantic sense is just ordinary semantic
content or &ldquo;non-natural meaning&rdquo; (Grice 1957). This is the
kind of semantic content that most philosophers discuss. The view that
computation is information processing in this sense is similar to a
generic semantic account of computation.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Although the semantic account of computation appears to fit the needs
of philosophers of mind, it appears less suited to make sense of other
sciences. Most pertinently, representation does not seem to be
presupposed by the notion of computation employed in at least some
areas of cognitive science as well as computability theory and
computer science&mdash;the very sciences that gave rise to the notion
of computation and the origin of the computational theory of cognition
(Fresco 2010). If this is correct, the semantic account may not even
be adequate to the needs of philosophers of mind&mdash;at least those
philosophers of mind who wish to make sense of the analogy between
minds and the systems designed and studied by computer scientists and
computability theorists. Another criticism of the semantic account is
that specifying the kind of representation and representational
manipulation that is relevant to computation may require a
non-semantic way of individuating computations (Piccinini 2004). These
concerns motivate efforts to account for computation in non-semantic
terms.</p>

<h3><a name="SynAcc">2.4 The Syntactic Account</a></h3>

<p>
As we saw, the semantic account needs to specify which representations
are relevant to computation. One view is that the relevant
representations are language-like, that is, they have the kind of
syntactic structure exhibited by sentences in a language. Computation,
then, is the manipulation of language-like representations in a way
that is sensitive to their syntactic structure and preserves their
semantic properties (Fodor 1975).</p>

<p>
As discussed in the previous section, however, using the notion of
representation in an account of computation involves some
difficulties. If computation could be accounted for without appealing
to representation, those difficulties would be avoided. One way to do
so is to maintain that computation simply is the manipulation of
language-like structures via the manipulation of their syntactic
properties, leaving semantics by the wayside. The structures being
manipulated are assumed to be language-like only in that they have
syntactic properties&mdash;they need not have any semantics. In this
syntactic account of computation, the notion of representation is not
used at all.</p>

<p>
The semantic account attempts to solve the problem of implementation
by imposing a semantic restriction on acceptable mappings between
physical and computational states; only physical states that count as
(the right sort of) representations may be mapped onto computational
states. In contrast, the syntactic account may be seen as replacing
this semantic restriction: only physical states that qualify as
syntactic may be mapped onto computational states, thereby qualifying
as computational states. If a state lacks syntactic structure, it is
not computational.</p>

<p>
What remains to be seen is what counts as a syntactic state. An
important account of syntax in the physical world is due to Stephen
Stich (1983, 150&ndash;157). Although Stich does not use the term
&ldquo;computation,&rdquo; his account of syntax is aimed at grounding
a syntactic account of mental states and processes. Stich&rsquo;s syntactic
theory of mind is, in turn, his interpretation of the computational
theories proposed by cognitive scientists&mdash;in competition with
Fodor&rsquo;s semantic interpretation. Since Stich&rsquo;s account of syntax is
ultimately aimed at grounding computational theories of cognition,
Stich&rsquo;s account of syntax also provides an (implicit) syntactic
account of computation.</p>

<p>
According to Stich, roughly speaking, a physical system contains
syntactically structured objects when two conditions are satisfied.
First, there is a mapping between the behaviorally relevant physical
states of the system and a class of syntactic types, which are
specified by a grammar that defines how complex syntactic types can be
formed out of (finitely many) primitive syntactic types. Second, the
behavior of the system is explained by a theory whose generalizations
are formulated in terms of formal relations between the syntactic
types that map onto the physical states of the system.</p>

<p>
The syntactic account of computation is not very popular. A common
objection is that it seems difficult to give an account of primitive
syntactic types that does not presuppose a prior semantic
individuation of the types (Crane 1990, Jacquette 1991, Bontly 1998).
In fact, it is common to make sense of syntax by construing it as a
way to combine symbols, that is, semantically interpreted
constituents. If syntax is construed in this way, it presupposes
semantics. If so, the syntactic account of computation collapses into
the semantic account.</p>

<p>
Another objection is that language-like syntactic structure is not
necessary for computation as it is understood in computer science and
computability theory. Although computing systems surely can manipulate
language-like structures, they don&rsquo;t have to. They can also manipulate
simple sequences of letters, without losing their identity as
computers. (Computability theorists call any set of words from a
finite alphabet a language, but that broad notion of language should
not be confused with the narrower notion&mdash;inspired by grammars in
logic and linguistics&mdash;that Stich employs in his syntactic
account of computation.)</p>

<h3><a name="MecAcc">2.5 The Mechanistic Account</a></h3>

<p>
The mechanistic account (Piccinini 2007, 2015; cf. Kaplan 2011,
Milkowski 2013, Fresco 2014, Duwell 2017, Coelho Mollo 2018,
Curtis-Trudel forthcoming-b) avoids appealing to both syntax and
semantics. Instead, it accounts for concrete computation in terms of
the mechanistic properties of a system. According to the mechanistic
account, concrete computing systems are functional mechanisms of a
special kind&mdash;mechanisms that perform concrete computations.</p>

<p>
A functional mechanism is a system of organized components, each of
which has functions to perform (cf. Craver 2012, Garson 2013). When
appropriate components and their functions are appropriately organized
and functioning properly, their combined activities constitute the
capacities of the mechanism. Conversely, when we look for an
explanation of the capacities of a mechanism, we decompose the
mechanism into its components and look for their functions and
organization. The result is a mechanistic explanation of the
mechanism&rsquo;s capacities.</p>

<p>
This notion of mechanism is familiar to biologists and engineers. Both
explain capacities of the system in question (e.g., digestion or
respiration for the biologist, memory access or multiplication for the
computer engineer) in terms of the functions performed by systems of
organized components (e.g., the digestive system and the respiratory
system, or the memory system and the processor).</p>

<p>
According to the mechanistic account, a computation in the generic
sense is the processing of vehicles according to rules that are
sensitive to certain vehicle properties and, specifically, to
differences between different portions of the vehicles. The processing
is performed by a functional mechanism, that is, a mechanism whose
components are functionally organized to perform the computation.
Thus, if the mechanism malfunctions, a miscomputation occurs.</p>

<p>
Digital computation, analog computation, etc. turn out to be species
of generic computation. They are differentiated by more specific
properties of the vehicles being processed. If a computing system
processes strings of discrete states, then it performs a digital
computation. If a computing system processes variables that can be
continuous, then it performs an analog computation (but see Maley,
forthcoming, for an alternative account). If a computing system
processes qubits, then it performs a quantum computation.</p>

<p>
When we define concrete computations and the vehicles that they
manipulate, we need not consider all of their specific physical
properties, but only those properties that are relevant to the
computation, according to the rules that define the computation. A
physical system can be described more or less abstractly. According to
the mechanistic account, an abstract description of a physical system
is not a description of an abstract object but rather a description of
a concrete system that omits certain details. Descriptions of concrete
computations and their vehicles are sufficiently abstract as to be
defined independently of the physical media that implement them in
particular cases. Because of this, concrete computations and their
vehicles are sometimes said to be &lsquo;medium-independent&rsquo; or
&lsquo;substrate neutral&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
In other words, a vehicle is medium-independent just in case the rules
(i.e., the input-output maps) that define the relevant computation are
sensitive only to differences between portions of the vehicles along
specific dimensions of variation&mdash;they are insensitive to any
more concrete physical properties of the vehicles. Put yet another
way, the rules are functions of state variables associated with a set
of functionally relevant degrees of freedom, which can be implemented
differently in different physical media. Thus, a given computation can
be implemented in multiple physical media (e.g., mechanical,
electro-mechanical, electronic, magnetic, etc.), provided that the
media possess a sufficient number of dimensions of variation (or
degrees of freedom) that can be appropriately accessed and manipulated
and that the components of the mechanism are functionally organized in
the appropriate way.</p>

<p>
Like the semantic and syntactic accounts, the mechanistic account aims
to avoid pancomputationalism. First, physical systems that are not
functional mechanisms are ruled out. Functional mechanisms are complex
systems of components that are organized to perform functions. Any
system whose components are not organized to perform functions is not
a computing system because it is not a functional mechanism. Second,
mechanisms that lack the function of manipulating medium-independent
vehicles are ruled out. Finally, medium-independent vehicle
manipulators whose manipulations fail to accord with appropriate rules
are ruled out. The second and third constraints appeal to special
functional properties&mdash;manipulating medium-independent vehicles,
doing so in accordance with rules defined over the vehicles&mdash;that
are possessed only by relatively few physical systems. According to
the mechanistic account, those few systems are the genuine computing
systems.</p>

<p>
Another feature of the mechanistic account is that it accounts for the
possibility of miscomputation&mdash;a possibility difficult to make
sense of under other accounts. To illustrate the point, consider an
ordinary computer programmed to compute function <i>f</i> on input
<i>i</i>. Suppose that the computer malfunctions and produces an
output different from <i>f</i>(<i>i</i>). According to the causal
(semantic) account, the computer just underwent a causal process (a
manipulation of representations), which may be given a computational
description and hence counts as computing some function
<i>g</i>(<i>i</i>), where <i>g </i>&ne; <i>f</i>. By contrast,
according to the mechanistic account, the computer simply failed to
compute, or at least it failed to complete its computation correctly.
Given the importance of avoiding miscomputations in the design and use
of computers, the ability of the mechanistic account to make sense of
miscomputation may be an advantage over rival accounts (Dewhurst 2018,
Tucker 2018).</p>

<p>
A final feature of the mechanistic account is that it precisely
distinguishes and characterizes many different kinds of computing
systems based on the specific vehicles they manipulate and their
specific mechanistic properties. The mechanistic account has been used
to explicate digital computation, analog computation, computation by
neural networks, and other important distinctions such as hardwired
vs. programmable and serial vs. parallel computation (Piccinini
2015).</p>

<h2><a name="EvePhySysCom">3. Is Every Physical System Computational?</a></h2>

<p>
Which physical systems perform computations? According to
pancomputationalism, they all do. Even rocks, hurricanes, and
planetary systems&mdash;contrary to appearances&mdash;are computing
systems. Although it may seem counterintuitive, this view is quite
popular among some philosophers and physicists.</p>

<h3><a name="VarPan">3.1 Varieties of Pancomputationalism</a></h3>

<p>
Varieties of pancomputationalism vary along two dimensions. First,
they vary with respect to <i>how many</i> computations&mdash;all,
many, a few, or just one&mdash;they attribute to each system. We will
call this the <i>quantitative dimension</i>. Second, they vary with
respect to <i>why</i> these computations are attributable to physical
systems. We will call this the <i>source dimension</i>.</p>

<p>
The weakest version of pancomputationalism along the quantitative
dimension is that every physical system performs at least one
computation (Scheutz 2001). This version may be called <i>limited
pancomputationalism</i>.</p>

<p>
The strongest version of pancomputationalism is that every physical
system performs <i>every</i> computation&mdash;or at least, every
sufficiently complex system implements a very large number of
non-equivalent computations (Putnam 1988, Searle 1992). This may be
called <i>unlimited pancomputationalism</i>.</p>

<p>
One purported source of pancomputationalism is that the computation(s)
a system performs is a matter of relatively free interpretation. If
the computation a system performs depends solely or primarily on how
the system is interpreted, as opposed to objective fact, then it seems
that everything computes because everything may be seen as computing
(Searle 1992). This may be called <i>interpretivist
pancomputationalism</i>.</p>

<p>
Another purported source of pancomputationalism is that computation is
simply the causal or dynamical structure of physical processes, as the
causal account of computation (Section 2.2) maintains (Chrisley 1995,
Chalmers 1995, 1996, Scheutz 1999, 2001). Assuming that everything has
causal structure, it follows that everything performs the computation
constituted by its causal structure. This may be called <i>causal
pancomputationalism</i>.</p>

<p>
A third purported source of pancomputationalism results from the idea
that every physical state carries information, coupled with an
information-based semantics and a liberal version of the semantic view
of computation. According to the semantic view of computation,
computation is the manipulation of representations. According to
information-based semantics, a representation is anything that carries
information. Assuming that every physical state carries information,
it follows that every physical system performs the computations
constituted by the manipulation of its information-carrying states
(cf. Shagrir 2006).</p>

<p>
The final purported source of pancomputationalism is that computation
itself is the nature of the physical universe. According to some
physicists, the physical world is computational at its most
fundamental level; this is sometimes put in slogan form as the
&ldquo;it from bit&rdquo; view (Wheeler 1989). We will discuss this
view further in Section 3.4.</p>

<h3><a name="UnlPan">3.2 Unlimited Pancomputationalism</a></h3>

<p>
Arguments for unlimited pancomputationalism go back to Hinckfuss&rsquo;s
pail, a putative counterexample to computational
functionalism&mdash;the view that the mind is the software of the
brain. Hinckfuss&rsquo;s pail is named after its proponent, Ian Hinckfuss,
but was first discussed in print by William Lycan. A pail of water
contains a huge number of microscopic processes:</p>

<p>
Now is all this activity not complex enough that, simply by chance, it
might realize a human program for a brief period (given suitable
correlations between certain micro-events and the requisite input-,
output-, and state-symbols of the program)? (Lycan 1981, 39)</p>

<p>
Hinckfuss&rsquo;s implied answer to this question is that yes, a pail of
water might implement a human program (or any arbitrary computation),
at least for a short time.</p>

<p>
Other authors developed more detailed arguments along the lines of
Hinckfuss&rsquo;s pail. Searle (1992) explicitly argues that whether a
physical system implements a computation depends on how an observer
interprets the system; therefore, for any sufficiently complex object
and for any computation, the object can be described as implementing
the computation. The first rigorous argument for unlimited
pancomputationalism is due to Putnam (1988), who argues that every
ordinary open system implements every abstract finite automaton
(without inputs and outputs).</p>

<p>
Putnam considers what is essentially a generalization of the example
of the rock from Section 2.2, which was an example of a simple finite
automaton transitioning through a sequence of computational states
without input or output. An arbitrary physical system that undergoes
(possibly continuous) physical transitions can be discretized such
that its physical states map onto the computational states of an
arbitrary automaton, thus mapping physical state transitions to
computational state transitions. Because the physical system and the
automaton are arbitrary, every physical system implements every finite
automaton.</p>

<p>
This example does not include inputs and outputs (which are presumably
necessary for computational explanations), so Putnam introduces a
small change to allow for automata with inputs and outputs. The idea
is similar, except one must take into account an isomorphic mapping
between physical states (considered as inputs and outputs) and the
inputs and outputs of the relevant automaton. This restriction result
in a weaker conclusion: instead of <i>every</i> physical system
implementing <i>every </i>finite automaton, any given physical system
implements a countably infinite number of finite automata (namely,
those that produce the correct input/output pairs). This is because,
for any arbitrary input/output pair &lt;<i>i</i>, <i>o</i>&gt;, there
are countably infinitely many automata that produce output <i>o</i>
when given input <i>i</i> (see Appendix of Putnam 1988 for
details).</p>

<p>
If unlimited pancomputationalism is correct, then the claim that a
system <i>S</i> performs a certain computation becomes trivially true
and thus vacuous or nearly so; it fails to distinguish <i>S</i> from
anything else (or perhaps from anything else with the same inputs and
outputs). Thus, unlimited pancomputationalism threatens the utility of
the computational theory of cognition. If cognition is computation
simply because cognitive systems, like everything else, may be seen as
performing more or less arbitrary computations over the relevant
inputs, then it appears that the computational theory of cognition is
both trivial and vacuous (though see Schweizer 2019 for an attempt to
resist this conclusion). By the same token, unlimited
pancomputationalism threatens some of the relevance of theoretical
computer science to physical computation. For example, computational
complexity theory classifies computational systems based on the
complexity of their computations; if any physical system can implement
any computational system regardless of its computational complexity,
those results are immaterial to concrete computations. This threat of
trivialization is a major motivation behind responses to the arguments
for unlimited pancomputationalism.</p>

<p>
Notably, arguments for unlimited pancomputationalism rely either
implicitly or explicitly on the simple mapping account of computation.
They assume that an arbitrary mapping from a computational description
<i>C</i> to a physical description of a system is sufficient to
conclude that the system implements <i>C</i>. In fact, avoiding
unlimited pancomputationalism is a major motivation for rejecting the
simple mapping account of computation. By imposing restrictions on
which mappings are legitimate, other accounts of computation aim to
avoid unlimited pancomputationalism.</p>

<p>
In one response to unlimited pancomputationalism, Copeland (1996)
argues that the mappings the thesis relies on are illegitimate because
they are constructed ex post facto&mdash;after the computation is
already given. In the case of genuine computation&mdash;the kind
normally used in science&mdash; the work of generating successive
descriptions of a system&rsquo;s physical dynamics is done by a computer
running an appropriate program (e.g., a weather forecasting program);
this is the point of using a computer in the first place. If the
physical dynamics were already known&mdash;which is required for an ex
post facto computational description&mdash;then using a computer would
be unnecessary.</p>

<p>
In addition, both Chalmers (1995, 1996) and Copeland (1996) argue that
the mappings invoked by unlimited pancomputationalism violate the
counterfactual relations between the computational states, which are
required by the counterfactual mapping account, mentioned above.
Consider again Putnam&rsquo;s slice-and-aggregate strategy for generating
mappings. The mappings are constructed based on an arbitrary dynamical
evolution of an arbitrary physical system. No attempt is made to
establish what would happen to the physical system had conditions been
different. Chalmers and Copeland argue that this is illegitimate, as a
genuine implementation must exhibit the same counterfactual relations
that obtain between the computational states. This response lends
support to the counterfactual mapping account of computation.</p>

<p>
Other responses to unlimited pancomputationalism point out that
transitions between physical states are not causal in nature. The
computational description Putnam relies on maps onto a physical
description such that the computational description does not describe
the causal structure of the physical system. According to several
authors, non-causal mappings are illegitimate (Chrisley 1995, Chalmers
1995, 1996, 2011, Scheutz 1999, 2001). This type of response lends
support to the causal mapping account of computation.</p>

<p>
Yet another response to unlimited pancomputationalism is implicitly
given by Godfrey-Smith (2009). Although Godfrey-Smith is primarily
concerned with functionalism rather than computation, his argument is
still relevant here. Godfrey-Smith argues that for a mapping to
constitute a genuine implementation, the microscopic physical states
that are clustered together (to correspond to a given computational
state) must be physically <i>similar</i> to one another&mdash;there
cannot be arbitrary groupings of arbitrarily different physical
states, as in the arguments for unlimited pancomputationalism.
Godfrey-Smith suggests that his similarity restriction on legitimate
mappings may be complemented by the kind of causal and localizational
restrictions proposed by Chalmers (1996).</p>

<p>
The remaining accounts of computation&mdash;the semantic, syntactic,
and mechanistic accounts&mdash;are even more restrictive than the
causal and counterfactual accounts; they impose further constraints on
acceptable mappings. Therefore, like the causal and counterfactual
accounts, they have resources for avoiding unlimited
pancomputationalism.</p>

<p>
For example, consider the semantic account, according to which
computation requires representation. If being a representation is an
objective property possessed by relatively few things, then unlimited
pancomputationalism is ruled out on the grounds that only the few
items that constitute representations are genuine computational
states. If everything is representational in the relevant way,
however, then everything is computational (cf. Churchland and
Sejnowski 1992, Shagrir 2006). If, in addition, whether something is a
representation is a matter of interpretation, then the semantic
account of computation gives rise to pancomputationalism insofar as
the interpretation of those representations is unrestricted. Similar
considerations apply to the syntactic and mechanistic accounts. For
such accounts to avoid unlimited pancomputationalism, they must not
rely on unrestricted interpretation.</p>

<h3><a name="LimPan">3.3 Limited Pancomputationalism</a></h3>

<p>
Limited pancomputationalism is much weaker than its unlimited cousin.
It holds that every physical system performs one (or relatively few)
computations. Which computations are performed by a given system is
deemed to depend on objective properties of that system. In fact,
several authors who have mounted detailed responses to unlimited
pancomputationalism explicitly endorse limited pancomputationalism
(Chalmers 1996, 331, Scheutz 1999, 191).</p>

<p>
Unlike unlimited pancomputationalism, limited pancomputationalism does
not turn the claim that something is computational into a vacuous one.
Different systems generally have different objective properties; thus,
according to limited pancomputationalism, different systems generally
perform different computations. Nevertheless, it may seem that limited
pancomputationalism still trivializes the claim that a system is
computational. For according to limited pancomputationalism, digital
computers perform computations in the same sense in which rocks,
hurricanes, and planetary systems do. This seems at odds with computer
science and engineering, as well as the computational theory of
cognition. If every physical process is a computation, computer
science would have to include every physical process in its domain of
inquiry, and the computational theory of cognition&mdash;which was
motivated in part by the idea that cognition is distinctively
explained by computation&mdash;loses much of its explanatory
force.</p>

<p>
Another objection to limited pancomputationalism begins with the
observation that any moderately complex system satisfies indefinitely
many objective computational descriptions (Piccinini 2010). This may
be seen by considering computational modeling. A computational model
of a system may be constructed at higher or lower resolutions. For
example, cellular automata models of the dynamics of a galaxy or a
brain may be described using different state transition rules,
different time steps, different numbers of states-per-cell that
represent spatial regions of different sizes, etc. Furthermore, an
indefinite number of other formalisms, such as TMs, can be used to
compute the same functions computed by cellular automata. It appears
that limited pancomputationalists are committed to the claim that
galaxies or brains perform all these computations at once. But that
does not appear to be the sense in which computers (or brains) perform
computations.</p>

<p>
In the face of these objections, limited pancomputationalists are
likely to maintain that the explanatory force of computational
explanations does not come from the claim that a system is
computational simpliciter. Rather, explanatory force comes from the
<i>specific</i> computations that a system is said to perform. Thus,
while a rock and a digital computer both perform computations, the
fact that they perform radically different computations explains the
difference between them. As to the objection that there are still too
many computations performed by each system, limited
pancomputationalists have two main options: either to bite the bullet
and accept that every system implements indefinitely many
computations, or to find a way to single out, among the many
computational descriptions satisfied by each system, the one that is
ontologically privileged&mdash;the one that captures <i>the</i>
computation performed by the system. One way to do this is to
postulate a fundamental physical level, whose most accurate
computational description identifies the (most fundamental)
computation performed by the system. This response is built into the
view that the physical world is fundamentally computational (explored
in the next section).</p>

<p>
Those who desire to avoid limited pancomputationalism shift to more
restrictive accounts of computation, analogously to how the desire to
avoid unlimited pancomputationalism motivates the shift from the
simple mapping account to more restrictive accounts of computation,
such as the causal account. The semantic account may be able to
restrict genuine computational descriptions to fewer systems than the
causal account, provided that representations&mdash;which are needed
for computation according to the semantic account&mdash;are hard to
come by. Mutatis mutandis, the same is true of the syntactic and
mechanistic accounts.</p>

<h3><a name="UniComSys">3.4 The Universe as a Computing System</a></h3>

<p>
Some authors argue that the physical universe is fundamentally
computational. The universe itself is a computing system; therefore,
everything in it is a computing system too (or a part thereof). Unlike
the previous versions of pancomputationalism, which originate in
philosophy, this <i>ontic pancomputationalism</i> originates in
physics. It includes both an empirical claim and a metaphysical one.
Although the two claims are logically independent, supporters of ontic
pancomputationalism tend to make them both.</p>

<p>
The empirical claim is that all fundamental physical magnitudes and
their state transitions are such as to be exactly described by an
appropriate computational formalism&mdash;without resorting to the
approximations that are a staple of standard computational modeling.
This claim takes different forms depending on which computational
formalism is taken to describe the universe exactly. The two main
options are cellular automata, which are a classical computational
formalism, and quantum computing, which is non-classical.</p>

<p>
The earliest and best-known version of ontic pancomputationalism is
due to Konrad Zuse (1970, 1982) and Edward Fredkin, whose unpublished
ideas on the subject influenced a number of American physicists (e.g.,
Feynman 1982, Toffoli 1982, Wolfram 2002; see also Wheeler 1982,
Fredkin 1990). According to some of these physicists, the universe
literally is a giant cellular automaton. A cellular automaton is a
lattice of discrete cells; each cell can be in one of finitely many
states, and each cell updates its state in discrete steps depending on
the state of its neighboring cells. For the universe to be a cellular
automaton, all fundamental physical magnitudes must be discrete, i.e.,
they must take at most finitely many values. In addition, time and
space must be fundamentally discrete or must emerge from the discrete
processing of the cellular automaton. At a fundamental level,
continuity is not a real feature of the world&mdash;there are no truly
real-valued physical quantities. This flies in the face of most
mainstream physics, but it is not an obviously false hypothesis. The
hypothesis is that at a sufficiently small scale, which is currently
beyond our observational and experimental reach, (apparent) continuity
gives way to discreteness. Thus, all values of all fundamental
variables, and all state transitions, can be fully and exactly
captured by the states and state transitions of a cellular
automaton.</p>

<p>
Although cellular automata have been shown to describe many aspects of
fundamental physics, it is difficult to see how to simulate the
quantum mechanical features of the universe using a classical
formalism such as cellular automata (Feynman 1982). This concern
motivated the development of quantum computing formalisms (Deutsch
1985, Nielsen and Chuang 2000). Instead of relying on
digits&mdash;most commonly, binary digits or bits&mdash;quantum
computation relies on qudits&mdash;most commonly, binary qudits or
qubits. The main difference between a digit and a qudit is that
whereas a digit can take only one out of finitely many states, such as
0 and 1 (in the case of a bit), a qudit can also take an uncountable
number of states that are a superposition of the basis states in
varying degrees, such as superpositions of 0 and 1 (in the case of a
qubit). Furthermore, unlike a collection of digits, a collection of
qudits can exhibit quantum entanglement. According to the quantum
version of ontic pancomputationalism, the universe is not a classical
computer but a quantum computer&mdash;a computer that manipulates
qubits (Lloyd 2006) or, more generally, qudits.</p>

<p>
The quantum version of ontic pancomputationalism is less radical than
the classical version. The classical version eliminates continuity
from the universe, primarily on the grounds that eliminating
continuity allows classical computers to describe the universe exactly
rather than approximately. Thus, the classical version appears to be
motivated not by empirical evidence but by epistemological concerns.
Although there is no direct evidence for classical ontic
pancomputationalism, in principle it is a testable hypothesis (Fredkin
1990). By contrast, quantum ontic pancomputationalism may be seen as a
reformulation of quantum mechanics in the language of quantum
computation and quantum information theory (qubits), without changes
to the empirical content of the theory (e.g., Fuchs 2004, Bub
2005).</p>

<p>
But ontic pancomputationalists do not limit themselves to making
empirical claims. They often make an additional metaphysical claim.
They claim that computation (or information, in the physical sense
described in Section 2.3) is what makes up the physical universe. This
point is sometimes made by saying that, at the most fundamental
physical level, there are brute differences between
states&mdash;nothing more need or can be said about the nature of the
states. This view reverses the traditional conception of the relation
between computation and the physical world.</p>

<p>
According to the traditional conception, which is presupposed by all
accounts of computation discussed above, physical computation requires
a physical medium, or substrate. Computation is an aspect of the
organization and behavior of a physical system; there is no software
without hardware. Thus, according to the traditional conception, if
the universe is a cellular automaton, the ultimate constituents of the
universe are the physical cells of the cellular automaton. It is
legitimate to ask what kind of physical entity such cells are and how
they interact with one another so as to satisfy their cellular
automata rules.</p>

<p>
By contrast, according to the metaphysical claim of ontic
pancomputationalism, a physical system is just a system of
computational states. Computation is ontologically prior to physical
processes, as it were. &ldquo;&lsquo;Hardware&rsquo; [is] made of
&lsquo;software&rsquo;&rdquo; (Kantor 1982, 526, 534), or
&ldquo;it&rdquo; (the physical) comes from &ldquo;bit&rdquo; (the
computational) (Wheeler 1989). According to this non-traditional
conception, if the universe is a cellular automaton, the cells of the
automaton are not concrete, physical structures that causally interact
with one another. Rather, they are software&mdash;purely
&ldquo;computational&rdquo; entities.</p>

<p>
Such a metaphysical claim requires an account of what computation, or
software, or physical information, is. If computations are not
configurations of physical entities, the most obvious alternative is
that computations are abstract, mathematical entities, like numbers
and sets. As Wheeler (1982, 570) puts it, &ldquo;the building element
[of the universe] is the elementary &lsquo;yes, no&rsquo; quantum
phenomenon. It is an abstract entity. It is not localized in space and
time&rdquo;. Under this account of computation, the ontological claim
of ontic pancomputationalism is a version of Pythagoreanism. All is
computation in the same sense in which more traditional versions of
Pythagoreanism maintain that all is number or that all is sets (Quine
1976).</p>

<p>
Ontic pancomputationalism may be questioned on both the empirical and
the ontological fronts. On the empirical front, there is little
positive evidence to support ontic pancomputationalism. Supporters
appear to be motivated by the desire for exact computational models of
the world rather than empirical evidence that the models are correct.
Even someone who shares this desire may well question why we should
expect nature to fulfill it. On the metaphysical front, Pythagoreanism
faces the objection that the abstract entities it puts at the
fundamental physical level lack the causal and qualitative properties
that we observe in the physical world&mdash;or at least, it is
difficult to understand how abstract entities could give rise to
physical qualities and their causal powers (e.g., Martin 1997).</p>

<h2><a name="PhyCom">4. Physical Computability</a></h2>

<p>
According to the Church-Turing thesis (CTT), any function that is
intuitively computable is computable by some TM (i.e.,
Turing-computable). Alternatively, CTT may be formulated as the thesis
that any function &ldquo;naturally regarded as computable&rdquo;
(Turing 1936&ndash;7, 135) is Turing-computable. The phrases
&ldquo;intuitively computable&rdquo; and &ldquo;naturally regarded as
computable&rdquo; are somewhat ambiguous. When they are disambiguated,
CTT takes different forms.</p>

<p>
In one sense, &ldquo;intuitively computable&rdquo; means computable by
following an algorithm or effective procedure. An effective procedure
is a finite list of clear instructions for generating new symbolic
structures out of old symbolic structures; an example would be
dividing two numbers according to the long division algorithm, using
only paper and pencil. When CTT is interpreted in terms of effective
procedures, it may be called <i>Mathematical CTT</i>, because the
relevant evidence is more logical or mathematical than physical.
Mathematical CTT says that any function <i>computable by an effective
procedure</i> is Turing-computable.</p>

<p>
There is compelling evidence for Mathematical CTT (Kleene 1952,
&sect;62, &sect;67; cf. also Sieg 2006):</p>

<ul>

<li>There are no known counterexamples.</li>

<li>Diagonalization over Turing machines, contrary to what may be
expected, does not yield a function that is not
Turing-computable.</li>

<li>The argument from confluence: all the formalisms proposed to
capture the intuitive notion of computability by effective
procedure&mdash;formalisms such as general recursiveness (G&ouml;del
1934), &lambda;-definability (Church 1932, Kleene 1935),
Turing-computability (Turing 1936-7), and reckonability (G&ouml;del
1936)&mdash;turn out to capture the same class of functions.</li>

<li>A Turing machine seems capable of reproducing any operation that a
human being can perform while following an effective procedure (Turing
1936&ndash;7&rsquo;s main argument for CTT).</li>
</ul>

<p>
In another sense, &ldquo;intuitively computable&rdquo; means
computable by physical means. When CTT is so interpreted, it may be
called <em>Physical CTT</em> (following Pitowsky 1990), because the
relevant evidence is more physical than logical or mathematical.</p>

<h3><a name="PhyChuTurTheBol">4.1 The Physical Church-Turing Thesis: Bold</a></h3>

<p>
Physical CTT is often formulated in very strong forms. To a first
approximation, <i>Bold Physical CTT</i> holds that any physical
process&mdash;anything <i>doable</i> by a physical system&mdash;is
computable by some TM.</p>

<p>
Bold Physical CTT can be made more precise in a number of ways. Here
is a representative sample, followed by references to where they are
discussed:</p>

<ol>

<li>Any physical process can be simulated by some TM (e.g., Deutsch
1985, Wolfram 1985, Pitowsky 2002).</li>

<li>If a physical system can be modeled by a certain kind of idealized
computing machine that manipulates real-valued quantities, then that
physical system can only compute Turing-computable functions on
denumerable domains (Blum et al. 1989 show this to be false).</li>

<li>Any system of equations describing a physical system gives rise to
computable solutions (cf. Earman 1986, Pour-El 1999). A solution is
said to be computable just in case, given computable real numbers as
initial conditions, it returns computable real numbers as values
(where, following Turing, a real number is said to be computable just
in case there is a TM whose output produces any desired number of
digits of that number).</li>

<li>For any physical system S and observable W, there is a
Turing-computable function <em>f</em>: <strong><em>N</em></strong>
&rarr; <strong><em>N</em></strong> such that for all times <em>t</em>
&isin; N, <em>f</em>(<em>t</em>) = W(<em>t</em>) (Pitowsky 1990).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Thesis (A) is ambiguous between two notions of simulation. In one
sense, simulation is the process by which a digital computing system
(such as a TM) computes the same function as another digital computing
system. This is the sense in which universal TMs can simulate any
other TM. If (A) is interpreted using this first notion of simulation,
it entails that everything in the universe is a digital computing
system. This is (a variant of) ontic pancomputationalism (Section
3.4).</p>

<p>
In another sense, simulation is the process by which the output of a
digital computing system represents an approximate description of the
dynamical evolution of another system. This is the sense in which
computational models of the weather simulate the weather. If (A) is
interpreted using this second notion of simulation, then (A) is true
only if we do not care how close our computational approximations are.
If we want close computational approximations&mdash;as we usually
do&mdash;then (A) turns into the claim that any physical process can
be computationally approximated to the degree of accuracy that is
desired in any given case. Whether that is true varies from case to
case depending on the dynamical properties of the system, how much is
known about them, what idealizations and simplifications are adopted
in the model, what numerical methods are used in the computation, and
how many computational resources (such as time, processing speed, and
memory) are available (Piccinini 2015, Chap 4).</p>

<p>
Thesis (B) is straightforwardly and radically false, as shown by Blum
<i>et al</i>. (1989). Blum <i>et al</i>. set up a mathematical theory
of computation over real-valued quantities, which they see as a
fruitful extension of ordinary computability theory. Within such a
theory, they define idealized &ldquo;computing&rdquo; machines that
perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and equality
testing as primitive operations on arbitrary real-valued quantities.
They easily prove that such machines can compute all sets defined over
denumerable domains by encoding their characteristic function as a
real-valued constant (ibid., 405). Although they do not discuss this
result as a refutation of Physical CTT, their work is often cited in
discussions of physical computability and Physical CTT.</p>

<p>
Theses (C) and (D) have interesting counterexamples that are
consistent with some physical theories (cf. below and Pour-El 1999).
These theoretical counterexamples may or may not occur in our concrete
physical universe.</p>

<p>
Each of (A)&ndash;(D) raises important questions pertaining to the
foundations of computer science, physics, and mathematics. It is not
clear, however, that any of these theses bears an interesting analogy
to Mathematical CTT. Below are two reasons why.</p>

<p>
First, (A)&ndash;(D) are falsified by processes that cannot be built
and used as computing devices. The most obvious example is (B). Blum
<i>et al</i>.&rsquo;s result is equivalent to demonstrating that all
functions over denumerable domains&mdash;including the uncountably
many functions that are not Turing-computable&mdash;are computable by
Blum <i>et al</i>.&rsquo;s &ldquo;computing&rdquo; systems, which are
allowed to manipulate the exact values of arbitrary real numbers.
Hence, (B) is radically false. But at the same time, this result has
no direct practical applications, as there is no evidence that
concrete physical systems can manipulate arbitrary real-valued
quantities in the way that Blum <i>et al</i>.&rsquo;s systems do.</p>

<p>
More generally, formulations (A)&ndash;(D) would be falsified by a
sequence generated by a random (i.e., nondeterministic) physical
process. According to quantum mechanics, some physical
processes&mdash;such as atom decay&mdash;contain an objectively random
element. Hidden variable interpretations dispute this, but the
possibility of genuine randomness is sufficiently plausible that it
should be taken into account.</p>

<p>
Consider a random process that produces discrete outputs over an
infinite period of time, e.g., the decay of atoms from a radioactive
sample. Its output at regular time intervals is a string of
digits&mdash;&lsquo;0&rsquo; if no atoms decay during a time interval,
&lsquo;1&rsquo; if one or more atoms decay during a time interval. A
simple consideration shows that, with probability one, the sequence
produced by our random process is not Turing-computable. There are
uncountably many infinite strings of digits (even more strongly, there
are uncountably many infinite strings of digits with any given
limiting frequency of &lsquo;0&rsquo;s and &lsquo;1&rsquo;s). But there are only
countably many Turing-computable infinite strings. Therefore, assuming
that each infinite string has the same probability of occurring as a
result of a random process, the probability that a random process
would generate a Turing-computable string of digits is zero, whereas
the probability that the string of digits is not Turing-computable is
one (for the stronger conclusion that no such string of digits is
Turing-computable, see Calude &amp; Svozil 2008). Thus, simply by
using a truly random process to generate a string, we would have the
physical means to go beyond what is Turing-computable. As Turing
(1950, 438&ndash;439) pointed out, a machine with a &ldquo;random
element&rdquo; can do &ldquo;more&rdquo; than a TM. But <i>doing</i>
more is not the same as <i>computing</i> more. Contrary to what is
sometimes suggested (e.g., Calude 2005, 10), the combination of a TM
and a random process does not threaten Physical CTT.</p>

<p>
Random processes should <i>not</i> count as computations: unlike
computations properly so called, the values of random processes
cannot, by definition, be the output of a function. Random processes
can be <i>exploited</i> by a computation, of course&mdash;there are
important computational techniques that rely on random or
pseudo-random choices at some stages of a computation. If some quantum
random sequences were random in the sense of algorithmic information
theory, they may even raise the probability of obtaining correct
solutions from computational techniques that rely on random choices
(Calude 2005, 10). But no computational technique can amount to a mere
sequence of random choices. So, any thesis, such as Bold Physical CTT,
that would be falsified by a sequence generated by a random process is
too strong to capture the notion of <i>physical</i>
computability&mdash;the physical analogue of algorithmic
computability. Thus, contrary to what some authors seem to assume,
Bold Physical CTT is too strong to be a physical analogue of
Mathematical CTT.</p>

<p>
Another feature that theses (A)&ndash;(D) have in common is that they
appeal quite freely to arbitrary real-valued quantities. This is
explicit in (B). To see why they all appeal to arbitrary real-valued
quantities, consider that most physical theories assume that many
physical magnitudes, including time, can take arbitrary real numbers
as values. Hence, systems of physical equations, whose simulations,
solutions, or observables are appealed to, respectively, by (A), (C),
and (D), involve arbitrary real numbers. Therefore, all formulations
of Bold Physical CTT involve, explicitly or implicitly, arbitrary real
numbers.</p>

<p>
The expressive power of real numbers may be used to generate a simple
recipe to obtain the values of a Turing-uncomputable function.
Consider that the digital expansion of a real number contains
countably many digits. Hence, for any characteristic function (i.e., a
function whose values are &lsquo;0&rsquo; or &lsquo;1&rsquo;) defined
over a countable domain, including all Turing-uncomputable such
functions, there is a real number whose binary expansion encodes its
values. This is because for all values of a characteristic function,
the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> value of the function may be defined to be
the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> digit of the binary expansion of a real
number.</p>

<p>
Suppose you wish to know the value of a specific Turing-uncomputable
characteristic function, such as the halting function for TMs, for its
<i>n</i><sup>th</sup> argument. Take the real number <i>r</i> whose
digital expansion encodes the values of the halting function. Then,
obtain the value of the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> digit in the binary
expansion of <i>r</i> and you have the result you desire. If you can
do this, you may obtain any value of any characteristic function
defined over strings, including all Turing-uncomputable such
functions.</p>

<p>
The above recipe, if feasible, is a trivial consequence of the
expressive power of real numbers. Yet it is discussed in the
literature as an example of perhaps possible physical computation
beyond the power of TMs (e.g., Copeland 2000)&mdash;something that
would falsify Physical CTT. There is no reason to believe such a
recipe can be implemented, because it requires either the measurement
or the preparation of a Turing-uncomputable real-valued quantities
with unbounded precision. There is no evidence that either is
doable.</p>

<p>
By relying quite freely on arbitrary real-valued quantities, many
versions of Bold Physical CTT make themselves vulnerable to
falsification by relatively trivial (though presumably unfeasible)
recipes such as the one just mentioned. This casts doubt on the
assumption&mdash;made by some who seek ways to falsify Bold Physical
CTT&mdash;that Bold Physical CTT is actually an interesting physical
analogue of Mathematical CTT.</p>

<p>
(The point just made does not impugn analog computation in the
standard sense of Pour-El (1974). Analog computation does <i>not</i>
manipulate exact values of arbitrary real-valued quantities but rather
continuous <i>variables</i>. Although the continuous variables used in
most analog computations may be assumed to take any real value within
a relevant interval, concrete analog computation requires only the
manipulation and measurement of real variables within <i>some</i>
degree of approximation. So, analog computation does not falsify Bold
Physical CTT (cf. Rubel 1989).)</p>

<p>
Similar doubts about the alleged analogy between Mathematical CTT and
Bold Physical CTT may be generated by a related observation. Many
current physical theories assume that nature contains real-valued
quantities that vary along a continuum. These may include the velocity
of objects, the coordinates that define the position of their center
of gravity in the spacetime manifold, and more. If these physical
theories are correct, then many properties of many entities take
arbitrary real numbers as their values. And most real numbers in any
continuous interval are Turing-uncomputable (i.e. there are only
countably many computable numbers, but any continuous interval
contains uncountably many real numbers). Thus, the probability is zero
that an arbitrary real-valued quantity is computable. Hence, if our
physical theories are correct, most transformations of the relevant
physical properties are transformations of Turing-uncomputable
quantities into one another.</p>

<p>
For instance, an object&rsquo;s change of speed, or even its simple change
of spatial location, may be transformations of one Turing-uncomputable
real-valued quantity into another. A transformation of one
Turing-uncomputable value into another Turing-uncomputable value is a
Turing-uncomputable operation&mdash;if nothing else, because no TM can
write down the input and output of such an operation. On this picture,
the physical world is chock-full of operations that outstrip the power
of TMs, thus Bold Physical CTT is falsified.</p>

<p>
There is no reason to believe that we can use the Turing-uncomputable
operations just mentioned to <i>compute</i> in the epistemological
sense that motivates our interest in computation in the first
place&mdash;to solve problems, to generate the values of desired
functions for desired arguments, to understand certain physical
systems, and so on. In other words, the operations in question should
not count as computations. Bold Physical CTT, which is threatened by
such operations, is not interestingly analogous to Mathematical
CTT.</p>

<p>
To conclude our discussion of Bold Physical CTT, it may be helpful to
distinguish the issue of physical computability proper&mdash;the issue
that pertains to the physical analogue of Mathematical CTT&mdash;from
other issues that connect computability and physics. Many questions
about the relationship between physical processes and computability
deserve to be asked. What are the physically computable functions?
This is the question that should motivate Physical CTT. What can be
computationally approximated to what degree under what circumstances?
This is presumably what (A) is after. As important and interesting as
this question is, it is different from the question of what can be
physically computed. Yet other questions motivate theses (B)-(D) above
as well as other versions of Bold Physical CTT to be found in the
literature. Many of these questions are interesting and deserve to be
investigated. Nevertheless, they do not properly belong in discussions
of CTT, because they are different from the computability question
that motivates CTT in the first place.</p>

<h3><a name="PhyChuTurTheMod">4.2 The Physical Church-Turing Thesis: Modest</a></h3>

<p>
In the literature on computation in physical systems, there is growing
concern that a physical analogue of Mathematical CTT should include
only <i>usable</i> physical processes (e.g., N&eacute;meti and
D&aacute;vid 2006; Ord 2006, Smith 2006a, Beggs and Tucker 2007).
Given this concern, an adequate version of Physical CTT ought to be
more modest than Bold Physical CTT.</p>

<p>
Modest Physical CTT is thus formulated in terms of what can be
physically computed&mdash;more precisely, which functions over a
denumerable domain can be physically computed. Prototypical examples
of physical computation are the processes of ordinary digital
computers and their components, including digital circuits. These
processes can be exhaustively described by effective procedures, which
are already covered by Mathematical CTT, plus relatively
uncontroversial mappings between physical states and computational
states. Mathematical CTT says that any function computable by an
effective procedure is computable by a TM. As TMs can be physically
implemented (or replaced by a computing human), any process that
follows an effective procedure is physically computable.</p>

<p>
But physical computation in the present sense is a broader notion than
computation by effective procedure. A process may count as a physical
computation even if there is no effective procedure for describing the
process, perhaps because there are no finite instantaneous
descriptions of the internal states that constitute the process or no
way to finitely and exactly specify the transition from one
instantaneous description to the next. Thus, Modest Physical CTT is
stronger than Mathematical CTT.</p>

<p>
Gandy (1980) was one of the first to discuss a version of Modest
Physical CTT, arguing that mechanisms with discrete components and
reasonable physical limitations (a lower bound on the size of
components, and an upper bound on the speed of their kinematics) can
only physically compute Turing-computable functions. However, Modest
Physical CTT need not be limited in these ways. In addition to
physical processes that follow effective procedures, Modest Physical
CTT may cover continuous dynamical processes (as in certain kinds of
neural networks), processes that span large portions of spacetime, and
quantum processes (as in quantum computing). But physical computation
does not include <i>all</i> physical processes.</p>

<p>
In accordance with this proposal, <i>Modest Physical CTT</i> holds
that any function (of a denumerable domain) that is <i>physically</i>
<i>computable</i> is Turing-computable.</p>

<p>
For a process to count as a physical computation, and hence for it to
be relevant to Modest Physical CTT, it must be usable by an observer
to generate the desired values of an independently specified function.
This requirement may be spelled out in terms of a number of
constraints (Piccinini 2015, Chaps 15 and 16). This list is not
intended to be exhaustive:</p>

<ol>

<li>Readable inputs and outputs. The process must take inputs and
yield outputs that observers can read without error, so that observers
can use the outputs as solutions to problems or values of functions
defined over the inputs. For that to be possible, presumably the
inputs and outputs need to be reducible to strings of discrete states,
like the inputs and outputs of ordinary digital computers.</li>

<li>Process-independent rule. There must be a fixed rule or
map&mdash;specifiable independently of the physical process&mdash;that
links the outputs to the inputs. By defining the problem to be solved
by the process, this rule tells the user what she is going to learn by
running the process. Since the rule defines a physical computation in
general, the rule need not be recursive. For instance, it may be the
rule that defines the halting problem for TMs. But like all recursive
rules, the rule must be the same for all inputs that belong in the
same problem; it cannot change from one input to the next.</li>

<li>Repeatability. The process must be repeatable, at least in
principle, so as to allow users to obtain the same results multiple
times and to check a computation by repeating it.</li>

<li>Settability. The system undergoing the process must be settable,
so that a user can choose which argument of a function the system
computes and set the system to compute the relevant value of the
function.</li>

<li>Physical constructibility. The system must be physically
constructible.</li>

<li>Reliability. The system must not break down before the process is
completed.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In summary, Modest Physical CTT asserts that every function that can
be physically computed, i.e., every usable transformation of input
strings into output strings in accordance with a process-independent
rule defined over the strings, is Turing-computable.</p>

<p>
Since Modest Physical CTT is restricted by epistemologically relevant
criteria, it doesn&rsquo;t raise the worries associated with Bold Physical
CTT&mdash;namely, that it&rsquo;s too easy to falsify and irrelevant to the
notion of computability that motivates CTT. And there are good reasons
to believe Modest Physical CTT. All computing mechanisms that have
been physically built or are in the process of being built to compute
functions of a denumerable domain compute only functions that are
Turing-computable.</p>

<p>
It is important to understand the exact scope of Modest Physical CTT.
Modest Physical CTT does not entail that every physical process is a
computation, or that every physical system is a computing system. It
only says that if something physical computes functions of a
denumerable domain, then the functions it computes are
Turing-computable.</p>

<p>
To fully assess Modest Physical CTT, we should consider whether it is
possible to build a machine that, like an ordinary digital computer,
can be used by human observers, but, unlike an ordinary digital
computer, generates the values of functions that are
Turing-uncomputable. In recent years, several designs for
hypercomputation have been proposed. Hypercomputation is the
computation of Turing-uncomputable functions. If hypercomputation
turned out to be physically possible, it would refute Modest Physical
CTT.</p>

<h3><a name="Hyp">4.3 Hypercomputation</a></h3>

<p>
To a first approximation, a hypercomputer is a system that yields the
values of a function that is not Turing-computable. If what counts as
yielding the values of a function is left unspecified, any of the
systems discussed in Section 4.1, such as genuinely random processes
and systems that manipulate arbitrary real-valued quantities, would
count as hypercomputers. But in discussing Bold Physical CTT, we saw
that yielding the values of a function that is Turing-uncomputable,
without further constraints, is not enough for genuine physical
computation.</p>

<p>
By analogy with the distinction between Bold Physical CTT and Modest
Physical CTT, let us distinguish between a weak and a strong notion of
hypercomputation by distinguishing usable hypercomputers from unusable
hypercomputational processes.</p>

<p>
An <i>unusable</i> hypercomputational process is a physical process
that fails to satisfy at least one of the first four constraints on
physical computation. Examples include processes whose inputs or
outputs are arbitrary real-valued quantities (which cannot be read
with infinite precision) and genuine random processes (which have no
rule characterizing the inputs and outputs independently of the
process and are neither repeatable nor settable). These processes are
not usable because an observer cannot obtain from them arbitrary
values of an independently defined function on a chosen input, as
ordinary computing systems can (given enough time and space). Since
they are not usable, unusable hypercomputational processes are
irrelevant to Modest Physical CTT.</p>

<p>
A <i>usable</i> hypercomputer is a physical system that satisfies at
least the first four constraints on physical computation. It has
readable inputs and outputs, there is a rule characterizing its
input-output properties that may be defined independently of the
process itself, and its processes are repeatable and settable. If a
system does not satisfy one of these conditions, it does not count as
computing in the sense relevant to Modest Physical CTT.</p>

<p>
A system that satisfies these conditions&mdash;a usable
hypercomputer&mdash;may be purely notional. For instance, infinitely
accelerating TMs (Copeland 2002) are TMs that perform each
computational operation in half the time as their previous operation.
As a consequence, infinitely accelerating TMs complete an infinite
number of operations (a <i>supertask</i>) within twice the time it
takes them to perform their first operation. This allows infinitely
accelerating TMs to compute functions, such as the halting function,
that are Turing-uncomputable. But infinitely accelerating TMs are
usually discussed as notional entities, without evidence that they can
be constructed. Purely notional systems, of course, do not falsify
Modest Physical CTT. To do that, a system must satisfy at least the
fifth and sixth constraints on physical computation: it must be
physically constructible, and it must operate reliably.</p>

<p>
One way to construct something like an infinitely accelerating TM
would be to make a computing machine that, after performing some
computational operations, builds a smaller and faster copy of itself
(Davies 2001). The smaller and faster copy will also perform some
operations and then build a faster and smaller copy, and so on. Given
appropriate assumptions, the resulting series of infinitely shrinking
machines will be able to complete an infinite number of computational
operations within a finite time, thereby surpassing the power of TMs.
While infinitely shrinking machines appear to be consistent with
Newtonian mechanics, Davies (2001, 672) points out that the atomic and
quantum mechanical nature of matter in our universe makes infinitely
shrinking machines physically impossible.</p>

<p>
Neural networks have sometimes been discussed as computing systems
that may go beyond Turing-computability (e.g., Smolensky 1988). If we
restrict our attention to classes of neural networks that contain all
systems with current or foreseeable practical applications, this
opinion is unwarranted. There is now a considerable literature on the
computational and complexity properties of large classes of neural
networks. The most relevant systems have digital inputs and outputs
(so as to satisfy our first constraint on physical computation) but
may have, and typically do have, non-digital internal processes (i.e.,
their internal processes are not discrete step-by-step manipulations
of strings of digits). The main results are the following: (i)
feedforward networks with finitely many processing units are
computationally equivalent to Boolean circuits with finitely many
gates; (ii) recurrent networks with finitely many units are equivalent
to finite state automata; (iii) networks with unbounded tapes or an
unbounded number of units are equivalent to TMs (&Scaron;&iacute;ma
&amp; Orponen 2003).</p>

<p>
Neural networks more powerful than TMs may be defined, however, by
exploiting once again the expressive power of real numbers. The best
known networks of this kind are Analog Recurrent Neural Networks
(ARNNs) (Siegelmann 1999). ARNNs should not be confused with analog
computers in the traditional sense (Pour-El 1974, Rubel 1993, Mills
2008). Whereas analog computers manipulate real variables without
relying on the exact value of arbitrary real-valued quantities, ARNNs
manipulate strings of digits by (possibly) relying on the exact value
of arbitrary real-valued quantities. Specifically, the weights
connecting individual processing units within ARNNs can take exact
values of arbitrary real numbers, including values that are
Turing-uncomputable, and such exact values are exploited in the
computation. When their weights are Turing-uncomputable, ARNNs can go
beyond the power of Turing-machines: they compute any function over
binary strings. ARNNs more powerful than TMs cannot operated reliably,
because they require unboundedly precise weights. In addition, the
required weights are Turing-uncomputable, so constructing ARRNs more
powerful than TMs requires already possessing the ability to perform
hypercomputations (Davis 2004, Schonbein 2005, Siegelmann 1999,
148).</p>

<p>
Perhaps the best-known proposal for a hypercomputer is due to Mark
Hogarth (1994, 2004), who developed an idea of Itamar Pitowsky (1990).
Relativistic hypercomputers exploit the properties of a special kind
of spacetime called Malament-Hogarth spacetime, which is physically
possible in the sense of constituting a solution to Einstein&rsquo;s field
equations for General Relativity. Malament-Hogarth spacetimes contain
regions with an infinite time-like trajectory &lambda; that can be
circumvented by a finite time-like trajectory &gamma;. In other words,
&lambda; and &gamma; have a common origin, and there is a spacetime
point <i>p</i> on &gamma; such that &lambda;, even though it is
infinite, lies entirely in <i>p</i>&rsquo;s chronological past. If an
observer launches a TM along &lambda; and then travels along &gamma;
she may, within finite time, find herself in the future of an
infinitely long computation performed by the TM. If the TM is able to
send signals to the observer, the observer would be able to know the
outcome of a potentially infinitely long computation, thereby having
computational means more powerful than (ordinary) TMs. For instance,
an observer may be able to obtain the results of an arbitrary instance
of the halting function for TMs.</p>

<p>
Constructing and using a relativistic hypercomputer is challenging.
The first question is whether our spacetime is Malament-Hogarth. The
answer is currently unknown. Even if our spacetime is not
Malament-Hogarth globally, it might still contain regions that have
the Malament-Hogarth property locally. An example of such a region is
a huge, rotating black hole; there is evidence that our universe
contains such black holes (Etesi and N&eacute;meti 2002). But even if
there are Malament-Hogarth regions in our universe, there remain
considerable obstacles. For starters, (i) the huge, rotating black
hole that is closest to us is probably out of our reach as well as our
descendants&rsquo; reach, (ii) completing an infinite computation requires
an unbounded memory, which might require an unbounded amount of
matter, and (iii) a machine that requires an unbounded amount of
matter running for an infinite amount of time will malfunction with
probability 1, rendering it useless (Button, 2009, 779). The latter
challenge might be addressable by employing multiple self-reproducing
and self-correcting machines that check one another&rsquo;s
computations instead of a single machine (Andr&eacute;ka et al. 2018),
although that seems to exacerbate the need for unbounded resources
(see also N&eacute;meti and D&aacute;vid 2006, Andr&eacute;ka,
N&eacute;meti, and N&eacute;meti 2009).</p>

<p>
Quantum computing has also been invoked as a possible source of
hypercomputation. Quantum computing is the manipulation of qubits (and
more generally, qudits) in accordance with the laws of quantum
mechanics. Qubits are variables that, like bits, can be prepared or
measured in one or two states, 0 and 1. Unlike bits, qubits can (i)
take states that are a superposition of 0 and 1 and (ii) become
entangled with each other during a computation. A surprising feature
of quantum computing is that it allows computing certain functions
much faster than any known classical computation (Shor 1994). But
while mainstream quantum computing may be more efficient than
classical computing, it does not allow computing any functions beyond
those computable by TMs.</p>

<p>
Some authors have questioned whether the mainstream quantum computing
paradigm is general enough and, if not, whether some aspects of
quantum mechanics may be exploited to design a quantum hypercomputer
(Nielsen 1997, Calude and Pavlov 2002). The most prominent proposal
for a quantum hypercomputer is due to Tien Kieu (2002, 2003, 2004,
2005). He argues that an appropriately constructed quantum system can
decide whether an arbitrary Diophantine equation has an integral
solution&mdash;a problem which is known to be unsolvable by TMs.
Kieu&rsquo;s method involves encoding a specific instance of the problem in
an appropriate Hamiltonian, which represents the total energy of a
quantum system. Kieu shows that such a system can dynamically evolve
over time into an energy ground state that encodes the desired
solution. Unfortunately, Kieu&rsquo;s scheme does not appear to be workable.
For one thing, it requires infinite precision in setting up and
maintaining the system (Hodges 2005). For another, Kieu does not
provide a successful criterion for knowing <i>when</i> the system has
evolved into the solution state, and the problem of determining when
the solution state is reached is Turing-uncomputable (Smith 2006b,
Hagar and Korolev 2007). Thus, operating Kieu&rsquo;s proposed hypercomputer
would require already possessing hypercomputational powers.</p>

<p>
In conclusion, the candidate hypercomputers proposed so far have not
been shown to be physically constructible and reliable. For the time
being, Modest Physical CTT remains plausible. It may well be that, for
all practical purposes, any function that is physically computable is
Turing-computable.</p>

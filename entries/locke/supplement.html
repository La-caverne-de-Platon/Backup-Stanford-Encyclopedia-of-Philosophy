<h2>Some issues in Locke&rsquo;s Philosophy of Mind</h2>

<p>
In this supplement, we consider some of the most interesting and
controversial claims that Locke makes in the Philosophy of Mind. The
two most important of these are Locke&rsquo;s remarks in Book IV,
Chapter 3 section 6 of <em>An Essay Concerning Human
Understanding</em> that for all we know God could just as easily make
matter fitly disposed to think as He could add thought to an
immaterial substance; the second is the revolutionary theory of
personal identity that Locke added in Chapter 27 of Book II of the
second edition of the <em>Essay</em>. These claims and suggestions,
along with a number of others, turn out to be connected in interesting
ways and raise important questions about the degree to which Locke is
willing to endorse substance dualism and the extent of his commitment
to Boylean mechanism.</p>

<h3 id="ThinMattImmaSoulImmo">Thinking Matter, Immateriality of the Soul and Immortality</h3>

<p>
In giving us his estimate of the limits of human understanding, Locke
made some claims which surprised his contemporaries. In IV.3.6 he
suggests that given our ignorance of substances, it was possible that
God could make matter fitly disposed think. He writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We have the <em>Ideas</em> of <em>Matter</em> and of
<em>Thinking,</em> but possibly shall never be able to know, whether
any material being thinks, or no; it being impossible for us, by the
contemplation of our own <em>Ideas,</em> without revelation, to
discover whether Omnipotency has not given to some System of Matter
fitly disposed, a power to perceive and think, or else joined to
matter so disposed, a thinking immaterial substance. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In Book IV of the <em>Essay</em> Locke makes a distinction between
what we can know and propositions that are only probable. In the
passage quoted above he is telling us that we may never be able to
know whether dualist or materialist theories of mind are true. If we
can&rsquo;t know which position is true, that would seem to be the end
of it. But, in fact, even though we may never know which is true, this
leaves entirely open the question of which view is more plausible or
probable.</p>

<p>
In his recent book, <em>Locke&rsquo;s Touchy Subjects</em> (2015)
Nicholas Jolley argues that a variety of different passages in <em>An
Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em> and other works, including
his Correspondence with Bishop Stillingfleet suggest that Locke is
trying to show that a weak form of materialism is a plausible
candidate in the Philosophy of Mind (Jolley 2015: 8). What Jolley has
in mind is form of materialism that is compatible with a dualism of
properties (Jolley 2015: 11&ndash;12). Locke&rsquo; motivations are
theological as much as metaphysical. Jolley claims that as a
theologian Locke deals with with issues in both natural, and perhaps
more surprisingly, revealed religion. In Jolley&rsquo;s view
Locke&rsquo;s weak form of materialism is an important piece in a
theological reconciling project. Let us return to Locke&rsquo;s
remarks about thinking matter to see how this might be so.</p>

<p>
In the passage from Book IV quoted above, Locke is telling us that
both possibilities, thinking matter and immaterial thinking substance,
are beyond our comprehension and require in either case God to add
the powers of perception and thought to matter or to the immaterial
substance&mdash;which is then joined to the fitly disposed matter.</p>

<p>
The thinking matter hypothesis disturbed a number of Locke&rsquo;s
early critics (and some later ones). In his proof for the existence of
God in Book IV of the <em>Essay</em> Locke had adopted a conclusion of
an argument substance dualists used to defend dualism, namely:
&ldquo;For it is impossible to conceive, that ever bare incognitive
Matter, should produce a thinking intelligent Being, as that Nothing
of itself produces Matter&rdquo; (IV.10.9 10&ndash;13, N: 623). This
is because, as the dualist claimed, from motion all you get is motion,
from figure only other figures. (Let us call this the Homogeneity
Principle.) Since perception and thought are not motions or figures,
they cannot be caused by matter. It appeared to some of his critics
that this conclusion, which Locke uses to show that there must be some
eternal immaterial cognitive Being (namely God), would also rule out
Locke&rsquo;s thinking matter hypothesis. Indeed, it would seem that
his suggestion in IV.3.6 and his adoption of the principle in IV.10.9
amount to a contradiction. Locke, however, explicitly denies this. In
another part of the discussion of thinking matter, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For I see no contradiction in it, that the first Eternal Thinking
Being, should, if he pleased, give to certain systems of created,
senseless matter, put together as he thinks fit, some degree of sense,
perception and thought: Though I think as I have proved, Lib IV c.10th
it is no less than a contradiction to suppose matter (which is in its own
nature void of sense and thought) should be that eternal first
thinking Being. What Certainty of knowledge can anyone have that some
perceptions, such as v.g. pleasure and pain, should not be in some
bodies themselves, after a certain manner modified and moved, as well
as they should be in an immaterial Substance, upon the motion of the
parts of the Body: Body as far as we can conceive being only able to
strike and affect body; and Motion according to the utmost reach of
our <em>Ideas</em>, being able to produce nothing but Motion, so that
when we allow it to produce pleasure or pain, or the <em>Ideas of
Colour</em>, or Sound, we are fain to quit our Reason, go beyond our
<em>Ideas</em> and attribute it wholly to the good pleasure of our
Maker. For since we must allow that he has annexed Effects to Motion,
which we can no way conceive Motion able to produce, what reason have
we to conclude, that he could not order them as well as to be produced
in a Subject we cannot conceive capable of them, as well as in a
Subject we cannot conceive the motion of Matter can any way operate
upon? (IV.3.6, N: 18&ndash;30) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke claims that it was no farther beyond our comprehension that
motions of the body could give rise to pleasure and pain, colors and
sounds, than that an immaterial soul could feel pain or see colors
after the occurrence of some motions in the body. Plainly, he is using
the mind body problem to suggest that their are features of substance
dualism that are just as puzzling as the fact that the standard
corpuscularian mechanism cannot explain thinking matter. Locke is
putting the dualist and materialist positions on the same footing. He
immediately draws the theological conclusion that follows from the two
hypotheses being equally plausible:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
All the great ends of Morality and Religion, are well enough secured
without the philosophical Proofs of the Soul&rsquo;s Immateriality;
since it is evident that he who, at first made us beings to subsist
here, sensible intelligent Beings, and for several years continued us
in such a state, can and will restore us to a like state of
Sensibility in another World, and make us there capable to receive the
Retribution he has designed to men, according to the doings in this
life. And therefore tis not a mighty necessity to determine one way or
t&rsquo;other, as some overzealous for or against the Immateriality of
the Soul, have been foreward to make the World believe. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this passage about the great ends of morality and religion Locke is
claiming that the issue of whether the soul is material or immaterial
is of no great importance for morality or the ends of religion. There
will be a resurrection of the dead, judgment and just rewards and
punishments will be meted out, whether the thing that thinks in us is
material or immaterial. By showing that on either account the ends and
purposes of morality and religion will be served, Locke is reconciling
the contestants on either side by showing that what is at stake will
be gained either way. So the fierce contention over the immateriality
of the soul can be set aside because it doesn&rsquo;t matter.
God&rsquo;s Omnipotence resolves the need for this debate. This is, I
take it what Jolley has in mind by Locke&rsquo;s &ldquo;reconciling
strategy&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="Supe">Superaddition</h3>

<p>
What is it that God adds (or in Locke&rsquo;s technical language)
superadds to matter fitly disposed to make it perceive and think? In a
passage from Locke&rsquo;s Correspondence with Bishop Stillingfleet
Locke says this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The idea of matter is an extended solid substance; wherever there is
such a substance, there is matter; and the essence of matter, whatever
other qualities, not contained in that essence, it shall please God to
superadd to it. For example, God creates an extended solid substance,
without the superadding of anything else to it, and so we may consider
it at rest: to some parts of it he superadds motion, but it still has
the essence of matter: other parts of it he frames into plants, with
all the excellencies of vegetation, life and beauty, which are to be
found in a rose or a peach-tree, &amp;c. above the essence of matter
in general, but it is still but matter: to other parts he adds sense
and spontaneous motion, and those other properties that are to be
found in an elephant. Hitherto it is not doubted but the power of God
may go, and that the properties of a rose, a peach, or an elephant,
superadded to matter, change not the properties of matter; but matter
is in these things matter still. (Locke, 1823, Vol. III: 460; quoted
in Jolley 2015: 77)
</p></blockquote>

<p>
It would appear from this account that, in respect to material bodies,
superadded properties are those God adds to matter to create certain
kinds of things beyond the essence of matter, that yet leaves the
essence of matter unaffected. Locke&rsquo;s God is a clockmaker and
Locke seems to be claiming that any property and organization of
matter beyond its essence is a divine superaddition. So, the addition
of motion to some parts of matter previously at rest is a
superaddition. So too is the organization of matter into vegetative
life such as roses and peach trees. The organization which produces
the sense and spontaneous motion of animals, such as the elephant is
also superaddition. It is but a further step to perception and
thought. So, why object to the last step, Locke says, when everything
leading up to it is unproblematic?</p>

<p>
The language of &lsquo;addition&rsquo; or &lsquo;superaddition&rsquo;
seems to suggest a different model of superaddition than the one
offered in the last paragraph. It suggests that God creates matter
fitly disposed, and then <em>adds</em> something to it to make it
perceive and think. This model of superaddition makes one wonder what
exactly it is that God is adding to the matter fitly disposed. It
seems that there are no very good answers. This should lead us to try
to hang on to the model that says God creates the organization of a
rose, and elephant and a man and the creation of these <em>are</em>
the superadditions with no further addition necessary. But if
something in addition is required we might think of putting the
machine in motion. The simplest case is, perhaps, motion. Here,
presumably, all God has to do is give certain parts of matter a push
and they move. With peach trees and elephants, there is more of a
puzzle. Locke holds that all of vegetative life can be explained
mechanically. Still, the starting of the plant machine comes from
within. Perhaps whatever it is that sets the peach tree machine going
is that thing superadded. Perhaps the organization and the push are
both superadditions. Perhaps one can say the same of the elephant and
man.</p>

<p>
Given all this, how does Locke avoid the contradiction between his
adoption of the principle of Homogeneity and his assertion that
thinking matter is possible? There is a clue in the passage from his
correspondence with Stillingfleet quoted above. Locke&rsquo;s account
flies in the face of ancient materialism that claimed that matter has
eternally been in motion. It is this claim that the dualist Principle
of Homogeneity is aimed to counter. Let matter be eternally in motion,
it will still never produce anything other than motion. So, Locke uses
the Principle of Homogeneity in its strong dualist form to block the
creation of a material God. But once God is recognized to be
necessarily immaterial, Locke has a different account of the essence
of matter than the ancient materialists. As we have seen in the
passage of the correspondence with Stillingfleet, motion is not an
essential feature of matter, it is superadded. So, Locke can adopt a
much weaker version of the Principle of Homogeneity that puts no
constraints on God&rsquo;s Omnipotence. God can and does make things
which are quite different from one another cause one another. Motions
in the body cause pleasure and pain and the ideas of secondary
qualities such as color and sound. So motion can cause perception and
thought.</p>

<p>
It is certainly the case as Margaret Wilson pointed out that Locke
sees limits to Boylean mechanism in Locke&rsquo;s discussion of
thinking matter (Wilson 1999: 199). The problem is just that the
banging together of pieces of matter cannot explain perception and
thought. So, God must employ some other means which go beyond our
ideas to make this happen&mdash;and thus it is incomprehensible to
us. Locke also claims that God and perhaps the angels know how the
apparent qualities of man arise from atoms (III.6.3, N: 440).
Locke&rsquo;s suggestion that corpuscularian mechanism cannot explain
our ideas of secondary qualities, pleasure and pain seems to mean that
he has given up this claim of a divine demonstrative science of nature
(Wilson 1999: 197, 199&ndash;204). This
is because on a corpuscularian mechanist basis, the connections
between motions and colors, for example, are arbitrary. But, given
that God is using some other way to connect motions and colors, it
does not follow that the connections are arbitrary, though they seem
so to us. So, a divine understanding of nature might still be
possible.</p>

<h3 id="Upsh">The Upshot</h3>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s suggestions about thinking matter were often taken as
stronger than intended. Many of Locke&rsquo;s critics were suspicious
that Locke had materialist tendencies. Instead of the reconciling
conclusions about immaterial versus material substance that Locke is
arguing for, his remarks were sometimes treated as proposing that
matter can and does think. It hardly matters however. Samuel Clarke,
for example, a member of Newton&rsquo;s inner circle and an orthodox
Anglican theologian, engaged in a debate by correspondence or rather
public pamphlet with Anthony Collins over this issue between 1707 and
1708 (Uzgalis 2007). Clarke sought to show that from our ideas alone
it would be possible to show that matter thinking would involve a
contradiction. If Clarke is right, Locke (even on the weaker
interpretation explored here) would be wrong. There was an explosion
of refutations of the claim that for all we know matter can think and
the discussion of this issue lasted at least three quarters of the way
through the eighteenth century. For accounts of this debate see Yolton
(1983) and Martin and Baresi (2000)</p>

<h3 id="PersIden">Personal Identity</h3>

<p>
Locke added his Chapter &ldquo;Of Identity and Diversity&rdquo; (II.27) which gives his account of identity and personal identity to
the second edition of the <em>Essay</em>. His account of personal
identity is embedded in a general account of identity. Edwin McCann
has argued that Locke&rsquo;s general account of identity is intended
to supply a corpuscularian alternative to the Aristotelian account of
identity with its &lsquo;substantial forms.&rsquo; Hence we find Locke talking of the identity conditions for single atoms or masses of
atoms, which are plainly not observable by the senses. (McCann 1987:
54&ndash;7) But the general account is linked in important ways with
the main topic of the chapter, which is personal identity. Udo Thiel
in <em>The Early Modern Subject</em> (2011) provides a massive study
of the possible sources and influences on Locke&rsquo;s account of
personal identity, as well as a thoughtful, thorough and sometimes
quite original treatment of the host of issues raised by this
remarkable chapter of the <em>Essay</em>.</p>

<p>
In this general account of identity Locke begins by noting:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When we see anything in any place in one instant of time, we are sure,
(be it what it will) that it is that very thing and not another, which
at that time exists in another place, how like and undistinguishable it
may be in other respects. And in this consists <em>identity</em> when
the ideas it is attributed to vary not at all from what they were that
moment, wherein we consider their former existence, to which we
compare the present. (II. 27, 1, N. 328)  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke then goes on to state that two things of the same kind cannot be
in the same place at the same time and to draw a corollary from this
principle:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For we never finding nor conceiving it possible, that two things of
the same kind should exist at the same place at the same time, we
rightly conclude that anything that exists anywhere at any time,
excludes all of the same kind, and is there itself alone. When
therefore we demand whether anything be the same or no, it refers
always to something that existed such a time in such a place, which
t&rsquo;was certain, at that time was the same as it self, and no
other. From whence it follows that one thing cannot have two
beginnings of Existence, nor two things one beginning, it being
impossible for two things of the same kind to be or exist in the same
instant, in the very same place; or one and the same in different
places. That therefore that had one beginning is the same thing, and
that which had a different beginning in time and place is divers. (II, 27, 1 N. 328) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That two things can&rsquo;t be in the same place at the same time
seems like common sense. But what does Locke mean by
&lsquo;kind&rsquo; and why does he add this condition? Locke&rsquo;s
metaphysical machinery includes substances, modes and relations.
Substances are independent existences, while modes and relations
depend on substances for their existence. Locke claims that we have
the ideas of but three sorts of substances: God, finite intelligences
and bodies. He goes on to distinguish and explain the difference
between the identity of a single atom, masses of atoms and living
things. Each individual atom is the same at a time, and stays the same
over time. So, there is no problem about the identity of atoms. Masses
of atoms are individuated by their constituent atoms without regard to
the way in which they are organized. If such a mass gains or loses a
single atom, it has a new set of constituents and so is a new mass,
even if the organization of that mass stays the same. Living things,
by contrast, are individuated by their functional organization. This
organization is instantiated at any time by a collection of atoms. But
the organization can persist through changes in the particles which
make it up&mdash;at least gradual change which continues the functions
which the organization performs. Clearly the most important of these
functions is the continuation of the same life. It is the continuation
of the same functional organization and thus the same life which is
the criterion of identity for sameness of living thing, be it an oak
or a horse.</p>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s principle allows God, a soul and a body all to be in one
place at the same time for each of them belongs to one of the three
different kinds of substances that Locke has explicitly identified.
But it turns out that there are problems with Locke&rsquo;s apparently
obvious principle that two things of the same kind cannot be in the
same place at the same time. Some commentators would like to take
&lsquo;kind&rsquo;to mean the nominal essences of Book III of the
<em>Essay</em> to which particular things belong. But were that the
case a horse and an elephant, which have different nominal essences,
could be in the same place at the same time! If to avoid this problem,
we ascend the ladder of abstraction to &lsquo;animal&rsquo; similar
results can be produced. Instead of a horse and an elephant, one could
have a horse and an oak tree in the same place at the same time. This
suggests that Locke was perceptive in making bodies one kind.</p>

<p>
Locke himself, however, seems to create a problem when he
distinguishes a mass of atoms (which he calls a body) and the living
thing which depends on that body for existence at a time. If living
things and masses (which have a quite different set of individuative
criteria from living things) are both bodies, then we have two things
of the same kind (bodies) in the same place at the same time! For a
discussion of the various ways that have been proposed to solve this
problem see Stuart (2013) and Gordon-Roth (2015).</p>

<p>
An issue closely related to the problem of kinds is whether we should
take Locke to be an absolute identity theorist or a relative identity
theorist. Absolute identity theorists hold that individuative criteria
for different kinds are the unity conditions for that kind; they tell
us under what conditions you have an individual of that kind.
Individuative criteria thus vary from one kind to another. Identity,
however, determines that we have the same individual over time and
that relation is the same for all different kinds. Relative identity
theorists lump unity and sameness together. So, they hold that there
are different identity relations for each sort of thing. It follows
from the most extreme form of relative identity theory, that it is
possible for <i>x</i> to be the same <i>F</i> as <i>y</i> (where
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> stand for individuals and <i>F</i>, <i>G</i>,
etc for kinds) but not the same <i>G</i> as <i>y</i>, even though
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are both <i>F</i>s and <i>G</i>s. Absolute
identity theorists deny that these kind of true relative identity
statements are possible. They hold that relative identity is, in fact,
an incoherent doctrine.</p>

<p>
Peter Geach (1967: 11) first suggested that Locke&rsquo;s account of identity should be understood in terms of relative identity. In Locke&rsquo;s chapter the debate ranges over a series of pairs of kinds of individuals that the absolute identity theorist sees as distinct, while the relative identity theorist sees
as referring to the same thing. Are the oak and the mass of matter
which compose it at an instant two distinct things or are they one
thing to which two different sortals with different identity criteria
apply? Can one say that this individual horse (<i>x</i>) is the same
horse as that (y) but not the same mass of matter, even though both
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are horses and masses of matter? The same issue
applies to man and mass of matter, and soul and person. The most
recent defender of the relative identity position is Stuart
(2013).</p>

<h3 id="DefiMan">The Definition of Man</h3>

<p>
Locke holds that man is an animal and is thus individuated just like
other living things. So &lsquo;man&rsquo; refers to a living body of a
particular shape. Locke is perfectly aware that the definition of man
is not really settled, and that there are a variety of competing
definitions. He argues for his own definition, which involves
distinguishing between &lsquo;man&rsquo; and &lsquo;person&rsquo; by
using a variety of thought experiments and deducing unacceptable
consequences from competing definitions. He points out, for example,
that while those who individuate man solely in terms of the possession
of a soul can explain the sameness of man from infancy to old age, if
they accept some doctrine of reincarnation, their definition requires
that the same soul in different bodies be the same man as much as
infant and old man. If the doctrine of reincarnation allows the soul
of a man to be reborn in the body of an animal, such as a hog, if we
knew that the soul of a man was in one of our hogs, it would require
us to call the hog a man. Locke pairs the examples of a rational
talking parrot with a creature that has the shape of a man but cannot
engage in rational discourse as a thought experiment which
demonstrates that rational discourse is neither a necessary or
sufficient condition for being a man. So, Locke rejects the
Aristotelian definition of man. On Locke&rsquo;s account, then, man is
defined as a living body, an animal of a certain shape. Animals, Locke
tells us, are like machines, in that they are an organization or
construction of parts to a certain end. Locke makes this simile
explicit. Having described a watch he goes on to note the similarities
and differences between machines and animals:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If we should suppose this machine one continued Body, all whose
organized Parts were repair&rsquo;d, increas&rsquo;d, or
diminish&rsquo;d by a constant addition or separation of insensible
parts, with one Common Life, we should have something very much like
the body of an Animal, with this difference, that in an animal the
fitness of the organization and the motion wherein Life consists,
begin together, the motion coming from within; but in machines the
force coming sensibly from without, is often away when the Organ is in
order, and well fitted to receive it. (II.27.5, N: 331) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Earlier in the <em>Essay</em> Locke, in distinguishing between plants,
animals and humans had noted that while plants can be treated
mechanistically, mechanism begins to fail in animals. Bird song is
learned and so Cartesian mechanistic accounts fail, because mechanism
cannot account for learned behavior. As noted earlier, it also fails
for the perception of secondary qualities and thought. Whether Locke
has retreated from that position here in II xxvii, and returned to a
more Cartesian view is an interesting question. But assuming that this
problem can be solved, what is a person?</p>

<h3 id="PersCons">Persons and Consciousness</h3>

<p>
In section 9 of II.27 Locke tells us that a person is </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and reflection, and can
consider it self as it self, the same thinking thing in different
times and places; which is done only by that consciousness, which is
inseparable from thinking, and as it seems to me essential to it; It
being impossible for anyone to perceive, without perceiving that he
does perceive. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&lsquo;Consciousness&rsquo; was quite a new term in English philosophy
at the end of the seventeenth century. Ralph Cudworth had coined the
term in his <em>The True Intellectual System of the Universe</em> as a
translation of a Greek word used by Plotinus. Cudworth used the term
in attacking Hobbes&lsquo; materialism and Cudworth took consciousness
to be essentially immaterial. The term had also been used in a public
controversy over the Trinity between two English divines, Robert South
and William Sherlock. Thiel holds that Locke had both Cudworth&rsquo;s
use of the term and the Trinity controversy on his mind when he wrote
his account of personal identity.</p>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s account of consciousness, unlike Cudworth&rsquo;s is
neutral in respect to the materiality or immateriality of the soul.
Locke writes: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Self</em> is that conscious thinking thing, (whatever Substance
made up of whether Spiritual or Material, Simple or Compounded, it
matters not) which is sensible or conscious of Pleasure and Pain,
capable of Happiness or Misery, and so is concerned for its
<em>self</em> as far as that consciousness extends. (II.27.17, N: 341)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here we get an even more detailed list of possibilities as in the
thinking matter passage, we have not only material or immaterial, but
simple and compounded. Locke is saying that the substance that thinks
in us could be any one of the eight combinations of possibilities,
that is either simple and immaterial, simple and material and so on,
and still produce the full range of conscious phenomena that Locke
enumerates.</p>

<p>
There have been a number of attempts to explain what Locke means by
&lsquo;consciousness.&rsquo; Some have treated it as a species of
reflection, others as a Higher Order of Perception (HOP) type of
theory&mdash;that is when one perceives that one perceives one is
conscious. Udo Thiel in <em>The Early Modern Subject</em> treats
reflection as an HOP theory, but holds that consciousness is neither.
Thiel writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Locke says that &ldquo;consciousness is <em>inseparable</em> from
thinking, and as it seems to me essential to it&hellip;When we see,
hear, smell, taste, feel, meditate or will anything, we know that we
do so. Thus it is always as to our present Sensation and
Perception.&rdquo; For Locke, being conscious denotes an immediate
awareness that is an integral part of all acts of thinking as
such&hellip;According to Locke, the mind relates to itself in the sense
that it observes its own operations and produces ideas of them. In
other words, consciousness is a presence of the mind to itself, that
unlike reflection, consciousness is not a HOP. Without consciousness,
reflection would not have any objects on which to reflect. (Thiel
2011: 114&ndash;115) </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ManPers">Man and Person</h3>

<p>
Why does Locke make this distinction between &lsquo;man&rsquo; and
&lsquo;person?&rsquo; There are several answers. One is that having
denied that man is a rational animal, one wonders what role
rationality is to play, if any. What Locke does is to transfer it to
the definition of &lsquo;person.&rsquo; Another answer is that the
distinction solves a problem associated with of the resurrection of
the dead. What is this problem? The problem begins with Biblical texts
asserting that we will have the same body at the Resurrection as we
did in this life. The issue is in what sense this is true (and whether
the Bible actually says this). Clearly there are problems with the
supposition that one will. Robert Boyle, in his essay, &ldquo;Some
Physico-Theological Considerations About the Possibility of the
Resurrection&rdquo; had raised some of these puzzles. Boyle
writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When a man is once really dead, divers of the parts of his body will,
according to the course of nature, resolve themselves into multitudes
of steams that wander to and fro in the air; and the remaining parts,
that are either liquid or soft, undergo so great a corruption and
change, that it is not possible so many scattered parts should be
again brought together, and reunited after the same manner, wherein
they existed in a human body whilst it was yet alive. And much more
impossible it is to effect this reunion, if the body have been, as it
often happens, devoured by wild beasts or fishes; since in this case,
though the scattered parts of the cadaver might be recovered as
particles of matter, yet already having passed into the substance of
other animals, they are quite transmuted, as being informed by the new
form of the beast or fish that devoured them and of which they now
make a substantial part. (Boyle 1675 [1979: 198]) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These difficulties with putting bodies back together are obviously
considerable, though not perhaps beyond the powers of Omnipotence. The
culminating problem, however, is what happens to the man whose body is
eaten by cannibals. Boyle continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
And yet far more impossible will this reintegration be, if we put the
case that the dead man was devoured by cannibals; for then, the same
flesh belonging successively to two different persons, it is
impossible that both should have it restored to them at once, or that
any footsteps should remain of the relation it had to the first
possessor. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These problems I suspect represent the kinds of difficulties which
faced the scientists of the Royal Society, and with which Boyle was
particularly concerned, in integrating the kinds of explanations of
natural phenomena in terms of particles and matter in motion, with the
truths of religion.</p>

<p>
Locke explicitly tells us that the prince and the cobbler thought
experiment in section 15 shows us the resolution of the problem of the
same body at the resurrection. The case is one in which the soul of
the prince with all of its princely thoughts is transferred from the
body of the prince to the body of the cobbler, the cobbler&rsquo;s
soul having departed. The result of this exchange, is that the prince
still considers himself the prince, even though he finds himself in an
altogether new body. Locke&rsquo;s distinction between man and person
makes it possible for the same person to show up in a different body
at the resurrection and yet still be the same person. Thus his answer
is the same as the one Boyle gives in the work quoted above. In his
correspondence with Bishop Stillingfleet he all but says that the idea
of being resurrected in the same body is incoherent. Locke focuses on
the prince with all his princely thoughts because, on his view, it is
consciousness which is crucial to the reward and punishment which is
to be meted out at the Last Judgment.</p>

<p>
In this chapter on identity, Locke is also claiming that
consciousness need not be connected to a single soul. Let us turn
then, to the distinction between soul and consciousness.</p>

<h3 id="SoulCons">Soul and Consciousness</h3>

<p>
Though the distinction between man and person is controversial,
Locke&rsquo;s severing the connection over time between the soul or
the thing which thinks in us and consciousness is even more radical.
Locke holds that consciousness can be transferred from one soul to
another, and that personal identity goes with consciousness. In
section 12 of the Chapter &lsquo;Of Identity and Diversity&rsquo; (27)
he raises two questions: &ldquo;&hellip;if the same Substance which
thinks be changed, it can be the same person, or remaining the same,
it can be a different person&rdquo;. Locke&rsquo;s answer to both of
these questions is affirmative. Consciousness can be transferred from
one substance to another and thus while the soul is changed,
consciousness remains the same and thus personal identity is preserved
through the change. And on the other hand, consciousness can be lost
as in utter forgetfulness while the soul or thinking substance remains
the same.  Under these conditions there is the same soul but a
different person.  These affirmations amount to the claim that the
same soul or thinking substance is neither necessary nor sufficient
for personal identity over time. The arguments are developed by
analogy with the functional organization of animals which is preserved
through the gradual changes in the atoms which instantiate that
organization at any given time.  So, at any given time there must be a
soul or thinking substance, but over time there is no necessity that
one have the same soul to preserve personal identity. </p>

<p>
The rejection of having the same soul as a sufficient condition for
personal identity does a fair amount of work for Locke. It underlies
the Castor and Pollux thought experiment in II.27.9&ndash;20 and many
of the thought experiments in II.27. including the Day Man Night Man,
and most notably the Prince and the Cobbler. The Castor Pollux thought
experiment makes it plain that not only does Locke reject
Descartes&rsquo; claim that thinking is his essence, he also rejects
the claim that as a person he is essentially a substance. Why Locke
rejects the claim that having the same soul is a necessary condition
for personal identity is not as clear. This is one of the most
significant changes from Locke&rsquo;s discussion of personal identity
in the first edition passage (II.1.9&ndash;20) to the chapter
&ldquo;Of Identity and Diversity&rdquo; added to the second edition.
</p>

<p>
One answer is epistemological. Locke is skeptical about our ability to
reidentify the same soul over time. He claims that if we were always
awake, we could be certain that we had the same soul. But
consciousness has natural gaps in it, such as periods during which we
are asleep. Locke claims that there is no way of knowing that one soul
has not been substituted for another during this period of absence of
consciousness. Thus if having the same soul is necessary for personal
identity we could never be sure that we were the same person as the
day before. Perhaps another reason is that the preservation of
personal identity through changes of substance is an important
similarity in the analogy between living things and persons that Locke
announces in II.27.11&ndash;12 and is part of an anti-Cartesian
argument. Still, the rejection of the soul as a necessary condition
for personal identity causes Locke at least one serious difficulty,
which he discusses in II.27.13. If consciousness can be transferred
from one soul to another it is information that is transferred and not
the act of consciousness. But information, as in dreams, can be false.
So, it seems possible that a person might come to believe that they
had done something that, in fact, some other person had done or that
no one had done. (For a discussion of this problem see Garrett 2003
and Strawson 2011) The rejection of the same soul as either a
necessary or a sufficient condition for personal identity leads to the
question of whether, on Locke view, the soul is a substance or a mode.
</p>

<p>
In recent years there has developed a debate about whether persons are
substances or modes. Ruth Mattern in her article &ldquo;Moral Science
and the Concept of a Person in Locke&rdquo; (1980), Antonia LaLordo in
&ldquo;Person, Substance, Mode and the Moral Man in Locke&rsquo;s
Philosophy&rdquo; (2010) and Galen Strawson in <em>Locke on Personal
Identity</em> (2011) have developed the evidence for mode
interpretations. Strawson is the closest to Edmund Law&rsquo;s
eighteenth century mode interpretation, making persons the forensic
aspect of human beings. Uzgalis (2000) has a different version that
makes both living things and person modes. For the view that Locke
thinks persons are substances see Alston and Bennett (1988).
</p>

<h3 id="CariForSelfPersForeTerm">Caring for the Self and &lsquo;person&rsquo; as a Forensic Term</h3>

<p>
A number of features of Locke&rsquo;s definition of person as a
thinking intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can know
itself as itself (i.e., as the same thinking thing in different times and
places) are designed to account for the fact that we are creatures who
are capable of operating the machinery of the law. It is for this
reason that &lsquo;person&rsquo; is a forensic term. When
contemplating an action we can think that in the future we will be the
same being who will be punished or rewarded for the course of action
which we choose. When being punished we can look back and see that we
are the same being who committed the act for which we are being
punished. Locke holds that consciousness is essential for justice to
be done. If one is punished for doing something which one does not
remember doing, it is equivalent to being created miserable. So, since
consciousness plays the most important role in our being punished or
rewarded at the last judgment for our actions, and consciousness can
be transferred from one soul to another, and we have no mechanism to
reidentify souls over time, it becomes clear why consciousness is
Locke&rsquo;s choice for the bearer of personal identity, and why he
makes the distinction between the substance which thinks in us and
consciousness. I think this account explains a variety of oddities and
difficulties in Locke&rsquo;s account. On his account, for example,
memory must be completely accurate&mdash;at least in the respects
relevant for divine judicial purposes. Evidence which others might
produce about one&rsquo;s identity has no role to play in divine
justice and so forth. Locke&rsquo;s account of freedom of action is
also connected with his view of the forensic nature of personal
identity. Freedom to review the decisions one has made about how to
act is clearly of great importance in being able to operate the law.
If one could not pause to consider, and change one&rsquo;s mind about
what one was going to do, it might well be said that one could not do
otherwise.</p>

<p>
Rationality and caring for the self are also important components of
the forensic character of personal identity. If one did not care about
oneself, did not care whether one was happy or miserable, then there
would be little reason to pursue the one and avoid the other. Reason
presumably should play an important role in figuring out what
decisions to make and what road to take to pursue happiness rather
than misery. Obeying the laws both human and divine might well be the
road to happiness, while violating them might lead in the direction of
misery. </p>

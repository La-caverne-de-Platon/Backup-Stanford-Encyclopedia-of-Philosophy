<h3 id="MeasGravWron">1. Measuring the gravity of a wrong</h3>

<p>
Two dimensions of wrongdoing figure most prominently in its gravity:
the magnitude of the harm or wrong inflicted or risked, and the
culpability of the wrongdoer for bringing it about or risking it.
There is empirical evidence that people across a wide range of
demographics can rank order even subtle variations of &ldquo;core
wrongs&hellip;&mdash;physical aggression, takings without consent, and
deception in exchanges&mdash;&rdquo; with surprising consistency
(Robinson &amp; Kurzban 2007: 1892). These subtle variations involve,
for example, two thefts differing primarily only in that one involved
sneaking into an open garage while the other involved breaking into a
locked house (2007: 1895). Extreme concerns about arbitrariness in
rankings, at least of <em>mala in se</em> crimes, are somewhat
alleviated by these studies. (The implications of this for <em>mala
prohibita</em> crimes are discussed in Walen forthcoming.) Nonetheless, there are
worrisome difficulties.</p>

<p>
The fundamental difficulty is in bringing the two
dimensions&mdash;magnitude of the harm and culpability for causing or
risking it&mdash;together into a single dimension of
&ldquo;gravity&rdquo;. Consider Hart&rsquo;s question (1968: 162):
&ldquo;Is negligently causing the destruction of a city worse than the
intentional wounding of a single policeman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Other complexities only add to that fundamental difficulty. First,
does it matter if harm is caused, or is the gravity of the wrong set
fully by the wrong risked or intended? (For the position that harm
does not matter, see Feinberg 1995; Alexander, Ferzan, &amp; Morse
2009; for a criticism of that view, see Levy 2005; Westen 2009; Walen
2010. The Model Penal Code, &sect; 5.05(1), aspires to reject the
relevance of harm caused, but does not do so completely.)</p>

<p>
Second, what significance, if any, should be given to the difference
between being punished for the first time, and having been punished
before and then having committed the same or a similar wrong again?
Many retributivists resist the idea that past convictions should
matter, on the grounds that having been punished already, more severe
punishment for the next wrong would effectively constitute double
punishment for the first (Singer 1979: ch. 5; Fletcher 2000: 462).
Others think there is a way around this problem. One approach is to
hold the repeat offender guilty of a culpable omission: the failure
&ldquo;to organize his life in a way that reduces the risk of his
reoffending&rdquo; (Lee 2009: 578). Another is to defend a
first-offender discount, reflecting human susceptibility to temptation
(frailty). This discount would progressively diminish for subsequent
comparable offenses, effectively raising the offender&rsquo;s
culpability (von Hirsch &amp; Ashworth 2005: 148&ndash;155), and it
would apply only to lesser wrongs, as it is hard to sympathize with
frailty when it comes to serious crimes such as rape or murder (Duff
2001: 169). Both versions of a recidivist premium should be
distinguished from Duff&rsquo;s view that persistent dangerous
offenders may effectively forfeit their right to be treated as equal
citizens (2001: &sect;4.2).</p>

<p>
Third, do the background conditions in which a wrongdoer acts affect
her culpability for a particular wrong? Some think that coming from a
severely deprived or &ldquo;rotten social background&rdquo; undermines
a wrongdoer&rsquo;s culpability (Bazelon 1976; Delgado 1985; Gardner
1998; Delgado 2011). Others think coming from such a background is a
&ldquo;tragedy, but it should not be a defense to crime&rdquo; (Morse
2011). Others distinguish ways in which it might be relevant to
punishment, not because it limits what a proportional punishment can
be, but because it calls for compassion (von Hirsch &amp; Ashworth
2005: &sect;5.3.1) or disqualification of the
 state&mdash;<a href="index-2.html#WhoMayPuni">see section 4.2</a>.
 (For other sources of complexity, see Feinberg 1995: 132.)</p>

<h3 id="PuniPropCrim">2. Punishment proportional to a crime</h3>

<p>
There are two basic senses of proportionality: cardinal and ordinal.
Cardinal proportionality sets absolute measures for punishment that is
proportional to a given crime; ordinal proportionality requires only
that more serious crimes be punished more severely than less serious crimes.</p>

<p>
<em>Lex Talionis</em>
 (<a href="index-2.html#LexTaliPaybRespKind">section 3.6</a>)
 offers a theory of cardinal proportionality. In its traditional
form&mdash;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&mdash;it seems
implausible, both for being too lenient in some cases (take $10 from a
thief who stole $10), and too extreme in others (repeatedly torture
and rape someone who had committed many such acts himself). Kant
proposed what might be thought a better version, saying that the thief
should lose not just the value of what he stole, but instead all
rights to property (1797: 142), and prohibiting those forms of
&ldquo;mistreatment that could make the humanity in the person
suffering it into something abominable&rdquo; (ibid.). Nonetheless,
his measure for theft swings to the overly punitive side, leaving the
convicted thief a dependent on the state, and thereby &ldquo;reduced
to the status of a slave for a certain time, or permanently if the
state sees fit&rdquo; (ibid.). Others have tried to rehabilitate
<em>lex talionis</em>, arguing, for example, that it can be rendered
plausible if interpreted to call for punishment that
&ldquo;possess[es] some or all of the characteristics that made the
offense wrong&rdquo; (Waldron 1992: 35). But however one spells out
the wrong-making characteristics, it seems likely that <em>lex
talionis</em> will provide a measure either too vague to be of much
help (see Shafer-Landau 1996: 299&ndash;302; 2000: 197&ndash;198), or
too specific to be plausible (at least in some cases).</p>

<p>
A purely ordinal approach, however, also has problems. If all that
were required to do justice is to rank order wrongs by their gravity
and then provide a mapping onto a range of punishments that likewise
went from lighter to more serious&mdash;respecting the norms of
rank-ordering and parity&mdash;then neither the range of punishments
from a fine of $1 up to a fine of $100, nor from 40 years to 60 years
in prison, would provide disproportionate punishment, no matter what
the crimes. This seems wrong. Murder should not be punished with a
$100 fine, and littering should not be punished with 40 years in
prison. Some measure of cardinality therefore seems to be called for,
punishing grave wrongs with heavy penalties and minor wrongs with
light penalties.</p>

<p>
The possibility of anchoring certain punishments within these broad
bands of acceptable cardinal values, and then using ordinal
proportionality to fill in the spaces between these anchor points,
arguably provides for an acceptable and complete scale of proportional
punishment (see Kleinig 1973: 123&ndash;124). If one believes that it
is also possible to have a sense for relative degree of gravity, then
such an anchored ordinal system can prevent clustering near any anchor
point, and provide a fairly precise, plausible scale of proportional
punishment that could be used in any given jurisdiction (von Hirsch
&amp; Ashworth 2005: &sect;9.3).</p>

<p>
It is worth emphasizing that such a scale would not have universal
application. It would depend on a jurisdiction choosing certain anchor
points within the acceptable ranges, and thus would apply only within
that jurisdiction. But if such jurisdictional variation can be
tolerated, then the scales so provided would be far less vague and
open to consequentialist input in setting punishment than the scale
embraced by limiting
 retributivism&mdash;<a href="index-2.html#LimiRetr">see section 3.4</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Some think that this sort of flexibility would be problematic because
retributivism is inherently inclined towards cruel harshness (Dolinko
1991; Garland 2001; Whitman 2003; Ristroff 2009; Lacey &amp; Pickard
2015b). This is a mistake if taken as a conceptual point (Robinson
2008; Flanders 2010; Gray &amp; Huber 2010; Duus-Otterstr&ouml;m
2013). There are empirical reasons to worry that, in practice,
retributivism goes hand in hand with excessive harshness. On the other
hand, the evidence may show more correlation than causation.</p>

<p>
Working against a tendency to cruelty is the principle of parsimony,
which adds downward normative pressure to the range of anchoring
points. The idea is that since punishment involves suffering, it
should be inflicted as minimally as possible, consistent with the
vague limits of cardinal desert and any other goals (including
deterrence and incapacitation) that should be cited to provide a full
justification for punishment. Importantly, parsimony is not to be
confused with mercy. Mercy involves giving a wrongdoer less than she
deserves out of compassion or humanitarian concern for her wellbeing
(Hampton in Murphy &amp; Hampton 1988: 158&ndash;159; Gray 2010:
1692). Parsimony is a reason for lowering the scale of punishments
from which one can determine what a wrongdoer deserves, again within
any given jurisdiction.</p>

<p>
While the idea of a scale of punishments may suggest a certain linear
simplicity, it is important to keep in mind that the severity of a
punishment depends on at least two dimensions: the degree of
harshness, and its duration or repetition (for corporal punishment).
One might think that duration and harshness can simply be traded off,
but retributivists have reason favor shorter, harsher punishments over
longer, more lenient ones (Tomlin 2014b). In brief, it is bad, from a
retributive point of view, if a wrongdoer does not get the punishment
she deserves, and the longer it takes for her to get the full
punishment she deserves, the greater the chance that she will either
die or change in such a way that it is no longer reasonable to punish
her for what she did.</p>

<h3 id="CritRetrBaseProbProp">3. Criticisms of retributivism based on problems with proportionality</h3>

<p>
Greg Roebuck and David Wood (2011) claim that it is incumbent on
punishers to <em>demonstrate</em> that the punishment they propose to
inflict is not disproportionately large. Given that moral anchoring
can provide at best a very rough set of guidelines for proportional
punishment, and that the methods of extrapolating from or
interpolating between them are also highly underdetermined, they argue
that no one can meet this burden. Therefore, a retributive commitment
to proportionality would require the abolition of punishment.</p>

<p>
This critique rests on the premise that there might be true
proportional punishments that any actual punishment might exceed, no
matter how parsimonious the scale of punishment on which it rests. But
a more plausible reading of the vagueness of anchors and the process
of reasoning from them is that they provide an acceptable range in
which to build an internally consistent schedule of punishments. Thus,
a more reasonable conclusion to draw, in the face of epistemic
uncertainty, is that any given schedule of punishments should stick to
the lower end of the intuitively acceptable spectrum of punishments
(Duus-Otterstr&ouml;m 2013).</p>

<p>
Claire Finkelstein (2004) raises a different sort of
proportionality-based objection to retributivism. She claims that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
retributivists&rsquo; theory of punishment was supposed itself to
answer the question of which punishments are morally acceptable and
which are not. (2004: 213) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<em>Lex talionis</em> at least promised to explain what sorts of
punishments are justified, but given that it fails, it seems that
retributivism cannot account for why we find certain punishments
acceptable&mdash;primarily imprisonment, fines, community service,
probation, the loss of certain rights, and possibly the death
penalty&mdash;and reject others, such as torture, shaming punishments,
or forced sterilization (2004: 212&ndash;213).</p>

<p>
The problem with Finkelstein&rsquo;s objection is that she assigns to
retributivists a task that they have no reason to accept. Yes,
proportionality should rule out certain punishments on the ground that
they are disproportionately large. But there is no reason for
retributivists not to look to other criteria, such as respect for
human dignity, to prohibit those forms of punishment that seem cruel
or degrading. (Determining how to judge the permissibility of the
death penalty is a particularly thorny problem, beyond the scope of
this entry. For a brief survey of the difficulty, see Edmundson
2002.)</p>

<p>
Adam Kolber (2013) raises the most difficult proportionality-based
criticism of retributivism. He starts from the observation that
countries that use pre-trial detention seem universally to give those
who are convicted credit for the time they have served. For example,
if someone gets a sentence of a year, and has spent six months in jail
in pre-trial detention, she would have to serve only six additional
months. Serving the full year, after spending six months in jail
already, would seem to be a disproportionate sentence. But it is
hard to explain the intuition that this practice is morally required
in any way other than by recognizing that hard treatment inflicted in
connection with a crime is relevant to the size of the punishment,
even if it wasn&rsquo;t intended as punishment at the time it was
inflicted. If, however, hard treatment inflicted in connection with a
crime counts towards the size of the punishment, then we seem to be
thrown back onto the sort of view about suffering rejected in
 <a href="index-2.html#SubjSuffMeasExpeCausSuff">section 4.3.3</a>,
 the view that what matters is how much a person suffers, whether or
not the suffering was inflicted as part of a punishment. (For a way of
addressing Kolber&rsquo;s problem that builds on the assumption that
suffering counts even if not part of punishment, see Alexander &amp;
Ferzan 2018: 200&ndash;204.)</p>

<p>
This is a difficult problem for retributivists. One solution is for
retributivists to give up the claim (<em>contra</em> Husak 1990) that
their commitment to proportionality requires them to give credit for
pre-trial detention, as pre-trial detention is not meant to be
punitive. Perhaps they have other reasons for giving credit for
pre-trial detention at sentencing, perhaps reasons of mercy or
fairness. But it would be an odd sort of requirement of mercy, as
mercy is usually taken to be discretionary. And if called for as a
matter of fairness, it is unclear why fairness does not require the
other accommodations that Kolber notes and that nonetheless seem
counter-intuitive. This is not to say that retributivists could not
come up with an adequate response to Kolber&mdash;perhaps linked to
the response offered in
 <a href="index-2.html#SubjSuffMeasExpeCausSuff">section 4.3.3</a>
 to his arguments regarding excessive suffering&mdash;but they have
work to do.</p>

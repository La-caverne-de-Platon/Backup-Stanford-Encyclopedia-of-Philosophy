<h3 id="UnshCredDutcBook">A. Unsharp Credences and Dutch Books</h3>

<p>
Walley (1991: sec. 2.2 and 2.3) develops a betting account of
credences that permits one to have a variety of attitudes toward bets
or the lack of thereof, which does not force a credence to be as sharp
as a real number. On this view, a credence can be unsharp in this way:
it can be bounded by one or another interval of real numbers
<em>without</em> being equal to any particular real number or
interval&mdash;even the tightest bound on a credence can be an
<em>incomplete</em> description of that credence. The result is a
version of Probabilism permitting that kind of unsharp credences,
defended with a Dutch Book argument. The following sketches
Walley&rsquo;s main ideas.</p>

<p>
Suppose, for example, that a person is considering a bet that wins $1
if <i>A</i> is true, for some specific proposition <i>A</i>, and that
she takes it acceptable to buy the bet at the price $.8, and
acceptable to sell it at the price $.9. In that case, the
agent&rsquo;s credence in proposition <i>A</i> is postulated to have a
bound \([.8, .9]\). And that credence has that bound even when the
agent has different sorts of attitudes toward the prices in between,
such as:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>taking it to be acceptable to buy or sell at some intermediate
prices,</li>

<li>having made up her mind to <em>refuse to buy or sell</em> at some
intermediate prices,</li>

<li>having <em>never thought of</em> some intermediate prices as
yet,</li>

<li>having thought of some intermediate prices but remaining
<em>undecided</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Those cases seem to be realistic possibilities that need to be
accommodated, and Walley&rsquo;s account is designed to accommodate
them. Now, the agent&rsquo;s credence in <i>A</i> is bounded by
interval \([.8, .9]\). This interval-bound is only taken to give an
incomplete description of the agent&rsquo;s credence in <i>A</i>
because it leaves the four cases (i)&ndash;(iv) unspecified. Even when
\([.8, .9]\) is the tightest bound of the credence, only case (i) is
eliminated and cases (ii)&ndash;(iv) remain unspecified, so this
interval is still only an <em>incomplete</em> description of the
credence. That is, even when a credence has \([.8, .9]\) as the
tightest bound, it is <em>not</em> equal to that bound.</p>

<p>
More generally, Walley assumes a certain credence-betting bridge
principle, which I take the liberty to simplify as follows for the
sake of accessibility:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li>

<p>
<em class="sc">A Credence-Betting Bridge Principle (Bounding
Version)</em>. An agent&rsquo;s credence in a proposition <i>A</i> is
bounded by a closed interval \([a, b]\) of real numbers iff it is
acceptable for the agent to</p>

<ul class="subhang">

<li>buy the bet &ldquo;Win \(\$x\) if <i>A</i> is true&rdquo; at
\(\$ax\),</li>

<li>sell it at \(\$bx\).</li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
This setting is also liberal enough to model the case in which one has
no credence at all in a proposition: it can be identified with the
limiting case in which one&rsquo;s credence in a proposition is
bounded by no closed interval. To see how this bridge principle works,
imagine an agent whose credence in proposition \(A\) is bounded by
\([0.73, 0.80]\) and whose credence in \(\neg A\) is bounded by
\([0.28, 0.30]\). This agent is susceptible to this Dutch Book:</p>

<div>

<table class="centered cellpad-med-dense hrulesTH">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: center;"></th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><i>A</i> is true</th>
<th style="text-align: left;"><i>A</i> is false</th> </tr> </thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<th style="text-align: right;">buy &ldquo;win \($100\) if <i>A</i> is
true&rdquo; at \(\$73\)</th>
  <td style="text-align: left;">\(-$73 + $100\)</td>
  <td style="text-align: left;">\(-$73\)</td> </tr>
<tr class="even">
<th style="text-align: right;">buy &ldquo;win \($100\) if \(\neg A\)
is true&rdquo; at \(\$28\)</th>
  <td style="text-align: left;">\(-$28\)</td>
  <td style="text-align: left;">\(-$28 + $100\)</td> </tr>
<tr class="odd">
<th style="text-align: right;">net payoff</th>
  <td style="text-align: left;">\(-$1\)</td>
  <td style="text-align: left;">\(-$1\)</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>
The above example motivates a new version of Probabilism. A function
\(f\) that maps some propositions to real numbers is said to
<em>satisfy</em> a bound \([a, b]\) of one&rsquo;s credence in
proposition \(A\) if \(f(A)\) exists and \(a \le f(A) \le b\). Note
that there is no probability measure that simultaneously satisfies the
two credence bounds in the above example, because even the lower ends
of those two bounds, 0.73 and 0.28, are still too large to sum to 1.
This observation motivates the following norm:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><em class="sc">Probabilism (Interval-Satisfiability Version).</em>
An agent&rsquo;s credences ought be such that their bounds are
simultaneously satisfied by a probability measure.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Walley (1991: section 3.3.3) develops a Dutch Book argument for this
norm.</p>

<p>
The above is only one of the many approaches to unsharp credences. For
details and comparisons, see Mahtani (2019) and the entry on
 <a href="../imprecise-probabilities/index.html">imprecise probabilities</a>.</p>
 </div>

<div id="sec-order-cond">

<h3 id="CompProbCondCred">B. Comparative Probability and Conditional Credence</h3>

<p>
Comparative probabilities can express nuanced opinions that elude
<em>real-valued</em> unconditional credences (as mentioned in
 <a href="index-2.html#sec-regular">section 3.3</a>).
 But Easwaran (2014: sec. 2.4) suggests that comparative probabilities
can still be represented <em>numerically</em> if there can be
conditional credences given a proposition that has a zero credence
(such conditional credences are the topic of
 <a href="index-2.html#sec-prim-condi">section 3.4</a>):</p>
 
<ol type="i">

<li>\(A\) is taken to be more probable than \(B\) iff, conditional on
\(A \cup B\), \(A\) has a higher credence than \(B\) does, i.e.,
\(\Cr(A \mid A \cup B) &gt; \Cr(B \mid A \cup
 B)\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup></li>
 
<li>\(A\) is taken to be as probable as \(B\) is iff \(\Cr(A \mid A
\cup B) = \Cr(B \mid A \cup B)\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Sentences (i) and (ii) can be taken to express a definition of
comparative probabilities or, alternatively, a normative constraint.
Let&rsquo;s see how this account works for the Coin Case: Given the
disjunction of &ldquo;the coin is fair&rdquo; and &ldquo;the coin is
both fair and unfair&rdquo;, the credence in fairness should be 1 and
the credence in the logical contradiction should be 0. So by (i), the
fairness of the coin is taken as more probable than the logical
contradiction, even though both are assigned unconditional credence
0.</p>
</div>

<div id="sec-jaynes">

<h3 id="IndiPrinJeffJaynAppr">C. The Indifference Principle: The Jeffreys-Jaynes Approach</h3>

<p>
The Jeffreys-Jaynes approach to the Indifference Principle yields a
consistent answer \(1/2\) for the Square Case. Their inspiration comes
from a closer look at the Six-Faced Die Case: this case involves a
kind of physical symmetry; namely, nothing essential changes when the
six faces of the die are transformed into one another by a
permutation. So it seems only natural to assign equal credences to
those six faces in light of the symmetry. Following that idea,
Jeffreys (1946) and Jaynes (1968, 1973) note something to this effect:
the Square Case involves a kind of physical symmetry such that nothing
essential changes when a <em>scalar</em> quantity therein (length or
area) is transformed by the choice of a new unit. This kind of
symmetry, when properly formalized, gives a consistent answer for the
Square Case: credence \(1/2\) should be assigned to the proposition
that the side length is 1 to 2 cm, and also to the equivalent
proposition that the area is 1 to 4 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>
Let me provide an elementary derivation of the \(1/2\) credence. A
<em>scalar</em> is a quantity that has an absolute zero together with
this invariance property: nothing essential changes under the choice
of a new unit. Examples include length, area, frequency, and period of
time, but perhaps do not include time or potential energy if they lack
an absolute zero. A scalar has a second invariance property: nothing
essential changes when we take the inverse of the unit, such as
transforming period-in-seconds to frequency-in-hertz. For the purposes
of the Jeffrey-Jaynes approach, the second invariance property is
actually derivable from the first one with the help of calculus, but
it is assumed here to facilitate a calculus-free presentation.</p>

<p>
Now consider the Square Case. To argue that the length-interval \((1,
2)\) with a unit of one centimeter should be assigned credence
\(1/2\), it suffices to argue that the length-intervals \((1, 2)\) and
\((2, 4)\) should be assigned equal credences (assuming for simplicity
that a zero credence should be assigned to the boundary point \(2\)).
To argue for that, first change the unit from 1 centimeter to 2 centimeters. So, dividing
everything by 2, the above two length-intervals can be expressed as
\((\frac{1}{2}, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) in the new unit. But those two
intervals can be transformed into each other by taking the inverse of
the new unit. So they should be assigned equal credences, as
promised.</p>

<p>
What&rsquo;s important is how this helps to reply to Bertrand&rsquo;s
paradox. There will be no incompatible results if we apply the same
argument to another scalar quantity, area. With a change of unit
(namely, dividing everything by \(4\)), area-intervals \((1, 4)\) and
\((4, 16)\) can be transformed to \((\frac{1}{4}, 1)\) and \((1,4)\),
which can be transformed into each other by taking the inverse of the
new unit.</p>

<p>
A thorough presentation that takes care of all possible intervals
requires applying calculus to probability density functions and,
philosophically, it also requires engaging with the problem of using
the so-call <em>improper</em> priors: distributions of prior credences
that appear to violate the Normalization condition in Probabilism. See
Jaynes (1968) for details.</p>

<p>
Despite the above reply to Bertrand&rsquo;s paradox, there is still
the worry that this approach fails to solve a version of
Bertrand&rsquo;s paradox due to von Mises (1928 [1981]); see Jaynes
(1973: sec. 8) for a reply and see Weisberg (2011: 510&ndash;511) for
discussion.</p>

<h3 id="PrinMaxiEntr">D. The Principle of Maximum Entropy</h3>

<p>
Core to objective Bayesianism is the focus on this epistemic virtue:
freedom from <em>overly strong/committal opinions</em> in the absence
of sufficient reason or supporting evidence. Following this idea,
Jaynes (1968) generalizes the Principle of Indifference to the
Principle of Maximum Entropy. Setting aside the technical details
about entropy, that principle can be informally stated as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li>

<p>
<em class="sc">The Principle of Maximum Entropy (Informal
Version).</em> Let \(S\) be the set of the coherent credence
assignments that one has no reason against at the beginning of
one&rsquo;s inquiry. Then one&rsquo;s prior credence assignment ought
to be,</p>

<ol type="i" class="subhang">

<li>the least committal one in \(S\) (if there exists a unique
one),</li>

<li>or one of the least committal ones in \(S\) (if there exist
multiple ones),</li>

<li>or a sufficiently noncommittal one in \(S\) (if for every element
of \(S\) there is always a less committal one in \(S\)).</li>
</ol> </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The full version of this principle supplements the above with the
standard measure of how committal a credence distribution is:
(<em>information</em>) <em>entropy</em>. The rough idea is that, if a
credence distribution over some possibilities has more entropy, this
distribution will look flatter and, intuitively, it is less
committal&mdash;expressing a weaker opinion. This intuitive
understanding of the concept of entropy is enough for the discussion
below. But details are available in the survey by Joyce (2011: sec.
2.1).</p>

<p>
Clauses (ii) and (iii) suggest that the Principle of Maximum Entropy
is <em>not</em> committed to impermissivist Bayesianism, the view that
there always exists a uniquely permissible prior. Clause (ii) is
needed because multiple credence distributions can share the same
entropy. Clause (iii) is needed for those who think that coherence
requires Countable Additivity. To see why, consider a countable set
\(\Omega\) of mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive possibilities.
The least committal (i.e., flattest) distribution of credences over
\(\Omega\) assigns 0 to each of those possibilities just like de
Finetti&rsquo;s Infinite Lottery
 (<a href="index-2.html#sec-countable">section 3.2</a>),
 so it violates Countable Additivity. Furthermore, of the probability
distributions over \(\Omega\) that satisfy Countable Additivity, there
is no such thing as the least committal (flattest) one. The reason is
roughly that, for any sequence of non-negative real numbers that sum
to one (such as a sequence that decays exponentially with a certain
rate), there always exists an alternative that is <em>flatter</em>
(such as a sequence that decays exponentially with a <em>slower</em>
rate). Therefore, if coherence requires Countable Additivity, no
coherent credence distribution over \(\Omega\) is least committal
(flattest), and hence clause (iii) is needed, as J. Williamson (2010)
emphasizes.</p>

<p>
There is a worry about the Maximum Entropy Principle: when this
principle is applied repeatedly across different times, it might
violate the Principle of Conditionalization. The following is a
putative counterexample due to Seidenfeld (1979). Suppose that the set
of the possibilities under consideration is \(\Omega = \{1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6\}\), and that the initial set of the coherent priors to choose
from, \(S_\textrm{old}\), is defined by</p>

<div class="indent">

<p class="center">
\(S_\textrm{old}\) = the set of the probability distributions \(\Cr\)
over \(\Omega\) such that</p> 

\[\sum_{x = 1}^{6} x\,\Cr\big(\{x\}\big) = 3.5.\]

</div>

<p>
The least committal (flattest) distribution in \(S_\textrm{old}\)
turns out to be the distribution \(\Cr_\textrm{old}\) that assigns
equal credences \(1/6\) to each of the six possibilities in
\(\Omega\). So, by the Maximum Entropy Principle, \(\Cr_\textrm{old}\)
is the uniquely permissible prior. Now, suppose that we receive new
evidence \(E = \{2, 4, 6\}\), the set of the even-numbered
possibilities. The result of conditionalizing the prior
\(\Cr_\textrm{old}\) on \(E\) is the credence distribution
\(\Cr_\textrm{new}\) that assigns equal credences \(1/3\) to the
even-numbered possibilities and credences 0 to the other
possibilities. But Seidenfeld (1979) argues that, after \(E\) is
received as new evidence, the updated set of the coherent priors to
choose from, \(S_\textrm{new}\), should be the initial set
\(S_\textrm{old}\) &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; by \(E\) in the following
sense:</p> 

\[S_\textrm{new} = S_\textrm{old} \cap \{\Cr: \Cr(E) = 1\}.\]

<p>
Now, if we apply the Principle of Maximum Entropy to
\(S_\textrm{new}\), the chosen posterior cannot be the one
\(\Cr_\textrm{new}\) obtained by conditionalization on \(E\). The
reason is that \(\Cr_\textrm{new}\) cannot be the least committal
(flattest) one in \(S_\textrm{new}\), for it is already not in
\(S_\textrm{old}\). (Indeed, \(\sum_{x = 1}^{6} x\,
\Cr_\textrm{new}\big(\{x\}\big) = 4 \neq 3.5\).) For a reply in favor
of objective Bayesianism, see J. Williamson (2010: ch. 4), who also
presents other influential challenges to the Maximum Entropy
Principle, together with his replies to them.</p>

<h3 id="ObjeBayeImpeBaye">E. Objective Bayesianism and Impermissive Bayesianism</h3>

<p>
Objective Bayesianism and impermissive Bayesianism, as characterized
in this entry, are two independent views&mdash;neither implies the
other. An impermissivist need not accept objective Bayesianism,
because she can refrain from endorsing any particular norm to single
out the uniquely permissible doxastic state, let alone endorsing the
Indifference Principle. An objective Bayesian need not accept
impermissivism, either. To see why, note that core to objective
Bayesianism is the Indifference Principle, whose normative
consequences depend crucially on an account of its inputs, i.e., what
counts as insufficient reason or evidential symmetry (recall the
discussion of &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo;). So the
Indifference Principle may be rendered too weak to single out a unique
prior. For example, Carnap&rsquo;s (1963) version of the Indifference
Principle permits a continuum of different priors, corresponding to
stronger or weaker tendencies to infer inductively. Even when the
Indifference Principle is generalized to the Principle of Maximum
Entropy, it is still not committed to impermissivism; see
 <a href="#sec-max-ent">supplement D</a>
 for an explanation.</p>

<p>
That said, objective Bayesians tend to be sympathetic to
impermissivism. Perhaps this is because some motivations of the
Indifference Principle lead naturally (although not necessarily) to
impermissivism. For an example of such a motivation, think of the
Humean thesis that one&rsquo;s beliefs ought to be proportioned to
one&rsquo;s evidence (Hume 1748/1777: sec. 10, part 1). Now, let that
plausible-sounding Humean thesis be developed as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><em class="sc">A Humean Thesis Reformulated.</em> One&rsquo;s
credence in a proposition ought to be equal to <em>the</em> degree to
which that proposition is supported by one&rsquo;s total
evidence.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
This thesis motivates a version of the Indifference Principle (that
equally supported hypotheses ought to be assigned equal credences).
But the same thesis also implies impermissivism if we take seriously
the italicized &lsquo;the&rsquo; therein, which presupposes that there
exists a uniquely correct relation of evidential support. So
Schoenfield (2014) argues that, if there is more than one correct
relation of evidential support, the above line of motivation will lead
to permissivism instead.</p>
</div>

<div id="sec-shimony">

<h3 id="ShimQualCond">F. Shimony&rsquo;s Qualification of Conditionalization</h3>

<p>
Another way to qualify the Principle of Conditionalization is
suggested by Shimony (1970):</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><em class="sc">The Principle of Conditionalization (Matching
Version).</em> It ought to be that, upon learning \(E\), one&rsquo;s
new credence in \(H\) be made to match one&rsquo;s prior conditional
credence in \(H\) given \(E\), if the latter exists.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Note how this is immune from the Physics Student Case: the student did
not think of the logical claim \(E_\textrm{logical}\) before, let alone had a conditional credence given that claim&mdash;so the
if-clause is not satisfied. In that case, there is simply nothing for
the new credence to match.</p>
</div>

<div id="sec-jeffrey-general">

<h3 id="JeffCondGeneForm">G. Jeffrey Conditionalization: A General Formulation</h3>

<p>
In the main text Jeffrey conditionalization is stated with respect to
an evidential proposition \(E\), but it is often stated more generally
with respect to a finite partition \(\{E_i : i = 1, \ldots, n\}\) of
propositions (which are by definition mutually exclusive and jointly
exhaustive):</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li>

<p>
<em class="sc">The Principle of Jeffrey Conditionalization.</em> It
ought to be that, whenever the immediate effect of the experience that
one just received is a change of the credences in the elements of a
finite partition \(\{E_i : i = 1, \ldots, n\}\) and those credences
were all nonzero right before the change, then one&rsquo;s credence
change from \(\Cr\) to \(\Cr_\textrm{new}\) meet any one of the
following equivalent conditions:</p>

<dl class="sentag subhang">
<dt>(1) </dt>
<dd>for each partition element \(E_i\) whose new credence is (still)
nonzero, the credence ratios of the propositions that each entail
\(E_i\) are preserved from \(\Cr\) to \(\Cr_\textrm{new}\),</dd>
</dl>

<p class="subhang" style="margin-top:10pt">
or equivalently,</p>

<dl class="sentag subhang">
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>for each partition element \(E_i\) whose new credence is (still)
nonzero, the conditional credences given \(E_i\) are preserved from
\(\Cr\) to \(\Cr_\textrm{new}\),</dd>
</dl>

<p class="subhang" style="margin-top:10pt">
or equivalently,</p> 

\[
\begin{align}
\Cr(X) &amp;= \sum_{i = 1}^{n}  \underbrace{\Cr(X \mid E_i)}_\textrm{held constant} \wcdot \Cr(E_i)\\
&amp;\downarrow\\
\underbrace{\Cr_\textrm{new}(X)}_{\substack{\textrm{new weighted}\\ \textrm{average}}} &amp;= \sum_{i = 1}^{n}  \underbrace{\Cr(X \mid E_i)}_\textrm{held constant} \cdot \underbrace{\Cr_\textrm{new}(E_i)}_\textrm{new weight}
\end{align}\tag{3}
\]

 </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The equivalence among the three formulations (1)&ndash;(3) assumes
Probabilism and the Ratio Formula. In formulation (3), the prior
credence \(\Cr(X)\) is expressed as a weighted average of some
conditional credences, and the credence change is expressed as a
change <em>only</em> in the weights, holding the conditional credences
constant.</p>
</div> 

<div id="sec-proof-weisberg">

<h3 id="ProoResuAbouRedJellBean">H. Proof of the Result about the Red Jelly Bean</h3>

<p>
To prove Weisberg&rsquo;s (2009b) result about the Red Jelly Bean
Case, that it cannot be accommodated by Jeffrey conditionalization, we
need a bit of elementary probability theory:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li>

<p>
<em class="sc">Proposition (Symmetry of Independence)</em> Suppose
that \(\Cr\) is probabilistic, that \(\Cr(A)\) and \(\Cr(B)\) lie
strictly between 0 and 1, and that the Ratio Formula holds. Then the
following conditions are equivalent:</p> 

      \[\begin{align}
\Cr(A \mid B) &amp; = \Cr(A)\tag{1}\\
\Cr(B \mid A) &amp; = \Cr(B \mid \neg A)\tag{2}\\
\Cr(A \mid B) &amp; = \Cr(A \mid \neg B)\tag{3}\\
\end{align}
\]

 </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Any of those three clauses can be used to define the independence
between propositions \(A\) and \(B\) with respect to credence
assignment \(\Cr\). Now, assume the following two conditions from the
Red Jelly Bean Case:</p> 

\[
\begin{align}
\Cr_\textrm{new}( \textsf{red} \mid \textsf{tricky} ) &amp; &lt; \Cr_\textrm{new}( \textsf{red} )\tag{a}\\
\Cr_\textrm{old}( \textsf{red} \mid \textsf{tricky} )    &amp; = \Cr_\textrm{old}( \textsf{red} )\tag{b}\\
\end{align}
\]

<p>
Suppose, for <em>reductio</em>, that \(\Cr_\textrm{old}\) is obtained
from \(\Cr_\textrm{old}\) by a Jeffrey conditionalization on
\(\textsf{red}\). Then (b) implies the following, by (1)
\(\Rightarrow\) (2):</p> 

\[   \Cr_\textrm{old}( \textsf{tricky} \mid \textsf{red} ) = \Cr_\textrm{old}( \textsf{tricky} \mid \neg\textsf{red} ) .
   \]

<p>
That implies the following, thanks to the conditional credences
preserved by Jeffrey conditionalization on \(\textsf{red}\):</p>

\[    \Cr_\textrm{new}( \textsf{tricky} \mid \textsf{red} ) = \Cr_\textrm{new}( \textsf{tricky} \mid \neg\textsf{red} ).
\]

<p>
That implies the following, by (2) \(\Rightarrow\) (3):</p>

\[
    \Cr_\textrm{new}( \textsf{red} \mid \textsf{tricky} ) = \Cr_\textrm{new}( \textsf{red} \mid \neg\textsf{tricky} ).
   \]

<p>
That implies the following, by (3) \(\Rightarrow\) (1):</p>

\[
    \Cr_\textrm{new}( \textsf{red} \mid \textsf{tricky} ) = \Cr_\textrm{new}( \textsf{red}).
   \]

<p>
But this result contradicts (a), as desired.</p>

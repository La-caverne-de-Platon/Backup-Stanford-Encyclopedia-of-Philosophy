<h3><a name="Ari">1. Aristotle</a></h3>

<p>
Aristotle&rsquo;s preferred term for the emotions was <em>pathos</em>
[pl. <em>path&emacr;</em>], which makes the emotions largely passive
states, located within a general metaphysical landscape contrasting
active and passive, form and matter, and actuality and potentiality.
The <em>path&emacr;</em> are first and foremost responses found in the
embodied animal to the outside world, very much like perceptions. They
can thus be associated broadly with matter insofar as they represent
capacities or potentialities that need to be actualized by external
causes, which also explains how they are directed at objects. Of
course, the <em>path&emacr;</em> are not pure potentialities. They are
actualized in the experience of an occurrent emotion, and even the
mere capacity to experience <em>path&emacr;</em> requires a determinate
form, a soul. Moreover, the <em>path&emacr;</em> have close connections to
action, and Aristotle treated them as movements of a sort. For all
these reasons, the <em>path&emacr;</em> can be attributed to the soul
insofar as the soul informs a body. Yet since their causes lie outside
of the animal who experiences them, the question arises whether and to
what extent we can control them.</p>

<p>
That is a question addressed in several different ways by the most
important Aristotelean texts on the <em>path&emacr;</em> available to later
ancient and medieval authors: the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> and
<em>Rhetoric</em>. Each work presents lists of emotions, although
where the <em>Nichomachean Ethics</em> serves up 11, the
<em>Rhetoric</em> dishes out a full 14. They differ too in their aims
and tenor: the <em>Nichomachean Ethics</em> is concerned with the
place of the <em>path&emacr;</em> within the economy of acting according to
our habits and desires as moderated by reason, whereas the
<em>Rhetoric</em> concerns the arousal and management of
<em>path&emacr;</em> in the context of producing persuasion. In both cases,
however, the <em>path&emacr;</em> are treated as susceptible to rational
influence and voluntary action, although not directly subject to
choice.</p>

<p>
The <em>Nichomachean Ethics</em> characterizes <em>path&emacr;</em> as the
&ldquo;feelings accompanied by pleasure or pain,&rdquo; listing
appetite, anger, fear, confidence, envy, joy, love, hatred, longing,
emulation, and pity as examples (1105b21). Nonetheless, it will be
easiest, as well as consistent with the bulk of Aristotle&rsquo;s
analyses, to treat <em>pathos</em> as more or less equivalent to
desire, or appetite in the broad sense. (The <em>Rhetoric</em> makes
the identification explicit, e.g., at 1378a31. The <em>path&emacr;</em>
form one of the three main categories found in the soul, distinguished
from faculties, on the one hand, and states [<em>hexeis</em>], on the
other. They are, however, very closely associated with the latter.
States constitute the virtues [<em>aretea</em>] or vices of the
non-rational part of the soul, which can, however, either conform to
or violate right reason. They do so through their connections with
actions. The <em>path&emacr;</em>, along with the appetites, motivate
action (even to the point of provoking bodily changes such as internal
temperature, color and expression). The dispositions to feel them in
certain ways are, in turn, shaped by our habits of action, and states
may be understood as the dispositions to feel particular kinds of
<em>path&emacr;</em> on certain occasions. States are, in fact, &ldquo;the
things in virtue of which we stand well or badly with reference to the
passions [<em>path&emacr;</em>]&rdquo; (1105b26).</p>

<p>
The <em>path&emacr;</em> are not themselves virtues or vices. But states
are, and that means that the <em>path&emacr;</em> are morally significant.
More generally, because emotional experience is intrinsic to any life,
any account of the good life must give them their due. Now, certain
<em>path&emacr;</em> (spite, envy) are always bad. But despite
characterizing the human good as a life exercising &ldquo;activity of
the soul in conformity with excellence [or virtue]&rdquo; (1098a16),
and despite counting reason (but not feeling <em>path&emacr;</em>) as a
distinctively human activity, Aristotle took the excellence of the
excellent human to consist partly in experiencing <em>path&emacr;</em> in
the right way, to the right extent, and on the right occasions.
Indeed, the cultivation of character is largely a matter of
cultivating the disposition for appropriate experience of the
<em>path&emacr;</em>, which is as important as developing our abilities for
deliberative reason. The appropriate emotional dispositions may, in
fact, be even more crucial to the good life, since our capacity to
feel the passions seems intrinsic, while our ability to reason
develops with maturity and can be crucially affected by our emotional
dispositions. In any case, the truly excellent person will not only
reason well about what to do in particular situations, but will feel
the appropriate desires and <em>path&emacr;</em> in those situations. For
this reason, the intellectual virtue for deliberating about what to
do, <em>phroneasis</em>, is distinguished from the other practical
intellectual virtue of <em>technea</em> in part by its involvement
with <em>path&emacr;</em>.</p>

<p>
This comfortable relation between the emotions and reason, however,
hits some snags when Aristotle turned to the distinctive ways in which
we can fail to act well. For example, the <em>akratic</em>, or
weak-willed person, recognizes what should be done without actually
doing it. Aristotle&rsquo;s solution to this puzzling, if common,
phenomenon, was to lay the blame at the feet of some <em>pathos</em>,
particularly the <em>path&emacr;</em> of either anger or pleasure. Here
these <em>path&emacr;</em> might seem to oppose reason. Aristotle, however,
appears to have thought of them more as exercising a cognitive
interference that disrupts our completion of the practical syllogism
than as an external force overturning our otherwise smoothly operating
reason. (For this reason, the <em>path&emacr;</em> seem to have cognitive
aspects themselves; see Kraut 2005). In contrast, the
<em>enkratic</em> person feels the same disruptive <em>pathos</em>,
but does not give way to them in action. The <em>enkratic</em> is thus
superior to the <em>akratic</em>, but still not as admirable as the
person who feels the <em>path&emacr;</em> as the virtuous person would,
that is, in accord with the dictates of right reason. So
Aristotle&rsquo;s ethical works treat the <em>path&emacr;</em> both as
susceptible to reason and as integral to the good life, even as they
allow that the emotions can impair our reason.</p>

<p>
The risk of emotional disruption of our reason and the management of
the emotions are topics explored much further in the
<em>Rhetoric</em>. That Aristotle would even consider the topic is
noteworthy, for it suggests that techniques for producing belief,
among which appeals to emotion are prominent, need not be relegated to
sophistry, but make a proper subject for philosophy. Things seem a bit
less rosy, however, when we turn to the three distinct sources of
persuasion Aristotle admitted: trust in the character of the speaker,
the passions of the audience, and the &ldquo;proof, or apparent proof,
provided by the words of the speech [<em>logos</em>] itself&rdquo;
(1356a4). The first and last seem sources that are themselves reasons
&ndash; either reasons for holding it probable that the speaker&rsquo;s
conclusions are true, or reasons for the conclusion itself. But
arousing the audience&rsquo;s passions seems another matter altogether.
Indeed, Aristotle here characterized the <em>path&emacr;</em> as &ldquo;all
those feelings that so change men as to affect their judgments, and
that are also attended by pain and pleasure&rdquo; (1378a21), for
which he produces the example of anger, exactly the interfering
<em>pathos</em> held responsible for many cases of <em>akrasia</em>.
But despite the acknowledged risk that the <em>path&emacr;</em> can be used
for sophistic ends, warping our beliefs and decisions and producing
commitments on indefensible grounds, Aristotle did not hold that all
emotional appeals must do so. The problem with sophistic rhetoric is
that it makes its emotional pitch in ways independent of the subject
under discussion, perhaps even distracting from the subject at hand
(e.g., by invoking anger at Al Qaeda, while considering the merits of
invading Iraq). Presumably, however, a particular subject may have
characteristics that themselves provoke certain emotions, indeed that
<em>should</em> provoke certain emotions, and appropriate rhetoric
will highlight those features without ever leaving the subject at
hand. In this respect, the arousing of emotions might even count as a
kind of salience argument for the beliefs so produced (e.g., anger at
particular outrageous events can serve as a reason for believing that
a politician should be impeached).</p>

<p>
More generally, the <em>path&emacr;</em> pervade our lives; our judgments
are always affected by our emotions and moods, not just in perverse
and pernicious cases. In this respect, any rhetorician attempting to
produce belief must take account of the emotional state of her
audience. This is true whatever her motives might be. Aristotle
considered the true to be inherently, but not overridingly persuasive,
and so even the rhetorician most sincerely devoted to the truth will
need to consider how to manage the emotions of her audience so that it
will be amenable to belief in truth. Doing so will require not only
some assessment of the character of the audience, but also a great
deal of insight into the nature and causes of the <em>path&emacr;</em>, and
Aristotle devoted much of Book II of the <em>Rhetoric</em> to a kind
of taxonomy and physiognomy of the emotions (thereby inaugurating what
was to become a popular sport). Aristotle&rsquo;s list is copious,
listing some 14 passions. Each receives an analysis of its causes
(qualities) and objects (persons) &ndash; which together provide a
complex intentional content for the emotion. Aristotle also described
the mental conditions under which a <em>pathos</em> is felt, that is
the relations between the person feeling it and that which provides
its content. But the list so produced is slightly odd, comprising
anger, calm, friendship, enmity, fear, confidence, shame,
shamelessness, kindness, unkindness, pity, indignation, envy, and
emulation. Presumably, Aristotle thought that these were the
<em>path&emacr;</em> most likely to be of use to the rhetorician (even if
one ought not raise envy or shamelessness in an audience), but there
seems little other rhyme or reason to the selection, and no reason to
think that it is comprehensive (especially since it excludes
<em>path&emacr;</em> enumerated in the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>). One
notable organizing feature is Aristotle&rsquo;s assumption that the
<em>path&emacr;</em> fall into contrasting pairs, although it may be a bit
of a stretch to see the contrast between, e.g., envy and emulation, or
to take certain candidates, e.g., calm, as a full-fledged
<em>pathos</em>. Also interesting is Aristotle&rsquo;s discussion of how
the general psychology of the emotions will map onto different types
of character, ages, and fortunes, again a topic he might have
considered particularly useful for the rhetorician.</p>

<p>
So Aristotle&rsquo;s assessment of the <em>path&emacr;</em> is mixed: they
can be cultivated by reason and figure in the good life; they can also
disrupt our reason and action, and be used for nefarious ends. Indeed,
by rendering our judgments unstable and prone to conflict, the
emotions may pose a basic threat to human social life. But whether
happy or dangerous, Aristotle certainly thought that the emotions are
a fixture of human life that cannot be ignored. Ethics cultivates them
in developing character; rhetoric manages them to produce belief. To
these techniques, we might also add the psychological discipline
accomplished by poetry, particularly tragedy. The notion of
<em>katharsis</em>, or &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; of the unpleasant
emotions of pity and fear may be the most famous part of
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Poetics</em>, although the text mentions it only
in passing. It did not, in fact, have much influence on literature and
aesthetic theory through the seventeenth century (although the
<em>Poetics</em> was an important model in other respects, especially
for considering how emotional responses could be directed at different
kinds of characters). However, starting in the eighteenth century, the
notion of <em>katharsis</em> gained ground, particularly since it
addressed a question of enormous importance to 18<sup>th</sup> century
aesthetics, namely how something like tragedy, which would seem to
revolve around situations invoking unpleasant emotions, can
nonetheless be enjoyable. The notion of <em>katharsis</em> at least
hints at the complex and multivalent emotional states that would be
further analyzed by later theorists such as Hume.</p>

<h3><a name="StoCicSen">2. Stoicism, Cicero and Seneca</a></h3>

<p>
Compared with Aristotle&rsquo;s moderation, the Stoics seem pretty
intolerant of the <em>path&emacr;</em>, stressing their cognitive,
eudaimonistic, and moral failings, while recommending their
elimination. The Stoic evaluation of the passions was extremely
influential &ndash; and contentious &ndash; for later authors,
particularly among the seventeenth-century neo-Stoics, as well as
among those authors interested in defending the value of the passions.
Stoicism&rsquo;s thoroughgoing naturalism also made it a force to be
reckoned with for cutting-edge 17<sup>th</sup> century philosophers.
Since Stoic doctrines were largely transmitted to early modern
philosophers through the writings of Cicero and Seneca, it is mainly
the views current in late, Roman stoicism that matter for our
purposes. But these sources sometimes mixed up specifically Stoic
doctrines with views taken from other schools, particularly with
skepticism in Cicero&rsquo;s <em>De Finibus bonorum et malorum</em>.</p>

<p>
Like Aristotle, the Stoics also spoke of <em>path&emacr;</em> and located
them within the passive, material element of the universe. This
feature of the concept was emphasized by Cicero, who in
&ldquo;teaching philosophy to speak Latin,&rdquo; considered how to
translate the Greek term <em>pathos</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
I might have rendered this literally, styled them
&lsquo;diseases,&rsquo; but the word &lsquo;disease&rsquo; would not
suit all instances; for example, no one speaks of pity, nor yet anger,
as a disease, though the Greeks term these <em>pathos</em>. Let us
then accept the word &lsquo;emotion&rsquo; [<em>perturbatio</em>] the
very sound of which seems to denote something vicious and these
emotions are not excited by any natural influence. (<em>De
Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</em> 255)
</blockquote>

<p>
Following Cicero, Roman Stoics frequently translated <em>pathos</em>
as <em>perturbatio</em>, which came to have a particularly negative
ring. Seneca used <em>affectus</em>, while others preferred
<em>passio</em>, which explicitly connected the emotions with
&lsquo;undergoing,&rsquo; or &lsquo;suffering&rsquo; (Levi 1964, 14&ndash;5,
also Meyer 2000, 60). All of these translations, however, emphasized
passivity, particularly the <em>psychological</em> passivity of the
emotions and the sense in which they are out of our voluntary control,
and indeed not a proper part of ourselves.</p>

<p>
In its most austere form (which probably borrowed greatly from the
Cynics, and came to be associated with Cynicism), Stoic ethics
identifies the good life with virtue and both the good life and virtue
with self-sufficiency, i.e., that which is intrinsically good, proper
to us and fully within our control. The passions, however, are
responses to external events, outside of our control, and so
antithetical to virtue and happiness. To be prey to the passions is to
violate the basic outlines of our nature &ndash; indeed of the
rational shape of nature as a whole, to which we should submit as law
and fate. Such is the lot of most of us, which on Stoic reckoning
makes us thoroughly and equally vicious, although for reasons outside
of our control. A genuine sage, however, would achieve a state of
<em>apatheia</em>, or what Cicero calls <em>tranquillitas</em>, the
absence of alien <em>path&emacr;</em>. That state is the virtue and good
life to which we all aspire, although only the sage achieves it, and
sages are (at best) few and far between.</p>

<p>
But our situation may not be quite as hopeless as the emphasis on the
ungovernable and alien character of the passions might make it seem.
For the Stoics did not simply see the passions as brute reactions to
external events, but as cognitive responses, judgments about the
nature and value of various (present or future) states of affairs.
(For this reason, both Cicero and Seneca held that animals do not
experience genuine passions.) To be prey to the passions is to form
judgments that overvalue those states of affairs &ndash; that are, in
effect, false judgments of value and misplaced commitments. And
although nobody chooses to make mistakes, our judgments are not
completely out of our control. We can practice certain kinds of mental
discipline to increase our capacity to judge correctly, decrease our
capacity to be overwhelmed by the passions, and in effect, come to
gain control of ourselves.</p>

<p>
Following the early Stoics, Cicero enumerated and organized the
emotions into four basic categories: fear [<em>metus</em>]; pain,
distress, sorrow or even sickness [<em>aegritudo</em>]; lust, desire
or appetite [<em>libido</em>]; and pleasure or delight
[<em>laetitia</em>, translating the Greek <em>headonea</em>]. The
basis for this organization is the kinds of things under evaluation
and the nature of the judgment. <em>Aegritudo</em> is a (false)
evaluation of present things as bad, while <em>libido</em> is an
equally flawed evaluation of future, or absent things as good. These
evaluations are mistaken, since only virtue is intrinsically good,
whereas the things that are the objects of these emotions are
themselves &ldquo;indifferent&rdquo; (although they may be
&ldquo;preferred&rdquo; or &ldquo;dispreferred&rdquo;). There are a
number of subspecies of these broad categories. For instance, Seneca
identified anger as a species of desire, desire for revenge. The
imposition of an organizing schema on the proliferation of emotions
made them more manageable, a feature that would appeal greatly to
later authors, and highlighted their evaluative and cognitive content.
But the emotions are not solely cognitive; they are soul states, and
the Stoics held that the soul was itself a particular tensioning of
the material <em>pneuma</em>, part of the &ldquo;breath,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;wind&rdquo; that ran through and gave form to everything in the
world. Corresponding to the four categories of emotions would thus be
corresponding material states of the <em>pneuma</em>. These states may
endure even after we correct our judgments.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the Stoic view of the emotions was not relentlessly
gloomy. Despite the description of the sage as in a state of
<em>apatheia</em>, the Stoics also allowed that the sage can
experience <em>eupatheia</em>, good feelings. These are affective
states, but supposedly different in kind from the genuine passions and
without their cognitive, moral, and metaphysical failings. Instead of
over-evaluations of and reactions to indifferent, alien features of
the external world, <em>eupatheia</em> are cognitively appropriate
(and active) judgments directed at the things that are truly important
to the good life, particularly at other rational beings. In
Cicero&rsquo;s terminology, the sage replaces &lsquo;appetite&rsquo;
with &lsquo;wish&rsquo; [<em>voluntas</em>], including kindness,
generosity, warmth, and affection. Instead of feeling fear or
hedonistic pleasure, the sage experiences &lsquo;watchfulness&rsquo;
[<em>cautio</em>] or joy [<em>gaudium</em>]. No <em>eupatheia</em>,
however, correspond to pain. In contrast to the pneumatic aspects of
the passions, <em>eupatheia</em>, such as kindness, involve a
&ldquo;moderate and reasonable stretching or expansion of the
soul&rdquo; (Baltzly 2004, sec. 5).</p>

<p>
For all its austerity, the Stoic conception of virtue, the good life,
and happiness owed a great deal to the notion of a healthy,
well-functioning organism, one that lives in accord with its nature
and the nature of things. This is not simply metaphorical: important
concepts (such as <em>pneuma</em>) were heavily indebted to
Hellenistic medical traditions. Even more, Stoic materialism allowed
emotional disturbances, vice and unhappiness to be understood equally
well as disturbances in the attunement of the body. Nonetheless, the
best remedies may be cognitive: indeed, in his <em>Tusculan
Disputations</em>, Cicero argued for the therapeutic value of
philosophy itself, for its role as the medicine of the soul &ndash; a
point appreciated by later authors such as Descartes who goes so far
as to recommend reading Seneca for treating sadness <em>and</em> a low
fever.</p>

<h3><a name="HipGalMed">3. Hippocratic and Galenist Medicine</a></h3>

<p>
Similar views were expressed by Galen in such works as <em>The Best
Doctor is also a Philosopher</em>. Galen adopted many Stoic physical,
metaphysical, epistemological and ethical views on the
<em>path&emacr;</em>. But he also drew off an independent Hippocratic
tradition for treating the humours and the physiology of the emotions
and produced an influential account of the &ldquo;spirits.&rdquo;
Whereas most early Stoics adopted a unitary view of the soul, Galen
favored Plato&rsquo;s tri-partite model, for which he assigned various
functions to different parts of the body. Reason is located in the
brain, emotion (particularly anger) in the heart, and desire in the
liver. Each of these organs produces particular spirits, the substance
of which was a rarified fluid constituted of blood and
<em>pneuma</em>, and which governed specific biological functions
(sense perception and movement, blood flow and bodily temperature; and
nutrition and metabolism). Galen&rsquo;s map thus provided a
physiological basis for what became a commonplace distinction between
&lsquo;angry&rsquo; (irascible) emotions directed at overcoming
obstacles, and simple &lsquo;desiring&rsquo; (concupiscible) emotions
(see the discussion of Aquinas below). The humours were also assigned
to specific organs. Galen&rsquo;s approach was strongly teleological,
assigning each location a specific function and requiring balance for
the proper functioning of the whole. Disease occurs when some crucial
function is blocked, which can disturb the balance between the
humours. Each humour &ndash; physical substances such as bile (or
choler), black bile, phlegm, and blood &ndash; is distinguished by its
determinate qualities (associated with the four elements) of either
heat or cold, and either moisture or dryness. For example, blood,
which is warm and moist, is produced by the liver, whereas black bile
is both cold and dry, and originates in the spleen. Losing the
appropriate balance between such humours will produce a specific
temperament, which can be diagnosed and treated according to which
qualities dominate and the bodily origins of the relevant humours.
Temperaments are conditions conceived as both something like
personality and something like mood disorders, as well as bodily
dispositions to particular illnesses. Particular temperaments are
determined by the combinatorial possibilities of imbalanced elemental
qualities (Galen enumerates eight in <em>de Temperamentis</em>), but
the most famous are those associated with the dominance of a single
humor: sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, or melancholic. Treatment aims
to bring the humours, and hence the qualities, back into balance, and
can proceed in any number of ways &ndash; from diet, to changes of
climate, to bloodletting &ndash; that will either eliminate
superfluous humours, or introduce opposite qualities into the body.
Almost all of the many later authors who considered physiological
aspects of the emotions owe their basic framework to the Galenic and
Stoic traditions.</p>

<h3><a name="Epi">4. Epicureanism</a></h3>

<p>
Although the emotions as such were not a central topic for the
Epicureans, the presentation of their views on pleasure and the good
life through Diogenes Laertes, Lucretius, and even such critics as
Cicero (<em>De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</em>) were important enough
to early modern philosophers that they deserve some mention here.
Epicureans&rsquo; treatment of specific emotions, such as the fear of
death and the gods, or the desire for honor, typically strove to show
how they are baseless and destructive of the good life. But such
emotions rest on desires that are unnecessary, unnatural, or even
empty. Since the only good is pleasure [<em>headonea</em>] and the
absence of pain, and both pain and pleasure counted as
<em>path&emacr;</em>, the Epicureans did not dismiss passion as such from
the good life. Pleasures, however, come in many forms: short-term
pleasures, such as slaking a thirst, are &ldquo;kinetic,&rdquo; yet it
is &ldquo;static&rdquo; pleasures that yield the best cost-benefit
ratio for the quantity of pleasure and pain over the course of a life.
The highest form of static pleasure is the state of <em>ataraxia</em>,
freedom from disturbance, trouble, or anxiety, which is the mental
equivalent of bodily <em>aponia</em>, absence of pain. Mental
<em>ataraxia</em> remains closely tied to <em>aponia</em>, since our
mental attitude is largely focused on bodily experiences of pain and
pleasure. But mental pleasure is not limited to current bodily
experiences; for instance, much static pleasure can be derived by
recalling or anticipating various kinetic pleasures. In this respect,
the pleasures of the good life are not understood merely
negatively.</p>

<p>
In the seventeenth-century, Pierre Gassendi, and later Walter
Charleton presented the Epicurean view of pleasure as an appealing
alternative to Stoic austerity (Kraye 2003, 1293&ndash;8). Both, however,
had to do some fancy footwork to reconcile the Epicurean denial of
immortality with Christian doctrine and to overcome long-lasting
prejudices about the hedonistic immorality of Epicureanism. But few
others distinguished Epicureanism sharply from Stoicism. One hurdle to
recognizing the distinctive character of Epicureanism was that
<em>ataraxia</em> was often translated by the Latin
<em>tranquillitas</em>, which was also used for the <em>apatheia</em>
of the Stoics; then too, Pyrrhonian skeptics such as Sextus Empiricus
identified <em>ataraxia</em> with detachment from belief. Still, many
early modern philosophers endorsed a version of
&lsquo;tranquility&rsquo; that understood it to be a matter of
long-lasting emotional satisfaction, achieved by fulfilling moderate
desires, especially the desire for knowledge. In this respect, they
owed a great deal to Epicureanism, even if few acknowledged the
debt.</p>

<h3><a name="Aug">5. Augustine</a></h3>

<p>
Augustine introduced many themes that were influential for later
Christian writers, even as he borrowed from ancient theories such as
neo-Platonism. He typically chooses the Latin <em>passio</em> as his
translation of <em>path&emacr;</em>, reserving &ldquo;perturbations&rdquo;
for derogatory senses of <em>path&emacr;</em>. For as he explains, it would
be inappropriate to assign <em>passio</em> any particularly pejorative
meaning. <em>Passio</em> was, after all, the term applied to the
&ldquo;Passion&rdquo; of Christ, which was a kind of suffering, but
hardly a vicious, or even morally neutral, kind. (Levi 1964, 14&ndash;15.)
In general, Augustine did not disparage the emotions as such, despite
an increasingly tragic view of the human condition over the course of
his career.</p>

<p>
Augustine argued &ndash; somewhat ironically &ndash; that the Stoic
condemnation of the passions was more verbal than anything else, for
everyone admits that passions can be good. Augustine&rsquo;s quarrel
with the Stoic conception of virtue, vice, and the good life extended
beyond terminology, however, for he took the anti-Pelagian stance that
the good life is not a do-it-yourself project. The only true earthly
happiness lies in the hope of salvation and the eternal life of the
blessed, and that requires God&rsquo;s grace as a free gift. As such,
the Stoic emphasis on self-sufficiency and the ideal of
<em>apatheia</em> are wrong-headed from the start. Even unhappy
passions such as longing, pain, guilt, fear and mourning, have
enormous value for us, for &ldquo;so long as we wear the infirmity of
this life, we are rather worse men than better if we have none of
these emotions at all&rdquo; (<em>City of God</em> 14. 9). The most
important emotion for the good life is love, and virtue is nothing
other than the right kind of love, namely love of God.</p>

<p>
In yet another contrast to the Stoics, Augustine found the source of
vice and sin in something we might consider internal to our (fallen)
nature: namely, our free will, which together with memory and
understanding make up the &ldquo;trinity&rdquo; of the human mind.
Despite borrowing from Seneca, Augustine may have been the first
thinker to treat the will [<em>voluntas</em>] as a distinct faculty,
which is an essential part of the mind, yet can also oppose its
reason. For this reason, Augustine could account for the possibility
of <em>akrasia</em> quite handily, without having to import some
blindsiding and alien notion of interfering passion. As a separate
faculty, the will is active, identified as a &ldquo;movement of the
soul, under no compulsion, either toward getting or not losing
something&rdquo; (<em>On the Two Souls, against the Manicheans</em>
10.14). But on Augustine&rsquo;s view, the will simply incorporates the
passions into its attractive, hedonistic operations, as we can see in
his simplification of Cicero&rsquo;s classification:</p>

<blockquote>
Love which strains after the possession of the loved object is desire;
and the love which possesses and enjoys that object is joy. The love
that shuns what opposes it is fear, while the love that feels that
opposition when it happens is grief (<em>City of God</em> 14.7).
</blockquote>

<p>
The four basic kinds of passion are simply modifications of love,
which is both a passion and a form of willing. The proper kind of love
is also a virtue, indeed one of the three basic theological virtues,
along with hope and faith. Augustine distinguished between love of an
object for enjoyment (for its own sake) and love of an object for use,
which marks the difference between virtuous and vicious loves. Since
the only thing that is good for its own sake is God, only God is the
proper object of love as enjoyment. All virtuous loves are secondary
to this love: <em>caritas</em>, the will to unite with God. In
contrast, misplaced love, particularly self-love, is a different
species of passion, a will to the carnal, even a kind of lust
(<em>cupiditas</em>, or <em>concupiscentia</em>). But Augustine admits
links between the two kinds of love, noting that scripture often uses
the same term indifferently (<em>amor</em> or <em>dilectio</em>) for
both good and bad loves (<em>City of God</em> 14.7). Both show a
strong dash of an erotic drive towards union, although union with
quite different sorts of things. Augustine&rsquo;s neo-Platonic leanings
may show here in the thought that what distinguishes <em>caritas</em>
from vicious love is whether it is directed toward God or toward the
transient. Still, what makes the difference between virtuous and
vicious love is not an error of reason, but of will, especially when
we turn the love owed to God towards ourselves.</p>

<p>
Augustine did entertain sympathy for certain aspects of the ideal of
&ldquo;what the Greeks call <em>apatheia</em>, and what the Latins
would call, if their language would allow them,
<em>impassibilitas</em>,&rdquo; calling it &ldquo;obviously a good and
most desirable quality&rdquo; (<em>City of God</em> 14.9). At the same
time, he denied that it was either possible or desirable for humans on
earth and held that even the citizens of the city of God experience
the full panoply of passions. But the value he assigned to the
emotions may be largely instrumental, since even those
&ldquo;affections [that] are well regulated, and according to
God&rsquo;s will&rdquo; are &ldquo;peculiar to this life, not to that
future life we look for.&rdquo; In contrast, &ldquo;when there shall
be no sin in a man, then there shall be this <em>apatheia</em>&rdquo;
(<em>City of God</em> 14.9). Augustine understood <em>apatheia</em>,
however, to mean only &ldquo;a freedom from those emotions which are
contrary to reason and disturb the mind.&rdquo; Perfect happiness does
not involve the absence of all passions:</p>

<blockquote>
It may, indeed, reasonably be maintained that the perfect blessedness
we hope for shall be free from all sting of fear or sadness; but who
that is not quite lost to truth would say that neither love nor joy
shall be experienced there? (<em>City of God</em> 14.9).
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, the beatific vision pictures the saints as enjoying the
unalloyed pleasures of fulfilled love, free from all those constraints
necessary to keep earthly loves in line (<em>The Literal Meaning of
Genesis</em> XII.26.54). In the ideal of the blessed life of the
saved, Augustine introduces a new wrinkle in the old game of
evaluating the nature and worth of the passions.</p>

<h3><a name="Aqu">6. Aquinas</a></h3>

<p>
Perhaps the most recognizable point of reference, whether as model or
a source of contention, for early modern philosophers was Aquinas. His
treatment of the emotions appears mostly in the <em>Summa
Theologicae</em> II-1.22&ndash;48, although relevant material can also be
found in the ST I. 78.4 and I.80&ndash;81 and in <em>de Veritate</em>, q.
26. Aquinas himself assimilated many features of the accounts
we&rsquo;ve already seen in Aristotle, the Stoics, Cicero and Augustine,
as well as giving a distinctive spin to the notion of the passions,
particularly to those &ldquo;passions of the soul,&rdquo; which are
the emotions experienced by both humans and animals. These passions
are acts, or movements, of the sensitive appetitive power, which are
caused by external objects as apprehended by what Aquinas called the
&ldquo;estimative,&rdquo; or &ldquo;cogitative&rdquo; power. Passions
of the soul can also be identified with certain bodily changes,
including contraction or expansion of the &ldquo;spirits,&rdquo;
changes in the distribution of bodily temperature, and particularly
alterations in the movements of the heart.</p>

<p>
In the broadest sense, something is a passion if it involves some sort
of receptivity, as in sense-perception or understanding. But Aquinas
took passions of the soul to qualify as passions in a stricter sense,
involving change in the receptive subject (since receiving some X
requires losing its contrary). In the strictest sense, passions
involve change for the worse, which leads Aquinas to consider sorrow a
more exemplary passion than joy. For these reasons and despite calling
them passions of the soul, Aquinas held that passions belong to the
soul-body composite, for a body is required for something to undergo
change that can constitute corruption. Passions do indeed belong to
the soul as well, but &lsquo;accidentally,&rsquo; insofar as the soul
informs, and is a cause and end of the body (ST II-1.22). Aquinas
stressed in a number of places that God and angels have no passions,
although they do perform acts of will (rational appetites) comparable
to our passions in some respects. On the basis of the strict
understanding of the passions, Aquinas could distinguish them both
from the will, or rational appetitive faculty, and from any
apprehensive faculty (perception or understanding), since neither
undergoes the sort of change implicated in the passions. Passions are
instead located in the sensitive appetitive faculty; this is a faculty
that is passive, since it is moved by external causes (which are not
themselves moved thereby), although it may itself also be a mover.
Although they belong to an appetitive faculty, passions nonetheless
are initiated by acts of an apprehensive faculty, the estimative or
cogitative power. This faculty receives information about particulars.
But it differs from the faculties of sense-perception insofar as it
apprehends non-sensible properties, or <em>intentiones</em>,
particularly those that have some value pertinent to the apprehending
subject, such as the dangerousness of the wolf to a sheep, or the
usefulness of straw to a nesting bird. Quite generally, the faculty
presents sensible particulars as either good or evil. Although in
animals this &ldquo;estimative&rdquo; power is shaped by instinct, and
perhaps by experience, it is susceptible to reason in humans, so that
Aquinas called it the &ldquo;cogitative power&rdquo; and even &ndash;
somewhat oxymoronically &ndash; &ldquo;particular reason.&rdquo;
Still, he emphasized its corporeal nature, noting that &ldquo;medical
men assign a certain particular organ, namely the middle part of the
head&rdquo; to this faculty (ST I.78.4). Animal passions are
determined by what is apprehended by the estimative power, and in the
absence of any higher faculties that could overrule this power,
inevitably produce behavior. But the human cogitative power is
susceptible to reason, and thus so are human passions. For this
reason, human passions are subject to moral evaluation; they are good
if they are in accord with reason, and are thus
&ldquo;moderate,&rdquo; evil if they flout it, or are excessive.</p>

<p>
Despite his contention that in the strictest sense of the term,
passions involve a change for the worse, Aquinas did not think we are
necessarily worse off for being passionate creatures. Indeed, Aquinas
adopts a broadly teleological framework to explain the passions,
supposing that they exist to contribute to proper animal functioning:
&ldquo;as nature does not fail in necessary things, there must needs
be as many actions of the sensitive soul as may suffice for the life
of a perfect animal&rdquo; (ST I. 78.4) &ndash; that is, as will allow
the animal to survive and flourish. Appetites work hand in hand with
apprehensive and motive faculties, so that an animal can move around
the world, seeking out what is good for it, while shunning what is
bad. Each has its particular functional role to play in the larger
teleological picture, and we can see why Aquinas stressed that the
passions are appetites, or more broadly movements (thereby differing
from, e.g., Albertus Magnus, who took passions to be qualities, see
Knuuttila 2004, 248). But his teleological framework is not restricted
simply to animal ends, or ends of the soul-body composite. For
instance, sorrow involves a bodily change for the worse, depressing
the spirits and the movements of the heart, prompting uncomfortable
shifts in body temperature, and generally impairing the functioning of
the body. Despite its costs for the embodied creature, sorrow can
nevertheless be quite a good thing, both because it motivates us to
avoid sin, and because it is more virtuous to feel sorrow in the face
of evil than not. Again, though, Aquinas adopted a basically
Aristotelean position: moderate passions are good and functional, but
excessive passions are not. Fear and sorrow controlled by reason serve
several different ends, but excessive fear or sorrow can be disabling.
In general, Aquinas&rsquo;s conception of the passions is characterized
by their place within an economy of receptive apprehensions, motivated
actions, and the fulfillment of ends. Many of his analyses of
individual passions look from their nature to their causes (including
their objects), and thence to their effects &ndash; and in the case of
sorrow to its remedies. Although he did not deny they exist, Aquinas
does not seem much interested in the affective, or phenomenological
aspects of emotions (see Knuuttila 2004, 249&ndash;52)</p>

<p>
Along with his teleological framework, Aquinas adopted a fairly
intricate and highly principled classificatory scheme. The most
important division is that between concupiscible and irascible
passions. This distinction predates Aquinas by a good while &ndash;
thought to stem from Plato&rsquo;s <em>Timaeus</em>, it was suggested by
Aristotle, used by Cicero, and given a physiological grounding by
Galen &ndash; but it came to be most closely associated with Aquinas.
On his reckoning, the important distinction arises from a difference
in objects: the concupiscible passions are directed at good or evil
<em>simpliciter</em>, while the irascible passions are directed to
good or evil considered as arduous. The irascible passions are thus
parasitic on the concupiscible, and come into play only when there
seems to be some impediment to the good or evil for which we feel
concupiscible passions of love or hatred. As did Plato before him,
Aquinas considered such distinctions to be necessary to account for
the psychic complexity and conflict that we often experience.</p>

<p>
Aquinas borrowed yet other principles from the Aristotelean
classification of physical motions to produce a taxonomy of eleven
basic kinds of passions. Crossing good and evil with three different
kinds of motion describing the movement of the appetite produces six
concupiscible passions: love [<em>amor</em>] and hate
[<em>odium</em>]; desire [<em>desiderium</em>,
<em>concupiscentia</em>] and aversion [<em>fuga</em>]; joy
[<em>delectatio</em>, or its internal sub-species, <em>gaudium</em>]
and pain [<em>dolor</em> and for internal pain, <em>tristitia</em>].
The specific irascible passions are produced by multiplying the nature
of their objects with the direction of the motions with respect to
those objects to produce the four passions of hope [<em>spes</em>] and
desperation [<em>desperatio</em>], fear [<em>timor</em>] and daring
[<em>audacia</em>]. To these, Aquinas added the rather special case of
anger [<em>ira</em>], which presupposes a concupiscible passion of
pain, and is a resolute appetite to remove the present source of pain.
Unlike Aristotle in the <em>Rhetoric</em>, Aquinas denied that anger
has a contrary. Although the results might seem a bit baroque, Aquinas
obviously put great stock into his taxonomy, considering it superior
to both Augustine&rsquo;s reduction of passions to love and Cicero&rsquo;s
scheme of four primary passions (although he goes to some pains to
interpret each view in a sympathetic way).</p>

<p>
Aquinas&rsquo;s evaluation of the emotions was a bit mixed. On the one
hand, moderate passions serve the ends of human and animal life.
Indeed they help constitute the ends of our lives, since the greatest
of human goods, happiness, involves pleasure. On the other hand,
Aquinas took passions in the strict sense to involve change for the
worse, and more generally, ranked passions with the passive and not
fully actualized entities existing on the lower, degraded rungs of his
ontological ladder. This is not merely a matter of ontological
imperfection. Aquinas stressed that God and the angels have no
passions; it is part of their happy condition that their only
appetites are the active, rational volitions that belong to their very
being. Still, those acts of will are analogous to many of our
emotions, e.g., love and anger, however much Aquinas balked at calling
them &lsquo;passions.&rsquo; He even insisted on occasion that it is
appropriate to give a rational appetite and a passion the same name
(e.g., &lsquo;love&rsquo;) on the grounds that they have similar
&ldquo;movements.&rdquo; So he does seem to have recognized
intellectual emotions or affects of some sort more
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo; than our passions. Moreover, passions proper
need not arise only by way of completely external causes; they can
arise through volitions, when the volition produces a bodily effect,
as when the intellect&rsquo;s raising something for consideration under
a universal prompts a particular appearance in the imagination (see
<em>de Veritate</em> q.26). Although Aquinas did not make much out of
these cases, they set an important precedent for future
discussions.</p>

<h3><a name="RenSixCenDis">7. Renaissance and Sixteenth Century Discussions</a></h3>

<h4><a name="FloHumMac">7.1 Florentine Humanism and Machiavelli</a></h4>

<p>
Compared to Aquinas, the writers of Florentine humanism considered the
emotions only unsystematically. Marcilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico
della Mirandola revitalized neo-Platonic approaches to the emotions,
especially through their discussions of &ldquo;Platonic love.&rdquo;
The <em>Prince</em> and <em>Discourses</em> of Niccol&oacute;
Machiavelli take a different approach in considering how to
characterize humans, particularly geographically specific groups of
humans, in terms of their emotional dispositions and the patterns of
behavior so motivated. Since he understood actions to be the outcomes
of emotions, Machiavelli&rsquo;s advice to political leaders included a
great deal of material on how to manipulate the passions of subjects
to keep public order. One technique is to adopt a public persona that
can project emotional and character traits, which may be quite
different from the ruler&rsquo;s true private passions. Throughout,
Machiavelli stressed that fear provides a particularly reliable
motivation, and envy a well-nigh universal one. But for all his
seemingly <em>realpolitik</em> public psychology, Machiavelli gave an
important, and normatively loaded, role to what he called
&ldquo;glory&rdquo; [<em>gloria</em>]. Glory may not itself be an
emotion &ndash; Machiavelli treated it as an achievement at which a
ruler should aim &ndash; but the desire for something like glory,
e.g., ambition, or the emotion for honor, was to become an important
element in the list of emotions recognized by figures from Montaigne
to Hobbes.</p>

<h4><a name="JuaLuiViv">7.2 Juan Luis Vives</a></h4>

<p>
Another figure with humanist connections was the lesser-known writer
on the emotions Juan Luis Vives. Book Three of his tome <em>De Anima
et Vita</em> (1538) treats psychology and education, and includes a
seminal discussion of the emotions, combining Galenist medicine with
observational material, particularly to show how the humour-laden
temperaments can be modified by such features as age, health, climate
and circumstance, as well as by thought, judgment and will (see
Guerlac 1998). Although he held that uncontrolled emotions can be
morally and cognitively disruptive, Vives did not suppose all emotions
to be so disruptive, and introduced vocabulary to distinguish such
emotions from violent passions. In so doing, he popularized the use of
&lsquo;<em>affectus</em>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<em>affectiones</em>,&rsquo;
which he understood most broadly as any modification (or accident),
more narrowly as an emotion in general, and in the narrowest sense as
a gentle emotion (see Gardiner 1970, 123). Other authors, however,
continued to use &lsquo;passion&rsquo; and &lsquo;affection&rsquo;
interchangeably, as did Thomas Wright in <em>The Passions of the Mind
in General</em> (1601).</p>

<p>
Despite evaluating it differently, Vives shared the Stoic view
connecting emotions and cognition. Vives took emotions to arise out of
judgments of good and evil. These judgments may not be reasoned or
deliberative, but he seemed to think that some judgment-like character
had to be attributed to emotions to explain exactly how they came to
be directed at objects. In this, he took issue with Aquinas, who took
differences in &ldquo;formal&rdquo; objects and causes to suffice for
distinguishing powers of the soul. But Vives generally refused to draw
sharp distinctions between the various powers and faculties of the
soul. Instead, he redrew Aquinas&rsquo;s classification of the emotions,
producing a threefold distinction of emotions directed at good,
emotions directed at, or concerned with evil [<em>ad malum</em>], and
those that act to combat evil (<em>contra malum</em>). This does not
eliminate the contrast between concupiscible and the irascible
passions, but it does produce a different taxonomy: there are affects
directed at good <em>simpliciter</em> (liking, love, reverence), as
well as at present good (delight), and at future good (desire, hope).
There are affects concerned with evil per se (e.g., dislike, hate),
and specifically with present evil (grief) or future evil (fear).
There are also affects combating present evil (anger, indignation) and
future evil (faith, daring). Moreover, emotions could interact,
whether by combining, conflicting, diminishing, or strengthening each
other to produce whole trains of emotions, or by falling into a fourth
category of &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; emotions, compounded out of simpler
ones (see Gardiner 1970, 129&ndash;130).</p>

<p>
In keeping with his medical interests and reliance on Galenist
psycho-physiology, Vives also placed a good deal of emphasis on the
physiological aspects of emotions. However, unlike many other
Renaissance Galenists, Vives did not assign emotions specifically to
the heart, but instead emphasized the interplay between emotions,
judgments of good and evil, and bodily states. Despite these
connections, Vives took it that the proper way to manage and control
the affects is by invoking other affects. These views, rather than his
peculiar taxonomies, mark his importance for later authors.</p>

<h4><a name="Mon">7.3 Montaigne</a></h4>

<p>
Michel de Montaigne&rsquo;s <em>Essais</em> are heavily indebted to
previous accounts of the emotions and their value. But it is hard to
say where exactly Montaigne stood on them. The <em>Essais</em> are far
from being a systematic work of philosophy, they are shot through with
irony, and they may well reflect Montaigne&rsquo;s changing views over
the many years he worked on them. Nonetheless, certain themes emerge,
particularly after the case made for Pyrrhonian skepticism in the
&ldquo;Apology for Raimond Sebond.&rdquo; There and elsewhere,
skeptical means serve roughly Stoic ends. Montaigne spoke approvingly
of how his brand of skepticism leads to a kind of
&ldquo;ataraxy:&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
a peaceful and sedate condition of life, exempt from the agitations we
receive through the impressions of the opinion and knowledge we think
we have of things. Whence are born fear, avarice, envy, immoderate
desires, ambition, pride, superstition, love of novelty, rebellion,
disobedience, obstinancy and most bodily ills (&ldquo;Apology for
Raymond Sebond,&rdquo; Montaigne 1958, 372).
</blockquote>

<p>
For all this condemnation of a whole host of passions, however,
Montaigne often condemned the &ldquo;harshness&rdquo; of the Stoics
with equal vehemence. And throughout the <em>Essais</em>, he shows a
keen interest in the affective components of education and
intellectual activity, taking pleasant emotions, particularly
&ldquo;cheerfulness&rdquo; [<em>esjouissance</em>] to be desirable
both in intellectual pursuits and as their achievement. Yet it would
be hard to attribute even a eudaimonistic position akin to
Aristotle&rsquo;s to the writer who in &ldquo;On Moderation&rdquo;
advised moderation even in pursuit of virtue and moderation.</p>

<p>
Montaigne&rsquo;s notion of cheerfulness seems to go hand in hand with
the sort of peaceful, retiring life he favored. He was particularly
hard on emotions that would disrupt such a life, producing a number of
diatribes (e.g., &ldquo;On Glory&rdquo;) against the desire for glory,
reputation, or honor. In contrast to Machiavelli, Montaigne conceived
of glory more as a matter of recognition or reputation than as a
normatively inflected achievement. It is transient and irrational, and
the desire for it is an &ldquo;illusion,&rdquo; although a universal
one, tempting even and especially to those who have succeeded in
controlling their other passions. With his tongue firmly in his cheek,
Montaigne remarked on how often those who have written books despising
glory still want the glory of having written the books (&ldquo;Of not
Communicating one&rsquo;s Glory,&rdquo; Montaigne 1958, 187). (The irony
of this criticism is only increased by its allusion to Cicero, who
serves as both example of the desire and source for the comment, see
<em>Pro Archia</em> XI,16.)</p>

<p>
In place of any general theory, Montaigne&rsquo;s essays draw from
various sources to present a plethora of anecdotal accounts, showing
everything from the effects emotions may have on reason and judgment,
to their bodily effects, to the continuity between human and animal
emotions. But what Montaigne seems most bent on is the sheer diversity
of the passions we experience, and in particular, what he called their
&ldquo;inconstancy&rdquo; &ndash; the fleeting and often conflicting
nature of the emotions an individual may experience on various
occasions (or even on one) (&ldquo;How we Cry and Laugh for the Same
Thing,&rdquo; Montaigne 1958, 173). The same can be said for our
judgment; changes of perspective can generate new and contrasting
passions and concomitant judgments (Montaigne 1958, 174). The
relativity of judgment is an old Pyrrhonist theme, used to generate
the problem of the criterion (by, e.g., Sextus Empiricus).
Montaigne&rsquo;s associate and follower, Pierre Charron uses the
relativity of passions to much the same end in his <em>De la
Sagesse</em> (1601). Montaigne, however, applied this chestnut here
specifically to the individual in order to draw a psychological moral:
&ldquo;&hellip; we are wrong to compose a continuous body out of all
this succession of feelings.&rdquo; (&ldquo;How we Cry and Laugh for
the Same Thing,&rdquo; Montaigne 1958, 174), for &ldquo;we are all
patchwork, and &hellip; shapeless and diverse in composition&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Of the Inconsistency of our Actions,&rdquo; Montaigne 1958,
244).</p>

<p>
But this is not merely patchwork inconstancy. Montaigne also
contrasted what is external with a kind of interiority that seems
associated with the true self. Intense emotions may not have outward
expressions, and perturbations that remain superficial do not touch
the true inner core. So too, virtuous actions can have vicious
motivations, and vice-versa. But even as Montaigne used this contrast,
he played with it, telling us that because &ldquo;a sound intellect
will refuse to judge men simply by their outward actions, we must
probe the inside and discover what springs set men in motion,&rdquo;
before adding &ldquo;but since this is an arduous and hazardous
undertaking, I wish fewer people would meddle with it&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Of the Inconsistency of our Actions,&rdquo; Montaigne 1958,
244). Difficult though it may be to reach the &ldquo;inside&rdquo;
directly, we should also note that the interior and exterior are
intertwined, a point Montaigne uses in discussing
&ldquo;diversion,&rdquo; the transformation of painful emotions into
pleasanter ones (&ldquo;Of Diversion&rdquo;). Diversion can be
accomplished simply through the outer expressions of emotion by
others. This is one reason why rhetoric can be an effective diversion
(much better than argument); indeed, it can change even the passions
of the speaker, as outward expression shapes inward affect (Montaigne
1958, 635). It is fortunate that we are susceptible to expressions of
emotion, since painful passions are much easier to divert than to
subdue. By using diversion to increase cheerfulness, we turn the
inconstancy of our emotional natures to our benefit. Although it may
be going too far to say that Montaigne celebrated such inconstancy, he
did seem to have seen it as a brute and interesting feature of human
(and animal) life. Nor did he feel any need to propose an account of
the structure of the soul that will impose a neat taxonomy on the
messy character of our emotions to explain away their <em>prima
facie</em> inconstancy and conflict.</p>

<h4><a name="JusLip">7.4 Justus Lipsius</a></h4>

<p>
Montaigne&rsquo;s work was contemporaneous with the revival movement
that came to be known as neo-Stoicism, which adopted ancient
(particularly Roman) Stoicism to Christian theology and contemporary
concerns. Perhaps the most famous neo-Stoic, one admired greatly by
Montaigne, was Justus Lipsius, who espoused neo-Stoic doctrines in
both ethics and political works, as well as in other areas of
philosophy. His most popular book was <em>On Constancy in Times of
Public Troubles</em> [<em>De Constantia in publicis malis</em>], often
shortened to <em>On Constancy</em>, first published in 1584, before
going through more than 80 editions and translations over the next two
centuries. Lipsius adopted a typically Stoic approach to the passions
and &ldquo;affects&rdquo; [<em>adfectus</em>], identifying them as
false opinions that we &ldquo;must never stop attempting to
conquer&rdquo; (<em>On Constancy</em> 1.2). The desirable state is
&ldquo;constancy,&rdquo; internal peace and absence of conflict.
Lipsius laid particular stress on the role of constancy during times
of tumultuous civic and religious change, something he experienced in
spades during the course of his career. Perhaps for this reason, he
included among the passions to be conquered such &ldquo;lures&rdquo;
as deception [<em>simulatio</em>], patriotism, and pity
[<em>miseratio</em>] for the misfortunes of others. The goal, however,
seems to be emotional detachment, not practical disengagement from
public affairs. As a companion piece to <em>On Constancy</em>, Lipsius
wrote <em>Six Books on Politics or Civil Doctrine</em>
[<em>Politicorum sive Civilis doctrinae libri sex</em>] (1589).
Whereas the &ldquo;Letter to the Reader&rdquo; of the earlier book
directed it at the citizenry who endure turmoil, the latter aimed to
instruct &ldquo;those who rule how to govern.&rdquo; Self-government
still plays a crucial role in government, though, and Lipsius
recommends a course in Stoic ethics as the best corrective for bad
leadership (see Papy 2004). Lipsius&rsquo;s work was thus part of the
burgeoning early modern tendency to locate the passions within issues
of command and government.</p>

<h4><a name="SuaLatSch">7.5 Suarez and Late Scholasticism</a></h4>

<p>
Cheek to jowl with the revival of ancient philosophies were continuing
Scholastic traditions that undertook to treat the emotions
systematically. Perhaps the most distinctive and influential writer of
this kind was Francesco Suarez, whose compendious works included
discussions of the emotions in V.iv-vi of his posthumously published
<em>Tractatus de Anima</em> (1621), and a commentary on the emotional
theory of Aquinas&rsquo;s <em>Summa</em> in IV, disputations 1 of his
<em>Tractatus quinque ad Primam Secundae D. Thomae Aquinatis</em>.
Suarez was no slavish follower of Aquinas, however. He attacked the
division between concupiscible and irascible passions, as resting
merely on a &ldquo;conceptual distinction,&rdquo; rather than marking
genuinely different powers and faculties in the soul. For this reason,
he took Aquinas&rsquo;s classification of the emotions into eleven basic
kinds to be unfounded, and instead considered several alternate
principles of distinction producing radically different
classifications, one of which consists merely of six contrasting
emotions. Ultimately, however, Suarez considers there to be no more
than a conceptual distinction between any passion and any other
passion. Suarez&rsquo;s position may be extreme, and he himself allows
that Aquinas&rsquo;s distinctions may be heuristically useful, but his
criticisms of the proliferation of distinct powers in the soul and his
drive to unify the account of the soul on the basis of its
&ldquo;intertwining&rdquo; powers struck a chord with many. Certainly
the distinction between the concupiscible and the irascible became
less of an article of faith, abandoned even by such synthesizing works
as the <em>Summa philosophiae quadripartita</em> (1609) of Eustace of
St. Paul (King 2002, 244, 256) &ndash; a work that served as one of
Descartes&rsquo;s main sources on scholasticism.</p>

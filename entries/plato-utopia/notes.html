 Also see
<em>Laws</em> 660Dff., 696B&ndash;697C and 742D&ndash;744A. Note that justice
includes wisdom <em>(phron&ecirc;sis</em>), 631C5&ndash;8. There will be
citizens, to be sure, in whom the law fails to instill the whole of
virtue, but Plato never suggests that the laws fail in the case of
every non-philosopher. Indeed, he expects that there will be quite a
few successes, see, e.g., <em>Laws</em> 630C, 631CD, 641BC, 647CD,
705E&ndash;706A, 707D, 731E&ndash;732B, 734E&ndash;735A, 742C&ndash;743C, 770C&ndash;771A, 790B,

945BE, 946E&ndash;947B, and 963A.</p>

<p>

The <em>Republic</em> (e.g. 419A&ndash;421C) holds that the goal of the
laws is to bring about the greatest possible happiness in the city. The
<em>Laws</em> (e.g., 631B3&ndash;6, 718B2&ndash;4, 743C5&ndash;6, 806C3&ndash;7) still holds
that the ultimate end of the legal system is to bring about the
greatest possible happiness in the city. This agreement between
the <em>Republic</em> and the <em>Laws</em> that the goal of the laws
is to make the city or its citizens as happy as possible is compatible
with the claim that such happiness is realized in quite different ways
in the two dialogues and, in particular, with the idea that they
disagree about whether non-philosophical citizens can be become
genuinely virtuous.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
Annas (1999, pp. 31&ndash;51)
argues that, in the <em>Laws</em>, virtue is the only component of
happiness. Bobonich (2002, pp. 210&ndash;215) disagrees, and gives a detailed
discussion of the options.</p>

There is some disagreement
about what precisely this model of the soul is meant to explain and,
thus, what range of psychic phenomena we can understand by reference to
this model. See e.g. Kamtekar (2010, p. 130) and Frede (2010, p. 118)
for suggestions that this model is not meant to capture all of
Plato&rsquo;s psychology in the <em>Laws</em>.</p>

Dorothea Frede suggests
(2010, p. 116) that &ldquo;puppet&rdquo; is a misleading translation if
it suggests that external forces pull the strings, and that Plato has
something like a wind-up toy in mind instead.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
There is, of course,
controversy over whether to take the division of the soul in the
<em>Republic</em> to involve agent-like parts or something more like
aspects. For those who take the <em>Republic</em> to be committed to
agent-like parts, however, the <em>Laws</em> Book 1 model will be
strikingly different. For discussion of partitioning, see Bobonich
(2002) and (2010), Lorenz (2006), Price (2009), and Barney, Brennan,
Brittain ed. (2012).</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Gregory Vlastos
(1981, p. 216), for example, suggests that Plato came to think in the
<em>Laws</em> that no one, not even a fully virtuous philosopher, could
hold autocratic power without being corrupted because of Plato&rsquo;s own
final encounter with Dionysus the Younger in Sicily. But this
explanation is unsatisfying. Even if Plato had thought that Dionysus
was well-brought up, fully virtuous, and possessed full philosophical
understanding, it would be rash to generalize from this one case to all
possible cases. But Plato thought that Dionysus was badly brought up
(<em>Epist. VII</em> 332CD) and had a low opinion of his philosophical
knowledge (<em>Epist. VII</em> 338D&ndash;339B, 340B&ndash;341B, 344D&ndash;345C).&nbsp;
(This assumes, for the sake of the argument, that the <em>Seventh
Letter</em> is genuine and that it gives us direct insight into Plato&rsquo;s
state of mind. On the latter point, see Annas (1999, pp. 72&ndash;7.)) It
would thus be irrational for Plato to generalize from his experience
with Dionysus to the capacities of all human beings. Dion would come
closer to Plato&rsquo;s ideal (although his early upbringing must have been
somewhat defective, <em>Epist. VII</em> 327B1&ndash;4) and Vlastos (1981, p.
216, n. 29) plausibly suggests that Plato did not think that Dion was
an autocrat corrupted by power, but was a good man who came to grief
because of his associates&rsquo; villainy (<em>Epist. VII</em> 351DE).</p>

For others who think that there are significant differences between the
<em>Republic</em> and the late dialogues on some important points,
especially the education of the citizens, see Cooper (1999, pp.
165&ndash;91), Irwin (1995, pp. 349&ndash;53) and the nuanced accounts of Laks
(1990), (2000). For a recent defense of a unitarian position on the relation between the <em>Republic</em> and the <em>Laws</em>, see Rowe (2010); for a defense of the idea that the non-philosophic citizens of the <em>Republic</em> (including those in the producer class) are happier than the non-philosophic citizens of the <em>Laws</em>, see Kraut (2010). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Plato&rsquo;s ranking
here is:&nbsp; in first place, full communism throughout the entire
citizen body; in second place, the constitution of Magnesia that they
are now describing (<em>Laws</em> 739E, 807B and 875D); in third place,
constitutions approximating the second best one in less favorable
circumstances. See Barker (1960, pp. 370&ndash;1 n. 2). The point that this
is not the ideal of the <em>Republic</em> was rightly noted long ago by
Natorp and recently reemphasized by Andr&eacute; Laks (2001). Barker&rsquo;s
(1960, p. 251 n. 1, pp. 370&ndash;1 n. 1) only reason for rejecting what he
agrees is the clear meaning of the text is that he cannot accept that
Plato could have a higher ideal than the <em>Republic</em>.</p>

 Some have
interpreted Plato to mean that the highest class has only between two
and three times the value of the lot, i.e. their total property taking
the notional value of the lot into account would be worth up to four
times the value of the lot. The interpretation that they may have
<em>movable assets</em> up to four times the value of the lot is held
by Aristotle (<em>Politics</em> 1265b22 and 1266b7) and is
convincingly argued for by Morrow (1960, p. 131 n. 112). This is
important, since the other interpretation reduces the lowest class to
the level of subsistence farmers and thus significantly reduces their
chances for political participation or leisurely activity. For an
important discussion of leisure in the <em>Laws</em>, see Samaras
(2012).</p>

The most striking
statement of such connection is given at 672E5, where the Athenian
Visitor claims that &ldquo;[i]n our view, choristry as a whole is
identical with education as a whole&rdquo;, but the idea that music and
poetry in particular have great educational importance recurs
throughout the work (see e.g. the Book 3 claim that the decline of
Athens started with the erosion of standards in music (<em>Laws</em>
700A&ndash;791B)).</p>

Plato regularly
expresses skepticism about cultural variation; see also, e.g.,
<em>Laws</em> 656D&ndash;657C for his praise of the Egyptians&rsquo; bans on
innovation in painting, sculpture, and music.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-42">

In contrasting the text
of the <em>Laws</em> with the poets, Plato claims that the constitution
(<em>politeia</em>) is an imitation (<em>mimesis</em>) of the finest
and best life and that it is &ldquo;the truest tragedy&rdquo;
(<em>Laws</em> 817B3&ndash;5). Andr&eacute; Laks&rsquo; &ldquo;Plato&rsquo;s
&lsquo;truest tragedy&rsquo;: <em>Laws</em> Book 7, 817a&ndash;d&rdquo;
undertakes to explain this fascinating claim, arguing, among other
things, that we should think that the inevitable conflict between
reason and pleasure and the resulting need for punishment in the state
are part of why the constitution is a tragedy. For another
interpretation of this claim, see Sauv&eacute; Meyer (2011).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-43">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-43">43.</a>
The claim that the
non-philosophers in the <em>Republic</em> don&rsquo;t achieve anything
approaching genuine virtue is, however, controversial. For a recent
defense of the claims that non-philosophers in the <em>Republic</em>
have a meaningful sort of ordinary virtue that nonetheless falls short
of full virtue, and that Plato&rsquo;s views of ordinary virtue in the
<em>Republic</em> and the <em>Laws</em> are importantly continuous, see
Kraut (2010). See also section 5 (Preludes in the <em>Laws</em>) for
further discussion.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-44">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-44">44.</a>
See Bobonich (2002, pp.
350&ndash;373) for a discussion of pleasure in the <em>Laws</em> which
advances this interpretation. Kamtekar (2010) accepts that
Bobonich&rsquo;s account gives us part of the reason for the centrality
of music and gymnastics in the educational program, but thinks that it
can&rsquo;t give us the whole story; she also emphasizes the effect
that they have on the non-rational parts of the soul, e.g. their
ability to engage with psychological affections which have become
separated from their associated beliefs. Morrow (1960, p. 305) also
takes the natural human pleasure in orderly movement to be crucial to
the explanation of the educational program but fits this into an
interpretation which focuses rather on the status of music and dance as
imitations of good and bad character.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-45">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-45">45.</a>
That there is some
important connection between value and order in the <em>Laws</em> is
suggested by, for example, Plato&rsquo;s willingness to infer from the
order in the heavens that the cause of that order must be &ldquo;good
with every virtue&rdquo; (<em>Laws</em> 899B6). Plato develops a more
explicit account of the connection between order and value in the
<em>Philebus</em> (26B5&ndash;C2) and seems to try to work it out in the
ethical context in the <em>Statesman</em>. See Bobonich (2002, pp.
206&ndash;9) for more discussion, including further references.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-46">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-46">46.</a>
For some internal
confirmation that the order perceived in music and dance is continuous
with that which is exhibited by the heavenly bodies, see <em>Laws</em>
967E; see also <em>Timaeus</em> 47B6&ndash;E2 for the claim that the order
exhibited in harmony is akin to that exhibited by the circular motion
in our souls. For more on the heavenly bodies and their divine status
see section 8 (Theology).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-47">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-47">47.</a>
Kamtekar (2010: 147)
raises as a worry for the completeness of this view that it does not
explain Plato&rsquo;s emphasis on <em>participation</em> in physical
activity; if coming to grasp the order in music and dance were the only
thing of ethical significance, she thinks, then seeing others perform
would be just as good. She thus suggests that this account needs to be
supplemented by an account of the way in which music and dance affect
the non-rational parts of the soul.</p>

Kamtekar (2010, p. 147)

A few lines later, soul
is said to be &ldquo;among the first things to have come into
being&rdquo; (892C4). This raises questions that go unanswered in the
subsequent discussion: what other things are among the first things? Is
anything prior to soul? See Mayhew (2010, pp. 212&ndash;213) for discussion,
including the suggestion (to which he does not commit himself) that
reason alone (that is, unensouled reason or the Form of reason) may be
prior to soul.</p>

The notion of god as a
craftsman in particular has connections to the <em>Timaeus</em>, but
the idea of god&rsquo;s reason as governing and as a cause of order in
the world recurs throughout the late dialogues: see for instance
<em>Tim.</em> 30A, 37D, 53A&ndash;B, 69B&ndash;C; <em>Phil.</em> 28D&ndash;E, 30C;
<em>Stsmn</em><em>.</em> 272E&ndash;273D.</p>

For discussion of these
and other issues, see Mayhew (2010). He himself thinks that some
important questions are simply left unsettled by the <em>Laws</em>,
perhaps because Plato himself does not yet know the answers and thinks
that it might undermine the virtue of the citizens if they were exposed
to abstruse theological disputes, and that Plato is leaving these
questions to his successors to investigate.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-62">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-62">62.</a>
There is a vast
literature on the relation between the <em>Laws</em>&rsquo; and the
<em>Timaeus</em>&rsquo; cosmology in particular. See, to start, Mohr
(1985, chs. 2, 7, 8, 9), Robinson (1995, pp. xviii&ndash;xix, xxiv&ndash;xxxii,
59&ndash;110, 145&ndash;57), and Vlastos (1994, vol. 2, chs. 15, 16). Important
questions include whether god is the source of <em>all</em> motions or
simply of order, and how to explain disorder and evil.</p>

See Irwin (1995, pp.

(1999, 2002).</p>

Note that in the

<div id="note-68">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-68">68.</a>
This latter problem only
becomes more difficult when we recall Plato&rsquo;s emphasis on the
motivational efficacy of pleasure in the <em>Laws</em> and his claim
that the <em>eudaim&ocirc;n</em> life is identical to the life of
greatest pleasure (<em>Laws</em> 662C&ndash;E), because then we will have to
show how the life in which I aim at the well-being of the whole is also
the most pleasant for me.</p>

 increased interest in the psychology of the <em>Timaeus</em> and, in
 particular, a debate over the status of the parts of the soul in
 the <em>Timaeus</em> and over whether desires and emotions in
 the <em>Timaeus</em> and other late dialogues have linguistic
 content: Bobonich (2002), (2010), Lorenz (2006) and (2012), Kamtekar

 A group of
four&mdash;<em>Parmenides</em>, <em>Phaedrus</em>, <em>Republic</em>, and
<em>Theaetetus</em>&mdash;are stylistically similar to each other and are
closer to the late group of six than they are to the remaining
dialogues. Most scholars taking other considerations into account go
further than this with regards to dating. Even Kahn (1996, pp. 47&ndash;8)
finds it reasonable to date the <em>Phaedrus</em> and the
<em>Theaetetus</em> in that order between the <em>Republic</em> and the
late group of six. The following scholars (in addition to Kahn) accept
that the <em>Phaedrus</em> and the <em>Theaetetus</em> occur in that
order between the <em>Republic</em> and the late group of six: Guthrie
(1987, vol. 4, pp. 50&ndash;1), Kraut in Kraut (1992, pp. 46 n. 57, 47 n.
61), Ross (1953, p. 10) and Vlastos (1991, pp. 46&ndash;7). Brandwood (1976,
p. xvii) and Ledger (1989, pp. 224&ndash;5) accept this order, except for
placing the <em>Theaetetus</em> just before the <em>Phaedrus</em>. For
further discussion of the <em>Phaedrus</em>&rsquo; date, see de Vries
(1969, pp. 7&ndash;11), Nussbaum (1986, pp. 465 n. 7, 470&ndash;1 n. 5), and Rowe
(1986b, pp. 13&ndash;4). I would like to thank Corinne Gartner for her help

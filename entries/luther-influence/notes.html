<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Luther&rsquo;s Influence on Philosophy</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a> Just to give one telling example:
Max Weber&rsquo;s central text <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit
of Capitalism</em> (1905), which perhaps did more than any other to
encourage an awareness of the intellectual and cultural significance
of Protestantism, famously gives Calvin the key role rather than
Luther: see, for example, Weber 1992: 56: &ldquo;Now Calvinism was the
faith over which the great political struggles of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries were fought in the most highly developed
countries, the Netherlands, England, and France&rdquo;. Philosophical
thinkers who come under Calvin&rsquo;s influence more specifically
would include Thomas Reid (1710&ndash;1796) and Jonathan Edwards
(1703&ndash;1758), as well as contemporary so-called &ldquo;Reformed
epistemology&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a> See, for example, Beck 1969: 101:</p>

<blockquote><p> Since neither a science of nature not a science of man
was called for [by Luther], and philosophical instruments were not
developed to adjust the deep tension between the secular and sacred
powers, Luther&rsquo;s immediate effect on the content of
philosophizing was negligible. Philosophy grows from a conflict of
values and a conflict of opinions only when these conflicts are
examined in the light of reason. When they are not, there is no
dialectic; there is heresy-hunting but no philosophy. For the latter,
Germany had to turn to others, and it turned first to Luther&rsquo;s
lieutenant [Melanchthon].</p></blockquote>

</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a> I will not here consider what might
be called Luther&rsquo;s &ldquo;negative&rdquo; influence: namely, his
influence on those thinkers who saw him as simply an object of
critique, where such thinkers are naturally enough primarily to be
found in the Catholic tradition: see for example Maritain 1925
[1928].</p>
</div>


<div id="note-4">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a> See Hobbes 1688:</p>

<blockquote><p> The persecuted faith recovered strength with the
proclamations of Luther<br/>who, speaking with a great voice, reached
the people,<br/>And cut the net of the Pope in more than a hundred
places; nets that<br/>had been woven, but badly woven, by the famous
Schools (1688 [2008: 573]) </p>

<p>
Luther&hellip;did<br/>not want Faith to be a slave&hellip;<br/>So, as
it rose, the new doctrine of the Saxon Luther shook off the spiritual
yoke of the Pope. (1688 [2008: 577])</p></blockquote>

<p>
In an anonymous 1722 paraphrase, which departs from the text of 1688,
these lines are made even more dramatic: </p>

<blockquote><p>
But Luther once from German coasts will come,<br/>To blast the
honours, and the pomp of Rome;<br/>He&rsquo;ll fetch their pious
frauds to public show,<br/>And with his Saxon thunder strike them low;
(Hobbes 1722: 130&ndash;31)</p>

<p>
When Luther first, in Saxon realms, arose,<br/>To rouse the faith, in
many parts, he rends,<br/>Their frauds exposes, and the faith
defends;<br/>Explodes their old prevaricating rules,<br/>Taught by the
Fathers and upheld by Schools; (1722: 181)</p>

<p>
So when the morning of the Gospel shone,<br/>And mists of Roman
ignorance were flown,<br/>Luther (great man) the Papal fetters
broke,<br/>And rescued Lands threw off the heavy
yoke. (1722:184)</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a> For a full discussion of this
debate, which sets it in historical context, see Jackson 2007.
Selections from works on both sides can be found in Hobbes and
Bramhall 1999.</p>
</div>


<div id="note-6">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a> Hobbes 1656, &sect;12 [1841: 115]:</p>

<blockquote><p> That which men make amongst themselves here by pacts
and covenants, and call by the name of justice, are accordingly
whereunto men are counted and termed rightly just and unjust, is not
that by which God Almighty&rsquo;s actions are to be measured or
called just, no more than his counsels are to be measured by human
wisdom.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a> See WA 18:711/LW 33:179, where
Luther speaks of &ldquo;the omnipotent mover&rdquo; [<em>omipotens
actor</em>].</p>
</div>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a> See <em>Heidelberg Disputation</em>
WA I:354/LW 31:40: &ldquo;Free will, after sin, exists in name only,
and as long as it does what it is able to do, it commits a mortal
sin&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a> In a letter to Duke Johann
Friedrich in 1679, Leibniz identifies this as the second part of a
theological project with three parts, the first of which is to
demonstrate the existence of God, and the third is to establish the
divine ordination of the church:</p>

<blockquote><p> The <em>second</em> part was to be about the Christian
religion, or revealed theology, where I sought to demonstrate the
possibility of our mysteries and to meet all the objections of those
who claim to show the absurdity and the contradictions in the Trinity,
the Incarnation, the Eucharist, and the resurrection of the
body&hellip; We must reply to objections in order to satisfy ourselves
entirely, since a single impossibility proved of our mysteries would
destroy the whole structure. (Leibniz 1976: 260)</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a> The doctrine of transubstantiation
claims that there is a change of substance from bread and wine to the
body and blood of Christ while the accidents of bread and wine remain;
the doctrine of real presence makes no such claim about a change of
substance and merely holds that the body and blood of Christ is
substantially present when the Eucharist is celebrated.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a> For a recent attempt to argue for
the significance of Leibniz to Lutheran theology, see Hinlicky
2009.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a> Pietism had also had an influence
on Thomasius, and would have an impact on some of those who came after
Kant, such as Hamann, Jacobi and Novalis, as well as Kierkegaard. For
further discussion see Barnett 2011.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a> For more on the role of Pietism in
Kant&rsquo;s upbringing and education, see Kuehn 2001: 34&ndash;41 and
65&ndash;85. Kuehn&rsquo;s view is that</p>

<blockquote><p> it is unlikely that Pietism had any fundamental and
lasting influence on Kant&rsquo;s philosophy. It is even doubtful that
the Pietism of his parents left any significant traces on Kant&rsquo;s
intellectual outlook, even if Kant&rsquo;s earliest biographers
suggest that it did. (2001: 39)</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>  Hegel 1821 [1991: 22]</p>

<blockquote><p> It is a great obstinacy, the kind of obstinacy which
does honour to human beings, that they are unwilling to acknowledge in
their attitudes [<em>Gesinnung</em>] anything which has not been
justified by thought&mdash;and this obstinacy is the characteristic
property of the modern age, as well as being the distinctive principle
of Protestantism. What Luther inaugurated as faith in feeling and in
the testimony of the spirit is the same thing that the spirit, at a
more mature stage of its development, endeavours to grasp in
the <em>concept</em> so as to free itself in the present and find
itself therein.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a> See Hegel 2011: 503:</p>

<blockquote><p> This principle of spiritual freedom was preserved in
the inwardness of the German spirit. All the other peoples ventured
forth to the East Indies, to India, and to America, to achieve worldly
sovereignty, as for example, did Spain. Whereas in Germany there
emerged a simple monk who was conscious that the <em>this</em> is to
be found in the deepest recesses of the heart, in the absolute
ideality of inwardness&hellip;.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a> See Assel 2014: 553: </p>

<blockquote><p> [Hegel] could not have known essential documents from
Luther&rsquo;s early theology of the cross (Romans
commentary, <em>Operationes in Psalmos</em>,
&ldquo;Anti-Latomas&rdquo;), but his early writings and
his <em>Ph&auml;nomenologie des Geistes</em> present dialectical
models (e.g. the reconciliation through Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion and
the ontology of the person crucified) which objectively, and properly,
claim to be a legacy of Luther&rsquo;s theology.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a> See <em>Heidelberg Disputation</em>, theses 19 and 20:</p>

<blockquote><p> The man who looks upon the invisible things of God as
they are perceived in created things does not deserve to be called a
theologian. But the man who perceives the visible rearward parts of
God [<em>visibilia et posteriora Dei</em>] as seen in suffering and
the cross does, however, deserve to be a theologian. (WA 1:354/LW
31:40, translation modified in line with McGrath 1985:
148)</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a> See Hampson 2017: 5:</p>

<blockquote><p> Conceiving of the person relationally, Luther knows
himself as the other reflects him back to himself, that
&ldquo;other&rdquo; being in his case God. Hegel will come out of this
tradition.</p></blockquote>

<p>
See also Hampson 2017: 7:</p>

<blockquote><p> In the Preface to his <em>Phenomenology</em>, Hegel
conceives of the self as in itself a relation, formed in a social
context, rather than persons being possessed of a substantial,
ontological nature. His metaphor of the master and the slave posits
that it is through the &ldquo;other&rdquo; (whether the individual or
the social context) that self-identity is achieved.</p></blockquote>

<p>
As Susanne Herrmann-Sinai has mentioned to me, Hegel&rsquo;s language
of &ldquo;master&rdquo; or &ldquo;lord&rdquo; [<em>Herr</em>] and
&ldquo;slave&rdquo; or &ldquo;servant&rdquo; [<em>Knecht</em>] used in
that dialectic in the <em>Phenomenology</em> is also to be found in
Luther&rsquo;s own famously dialectical claim in the <em>Freedom of
the Christian</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p> A Christian is a perfectly free lord [<em>ein freier
Herr</em>] of all, subject to none. A Christian is a perfectly dutiful
servant [<em>ein deinstbarer Knecht</em>] of all, subject to all. (WA
7:21 (German), 7:49 (Latin)/LW 31:344)</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a> Houlgate makes this general claim
about Hegel in Houlgate 2006: 60&ndash;66. He makes the connection to
Luther in 2015: 26.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a> See Hegel 1798&ndash;99 [1971:
244]:</p>

<blockquote><p> To complete subjection under the law of an alien Lord,
Jesus opposed not a particular subjection under a law of one&rsquo;s
own, the self-coercion of Kantian virtue, but virtues without lordship
and without submission, i.e. virtues as modifications of
love.</p></blockquote>
</div>


<div id="note-22">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a> To mention some that have been
relevant to considerations of Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy of religion and
his philosophy more generally: the Lutheran claim that
&ldquo;<em>finitum capax infinitii</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;the finite
bears the infinite&rdquo;); Luther&rsquo;s translation of Philippians
2:7 as relating to Hegel&rsquo;s conception of
&ldquo;self-emptying&rdquo; (<em>Ent&auml;u&szlig;erung</em>); that
the priesthood of all believers implies &ldquo;God existing as
community&rdquo;; the relation between the theology of the cross and
the death of God, and its relation to Hegel&rsquo;s portrait of the
&ldquo;unhappy consciousness&rdquo;. For some further discussion of
theological themes in Hegel, and how some relate to Luther, see
Asendorf 1982, Jaeschke 1986 [1992], Maurer 1996, Merklinger 1993,
O&rsquo;Regan 1994, and Thaidigsmann 1983.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a> See also Novalis 1799 [1996: 66]:</p>

<blockquote><p> Luther generally treated Christianity in an arbitrary
manner, misunderstood its spirit, and introduced another law and
another religion, namely the universal authority of the Bible. In this
manner another alien, earthly science&mdash;philology&mdash;interfered
with religious concerns, and its corrosive influence has been
unmistakable ever since. From the dark feeling of his error, a large
part of the Protestants elevated Luther to the rank of an evangelist
and canonized his translation./This decision was fatal for the
religious sense, since nothing destroys its sensibility as much as the
dead letter.</p></blockquote>

suffer for the doctrine, to do good and suffer for it, and that
suffering in this world is inseparable from being a Christian in this
world.</p></blockquote>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a> See Kierkegaard 1992: 416:
&ldquo;In our time, a person would be regarded as a lunatic if he
entered a monastery, were one established&rdquo;. But also:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There is no doubt that our age and Protestantism especially may need
the monastery again or that it should exist. &ldquo;The
monastery&rdquo; is an essential dialectical element in Christianity;
therefore we need to have it out there like a buoy at sea in order to
see where we are, even though I myself would not enter
it. (Kierkegaard KJP: 3, frag. 2750 [p. 211, 1847])</p></blockquote>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a> Kierkegaard KJP: 3, frag. 2503

<blockquote><p> I also wonder if Luther ever dreamed when he got
married that this would eventually go so far that a pastor would
almost think that if he only married he then would have done all that
God required of him.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-33">33.</a> Kierkegaard KJP: 1, frag. 7 (p. 5, 1850):</p>

<blockquote><p> [T]he concept of the absurd is precisely to grasp the
fact that it cannot and must not be grasped. This is a negatively
determined concept but is just as dialectical as any positive
one. The <em>absurd</em>, the <em>paradox</em>, is composed in such a
way that reason has no power at all to dissolve it in nonsense and
prove that it is nonsense; no, it is a symbol, a riddle, a compounded
riddle about which reason must say: I cannot solve it, it cannot be
understood, but it does not thereby follow that it is nonsense.
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Kierkegaard explicitly refers to Leibniz on this point at KJP: 3, 3073
(p. 399&ndash;400), from his notes on the <em>Theodicy</em> which he
recorded in 1842&ndash;43. For further discussion of the relation
between Kierkegaard and Leibniz, see L&oslash;kke and Waaler 2009.</p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-34">34.</a> For discussion of
Nietzsche&rsquo;s Lutheran (and Pietist) upbringing, see Pernet 1995
and Fraser 2002: 31&ndash;44. Richard Hollingdale has claimed that six
key ideas later to be found in <em>Thus Spake Zarathustra</em> can be
traced back to this upbringing: <em>amor fati</em>, eternal
recurrence, will to power, live dangerously, great noontide, and
superman (Hollingdale 1961: 27&ndash;9). For some criticism of
Hollingdale&rsquo;s claims, see Fraser 2002: 40&ndash;1.</p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-35">35.</a> Nietzsche, <em>Beyond Good and
Evil</em> (1886: &sect;164 [1966: 91]:</p>

<blockquote><p> Jesus said to his Jews: &ldquo;The law was for
servants&mdash;love God as I love him, as his son! What are morals to
us sons of God!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-36">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-36">36.</a> There is also some reflection on
Luther in the work of Antonio Gramsci (1891&ndash;1937), though this
is largely from the perspective of the historical impact of the
Reformation more generally. For some further discussion, see Adamson
2013.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-37">

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-37">37.</a> Theodor Adorno (1903&ndash;1969)
also accuses Luther of being the &ldquo;inventor of inwardness&rdquo;
(1951 [2005: 135]), an invention which was ultimately to lead to</p>

<blockquote><p> a mock image of an inner realm in which the silent
majority tries to get compensation for what it misses out for in
society</p></blockquote>

<p>
so that </p>

<blockquote><p> [a]ll this tends to make interiority increasingly
shadowlike and insubstantial. (1970 [1984: 169])</p></blockquote>

<p>
In the same passage, Adorno also calls Kierkegaard &ldquo;the founder
of inwardness&rdquo; (1970 [1984: 170]), which was a central theme of
his early work <em>Kierkegaard: Construction of the Aesthetic</em>
(1933 [1989]). This implies that Adorno saw Kierkegaard as standing in
this Lutheran tradition.</p>

to bring about a paradigm shift in Western history to
modernity.</p></blockquote>

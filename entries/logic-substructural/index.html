<h1>Substructural Logics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Jul 4, 2000; substantive revision Wed Feb 21, 2018</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

<em>Substructural logics</em> are non-classical logics <em>weaker</em>
than classical logic, notable for the absence of <em>structural
rules</em> present in classical logic. These logics are motivated by
considerations from philosophy (relevant logics), linguistics (the
Lambek calculus) and computing (linear logic). In addition, techniques
from substructural logics are useful in the study of traditional
logics such as classical and intuitionistic logic. This article
provides a brief overview of the field of substructural logic. For a
more detailed introduction, complete with theorems, proofs and
examples, the reader can consult the books and articles in the
Bibliography.</p>

<h2><a name="1">1. Residuation</a></h2>

<p>

Logic is about <em>logical consequence</em>. As a result, the
<em>conditional</em> is a central notion in logic because of its
intimate connection with logical consequence. This connection is
neatly expressed in the <em>residuation condition</em> (also known
as the <em>deduction theorem</em>):</p>

\[
p, q \vdash r \text{ if and only if } p \vdash q \rightarrow r
\]

<p>

It says that \(r\) follows from \(p\) together with
\(q\) just when \(q \rightarrow r\) follows
from \(p\) alone. The validity of the transition from \(q\)
to \(r\) (given \(p)\) is recorded by the conditional
\(q \rightarrow r\). </p>

<p>

This connection between the conditional and consequence is called
<em>residuation</em> by analogy with the case in mathematics. Consider
the connection between addition and substraction. \(a + b = c\) if and
only if \(a = c - b\). The resulting \(a\) (which is \(c - b)\) is the
<em>residual</em>, what is left of \(c\) when \(b\) is taken
away. Another name for this connection is the <em>deduction
theorem</em>.</p>

<p>

However, there the connection between consequence and the
conditional contains one extra factor. Not only is there the turnstile,
for logical consequence, and the conditional, encoding consequence
inside the language of propositions, there is also the <em>comma</em>,
indicating the <em>combination</em> of premises. We have read
&ldquo;\(p, q \vdash r\)&rdquo; as &ldquo;\(r\) follows from \(p\)
<em>together with</em> \(q\)&rdquo;. To combine premises is to
have a way to take them <em>together</em>. But how can we take them
together? It turns out that there are different ways to do so, and so,
different substructural logics. The behaviour of premise combination
varies as the behaviour of the conditional varies. In this introduction
we will consider some examples of this.</p>

<h3>1.1 Weakening</h3>

<p>

It is one thing for \(p\) to be true. It is another for the
conditional \(q \rightarrow p\) to be true. Yet, if
&lsquo;\(\rightarrow\)&rsquo; is a material conditional, \(q
\rightarrow p\) follows from \(p\). For many different reasons, we may
wish to understand how a conditional might work in
the <em>absence</em> of this inference. This is tied to the behaviour
of premise combination, as can be shown by this demonstration. </p>


\[
\cfrac{p \vdash p} 
{ \cfrac{p, q \vdash p}
  {p \vdash q \rightarrow p}
}
\]

<p>

From the axiomatic \(p \vdash p\) (anything follows from
<em>itself</em>) we deduce that \(p\) follows from \(p\) together with
\(q\), and then by residuation, \(p \vdash q \rightarrow p\). If we
wish to reject the inference from \(p\) to \(q \rightarrow p\), then
we either reject residuation, or reject the identity axiom at the
start of the proof, or we reject the first step of the proof. It is
illuminating to consider what is involved in this last option. Here,
we are to deny that \(p\) follows from \(p, q\). In general, we are to
reject the inference rule that has this form: </p>

\[
\frac{X \vdash A}
 {X, Y \vdash A}
\]

<p>

This is called the rule of <em>weakening</em>. The rule steps from a
stronger statement, that \(A\) follows from \(X\) to a
possibly weaker one, that \(A\) follows from \(X\) together
with \(Y\). </p>

<p>

People have offered different reasons for rejecting the rule of
weakening, depending on the interpretation of consequence and premise
combination. One of the early motivating examples comes from a concern
for relevance. If the logic is <em>relevant</em> (if to say that
\(p\) entails \(q\) is true is to say, at least, that
\(q\) truly <em>depends</em> on \(p)\) then the comma need
not not satisfy weakening. We may indeed have \(A\) following
from \(X\), without \(A\) following from
\(X,Y\), for it need not be the case that \(A\)
depends on \(X\) and \(Y\) together.</p>

<p>

In relevant logics the rule of weakening fails on the <em>other</em>
side too, in that we wish <em>this</em> argument to be invalid too:</p>

\[
\cfrac{q \vdash q}
 { \cfrac{p, q \vdash q}
   {p \vdash q \rightarrow q}
 }
\]

<p>

Again, \(q\) may follow from \(q\), but this does not mean
that it follows from \(p\) <em>together with</em> \(q\),
provided that &ldquo;together with&rdquo; is meant in an appropriately
strong sense. So, in relevant logics, the inference from an arbitrary
premise to a logical truth such as \(q \rightarrow q\) may
well fail. </p>

<h3>1.2 Commutativity</h3>

<p>

If the mode of premise combination is commutative (if anything which
follows from \(X, Y\) also follows from \(Y,
X)\) then we can reason as follows, using just the identity
axiom and residuation: </p>

\[
\cfrac{p \rightarrow q \vdash p \rightarrow q}
 { \cfrac{p \rightarrow q, p \vdash q}
   { \cfrac{p, p \rightarrow q \vdash q}
     {p \vdash(p \rightarrow q) \rightarrow q}
   }
 }
\]

<p>

In the absence of commutativity of premise combination, this proof is
not available. This is another simple example of the connection between
the behaviour of premise combination and that of deductions involving
the conditional. </p>

<p>

There are many kinds of conditional for which this inference fails.
If &ldquo;\(\rightarrow\)&rdquo; has <em>modal</em> force (if it
expresses a kind of entailment, in which \(p \rightarrow q\) is true
when in every related circumstance in which \(p\) holds, \(q\) does
too), and if &ldquo;\(\vdash\)&rdquo; expresses local consequence
\((p\vdash q\) if and only if any model, at any circumstance at which
\(p\) holds, so does \(q)\) it fails. It may be true that Greg is a
logician \((p)\) and it is true that Greg&rsquo;s being a logician
entails Greg&rsquo;s being a philosopher \((p \rightarrow q\) &ndash;
in related circunstances in which Greg is a logician, he is a
philosopher) but this does not <em>entail</em> that Greg is a
philosopher. (There are many circumstances in which the entailment
\((p \rightarrow q)\) is true but \(q\) is not.) So we a circumstance
in which \(p\) is true but \((p \rightarrow q) \rightarrow q\) is
not. The argument is invalid.</p>

<p>

This counterexample can also be understood in terms of behaviour of
premise combination. Here when we say \(X,A \vdash B\) is true, we are
not just saying that \(B\) holds in any circumstance in which \(X\)
and \(A\) both hold.  If we are after a
genuine <em>entailment</em> <em>A \(\rightarrow\) B</em>, then we want
\(B\) to be true in any (related) circumstance in which \(A\) is
true. So, \(X,A \vdash B\) says that in <em>any</em> possibility in
which \(A\) is true, so is \(B\). These possibilities might not
satisfy all of \(X\). (In classical theories of entailment, the
possibilities are those in which all that is taken
as <em>necessary</em> in \(X\) are true.)</p>

<p>

If premise combination is not commutative, then residuation can go in
<em>two</em> ways. In addition to the residuation condition giving the
behaviour of \(\rightarrow\), we may wish to define a new arrow
\(\leftarrow\) as follows:</p>

\[
p, q \vdash r \text{ if and only if } q \vdash r \leftarrow p
\]

<p>

For the left-to-right arrow we have <em>modus ponens</em> in this
direction: </p>

\[
p \rightarrow q, p \vdash q
\]

<p>

For the right-to-left arrow, <em>modus ponens</em> is provable with the
premises in the opposite order: </p>

\[
p, q \leftarrow p \vdash q
\]

<p>

This is a characteristic of substructural logics. When we pay attention
to what happens when we don&rsquo;t have the full complement of structural
rules, then new possibilities open up. We uncover <em>two</em>
conditionals underneath what was previously one (in intuitionistic or
classical logic). </p>

<p>

In the next section we will see
 <a href="#ord">another example</a>
motivating non-commutative premise combination and these two different
conditionals.</p>

<h3>1.3 Associativity</h3>

<p>

Here is another way that structural rules influence proof. The
associativity of premise combination provides the following proof: </p>

\[ 
\cfrac{r \rightarrow p, r \vdash p \ \ \ p \rightarrow q, p \vdash q}
 { \cfrac{p \rightarrow q, (r \rightarrow p, r) \vdash q}
   { \cfrac{(p \rightarrow q, r \rightarrow p), r \vdash q}
     { \cfrac{ p \rightarrow q, r \rightarrow p \vdash r \rightarrow q }
       {p \rightarrow q \vdash(r \rightarrow p) \rightarrow(r \rightarrow q)}
     }
   }
 }
\]

<p>

This proof uses the <em>cut</em> rule at the topmost step. The idea is
that inferences can be combined. If \(X \vdash A\) and \(Y(A) \vdash
B\) (where \(Y(A)\) is a structure of premises possibly including
\(A\) one or more times) then \(Y(X) \vdash B\) too (where \(Y(X)\) is
that structure of premises with those instances of \(A\) replaced by
\(X)\). In this proof, we replace the \(p\) in \(p \rightarrow q, p
\vdash q\) by \(r \rightarrow p, r\) on the basis of the validity of
\(r \rightarrow p, r \vdash p\). </p>

<h3>1.4 Contraction</h3>

<p>

A final important example is the rule of <em>contraction</em> which
dictates how premises may be reused. Contraction is crucial in the
inference of \(p \rightarrow q\) from \(p \rightarrow 
(p \rightarrow q)\) </p>

\[
  \cfrac{
   \matrix{ 
     \cfrac{p \rightarrow(p \rightarrow q) \vdash p \rightarrow(p \rightarrow q)}
          {p \rightarrow(p \rightarrow q), p \vdash p \rightarrow q}
     &amp;
     \cfrac{p \rightarrow q \vdash p \rightarrow q}
          {p \rightarrow q, p \vdash q}
     }
   }
   { \cfrac{(p \rightarrow(p \rightarrow q), p), p \vdash q}
       { \cfrac{p \rightarrow(p \rightarrow q), p \vdash q}
          {p \rightarrow(p \rightarrow q) \vdash p \rightarrow q}
       }
   }
\]

<p>

These different examples give you a taste of what can be done by
structural rules. Not only do structural rules influence the
conditional, but they also have their effects on other connectives,
such as conjunction and disjunction (as we shall see below) and
negation (Dunn 1993; Restall 2000). </p>

<h3>1.5 Structure on the right of the turnstile</h3>

<p>

Since the introduction of Gentzen&rsquo;s sequent calculus (Gentzen
1935), we have known that the difference between <em>classical</em>
logic and <em>intuitionistic</em> logic can also be understood as a
difference of structural rules. Instead of considering sequents of the
form \(X \vdash A\), in
which we have a collection of antecedents and a single consequent, for
classical logic it is fruitful to consider sequents of the form </p>

\[
X \vdash Y
\]

<p>

where both \(X\) and \(Y\) are collections of statements. The
intended interpretation is that from <em>all</em> of the \(X\) it
follows that <em>some</em> of the \(Y\). In other words, we cannot
have all of the \(X\) and none of the \(Y\) obtaining. </p>

<p>

Allowing sequents with multiple consequents and translating the
rules into this expanded context, we are able to derive classical
tautologies. For example, the derivation</p>

\[
\cfrac{p \vdash p}
{ \cfrac{p \vdash q, p}
  {\vdash p \rightarrow q, p}
}
\]

<p>

shows that either \(p \rightarrow q\) or \(p\) must hold.
This is classically valid (if \(p\) fails, \(p\) is
<em>false</em>, and conditionals with false antecedents are true), but
invalid in intuitionistic logic. The difference between classical and
intuitionistic logic, then, can be understood formally as a difference
between the kinds of structural rules permitted, and the kinds of
structures appropriate to use in the analysis of logical consequence. </p>

<h2><a name="2">2. Logics in the Family</a></h2>

<p>

There are many different formal systems in the family of substructural
logics. These logics can be motivated in different ways. </p>

<h3>2.1 Relevant Logics</h3>

<p>

Many people have wanted to give an account of logical validity which
pays some attention to conditions of <em>relevance</em>. If \(X,A
\vdash B\) holds, then \(X\) must somehow be <em>relevant</em> to
\(A\).  Premise combination is restricted in the following way. We may
have \(X \vdash A\) without also having \(X,Y \vdash A\) . The new
material \(Y\) might not be relevant to the deduction. In the 1950s,
Moh (1950), Church (1951) and Ackermann (1956) all gave accounts of
what a &lsquo;relevant&rsquo; logic could be. The ideas have been
developed by a stream of workers centred around Anderson and Belnap,
their students Dunn and Meyer, and many others.  The canonical
references for the area are Anderson, Belnap and Dunn&rsquo;s
two-volume <em>Entailment</em> (1975 and 1992). Other introductions
can be found in Read&rsquo;s <em>Relevant Logic</em>, Dunn and
Restall&rsquo;s <em>Relevance Logic</em> (2002), and
Mares&rsquo; <em>Relevant Logic</em>: <em>a philosophical
interpretation</em> (2004). </p>

<h3>2.2 Resource Consciousness</h3>

<p>

This is not the only way to restrict premise combination. Girard (1987)
introduced <em>linear logic</em> as a model for processes and resource
use. The idea in this account of deduction is that resources must be
used (so premise combination satisfies the relevance criterion) and
they do not extend <em>indefinitely</em>. Premises cannot be
\(re\)-used. So, I might have \(X,X \vdash A\), which says that I can use \(X\) twice
to get \(A\). I might not have \(X \vdash A\), which says that I can use \(X\) once
alone to get \(A\). A helpful introduction to linear logic is
given in Troelstra&rsquo;s <em>Lectures on Linear Logic</em> (1992).
There are other formal logics in which the <em>contraction rule</em>
(from \(X,X \vdash A\) to
\(X \vdash A)\) is absent.
Most famous among these are &#321;ukasiewicz&rsquo;s many-valued
logics. There has been a sustained interest in logics without this rule
because of Curry&rsquo;s paradox (Curry 1977, Geach 1995; see also
Restall 1994 in Other Internet Resources). </p>

<h3><a name="ord">3. Order</a></h3>

<p>

Independently of either of these traditions, Joachim Lambek considered
mathematical models of language and syntax (Lambek 1958, 1961). The
idea here is that premise combination corresponds to composition of
strings or other linguistic units. Here \(X,X\) differs
in content from \(X\), but in addition, \(X,Y\)
differs from <em>Y,X</em>. Not only does the <em>number</em> of
premises used count but so does their <em>order</em>. Good
introductions to the Lambek calculus (also called <em>categorial
grammar</em>) can be found in books by Moortgat (1988) and Morrill
(1994).</p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Proof Systems</a></h2>

<p>

We have already seen a fragment of one way to present substructural
logics, in terms of proofs. We have used the residuation condition,
which can be understood as including two rules for the conditional, one
to <em>introduce</em> a conditional </p>

\[
\cfrac{X, A \vdash B}
 {X \vdash A \rightarrow B}
\]

<p>

and another to <em>eliminate</em> it. </p>

\[
\cfrac{X \vdash A \rightarrow B \ \ \ Y \vdash A}
      {X, Y \vdash B}
\]

<p>

Rules like these form the cornerstone of a natural deduction system,
and these systems are available for the wide sweep of substructural
logics. But proof theory can be done in other ways. <em>Gentzen</em>
systems operate not by introducing and eliminating connectives, but by
introducing them both on the left and the right of the turnstile of
logical consequence. We keep the introduction rule above, and replace
the elimination rule by one introducing the conditional on the left: </p>

\[
\cfrac{X \vdash A \ \ \ Y(B) \vdash C}
  {Y(A \rightarrow B, X) \vdash C}
\]

<p>

This rule is more complex, but it has the same effect as the arrow
elimination rule: It says that if \(X\) suffices for \(A\), and if you
use \(B\) (in some context \(Y)\) to prove \(C\) then you could just
as well have used \(A \rightarrow B\) together with \(X\) (in that
same context \(Y)\) to prove \(C\), since \(A \rightarrow B\) together
with \(X\) gives you \(B\). </p>

<p>

Gentzen systems, with their introduction rules on the left and the
right, have very special properties which are useful in studying
logics. Since connectives are always <em>introduced</em> in a proof
(read from top to bottom) proofs never <em>lose</em> structure. If a
connective does not appear in the conclusion of a proof, it will not
appear in the proof at all, since connectives cannot be eliminated.</p>

<p>

In certain substructural logics, such as linear logic and the Lambek
calculus, and in the fragment of the relevant logic \(\mathbf{R}\)
without disjunction, a Gentzen system can be used to show that the
logic is <em>decidable</em>, in that an algorithm can be found to
determine whether or not an argument \(X \vdash A\) is valid. This is
done by searching for proofs of \(X \vdash A\) in a Gentzen
system. Since premises of this conclusion must feature no language not
in this conclusion, and they have no greater complexity (in these
systems), there are only a finite number of possible premises. An
algorithm can check if these satisfy the rules of the system, and
proceed to look for premises for these, or to quit if we hit an
axiom. In this way, decidability of some substructural logics is
assured.</p>

<p>

However, not all substructural logics are decidable in this sense.
Most famously, the relevant logic \(\mathbf{R}\) is not decidable.
This is partly because its proof theory is more complex than that of
other substructural logics. \(\mathbf{R}\) differs from linear
logic and the Lambek calculus in having a straightforward treatment of
conjunction and disjunction. In particular, conjunction and disjunction
satisfy the rule of <em>distribution</em>:</p>

\[
p \amp(q \vee r) \vdash (p \amp q) \vee (p \amp r)
\]

<p>

The natural proof of distribution in any proof system uses both
weakening and contraction, so it is not available in the relevant logic
\(\mathbf{R}\), which does not contain weakening. As a result,
proof theories for \(\mathbf{R}\) either contain distribution as a
primitive rule, or contain a second form of premise combination (so
called <em>extensional</em> combination, as opposed to the
<em>intensional</em> premise combination we have seen) which satisfies
weakening and contraction. </p>

<p>

In recent years, a great deal of work has been done on the proof
theory of <em>classical logic</em>, inspired and informed by research
into substructural logics. Classical logic has the full complement of
structural rules, and is historically prior to more recent systems of
substructural logics. However, when it comes to attempting to
understand the deep structure of <em>classical</em> proof systems (and
in particular, when two derivations that differ in some superficial
syntactic way are <em>really</em> different ways to represent the one
underlying &lsquo;proof&rsquo;) it is enlightening to think of
classical logic as formed by a basic substructural logic, in which
extra structural rules are imposed as additions. In particular, it has
become clear that what distinguishes classical proof from its siblings
is the presence of the structural rules of contraction and weakening in
their complete generality (see, for example, Bellin <em>et al.</em>
2006 and the literature cited therein).</p>

<h2><a name="4">4. Model Theory</a></h2>

<p>

While the relevant logic \(\mathbf{R}\) has a proof system more
complex than the substructural logics such as linear logic, which lack
distribution of (extensional) conjunction over disjunction, its
<em>model theory</em> is altogether more simple. A Routley-Meyer
<em>model</em> for the relevant logic \(\mathbf{R}\) is comprised
of a set of <em>points</em> \(P\) with a three-place relation
\(R\) on \(P\). A conditional \(A \rightarrow B\) is
evaluated at a world as follows: </p>

<p class="indent">
\(A \rightarrow B\) is true at \(x\) if and only if for each \(y\) and
\(z\) where \(Rxyz\), if \(A\) is true at \(y, B\) is true at \(z\).
</p>

<p>

An argument is <em>valid</em> in a model just when in any point at
which the premises are true, so is the conclusion. The argument \(A
\vdash B \rightarrow B\) is invalid because we may have a point \(x\)
at which \(A\) is true, but at which \(B \rightarrow B\) is not.  We
can have \(B \rightarrow B\) fail to be true at \(x\) simply by having
\(Rxyz\) where \(B\) is true at \(y\) but not at \(z\). </p>

<p>

The three place relation \(R\) follows closely the behaviour of the
mode of premise combination in the proof theory for a substructural
logic. For different logics, different conditions can be placed on
\(R\). For example, if premise combination is commutative, we place
a <em>symmetry</em> condition on \(R\) like this: \(Rxyz\) if and only
if \(Ryxz\). Ternary relational semantics gives us great facility
to <em>model</em> the behaviour of substructural logics. (The extent
of the correspondence between the proof theory and algebra of
substructural logics and the semantics is charted in Dunn&rsquo;s work
on <em>Gaggle Theory</em> (1991) and is summarised in
Restall&rsquo;s <em>Introduction to Substructural Logics</em>
(2000).)</p>

<p>

Furthermore, if conjunction and disjunction satisfy the distribution
axiom mentioned in the previous section, they can be modelled
straightforwardly too: a conjunction is true at a point just when both
conjuncts are true at that point, and a disjunction is true at a point
just when at least one disjunct is true there. For logics, such as
linear logic, <em>without</em> the distribution axiom, the semantics
must be more complex, with a different clause for disjunction required
to invalidate the inference of distribution.</p>

<p>

It is one thing to use a semantics as a formal device to model a
logic. It is another to use a semantics as an <em>interpretive</em>
device to <em>apply</em> a logic. The literature on substructural
logics provides us with a number of different ways that the ternary
relational semantics can be applied to describe the logical structure
of some phenomena in which the traditional structural rules do not
apply.</p>

<p>

For logics like the Lambek calculus, the interpretation of the
semantics is straightforward. We can take the points to be linguistic
items, and the ternary relation to be the relation of concatenation
(\(Rxyz\) if and only if \(x\) concatenated with \(y\)
results in \(z)\). In these models, the structural rules of
contraction, weakening and permutation all fail, but premise
combination is associative.</p>

<p>

The contemporary literature on linguistic classification extends the
basic Lambek Calculus with richer forms of combination, in which more
syntactic features can be modelled (see Moortgat 1995).</p>

<p>

Another application of these models is in the treatment of the
semantics of <em>function application</em>. We can think of the points
in a model structure as both <em>functions</em> and <em>data</em>, and
hold that \(Rxyz\) if and only if \(x\) (considered as a
function) applied to \(y\) (considered as data) is \(z\).
Traditional accounts of functions do not encourage this dual use, since
functions are taken to be of a &lsquo;higher&rsquo; than their inputs
or outputs (on the traditional set-theoretic model of functions, a
function \(is\) the set of its <em>input-output</em> pairs, and
so, it can never take <em>itself</em> as an input, since sets cannot
contain themselves as members). However, systems of functions modelled
by the untyped \(\lambda\)-calculus, for example, allow for
self-application. Given this reading of points in a model, a point is
of type \(A \rightarrow B\) just if whenever it takes inputs
of type \(A\), it takes outputs of type \(B\). The inference
rules of this system are then principles governing types of functions:
the sequent</p>

\[
(A \rightarrow B) \amp(A \rightarrow C) \vdash A \rightarrow (B \amp C)
\]

<p>

tells us that whenever a function takes \(A\)s to \(B\)s and
\(A\)s to \(C\)s, then it takes \(A\)s to things that
are both \(B\) and \(C\). </p>

<p>

This example gives us a model in which the appropriate substructural
logic is extremely weak. <em>None</em> of the usual structural rules
(not even associativity) are satisfied in this model. This example of a
ternary relational model is discussed in (Restall 2000, Chapter
11).</p>

<p>

For the relevant logic \(\mathbf{R}\) and its interpretation of
natural language conditionals, more work must be done in identifying
what features of reality the formal semantics models. This has been a
matter of some controversy, since not only is the ternary relation
unfamiliar to those whose exposure is primarily to modal logics with a
simpler <em>binary</em> accessibility relation between possible worlds,
but also because of the novelty of the treatment of <em>negation</em>
in models for relevant logics. It is not our place to discuss this
debate in much detail here, Some of this work is reported in the
article on
 <a href="../logic-relevance/index.html">relevant logic</a>
 in this
Encyclopedia, and a book-length treatment of relevant logic in this
light is Mares&rsquo; <em>Relevant Logic</em>: <em>a philosophical
interpretation</em> (2004).</p>

<h2><a name="5">5. Quantifiers</a></h2>

<p>
The treatment of quantifiers in models for substructural logics has
proved to be quite difficult, but advances have been made in the early
2000s. The difficulty came in what seemed to be a mismatch between the
proof theory and model theory for quantifiers. Appropriate axioms or
rules for the quantifiers are relatively straightforward. The
universal quantifier elimination axiom \[ \forall xA \rightarrow
A[t/x] \] states that an instance follows (in the relevant sense) from
its universal generalisation. The introduction rule \[ \cfrac{\vdash
A\rightarrow B} {\vdash A\rightarrow \forall xB} \] (where the proviso
that \(x\) is not free in \(A\) holds) tells us that if we can prove
an instance of the generalisation \(\forall xB\), as a matter of
logic, from some assumption which makes no particular claim about that
instance, we can also prove the generalisation from that
assumption. This axiom and rule seems to fit nicely with any
interpretation of the first-order quantifiers in a range of
substructural logics, from the weakest systems, to strong systems like
\(\mathbf{R}\).
</p>

<p>
While the proof theory for quantifiers seems well behaved, the
generalisation to model theory for substructural logics has proved
difficult. Richard Routley (1980) showed that  adding the rules for
the quantifiers to a very weak system of substructural logic
\(\mathbf{B}\) fits appropriately with the ternary relational
semantics, where quantifiers are interpreted as ranging over a domain
of objects, constant across all of the points in the model. This fact
does <em>not</em> apply for stronger logics, in particular, the
relevant logic \(\mathbf{R}\).  Kit Fine (1989) showed that there
exists a complex formula which holds in all constant domain frame
models for \(\mathbf{R}\) but which is not derivable from the axioms.
The details of Fine&rsquo;s argument are not important for our purposes, but
the underlying cause for the mismatch is relatively straightforward to
explain. In the constant domain semantics, the universal
generalisation \(\forall x Fx\) has exactly the same truth
conditions&mdash;at every point in the model&mdash;as the family of
instances \(Fx_1\), \(Fx_2\), \(Fx_3,\ldots\), \(Fx_\lambda,\ldots\),
where the objects of the domains are enumerated by the values of the
terms \(x_i\).  So, the quantified expression \(\forall x Fx\) is
semantically indistinguishable from the (possibly infinite)
conjunction \(Fx_1\land Fx_2\land Fx_3\land\cdots \). However, no
conjunction of instances (even an infinite one) could
be <em>relevantly</em> equivalent to the universally quantified claim
\(\forall x Fx\), because the instances could be true in a
circumstance (or could be made true by a circumstance) without also
making true the generalisation&mdash;if there had been more
things than those. So, constant domain models seem ill-suited to the
project of a relevant theory of quantification.
</p>

<p>
Recent work by Goldblatt and Mares (2006) has shown that there is an
alternative, and it turns out to be elegant and relatively
straightforward. The crucial idea is to modify the ternary relational
semantics just a little, so that not every set of points need count as
a &lsquo;proposition&rsquo;. That is, not every set of points is the
possible semantic value for a sentence. So, while there is a set of
worlds determined by the infinite conjunction of instances of
\(\forall xFx\): \(Fx_1\land Fx_2\land Fx_3\land\cdots \), that
precise set of worlds may not count as a proposition. (Perhaps there
is no way to single out those particular objects in such a way as to
draw them together in the one judgement.) What we <em>can</em> say is
the generalisation \(\forall xFx\) and that is a proposition that
entails each of the instances (that is the universal quantifier
elimination axiom), and if a proposition entails each instance, it
entails the generalisation (that is the introduction rule), so the
proposition expressed by \(\forall xFx\) is the <em>semantically
weakest</em> proposition that entails each instance <em>Fa</em>. This
is precisely the modelling condition for the universal quantifier in
Goldblatt &amp; Mares&rsquo; models, and it matches the axioms exactly.

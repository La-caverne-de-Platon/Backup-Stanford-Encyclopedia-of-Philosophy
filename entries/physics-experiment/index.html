<h1>Experiment in Physics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Oct 5, 1998; substantive revision Wed Oct 16, 2019</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Physics, and natural science in general, is a reasonable enterprise
based on valid experimental evidence, criticism, and rational
discussion. It provides us with knowledge of the physical world, and it
is experiment that provides the evidence that grounds this knowledge.
Experiment plays many roles in science. One of its important roles is
to test theories and to provide the basis for scientific
 knowledge.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 It can also call for a new theory, either by
showing that an accepted theory is incorrect, or by exhibiting a new
phenomenon that is in need of explanation. Experiment can provide hints
toward the structure or mathematical form of a theory and it can
provide evidence for the existence of the entities involved in our
theories. Finally, it may also have a life of its own, independent of
theory. Scientists may investigate a phenomenon just because it looks
interesting. Such experiments may provide evidence for a future theory
to explain. [Examples of these different roles will be presented
below.] As we shall see below, a single experiment may play several of
these roles at once.</p>

<p>

If experiment is to play these important roles in science then we
must have good reasons to believe experimental results, for science is
a fallible enterprise. Theoretical calculations, experimental results,
or the comparison between experiment and theory may all be wrong.
Science is more complex than &ldquo;The scientist proposes, Nature disposes.&rdquo;
It may not always be clear what the scientist is proposing. Theories
often need to be articulated and clarified. It also may not be clear
how Nature is disposing. Experiments may not always give clear-cut
results, and may even disagree for a time.</p>

<p>

In what follows, the reader will find an epistemology of experiment,
a set of strategies that provides reasonable belief in experimental
results. Scientific knowledge can then be reasonably based on these
experimental results.</p>

<h2 id="ExpeResu">1. Experimental Results</h2>

<h3 id="EpisExpe">1.1 Epistemology of Experiment</h3>


<p>

The 17th century witnessed the first philosophical reflections on the
nature of experimentation. This should not be surprising given that
experiment was emerging as a central scientific tool at the time. The
aim of these reflections was to uncover why nature reveals its hidden
aspects to us when we force experimental methods upon it.</p>

<p> Some natural philosophers believed that scientific knowledge was
little more than the proper application of observational and
experimental techniques on natural phenomena. Francis Bacon went so
far as to claim that it was possible to perform what he called a
crucial experiment (experimentum crucis), an ideal experiment of sorts
that can determine alone which of two rival hypotheses is correct. And
even some of the giants of modern science such as Newton subscribed to
the view that scientific theories are directly induced from
experimental results and observations without the help of untested
hypotheses. It is little wonder, then, that many natural philosophers
thought that experimental techniques and their proper application
should be a primary object of philosophical study of science.</p>

<p>

Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend vigorously criticized this view. They
argued that observations and experimental results are already part of
a theoretical framework and thus cannot confirm a theory
independently. Nor there is a theory-neutral language for capturing
observations. Even a simple reading of a mercury thermometer
inevitably depends on a theoretically-charged concept of
temperature. In short, the evidence is always theory-laden.</p>

<p>

Yet neither the proponents of logical positivism nor their critics
ever attempted to explain the nature of experimentation that produces
all-important observational statements. And the reason for this was
very simple: they didn&rsquo;t think that there was anything interesting to
explain. Their views on the relationship between theory and evidence
were diametrically opposed, but they all found only the final product
of experimentation, namely observational statements, philosophically
interesting. As a result, the experimental process itself was set
aside in their philosophical study of science. This has gradually
changed only with the advent of New Experimentalism, with Ian
Hacking&rsquo;s work at its forefront.</p>

<p>
Yet not everybody agreed.  Hobbes, for instance pointed out that human
reason preceded experimental techniques and their application. He
thought that human reasoning reveals to us the natural law, and
criticized Boyle&rsquo;s optimism regarding experimental method&rsquo;s ability to
reveal it (Shapin and Schaffer 1984). Doesn&rsquo;t human reason guide
experimenter&rsquo;s actions, in the way it leads us to choose data and
samples, and the way it allows us to interpret them, after all? If so,
we should focus on the philosophical study of reason and theoretical
scientific reasoning rather than on the study of experimental
techniques and their applications.</p>

<p>
  
This vigorous early debate in many ways anticipated the main points of
disagreement in debates to come. Yet the philosophical interest in
experimentation almost completely lost its steam at the end of the
19th century and did not recover until fairly late in the 20th
century.</p>

<p>

During that period philosophers turned much of their attention to the
study of the logical structure of scientific theories and its
connection to evidence. The tenets of logical positivism influenced
this area of investigation &mdash; as well as philosophy more
generally &mdash; at the time. One of these tenets stated that
observational and theoretical propositions in science are
separable. My readings of the gradation on the scale of a mercury
thermometer can be separated from rather complicated theoretical
statements concerning heat transfer and the theoretical concept of
temperature.</p>

<p>

In fact, not only can one separate theory and observation, but the
former is considered justified only in light of its correspondence
with the latter. The theory of heat transfer is confirmed by
propositions originating in the kind of readings I perform on my
mercury thermometer. Thus, observational propositions are simply a
result of an experiment or a set of observations a scientist performs
in order to confirm or refute a theory.</p>

<h3 id="CaseForLearExpe">1.2 The Case For Learning From Experiment</h3>


<h4 id="IanHackCase">1.2.1 Ian Hacking's Case</h4>

<p>

It has been almost four decades since Ian Hacking asked, &ldquo;Do we see
through a microscope?&rdquo; (Hacking 1981). Hacking&rsquo;s question really
asked how do we come to believe in an experimental result obtained
with a complex experimental apparatus? How do we distinguish between a
valid
 result<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 and an artifact created by that apparatus?
If experiment is to play all of the important roles in science
mentioned above and to provide the evidential basis for scientific
knowledge, then we must have good reasons to believe in those results.
Hacking provided an extended answer in the second half of
<em>Representing and Intervening</em> (1983). He pointed out that even
though an experimental apparatus is laden with, at the very least, the
theory of the apparatus, observations remain robust despite changes in
the theory of the apparatus or in the theory of the phenomenon. His
illustration was the sustained belief in microscope images despite the
major change in the theory of the microscope when Abbe pointed out the
importance of diffraction in its operation. One reason Hacking gave for
this is that in making such observations the experimenters
intervened&mdash;they manipulated the object under observation. Thus, in
looking at a cell through a microscope, one might inject fluid into the
cell or stain the specimen. One expects the cell to change shape or
color when this is done. Observing the predicted effect strengthens our
belief in both the proper operation of the microscope and in the
observation. This is true in general. Observing the predicted effect of
an intervention strengthens our belief in both the proper operation of
the experimental apparatus and in the observations made with it. </p>

<p>

Hacking also discussed the strengthening of one&rsquo;s belief in an
observation by independent confirmation. The fact that the same
pattern of dots&mdash;dense bodies in cells&mdash;is seen with
&ldquo;different&rdquo; microscopes, (e.g. ordinary, polarizing,
phase-contrast, fluorescence, interference, electron, acoustic etc.)
argues for the validity of the observation.  One might question
whether &ldquo;different&rdquo; is a theory-laden term. After all, it
is our theory of light and of the microscope that allows us to
consider these microscopes as different from each other. Nevertheless,
the argument holds. Hacking correctly argues that it would be a
preposterous coincidence if the same pattern of dots were produced in
two totally different kinds of physical systems. Different apparatuses
have different backgrounds and systematic errors, making the
coincidence, if it is an artifact, most unlikely. If it is a correct
result, and the instruments are working properly, the coincidence of
results is understandable.</p>

<h4 id="ExpeStra">1.2.2 Experimental Strategies</h4>

<p>

Hacking&rsquo;s answer is correct as far as it goes. It is, however,
incomplete. What happens when one can perform the experiment with only
one type of apparatus, such as an electron microscope or a radio
telescope, or when intervention is either impossible or extremely
difficult? Other strategies are needed to validate the
 observation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 These may include:</p>

<ol>

<li>Experimental checks and calibration, in which the
experimental apparatus reproduces known phenomena. For example, if we
wish to argue that the spectrum of a substance obtained with a new type
of spectrometer is correct, we might check that this new spectrometer
could reproduce the known Balmer series in hydrogen. If we correctly
observe the Balmer Series then we strengthen our belief that the
spectrometer is working properly. This also strengthens our belief in
the results obtained with that spectrometer. If the check fails then we
have good reason to question the results obtained with that apparatus.</li>

<li>Reproducing artifacts that are known in advance to be present. An
example of this comes from experiments to measure the infrared spectra
of organic molecules (Randall et al. 1949). It was not always possible
to prepare a pure sample of such material. Sometimes the experimenters
had to place the substance in an oil paste or in solution. In such
cases, one expects to observe the spectrum of the oil or the solvent,
superimposed on that of the substance. One can then compare the
composite spectrum with the known spectrum of the oil or the solvent.
Observation then of this artifact gives confidence in other
measurements made with the spectrometer.</li>

<li>Elimination of plausible sources of error and alternative
explanations of the result (the Sherlock Holmes
 strategy).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 Thus, when
scientists claimed to have observed electric discharges in the rings of
Saturn, they argued for their result by showing that it could not have
been caused by defects in the telemetry, interaction with the
environment of Saturn, lightning, or dust. The only remaining
explanation of their result was that it was due to electric discharges
in the rings&mdash;there was no other plausible explanation of the
observation. (In addition, the same result was observed by both Voyager
1 and Voyager 2. This provided independent confirmation. Often, several
epistemological strategies are used in the same experiment.)</li>

<li>Using the results themselves to argue for their validity.
Consider the problem of Galileo&rsquo;s telescopic observations of the moons
of Jupiter. Although one might very well believe that his primitive,
early telescope might have produced spurious spots of light, it is
extremely implausible that the telescope would create images that they
would appear to be a eclipses and other phenomena consistent with the
motions of a small planetary system. It would have been even more
implausible to believe that the created spots would satisfy Kepler&rsquo;s
Third Law (\(\bfrac{R^3}{T^2} = \) constant). A similar argument
was used by Robert Millikan to support his observation of the
quantization of electric charge and his measurement of the charge of
the electron. Millikan remarked, &ldquo;The total number of changes
which we have observed would be between one and two thousand,
and <em>in not one single instance has there been any change which did
not represent the advent upon the drop of one definite invariable
quantity of electricity or a very small multiple of that
quantity</em>&rdquo; (Millikan 1911, p. 360).  In both of these cases
one is arguing that there was no plausible malfunction of the
apparatus, or background, that would explain the observations.</li>

<li>Using an independently well-corroborated theory of the phenomena
to explain the results. This was illustrated in the discovery of the
\(\ce{W^{\pm}}\), the charged intermediate vector boson required by
the Weinberg-Salam unified theory of electroweak interactions. Although
these experiments used very complex apparatuses and used other
epistemological strategies (for details see (Franklin 1986, pp.
170&ndash;72)). I believe that the agreement of the observations with the
theoretical predictions of the particle properties helped to validate
the experimental results. In this case the particle candidates were
observed in events that contained an electron with high transverse
momentum and in which there were no particle jets, just as predicted by
the theory. In addition, the measured particle mass of \(81\pm 5\)
GeV/c<sup>2</sup> and \(80^{+10}_{-6}\) GeV/c<sup>2</sup>, 
found in the two experiments (note the
independent confirmation also), was in good agreement with the
theoretical prediction of \(82\pm 2.4\) GeV/c<sup>2</sup>. It was
very improbable that any background effect, which might mimic the
presence of the particle, would be in agreement with theory.</li>

<li>Using an apparatus based on a well-corroborated theory. In this
case the support for the theory inspires confidence in the apparatus
based on that theory. This is the case with the electron microscope and
the radio telescope, whose operations are based on a well-supported
theories, although other strategies are also used to validate the
observations made with these instruments.</li>

<li>Using statistical arguments. An interesting example of this arose
in the 1960s when the search for new particles and resonances occupied
a substantial fraction of the time and effort of those physicists
working in experimental high-energy physics. The usual technique was to
plot the number of events observed as a function of the invariant mass
of the final-state particles and to look for bumps above a smooth
background. The usual informal criterion for the presence of a new
particle was that it resulted in a three standard-deviation effect
above the background, a result that had a probability of 0.27% of
occurring in a single bin. This criterion was later changed to four
standard deviations, which had a probability of 0.0064% when it was
pointed out that the number of graphs plotted each year by high-energy
physicists made it rather probable, on statistical grounds, that a
three standard-deviation effect would be observed.</li>

</ol>

<p>

These strategies along with Hacking&rsquo;s intervention and independent
confirmation constitute an epistemology of experiment. They provide us
with good reasons for belief in experimental results, They do not,
however, guarantee that the results are correct. There are many
experiments in which these strategies are applied, but whose results
are later shown to be incorrect (examples will be presented below).
Experiment is fallible. Neither are these strategies exclusive or
exhaustive. No single one of them, or fixed combination of them,
guarantees the validity of an experimental result. Physicists use as
many of the strategies as they can conveniently apply in any given
experiment. </p>

<h4 id="GaliElab">1.2.3 Galison&rsquo;s Elaboration</h4>

<p>

In <em>How Experiments End</em> (1987), Peter Galison extended the
discussion of experiment to more complex situations. In his histories
of the measurements of the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron, the
discovery of the muon, and the discovery of weak neutral currents, he
considered a series of experiments measuring a single quantity, a set
of different experiments culminating in a discovery, and two high-
energy physics experiments performed by large groups with complex
experimental apparatus. </p>

<p>

Galison&rsquo;s view is that experiments end when the experimenters
believe that they have a result that will stand up in court&mdash;a result
that I believe includes the use of the epistemological strategies
discussed earlier. Thus, David Cline, one of the weak neutral-current
experimenters remarked, &ldquo;At present I don&rsquo;t see how to make these
effects [the weak neutral current event candidates] go away&rdquo; (Galison,
1987, p. 235).</p>

<p>

Galison emphasizes that, within a large experimental group, different
members of the group may find different pieces of evidence most
convincing. Thus, in the Gargamelle weak neutral current experiment,
several group members found the single photograph of a
neutrino-electron scattering event particularly important, whereas for
others the difference in spatial distribution between the observed
neutral current candidates and the neutron background was decisive.
Galison attributes this, in large part, to differences in experimental
traditions, in which scientists develop skill in using certain types
of instruments or apparatus. In particle physics, for example, there
is the tradition of visual detectors, such as the cloud chamber or the
bubble chamber, in contrast to the electronic tradition of Geiger and
scintillation counters and spark chambers. Scientists within the
visual tradition tend to prefer &ldquo;golden events&rdquo; that
clearly demonstrate the phenomenon in question, whereas those in the
electronic tradition tend to find statistical arguments more
persuasive and important than individual events. (For further
discussion of this issue see Galison (1997)).</p>

<p>

Galison points out that major changes in theory and in experimental
practice and instruments do not necessarily occur at the same time.
This persistence of experimental results provides continuity across
these conceptual changes. Thus, the experiments on the gyromagnetic
ratio spanned classical electromagnetism, Bohr&rsquo;s old quantum theory,
and the new quantum mechanics of Heisenberg and Schrodinger. Robert
Ackermann has offered a similar view in his discussion of scientific
instruments.</p>

<blockquote>The advantages of a scientific instrument are that it
cannot change theories. Instruments embody theories, to be sure, or we
wouldn&rsquo;t have any grasp of the significance of their
operation&hellip;.Instruments create an invariant relationship between
their operations and the world, at least when we abstract from the
expertise involved in their correct use. When our theories change, we
may conceive of the significance of the instrument and the world with
which it is interacting differently, and the datum of an instrument may
change in significance, but the datum can nonetheless stay the same,
and will typically be expected to do so. An instrument reads 2 when
exposed to some phenomenon. After a change in
 theory,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 it will
continue to show the same reading, even though we may take the reading
to be no longer important, or to tell us something other than what we
thought originally (Ackermann 1985, p. 33).</blockquote>

<p>

Galison also discusses other aspects of the interaction between
experiment and theory. Theory may influence what is considered to be a
real effect, demanding explanation, and what is considered background.
In his discussion of the discovery of the muon, he argues that the
calculation of Oppenheimer and Carlson, which showed that showers were
to be expected in the passage of electrons through matter, left the
penetrating particles, later shown to be muons, as the unexplained
phenomenon. Prior to their work, physicists thought the showering
particles were the problem, whereas the penetrating particles seemed to
be understood.</p>

<p>

The role of theory as an &ldquo;enabling theory,&rdquo; (i.e., one that allows
calculation or estimation of the size of the expected effect and also
the size of expected backgrounds) is also discussed by Galison. (See
also (Franklin 1995) and the discussion of the Stern-Gerlach
experiment below). Such a theory can help to determine whether an
experiment is feasible. Galison also emphasizes that elimination of
background that might simulate or mask an effect is central to the
experimental enterprise, and not a peripheral activity. In the case of
the weak neutral current experiments, the existence of the currents
depended crucially on showing that the event candidates could not all
be due to neutron
 background.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

There is also a danger that the design of an experiment may preclude
observation of a phenomenon. Galison points out that the original
design of one of the neutral current experiments, which included a muon
trigger, would not have allowed the observation of neutral currents. In
its original form the experiment was designed to observe charged
currents, which produce a high energy muon. Neutral currents do not.
Therefore, having a muon trigger precluded their observation. Only
after the theoretical importance of the search for neutral currents was
emphasized to the experimenters was the trigger changed. Changing the
design did not, of course, guarantee that neutral currents would be
observed.</p>

<p>

Galison also shows that the theoretical presuppositions of the
experimenters may enter into the decision to end an experiment and
report the result. Einstein and de Haas ended their search for
systematic errors when their value for the gyromagnetic ratio of the
electron, \(g = 1\), agreed with their theoretical model of
orbiting electrons. This effect of presuppositions might cause one to
be skeptical of both experimental results and their role in theory
evaluation. Galison&rsquo;s history shows, however, that, in this case, the
importance of the measurement led to many repetitions of the
measurement. This resulted in an agreed-upon result that disagreed with
theoretical expectations.</p>

<p>

Recently, Galison has modified his views. In <em>Image and Logic</em>,
an extended study of instrumentation in 20th-century high-energy
physics, Galison (1997) has extended his argument that there are two
distinct experimental traditions within that field&mdash;the visual (or
image) tradition and the electronic (or logic) tradition.  The image
tradition uses detectors such as cloud chambers or bubble chambers,
which provide detailed and extensive information about each individual
event. The electronic detectors used by the logic tradition, such as
geiger counters, scintillation counters, and spark chambers, provide
less detailed information about individual events, but detect more
events. Galison&rsquo;s view is that experimenters working in these two
traditions form distinct epistemic and linguistic groups that rely on
different forms of argument. The visual tradition emphasizes the
single &ldquo;golden&rdquo; event. &ldquo;On the image side resides a
deep-seated commitment to the &lsquo;golden event&rsquo;: the single
picture of such clarity and distinctness that it commands
acceptance.&rdquo; (Galison, 1997, p. 22) &ldquo;The golden event was
the exemplar of the image tradition: an individual instance so
complete and well defined, so &lsquo;manifestly&rsquo; free of
distortion and background that no further data had to be
involved&rdquo; (p. 23). Because the individual events provided in the
logic detectors contained less detailed information than the pictures
of the visual tradition, statistical arguments based on large numbers
of events were required.</p>

<p>

Kent Staley (1999) disagrees. He argues that the two traditions are
not as distinct as Galison believes:</p>

<blockquote>I show that discoveries in both traditions have employed
the same statistical [I would add &ldquo;and/or probabilistic&rdquo;]
form of argument, even when basing discovery claims on single, golden
events.  Where Galison sees an epistemic divide between two
communities that can only be bridged by creole- or pidgin-like
&lsquo;interlanguage,&rsquo; there is in fact a shared commitment to a
statistical form of experimental argument. (p. 96).</blockquote>

<p>

Staley believes that although there is certainly epistemic
continuity within a given tradition, there is also a continuity between
the traditions. This does not, I believe, mean that the shared
commitment comprises all of the arguments offered in any particular
instance, but rather that the same methods are often used by both
communities. Galison does not deny that statistical methods are used in
the image tradition, but he thinks that they are relatively
unimportant. &ldquo;While statistics could certainly be used within the image
tradition, it was by no means necessary for most applications&rdquo;
(Galison, 1997, p. 451). In contrast, Galison believes that arguments
in the logic tradition &ldquo;were inherently and inalienably statistical.
Estimation of probable errors and the statistical excess over
background is not a side issue in these detectors&mdash;it is central to the
possibility of any demonstration at all&rdquo; (p. 451).</p>

<p>

Although a detailed discussion of the disagreement between Staley
and Galison would take us too far from the subject of this essay, they
both agree that arguments are offered for the correctness of
experimental results. Their disagreement concerns the nature of those
arguments. (For further discussion see Franklin, (2002), pp. 9&ndash;17).</p>

<h3 id="CaseAgaiLearExpe">1.3 The Case Against Learning From Experiment</h3>

<h4 id="CollExpeRegr">1.3.1 Collins and the Experimenters&rsquo; Regress</h4>

<p>

Collins, Pickering, and others, have raised objections to the view that
experimental results are accepted on the basis of epistemological
arguments. They point out that &ldquo;a sufficiently determined critic can
always find a reason to dispute any alleged &lsquo;result&rsquo;&rdquo;
(MacKenzie 1989, p. 412). Harry Collins, for example, is well known for
his skepticism concerning both experimental results and evidence. He
develops an argument that he calls the &ldquo;experimenters&rsquo; regress&rdquo;
(Collins 1985, chapter 4, pp. 79&ndash;111): What scientists take to be a
correct result is one obtained with a good, that is, properly
functioning, experimental apparatus. But a good experimental apparatus
is simply one that gives correct results. Collins claims that there are
no formal criteria that one can apply to decide whether or not an
experimental apparatus is working properly. In particular, he argues
that calibrating an experimental apparatus by using a surrogate signal
cannot provide an independent reason for considering the apparatus to
be reliable. </p>

<p>

In Collins&rsquo; view the regress is eventually broken by negotiation
within the appropriate scientific community, a process driven by
factors such as the career, social, and cognitive interests of the
scientists, and the perceived utility for future work, but one that is
not decided by what we might call epistemological criteria, or reasoned
judgment. Thus, Collins concludes that his regress raises serious
questions concerning both experimental evidence and its use in the
evaluation of scientific hypotheses and theories. Indeed, if no way out
of the regress can be found, then he has a point.</p>

<p>

Collins strongest candidate for an example of the experimenters&rsquo;
regress is presented in his history of the early attempts to detect
gravitational radiation, or gravity waves. (For more detailed
discussion of this episode see (Collins 1985; 1994; Franklin 1994;
1997a) In this case, the physics community was forced to compare
Weber&rsquo;s claims that he had observed gravity waves with the reports from
six other experiments that failed to detect them. On the one hand,
Collins argues that the decision between these conflicting experimental
results could not be made on epistemological or methodological
grounds&mdash;he claims that the six negative experiments could not
legitimately be regarded as
 replications<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 and hence become less
impressive. On the other hand, Weber&rsquo;s apparatus, precisely because the
experiments used a new type of apparatus to try to detect a hitherto
unobserved
 phenomenon,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 could not be subjected to standard
calibration techniques.</p>

<p>

The results presented by Weber&rsquo;s critics were not only more
numerous, but they had also been carefully cross-checked. The groups
had exchanged both data and analysis programs and confirmed their
results. The critics had also investigated whether or not their
analysis procedure, the use of a linear algorithm, could account for
their failure to observe Weber&rsquo;s reported results. They had used
Weber&rsquo;s preferred procedure, a nonlinear algorithm, to analyze their
own data, and still found no sign of an effect. They had also
calibrated their experimental apparatuses by inserting acoustic pulses
of known energy and finding that they could detect a signal. Weber, on
the other hand, as well as his critics using his analysis procedure,
could not detect such calibration pulses.</p>

<p>

There were, in addition, several other serious questions raised
about Weber&rsquo;s analysis procedures. These included an admitted
programming error that generated spurious coincidences between Weber&rsquo;s
two detectors, possible selection bias by Weber, Weber&rsquo;s report of
coincidences between two detectors when the data had been taken four
hours apart, and whether or not Weber&rsquo;s experimental apparatus could
produce the narrow coincidences claimed.</p>

<p>

It seems clear that the critics&rsquo; results were far more credible than
Weber&rsquo;s. They had checked their results by independent confirmation,
which included the sharing of data and analysis programs. They had also
eliminated a plausible source of error, that of the pulses being longer
than expected, by analyzing their results using the nonlinear algorithm
and by explicitly searching for such long
 pulses.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 They had also calibrated
their apparatuses by injecting pulses of known energy and observing the
output.</p>

<p>

Contrary to Collins, I believe that the scientific community made a
reasoned judgment and rejected Weber&rsquo;s results and accepted those of
his critics. Although no formal rules were applied (e.g. if you make
four errors, rather than three, your results lack credibility; or if
there are five, but not six, conflicting results, your work is still
credible) the procedure was reasonable.</p>

<p>

Pickering has argued that the reasons for accepting results are the
future utility of such results for both theoretical and experimental
practice and the agreement of such results with the existing community
commitments. In discussing the discovery of weak neutral currents,
Pickering states,</p>

<blockquote>Quite simply, particle physicists accepted the existence of
the neutral current because they could see how to ply their trade more
profitably in a world in which the neutral current was real. (1984b, p.
87) 

<p>

Scientific communities tend to reject data that conflict with group
commitments and, obversely, to adjust their experimental techniques to
tune in on phenomena consistent with those commitments. (1981, p.
236)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

The emphasis on future utility and existing commitments is clear. These
two criteria do not necessarily agree. For example, there are episodes
in the history of science in which more opportunity for future work is
provided by the overthrow of existing theory. (See, for example, the
history of the overthrow of parity conservation and of CP symmetry
discussed below and in (Franklin 1986, Ch. 1, 3)). </p>

<h4 id="PickCommOppoPlasReso">1.3.2 Pickering on Communal Opportunism and Plastic Resources</h4>

<p>

Pickering has recently offered a different view of experimental
results. In his view the material procedure (including the experimental
apparatus itself along with setting it up, running it, and monitoring
its operation), the theoretical model of that apparatus, and the
theoretical model of the phenomena under investigation are all plastic
resources that the investigator brings into relations of mutual
support. (Pickering 1987; Pickering 1989). He says: </p>

<blockquote>Achieving such relations of mutual support is, I suggest,
the defining characteristic of the successful experiment. (1987, p.
199)</blockquote>

<p>

He uses Morpurgo&rsquo;s search for free quarks, or fractional charges of
\(\tfrac{1}{3} e\) or \(\tfrac{2}{3} e\), where \(e\) is the charge of the
electron. (See also (Gooding 1992)). Morpurgo used a modern
Millikan-type apparatus and initially found a continuous distribution
of charge values. Following some tinkering with the apparatus, Morpurgo
found that if he separated the capacitor plates he obtained only
integral values of charge. &ldquo;After some theoretical analysis, Morpurgo
concluded that he now had his apparatus working properly, and reported
his failure to find any evidence for fractional charges&rdquo; (Pickering
1987, p. 197). </p>

<p>

Pickering goes on to note that Morpurgo did not tinker with the two
competing theories of the phenomena then on offer, those of integral
and fractional charge:</p>

<blockquote>The initial source of doubt about the adequacy of the
early stages of the experiment was precisely the fact that their
findings&mdash;continuously distributed charges&mdash;were consonant
with neither of the phenomenal models which Morpurgo was prepared to
countenance.  And what motivated the search for a new instrumental
model was Morpurgo&rsquo;s eventual success in producing findings in
accordance with one of the phenomenal models he was willing to accept

<p>

The conclusion of Morpurgo&rsquo;s first series of experiments, then, and
the production of the observation report which they sustained, was
marked by bringing into relations of mutual support of the three
elements I have discussed: the material form of the apparatus and the
two conceptual models, one instrumental and the other phenomenal.
Achieving such relations of mutual support is, I suggest, the defining
characteristic of the successful experiment. (p. 199)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Pickering has made several important and valid points concerning
experiment. Most importantly, he has emphasized that an experimental
apparatus is initially rarely capable of producing a valid experimental
results and that some adjustment, or tinkering, is required before it
does. He has also recognized that both the theory of the apparatus and
the theory of the phenomena can enter into the production of a valid
experimental result. What one may question, however, is the emphasis
he places on these theoretical components. From Millikan onwards,
experiments had strongly supported the existence of a fundamental unit
of charge and charge quantization. The failure of Morpurgo&rsquo;s apparatus to
produce measurements of integral charge indicated that it was not
operating properly and that his theoretical understanding of it was
faulty. It was the failure to produce measurements in agreement with
what was already known (i.e., the failure of an important experimental
check) that caused doubts about Morpurgo&rsquo;s measurements. This was true
regardless of the theoretical models available, or those that Morpurgo
was willing to accept. It was only when Morpurgo&rsquo;s apparatus could
reproduce known measurements that it could be trusted and used to
search for fractional charge. To be sure, Pickering has allowed a role
for the natural world in the production of the experimental result, but
it does not seem to be decisive.</p>

<h4 id="CritRespPick">1.3.3 Critical Responses to Pickering</h4>

<p>

Ackermann has offered a modification of Pickering&rsquo;s view. He suggests
that the experimental apparatus itself is a less plastic resource then
either the theoretical model of the apparatus or that of the
phenomenon. </p>

<blockquote>To repeat, changes in \(A\) [the apparatus] can often be seen
(in real time, without waiting for accommodation by \(B\) [the theoretical
model of the apparatus]) as improvements, whereas
&lsquo;improvements&rsquo; in \(B\) don&rsquo;t begin to count unless \(A\) is
actually altered and realizes the improvements conjectured. It&rsquo;s
conceivable that this small asymmetry can account, ultimately, for
large scale directions of scientific progress and for the objectivity
and rationality of those directions. (Ackermann 1991, p. 456)</blockquote>

<p>

Hacking (1992) has also offered a more complex version of
Pickering&rsquo;s later view. He suggests that the results of mature
laboratory science achieve stability and are self-vindicating when the
elements of laboratory science are brought into mutual consistency and
support. These are (1) ideas: questions, background knowledge,
systematic theory, topical hypotheses, and modeling of the apparatus;
(2) things: target, source of modification, detectors, tools, and data
generators; and (3) marks and the manipulation of marks: data, data
assessment, data reduction, data analysis, and interpretation.</p>

<blockquote>Stable laboratory science arises when theories and
laboratory equipment evolve in such a way that they match each other
and are mutually self-vindicating. (1992, p. 56) 

<p>

We invent devices that produce data and isolate or create phenomena,
and a network of different levels of theory is true to these phenomena.
Conversely we may in the end count them only as phenomena only when the
data can be interpreted by theory. (pp. 57&ndash;8)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

One might ask whether such mutual adjustment between theory and
experimental results can always be achieved? What happens when an
experimental result is produced by an apparatus on which several of the
epistemological strategies, discussed earlier, have been successfully
applied, and the result is in disagreement with our theory of the
phenomenon? Accepted theories can be refuted. Several examples will be
presented below. </p>

<p>

Hacking himself worries about what happens when a laboratory science
that is true to the phenomena generated in the laboratory, thanks to
mutual adjustment and self-vindication, is successfully applied to the
world outside the laboratory. Does this argue for the truth of the
science. In Hacking&rsquo;s view it does not. If laboratory science does
produce happy effects in the &ldquo;untamed world,&hellip; it is not the
truth of anything that causes or explains the happy effects&rdquo; (1992, p.
60).</p>

<h4 id="PickDancAgen">1.3.4 Pickering and the Dance of Agency</h4>

<p>

Recently Pickering has offered a somewhat revised account of science.
&ldquo;My basic image of science is a performative one, in which the
performances the doings of human and material agency come to the fore.
Scientists are human agents in a field of material agency which they
struggle to capture in machines (Pickering, 1995, p. 21).&rdquo; He then
discusses the complex interaction between human and material agency,
which I interpret as the interaction between experimenters, their
apparatus, and the natural world. </p>

<blockquote>The dance of agency, seen asymmetrically from the human
end, thus takes the form of a <em>dialectic of resistance and
accommodations,</em> where resistance denotes the failure to achieve
an intended capture of agency in practice, and accommodation an active
human strategy of response to resistance, which can include revisions
to goals and intentions as well as to the material form of the machine
in question and to the human frame of gestures and social relations
that surround it (p. 22).&ldquo;</blockquote>

<p>

Pickering&rsquo;s idea of resistance is illustrated by Morpurgo&rsquo;s
observation of continuous, rather than integral or fractional,
electrical charge, which did not agree with his expectations.
Morpurgo&rsquo;s accommodation consisted of changing his experimental
apparatus by using a larger separation between his plates, and also by
modifying his theoretical account of the apparatus. That being done,
integral charges were observed and the result stabilized by the mutual
agreement of the apparatus, the theory of the apparatus, and the
theory of the phenomenon. Pickering notes that &rdquo;the outcomes
depend on how the world is (p. 182).&ldquo; &rdquo;In this way,
then, <em>how the material world is</em> leaks into and infects our
representations of it in a nontrivial and consequential fashion. My
analysis thus displays an intimate and responsive engagement between
scientific knowledge and the material world that is integral to
scientific practice (p. 183).&ldquo;</p>

<p>

Nevertheless there is something confusing about Pickering&rsquo;s invocation
of the natural world. Although Pickering acknowledges the importance
of the natural world, his use of the term &rdquo;infects&ldquo; seems
to indicate that he isn&rsquo;t entirely happy with this. Nor does the
natural world seem to have much efficacy. It never seems to be
decisive in any of Pickering&rsquo;s case studies. Recall that he argued
that physicists accepted the existence of weak neutral currents
because &rdquo;they could ply their trade more profitably in a world
in which the neutral current was real.&ldquo; In his account,
Morpurgo&rsquo;s observation of continuous charge is important only because
it disagrees with his theoretical models of the phenomenon. The fact
that it disagreed with numerous previous observations of integral
charge doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter. This is further illustrated by
Pickering&rsquo;s discussion of the conflict between Morpurgo and
Fairbank. As we have seen, Morpurgo reported that he did not observe
fractional electrical charges. On the other hand, in the late 1970s
and early 1980s, Fairbank and his collaborators published a series of
papers in which they claimed to have observed fractional charges (See,
for example, LaRue, Phillips et al. 1981 ). Faced with this discord
Pickering concludes,</p>

<blockquote>In Chapter 3, I traced out Morpurgo&rsquo;s route to his findings
in terms of the particular vectors of cultural extension that he
pursued, the particular resistances and accommodations thus
precipitated, and the particular interactive stabilizations he
achieved. The same could be done, I am sure, in respect of Fairbank.
And these tracings are all that needs to said about their divergence.
It just happened that the contingencies of resistance and accommodation
worked out differently in the two instances. Differences like these
are, I think, continually bubbling up in practice, without any special
causes behind them (pp. 211&ndash;212).</blockquote>

<p>

The natural world seems to have disappeared from Pickering&rsquo;s
account. There is a real question here as to whether or not fractional
charges exist in nature. The conclusions reached by Fairbank and by
Morpurgo about their existence cannot both be correct. It seems
insufficient to merely state, as Pickering does, that Fairbank and
Morpurgo achieved their individual stabilizations and to leave the
conflict unresolved. (Pickering does comment that one could follow the
subsequent history and see how the conflict was resolved, and he does
give some brief statements about it, but its resolution is not
important for him). At the very least one should consider the actions
of the scientific community. Scientific knowledge is not determined
individually, but communally. Pickering seems to acknowledge
this. &rdquo;One might, therefore, want to set up a metric and say
that items of scientific knowledge are more or less objective
depending on the extent to which they are threaded into the rest of
scientific culture, socially stabilized over time, and so on. I can
see nothing wrong with thinking this way&hellip;. (p. 196).&ldquo; The
fact that Fairbank believed in the existence of fractional electrical
charges, or that Weber strongly believed that he had observed gravity
waves, does not make them right. These are questions about the natural
world that can be resolved. Either fractional charges and gravity
waves exist or they don&rsquo;t, or to be more cautious we might say that we
have good reasons to support our claims about their existence, or we
do not.</p>

<p>

Another issue neglected by Pickering is the question of whether a
particular mutual adjustment of theory, of the apparatus or the
phenomenon, and the experimental apparatus and evidence is justified.
Pickering seems to believe that any such adjustment that provides
stabilization, either for an individual or for the community, is
acceptable. Others disagree. They note that experimenters sometimes
exclude data and engage in selective analysis procedures in producing
experimental results.  These practices are, at the very least,
questionable as is the use of the results produced by such practices
in science. There are, in fact, procedures in the normal practice of
science that provide safeguards against them. (For details see
Franklin, 2002, Section 1).</p>

<p>

The difference in attitudes toward the resolution of discord is one of
the important distinctions between Pickering&rsquo;s and Franklin&rsquo;s view of
science.  Franklin remarks that it is insufficient simply to say that
the resolution is socially stabilized. The important question is how
that resolution was achieved and what were the reasons offered for
that resolution. If we are faced with discordant experimental results
and both experimenters have offered reasonable arguments for their
correctness, then clearly more work is needed. It seems reasonable, in
such cases, for the physics community to search for an error in one,
or both, of the experiments.</p>

<p>

Pickering discusses yet another difference between his view and that
of Franklin. Pickering sees traditional philosophy of science as
regarding objectivity &rdquo;as stemming from a peculiar kind of
mental hygiene or policing of thought.  This police function relates
specifically to theory choice in science, which,&hellip; is usually
discussed in terms of the rational rules or methods responsible for
closure in theoretical debate (p. 197).&ldquo; He goes on to remark
that,</p>

<blockquote>The most action in recent methodological thought has
centered on attempts like Allan Franklin&rsquo;s to extend the methodological
approach to experiments by setting up a set of rules for their proper
performance. Franklin thus seeks to extend classical discussions of
objectivity to the empirical base of science (a topic hitherto
neglected in the philosophical tradition but one that, of course the
mangle [Pickering&rsquo;s view] also addresses). For an argument between
myself and Franklin on the same lines as that laid out below, see
(Franklin 1990, Chapter 8; Franklin 1991); and (Pickering 1991); and
for commentaries related to that debate, (Ackermann 1991) and (Lynch
1991) (p. 197).&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>

For further discussion see (Franklin 1993b)). Although Franklin&rsquo;s
epistemology of experiment is designed to offer good reasons for
belief in experimental results, they are not a set of rules. Franklin
regards them as a set of strategies, from which physicists choose, in
order to argue for the correctness of their results. As noted above,
the strategies offered are neither exclusive or exhaustive.</p>

<p>

There is another point of disagreement between Pickering and Franklin.
Pickering claims to be dealing with the practice of science, and yet he
excludes certain practices from his discussions. One scientific
practice is the application of the epistemological strategies 
outlined above to argue for the correctness of an experimental results.
In fact, one of the essential features of an experimental paper is the
presentation of such arguments. Writing such
papers, a performative act, is also a scientific practice and it would
seem reasonable to examine both the structure and content of those
papers.</p>

<h4 id="HackSociConsWhat">1.3.5 Hacking&rsquo;s The Social Construction of What?</h4>

<p>

Recently Ian Hacking (1999, chapter 3) has provided an incisive and
interesting discussion of the issues that divide the constructivists
(Collins, Pickering, etc.) from the rationalists (Stuewer, Franklin,
Buchwald, etc.). He sets out three sticking points between the two
views: 1) contingency, 2) nominalism, and 3) external explanations of
stability. </p>

<p>

Contingency is the idea that science is not predetermined, that it
could have developed in any one of several successful ways. This is the
view adopted by constructivists. Hacking illustrates this with
Pickering&rsquo;s account of high-energy physics during the 1970s during
which the quark model came to dominate. (See Pickering 1984a).</p>

<blockquote>The constructionist maintains a contingency thesis. In the
case of physics, (a) physics theoretical, experimental, material) could
have developed in, for example, a nonquarky way, and, by the detailed
standards that would have evolved with this alternative physics, could
have been as successful as recent physics has been by its detailed
standards. Moreover, (b) there is no sense in which this imagined
physics would be equivalent to present physics. The physicist denies
that. (Hacking 1999, pp. 78&ndash;79). 

<p>

To sum up Pickering&rsquo;s doctrine: there could have been a research
program as successful (&ldquo;progressive&rdquo;) as that of
high-energy physics in the 1970s, but with different theories,
phenomenology, schematic descriptions of apparatus, and apparatus, and
with a different, and progressive, series of robust fits between these
ingredients. Moreover and this is something badly in need of
clarification the &ldquo;different&rdquo; physics would not have been
equivalent to present physics. Not logically incompatible with, just
different.</p>

<p>

The constructionist about (the idea) of quarks thus claims that the
upshot of this process of accommodation and resistance is not fully
predetermined. Laboratory work requires that we get a robust fit
between apparatus, beliefs about the apparatus, interpretations and
analyses of data, and theories. <em>Before a robust fit has been
achieved, it is not determined what that fit will be. Not determined by
how the world is, not determined by technology now in existence, not
determined by the social practices of scientists, not determined by
interests or networks, not determined by genius, not determined by
anything</em> (pp. 72&ndash;73, emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Much depends here on what Hacking means by &ldquo;determined.&rdquo;
If he means entailed then one must agree with him. It is doubtful that
the world, or more properly, what we can learn about it, entails a
unique theory. If not, as seems more plausible, he means that the way
the world is places no restrictions on that successful science, then
the rationalists disagree strongly. They want to argue that the way the
world is restricts the kinds of theories that will fit the phenomena,
the kinds of apparatus we can build, and the results we can obtain
with such apparatuses. To think otherwise seems silly. Consider a
homey example.  It seems highly unlikely that someone can come up with
a successful theory in which objects whose density is greater than
that of air fall upwards. This is not a caricature of the view Hacking
describes. Describing Pickering&rsquo;s view, he states, &ldquo;Physics did
not need to take a route that involved Maxwell&rsquo;s Equations, the Second
Law of Thermodynamics, or the present values of the velocity of light
(p. 70).&rdquo; Although one may have some sympathy for this view as
regards Maxwell&rsquo;s Equations or the Second Law of Thermodynamics, one
may not agree about the value of the speed of light. That is
determined by the way the world is. Any successful theory of light
must give that value for its speed.</p>

<p>

At the other extreme are the &ldquo;inevitablists,&rdquo; among whom
Hacking classifies most scientists. He cites Sheldon Glashow, a Nobel
Prize winner, &ldquo;Any intelligent alien anywhere would have come
upon the same logical system as we have to explain the structure of
protons and the nature of supernovae (Glashow 1992, p. 28).&rdquo;</p>

<p>

Another difference between Pickering and Franklin on contingency
concerns the question of not whether an alternative is possible, but
rather whether there are reasons why that alternative should be
pursued. Pickering seems to identify <em>can</em> with
<em>ought</em>.</p>

<p>

In the late 1970s there was a disagreement between the results of
low-energy experiments on atomic parity violation (the violation of
left-right symmetry) performed at the University of Washington and at
Oxford University and the result of a high-energy experiment on the
scattering of polarized electrons from deuterium (the SLAC E122
experiment). The atomic-parity violation experiments failed to observe
the parity-violating effects predicted by the Weinberg- Salam (W-S)
unified theory of electroweak interactions, whereas the SLAC experiment
observed the predicted effect. These early atomic physics
results were quite uncertain in themselves and that uncertainty was
increased by positive results obtained in similar experiments at
Berkeley and Novosibirsk. At the time the theory had other evidential
support, but was not universally accepted. Pickering and Franklin are in
agreement that the W-S theory was accepted on the basis of the SLAC
E122 result. They differ dramatically in their discussions of the
experiments. Their difference on contingency concerns a particular
theoretical alternative that was proposed at the time to explain the
discrepancy between the experimental results.</p>

<p>

Pickering asked why a theorist might not have attempted to find a
variant of electroweak gauge theory that might have reconciled the
Washington-Oxford atomic parity results with the positive E122 result.
(What such a theorist was supposed to do with the supportive atomic
parity results later provided by experiments at Berkeley and at
Novosibirsk is never mentioned). &ldquo;But though it is true that
E122 analysed their data in a way that displayed the improbability
[the probability of the fit to the hybrid model was 6 &times;
10<sup>&minus;4</sup>] of a particular class of variant gauge
theories, the so-called &lsquo;hybrid models,&rsquo; I do not believe
that it would have been impossible to devise yet more variants&rdquo;
(Pickering 1991, p. 462). Pickering notes that open-ended recipes for
constructing such variants had been written down as early as 1972
(p. 467). It would have been possible to do so, but one
may ask whether or not a scientist might have wished to do so. If the
scientist agreed with Franklin&rsquo;s view that the SLAC E122 experiment provided
considerable evidential weight in support of the W-S theory and that a
set of conflicting and uncertain results from atomic parity-violation
experiments gave an equivocal answer on that support, what reason
would they have had to invent an alternative?</p>

<p>

This is not to suggest that scientists do not, or should not, engage
in speculation, but rather that there was no necessity to do so in this
case. Theorists often do propose alternatives to existing,
well-confirmed theories.</p>

<p>

Constructivist case studies always seem to result in the support of
existing, accepted theory (Pickering 1984a; 1984b; 1991; Collins 1985;
Collins and Pinch 1993). One criticism implied in such cases is that
alternatives are not considered, that the hypothesis space of
acceptable alternatives is either very small or empty. One may
seriously question this. Thus, when the experiment of
Christenson <em>et al</em>. (1964) detected \(\ce{K2^0}\)
decay into two pions, which seemed to show that CP symmetry (combined
particle-antiparticle and space inversion symmetry) was violated, no
fewer than 10 alternatives were offered. These included (1) the
cosmological model resulting from the local dysymmetry of matter and
antimatter, (2) external fields, (3) the decay of the
\(\ce{K2^0}\) into a \(\ce{K1^0}\) with the
subsequent decay of the \(\ce{K1^0}\)into two pions,
which was allowed by the symmetry, (4) the emission of another neutral
particle, &ldquo;the paritino,&rdquo; in the \(\ce{K2^0}\)
decay, similar to the emission of the neutrino in beta decay, (5) that
one of the pions emitted in the decay was in fact a
&ldquo;spion,&rdquo; a pion with spin one rather than zero, (6) that
the decay was due to another neutral particle, the L, produced
coherently with the \(\ce{K^0}\), (7) the existence of a
&ldquo;shadow&rdquo; universe, which interacted with out universe only
through the weak interactions, and that the decay seen was the decay
of the &ldquo;shadow \(\ce{K2^0}\),&rdquo; (8) the failure
of the exponential decay law, 9) the failure of the principle of
superposition in quantum mechanics, and 10) that the decay pions were
not bosons.</p>

<p>

As one can see, the limits placed on alternatives were not very
stringent. By the end of 1967, all of the alternatives had been tested
and found wanting, leaving CP symmetry unprotected. Here the differing
judgments of the scientific community about what was worth proposing
and pursuing led to a wide variety of alternatives being tested.</p>

<p>

Hacking&rsquo;s second sticking point is nominalism, or name-ism. He notes
that in its most extreme form nominalism denies that there is anything
in common or peculiar to objects selected by a name, such as &ldquo;Douglas
fir&rdquo; other than that they are called Douglas fir. Opponents contend
that good names, or good accounts of nature, tell us something correct
about the world. This is related to the realism-antirealism debate
concerning the status of unobservable entities that has plagued
philosophers for millennia. For example Bas van Fraassen (1980), an
antirealist, holds that we have no grounds for belief in unobservable
entities such as the electron and that accepting theories about the
electron means only that we believe that the things the theory says
about observables is true. A realist claims that electrons really exist
and that as, for example, Wilfred Sellars remarked, &ldquo;to have good
reason for holding a theory is <em>ipso facto</em> to have good reason
for holding that the entities postulated by the theory exist (Sellars
1962, p. 97).&rdquo; In Hacking&rsquo;s view a scientific nominalist is more
radical than an antirealist and is just as skeptical about fir trees as
they are about electrons. A nominalist further believes that the
structures we conceive of are properties of our representations of the
world and not of the world itself. Hacking refers to opponents of that
view as inherent structuralists.</p>

<p>

Hacking also remarks that this point is related to the question of
&ldquo;scientific facts.&rdquo; Thus, constructivists Latour and
Woolgar originally entitled their book <em>Laboratory Life: The Social
Construction of Scientific Facts</em> (1979). Andrew Pickering
entitled his history of the quark model <em>Constructing Quarks</em>
(Pickering 1984a).  Physicists argue that this demeans their
work. Steven Weinberg, a realist and a physicist, criticized
Pickering&rsquo;s title by noting that no mountaineer would ever name a
book <em>Constructing Everest</em>. For Weinberg, quarks and Mount
Everest have the same ontological status.  They are both facts about
the world. Hacking argues that constructivists do not, despite
appearances, believe that facts do not exist, or that there is no such
thing as reality. He cites Latour and Woolgar &ldquo;that
&lsquo;out-there-ness&rsquo; is a <em>consequence</em> of scientific work
rather than its cause (Latour and Woolgar 1986, p. 180).&rdquo;
Hacking reasonably concludes that,</p>

<blockquote>Latour and Woolgar were surely right. We should not
<em>explain</em> why some people believe that \(p\) by saying that
\(p\) is true, or corresponds to a fact, or the facts. For
example: someone believes that the universe began with what for brevity
we call a big bang. A host of reasons now supports this belief. But
after you have listed all the reasons, you should not add, as if it
were an additional reason for believing in the big bang, &lsquo;and it is
true that the universe began with a big bang.&rsquo; Or &lsquo;and it is a
fact.&rsquo;This observation has nothing peculiarly to do with social
construction. It could equally have been advanced by an old-fashioned
philosopher of language. It is a remark about the grammar of the verb
&lsquo;to explain&rsquo; (Hacking 1999, pp. 80&ndash;81).</blockquote>

<p>

One might add, however, that the reasons Hacking cites as supporting
that belief are given to us by valid experimental evidence and not by
the social and personal interests of scientists. 
Latour and Woolgar might not agree. Franklin argues that we have good
reasons to believe in facts, and in the entities involved in our
theories, always remembering, of course, that science is fallible.</p>

<p>

Hacking&rsquo;s third sticking point is the external explanations of
stability.</p>

<blockquote>The constructionist holds that explanations for the
stability of scientific belief involve, at least in part, elements that
are external to the content of science. These elements typically
include social factors, interests, networks, or however they be
described. Opponents hold that whatever be the context of discovery,
the explanation of stability is internal to the science itself (Hacking
1999, p. 92). 

<p>

Rationalists think that most science proceeds as it does in the
light of good reasons produced by research. Some bodies of knowledge
become stable because of the wealth of good theoretical and
experimental reasons that can be adduced for them. Constructivists
think that the reasons are not decisive for the course of science.
Nelson (1994) concludes that this issue will never be decided.
Rationalists, at least retrospectively, can always adduce reasons that
satisfy them. Constructivists, with equal ingenuity, can always find to
their own satisfaction an openness where the upshot of research is
settled by something other than reason. Something external. That is one
way of saying we have found an irresoluble &ldquo;sticking point&rdquo; (pp.
91&ndash;92)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Thus, there is a rather severe disagreement on the reasons for the
acceptance of experimental results. For some, like Staley, Galison and
Franklin, it is because of epistemological arguments. For others, like
Pickering, the reasons are utility for future practice and agreement
with existing theoretical commitments. Although the history of science
shows that the overthrow of a well-accepted theory leads to an enormous
amount of theoretical and experimental work, proponents of this view
seem to accept it as unproblematical that it is always agreement with
existing theory that has more future utility. Hacking and Pickering
also suggest that experimental results are accepted on the basis of the
mutual adjustment of elements which includes the theory of the
phenomenon.</p>

<p>

Nevertheless, everyone seems to agree that a consensus does arise on
experimental results.</p>

<h4 id="TheoLadeHighEnerPhys">1.3.6 Theory-ladenness in High Energy Physics</h4>

<p>

Authors like Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend put forward the view that
evidence does not confirm or refute a scientific theory since it is
laden by it. Evidence is not a set of observational sentences
autonomous from theoretical ones, as logical positivists
believed. Each new theory or a theoretical paradigm, as Kuhn labeled
larger theoretical frameworks, produces, as it were, evidence
anew.</p>

<p> Thus, theoretical concepts infect the entire experimental process
from the stage of design and preparation to the production and
analysis of data. A simple example that is supposed to convincingly
illustrate this view are measurements of temperature with a mercury
thermometer one uses in order to test whether objects expand when
their temperature increases. Note that in such a case one tests the
hypothesis by relying on the very assumption that the expansion of
mercury indicates increase in temperature.</p>

<p> There may be a fairly simple way out of the vicious circle in
which theory and experiment are caught in this particular case of
theory-ladenness. It may suffice to calibrate the mercury thermometer
with a constant volume gas thermometer, for example, where its use
does not rely on the tested hypothesis but on the proportionality of
the pressure of the gas and its absolute temperature (Franklin et
al. 1989).</p>

<p> Although most experiments are far more complex than this toy
example, one could certainly approach the view that experimental
results are theory-laden on a case-by-case basis. Yet there may be a
more general problem with the view.</p>

<p>
Bogen and Woodward (1988) argued that debate on the relationship
between theory and observation overlooks a key ingredient in the
production of experimental evidence, namely the experimental
phenomena. The experimentalists distill experimental phenomena from
raw experimental data (e.g. electronic or digital tracks in particle
colliders) using various tools of statistical analysis. Thus,
identification of an experimental phenomenon as significant (e.g. a
peak at a particular energy of colliding beams) is free of the theory
that the experiment may be designed to test (e.g. the prediction of a
particular particle). Only when significant phenomenon has been
identified can a stage of data analysis begin in which the phenomenon
is deemed to either support or refute a theory. Thus, the
theory-ladenness of evidence thesis fails at least in some experiments
in physics.</p>

<p>

The authors substantiate their argument in part through an analysis of
experiments that led to a breakthrough discovery of weak neutral
currents. It is a type of force produced by so-called bosons &mdash;
short-lived particles responsible for energy transfer between other
particles such as hadrons and leptons. The relevant peaks were
recognized as significant via statistical analysis of data, and later
on interpreted as evidence for the existence of the bosons.</p>

<p>
This view and the case study have recently been challenged by
Schindler (2011). He argues that the tested theory was critical in the
assessment of the reliability of data in the experiments with weak
neutral currents. He also points out that, on occasion, experimental
data can even be ignored if they are deemed irrelevant from a
theoretical perspective that physicists find particularly
compelling. This was the case in experiments with so-called zebra
pattern magnetic anomalies on the ocean floor. The readings of new
apparatuses used to scan the ocean floor produced intriguing
signals. Yet the researchers could not interpret these signals
meaningfully or satisfyingly distinguish them from noise unless they
relied on some theoretical account of both the structure of the ocean
floor and the earth&rsquo;s magnetic field.</p>

<p>

Karaca (2013) points out that a crude theory-observation distinction
is particularly unhelpful in understanding high-energy physics
experiments. It fails to capture the complexity of relevant
theoretical structures and their relation to experimental data.
Theoretical structures can be composed of background, model, and
phenomenological theories. Background theories are very general
theories (e.g. quantum field theory or quantum electrodynamics) that
define the general properties of physical particles and their
interactions. Models are specific instances of background theories
that define particular particles and their properties. While
phenomenological theories develop testable predictions based on these
models.</p>

<p>
Now, each of these theoretical segments stands in a different
relationship to experimental data&mdash;the experiments can be laden
by a different segment to a different extent. This requires a nuanced
categorization of theory-ladeness, from weak to strong.</p>

<p> Thus, an experimental apparatus can be designed to test a very
specific theoretical model. UA1 and UA2 detectors at CERN&rsquo;s Super
Proton Synchrotron were designed to detect particles only in a very
specific energy regime in which W and Z bosons of the Standard Model
were expected to exist.</p>

<p>
In contrast, exploratory experiments approach phenomena without
relying on a particular theoretical model. Thus, sometimes a
theoretical framework for an experiment consists of phenomenological
theory alone. Karaca argues that experiments with deep-inelastic
electron-proton scattering in the late 1960s and early 1970s are
example of such weakly theory-laden experiments. The application of
merely phenomenological parameters in the experiment resulted in the
very important discovery of the composite rather than point-like
structure of hadrons (protons and neutrons), or the so-called scaling
law. And this eventually led to a successful theoretical model of the
composition of hadrons, namely quantum chromodynamics, or the
quark-model of strong interactions.</p>

<h2 id="RoleExpe">2. The Roles of Experiment</h2>

<h3 id="LifeOwn">2.1 A Life of Its Own</h3>

<p>

Although experiment often takes its importance from its relation to
theory, Hacking pointed out that it often has a life of its own,
independent of theory. He notes the pristine observations of Carolyn
Herschel&rsquo;s discovery of comets, William Herschel&rsquo;s work on &ldquo;radiant
heat,&rdquo; and Davy&rsquo;s observation of the gas emitted by algae and the
flaring of a taper in that gas. In none of these cases did the
experimenter have any theory of the phenomenon under investigation. One
may also note the nineteenth century measurements of atomic spectra and
the work on the masses and properties on elementary particles during
the 1960s. Both of these sequences were conducted without any guidance
from theory. </p>

<p>

In deciding what experimental investigation to pursue, scientists may
very well be influenced by the equipment available and their own
ability to use that equipment (McKinney 1992). Thus, when the
Mann-O&rsquo;Neill collaboration was doing high energy physics experiments
at the Princeton-Pennsylvania Accelerator during the late 1960s, the
sequence of experiments was (1) measurement of the \(\ce{K+}\) decay
rates, (2) measurement of the \(\ce{K+_{e 3}}\) branching
ratio and decay spectrum, (3) measurement of the
\(\ce{K+_{e 2}}\) branching ratio, and (4) measurement of the
form factor in \(\ce{K+_{e 3}}\) decay. These experiments
were performed with basically the same experimental apparatus, but
with relatively minor modifications for each particular experiment. By
the end of the sequence the experimenters had become quite expert in
the use of the apparatus and knowledgeable about the backgrounds and
experimental problems. This allowed the group to successfully perform
the technically more difficult experiments later in the sequence. We
might refer to this as &ldquo;instrumental loyalty&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;recycling of expertise&rdquo; (Franklin 1997b). This meshes
nicely with Galison&rsquo;s view of experimental traditions. Scientists,
both theorists and experimentalists, tend to pursue experiments and
problems in which their training and expertise can be used.</p>

<p>

Hacking also remarks on the &ldquo;noteworthy observations&rdquo; on Iceland
Spar by Bartholin, on diffraction by Hooke and Grimaldi, and on the
dispersion of light by Newton. &ldquo;Now of course Bartholin, Grimaldi,
Hooke, and Newton were not mindless empiricists without an
&lsquo;idea&rsquo; in their heads. They saw what they saw because they
were curious, inquisitive, reflective people. They were attempting to
form theories. But in all these cases it is clear that the observations
preceded any formulation of theory&rdquo; (Hacking 1983, p. 156). In all of
these cases we may say that these were observations waiting for, or
perhaps even calling for, a theory. The discovery of any unexpected
phenomenon calls for a theoretical explanation.</p>

<h3 id="ConfRefu">2.2 Confirmation and Refutation</h3>

<p>

Nevertheless several of the important roles of experiment involve its
relation to theory. Experiment may confirm a theory, refute a theory,
or give hints to the mathematical structure of a theory. </p>

<h4 id="CrucExpeDiscPariNonc">2.2.1 A Crucial Experiment: The Discovery of Parity Nonconservation</h4>

<p>

Let us consider first an episode in which the relation between theory
and experiment was clear and straightforward. This was a &ldquo;crucial&rdquo;
experiment, one that decided unequivocally between two competing
theories, or classes of theory. The episode was that of the discovery
that parity, mirror-reflection symmetry or left-right symmetry, is not
conserved in the weak interactions. (For details of this episode see
Franklin (1986, Ch. 1) and
 <a href="app1.html" name="return-app1">Appendix 1</a>).
 Experiments showed that in the beta
decay of nuclei the number of electrons emitted in the same direction
as the nuclear spin was different from the number emitted opposite to
the spin direction. This was a clear demonstration of parity violation
in the weak interactions. </p>

<h4 id="PersExpeDiscCPViol">2.2.2 A Persuasive Experiment: The Discovery of CP Violation</h4>

<p>

After the discovery of parity and charge conjugation nonconservation,
and following a suggestion by Landau, physicists considered CP
(combined parity and particle-antiparticle symmetry), which was still
conserved in the experiments, as the appropriate symmetry. One
consequence of this scheme, if CP were conserved, was that the
\(\ce{K1^0}\) meson could decay into two pions, whereas the
\(\ce{K2^0}\) meson could
 not.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 Thus, observation of
the decay of \(\ce{K2^0}\) into two pions would indicate CP
violation. The decay was observed by a group at Princeton University.
Although several alternative explanations were offered, experiments
eliminated each of the alternatives leaving only CP violation as an
explanation of the experimental result. (For details of this episode
see Franklin (1986, Ch. 3) and
 <a href="app2.html" name="return-app2">Appendix 2</a>.)</p>
 

<h4 id="ConfAfte70YearDiscBoseEinsCond">2.2.3 Confirmation After 70 Years: The Discovery of Bose-Einstein Condensation</h4>

<p>

In both of the episodes discussed previously, those of parity
nonconservation and of CP violation, we saw a decision between two
competing classes of theories. This episode, the discovery of
Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), illustrates the confirmation of a
specific theoretical prediction 70 years after the theoretical
prediction was first made. Bose (1924) and Einstein (1924; 1925)
predicted that a gas of noninteracting bosonic atoms will, below a
certain temperature, suddenly develop a macroscopic population in the
lowest energy quantum
 state.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 (For details of this episode see
 <a href="app3.html" name="return-app3">Appendix 3</a>.)</p>
 

<h3 id="Comp">2.3 Complications</h3>

<p>

In the three episodes discussed in the previous section, the relation
between experiment and theory was clear. The experiments gave
unequivocal results and there was no ambiguity about what theory was
predicting. None of the conclusions reached has since been questioned.
Parity and CP symmetry are violated in the weak interactions and
Bose-Einstein condensation is an accepted phenomenon. In the practice
of science things are often more complex. Experimental results may be
in conflict, or may even be incorrect. Theoretical calculations may
also be in error or a correct theory may be incorrectly applied. There
are even cases in which both experiment and theory are wrong. As noted
earlier, science is fallible. In this section I will discuss
several episodes which illustrate these complexities. </p>

<h4 id="FallFiftForc">2.3.1 The Fall of the Fifth Force</h4>

<p>

The episode of the fifth force is the case of a refutation of an
hypothesis, but only after a disagreement between experimental results
was resolved. The &ldquo;Fifth Force&rdquo; was a proposed modification of Newton&rsquo;s
Law of Universal Gravitation. The initial experiments gave conflicting
results: one supported the existence of the Fifth Force whereas the
other argued against it. After numerous repetitions of the experiment,
the discord was resolved and a consensus reached that the Fifth Force
did not exist. (For details of this episode see
 <a href="app4.html" name="return-app4">Appendix 4</a>.)</p>
 

<h4 id="RighExpeWronTheoSterGerlExpe">2.3.2 Right Experiment, Wrong Theory: The Stern-Gerlach Experiment</h4>

<p>

The Stern-Gerlach experiment was regarded as crucial at the time it
was performed, but, in fact, 
 wasn&rsquo;t.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 In the view of the physics
community it decided the issue between two theories, refuting one and
supporting the other. In the light of later work, however, the
refutation stood, but the confirmation was questionable. In fact, the
experimental result posed problems for the theory it had seemingly
confirmed. A new theory was proposed and although the Stern-Gerlach
result initially also posed problems for the new theory, after a
modification of that new theory, the result confirmed it. In a sense,
it was crucial after all. It just took some time.</p>

<p>

The Stern-Gerlach experiment provides evidence for the existence of
electron spin. These experimental results were first published in 1922,
although the idea of electron spin wasn&rsquo;t proposed by Goudsmit and
Uhlenbeck until 1925 (1925; 1926). One might say that electron spin was
discovered before it was invented. (For details of this episode see
 <a href="app5.html" name="return-app5">Appendix 5</a>).</p>

<h4 id="SomeRefuDoesWorkDoubScatElec">2.3.3 Sometimes Refutation Doesn&rsquo;t Work: The Double-Scattering of Electrons</h4>

<p>

In the last section we saw some of the difficulty inherent in
experiment-theory comparison. One is sometimes faced with the question
of whether the experimental apparatus satisfies the conditions required
by theory, or conversely, whether the appropriate theory is being
compared to the experimental result. A case in point is the history of
experiments on the double-scattering of electrons by heavy nuclei (Mott
scattering) during the 1930s and the relation of these results to
Dirac&rsquo;s theory of the electron, an episode in which the question of
whether or not the experiment satisfied the conditions of the
theoretical calculation was central. Initially, experiments disagreed
with Mott&rsquo;s calculation, casting doubt on the underlying Dirac theory.
After more than a decade of work, both experimental and theoretical, it
was realized that there was a background effect in the experiments that
masked the predicted effect. When the background was eliminated
experiment and theory agreed.
 (<a href="app6.html" name="return-app6">Appendix 6</a>)</p>
 

<h4 id="FailDeteAnom">2.3.4 The Failure to Detect Anomalies</h4>

<p>

Ever vaster amounts of data have been produced by particle colliders
as they have grown from room-size apparata, to tens of kilometers long
mega-labs. Vast numbers of background interactions that are well
understood and theoretically uninteresting occur in the
detector. These have to be combed in order to identify interactions of
potential interest. This is especially true of hadron (proton-proton)
colliders like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where the Higgs boson
was discovered. Protons that collide in the LHC and similar hadron
colliders are composed of more elementary particles, collectively
labeled partons. Partons mutually interact, exponentially increasing
the number of background interactions. In fact, a minuscule number of
interactions are selected from the overwhelming number that occur in
the detector. (In contrast, lepton collisions, such as collisions of
electrons and positrons, produce much lower backgrounds, since leptons
are not composed of more elementary particles.)</p>

<p>
Thus, a successful search for new elementary particles critically
depends on successfully crafting selection criteria and techniques at
the stage of data collection and at the stage of data analysis. But
gradual development and changes in data selection procedures in the
colliders raises an important epistemological concern. The main reason
for this concern is nicely anticipated by the following question,
which was posed by one of the most prominent experimentalists in
particle physics: &ldquo;What is the extent to which we are negating the
discovery potential of very-high-energy proton machines by the
necessity of rejecting, a priori, the events we cannot afford to
record?&rdquo; (Panofsky 1994, 133). In other words, how does one decide
which interactions to detect and analyze in a multitude, in order to
minimize the possibility of throwing out novel and unexplored
ones?</p>

<p>

One way of searching through vast amounts of data that are already in,
i.e. those that the detector has already delivered, is to look for
occurrences that remain robust under varying conditions of
detection. Physicists employ the technique of data cuts in such
analysis. They cut out data that may be unreliable&mdash;when, for
instance, a data set may be an artefact rather than a genuine particle
interaction the experimenters expect. E.g. a colliding beam may
interact with the walls of the detector and not with the other
colliding beam, while producing a signal identical to the signal the
experimenters expected the beam-beam interaction to produce. Thus, if
under various data cuts a result remains stable, then it is
increasingly likely to be correct and to represent the genuine
phenomenon the physicists think it represents. The robustness of the
result under various data cuts minimizes the possibility that the
detected phenomenon only mimics the genuine one (Franklin 2013,
224&ndash;5).</p>

<p>

At the data-acquisition stage, however, this strategy does not seem
applicable. As Panofsky suggests, one does not know with certainty
which of the vast number of the events in the detector may be of
interest.</p>

<p>

Yet, Karaca
 (2011)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 argues that a form of robustness is in
play even at the acquisition stage. This experimental approach
amalgamates theoretical expectations and empirical results, as the
example of the hypothesis of specific heavy particles is supposed to
illustrate.</p>

<p>
Along with the Standard Model of particle physics, a number of
alternative models have been proposed. Their predictions of how
elementary particles should behave often differ substantially. Yet in
contrast to the Standard Model, they all share the hypothesis that
there exist heavy particles that decay into particles with high
transverse momentum.</p>

<p>Physicists apply a robustness analysis in testing this hypothesis,
the argument goes. First, they check whether the apparatus can detect
known particles similar to those predicted. Second, guided by the
hypothesis, they establish various trigger algorithms. (The trigger
algorithms, or &ldquo;the triggers&rdquo;, determine at what exact point in time
and under which conditions a detector should record interactions. They
are necessary because the frequency and the number of interactions far
exceed the limited recording capacity.) And, finally, they observe
whether any results remain stable across the triggers.</p>

<p>

Yet even in this theoretical-empirical form of robustness, as Franklin
(2013, 225) points out, &ldquo;there is an underlying assumption that any
new physics will resemble known physics&rdquo;&mdash;usually a theory of the
day. And one way around this problem is for physicists to produce as
many alternative models as possible, including those that may even
seem implausible at the time.</p>

<p>
Perovic (2011) suggests that such a potential failure, namely to spot
potentially relevant events occurring in the detector, may be also a
consequence of the gradual automation of the detection process.</p>

<p> 

The early days of experimentation in particle physics, around WWII,
saw the direct involvement of the experimenters in the
process. Experimental particle physics was a decentralized discipline
where experimenters running individual labs had full control over the
triggers and analysis. The experimenters could also control the goals
and the design of experiments. Fixed target accelerators, where the
beam hits the detector instead of another beam, produced a number of
particle interactions that was manageable for such labs. The chance of
missing an anomalous event not predicted by the current theory was not
a major concern in such an environment.</p>

<p> 

Yet such labs could process a comparatively small amount of data. This
has gradually become an obstacle, with the advent of hadron
colliders. They work at ever-higher energies and produce an
ever-vaster number of background interactions. That is why the
experimental process has become increasingly automated and much more
indirect. Trained technicians instead of experimenters themselves at
some point started to scan the recordings. Eventually, these human
scanners were replaced by computers, and a full automation of
detection in hadron colliders has enabled the processing of vast
number of interactions. This was the first significant change in the
transition from small individual labs to mega-labs.</p>

<p>
The second significant change concerned the organization and goals of
the labs. The mega-detectors and the amounts of data they produced
required exponentially more staff and scientists. This in turn led to
even more centralized and hierarchical labs and even longer periods of
design and performance of the experiments. As a result, focusing on
confirming existing dominant hypotheses rather than on exploratory
particle searches was the least risky way of achieving results that
would justify unprecedented investments.</p>

<p> Now, an indirect detection process combined with mostly
confirmatory goals is conducive to overlooking of unexpected
interactions. As such, it may impede potentially crucial theoretical
advances stemming from missed interactions.</p>

<p> 

This possibility that physicists such as Panofsky have acknowledged is
not a mere speculation. In fact, the use of semi-automated, rather
than fully-automated regimes of detection turned out to be essential
for a number of surprising discoveries that led to theoretical
breakthroughs.</p>

<p>
Perovic analyzes several such cases, most notably the discovery of the
J/psi particle that provided the first substantial piece of evidence
for the existence of the charmed quark. In the experiments, physicists
were able to perform exploratory detection and visual analysis of
practically individual interactions due to low number of background
interactions in the linear electron-positron collider. And they could
afford to do this in an energy range that the existing theory did not
recognize as significant, which led to them making the discovery. None
of this could have been done in the fully automated detecting regime
of hadron colliders that are indispensable when dealing with an
environment that contains huge numbers of background
interactions.</p>

<p>
And in some cases, such as the Fermilab experiments that aimed to
discover weak neutral currents, an automated and confirmatory regime
of data analysis contributed to the failure to detect particles that
were readily produced in the apparatus.</p>

<h4 id="LookElseEffeDiscHiggBoso">2.3.5 The &lsquo;Look Elsewhere&rsquo; Effect: Discovering the Higgs Boson</h4>

<p>
The complexity of the discovery process in particle physics does not
end with concerns about what exact data should be chosen out of the
sea of interactions. The so-called look-elsewhere effect results in a
tantalizing dilemma at the stage of data analysis.</p>

<p>
Suppose that our theory tells us that we will find a particle in an
energy range. And suppose we find a significant signal in a section of
that very range. Perhaps we should keep looking elsewhere within the
range to make sure it is not another particle altogether we have
discovered. It may be a particle that left other undetected traces in
the range that our theory does not predict, along with the trace we
found. The question is to what extent we should look elsewhere before
we reach a satisfying level of certainty that it is the predicted
particle we have discovered.</p>

<p>

Physicists faced such a dilemma during the search for the Higgs boson
at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (Dawid 2015).</p>

<p>

The Higgs boson is a particle responsible for the mass of other
particles. It is a scalar field that &ldquo;pulls back&rdquo; moving and
interacting particles. This pull, which we call mass, is different for
different particles. It is predicted by the Standard Model, whereas
alternative models predict somewhat similar Higgs-like particles.</p>

<p> 

A prediction based on the Standard Model tells us with high
probability that we will find the Higgs particle in a particular
range. Yet a simple and an inevitable fact of finding it in a
particular section of that range may prompt us to doubt whether we
have truly found the exact particle our theory predicted. Our initial
excitement may vanish when we realize that we are much more likely to
find a particle of any sort&mdash;not just the predicted
particle&mdash;within the entire range than in a particular section of
that range. Thus, the probability of finding the Higgs anywhere within
a given energy range (consisting of eighty energy &lsquo;bins&rsquo;) is much
higher than the probability of finding it at a particular energy scale
within that range (i.e. in any individual bin). In fact, the
likelihood of us finding it in a particular bin of the range is about
hundred times lower.</p>

<p>
In other words, the fact that we will inevitably find the particle in
a particular bin, not only in a particular range, decreases the
certainty that it was the Higgs we found. Given this fact alone we
should keep looking elsewhere for other possible traces in the range
once we find a significant signal in a bin. We should not proclaim the
discovery of a particle predicted by the Standard Model (or any model
for that matter) too soon. But for how long should we keep looking
elsewhere? And what level of certainty do we need to achieve before we
proclaim discovery?</p>

<p>
  
The answer boils down to the weight one gives the theory and its
predictions. This is the reason the experimentalists and theoreticians
had divergent views on the criterion for determining the precise point
at which they could justifiably state &lsquo;Our data indicate that we have
discovered the Higgs boson&rsquo;. Theoreticians were confident that a
finding within the range (any of eighty bins) that was of standard
reliability (of three or four sigma), coupled with the theoretical
expectations that Higgs would be found, would be sufficient. In
contrast, experimentalists argued that at no point of data analysis
should the pertinence of the look-elsewhere effect be reduced, and the
search proclaimed successful, with the help of the theoretical
expectations concerning Higgs. One needs to be as careful in combing
the range as one practically may. As a result, the experimentalists&rsquo;
preferred value of sigmas for announcing the discovery was five. This
is a standard under which very few findings have turned out to be a
fluctuation in the past.</p>

<p>
Dawid argues that a question of an appropriate statistical analysis of
data is at the heart of the dispute. The reasoning of the
experimentalists relied on a frequentist approach that does not
specify the probability of the tested hypothesis. It actually isolates
statistical analysis of data from the prior probabilities. The
theoreticians, however, relied on Bayesian analysis. It starts with
prior probabilities of initial assumptions and ends with the
assessment of the probability of tested hypothesis based on the
collected evidence. The question remains whether the experimentalists&rsquo;
reasoning was fully justified. The prior expectations that the
theoreticians had included in their analysis had already been
empirically corroborated by previous experiments after all.</p>

<h3 id="SomeThouExpeBiol">2.5 Some Thoughts on Experiment in Biology</h3>

<h4 id="EpisStraPeppMothExpe">2.5.1 Epistemological Strategies and the Peppered Moth Experiment</h4>

<p>

One comment that has been made concerning the philosophy of
experiment is that all of the examples are taken from physics and are
therefore limited. In this section arguments will be presented that these
discussions also apply to biology.</p>

<p>

Although all of the illustrations of the epistemology of experiment
come from physics, David Rudge (1998; 2001) has shown that they are
also used in biology. His example is Kettlewell&rsquo;s (1955; 1956;
1958) evolutionary biology experiments on the Peppered Moth, <em>Biston
betularia</em>. The <em>typical</em> form of the moth has a pale
speckled appearance and there are two darker forms, f.
<em>carbonaria</em>, which is nearly black, and f. <em>insularia</em>,
which is intermediate in color. The <em>typical</em> form of the moth
was most prevalent in the British Isles and Europe until the middle of
the nineteenth century. At that time things began to change. Increasing
industrial pollution had both darkened the surfaces of trees and rocks
and had also killed the lichen cover of the forests downwind of
pollution sources. Coincident with these changes, naturalists had found
that rare, darker forms of several moth species, in particular the
Peppered Moth, had become common in areas downwind of pollution
sources.</p>

<p>

Kettlewell attempted to test a selectionist explanation of this
phenomenon. E.B. Ford (1937; 1940) had suggested a two-part explanation
of this effect: 1) darker moths had a superior physiology and 2) the
spread of the melanic gene was confined to industrial areas because the
darker color made <em>carbonaria</em> more conspicuous to avian
predators in rural areas and less conspicuous in polluted areas.
Kettlewell believed that Ford had established the superior viability of
darker moths and he wanted to test the hypothesis that the darker form
of the moth was less conspicuous to predators in industrial areas.</p>

<p>

Kettlewell&rsquo;s investigations consisted of three parts. In the
first part he used human observers to investigate whether his proposed
scoring method would be accurate in assessing the relative
conspicuousness of different types of moths against different
backgrounds. The tests showed that moths on &ldquo;correct&rdquo;
backgrounds, <em>typical</em> on lichen covered backgrounds and dark
moths on soot-blackened backgrounds were almost always judged
inconspicuous, whereas moths on &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; backgrounds
were judged conspicuous.</p>

<p>

The second step involved releasing birds into a cage containing all
three types of moth and both soot-blackened and lichen covered pieces
of bark as resting places. After some difficulties (see Rudge 1998 for
details), Kettlewell found that birds prey on moths in an order of
conspicuousness similar to that gauged by human observers.</p>

<p>

The third step was to investigate whether birds preferentially prey
on conspicuous moths in the wild. Kettlewell used a
mark-release-recapture experiment in both a polluted environment
(Birmingham) and later in an unpolluted wood. He released 630 marked
male moths of all three types in an area near Birmingham, which
contained predators and natural boundaries. He then recaptured the
moths using two different types of trap, each containing virgin females
of all three types to guard against the possibility of pheromone
differences.</p>

<p>

Kettlewell found that <em>carbonaria</em> was twice as likely to
survive in soot-darkened environments (27.5 percent) as was
<em>typical</em> (12.7 percent). He worried, however, that his results
might be an artifact of his experimental procedures. Perhaps the traps
used were more attractive to one type of moth, that one form of moth
was more likely to migrate, or that one type of moth just lived longer.
He eliminated the first alternative by showing that the recapture rates
were the same for both types of trap. The use of natural boundaries and
traps placed beyond those boundaries eliminated the second, and
previous experiments had shown no differences in longevity. Further
experiments in polluted environments confirmed that <em>carbonaria</em>
was twice as likely to survive as <em>typical.</em> An experiment in an
unpolluted environment showed that <em>typical</em> was three times as
likely to survive as <em>carbonaria</em>. Kettlewell concluded that
such selection was the cause of the prevalence of <em>carbonaria</em>
in polluted environments.</p>

<p>

Rudge also demonstrates that the strategies used by Kettlewell are
those described above in the epistemology of experiment. His examples
are given in Table 1. (For more details see Rudge 1998).</p>

<h4 id="MeseStahExpeMostBeauExpeBiol">2.5.2 The Meselson-Stahl Experiment: &ldquo;The Most Beautiful Experiment in Biology&rdquo;</h4>

<p>

The roles that experiment plays in physics are also those it plays
in biology. In the previous section we have seen that
Kettlewell&rsquo;s experiments both test and confirm a theory. I
discussed earlier a set of crucial experiments that decided between two
competing classes of theories, those that conserved parity and those
that did not. In this section I will discuss an experiment that decided
among three competing mechanisms for the replication of DNA, the
molecule now believed to be responsible for heredity. This is another
crucial experiment. It strongly supported one proposed mechanism and
argued against the other two. (For details of this episode see (Holmes
2001)).</p>

<p>

In 1953 Francis Crick and James Watson proposed a three-dimensional
structure for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (Watson and Crick 1953a).
Their proposed structure consisted of two polynucleotide chains
helically wound about a common axis. This was the famous &ldquo;Double
Helix&rdquo;. The chains were bound together by combinations of four
nitrogen bases &mdash; adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. Because of
structural requirements only the base pairs adenine-thymine and
cytosine-guanine are allowed. Each chain is thus complementary to the
other. If there is an adenine base at a location in one chain there is
a thymine base at the same location on the other chain, and vice versa.
The same applies to cytosine and guanine. The order of the bases along
a chain is not, however, restricted in any way, and it is the precise
sequence of bases that carries the genetic information.</p>

<p>

The significance of the proposed structure was not lost on Watson
and Crick when they made their suggestion. They remarked, &ldquo;It has
not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated
immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic
material.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

If DNA was to play this crucial role in genetics, then there must be
a mechanism for the replication of the molecule. Within a short period
of time following the Watson-Crick suggestion, three different
mechanisms for the replication of the DNA molecule were proposed
(Delbruck and Stent 1957). These are illustrated in Figure A. The
first, proposed by Gunther Stent and known as conservative replication,
suggested that each of the two strands of the parent DNA molecule is
replicated in new material. This yields a first generation which
consists of the original parent DNA molecule and one newly-synthesized
DNA molecule. The second generation will consist of the parental DNA
and three new DNAs.</p>

<div class="figure">
<img src="figA.jpg" alt="Possible mechanisms for DNA replication" width="550" />
<p><span class="figlabel">Figure A:</span>
Possible mechanisms for DNA replication. (Left) Conservative
replication. Each of the two strands of the parent DNA is replicated to
yield the unchanged parent DNA and one newly synthesized DNA. The
second generation consists of one parent DNA and three new DNAs.
(Center) Semiconservative replication. Each first generation DNA
molecule contains one strand of the parent DNA and one newly
synthesized strand. The second generation consists of two hybrid DNAs
and two new DNAs. (Right) Dispersive replication. The parent chains
break at intervals, and the parental segments combine with new segments
to form the daughter chains. The darker segments are parental DNA and
the lighter segments are newly synthesized DNA. From Lehninger
(1975).</p>
</div>

<p>

The second proposed mechanism, known as semiconservative replication
is when each strand of the parental DNA acts as a template for a second
newly-synthesized complementary strand, which then combines with the
original strand to form a DNA molecule. This was proposed by Watson and
Crick (1953b). The first generation consists of two hybrid molecules,
each of which contains one strand of parental DNA and one newly
synthesized strand. The second generation consists of two hybrid
molecules and two totally new DNAs. The third mechanism, proposed by
Max Delbruck, was dispersive replication, in which the parental DNA
chains break at intervals and the parental segments combine with new
segments to form the daughter strands.</p>

<p>

In this section the experiment performed by Matthew Meselson and
Franklin Stahl, which has been called &ldquo;the most beautiful
experiment in biology&rdquo;, and which was designed to answer the
question of the correct DNA replication mechanism will be discussed
(Meselson and Stahl 1958). Meselson and Stahl described their proposed
method. &ldquo;We anticipated that a label which imparts to the DNA
molecule an increased density might permit an analysis of this
distribution by sedimentation techniques. To this end a method was
developed for the detection of small density differences among
macromolecules. By use of this method, we have observed the
distribution of the heavy nitrogen isotope \(\ce{^{15}N}\) among
molecules of DNA following the transfer of a uniformly
\(\ce{^{15}N}\)-labeled, exponentially growing bacterial population to
a growth medium containing the ordinary nitrogen isotope
\(\ce{^{14}N}\)&rdquo; (Meselson and Stahl 1958, pp. 671&ndash;672).</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break">
<img src="figB.jpg" alt="Meselson-Stahl schematic" width="500" />
<p><span class="figlabel">Figure B:</span>
Schematic representation of the Meselson-Stahl experiment. From Watson
(1965).</p>
</div>

<p>

The experiment is described schematically in Figure B. Meselson and
Stahl placed a sample of DNA in a solution of cesium chloride. As the
sample is rotated at high speed the denser material travels further
away from the axis of rotation than does the less dense material. This
results in a solution of cesium chloride that has increasing density as
one goes further away from the axis of rotation. The DNA reaches
equilibrium at the position where its density equals that of the
solution. Meselson and Stahl grew <em>E. coli</em> bacteria in a medium
that contained ammonium chloride \((\ce{NH4Cl})\) as the sole source
of nitrogen. They did this for media that contained either
\(\ce{^{14}N}\), ordinary nitrogen, or \(\ce{^{15}N}\), a heavier
isotope. By destroying the cell membranes they could obtain samples of
DNA which contained either 
\(\ce{^{14}N}\) or \(\ce{^{15}N}\). They first
showed that they could indeed separate the two different mass molecules
of DNA by centrifugation (Figure C). The separation of the two
types of DNA is clear in both the photograph obtained by absorbing
ultraviolet light and in the graph showing the intensity of the signal,
obtained with a densitometer. In addition, the separation between the
two peaks suggested that they would be able to distinguish an
intermediate band composed of hybrid DNA from the heavy and light
bands. These early results argued both that the experimental apparatus
was working properly and that all of the results obtained were correct.
It is difficult to imagine either an apparatus malfunction or a source
of experimental background that could reproduce those results. This is
similar, although certainly not identical, to Galileo&rsquo;s
observation of the moons of Jupiter or to Millikan&rsquo;s measurement
of the charge of the electron. In both of those episodes it was the
results themselves that argued for their correctness.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>

Meselson and Stahl then produced a sample of <em>E coli</em>
bacteria containing only \(\ce{^{15}N}\) by growing it in a medium
containing only ammonium chloride with \(\ce{^{15}N}\)
\((\ce{^{15}NH4Cl})\) for fourteen generations. They then
abruptly changed the medium to \(\ce{^{14}N}\) by adding a tenfold
excess of \(\ce{^{14}NH_4Cl}\). Samples were taken just before
the addition of \(\ce{^{14}N}\) and at intervals afterward for several
generations. The cell membranes were broken to release the DNA into the
solution and the samples were centrifuged and ultraviolet absorption
photographs taken. In addition, the photographs were scanned with a
recording densitometer. The results are shown in Figure D,
showing both the photographs and the densitometer traces. The figure
shows that one starts only with heavy (fully-labeled) DNA. As time
proceeds one sees more and more half-labeled DNA, until at one
generation time only half-labeled DNA is present. &ldquo;Subsequently
only half labeled DNA and completely unlabeled DNA are found. When two
generation times have elapsed after the addition of \(\ce{^{14}N}\)
half-labeled and unlabeled DNA are present in equal amounts&rdquo; (p.
676). (This is exactly what the semiconservative replication mechanism
predicts). By four generations the sample consists almost entirely of
unlabeled DNA. A test of the conclusion that the DNA in the
intermediate density band was half labeled was provided by examination
of a sample containing equal amounts of generations 0 and 1.9. If the
semiconservative mechanism is correct then Generation 1.9 should have
approximately equal amounts of unlabeled and half-labeled DNA, whereas
Generation 0 contains only fully-labeled DNA. As one can see, there are
three clear density bands and Meselson and Stahl found that the
intermediate band was centered at \((50 \pm 2)\) percent of the difference
between the \(\ce{^{14}N}\) and \(\ce{^{15}N}\) bands, shown in the
bottom photograph (Generations 0 and 4.1). This is precisely what one
would expect if that DNA were half labeled.</p>

photographs. The initial sample is all heavy (\(\ce{^{15}N}\) DNA). As
time proceeds a second intermediate band begins to appear until at one

sample is almost all lighter DNA. This is exactly what is predicted by
the Watson-Crick semiconservative mechanism. From Meselson and Stahl
(1958)</p>
</div>

<p>

Meselson and Stahl stated their results as follows, &ldquo;The
nitrogen of DNA is divided equally between two subunits which remain
intact through many generations&hellip;. Following replication,
each daughter molecule has received one parental subunit&rdquo; (p.
676).</p>

<p>

Meselson and Stahl also noted the implications of their work
for deciding among the proposed mechanisms for DNA replication. In a
section labeled &ldquo;The Watson-Crick Model&rdquo; they noted that,
&ldquo;This [the structure of the DNA molecule] suggested to Watson and
Crick a definite and structurally plausible hypothesis for the
duplication of the DNA molecule. According to this idea, the two chains
separate, exposing the hydrogen-bonding sites of the bases. Then, in
accord with base-pairing restrictions, each chain serves as a template
for the synthesis of its complement. Accordingly, each daughter
molecule contains one of the parental chains paired with a newly
synthesized chain&hellip;. The results of the present experiment are
in exact accord with the expectations of the Watson-Crick model for DNA
replication&rdquo; (pp. 677&ndash;678).</p>

<p>

It also showed that the dispersive replication mechanism proposed by
Delbruck, which had smaller subunits, was incorrect. &ldquo;Since the
apparent molecular weight of the subunits so obtained is found to be
close to half that of the intact molecule, it may be further concluded
that the subunits of the DNA molecule which are conserved at
duplication are single, continuous structures. The scheme for DNA
duplication proposed by Delbruck is thereby ruled out&rdquo; (p. 681).
Later work by John Cairns and others showed that the subunits of DNA
were the entire single polynucleotide chains of the Watson-Crick model
of DNA structure.</p>

<p>

The Meselson-Stahl experiment is a crucial experiment in biology. It
decided between three proposed mechanisms for the replication of DNA.
It supported the Watson-Crick semiconservative mechanism and eliminated
the conservative and dispersive mechanisms. It played a similar role in
biology to that of the experiments that demonstrated the
nonconservation of parity did in physics. Thus, we have seen evidence
that experiment plays similar roles in both biology and physics and

disciplines.</p>

<h3 id="CompSimuExpe">2.6 Computer Simulations and Experimentation</h3>

<p>

One interesting recent development in science, and thus in the
philosophy of science, has been the increasing use of, and importance
of, computer simulations. In some fields, such as high-energy physics,
simulations are an essential part of all experiments. It is fair to
say that without computer simulations these experiments would be
impossible. There has been a considerable literature in the philosophy
of science discussing whether computer simulations are experiments,
theory, or some new kind of hybrid method of doing science. But, as
Eric Winsberg remarked, &ldquo;We have in other words, rejected the
overly conservative intuition that computer simulation is nothing but
boring and straightforward theory application. But we have avoided
embracing the opposite, overly grandiose intuition that simulation is
a radically new kind of knowledge production, &rdquo;on a par&ldquo;
with experimentation. In fact, we have seen that soberly locating
simulation &rdquo;on the methodological map&ldquo; is not a simple
matter (Winsberg 2010, p. 136).&rdquo; </p>

<p>

Given the importance of computer simulations in science it is
essential that we have good reasons to believe their results. Eric
Winsberg (2010), Wendy Parker (2008) and others have shown that
scientists use strategies quite similar to those discussed in Section
1.1.1, to argue for the correctness of computer simulations.

<h3 id="ExpeObse">2.7 Experiment and Observation</h3>

<p>
The distinction between observation and experiment is relatively
little discussed in philosophical literature, despite its continuous
relevance to the scientific community and beyond in understanding
specific traits and segments of the scientific process and the
knowledge it produces.</p>

<p>
Daston and her coauthors (Daston 2011; Daston and Lunbeck 2011; Daston
and Galison 2007) have convincingly demonstrated that the distinction
has played a role in delineating various features of scientific
practice. It has helped scientists articulate their reflections on
their own practice.</p>

<p>
Observation is philosophically a loaded term, yet the epistemic status
of scientific observation has evolved gradually with the advance of
scientific techniques of inquiry and the scientific communities
pursuing them. Daston succinctly summarizes this evolution in the
following passage:</p>

<blockquote>
Characteristic of the emergent epistemic genre of the observations
was, first, an emphasis on singular events, witnessed first hand
(autopsia) by a named author (in contrast to the accumulation of
anonymous data over centuries described by Cicero and Pliny as typical
of observationes); second, a deliberate effort to separate observation
from conjecture (in contrast to the medieval Scholastic connection of
observation with the conjectural sciences, such as astrology); and
third, the creation of virtual communities of observers dispersed over
time and space, who communicated and pooled their observations in
letters and publications (in contrast to passing them down from father
to son or teacher to student as rare and precious treasures). (2011,
81)</blockquote>

<p>
Observation gradually became juxtaposed to other, more complex modes
of inquiry such as experiment, &ldquo;whose meaning shifted from the
broad and heterogeneous sense of experimentum as recipe, trial, or
just common experience to a concertedly artificial manipulation, often
using special instruments and designed to probe hidden causes&rdquo;
(Daston 2011, 82).</p>

<p>
In the 17th century, observation and experiment were seen as &ldquo;an
inseparable pair&rdquo; (Daston 2011, 82) and by the 19th century they were
understood to be essentially opposed, with the observer increasingly
seen as passive and thus epistemically inferior to the
experimenter. In fact, already Leibniz anticipated this view stating
that &ldquo;[t]here are certain experiments that would be better called
observations, in which one considers rather than produces the work&rdquo;
(Daston 2011, 86). This aspect of the distinction has been a mainstay
of understanding scientific practice ever since.</p>

<p>
Apart from this historical analysis, there are currently two prominent
and opposed views of the experiment-observation distinction. Ian
Hacking has characterized it as well-defined, while avoiding the claim
that observation and experiment are opposites (Hacking 1983,
173). According to him, the notions signify different things in
scientific practice. The experiment is a thorough manipulation that
creates a new phenomenon, and observation of the phenomenon is its
outcome. If scientists can manipulate a domain of nature to such an
extent that they can create a new phenomenon in a lab, a phenomenon
that normally cannot be observed in nature, then they have truly
observed the phenomenon (Hacking 1989, 1992).</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, other authors concur that &ldquo;the familiar distinction between
observation and experiment &hellip; [is] an artefact of the
disembodied, reconstructed character of retrospective accounts&rdquo;
(Gooding 1992, 68). The distinction &ldquo;collapses&rdquo; when we are faced with
actual scientific practice as a process, and &ldquo;Hacking&rsquo;s observation
versus experiment framework does not survive intact when put to the
test in a range of cases of scientific experimentation&rdquo; (Malik 2017,
85).  First, the uses of the distinction cannot be compared across
scientific fields. And second, as Gooding (1992) suggests, observation
is a process too, not simply a static result of manipulation. Thus,
both observation and experiment are seen as concurrent processes
blended together in scientific practice.</p>

<p>
Malik (2017, 86) states that these arguments are the reason why &ldquo;very
few [authors] use Hacking&rsquo;s nomenclature of observation/experiment&rdquo;
and goes so far to conclude that &ldquo;to (try to) distinguish between
observation and experiment is futile.&rdquo; There is no point delineating
the two except perhaps in certain narrow domains; e.g., Hacking&rsquo;s
notion of the experiment based on creating phenomena might be useful
within a narrow domain of particle physics. (See also Chang 2011.) He
advocates avoiding the distinction altogether and opting for &ldquo;the
terminology [that] underlines this sense of continuousness&rdquo; (Malik
2017, 88) instead. If we want to analyze scientific practice, the
argument goes, we should leave behind the idea of the distinction as
fundamental and turn to the characterization and analysis of various
&ldquo;epistemic activities&rdquo; instead, e.g., along the lines suggested by
Chang (2011).</p>

<p>
A rather obvious danger of this approach is an over-emphasis on the
continuousness of the notions of observation and experiment that
results in inadvertent equivocation. And this, in turn, results in
sidelining the distinction and its subtleties in the analysis of the
scientific practice, despite their crucial role in articulating and
developing that practice since the 17th century. This issue certainly
requires further philosophical and historical analysis.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">3. Conclusion</h2>

<p>

In this entry varying views on the nature of experimental results have
been presented. Some argue that the acceptance of experimental results
is based on epistemological arguments, whereas others base acceptance
on future utility, social interests, or agreement with existing
community commitments. Everyone agrees , however, that for whatever
reasons, a consensus is reached on experimental results. These results
then play many important roles in physics and we have examined several
of these roles, although certainly not all of them. We have seen
experiment deciding between two competing theories, calling for a new
theory, confirming a theory, refuting a theory, providing evidence that
determined the mathematical form of a theory, and providing evidence
for the existence of an elementary particle involved in an accepted
theory. We have also seen that experiment has a life of its own,
independent of theory. If, as I believe, epistemological procedures
provide grounds for reasonable belief in experimental results, then
experiment can legitimately play the roles I have discussed and can
provide the basis for scientific knowledge. </p>

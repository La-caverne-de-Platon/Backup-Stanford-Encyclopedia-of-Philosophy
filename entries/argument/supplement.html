<h2>Historical Supplement: Argumentation in the history of philosophy</h2>

<p>
Arguments and argumentation figure prominently in most (if not all)
influential philosophical traditions. This Supplement presents
argumentation as discussed in five prominent traditions from the past:
ancient Greek, classical Indian, classical Chinese, medieval Latin,
and medieval Islamicate philosophy. The goal is not to present an
exhaustive historical account of these developments, but rather to
offer a sample of reflections on argumentation in five noteworthy
philosophical traditions.</p>

<h3 id="AnciTrad">1. Ancient Traditions</h3>

<h4 id="Gree">1.1 Greece</h4>

<p>
Argumentative practices in ancient Greece constitute one of the main
historical examples of a well-developed argumentative tradition
(Dutilh Novaes 2020: ch. 5). The relevant sociopolitical background is
that of Athenian democracy (508 to 322 BCE), where citizens could
participate in decisions pertaining to governance of the city (M.
Hansen 1977&ndash;81 [1991]). The three main political bodies were the
assembly, the boule, and the courts of law; in all three, decisions
were reached on the basis of extensive debates. Thus, being a
persuasive orator was of paramount importance for a citizen, both to
obtain votes in the assembly and to argue for a legal case in
court.</p>

<p>
In this setting, those who could train citizens to become skilled
orators had something immensely valuable to offer. Many of the
well-known thinkers of this period were exactly that: itinerant
professional teachers who became collectively known as the
<em>Sophists</em> (Notomi 2014; see entry on the
 <a href="../sophists/index.html">Sophists</a>).
 But with the end of the so-called golden age of Athenian democracy
and the disastrous results of the Peloponnesian Wars (431&ndash;404
BCE) for Athens, this mode of discursive engagement came to be
criticized as a sign of the failure of democracy as a political
system. Plato famously (and somewhat unfairly) offers harsh criticism
of the Sophists in his dialogues (e.g., the <em>Gorgias</em>, the
<em>Republic</em>; see entry on
 <a href="../plato/index.html">Plato</a>):
 according to Plato, they only aim at shallow persuasion rather than
at the truth (Irani 2017).</p>

<p>
Plato promotes a different style of argumentative discourse: instead
of the long speeches of the rhetoricians, and following his teacher
Socrates (see entry on
 <a href="../socrates/index.html">Socrates</a>),
 he favors dialogical interactions where speakers take turns in quick
succession, in what became known as <em>dialectical encounters</em>.
Dialectic seems to have predated Socrates and Plato, as the Eleatic
philosophers (Parmenides, Zeno) were apparently already practitioners
of this kind of discourse (Casteln&eacute;rac &amp; Marion 2009; see
entry on
 <a href="../zeno-elea/index.html">Zeno of Elea</a>).
 But Plato was arguably the first to reflect and theorize on these
different styles of argumentation.</p>

<p>
What does a dialectical encounter look like, concretely? There are a
number of detailed reconstructions of the basic features of this
practice in the literature (Casteln&eacute;rac &amp; Marion 2009; Fink
2012). Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Topics</em> and its &ldquo;ninth
chapter&rdquo;, the <em>Sophistical Refutations</em>, may be read as
the (presumably) first regimentation/systematization of these
practices, thus providing support for a general description
thereof:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
First of all there are the agents: the questioner and the answerer.
There may also have been an audience (<em>Sophistical Refutations</em>
16 175a20&ndash;30). The questioner has two main jobs: first, to
extract a thesis, the &ldquo;starting point&rdquo; for the debate from
the answerer; second, to try to force the answerer to admit the
contradictory of that starting point, by getting the answerer to agree
to certain premises. Alternatively, the questioner can try to reduce
the thesis to absurdity. In either case, the questioner aims to refute
the answerer. Crucially, the starting point should be something that
can be affirmed or denied (<em>Topics</em> 8.2. 158a14&ndash;22). For
example, &ldquo;what is knowledge?&rdquo; would not be allowed as a
starting point, as the answerer cannot reply &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or
&ldquo;no&rdquo;. The answerer, on the other hand, has only one task,
which is to remain un-refuted within a fixed time (<em>Topics</em>
8.10. 161a1&ndash;15). If the answerer is refuted, then the answer
should make clear that it is not their fault, but is due solely to the
starting point (<em>Topics</em> 8.4. 159a18&ndash;22) (Duncombe &amp;
Dutilh Novaes 2016: 3).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A key component of dialectic is the concept of <em>refutation</em>, or
<em>elenchus</em> in Greek: questioner aims at refutation, answerer
tries to avoid being refuted. Readers of Plato will recall the
numerous instances where Socrates, by means of questions, elicits
various discursive commitments from his interlocutors, only to show
that, taken together, these commitments are incoherent. The
interlocutor is thus <em>refuted</em>, and must revise their previous
discursive commitments so as to restore coherence. But beyond these
basic details, there is much discussion in the literature on how best
to understand the concept of <em>elenchus</em> (Wolfsdorf 2013).</p>

<p>
Practices of dialectic provided the background for the emergence of
the first fully-fledged logical system in history, Aristotle&rsquo;s
syllogistic, as described in the <em>Prior Analytics</em> (Dutilh
Novaes 2020: ch. 6; see entry on
 <a href="../aristotle-logic/index.html">Aristotle&rsquo;s logic</a>).
 Syllogistic differs from dialectic more generally in that it views as
valid only arguments having the property of necessary
truth-preservation (i.e., deductive arguments), whereas dialectic also
allows for inductive and analogical arguments (as attested by the wide
range of arguments used in Plato&rsquo;s dialogues). But Aristotle
remained equally interested in dialectic more generally, as attested
by his manuals on how to argue well in dialectical encounters, the
<em>Topics</em> and the <em>Sophistical Refutations</em>, and by the
extensive discussions on dialectic even in the <em>Prior
Analytics</em>. A key concept introduced by Aristotle in the
<em>Sophistical Refutations</em> is that of <em>fallacies</em>, i.e.,
arguments that appear correct but are ultimately incorrect, thus
leading to faulty conclusions (see entry on
 <a href="../fallacies/index.html">fallacies</a>).
 For millennia (and to this day), the identification and study of
fallacies remained one of the main instruments to study
argumentation.</p>

<p>
Plato and Aristotle were not the only Greek thinkers interested in
dialectic (see entry on the
 <a href="../dialectical-school/index.html">dialectical school</a>).
 Later authors continued to discuss the concept of dialectic, even if
it acquired different meanings for different authors and traditions
(see entry on
 <a href="../logic-ancient/index.html">ancient logic</a>).
 The Stoics are particularly worth mentioning, as they are credited
with developing the first fully-fledged propositional logic, where the
validity of arguments is analyzed by means of schemata where numbers
take the place of propositions (whereas in Aristotle&rsquo;s
syllogistic, letters take the place of terms). Modus Ponens, for
example, was formulated by the Stoics as: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If the 1<sup>st</sup>, then the 2<sup>nd</sup>. But the
1<sup>st</sup>, therefore the 2<sup>nd</sup> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(See entry on
 <a href="../logic-ancient/index.html">ancient logic</a>.)
 In sum, a concern with rational discourse and argumentation was a
constant element in ancient Greek philosophy, from the early stages
with pre-Socratic thinkers all the way until late antiquity.</p>

<h4 id="Indi">1.2 India</h4>

<p>
The classical Indian tradition shares with the ancient Greek tradition
the pervasiveness of debating practices. In fact, it might seem that
Indian thinkers relished engaging in lively debates even more than
their Greek peers, as attested by their sophisticated reflections on
argumentation (both for instruction and practice, and as theoretical
investigations; Matilal 1998: chs 2 and 3; Solomon 1976). As is well
known, classical Indian philosophy is extremely diverse, branching
into a plethora of schools. These essentially fall within two groups:
Brahmanical schools, which accepted the validity of the Vedic sacred
texts (such as Ny&#257;ya and Yoga), and schools that rejected the
authority of the Vedas (such as Buddhism and Jainism). There was much
disagreement among these different schools, thus generating ample
opportunity for lively discussions.</p>

<p>
While the emergence of sustained debating practices in ancient Greece
was greatly influenced by the political background, in India debating
practices emerged as a response to different circumstances, in
particular to address metaphysical, epistemological and religious
issues (see entry on
 <a href="../epistemology-india/index.html">epistemology in classical Indian philosophy</a>).
 The historical record suggests that kings and rulers encouraged and
patronized such debates between sages, thus providing an
institutional, social embedding quite different from the background
for intellectual endeavors in ancient Greece. On the whole, while the
Greeks were primarily interested in moral and political issues, Indian
thinkers mainly focused on ontological, epistemological, medical, and
religious questions such as the distinction of the soul from the body,
the purpose of life, the different sources of knowledge, and the
existence of the after-life (Matilal 1998; though these discussions
also had moral implications).</p>

<p>
The popularity of debates dates back to the early stages in the
history of Indian thought (as early as 1700 BCE), but the first
theories of argumentation only appeared around the time of the Buddha
and other religious reformers (6<sup>th</sup> century BCE). By the
third and second centuries BCE, monks and Brahmans were required to
have training in the art of debating. Debating manuals were written
within the different sectarian schools (Matilal 1998), containing
accounts of highly regimented debating practices displaying the same
level of sophistication (if not beyond) as Greek dialectic (see entry
on
 <a href="../logic-india/index.html">logic in classical Indian philosophy</a>).
 The Indian authors distinguished between friendly, honest debates,
where presumably the common goal was the search for truth, from
competitive ones where the goal was mere victory. In the influential
<em>Ny&#257;ya-s&#363;tra</em> manual, attributed to
Ak&#7779;ap&#257;da Gautama and widely available by 150 CE (exact
dates of composition are uncertain), the former were called
<em>v&#257;da</em>, while the latter were called <em>jalpa</em> and
<em>vita&#7751;&#7693;&#257;</em> (Nicholson 2010). These manuals
contained instructions on how to perform at honest debates as well as
discussions of clever argumentative tricks that may be used by
disputatious opponents in competitive debates, so as to help the
novice to identify and rebut these tricks (Prets 2001). In particular,
Indian philosophers also developed sophisticated theories of fallacies
(Phillips 2017) that served purposes similar to Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Sophistical Refutations</em> (Ganeri 2001).</p>

<p>
Indian philosophical discussions also tend to have a strong
epistemological focus, with a concern for the nature of evidence and
discussions on the means of knowledge, <em>pram&#257;&#7751;a</em>s
(see entry on
 <a href="../epistemology-india/index.html">epistemology in classical Indian philosophy</a>).
 The <em>Ny&#257;ya-s&#363;tra</em>, for example, can be read as
offering a formulation of acceptable and sound methods for
philosophical discourse and inquiry. Inference (<em>anum&#257;na</em>)
was viewed by the Ny&#257;ya philosophers (as well as by other schools
of thought) as one of the <em>pram&#257;&#7751;a</em>s, one of the
means of knowledge. But Indian thinkers saw no contradiction between
dialectical and epistemological approaches; as is clear in particular
in the works of the influential fifth&ndash;sixth century CE Buddhist
thinker Dign&#257;ga, inference&mdash;the cognitive process taking one
from the known to the unknown&mdash;and argument&mdash;a device of
persuasion&mdash;are but two sides of a single coin (see entry on
 <a href="../logic-india/index.html#ClasPeri">logic in classical Indian philosophy, section 4</a>).</p>
 
<p>
There is much discussion among scholars on whether earlier Indian
thinkers did or did not draw a sharp distinction between (what we now
call) deductive and inductive reasoning (Siderits 2003), and between
monotonic and non-monotonic reasoning (Taber 2004). Inferential
knowledge was typically viewed as the product of repeated observations
of individual cases, and many authors from the earlier period seemed
to view these inferences as sufficiently reliable; an exception were
some skeptical thinkers, who emphasized precisely the fact that these
inferences were not necessarily truth-preserving (Matilal 1998;
Siderits 2003). By contrast, later authors, in particular
Dign&#257;ga, explicitly recognized arguments having the property of
necessary truth-preservation as comprising a special class of
arguments. Indeed, over the centuries theories and practices of
argumentation in the Indian tradition continued to evolve, thus
offering much valuable material for those interested in the history of
theories of argumentation.</p>

<h4 id="Chin">1.3 China</h4>

<p>
Chinese intellectuals were also deeply interested in argumentation (C.
Hansen 1983), a practice described as <em>bi&agrave;n</em> or
<em>bi&agrave;n shu&#333;</em> in classical Chinese texts. In
particular, the thinkers associated with the &ldquo;School of
Names&rdquo; were especially keen on disputations, including idle
contests of wits (at least according to their critics). Indeed, some
of these thinkers have been described as the &ldquo;Chinese
sophists&rdquo;, given the (at least superficial) similarities with
the Greek sophists (see entry on the
 <a href="../school-names/index.html">School of Names</a>).
 Moreover, Chinese thinkers also dealt with contexts of &ldquo;mass
persuasion&rdquo;, that is persuasion of large groups of people (even
if they were not fellow citizens like in Greece), such as groups of
followers of different masters.</p>

<p>
<em>Bi&agrave;n</em> is in fact a more general concept, its core
meaning pertaining to drawing distinctions, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
as a verb referring to the act of distinguishing or discriminating
things from each other and as a noun referring to distinctions.
(Fraser 2013: 4) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But for these classical Chinese thinkers, a debate or argument is in
fact an activity primarily aimed at <em>drawing distinctions</em>,
hence the secondary meaning the term acquired as referring to
disputation and argument. Essentially, the question in a disputation
is usually whether a given name is suitably applied to a given object
(or event), as revealed by a passage from the Mohist Dialectics (A74,
as cited in the entry on
 <a href="../mohist-canons/notes.html#note-25">Mohist canons (note 25)</a>):</p>
 
<blockquote>

<p>
Canon: <em>Bi&agrave;n</em> is contending over converses. Winning in
<em>bi&agrave;n</em> is fitting the thing.</p>

<p>
Explanation: One calls it &ldquo;ox&rdquo;, the other calls it
&ldquo;non-ox&rdquo;. This is contending over converses. These do not
jointly fit the object. If they do not jointly fit, it must be that
one does not fit.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
While this may seem like an idle discussion, Chinese thinkers took the
rectification of names to be of paramount importance. If speakers do
not use names and terms uniformly, chaos and anarchy will ensue. In
particular, they will not be able to follow commands as intended by
their superiors, as these thinkers emphasized the action-guiding over
the descriptive functions of language (see entry on the
 <a href="../school-names/disputation.html">School of Names, supplement &ldquo;Disputation in context&rdquo;</a>).</p>
 
<p>
While intellectuals of all main traditions in the classical period
discussed (and presumably engaged in) <em>bi&agrave;n</em>, there are
three main (interrelated) accounts of argumentation in classical
Chinese thought: that of the early Mohists in their rebuttal of
fatalism, that of the later Mohist dialectic, and that of
X&uacute;nz&#464; (a prominent thinker in the Confucian tradition;
Fraser 2013). And yet, while they contain sophisticated analyses of
proper and improper uses of language in disputations, they remain
fundamentally different from the theories of argumentation found in
Aristotle&rsquo;s texts, for example, in particular in that there is
no explicit articulation of inferential rules and
principles&mdash;even if implicitly they seem to endorse certain
principles, such as the principle of non-contradiction when stating
that something cannot both be called &ldquo;ox&rdquo; and
&ldquo;non-ox&rdquo; (see passage quoted above). The key concept in
the Chinese context is that of analogy: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
inference is thus understood as the act of distinguishing something as
a certain kind of thing on the basis of having distinguished it as
similar to a relevant &ldquo;model&rdquo; or &ldquo;standard&rdquo;.
(Fraser 2013: 4)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As noted above, analogical reasoning is also widely present in the
Greek tradition, but in the latter it coexists with other modes of
reasoning, including deductive reasoning. In this respect, we may say
that the property of necessary truth-preservation did not stand out
for the Chinese thinkers, who were primarily concerned with
language-world relations rather than with relations between sentences
(as part of a more general pragmatic intellectual orientation). So
here again we have an argumentative tradition tailored to the needs of
its practitioners in their own sociocultural circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="MediTrad">2. Medieval Traditions</h3>

<h4 id="Lati">2.1 Latin</h4>

<p>
The Latin medieval intellectual tradition is commonly thought to span
from Boethius in the sixth century up to the fifteenth century and
beyond. The common denominators were the use of Latin as lingua franca
and its (institutional as well as intellectual) proximity with
Christianity. A focus on debating and argumentation is a crucial
feature of this tradition, in particular as crystalized in what is
known as <em>scholastic disputation</em>. Scholastic disputation is a
formalized, rigorous procedure for debate, based on fairly strict
rules, which became one of the main approaches for intellectual
inquiry in medieval Europe (Novikoff 2013). Inspired by ancient Greek
argumentation methods, it was then further developed in the
monasteries of the early Middle Ages. It reached its pinnacle from the
twelfth century onwards, especially with the birth and growth of
universities, where it became one of the main teaching methods (see
entry on
 <a href="../medieval-literary/index.html">literary forms of medieval philosophy</a>).
 The influence of disputations went well beyond universities,
expanding towards multiple spheres of cultural life.</p>

<p>
Schematically, such disputations may be described thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[A disputation] is a regular form of teaching, apprenticeship and
research, presided over by a master, characterized by a dialectical
method which consists of bringing forward and examining arguments
based on reason and authority which oppose one another on a given
theoretical or practical problem and which are furnished by
participants, and where the master must come to a doctrinal solution
by an act of determination which confirms him in his function as
master. (Baz&aacute;n, Wippel, Fransen, &amp; Jacquart 1985: 40; as
quoted in the entry on
 <a href="../medieval-literary/index.html">literary forms of medieval philosophy</a>)</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
In other words, a disputation starts with a statement, and then goes
on to examine arguments in favor and against the statement. A
disputation is essentially a dialogical practice in that it features
two (possibly fictive) parties disagreeing on a given statement and
producing arguments to defend their respective positions, even if both
roles can be played by one and the same person. The goal may simply be
that of convincing an interlocutor and/or the audience, but the
implication is typically that something deeper is achieved, namely
coming closer to the truth by examining the question from many
different angles (Angelelli 1970).</p>

<p>
Medieval intellectuals engaged in &ldquo;live&rdquo; disputations,
both privately, between a master and a pupil, and as grand public
events attended by the university community at large (Novikoff 2013).
Moreover, the general structure is used extensively in some of the
most prominent writings by these authors (some of them are in fact
written-up versions of disputations actually having taken place, known
as <em>reportatio</em>). For example, Aquinas&rsquo; <em>Summa
Theologica</em>&mdash;possibly the most influential work from the
scholastic tradition&mdash;follows the structure of a disputation,
with arguments for and against specific claims being examined (see
entry on
 <a href="../aquinas/index.html">Thomas Aquinas</a>).
 Indeed, disputation became one of the chief methods for intellectual
inquiry in general, and medieval treatises on philosophical topics
typically contain a fair amount of disputational vocabulary. The
widespread presence of disputation and related genres has been
described as &ldquo;the institutionalization of conflict&rdquo; in
scholasticism (see entry on
 <a href="../medieval-literary/index.html">literary forms of medieval philosophy</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Logical textbooks were expected to provide the required training to
excel in the art of disputation, with chapters on fallacies,
consequence, the logical structure and meaning of propositions,
<em>obligationes</em> (a special kind of disputation) etc., all of
which are directly relevant for the art of disputation (see entries on
medieval theories of
 <a href="../consequence-medieval/index.html">consequence</a>,
 <a href="../medieval-terms/index.html">properties of terms</a>, and
 <a href="../obligationes/index.html"><em>obligationes</em></a>).
 In fact, to a great extent Latin medieval authors did not
differentiate between &ldquo;<em>logica</em>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<em>dialectica</em>&rdquo;, as attested by the fact that a
number of influential logical textbooks&mdash;Abelard&rsquo;s <em>De
Dialectica</em>, Buridan&rsquo;s <em>Summulae de
dialectica</em>&mdash;bore the term &ldquo;<em>dialectica</em>&rdquo;
in their titles. As late as in the sixteenth century, the Spanish
scholastic author Domingo de Soto still defined dialectic/logic as
&ldquo;the art or science of disputing&rdquo; (Ashworth 2011).</p>

<p>
But elsewhere, Renaissance authors such as Lorenzo Valla (Nauta 2009;
see entry on
 <a href="../lorenzo-valla/index.html">Lorenzo Valla</a>)
 were harsh critics of the genre of scholastic disputation. These
authors deplored the lack of applicability of scholastic logic; Valla
for example saw syllogisms as an artificial type of reasoning, useless
for orators on account of being too far removed from natural ways of
speaking and arguing. They condemned the cumbersome, artificial and
overly technical Latin of scholastic authors, and defended a return to
the classical Latin of Cicero and Vergil. Many Renaissance authors did
not belong to the university system, where scholasticism was still the
norm in the fifteenth century; instead, many were civil servants, and
were thus involved in politics, administration, and civic life in
general. As such, they were much more interested in rhetoric and
persuasion than in logic and demonstration (Dutilh Novaes 2017).</p>

<p>
The demise of scholasticism was a gradual process, and for centuries
the logic taught at universities was still based on general
Aristotelian theories such as syllogistic. But as a whole, logic and
argumentation became less prominent topics of discussion for thinkers
in the early modern period (Dutilh Novaes 2020: ch. 7). One exception
is the so-called <em>Port Royal Logic</em> (1662), which presented
itself explicitly as a manual on the art of thinking, but which
contains extensive discussions on modes of arguing as well (see entry
on
 <a href="../port-royal-logic/index.html">Port Royal logic</a>).</p>
 
<h4 id="Isla">2.2 Islamicate</h4>

<p>
With the advent of Islam in the seventh century, a new cultural and
intellectual tradition was initiated; alongside the novelty of Islam,
it drew significantly from earlier sources such as ancient Greek
philosophy and also Persian and Arabic sources (among others). (The
term &ldquo;Islamicate&rdquo; is used to refer to what pertains to
regions in which Muslims are culturally dominant, but not specifically
to the religion of Islam as such.) The primary language of learning in
this tradition was Arabic, but significant texts were also written in
Persian, Turkish and Hebrew (among other languages).</p>

<p>
In this tradition, the term <em>jadal</em> was generally used to refer
to argumentative practices and accompanying theories; it is commonly
translated as &ldquo;dialectic&rdquo; or &ldquo;disputation
theory&rdquo; (Young 2017; Miller 2020). Islamicate theories of
argumentation come in many kinds, emerging within specific fields of
inquiry such as theology and later jurisprudence, but also as
domain-independent reflections on how to reason and argue well, in
particular but not exclusively in connection with logic and ancient
Greek sources such as Aristotle (see entry on
 <a href="../arabic-islamic-language/index.html">Arabic and Islamic philosophy of language and logic</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The advent of the Abbasid Caliphate (750&ndash;1258) marked the
beginning of systematic efforts to translate a wide range of ancient
Greek texts, in particular texts by Aristotle and his commentators,
under the protection and sponsorship of these rulers. The translation
movement culminated around 830 in the circle of al-Kind&icirc; in
Baghdad, and inaugurated the intellectual tradition of
<em>falsafa</em> (an alliteration for the Greek word
&ldquo;<em>philosophia</em>&rdquo;), which, at least initially, was
viewed as a competitor for the &ldquo;local&rdquo; traditions of
<em>kalam</em> (rational theology) and <em>fiqh</em> (Islamic
jurisprudence) (Miller 2020; see entries on
 <a href="../arabic-islamic-greek/index.html">Greek sources in Arabic and Islamic philosophy</a>
 and on
 <a href="../arabic-islamic-natural/index.html">Arabic and Islamic natural philosophy and natural science</a>).
 The latter also offered accounts of reasoning and argumentation (in
their specific domains), but until the eleventh century there was
little cross-pollination between them and Greek-inspired logic and
philosophy.</p>

<p>
The earliest fully-fledged theories of <em>jadal</em> emerged in
theological contexts, around the turn of the ninth to the tenth
century (Miller 2020: ch. 2). For these theologians, <em>jadal</em> is
a method for attaining truth, used by God in disputing with the Jews,
and taught by God to his prophet. The focus is thus predominantly
epistemological, but <em>jadal</em> is said to explicitly involve at
least two people (thus being different from solitary speculation) who
exchange questions and answers. The ultimate goal is to defend and
prove the truth of Islam in contexts of religious disputes. The
authors in this tradition wrote detailed treatises that included
discussions of rules of conduct during debates, objections and
counter-objections, and signs of defeat. The theological tradition of
<em>jadal</em> then provided the substratum for the development of
dialectical theories of jurisprudence (Miller 2020: ch. 4).</p>

<p>
Within <em>falsafa</em>, argumentation was initially studied from the
perspective of the Aristotelian <em>Organon</em>. By the early tenth
century, a group of self-declared Peripatetics in Baghdad presented
themselves as the defenders of Aristotelian orthodoxy. The most famous
member of this group was al-Farabi, who composed a series of
commentaries on the books of the <em>Organon</em>, including an
influential commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Topics</em>, which was
known as the <em>Book of Dialectic</em> (<em>Kit&#257;b al-Jadal</em>;
(DiPasquale 2019; see entries on
 <a href="../al-farabi/index.html">al-Farabi</a>
 and
 <a href="../al-farabi-logic/index.html">al-Farabi&rsquo;s philosophy of logic and language</a>).
 At this stage, unsurprisingly, these thinkers were predominantly
interested in the key topics of Aristotle&rsquo;s logical canon such
as syllogistic, dialectic, and demonstration, and developed detailed
theories on argumentation (Miller 2020: ch. 3).</p>

<p>
All this was to change thanks to the larger-than-life figure of Ibn
Sina (Avicenna; ca. 970&ndash;1037; see entry on
 <a href="../ibn-sina/index.html">Ibn Sina</a>).
 Ibn Sina reoriented the Aristotelian conception of logic as closely
connected with dialectic and argumentation towards a more
epistemological, mentalistic approach (see entry on
 <a href="../ibn-sina-logic/index.html">Ibn Sina&rsquo;s logic</a>).
 Ibn Sina went on to become the most influential thinker in the
Islamicate tradition in subsequent centuries, and this meant that the
study of logic, referred to as <em>mantiq</em>, became by and large
divorced from <em>jadal</em>.</p>

<p>
In later periods, the &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; theories of the
<em>falsafa</em> tradition were finally (partially) incorporated into
the original traditions in jurisprudence, law and theology, in
particular with the rise of the madrasa system starting in the late
eleventh century (El-Rouayheb 2016; madrasas were official
institutions of learning, functionally similar to European
universities). In the madrasas, the Arabic scholastic method became
consolidated and widely disseminated (see entry on
 <a href="../arabic-islamic-language/index.html">Arabic and Islamic philosophy of language and logic</a>).
 But theories of disputation tended to be studied as an independent
discipline, called &ldquo;the science of disputation&rdquo; (<em>'ilm
al-munazara</em>) or &ldquo;the rules of discussion&rdquo;
(<em>&#257;d&#257;b al-ba&#7717;th</em>), whereas logic
(<em>mantiq</em>) remained focused on epistemological concerns. As
described by Miller (2020: 103), </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>&#257;d&#257;b al-ba&#7717;th</em> emerged as an independent
intellectual discipline and literary genre by adopting concepts from
Aristotelian logic and philosophy as well as rules formulated in the
context of both juridical and theological dialectics. (The earliest
works in the <em>&#257;d&#257;b al-ba&#7717;th</em> tradition date to
the first half of the 14<sup>th</sup> century) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, over the centuries, authors and thinkers in the Islamic World
produced sophisticated theories of argumentation, and this from
different angles, in particular theology, law, and philosophy.</p>

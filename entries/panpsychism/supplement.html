<h2>Possible Solutions to the Subject-Summing Problem</h2>

<h3>Non-Constitutive Forms of Panpsychism</h3>

<p>
What seems difficult to make sense of in the subject-summing problem
is certain conscious subjects coming together to constitute a new
subject. Constitutive panpsychists need to make sense of this, as they
hold that facts about human and animal subjects are constituted of
facts about more fundamental kinds of subject. However, according to
non-constitutive panpsychism, human and animal subjects are
fundamental, and hence there is no obvious need to make sense of a
constitution relation holding between distinct subjects. Thus, it is
much less obvious that non-constitutive panpsychists are threatened by
the subject-summing problem.</p>

<p>
There may nonetheless be some troubles (for the non-constitutive
panpsychist) pertaining to subject combination, depending on the
details of the view. The emergentist panpsychist who is happy to
explain the emergence of biological subjects from micro-level subjects
in terms of brute contingent laws of nature will thereby avoid the
pressure to make sense of an intelligible connection between the
emergent biological mind and that from which it
 emerges.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup>
 However, an emergentist panpsychist who thinks that causation is an
intelligible process will need to make sense of the intelligible
emergence of biological subjects, something that is threatened by
Goff&rsquo;s conceivability argument against mental combination
(considered in the discussion of the subject-summing problem). Patrick
Lewtas (2017) has developed an elaborate form of layered emergentism
in which there are allegedly no intelligibility gaps. Hedda Hassel
M&oslash;rch (2014, 2018) has developed a form of fusionism according
to which the emergence of biological subjects from micro-subjects is
partially intelligible.</p>

<p>
Even if resistant to the subject-summing problem, non-constitutive
forms of panpsychism may suffer from other forms of the combination
problem, some of which are discussed in the main body of this
entry.</p>

<h3>The Ignorance Response</h3>

<p>
Galen Strawson (2006b: section 16) responds to the subject-summing
problem by suggesting that there could be some aspect of the nature of
consciousness we don&rsquo;t have a grip on, but which is essential
for understanding subject combination. This response might be spelt
out in two ways. It could be that there is something about the
property of consciousness itself we don&rsquo;t understand.
Alternately (Goff 2017), it could be that consciousness is part of a
more expansive property, &ldquo;consciousness+&rdquo;, of which
consciousness is one aspect. (It is pleasant to reflect on how
beautiful such a property would be, enfolding experiential and
non-experiential aspects into a single unified nature).</p>

<p>
It could be held that this ignorance is temporary; theorising our way
to this hidden factor could be seen as a crucial goal for future
enquiry. Or it could be that humans are just constitutively incapable
of ever coming to an understanding of the missing facts, just as dogs
do not have the kind of brains that would allow them to do
mathematics. This latter form of the ignorance response can be seen as
a kind of hybrid of panpsychism and mysterianism (discussed in the
<em>Panpsychism Versus Panprotopsychism</em> section).</p>

<p>
One difficulty with this response (Goff 2009, 2017: ch. 7) is it
threatens to undermine at least one motivation for panpsychism. If we
need to invest in hidden properties in order to explain macro-level
consciousness, why not suppose that those hidden properties do all the
work? After all, <em>ex hypothesi</em> we don&rsquo;t really
understand how the hidden properties contribute to grounding
consciousness, and this ignorance would seem to remove any grounds for
thinking that the hidden properties are only able to ground
macro-level consciousness by combining with micro-level consciousness.
Thus, we arguably lose our motivation for postulating
micro-consciousness. If we need to postulate hidden properties anyway,
and they could do all the work, why
 bother?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-s27">27</a>]</sup>
 It is important to note that this does not remove other motivations
for panpsychism, such as the intrinsic nature argument (discussed in
the main body of this entry).</p>

<h3>Phenomenal Bonding</h3>

<p>
In virtue of what do certain entities compose another entity? It is
natural to think that relations have at least something to do with it.
Bricks can&rsquo;t compose a house unless they are stuck together;
organs can&rsquo;t compose a body unless they work together in
sustaining the organism. Thus, one might suppose that there is some
special relationship that obtains between certain micro-level
conscious subjects, in virtue of which they constitute a macro-level
conscious subject. Goff (2009, 2016) dubbed such a relationship
&ldquo;phenomenal bonding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Turning this into an adequate response to the subject-summing problem
would seem to require cashing out the exact nature of this
relationship. Conceiving of micro-level conscious subjects standing in
physical relationships to each other, e.g., spatial or functional
relationships, does not seem to close the conceivability gap between
subjects at the micro-level and subjects at the macro-level; this is
evidenced by the apparent conceivability of micro-experiential zombies
(see Goff&rsquo;s conceivability argument against mental combination,
considered in the discussion of the subject-summing problem). What
other relations are there that micro-subjects bear to each other?</p>

<p>
One option is to hold that we have no positive conception of the
phenomenal bonding relation, and that this accounts for our inability
to understand phenomenal bonding. This would make the phenomenal
bonding solution a form of the ignorance response outlined above;
it&rsquo;s just that what we are ignorant of is not some aspect of
consciousness itself, but a relationship which conscious subjects bear
to each other. This may lead to a worry similar to that outlined in
the last section: if we have no positive grip on the nature of the
relationship that bonds things together to produce macro-level
subjects, why not suppose that that relationship bonds together
non-conscious things (to make a conscious thing) rather than conscious
things (to make a conscious thing)? This would dispense with the need
to postulate micro-level consciousness. On the other hand (Goff 2016,
2017: ch. 7), if our aim is to characterise the intrinsic nature of
matter (see the discussion of the intrinsic nature argument), then
this view is arguably superior to out and out mysterianism, in that it
does at least provide us with a positive conception of the
non-relational properties of material entities.</p>

<p>
Barry Dainton (2011) and Gregory Miller (2017) propose
co-consciousness as the phenomenal bonding relation: the relation that
holds between two experiences when they are <em>experienced
together</em>. An advantage of this view, according to Dainton and
Miller, is that this is a relation we are aware of in introspection:
when we introspect, it is apparent that each of our experiences is
co-conscious with all of the others. It is perhaps more natural to
suppose that this fact is grounded in the fact that each of my
experiences belongs to the same subject. But it is not obviously
incoherent to suppose that the priority goes the other way round: my
experiences belong to a single unified subject because they are
co-conscious with each other. Perhaps then micro-level experiences
compose a macro-level subject when they come to bear the
co-consciousness relation to each other.</p>

<h3>Sharing Experiences</h3>

<p>
Suppose I have an office chair that weighs 40 pounds. Let&rsquo;s
imagine the base weighs 20 pounds and the seat weighs 20 pounds. Now,
if the chair weights 40 pounds, the base 20 pounds, and the seat 20
pounds, then does that mean the whole composite entity weighs 80
pounds (weight of chair + weights of base + weight of seat)? Of course
not! The 20 pound mass belonging to the base also belongs to the chair
as a whole, as does the mass belonging to the seat; the mass of the
chair as a whole <em>just is</em> the mass of the base and the mass of
the seat. At least, this is how we ordinarily conceive of things. If
this all makes sense regarding mass, maybe the same is true of
experiences. Suppose my brain has experiences and the parts of my
brain have experiences. Maybe we don&rsquo;t need to suppose that my
experiences are distinct from the experience of my brain&rsquo;s
parts. Perhaps instead my experiences <em>just are</em> the
experiences of my brain&rsquo;s parts, in the same way that the mass
of my office chair just is the mass of its parts. </p>

<p>
It is normally assumed that anything that has experiences is a subject
(NB this will be questioned below). Granting this, if my brain shares
the experiences of its parts, it follows that my brain must be a
subject. Luke Roelofs (2015, 2016, 2019, 2020) and Philip Goff
(Roelofs and Goff forthcoming) have explored this as a strategy for
solving the subject-summing problem. </p>

<p>
Some might think this merely pushes the lump to another part of the
carpet, as we now have to explain how my brain gets to share the
experiences of its parts. Roelofs has suggested it might true about
<em>composition in</em> <em>general </em>that properties of parts are
&lsquo;inherited&rsquo; by wholes, at least for certain key properties
of physical objects. Totally independently of panpsychism, some
philosophers have pressed that the composition relation is similar to
the identity relation, which may go some way to explaining why
properties are shared between wholes and parts. Adopting this strategy
could potentially make it an a priori truth that my brain shares
experiences with its parts (if its parts have experiences), thus
rendering micro-experiential zombies incoherent. Having said that, one
person&rsquo;s modus ponens is another&rsquo;s modus tollens, and many
will start from the conceivability of micro-experience zombies and
infer the falsity of the above general claim about composition.</p>

<p>
Another option is to combine experience sharing with emergentism. This
might involve conceding the possibility of a micro-experiential zombie
world, while holding that in the actual world a basic law of nature
ensures that properties of parts are inherited by wholes. We noted in
the main discussion of emergentism that one common objection is that
neuroscience and cellular biology (allegedly) show no sign of the
existence of distinctive causal powers associated with biological
consciousness. But on the form of emergentism currently under
consideration, this may not be a problem, as on this view biological
forms of consciousness are nothing over and above consciousness at the
level of basic physics.</p>

<h3>Cosmopsychism </h3>

<p>
Constitutive cosmopsychists (discussed in the main body of this entry)
hold that facts about human and animal subjects are grounded in facts
about the conscious universe rather than in facts about micro-level
subjects; thus they avoid the need to make sense of subject-summing.
However, they arguably face an analogous problem, which Miri Albahari
(2020) calls &ldquo;the decombination problem&rdquo;: in virtue of
what do &ldquo;big&rdquo; conscious subjects (such as the universe)
ground &ldquo;little&rdquo; conscious subjects (such as us)? Just as
we can conceive of micro-level subjects existing in the absence of
macro-level subjects, so it seems that we can conceive of a conscious
universe existing without having conscious parts (i.e., without
anything <em>within</em> the universe being conscious). Thus, if we
think of the subject-summing problem as arising from the
conceivability gap between more fundamental and less-fundamental
conscious subjects (see Goff&rsquo;s conceivability argument against
mental combination considered in the discussion of the subject-summing
problem), then constitutive cosmopsychism faces essentially the same
problem.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, cosmopsychists have argued that there are various
respects in which cosmopsychism eases the problem. As discussed in the
main body of this entry, Nagasawa &amp; Wager (2016) suggest that
cosmopsychism can help to address the grain problem (Miller 2021 is a
response). And Goff (2017: ch. 9, forthcoming) argues that in the
framework of constitutive cosmopsychism there is no need to suppose
that less fundamental properties admit of reductive analysis, and that
this removes the necessity of providing a reductive analysis of human
and animal consciousness. Itay Shani presents his defence of
cosmopsychism against the backdrop of Coleman&rsquo;s version of the
subject-summing problem (discussed in the main document of this
entry). Shani concedes that Coleman demonstrates that the existence of
one subject cannot be wholly grounded in facts about another.
Nonetheless, he sketches in broad brushstrokes an intelligible
explanation of each organic subject&rsquo;s capacity for experience,
and its having of a perspective, in terms of the experiential
capacities and the perspectivality of the universe. Shani hopes that
such partial grounding of non-cosmic subjects allows us to avoid the
kind of radical emergence Strawson worries about in his
anti-emergentist argument (the latter is discussed in the main body of
this entry). </p>

<p>
Gregory Miller (2017) has explored whether it is coherent for
cosmopsychists to hold that some subjects are proper parts of other
subjects, proposing that a distinction between absolute and relative
phenomenal unity may help.</p>

<h3>Getting Rid of Subjects</h3>

<p>
Annaka Harris (2021) has argued that we can avoid the subject-summing
problem by dropping a commitment to subjects. According to Harris, all
that really exists is consciousness and its contents. Philip Goff
(2021) responds that the basic problem may still arise if the contents
of consciousness at the macro-level cannot be reduced to contents of
consciousness at the micro-level. Relatedly, Luke Roelofs (2017) has
defended the possibility of this kind of &lsquo;selfless agent&rsquo;,
i.e. a rational agent constituted of a group of agents none of whom
can know the group as &lsquo;I&rsquo;.</p>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 These are all issues which F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; in <em>On the
Aims of the Metaphysics</em> says (rather tendentiously) that
Aristotle treats in <em>Metaphysics</em> XII (see further in 
  <a href="index-2.html#FaraMetaScieArisMeta">Section 2</a>), 
and which F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; himself treats in accord with
his interpretation of Aristotelian metaphysics in the <em>Perfect
City</em> and <em>Political Regime</em> (see
 <a href="index-2.html#FrbsPhilTheoPerfCityPoliRegi">Section 4</a>).
 But F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; thinks that the scientific resolution of
these issues depends on a technical substructure discussing less
immediately appealing issues, including the logical syntax of being
and unity (see
 <a href="index-2.html#FrbsOntoBookLettOneUnit">Section 3</a>).</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 He says &ldquo;<em>&#703;ilm al-taw&#7717;&icirc;d</em>&rdquo;,
literally &ldquo;science of unification&rdquo;, i.e., the knowledge
that there is only one God: this is a standard way of referring to
<em>kal&acirc;m</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 This is the twelfth book on our count, but F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;
lists it as the eleventh rather than twelfth because the translation
of the <em>Metaphysics</em> available to him is missing Book I, as it
is also missing the last book, XIV: see Bertolacci 2005.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 In Greek it is usually a phrase, &ldquo;<em>ta meta ta
phusika</em>&rdquo; = &ldquo;what is after physics&rdquo;, only rarely
contracted into &ldquo;<em>ta metaphusika</em>&rdquo;. The neuter
plural definite article &ldquo;<em>ta</em>&rdquo; is standard in Greek
for referring to a treatise, but strange in referring to a discipline,
and seems to show that the phrase started as a name for a text and was
transferred from the text to the science it contains.
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; says &ldquo;<em>m&acirc; ba&#703;d
al-tab&icirc;&#703;a</em>&rdquo;, a calque of the Greek phrase.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 &ldquo;<em>Sophia</em>&rdquo; means theoretical wisdom, i.e.,
whatever kind of knowledge is most intrinsically valuable, setting
aside considerations of practical usefulness;
&ldquo;<em>phron&ecirc;sis</em>&rdquo; is practical wisdom, the
ability to deliberate well, so as to guide practical action.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 There is a controversy (see note 11) about whether Aristotle means by
&ldquo;separate&rdquo; here &ldquo;separate from matter&rdquo; or
&ldquo;existing separately, i.e., as a substance, not as an attribute
of some other underlying substance&rdquo;, but he certainly thinks
both of these are true of the objects in question. Aristotle describes
first philosophy as &ldquo;theology&rdquo; at <em>Metaphysics</em>
VI,1 1026a16&ndash;22, and at <em>Metaphysics</em> I,2 983a5&ndash;10
says that wisdom is a &ldquo;divine science&rdquo; in two ways, both
because god is among the causes and principles it studies, and because
it is the kind of science that a god would have. See D&eacute;carie
1961 for a survey of all the passages where Aristotle gives one or
another description of wisdom or first philosophy.</p>
</div>

 Or <em>Metaphysics</em> XIII, since <em>Metaphysics</em> XIV was
apparently not available to F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;: see Bertolacci
2005.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 For Porphyry on this, see Simplicius&rsquo; <em>Commentary on
Aristotle&rsquo;s Physics</em> (<em>Commentaria in Aristotelem
Graeca</em> 9) 9,10&ndash;22: this would have come from
Porphyry&rsquo;s commentary on the first sentence of the
<em>Physics</em>. Asclepius&rsquo; <em>Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s
Metaphysics</em> (<em>Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca</em> 6.2)
2,16&ndash;20 says that metaphysics demonstrates the principles of all
the sciences.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; also discusses &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;
[<em>&#7717;ikma</em>] in the <em>Attainment of Happiness</em>, and
&ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo; (and clearly equivalent expressions) in the
<em>Philosophy of Aristotle</em>. In the <em>Attainment of
Happiness</em>, and in some of the texts in the <em>Philosophy of
Aristotle</em>, F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s main points seem to
be that wisdom is a theoretical knowledge which is constitutive of the
highest aim for human beings, that the true statesman needs this
knowledge, that it is the highest architectonic knowledge (i.e., that
it uses the other kinds of knowledge, or is the knowledge of how to
use the other kinds of knowledge, so that we will use them well only
if we also have wisdom), or sometimes that prudence makes use of other
things (including other kinds of knowledge) in order to secure our
acquisition of wisdom and thus our attainment of our goal. In these
texts F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; seems to be following Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> VI and perhaps Plato&rsquo;s
<em>Statesman</em> (known through Galen&rsquo;s synopsis), and perhaps
connecting them with things Aristotle says about wisdom in
<em>Metaphysics</em> I,1&ndash;2, to whatever extent he may have been
aware of that text. None of this tells us what wisdom is a science of.
<em>Philosophy of Aristotle</em> #99 speaks of Aristotle beginning
from bodies and souls and discovering, as their highest causes, the
separate agent intelligence and the mover or movers of the eternal
rotations of the heavens. Physics or psychology can perhaps grasp that
the agent intelligence and the movers of the heavens exist and are
causes to the soul or to the heavens, but only metaphysics can grasp
what the agent intelligence or the movers of the heavens are in
themselves. F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s description of
metaphysics here is purely &ldquo;theological&rdquo;, concerned with
first causes existing separately from matter and motion; he says
nothing in the <em>Philosophy of Aristotle</em> about a science of
being qu&acirc; being. He does however say in <em>Philosophy of
Aristotle</em> #99 (without giving a justification) that these things
do not fall under any of the Aristotelian categories, which connects
with what he says in the <em>Book of Letters</em> about the objects of
metaphysics: see discussion of the <em>Book of Letters</em> in
 <a href="index-2.html#FrbsOntoBookLettOneUnit">Section 3</a>
 below.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 There is an English translation of <em>On the Aims</em> in
McGinnis-Reisman 2007 (78&ndash;81), and another in Bertolacci 2006b
(66&ndash;72).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 The text of this passage is controversial, with the majority of
modern scholars thinking that Aristotle really wrote &ldquo;physics is
about things that are separate but not unmoved&rdquo;
(&ldquo;separate&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;existing as substances, not as
attributes of some other underlying substance&rdquo;). But
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;, with the Greek commentators and with the
Arabic translations (and indeed with all known Greek manuscripts),
took Aristotle to have said &ldquo;physics is about things that are
inseparate but not unmoved&rdquo; (&ldquo;inseparate&rdquo; meaning
&ldquo;inseparate from matter&rdquo;). Aristotle says that &ldquo;some
of mathematics&rdquo; is about unmoved things because he counts
astronomy, which is about moved things, as part of mathematics.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 In all this F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; is following Aristotle
<em>Metaphysics</em> IV,2, 1003b19&ndash;1004a31.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Avicenna, following and developing what F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; says
here, says that being is the subject [Arabic
<em>maw&#7693;&ucirc;&#703;</em> = Greek <em>hupokeimenon</em>] of
metaphysics, i.e., the subject-genus whose attributes and causes it
investigates, but the God is the object [Arabic
<em>ma&#7789;l&ucirc;b</em> = Greek <em>z&ecirc;toumenon</em>] of
metaphysics, i.e., the ultimate cause which the science aims at
discovering. For a full discussion and comparison of Avicenna with
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; as well as with the Greek background, see
Bertolacci 2006a.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 There are Croatian and Turkish translations of the <em>Book of
Letters</em> (Bu&#269;an 1999 and T&uuml;rker 2008), and a translation
of the second part (not on metaphysics) in Khalidi 2005. There are
English translations of the <em>Book of Letters</em> and <em>On the
One and Unity</em> in progress or in draft.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 But on <em>On the One and Unity</em> see Janos 2016. There is a PhD
dissertation in progress on <em>On the One and Unity</em> by Hakan
Genc (McGill University). Much of the discussion here of the <em>Book
of Letters</em> follows Menn 2008; see also Druart 2007 and Diebler
2005, and the discussions in Abed 1991 and in the long and thorough
introduction to Zimmermann 1981. On Averroes&rsquo; reception of the
<em>Book of Letters</em> and <em>On the One and Unity</em>, see Menn
2011.</p>

<div id="note-16">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 &ldquo;Particle&rdquo; must thus be understood, in Arabic grammar, in
a somewhat broader sense than is standard, e.g., in Greek grammar.
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; gives an elaborate classification of
particles in his <em>Kit&acirc;b al-alf&acirc;&#7827;
al-musta&#8219;mala f&icirc; l-man&#7789;iq</em> (Mahdi 1968,
42&ndash;56). In Arabic all such words are short, sometimes a single
letter. Likewise, &ldquo;noun&rdquo; must be taken broadly to include
adjectives.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; discusses the appearances created by the
grammatical form of paronymous expressions, and instances in which
they may mislead, notably in <em>Book of Letters</em> I,20&ndash;21,
I,26, I,36 and I,84. Aristotle discusses sophisms of <em>skh&ecirc;ma
t&ecirc;s lexe&ocirc;s</em> in <em>On Sophistical Refutations</em> 4,
166b10&ndash;19, and at length in <em>On Sophistical Refutations</em>
22. Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em> 5 3b10&ndash;23 discusses
the misleading grammatical appearance that a secondary substance-term
like &ldquo;human&rdquo; signifies a this, as its <em>skh&ecirc;ma
t&ecirc;s pros&ecirc;gorias</em> (= <em>skh&ecirc;ma t&ecirc;s
lexe&ocirc;s</em>) would suggest.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 The fragmentarily transmitted beginning of <em>Book of Letters</em>
Part I says that the words &ldquo;<em>un</em>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<em>&ucirc;n</em>&rdquo; in Greek were particles of
affirmation, comparable to &ldquo;<em>inna</em>&rdquo; in Arabic (thus
something like a Fregean assertion-stroke), with
&ldquo;<em>&ucirc;n</em>&rdquo; more strongly emphatic, and that the
Greeks use &ldquo;<em>&ucirc;n</em>&rdquo; to signify God by contrast
with all other beings, which they call &ldquo;<em>un</em>&rdquo;.
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; may be thinking of the difference between
Greek <em>on</em> and <em>&ocirc;n</em>, respectively neuter and
masculine nominative singular of the present participle of the verb
&ldquo;to be&rdquo; (Arabic does not have an &ldquo;o&rdquo;, and
these would be written in Arabic is &ldquo;<em>un</em>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<em>&ucirc;n</em>&rdquo; respectively).
&ldquo;<em>&Ocirc;n</em>&rdquo; is indeed used in the Bible as a name
for God, notably at Exodus 3:14.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 E.g., &ldquo;out of&rdquo;, V,24, is a particle in both Greek and
Arabic; &ldquo;before&rdquo; and &ldquo;after&rdquo;, V,11, and
&ldquo;having&rdquo;, V,23, are particles in Arabic and
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; might have thought they would be particles in
Greek too; but, e.g., &ldquo;cause&rdquo;, V,2, and
&ldquo;substance&rdquo;, V,8, are not etymologically connected with
particles in Arabic, and there is no clear reason why
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; should think they would be in Greek either.
For details and more examples see Menn 2008.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Notably, the meanings of the noun &ldquo;principle&rdquo;
(<em>Metaphysics</em> V,1) track the meanings of the particle
&ldquo;whence&rdquo; or &ldquo;from which&rdquo;. For details and more
examples see Menn 2008.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 The Arabic translation of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>On
Interpretation</em> which F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; uses in his
commentary on that treatise explicitly calls the word for existence
(&ldquo;<em>wuj&ucirc;d</em>&rdquo; and the underlying word in Greek)
a particle at 20a3&ndash;5 and 21b5&ndash;7, and
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; takes that up in his commentary on those
passages of <em>On Interpretation</em> (Kutsch &amp; Marrow 1960,
128&ndash;9 and 165&ndash;7, English translation in Zimmermann 1981,
123&ndash;4 and 160&ndash;62).</p>

 At I,101&ndash;3 he comes back to give a discussion of being as a
copula.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 After a discussion of not-being in I,95&ndash;8, I,99 gives a
discussion of being <em>per se</em> (drawing on the earlier discussion
of &ldquo;<em>per se</em>&rdquo; and what is <em>per se</em> at
I,76&ndash;9), which mentions at the end that what is, but not <em>per
se</em>, is said to be <em>per accidens</em>. There was an earlier
discussion of &ldquo;<em>per accidens</em>&rdquo; and what is <em>per
accidens</em> at I,59&ndash;61, as part of a discussion of
accident.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">

 F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; says <em>ma&#703;q&ucirc;l&acirc;t</em>,
literally &ldquo;intelligibles&rdquo;, but he uses this consistently
for &ldquo;thoughts&rdquo;, calquing Greek <em>no&ecirc;mata</em>: it
has nothing to do with Platonic intelligible substances.</p>

 Like the <em>Republic</em>, and like F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s
description of the <em>Republic</em> in the <em>Philosophy of
Plato</em> (Rosenthal &amp; Walzer 1943, 19&ndash;20, #25; Mahdi
1969b, 5, #31&ndash;32) these texts include not only descriptions of
the best society ruled by philosophers and aiming at the perfection of
its members, but also classifications of the defective types of
society and how they arise. F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s list of
defective types of society is more complicated than Plato&rsquo;s, and
his description of the best society says nothing about the abolition
of the family and private property for the ruling and military groups,
or about the equality of men and women; he is not much interested in
constitutional details, much more in the values informing different
societies.</p>

 However, F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s description of the
<em>Republic</em> in his <em>Philosophy of Plato</em> does not mention
the account of the Forms in <em>Republic</em> V or the sun and cave
and line comparisons and the account of the rulers&rsquo; mathematical
and dialectical education in <em>Republic</em> VI&ndash;VII. But he
says that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
when this city had been rendered perfect in speech [sc. in the
<em>Republic</em>], he next presented in the <em>Timaeus</em> an
account of the divine and natural beings as they are perceived by the
intellect and known by means of that science; [he showed] what
distinguishes the sciences that ought to be set up in that city</p>

<p>
and so on (Mahdi&rsquo;s translation: <em>Philosophy of Plato</em>,
Rosenthal &amp; Walzer 1943, 20, #26; Mahdi 1969b, 65, #33). So it may
be more accurate to say that F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; saw the
<em>Perfect City</em> and <em>Political Regime</em> as his equivalents
not just to the <em>Republic</em> but to <em>Republic-Timaeus</em> or
even to <em>Republic-Timaeus-Laws-Critias-Epinomis</em> (described

 Although F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; might say that Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Metaphysics</em> XII,10 quickly sketches a downward way from God
to the things that derive from him, and that
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s work just fills in the details. But
certainly Plotinus, and especially Proclus in the <em>Elements of
Theology</em>, say far more about the downward way than
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; could have found in Aristotle, and
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; helps himself to some neo-Platonic devices
for explaining how a plurality can arise from a single principle, or
complex entities from simple entities, and for the basic idea that
bodies and souls are derived from an intelligence (Greek
<em>nous</em>, Arabic <em>&#703;aql</em>), or intelligences, superior
to souls, and these in turn from a God superior to intelligences. But
the details are different. F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s ontology
is much sparser, with far fewer incorporeal realities, and everything
is subordinated to the Aristotelian distinction between celestial and
sublunar domains.</p>

 Themistius&rsquo; paraphrase of <em>Metaphysics</em> XII is likely to
have been an important model, and a guide to F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;
in going beyond what Aristotle actually says in Book
XII&mdash;F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; mentions in <em>On the Aims of the
Metaphysics</em> that Themistius&rsquo; commentary on Book XII, and
Alexander&rsquo;s commentary on the first part of Book XII, were the
only commentaries on any part of the <em>Metaphysics</em> available in
Arabic. Themistius in his exposition of <em>Metaphysics</em> XII,10
develops Aristotle&rsquo;s comparisons of the cosmos with an army or a
household (with hierarchically ordered members), and adds a comparison
to the constitution of a city or a kingdom. While this part of
Themistius is extant only in a Hebrew translation of a lost Arabic
translation, Themistius uses a phrase for the constitution which may
well, in the Arabic, have been <em>siy&acirc;sa madan&icirc;ya</em>,
the title of F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s <em>Political
Regime</em>. Yoav Meyrav has now published an English translation of
Themistius&rsquo; paraphrase of <em>Metaphysics</em> XII (Meyrav
2020), using the Arabic where available and the Hebrew elsewhere,
which will make it much easier to compare Themistius&rsquo; and

 This list may be modelled on Proclus&rsquo; list of six kinds of
principle (the efficient, final and paradigmatic causes, and the
formal, material, and instrumental principles, which are not strictly
&ldquo;causes&rdquo;), which becomes standard among 5th&ndash;6th
century CE Platonists. For Proclus, each of these kinds of principle
has its highest representative at a different level in the hierarchy
of beings. While some details are similar between

 Plotinus also says &ldquo;the First&rdquo; in <em>Enneads</em> V,4,1,
&ldquo;How what is after the First is from the First, and on the
One&rdquo;, which seems to have been an important model for
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; for the beginning of the <em>Perfect
City</em>. The <em>Political Regime</em> usually says &ldquo;the
First&rdquo; (but at the first mention, in the first few lines of the
treatise, &ldquo;the first cause&rdquo;); but, just once, &ldquo;the
First is that about which one should judge that it is god&rdquo;
(Butterworth 2015, 29, #2). Here F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; says
<em>al-il&acirc;h</em>, &ldquo;the god&rdquo;, instead of the more
usual Muslim (and Jewish and Christian) <em>all&acirc;h</em>
(&ldquo;God&rdquo;), probably following a translation of Aristotle
(or, e.g., of Themistius&rsquo; paraphrase of <em>Metaphysics</em>
XII) which literally translated the Greek <em>ho theos</em>,
&ldquo;the god&rdquo;. But <em>al-il&acirc;h</em> is also perfectly
acceptable in Islam, and <em>all&acirc;h</em> is originally just a
contraction of <em>al-il&acirc;h</em>; there is no difference in
meaning.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-47">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-47">47.</a>
 F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;, following Aristotle, thinks that the
sensible world has existed from eternity, and that each species of
plant and animal in it has also existed from eternity, so in this
sense he allows infinite causal regresses, e.g., from me to my father
to his father and so back <em>ad infinitum</em>. Anyone who wants to
follow Aristotle consistently has to find a way to reconcile this with
<em>Metaphysics</em> II,2, where Aristotle says that there is no
infinite regress of any of the four kinds of cause. One standard thing
to say is that my father is not the cause of my <em>existence</em> but
only of my <em>coming-to-be</em>; this might be filled out by saying
that if he were a cause of my existence, then when he ceases to exist
I will also cease to exist. So perhaps when, in the <em>Perfect
City</em>, F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; speaks of <em>X</em> as a
&ldquo;cause of existence&rdquo; to <em>Y</em>, he means to restrict
this to cases where <em>X</em> exists at every moment when <em>Y</em>
exists (he clearly does not intend to restrict it to cases where
<em>X</em> and <em>Y</em> exist at precisely the same moments). If
there were an infinite regress of such &ldquo;causes of
existence&rdquo;, then the whole infinite series would have to exist
simultaneously, and F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; might be relying on the
Aristotelian principle of the impossibility of actual infinities in
rejecting this possibility. We might also say that if <em>X</em> is a
cause of existence to <em>Y</em> and <em>Y</em> is a cause of
existence to <em>Z</em>, then <em>Y</em> can only act to produce
<em>Z</em> if <em>X</em> is also cooperating in producing <em>Z</em>,
and that <em>X</em> is the primary cause of <em>Z</em>&rsquo;s
existence, and <em>Y</em> is only a secondary or instrumental cause;
and if so we might say that if there is an infinite regress of such
causes, there will be no sufficient cause for <em>Z</em>&rsquo;s
existence. Both of these arguments are developed by many medieval
philosophers.</p>

 I will use &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; for Arabic <em>&#703;aql</em> =
Greek <em>nous</em>: this Greek word and its Arabic equivalent can
mean many things, and F&acirc;r&acirc;bi wrote a whole treatise
working out a theory of the different things it can mean and how they
are related, translated as &ldquo;On the Intellect&rdquo; in
McGinnis-Reisman 2007 (68&ndash;78). The word &ldquo;Reason&rdquo;
(with a capital R) might be a better translation than
&ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;, but then it would be hard to translate the
cognate verb: I have translated the finite verb, awkwardly, as
&ldquo;intellectually cognize&rdquo; (we might say
&ldquo;intelligize&rdquo;) and the passive participle as
&ldquo;intelligible&rdquo;. The translation &ldquo;intellect&rdquo; is
misleading, since in many uses <em>&#703;aql</em> or <em>nous</em> is
not a kind of soul or a part of a soul or a power of a soul: sometimes
it is an act of a soul (a kind of cognition), or a disposition for
such an act (an intellectual virtue), and sometimes it is the kind of
separately existing substance, a Reason or Intelligence which acts on
souls or in which souls participate. Aristotle describes this last
kind of intelligence both in <em>On the Soul</em> III,5 and in
<em>Metaphysics</em> XII, at least as these texts are interpreted by
late ancient commentators. For F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; on
intelligence see the entry on

 Aristotle argues in <em>Metaphysics</em> XII,10 that two contrary
first principles (like Empedocles&rsquo; Love and Strife, or
Plato&rsquo;s One and Indefinite Dyad) could not act on each other,
but could only both act on a common matter, which would not be
contrary to either of them but would be in potentiality to both of
them. He then argues that the contrary principles would be dependent
on the matter for their actualization, and so would not be pure
actuality; he also argues that they would depend on some higher
principle that would determine when one thing can act on another.
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; discusses actuality and potentiality in
distinguishing an intelligence which is essentially actually cognizing
from an intelligence which is of itself potentially cognizing and
depends on something else for its actualization, but he says very
little about actuality and potentiality until he starts discussing
intelligence.</p>

 F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; is drawing on an interpretation of Aristotle
<em>On the Soul</em> III,4 430a6&ndash;7, which was taken in late
antiquity and the Middle Ages as saying that things that have matter
are only potentially intelligible. The implication would be that
things that exist without matter would be intelligible of themselves,
but that forms existing in matter would need to be separated or
&ldquo;abstracted&rdquo; from matter in order to become intelligible.
This interpretation would help to explain the role in intellectual
cognition of the &ldquo;active intelligence&rdquo; of <em>On the
Soul</em> III,5, which Aristotle&rsquo;s discussion leaves obscure:
the active intelligence would act on forms to abstract them from
matter in such a way that they could be received in a potential
intelligence, i.e., in a rational soul, and the soul&rsquo;s receiving
those forms would constitute its cognizing them. This interpretation
of <em>On the Soul</em> III,4&ndash;5 is now controversial. For

 Likewise the <em>Political Regime</em>: &ldquo;when the First exists
with the existence which belongs to it, it necessarily follows that
there exist from [the First] all the natural beings which do not
depend on human choice for the existence which they have&rdquo; (in
Butterworth 2015, 42, #27; Butterworth&rsquo;s translation is rather

 The words here translated by &ldquo;order&rdquo; and
&ldquo;rank&rdquo; are immediately cognate: the metaphor is of ranks
in an army arrayed for battle, and comes from Aristotle&rsquo;s
explicitly military metaphor of the &ldquo;order&rdquo; of the cosmos

 Thus the <em>Political Regime</em> distinguishes between the
intelligence governing each heavenly sphere, the soul of that sphere,
and the body of the sphere, where the <em>Perfect City</em> apparently
distinguishes only between the intelligence and the sphere, without
also positing a soul of the sphere.</p>

 At the end of <em>On the Intellect</em> (McGinnis-Reisman 2007,
77&ndash;78) F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; argues that because the
intelligence governing each heavenly sphere must produce two things,
it must be complex, and therefore cannot be the First, which must be
simple. His immediate aim here is to show that the First is not, as a
straightforward reading of Aristotle would suggest, the mover of the
outermost heaven, but rather something prior which produces the mover
of the outermost heaven. But if his argument here succeeds, it would
also show that, contrary to what the <em>Political Regime</em> would
suggest, the First cannot directly produce all of the intelligences
governing the heavenly spheres. This supports the suggestion that the
<em>Perfect City</em> is later than the <em>Political Regime</em>:
perhaps it was this argument, as given in <em>On the Intellect</em>,
that pushed him to work out the more complicated and indirect
emanation-scheme of the <em>Perfect City</em>. In any case <em>On the
Intellect</em> and the <em>Perfect City</em> seem to fit better with
each other than with the <em>Political Regime</em>.</p>

 F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; in <em>On the Appearance of Philosophy</em>
(preserved in a later historical compendium, Ibn ab&icirc;
U&#7779;aibi&#8219;a, and translated in Rosenthal 1975, 50&ndash;51),
keeps complete silence on all earlier Muslim philosophers, including
Kind&icirc; and Ab&ucirc; Bakr al-R&acirc;z&icirc;, representing
himself, a Muslim student of Christian teachers, as the person who
brought scientific philosophy into Islam. He is certainly aware of
Kind&icirc; and R&acirc;z&icirc;, but as far as currently appears he
never names R&acirc;z&icirc;, and names Kind&icirc; only once, in a
<em>musical</em> text, the <em>Kit&acirc;b
i&#7717;&#7779;&acirc;&#702; al-&icirc;q&acirc;&#8219;&acirc;t</em>,
which attacks Kind&icirc; for wrongly tracing certain rhythms in
Arabic music back to the Greek philosophers. There is a summary of the
treatise in Shiloah 1971; extracts were subsequently published in
Mahdi 1976. There was also earlier Muslim philosophy in Shi&#8219;ite,
and especially Isma&#8219;ili, circles. The Brethren of Purity are of
uncertain date, but Ibn al-Haitham (not the famous mathematical
scientist Ibn al-Haitham but the Fatimid propagandist whose memoir is
edited and translated by Madelung-Walker 1999) is certainly earlier
than F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;, and by his own account he was not the
first in this vein. The Isma&#8219;ilis want to give content to the
knowledge of the inner meaning of the Qur&#702;&acirc;n or of
religious law that their imam supposedly possesses, and often they
turn to (a popularized version of) Greek philosophy to fill in the
content. F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; too wants philosophy to supply this
inner meaning (which for him too is known by the im&acirc;m, though
certainly not only by the im&acirc;m), but he would regard the
Isma&#8219;ili versions of philosophy as unscientific, and he wants to
break philosophy out of Muslim sectarian confines as well as out of
Christian confines.</p>

 So F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s <em>On the Appearance of
Philosophy</em> (in Rosenthal 1975, 50&ndash;51).
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s account there of the history of Greek
and Arabic philosophy is a series of reworkings of myths, designed
ultimately to magnify his own position, and should never be taken on
faith, but sometimes there are real facts behind it, in however
distorted a form. The story about the bishops banning the study of
Aristotle&rsquo;s modal syllogistic and theory of demonstration
because it would endanger Christian faith is historically nonsense
(designed to tell a Muslim audience, &ldquo;show us by your tolerance
of logic that you don&rsquo;t have anything to be afraid of, as the
Christians do!&rdquo;), but Gutas 1999a has argued that it reflects a
decision in the Alexandrian <em>medical</em> schools to require the
teaching of Aristotle&rsquo;s logic only up to the non-modal
syllogistic, on the ground that this is as much as a practicing doctor
needs. For some doubts about Gutas&rsquo; conclusions, and some
broader context, see Watt 2008.</p>

 On F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; on Galen see Zimmermann 1981
(lxxxi&ndash;lxxxiv). F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; says in <em>Attainment
of Happiness</em> #63,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The philosophy that answers to this description was handed down to us
by the Greeks from Plato and Aristotle only. Both have given us an
account of philosophy, but not without giving us also an account of
the ways to it and the ways to reestablish it when it becomes confused
or extinct.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; sees himself as reestablishing scientific
philosophy when it has become, at best, confused. <em>Book of
Letters</em> III,222 p.210,12&ndash;15 mentions the possibility that
some science which the ancients had finished discovering has gone
extinct and needs a new dialectical investigation in order to
reestablish it as a science; and, he says, this can also happen within
some one (linguistic or religious) community that has not received
philosophy in a finished form.</p>

 There is an old-fashioned English translation of Ab&ucirc;
&#7716;ayy&acirc;n al-Taw&#7717;&icirc;d&icirc;&rsquo;s account of
this debate in Margoliouth 1905, and a more recent French translation
in Elamrani-Jamal 1983.</p>

 For a Muslim audience it would be uncontroversial that there are a
plurality of correct religions, each founded by a prophet sent from
God, typically each with their own sacred book and religious law, a
law which would include (but not necessarily be limited to) a set of
rituals, taboos, and so on, binding on that community but not on the
rest of the world.</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="word-being.html">F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; on the word for being, in Greek and Arabic</a></h2>

<div id="note-wb-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-wb-1">1.</a>
 &ldquo;Noun&rdquo;, in a Greek or Arabic context, must be taken to
include adjectives as well as what we would call common and proper
nouns.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-wb-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-wb-2">2.</a>
 Normal Arabic would be to use perfect and imperfect forms of the
verbal root <em>k-w-n</em>, saying &ldquo;<em>X</em>
<em>k&acirc;na</em> <em>Y</em>&rdquo; for the past and
&ldquo;<em>X</em> <em>yak&ucirc;nu</em> <em>Y</em>&rdquo; for the
future, and when not expressing a tense to say either just
&ldquo;<em>X</em> <em>Y</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>X</em> <em>huwa</em>
<em>Y</em>&rdquo;. But then either the tenseless copula is not
expressed or it is not linguistically related to the tensed copulas.
There is no reasonable way either to give a tenseless copula cognate
with <em>k-w-n</em> or to give a tensed copula cognate with
<em>huwa</em>; using <em>w-j-d</em> instead solves this problem.</p>

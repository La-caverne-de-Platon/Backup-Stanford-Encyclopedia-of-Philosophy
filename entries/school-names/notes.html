<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">School of Names</a></h2>

<div id="note-1"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 According to the <em>Han History</em>, Cheng-gong Sheng was the
author of five scrolls (<em>pian</em>) of writings, presumably
focusing on names. Liu Xiang (79&ndash;8 B.C.) thought that he lived at the
same as the son of Li Si, prime minister to the Qin emperor. His
contemporary Huang Gong, who wrote four scrolls, was a scholar of Qin
known for his songwriting. Mao Gong, author of nine scrolls, was from
the state of Zhao and served with Gongsun Long as a retainer to the
Lord of Pingyuan. Of Huan Tuan nothing is known. None of the writings
of these men have survived.</p></div>

<div id="note-2"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 On the similarities and dissimilarities between the School of Names
and the sophists, see Reding (1985) and Graham (1989).</p></div>

<div id="note-3"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Antonio Cua (1985) was among the first to point out the similarities
between Chinese disputation and legal reasoning. See also Garrett
(1993) and Harbsmeier (1998: 286&ndash;87).</p></div>

<div id="note-4"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 All citations to <em>Xunzi</em> will be by section numbers in
Knoblock&rsquo;s three-volume translation (1988, 1990, 1994).
Citations to <em>The Annals of L&uuml; Buwei</em> will be by section
number, appending the page number in Knoblock and Riegel (2000). All
translations from these and other texts are my own and are usually
slightly different from those in the English editions cited for
comparison. The passages referred to here are at <em>Xunzi</em> 5.6
and 5.9 and <em>The Annals of L&uuml; Buwei</em> 4.3/123. </p></div>

<div id="note-5"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Yang Zhu represented a form of ethical egoism. About Yang Zhu himself
we know little. He wrote no recorded texts, though he is mentioned in
a variety of sources and is said to have had an audience with King Hui
of Liang (370-319 B.C.). Mencius identifies him with the doctrine of
acting &ldquo;for oneself,&rdquo; so that to benefit the world he
would not sacrifice even a single hair from his body (7A:26). The
<em>Huainanzi</em>, a Han dynasty anthology, summarizes Yang&rsquo;s
doctrines as &ldquo;Keep the natural dispositions whole, protect the
genuine, do not get tangled up with things&rdquo; (Book 13, &ldquo;Fan
Lun Xun&rdquo;). </p></div>

<div id="note-6"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Graham seems to have been the first to argue explicitly for this
explanation (2003/1978: 172&ndash;173). </p></div>

<div id="note-7"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 See Graham 2003, Canons A66&ndash;67, B15. The explanation of <em>jian
bai</em> presented here is based on Graham (2003: 170-76).
Graham&rsquo;s account of the theoretical role of <em>jian bai</em> is
one of the many significant breakthroughs in his work on the later
Mohists. For an alternative account of the <em>jian bai</em> sophism,
see Makeham (1989), but compare Graham (2003: 176).</p></div>

<div id="note-8"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 There is an extant text called the <em>Dengxizi</em>, comprising two
very short books. However, as Chinese scholars recognized as early as
the Ming dynasty (1368&ndash;1644 C.E.), it is a later forgery, an
incoherent jumble of ideas and phrases plucked from a variety of
sources. It concerns mainly political and social issues, having little
relation to the reputed concerns of the disputers or to themes
associated with Deng Xi in genuine Warring States texts. Of the early
sources on Deng Xi, probably only the <em>Zuo Commentary</em> can be
considered reliable, since the text treats him as a minor figure
toward whom it has no axe to grind. The one-line entry on him was
probably written long after his lifetime, however. </p></div>

<div id="note-9"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 The short extant text in two books attributed to Yin Wen is a later
forgery, probably from the 3rd century C.E. See the detailed study by
Daor (1974) and the discussion in Harbsmeier (1998). </p></div>

<div id="note-10"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Graham rightly points out that Hui Shi explains what a <em>dan</em>
is by citing analogue and differentia, not genus and differentia
(1989: 81). But he characterizes Hui Shi&rsquo;s example as a
&ldquo;definition,&rdquo; when in fact a fascinating aspect of the
story is how the Chinese theoretical scheme employs no notion of
(intensional) definition. (By our lights, Hui Shi&rsquo;s response can
of course considered a nominal or extensional definition.) The
questioner simply asks what the features of <em>X</em> are like, and
the informant offers an analogy to show &ldquo;what <em>X</em> is
like.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div id="note-11"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 This account is inevitably indebted to Hansen (1992), Graham (1989),
and a range of Chinese commentators cited in the Qing dynasty
<em>Zhuangzi Jishi</em> of Guo Qingfan and the modern editions edited
by Chen Guying, <em>Zhuangzi Jinzhu Jinyi</em>, rev. ed. (Taipei:
Commercial Press, 2000), and Wang Shumin, <em>Zhuangzi Jiaoquan</em>
(Taipei: Academia Sinica, 1988). I have not attempted to credit these
sources one by one except for places where my own view was influenced
very directly by another writer&rsquo;s. The monistic interpretation
of the ten theses defended below was first proposed by Hu Shih (1922).
</p></div>

<div id="note-12"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 The word translated here as &ldquo;unit,&rdquo; <em>ti</em>, is also
the Mohist technical term for a part of a whole (Canon A2).
&ldquo;Units&rdquo; can in turn be treated as wholes, from which we
can separate out further parts. </p></div>

<div id="note-13"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 The paradox is distinct from a sorites paradox, which is based on
reiteration of minute, insignificant changes, not infinitesimals. But
there is a rough similarity between them. In both cases, a sum of
basic units, no matter how many, is insufficient to produce a
significant difference. Yet a significant difference exists and
somehow must be constituted by the basic units.</p></div>

<div id="note-14"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Hansen (1992: 262&ndash;63) and Graham (1989: 79) both follow Hu. Reding
(1985) defends a different interpretation.</p></div>

<div id="note-15"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 Hui Shi&rsquo;s &ldquo;one unit&rdquo; monism does not imply that the
differentiated world of perceptual experience is delusory, nor that
individual things are all formless blobs of protoplasm that can fuse
together. It arises from thinking of the cosmos according to the model
of a whole and its parts. Because distinctions between the parts can
be drawn in innumerably many ways, it seems that arbitrary human
convention is the only basis for distinguishing the parts one way
rather than another&mdash;for instance, for distinguishing different
kinds (<em>lei</em>) of things or &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; (<em>shi</em>)
one way rather than another. Without our cognitive activity,
individual things in themselves belong to neither one kind nor
another, nor are they even &ldquo;things&rdquo; (<em>wu</em>). Rather,
they are simply parts of a whole constituted by the cosmos and
everything in it. </p>

<p>
As an analogy, consider how we conceive of the human body. We can
recognize distinctions between the various parts of the body, such as
the arms, legs, and torso, or we can treat the body as a single whole,
forgetting for the moment any distinctions between its parts. Someone
could argue that arms, legs, and so on are distinct from each other
and from the body only in the sense that for some purposes we isolate
them conceptually. In reality, they are all just (parts of) the body.
The &ldquo;Great One&rdquo; or &ldquo;one unit&rdquo; idea is that in
an analogous way, the entire cosmos is a whole constituted by its
myriad parts, and the parts exist as various individuals and kinds
only because our cognitive activity divides them off from the whole.
</p>

<p>
Of course, we can distinguish different types of criteria for
identifying parts. Consider, for instance, the differences between
these sorts of parts: (a) a discrete individual part that is detached
from anything else, such as my body, which is unconnected to other
bodies; (b) an intuitively distinct part of my body, such as my right
index finger; (c) a random chunk of my body, such as a square
centimeter of flesh near the center of my left calve; (d) the part of
my body consisting of the fusion of my left ring finger, right eye,
and spleen. The principles by which we might classify such different
sorts of parts are a matter of discussion and controversy in
contemporary metaphysics (see the entry on
 <a href="../mereology/index.html">mereology</a>).
 They obviously have an important bearing on the grounds for Hui
Shi&rsquo;s monism, since it may well be the case that arbitrary human
convention is <em>not</em> the only basis for drawing distinctions
between things and kinds of things. </p></div>

<div id="note-16"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 An alternative interpretation of the text that avoids this
inconsistency would be that thesis 10 does not assert that the
&ldquo;one unit&rdquo; view is exclusively or absolutely correct, but
merely recommends it as an ethical stance. </p></div>

<div id="note-17"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Graham&rsquo;s conclusions, first published in 1957 and reprinted in
his (1990), have been widely accepted by European and American
scholars but almost completely ignored by scholars writing in Chinese.
His arguments are not unassailable. In philology knockdown arguments
are rare, and he perhaps overstates the force of some of his evidence.
But the parallels between the dubious parts of the <em>Gongsun
Longzi</em> and the Mohist <em>Canons</em> and <em>Explanations</em>
are extensive. They incorporate even phrases with scribal errors that
presumably had not yet occurred during the lifetime of the historical
Gongsun Long, since the later Mohist texts should be roughly
contemporaneous with him. Given the parallels, it would be a
miraculous coincidence if these parts of the <em>Gongsun Longzi</em>
had <em>not</em> been assembled from bits of the Canons. When we then
consider the nonsensical, banal content of the three questionable
dialogues, by far the best explanation of Graham&rsquo;s observations
is that they are forgeries. For a range of other views on the text,
see the essays collected in Suter, Indraccolo,&nbsp;and Behr, eds. (2020).
For an intriguing development of Graham&rsquo;s view, along with that of
the Chinese scholar Shen Youding, see Suter (2020). </p></div>

<div id="note-18"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 In the version of the story found in the <em>Annals</em> (1.4),
Confucius is one-upped by Laozi, who alone demonstrates the highest
level of impartiality. A Chu man loses his bow and says, &ldquo;A Chu
person lost it, a Chu person will find it. Why bother looking for
it?&rdquo; Confucius comments, &ldquo;Omit the &lsquo;Chu&rsquo; and
it&rsquo;ll be admissible.&rdquo; Laozi rejoins, &ldquo;Omit the
&lsquo;person&rsquo; and it&rsquo;ll be admissible.&rdquo; </p></div>

<div id="note-19"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 We will follow the traditional order of the text. Many interpreters
transpose and reconstruct parts of the text in response to suspected
textual corruption. The translation that follows is indebted in places
to both Graham (1989) and Harbsmeier (1998). </p></div>

<div id="note-20"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 This argument can also be read as treating white and horse as two
parts of a whole, as Graham suggests (1989). But doing so does not
really enhance the explanatory value of our interpretation, nor make
the argument more cogent. If we say that white horse is a whole with
two parts, one named by &lsquo;white&rsquo; and one by
&lsquo;horse&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s not clear how that helps us get from
&lsquo;naming the color is not naming the shape&rsquo; to &lsquo;white
horse not horse&rsquo;. The natural thing for the text to say, on a
part-whole reading, would be that &lsquo;white&rsquo; is not
&lsquo;horse&rsquo;. </p></div>

<div id="note-21"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 Harbsmeier also points out that by using the example of seeking a
horse, instead of having a horse, the sophist has created an
intensional context, making it that much easier to show that
&ldquo;white horse&rdquo; and &ldquo;horse&rdquo; are not
intersubstitutable and thus not identical (1998: 306). </p></div>

<div id="note-22"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 Following Wu Feibai and Harbsmeier (1998: 307, n2).</p></div>

<div id="note-23"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 Noting that Gongsun Long cites Confucius in the anecdote about the
King of Chu, Hansen (1992) suggests that he is proposing a language
reform as a defense of the Confucian theory of &ldquo;correcting
names.&rdquo; This strikes me as far-fetched, given that Gongsun was
notorious for twisting people&rsquo;s words and that his ethical
sympathies seem to have lain more with the Mohists than the
Confucians. Probably he cites Confucius as an authority in the
anecdote because Kong Chuan was a descendant of Confucius. </p></div>

<div id="note-24"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 Though the text mentions Hui Shi, it does not associate the paradoxes
with him, leaving it unclear whether the writer attributes them to him
specifically. Another point to note is that the text&rsquo;s awareness
of Gongsun Long&rsquo;s sophisms suggests that it is contemporaneous
with him. We cannot be sure of Gongsun Long&rsquo;s dates, so this
observation supports no firm conclusions about chronology. But it
seems likely that Gongsun Long was active mainly in the first half of
the 3rd century B.C., in which case &ldquo;Equalizing Things&rdquo;
may not be from the hand of the historical Zhuang Zhou, who is
supposed to have lived during the 4th century. Graham notes the
chronological difficulty but does not consider the possibility that
&ldquo;Equalizing Things&rdquo; may not be the work of Zhuang Zhou
(1989: 179).</p></div>

<h3>Notes to Supplement: Disputation in Context</h3>

<div id="note-26"><p>

 <a href="disputation.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 According to the <em>Bie Lu</em>, by Liu Xiang, this is a comment by
Zou Yan (ca. 250 B.C.) in reaction to Gongsun Long&rsquo;s frivolous
disputation that &ldquo;a white horse is not a horse.&rdquo; (See
<em>Shi Ji</em>, Book 76.) Versions of the passage are also found in
the 2nd-century B.C. <em>Hanshi Waizhuan</em> and in the
<em>Dengxizi</em>, a text of later, uncertain date that contains a
hodgepodge of material from various sources. The close parallels
between the three versions suggest that all are borrowing from a
widely circulated source of earlier date, probably 3rd century B.C.
For an alternative version of the passage, see Graham (2003),
20-21.</p></div>

<div id="note-27"><p>

 <a href="disputation.html#ref-27">27.</a>
 A &ldquo;starting point&rdquo; (<em>duan</em>) is the basis for a
distinct way of using a general term. As Xunzi explains,
&lsquo;honor&rsquo; has two &ldquo;starting points,&rdquo; honor with
respect to moral standing and honor with respect to social status. So
a person can be morally honorable while having low social status or
socially honored while being morally disgraceful. See John Knoblock,
<em>Xunzi: A Translation and Study of the Complete Works</em>, Vol. 3
(Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994), section 18.9. </p></div>

<div id="note-28"><p>

 <a href="disputation.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 Different groups of thinkers developed different answers to these
questions. The Mohists advocated a form of realism. Things are already
divided into different &ldquo;kinds&rdquo; (<em>lei</em>) by the
natural world itself, independent of human activity. Whether different
objects (<em>shi</em>) are similar or different is determined by
whether they are inherently similar, and thus &ldquo;of the same
kind.&rdquo;
 <a href="../xunzi/index.html">Xunzi</a>
 developed a nuanced pragmatic view. Some kind distinctions are
determined by how features of the natural world interact causally with
human sense organs. Because we all have similar sense organs, we
naturally tend to distinguish things similarly, allowing us to agree
on how to use names in consistent ways. Other distinctions are
determined by social conventions established by political leaders.
These are justified by their utility in bringing about a stable,
flourishing society. Some passages in the
 <a href="../zhuangzi/index.html"><em>Zhuangzi</em></a>
 go further toward pragmatism, implying that there is no need to
correct names in the first place, and attempting to do so is
pointless, since the task is impracticable anyway. Attempts to
implement such rigid standardization will only lead to worthless
squabbling and interfere with our ability to cope with change, perform
practical tasks successfully, and live a carefree, happy life. </p></div>

<h3>Notes to Supplement: Life of Hui Shi</h3>

<div id="note-29"><p>

 <a href="life-hui-shi.html#ref-29">29.</a>
 See Brooks (1996). Brooks&rsquo;s is probably the most informative
historical study of Hui Shi, and I have benefited from many of his
observations. </p></div>

<h1>Self-Deception</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Oct 17, 2006; substantive revision Mon Nov 7, 2016</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Virtually every aspect of self-deception, including its definition and
paradigmatic cases, is a matter of controversy among philosophers.
Minimally, self-deception involves a person who seems to acquire and
maintain some false belief in the teeth of evidence to the contrary as
a consequence of some motivation, and who may display behavior
suggesting some awareness of the truth. Beyond this, philosophers
divide over whether self-deception is intentional, involves belief or
some other sub-or-non-doxastic attitude, whether self-deceivers are
morally responsible for their self-deception, and whether
self-deception is morally problematic (and if it is in what ways and
under what circumstances), whether self-deception is beneficial or
harmful, whether and in what sense collectives can be self-deceived,
how this might affect individuals within such collectives, whether our
penchant for self-deception was selected for or merely an accidental
byproduct of our evolutionary history, and if it was selected,
why?</p>

<p>
The discussion of self-deception and its associated puzzles sheds
light on the ways motivation affects belief acquisition and retention
and other belief-like cognitive attitudes; it also prompts us to
scrutinize the notion of belief and the limits of such folk
psychological concepts to adequately explain phenomena of this sort.
And yet insofar as self-deception represents an obstacle to
self-knowledge, both individually and collectively, it is more than
just another interesting philosophical puzzle. It is a problem of
existential concern, since it suggests that there is a distinct
possibility that we live with distorted views of our selves, others
and the world that may make us strangers to ourselves and blind to the
nature of our significant moral engagements. </p>

<h2><a name="DefIss">1. Definitional Issues</a></h2>

<p>
What is self-deception? Traditionally, self-deception has been modeled
on interpersonal deception, where <em>A</em> intentionally gets
<em>B</em> to believe some proposition <em>p</em>, all the while
knowing or believing truly that ~<em>p</em>. Such deception is
intentional and requires the deceiver to know or believe that
~<em>p</em> and the deceived to believe that <em>p</em>. One reason
for thinking self-deception is analogous to interpersonal deception of
this sort is that it helps us to distinguish self-deception from mere
error, since the acquisition and maintenance of the false belief is
intentional not accidental. If self-deception is properly modeled on
such interpersonal deception, self-deceivers intentionally get
themselves to believe that <em>p</em>, all the while knowing or
believing truly that ~<em>p</em>. On this traditional model, then,
self-deceivers apparently must (1) hold contradictory beliefs, and (2)
intentionally get themselves to hold a belief they know or believe
truly to be false.</p>

<p>
The traditional model of self-deception, however, has been thought to
raise two paradoxes: One concerns the self-deceiver&rsquo;s state of
mind&mdash;the so-called &lsquo;static&rsquo; paradox. How can a
person simultaneously hold contradictory beliefs? The other concerns
the process or dynamics of self-deception&mdash;the so-called
&lsquo;dynamic&rsquo; or &lsquo;strategic&rsquo; paradox. How can a
person intend to deceive herself without rendering her intentions
ineffective? (Mele 1987a; 2001)</p>

<p>
The requirement that self-deceivers holds contradictory beliefs raises
the &lsquo;static&rsquo; paradox, since it seems to pose an impossible
state of mind, namely, consciously believing that <em>p</em> and
~<em>p</em> at the same time. As deceiver, she must believe that
~<em>p</em>, and, as deceived, she must believe that <em>p</em>.
Accordingly, the self-deceiver consciously believes that <em>p</em>
and ~<em>p</em>. But if believing both a proposition and its negation
in full awareness is an impossible state of mind to be in, then
self-deception as it has traditionally been understood seems to be
impossible as well.</p>

<p>
The requirement that the self-deceiver intentionally get herself to
hold a belief she knows to be false raises the &lsquo;dynamic&rsquo;
or &lsquo;strategic&rsquo; paradox, since it seems to involve the
self-deceiver in an impossible project, namely, both deploying and
being duped by some deceitful strategy. As deceiver, she must be aware
she&rsquo;s deploying a deceitful strategy; but, as the deceived, she
must be unaware of this strategy for it to be effective. And yet it is
difficult to see how the self-deceiver could fail to be aware of her
intention to deceive. A strategy known to be deceitful, however, seems
bound to fail. How could I be taken in by your efforts to get me to
believe something false, if I know what you&rsquo;re up to? But if
it&rsquo;s impossible to be taken in by a strategy one knows is
deceitful, then, again, self-deception as it has traditionally been
understood seems to be impossible as well.</p>

<p>
These paradoxes have led a minority of philosophers to be skeptical
that self-deception is conceptually possible or even coherent (Paluch
1967; Haight 1980; Kipp 1980). Borge (2003) contends that accounts of
self-deception inevitably give up central elements of our
folk-psychological notions of &ldquo;self&rdquo; or
&ldquo;deception&rdquo; to avoid paradox, leaving us to wonder whether
this framework itself is what gets in the way of explaining the
phenomenon. Such skepticism toward the concept may seem warranted,
given the obvious paradoxes involved. Most philosophers, however, have
sought some resolution to these paradoxes, instead of giving up on the
notion itself, not only because empirical evidence suggests that
self-deception is not only possible, but pervasive (Sahdra &amp;
Thagard 2003), but also because the concept does seem to pick out a
distinct kind of motivated irrationality. Philosophical accounts of
self-deception can be organized into two main groups: those that
maintain that the paradigmatic cases of self-deception are
intentional, and those that deny this. Call these approaches
<i>intentionalist</i> and <i>revisionist</i> respectively.
Intentionalists find the model of intentional interpersonal deception
apt, since it helps to explain the selectivity of self-deception and
the apparent responsibility of self-deceiver, as well as providing a
clear way of distinguishing self-deception from other sorts of
motivated belief such as wishful thinking. Revisionists are impressed
by the static and dynamic paradoxes allegedly involved in modeling
self-deception on intentional interpersonal deception and, in their
view, the equally puzzling psychological models used by
intentionalists to avoid these paradoxes, such as semi-autonomous
subsystems, unconscious beliefs and intentions and the like. To avoid
paradox and psychological exotica revisionist approaches reformulate
the intention requirement, the belief requirement or both.</p>

<h2><a name="IntApp">2. Intentionalist Approaches</a></h2>

<p>
The chief problem facing intentional models of self-deception is the
dynamic paradox, namely, that it seems impossible to form an intention
to get oneself to believe what one currently disbelieves or believes
is false. For one to carry out an intention to deceive oneself one
must know what one is doing, to succeed one must be ignorant of this
same fact. Intentionalists agree on the proposition that
self-deception is intentional, but divide over whether it requires the
holding of contradictory beliefs, and thus over the specific content
of the alleged intention involved in self-deception. Insofar as even
the bare intention to acquire the belief that <em>p</em> for reasons
not having to do with one&rsquo;s evidence for <em>p</em> seems
unlikely to succeed if directly known, most intentionalists introduce
some sort of temporal or psychological partition to insulate
self-deceivers from their deceptive stratagems. When self-deceivers
are not consciously aware of their beliefs to the contrary or their
deceptive intentions, no paradox seems to be involved in deceiving
oneself. Many approaches utilize some combination of psychological and
temporal division (e.g., Berm&uacute;dez 2000). </p>

<h3><a name="TemPar">2.1 Temporal Partitioning</a></h3>

<p>
Some intentionalists argue that self-deception is a complex process
that is often extended over time and as such a self-deceiver can
consciously set out to deceive herself into believing that <em>p</em>,
knowing or believing that ~<em>p</em>, and along the way lose her
belief that ~<em>p</em>, either forgetting her original deceptive
intention entirely, or regarding it as having, albeit accidentally,
brought about the true belief she would have arrived at anyway
(Sorensen 1985; Berm&uacute;dez 2000). So, for instance, an official
involved in some illegal behavior might destroy any records of this
behavior and create evidence that would cover it up (diary entries,
emails and the like), knowing that she will likely forget having done
these things over the next few months. When her activities are
investigated a year later, she has forgotten her tampering efforts and
based upon her falsified evidence comes to believe falsely that she
was not involved in the illegal activities of which she is accused.
Here the self-deceiver need never simultaneously hold contradictory
beliefs even though she intends to bring it about that she believes
that <em>p</em>, which she regards as false at the outset of the
process of deceiving herself and true at its completion. The
self-deceiver need not even forget her original intention to deceive,
so an unbeliever who sets out to get herself to believe in God (since
she thinks such a belief is prudent, having read Pascal) might well
remember such an intention at the end of the process and deem that by
God&rsquo;s grace even this misguided path led her to the truth. It is
crucial to see here that what enables the intention to succeed in such
cases is the operation of what Johnston (1988) terms &lsquo;autonomous
means&rsquo; (e.g., the normal degradation of memory, the tendency to
believe what one practices, etc.) not the continued awareness of the
intention. Some non-intentionalists take this to be a hint that the
process by which self-deception is accomplished is subintentional
(Johnston 1988). In any case, while it is clear that such temporal
partitioning accounts apparently avoid the static and dynamic
paradoxes, many find such cases fail to capture the distinctive
opacity, indirection and tension associated with garden-variety cases
of self-deception (Levy 2004). </p>

<h3><a name="PsyPar">2.2 Psychological Partitioning</a></h3>

<p>
Another strategy employed by intentionalists is the division of the
self into psychological parts that play the role of the deceiver and
deceived respectively. These strategies range from positing strong
division in the self, where the deceiving part is a relatively
autonomous subagency capable of belief, desire and intention (Rorty
1988); to more moderate division, where the deceiving part still
constitutes a separate center of agency (Pears 1984, 1986; 1991); to
the relatively modest division of Davidson, where there need only be a
boundary between conflicting attitudes (1982, 1986). Such divisions
are prompted in large part by the acceptance of the contradictory
belief requirement. It isn&rsquo;t simply that self-deceivers hold
contradictory beliefs, which though strange, isn&rsquo;t impossible.
One can believe that <em>p</em> and believe that ~<em>p</em> without
believing that <em>p</em> &amp; ~<em>p</em>, which would be
impossible. The problem such theorists face stems from the appearance
that the belief that ~<em>p</em> motivates and thus form a part of the
intention to bring it about that one acquire and maintain the false
belief that <em>p</em> (Davidson 1986). So, for example, the Nazi
official&rsquo;s recognition that his actions implicate him in serious
evil motivates him to implement a strategy to deceive himself into
believing he is not so involved; he can&rsquo;t intend to bring it
about that he holds such a false belief if he doesn&rsquo;t recognize
it is false, and he wouldn&rsquo;t want to bring such a belief about
if he didn&rsquo;t recognize the evidence to the contrary. So long as
this is the case, the deceptive subsystem, whether it constitutes a
separate center of agency or something less robust, must be hidden
from the conscious self being deceived if the self-deceptive intention
is to succeed. While these psychological partitioning approaches seem
to resolve the static and dynamic puzzles, they do so by introducing a
picture of the mind that raises many puzzles of its own. On this
point, there appears to be consensus even among intentionalists that
self-deception can and should be accounted for without invoking
divisions not already used to explain non-self-deceptive behavior,
what Talbott (1995) calls &lsquo;innocent&rsquo; divisions.</p>

<p>
Some intentionalists reject the requirement that self-deceivers hold
contradictory beliefs (Talbott 1995; Berm&uacute;dez 2000). According
to such theorists, the only thing necessary for self-deception is the
intention to bring it about that one believe that <em>p</em> where
lacking such an intention one would not have acquired that belief. The
self-deceiver thus need not believe that ~<em>p</em>. She might have
no views at all regarding <em>p</em>, possessing no evidence either
for or against <em>p</em>; or she might believe that <em>p</em> is
merely possible, possessing evidence for or against <em>p</em> too
weak to warrant belief that <em>p</em> or ~<em>p</em> (Berm&uacute;dez
2000). Self-deceivers in this minimal sense intentionally acquire the
belief that <em>p</em>, despite their recognition at the outset that
they do not possess enough evidence to warrant this belief by
selectively gathering evidence supporting <em>p</em> or otherwise
manipulating the belief-formation process to favor belief that
<em>p</em>. Even on this minimal account, such intentions will often
be unconscious, since a strategy to acquire a belief in violation of
one&rsquo;s normal evidential standards seems unlikely to succeed if
one is aware of it. </p>

<h2><a name="RevApp">3. Revisionist Approaches</a></h2>

<p>
A number of philosophers have moved away from modeling self-deception
directly on intentional interpersonal deception, opting instead to
revise either the intention or the belief requirement traditional
intentionalist models assume. Those revising the intention requirement
typically treat it self-deception as a species of motivationally
biased belief, thus avoiding the problems involved with intentionally
deceiving oneself. Call these non-intentionalist or deflationary
approaches. Those revising the belief requirement either posit some
other non-doxastic or quasi-doxastic attitude toward the proposition
involved (&lsquo;hopes&rsquo;, &lsquo;suspicions&rsquo;,
&lsquo;doubts&rsquo;, &lsquo;anxieties&rsquo; Edwards 2013;
&lsquo;besires&rsquo; Egan 2009; &lsquo;pretense&rsquo; Gendler 2007;
&lsquo;imagination&rsquo; Lazar 1999), or alter the content of the
proposition believed in a way that avoids the paradoxes associated
with the dual belief requirement embedded in traditional
intentionalist models of self-deception (e.g., Holton 2001; Funkhouser
2005; Fern&aacute;ndez 2013). Call these <i>revision of belief</i>
approaches. Deflationary approaches focus on the process of
self-deception, while the revision of belief approaches focus on the
product. A revision of either of these aspects, of course, has
ramifications for the other. For example, if self-deception
doesn&rsquo;t involve belief, but some other non-doxastic attitude
(product), then one may well be able to intentionally enter that state
without paradox (process). This section considers non-intentional or
deflationary approaches and the worries such approaches raise (3.1),
and revision of belief approaches (3.2) </p>

<h3><a name="RevInt">3.1 Revision of Intention: Non-Intentionalist or Deflationary Approaches</a></h3>

<p>
These non-intentionalists allow that phenomena answering to the
various intentionalist models available may be possible, but everyday
or &lsquo;garden-variety&rsquo; self-deception can be explained
without adverting to subagents, or unconscious beliefs and intentions,
which, even if they resolve the static and dynamic puzzles of
self-deception, raise many puzzles of their own. If such non-exotic
explanations are available, intentionalist explanations seem
unwarranted. </p>

<p>
The main paradoxes of self-deception seem to arise from modeling
self-deception too closely on intentional interpersonal deception.
Accordingly, non-intentionalists suggest the intentional model be
jettisoned in favor of one that takes &lsquo;to be deceived&rsquo; to
be nothing more than to believe falsely or be mistaken in believing
(Johnston 1988; Mele 2001). For instance, Sam mishears that it will be
a sunny day and relays this misinformation to Joan with the result
that she believes it will be a sunny day. Joan is deceived in
believing it will be sunny and Sam has deceived her, albeit
unintentionally. Initially, such a model may not appear promising for
self-deception, since simply being mistaken about <em>p</em> or
accidentally causing oneself to be mistaken about <em>p</em>
doesn&rsquo;t seem to be self-deception at all but some sort of
innocent error&mdash;Sam doesn&rsquo;t seem self-deceived, just
deceived. Non-intentionalists, however, argue that in cases of
self-deception the false belief is not accidental but motivated by
desire (Mele 2001), anxiety (Johnston 1988, Barnes 1997) or some other
emotion regarding <em>p</em> or related to <em>p</em>. So, for
instance, when Allison believes against the preponderance of evidence
available to her that her daughter is not having learning
difficulties, the non-intentionalist will explain the various ways she
misreads the evidence by pointing to such things as her desire that
her daughter not have learning difficulties, her fear that she has
such difficulties, or anxiety over this possibility. In such cases,
Allison&rsquo;s self-deceptive belief that her daughter is not having
learning difficulties, fulfills her desire, quells her fear or reduces
her anxiety, and it is this function (not an intention) that explains
why her belief formation process is bias. Allison&rsquo;s false belief
is not an innocent mistake, but a consequence of her motivational
states. </p>

<p>
Some non-intentionalists suppose that self-deceivers recognize at some
level that their self-deceptive belief that <em>p</em> is false,
contending that self-deception essentially involves an ongoing effort
to resist the thought of this unwelcome truth or is driven by anxiety
prompted by this recognition (Bach 1981; Johnston 1988). So, in
Allison&rsquo;s case, her belief that her daughter is having learning
difficulties along with her desire that it not be the case motivate
her to employ means to avoid this thought and to believe the opposite.
Others, however, argue the needed motivation can as easily be supplied
by uncertainty or ignorance whether <em>p</em>, or suspicion that
~<em>p</em> (Mele 2001, Barnes 1997). Thus, Allison need not hold any
opinion regarding her daughter&rsquo;s having learning difficulties
for her false belief that she is not experiencing difficulties to
count as self-deception, since it is her regarding evidence in a
motivationally biased way in the face of evidence to the contrary, not
her recognition of this evidence, that makes her belief
self-deceptive. Accordingly, Allison need not intend to deceive
herself nor believe at any point that her daughter is in fact having
learning difficulties. If we think someone like Allison is
self-deceived, then self-deception requires neither contradictory
beliefs nor intentions regarding the acquisition or retention of the
self-deceptive belief. Such approaches are &lsquo;deflationary&rsquo;
in the sense that they take self-deception to be explicable without
reaching for what Mele calls &lsquo;mental exotica&rsquo; (Mele 2001).
(For more on this sort of objection see <em>Self-Deception and
Tension</em> below).</p>

<p>
On such deflationary views of self-deception, one need only hold a
false belief that <em>p</em>, possess evidence that ~<em>p</em>, and
have some desire or emotion that explains why <em>p</em> is believed
and retained. In general, if one possesses evidence that one normally
would take to support ~<em>p</em> and yet believes that <em>p</em>
instead due to some desire, emotion or other motivation one has
related to <em>p</em>, then one is self-deceived. </p>

<h4>Deflationary Worries and Modifications</h4>

<p>
Critics contend these deflationary accounts do not adequately
distinguish self-deception from other sorts of motivated believing
such as wishful thinking, cannot explain the peculiar selectivity
associated with self-deception, its characteristic
&lsquo;tension&rsquo;, or they way it involves a failure of
self-knowledge.</p>

<p>
<em>Self-Deception and Wishful Thinking</em>: What distinguishes
wishful thinking from self-deception, according to intentionalists,
just is that the latter is intentional while the former is not (e.g.,
Berm&uacute;dez 2000). Non-intentionalists respond that what
distinguishes wishful thinking from self-deception is that
self-deceivers recognize evidence against their self-deceptive belief
whereas wishful thinkers do not (Bach 1981; Johnston 1988), or merely
possess, without recognizing, greater counterevidence than wishful
thinkers. Scott-Kakures (2002) argues that in &ldquo;wishful believing
the subject&rsquo;s cognition is hijacked by desire, while in
self-deception the subject is a willing participant in directing
cognition towards the doxastic embrace of the favored
proposition.&rdquo; For Scott-Kakures, motivation exerts an influence
on the self-deceivers reflective reasoning and hypothesis testing that
the self-deceivers mistakenly believe to be free of such bias. For
wishful thinkers motivation plays triggers a belief formation process
in which the person does not play an active, conscious role
(Scott-Kakures 2002; see also, Szabados 1973). While the precise
relationship between wishful thinking and self-deception is clearly a
matter of debate, there are plausible ways of distinguishing the two
that do not invoke the intention to deceive. </p>

<p>
<em>Self-Deception and Selectivity</em>: Another objection raised by
intentionalists is that deflationary accounts cannot explain the
selective nature of self-deception, termed the &lsquo;selectivity
problem&rsquo; by Berm&uacute;dez (1997, 2000). Why is it, such
intentionalists ask, that we are not rendered bias in favor of the
belief that <em>p</em> in many cases where we have a very strong
desire that <em>p</em> (or anxiety or some other motivation related to
<em>p</em>)? Intentionalists argue that an intention to get oneself to
acquire the belief that <em>p</em> offers a relatively straightforward
answer to this question. Mele (2001), drawing on empirical research
regarding lay hypothesis testing (Trope and Lieberman 1996), argues
that selectivity may be explained in terms of the agent&rsquo;s
assessment of the relative costs of erroneously believing that
<em>p</em> and ~<em>p</em>. So, for example, Josh would be happier
believing falsely that the gourmet chocolate he finds so delicious
isn&rsquo;t produced by exploited farmers than falsely believing that
it is, since he desires that it not be so produced. Because Josh
considers the cost of erroneously believing his favorite chocolate is
tainted by exploitation to be very high&mdash;no other chocolate gives
him the same pleasure, it takes a great deal more evidence to convince
him that his chocolate is so tainted than it does to convince him
otherwise. It is the low subjective cost of falsely believing the
chocolate is not tainted that facilitates Josh&rsquo;s self-deception.
But we can imagine Josh having the same strong desire that his
chocolate not be tainted by exploitation and yet assessing the cost of
falsely believing it is not tainted differently. Say, for example, he
works for an organization promoting fair trade and non-exploitive
labor practices among chocolate producers and believes he has an
obligation to accurately represent the labor practices of the producer
of his favorite chocolate and would, furthermore, lose credibility if
the chocolate he himself consumes is tainted by exploitation. In these
circumstances, Josh is more sensitive to evidence that his favorite
chocolate is tainted, despite his desire that it not be, since the
subjective cost of being wrong is higher for him than it was before.
It is the relative subjective costs of falsely believing <em>p</em>
and ~<em>p</em> that explains why desire or other motivation biases
belief in some circumstances and not others.</p>

<p>
Challenging this solution, Berm&uacute;dez (2000) suggests that the
selectivity problem may reemerge, since it isn&rsquo;t clear why we
frequently do not become self-deceived in cases where there is a
relatively low cost for holding a self-deceptive belief favored by our
motivations. Mele (2001), however, points out that intentional
strategies have their own &lsquo;selectivity problem&rsquo;, since it
isn&rsquo;t clear why some intentions to acquire a self-deceptive
belief succeed while others do not.</p>

<p>
Smith (2014) also addresses a version of the selectivity problem,
proposing a way to account for the the selectivity and apparent
success aptness of self-deception without resorting to intentions. In
his view, deflationary strategies like Mele&rsquo;s end up making
self-deception an accidental byproduct of having particular
motivational states and therefore not easily distinguished from other
sorts of motivated believing. Smith looks to examples of deception in
non-human organisms to find a way to explain the
&ldquo;teleofunctional&rdquo; nature of self-deception without having
to attribute intentions. Smith points out that when a mirror orchid
deceives a male scolid wasp by mimicking the appearance and odor of a
female scolid wasp, the deception in question can hardly be considered
accidental even though the orchid lacks the capacity for intentional
behavior. With this sort of deception in mind, Smith proposes an
alternative non-intentional model in which a &ldquo;subpersonal neural
mechanism with the proper fuction of selectively inhibiting the
process of producing or extracting information from subdoxastic
models&rdquo; accounts for self-deceivers false belief without
requiring an intention to deceive. Moreover, by proposing that true
information is encoded in some sub-doxastic state, Smith thinks the
selectivity of self-deception may also be accounted for. In this
latter sense, Smith might be viewed as both a revision of intention
and a revision of belief theorist (more on the latter below).</p>

<p>
<em>Self-Deception and Tension</em>: A number of philosophers have
complained that deflationary account fails to explain a certain
&lsquo;tension&rsquo; supposed to be present in cases of genuine
self-deception (e.g., Audi 1997; Bach 1997; Nelkin 2002; Funkhouser
2005; Fern&aacute;ndez 2013). This &lsquo;tension&rsquo; involves some
sort of psychic or behavioral &lsquo;conflict&rsquo;. Self-deceivers
are said to experience &lsquo;doubts&rsquo;, &lsquo;suspicions&rsquo;,
and the like regarding <em>p</em>, and to display ambiguous behavior
some pointing toward belief that <em>p</em> and some toward
<em>~p</em>. Since deflationary approaches deny that self-deceivers
reject the dual belief requirement, specifically, denying that
self-deceivers need to hold that <em>~p</em>, it seems difficult for
such approaches to explain why self-deceivers would struggle with
doubts or display behavior at variance with their false belief that
<em>p</em>. Regarding the former, deflationary theorists accept the
possibility that self-deceivers may &lsquo;suspect&rsquo; or think
there is a significant chance that <em>~p</em> (Mele 2001, 2009,
2010). Clearly, a person who believes that <em>p</em> and suspects
that <em>~p</em> may experience tension, moreover, such attitudes
combined with a desire that <em>p</em> help explain certain sorts of
avoidance behavior highlighted by critics. For his part, Mele things
self-deception may often involve tension, but it certainly need not,
that is, some self-deception is tension free. While Lynch (2012) does
not think tension is <em>necessary</em>, he accepts the idea that it
is <em>characteristic</em> of self-deception, and can be accounted for
by construing self-deception as involving an unwarranted degree of
confidence that <em>p</em>, rather than wholehearted belief that
<em>p</em> as Mele does. On Lynch&rsquo;s version of deflation,
self-deceivers will encounter and appreciate evidence that casts doubt
their assumption that <em>p</em>. This appreciation serves to motivate
&ldquo;attempts to deal with it (by, for example, trying to explain it
away)&rdquo; and explains the doubts regarding <em>p</em> critics have
identified.</p>

<p>
As Lynch (2012) points out, these tensions are not the only, or
perhaps, the central one&rsquo;s raised by critics of deflation. For such
critics, self-deception involves a deeper behavioral conflict.
Specifically, what self-deceivers say about <em>p</em> is at odds with
their non-verbal behavior, which justifies the attribution of the
belief that <em>~p</em> (Audi, 1997; Patten 2003; Funkhouser 2005;
Fern&aacute;ndez 2013). For example, Ellen says that she is doing well
in her biology class, but systematically avoids looking at the results
on her quizzes and tests. She says she doesn&rsquo;t need to look; she
knows she didn&rsquo;t miss anything. When her teacher tries to catch her
after class to discuss her poor grades, she is rushes off. Similarly,
when she sees an email from her teacher, she ignores it. Ellen&rsquo;s
behavior suggests to these critics that she knows she is not doing
well in her biology class, despite her avowals to the contrary.
Insofar as deflationary approaches deny people like Ellen know the
truth, they fail adequately to explain her self-deception. While some
propose these cases as a <em>type</em> of self-deception deflation
cannot explain (Fern&aacute;ndez 2013), others go further, suggesting
these cases show that deflation is not an account of self-deception at
all, but of self-delusion (Audi 2007; Funkhouser 2005). In either
case, critics think such cases cannot adequately be explained by
deflationary account.</p>

<p>
The significant difference between what deflationary accounts have in
view (namely, people who do not believe the unwelcome truth that
<em>~p</em>, having a motivation driven, unwarranted skepticism toward
it), and deep conflict theorist do (namely, people who know the
unwelcome truth that <em>~p</em> and avoid reflecting on it or
encountering evidence for it) prompts us to ask whether these
phenomena belong to the same psychological kind, according to Lynch
(2012). If they did, &lsquo;self-deception&rsquo; would be rendered
ambiguous. As Mele (2010) points out, anyone meeting his first
condition, namely, acquiring the false belief that <em>p</em> could
not be self-deceived on deep conflict approaches (Audi 1997, 2007;
Gendler 2007). Similarly, anyone meeting Audi&rsquo;s condition that
self-deceivers are merely disposed to avow sincerely that <em>p</em>
when they unconsciously believe that <em>~p</em> could not be
self-deceived on deflationary models like Mele&rsquo;s. So, which
approach has correctly identified the meaning of
&lsquo;self-deception&rsquo;? Lynch (2012) argues that
&lsquo;deep-conflict&rsquo; cases do not obviously resemble cases of
interpersonal deception, &ldquo;making it a mystery why they would be
considered species of the same genus.&rdquo; To be fair, such
approaches do reflect the fact that deceivers often know the truth,
but it does seem strange to say a person could not be deceived
regarding <em>p</em> just because they actually hold this false
belief. In view of these sorts of considerations, Lynch (2012) argues
that such deep conflict cases are not properly understood as
self-deception, but more nearly resemble what Longeway (1990) calls
&lsquo;escapism&rsquo;. Whether such cases constitute a distinct
psychological kind or not, or whether they reflect people&rsquo;s
pretheoretical understanding of self-deception remains unclear, but
deflationary approaches do seem to be capable of explaining some of
the behavior such theorists insist justifies attributing an
unconscious belief that <em>~p</em>. Moreover, deep conflict theorists
need to explain why we should think one avowing that <em>p</em> does
not also believe it, and why the behavior in question cannot be
explained by nearby proxies like suspicion that <em>p</em> (Mele
2010). </p>.

<p>
<em>Self-Deception and Self-Knowledge</em>: A number of theorists have
argued that deflationary approaches fail to capture the distinctive
failure of self-knowledge involved in cases of self-deception (Holton,
2001; Scott-Kakures 2002; Funkhouser 2005; Fern&aacute;ndez 2013).
Holton (2001) argues that Mele&rsquo;s conditions for being
self-deceived are not sufficient, because they do not require
self-deceivers to hold false beliefs about themselves. It seems
possible for a person to acquire a false belief that <em>p</em> as a
consequence of treating data relevant to <em>p</em> in a
motivationally biased way, when the data available to her provides
greater warrant for <em>p</em>, in such a way that she retains
accurate self-knowledge. Such a person would readily admit to ignoring
certain data, because it would undermine a belief she cherishes. She
makes no mistakes about herself, her beliefs or her belief formation
process. Such a person, Holton argues, would be willfully ignorant,
but not self-deceived. If, however, her strategy was sufficiently
opaque to her, she would be apt to deny that she was ignoring relevant
evidence, and affirm that her belief was the result of what
Scott-Kakures (2002) calls &ldquo;reflective, critical reasoning.&rdquo; These
erroneous beliefs represent a failure of self-knowledge that seems,
according to these critics, essential to self-deception. Scott-Kakures
(2002) contends that this sort of error is also what distinguishes
self-deception from wishful thinking (see above) and restricts it to
those capable of higher-order beliefs. Mele (2010), for his part,
thinks adding the following sufficient condition to his account would
put to rest these concerns:</p>

<blockquote>
S&lsquo;s acquiring the believe that <em>p</em> is a product of
&ldquo;reflective, critical reasoning,&rdquo; and S is wrong in
regarding that reasoning as properly directed.
</blockquote>

<p>
Fern&aacute;ndez (2013) distinguishes this sort of self-knowledge
error, which focus on the justification of one&rsquo;s beliefs, from
those that involve errors about what one believes. One worry about
characterizing the failure in terms of justification, according to
Fern&aacute;ndez (2013), is that it requires a degree of awareness
about one&rsquo;s reasons for believing that would rule out those who
do not engage in reflection on their reasons for belief.
Fern&aacute;ndez (2013), like Funkhouser (2005), endorses an error
about belief approach to account for the sort of &lsquo;deep
conflict&rsquo; cases described above. Whether Mele&rsquo;s (2010)
proposed condition requires too much sophistication from
self-deceivers is debatable, but it does suggests a way of accounting
for the intuition that self-deceivers fail to know themselves that
does not require them to harbor hidden beliefs or intentions.</p>

<h3><a name="RevBel">3.2 Revision of Belief: Adjustment of Attitude or Content</a></h3>

<p>
Approaches that focus on revising the notion that self-deception
requires holding that <em>p</em> and <em>~p</em>, the dual-belief
requirement implied by traditional intentionalism, either introduce
some &ldquo;doxastic proxy&rdquo; (Baghramian and Nicholson 2013) to
replace one or both beliefs, or alter the content of the
self-deceiver&rsquo;s belief in a way that preserves tension without
involving outright conflict. These approaches resolve the doxastic
paradox either by denying that self-deceivers believe that <em>p</em>,
the welcome but unwarranted belief (Audi 1982, 1988; Funkhouser 2005;
Gendler 2007; Fern&aacute;dez 2013), by denying that they believe that
<em>~p</em>, the unwelcome but warranted belief (Barnes 1997; Mele
2001), or by denying that they hold either that <em>p</em> or
<em>~p</em> (Edwards 2013; Porcher 2012). </p>

<p>
<em>Denying the Unwelcome Belief</em>: As noted above, deflationary
approaches in the tradition of Mele, deny that self-deceivers need to
hold the unwelcome but warranted belief that <em>~p</em>.[; it is
sufficient for self-deceivers to acquire the unwarranted false belief
that <em>p</em> in a motivated way.] To explain the selectivity and
tension that are often cited as reasons for attributing <em>~p</em> to
self-deceivers, Mele contends an attitude of suspicion, not belief,
<em>~p</em>, would suffice. He also suggests that beliefs other than
the belief that <em>~p</em> could do the necessary work without being
directly contrary to what the self-deceiver comes to believe. Citing
Rorty&rsquo;s (1988) case of Dr. Androvna, a cancer specialist who
believes she does not have cancer, but who draws up a detailed will
and writes uncharacteristically effusive letters suggesting her
impending departure, Mele (2009) points out that Androvna&rsquo;s behavior
might easily be explained by her holding another belief, namely,
&ldquo;there is a significant chance that she has cancer.&rdquo; And, this
belief is compatible with Androvna&rsquo;s belief that she does not, in
fact, have cancer.</p>

<p>
<em>Denying the Welcome Belief</em>: Another strand of revision of
belief approaches focuses on the welcome belief that <em>p</em>,
proposing a variety of alternatives to this belief that function in
ways that explain what self-deceivers typically say and do.
Self-deceivers display ambiguous behavior that not only falls short of
what one would expect from a person who believes that <em>p</em>, but
actually justifies the attribution of the belief that <em>~p</em>. For
instance, Androvna&rsquo;s letter writing and will preparation might be
taken as reasons for attributing to her the belief that she won&rsquo;t
recover, despite her verbal assertions to the contrary. Accordingly,
Robert Audi (1982, 1988) attributes the unconscious belief that
<em>~p</em> to self-deceivers and proposes sincere avowal or a
disposition to avow that <em>p</em> as a proxy for the belief that
<em>p</em>. Sincere avowal that <em>p</em> does not entail belief that
<em>p</em>, though belief-like, it does not carry with it &ldquo;the full
range of behavior one would expect from genuine belief&rdquo; (Audi 1988).
Sincere avowal isn&rsquo;t exactly an attitude toward the proposition, but
may suggest some non-doxastic attitude is at play in the disposition
to avow. Gendler (2007) suggests &lsquo;pretense&rsquo; that
<em>p</em> plays the role of belief in terms &ldquo;introspective
vivicy, motivation of action in a wide range of circumstances.&rdquo;
Unlike belief, however, pretense is reality indifferent: this attitude
is held primarily because the self-deceiver wishes to dwell in a world
in which <em>p</em> obtains. Lazar (1999) closely resembles Gendler in
taking self-deceptive beliefs to be better understood along the lines
of imaginations or fantasies that directly express the self-deceivers
wishes, fears, hopes and the like, since they show a relative
insensitivity to evidence (unlike beliefs) but guide behavior (like
beliefs). Along these lines Egan (2009) proposes an intermediate state
between belief and desire, &lsquo;besire&rsquo;, to account for the
special pattern of behavior displayed by self-deceivers.</p>

<p>
Others, instead of adjusting the attitude toward the welcome
proposition <em>p</em> by offering a non-doxastic proxy, substitute a
higher-order belief (Funkhouser 2005; Fern&aacute;ndez 2013).
Funkhouser (2005), for instance, contends that self-deceivers
don&rsquo;t believe <em>p</em>, they believe that they believe that
<em>p</em>, and this false second-order belief &ldquo;I think that I
believe that <em>p</em>&rdquo; underlies and underwrites their sincere
avowal that <em>p</em> as well as their ability to entertain
<em>p</em> as true. In this way, self-deception is a kind of failure
of self-knowledge, a misapprehension or misattribution of one&rsquo;s own
beliefs. By shifting the content of the self-deceptive belief to the
second-order, this approach not only avoids the doxastic paradox, it
explains the characteristic &lsquo;tension&rsquo; or
&lsquo;conflict&rsquo; attributed to self-deceivers in terms of the
disharmony between the first-order and second-order beliefs, the
latter explaining their avowed belief and the former their behavior
that goes against that avowed belief (Funkhouser 2005;
Fern&aacute;ndez 2013).</p>

<p>
<em>Denying both the Welcome Belief and the Unwelcome Belief:</em>
Given the variety of proxies that have been offered for both the
welcome and the unwelcome belief, it should not be surprising that
some argue that self-deception can be explained without attributing
either belief to self-deceivers, a position Edwards (2013) refers to
as &lsquo;nondoxasticism&rsquo;. Porcher (2012) recommends against
attributing beliefs to self-deceivers on the grounds that what they
believe is indeterminate, since they are, as Schwitzgebel (2001, 2010)
contends, &ldquo;in-between-believing,&rdquo; neither fully believing
that <em>p</em> nor fully not believing that <em>p</em>. For Porcher
(2012), self-deceivers show the limits of the folk psychological
concepts of belief and suggest the need to develop a dispositional
account of self-deception that focuses on the ways that
self-deceivers&rsquo; dispositions deviate from those of stereotypical
full belief. Funkhouser (2009) also points to the limits of folk
psychological concepts and suggests that in cases involving deep
conflict between behavior and avowal &ldquo;the self-deceived produce
a confused belief-like condition so that it is genuinely indeterminate
what they believe regarding <em>p</em>.&rdquo; Edwards (2013),
however, rejects the claim that the belief is indeterminate or that
folk psychological concepts are inadequate. She argues that folk
psychology offers a wide variety of nondoxastic attitudes such as
&lsquo;hope,&rsquo; &lsquo;suspicion,&rsquo; &lsquo;anxiety,&rsquo; and the like that are more
than sufficient to explain self-deception without adverting to belief.
In her view, the so-called doxastic problem can be resolved simply by
avoiding the attribution of doxastic attitudes of any kind.</p>

<p>
While revision of belief approaches suggest a number of
non-paradoxical ways of thinking about self-deception. Some worry that
those approaches denying that self-deceivers hold the welcome but
unwarranted belief that <em>p</em> eliminate what is central to the
notion of self-deception, namely, <em>deception</em> (see e.g., Lynch
2012, Mele 2010). On such approaches, self-deceivers may be mistaken
about what they believe, but they don&rsquo;t actually hold an
unwarranted belief regarding the target proposition at the first-order
level. However, those approaches focusing on higher-order beliefs
locate the deception or error at the second-order level. The
Self-deceiver&rsquo;s false belief that she believe that <em>p</em> is
unwarranted and may well be the result of motivation (Funkhouser 2005;
Fern&aacute;ndez 2013). Interestingly, if this false second-order
belief is acquired in a suitably biased way, it may fit Mele&rsquo;s
deflationary protoanalysis (Mele 2009), which is not restricted to
first-order beliefs, thus capturing the intuition that self-deceivers
are, in fact, deceived about something. Whatever the verdict, these
revision of belief approaches suggest that our way of characterizing
belief may not be fine-grained enough to account for the subtle
attitudes or meta-attitudes self-deceivers bear to the proposition in
question. Taken together these approaches make it clear that the
question regarding what self-deceivers believe is by means
resolved.</p>

<h2><a name="TwiSelDec">4. Twisted Self-Deception </a></h2>

<p>
Self-deception that involves the acquisition of an unwanted belief,
termed &lsquo;twisted self-deception&rsquo; by Mele (1999, 2001), has
generated a small but growing literature of its own, most recently,
Barnes (1997), Mele (1999, 2001), Scott-Kakures (2000; 2001). A
typical example of such self-deception is the jealous husband who
believes on weak evidence that his wife is having an affair, something
he doesn&rsquo;t want to be the case. In this case, the husband
apparently comes to have this false belief in the face of strong
evidence to the contrary in ways similar to those ordinary
self-deceivers come to believe something they want to be true. </p>

<p>
One question philosophers have sought to answer is how a single
unified account of self-deception can explain both welcome and
unwelcome beliefs. If a unified account is sought, then it seems
self-deception cannot require that the self-deceptive belief itself be
desired. Pears (1984) has argued that unwelcome belief might be driven
by fear or jealousy. My fear of my house burning down might motivate
my false belief that I have left the stove burner on. This unwelcome
belief serves to ensure that I avoid what I fear, since it leads me to
confirm that the burner is off. Barnes (1997) argues that the
unwelcome belief must serve to reduce some relevant anxiety; in this
case my anxiety that my house is burning. Scott-Kakures (2000; 2001)
argues, however, that since the unwelcome belief itself does not in
many cases serve to reduce but rather to increase anxiety or fear,
their reduction cannot be the purpose of that belief. Instead, he
contends that we think of the belief as serving to make the
agent&rsquo;s goals and interests more probable than not, in my case,
preserving my house. My testing and confirming an unwelcome belief may
be explained by the costs I associate with being in error, which is
determined in view of my relevant aims and interests. If I falsely
believe that I have left the burner on, the cost is relatively
low&mdash;I am inconvenienced by confirming that it is off. If I
falsely believe that I have not left the burner on, the cost is
extremely high&mdash;my house being destroyed by fire. The asymmetry
between these relative costs alone may account for my manipulation of
evidence confirming the false belief that I have left the burner on.
Drawing upon recent empirical research, both Mele (2001) and
Scott-Kakures (2000) advocate a model of this sort, since it helps to
account for the roles desires and emotions apparently play in cases of
twisted self-deception. Specifically, Mele refuses to identify the
motivating desire as a desire that <em>p</em>, leaving the content of
the motivation in question open. Nelkin (2002), however, argues that
the motivation for self-deceptive belief formation should be
restricted to a desire to <em>believe</em> that <em>p</em>. She points
out that the phrase &ldquo;unwelcome belief&rdquo; is ambiguous, since
a belief itself might be desirable even if its being true is not. I
might want to hold the belief that I have left the burner on, but not
want it to be the case that I have left it on. The belief is desirable
in this instance, because holding it ensures that it will not be true.
In Nelkin&rsquo;s view, then, what unifies cases of
self-deception&mdash;both twisted and straight&mdash;is that the
self-deceptive belief is motivated by a desire to believe that
<em>p</em>; what distinguishes them is that twisted self-deceivers do
not want <em>p</em> to be the case, while straight self-deceivers do.
Restricting the motivating desire to a desire to believe that
<em>p</em>, according to Nelkin, makes clear what twisted and straight
self-deception have in common as well as why other forms of motivated
belief formation are not cases of self-deception. Mele (2009) argues
that self-deceivers need not have the specific desire to believe that
<em>p</em>, since a variety of other desires might well alter the
acceptance thresholds such that <em>p</em> is believed, even a desire
not to acquire a false belief that <em>p</em> might serve to motivate
self-deceptive belief that <em>p</em>. </p>

<p>
Nelkin (2012) acknowledges the boundaries between cases of
self-deception and other sorts of irrational motivated belief are
blurry, but notes that scrutiny of the content of the motivation is
necessary for adjudicating individual cases, and suggests that the
nearer this content gets to the desire to believe that <em>p</em> the
more clearly it is a case of self-deception. Moreover, she contends
that her &ldquo;desire to believe&rdquo; model helps to differentiate
self-deception from other cases of motivated biased belief and to
explain why self-deceivers may be morally responsible in some cases
(see section 5.1 below). Though non-intentional models of twisted
self-deception dominate the landscape, whether desire, emotion or some
combination of these attitudes plays the dominant role in such
self-deception and whether their influence merely triggers the process
or continues to guide it throughout remain matters of controversy.
</p>

<h2><a name="MorSelDec">5. Morality and Self-deception</a></h2>

<p>
Despite the fact that much of the contemporary philosophical
discussion of self-deception has focused on epistemology,
philosophical psychology and philosophy of mind, the morality of
self-deception has been the central focus of discussion historically.
As a threat to moral self-knowledge, a cover for immoral activity, and
a violation of authenticity, self-deception has been thought to be
morally wrong or, at least, morally dangerous. Some thinkers, what
Martin (1986) calls &lsquo;the vital lie tradition&rsquo;, however,
have held that self-deception can in some instances be salutary,
protecting us from truths that would make life unlivable (e.g., Rorty
1972; 1994). There are two major questions regarding the morality of
self-deception: First, can a person be held morally responsible for
self-deception and if so under what conditions? Second, is there is
anything morally problematic with self-deception, and if so, what and
under what circumstances? The answers to these questions are clearly
intertwined. If self-deceivers cannot be held responsible for
self-deception, then their responsibility for whatever morally
objectionable consequences it might have will be mitigated if not
eliminated. Nevertheless, self-deception might be morally significant
even if one cannot be taxed for entering into it. To be ignorant of
one&rsquo;s moral self, as Socrates saw, may represent a great
obstacle to a life well lived whether or not one is at fault for such
ignorance.</p>

<h3><a name="MorResForSelDec">5.1 Moral Responsibility for Self-Deception</a></h3>

<p>
Whether self-deceivers can be held responsible for their
self-deception is largely a question of whether they have the
requisite control over the acquisition and maintenance of their
self-deceptive belief. In general, intentionalists hold that
self-deceivers are responsible, since they intend to acquire the
self-deceptive belief, usually recognizing the evidence to the
contrary. Even when the intention is indirect, such as when one
intentionally seeks evidence in favor of <em>p</em> or avoids
collecting or examining evidence to the contrary, self-deceivers seem
intentionally to flout their own normal standards for gathering and
evaluating evidence. So, minimally, they are responsible for such
actions and omissions. </p>

<p>
Initially, non-intentionalist approaches may seem to remove the agent
from responsibility by rendering the process by which she is
self-deceived subintentional. If my anxiety, fear, or desire triggers
a process that ineluctably leads me to hold the self-deceptive belief,
I cannot be held responsible for holding that belief. How can I be
held responsible for processes that operate without my knowledge and
which are set in motion without my intention? Most non-intentionalist
accounts, however, do allow for the possibility that self-deceivers
are responsible for individual episodes of self-deception, or for the
vices of cowardice and lack of self-control from which they spring, or
both. To be morally responsible in the sense of being an appropriate
target for praise or blame requires, at least, that agents have
control over the actions in question. Mele (2001), for example, argues
that many sources of bias are controllable and that self-deceivers can
recognize and resist the influence of emotion and desire on their
belief acquisition and retention, particularly in matters they deem to
be important, morally or otherwise. The extent of this control,
however, is an empirical question. Nelkin (2012), however, argues that
since Mele&rsquo;s account leaves the content of motivation driving
the bias unrestricted, the mechanism in question is so complex that
&ldquo;it seems unreasonable to expect the self-deceiver to [be] guard
against&rdquo; its operation. </p>

<p>
Other non-intentionalists take self-deceivers to be responsible for
certain epistemic vices such as cowardice in the face of fear or
anxiety and lack of self-control with respect the biasing influences
of desire and emotion. Thus, Barnes (1997) argues that self-deceivers
&ldquo;can, with effort, in some circumstances, resist their
biases&rdquo; (83) and &ldquo;can be criticized for failing to take
steps to prevent themselves from being biased; they can be criticized
for lacking courage in situations where having courage is neither
superhumanly difficult nor costly&rdquo; (175). Whether self-deception
is due to a character defect or not, ascriptions of responsibility
depend upon whether the self-deceiver has control over the biasing
effects of her desires and emotions. </p>

<p>
Levy (2004) has argued that non-intentional accounts of self-deception
that deny the contradictory belief requirement should not suppose that
self-deceivers are typically responsible, since it is rarely the case
that self-deceivers possess the requisite awareness of the biasing
mechanisms operating to produce their self-deceptive belief. Lacking
such awareness, self-deceivers do not appear to know when or on which
beliefs such mechanisms operate, rendering them unable to curb the
effects of these mechanisms, even when they operate to form false
beliefs about morally significant matters. Levy also argues that if
self-deceivers typically lack the control necessary for moral
responsibility in individual episodes of self-deception, they also
lack control over being the sort of person disposed to
self-deception.</p>

<p>
Non-intentionalists may respond by claiming that self-deceivers often
are aware of the potentially biasing effects their desires and
emotions might have and can exercise control over them (DeWeese-Boyd
2007). They might also challenge the idea the self-deceivers must be
aware in the ways Levy suggests. One well known account of control,
employed by Levy, holds that a person is responsible just in case she
acts on a mechanism that is moderately responsive to reasons
(including moral reasons), such that were she to possess such reasons
this same mechanism would act upon those reasons in at least one
possible world (Fischer and Ravizza 1999). Guidance control, in this
sense, requires that the mechanism in question be capable of
recognizing and responding to moral and non-moral reasons sufficient
for acting otherwise. In cases of self-deception, deflationary views
may suggest that the biasing mechanism, while sensitive and responsive
to motivation, is too simple to itself be responsive to reasons.
Nelkin (2011, 2012) argues for understanding reasons responsiveness to
apply to the <em>agent</em>, not the mechanism, requiring that
agent&rsquo;s have the capacity to exercise reason in the situation
under scrutiny. Accordingly, the question isn&rsquo;t whether the
biasing mechanism itself is reasons responsive but whether the agent
governing its operation is, that is, whether self-deceivers typically
could recognize and respond to moral and non-moral reasons to resist
the influence of their desires and emotions and instead exercise
special scrutiny of the belief in question. According to Nelkin
(2012), expecting self-deceivers to have such a capacity is more
likely if we understand the desire driving their bias a desire to
<em>believe</em> that <em>p</em>, since awareness of this sort of
desire would make it easier to guard against its influence on the
process of determining whether <em>p</em>. In view of these
considerations, it is plausible that self-deceivers have the requisite
control for moral responsibility on deflationary approaches, and
certainly not obvious that they lack it.</p>

<p>
Insofar as it seems plausible that in some cases self-deceivers are
apt targets for censure, what prompts this attitude? Take the case of
a mother who deceives herself into believing her husband is not
abusing their daughter because she can&rsquo;t bear the thought that he
is a moral monster (Barnes 1997). Why do we blame her? Here we
confront the nexus between moral responsibility for self-deception and
the morality of self-deception. Understanding what obligations may be
involved and breached in cases of this sort will help to clarify the
circumstances in which ascriptions of responsibility are
appropriate.</p>

<h3><a name="TheMorSelDec">5.2 The Morality of Self-Deception</a></h3>

<p>
While some instances of self-deception seem morally innocuous and
others may even be thought salutary in various ways (Rorty 1994), the
majority of theorists have thought there to be something morally
objectionable about self-deception or its consequences in many cases.
Self-deception has been considered objectionable because it
facilitates harm to others (Linehan 1982) and to oneself, undermines
autonomy (Darwall 1988; Baron 1988), corrupts conscience (Butler
1722), violates authenticity (Sartre 1943), manifests a vicious lack
of courage and self-control that undermine the capacity for
compassionate action (Jenni 2003), violates an epistemic duty to
properly ground self-ascriptions (Fern&aacute;ndez 2013), or violates
a general duty to form beliefs that &ldquo;conform to the available
evidence&rdquo; (Nelkin 2012). Linehan (1982) argues that we have an
obligation to scrutinize the beliefs that guide our actions that is
proportionate to the harm to others such actions might involve. When
self-deceivers induce ignorance of moral obligations, of the
particular circumstances, of likely consequences of actions, or of
their own engagements, by means of their self-deceptive beliefs, they
may be culpable. They are guilty of negligence with respect to their
obligation to know the nature, circumstances, likely consequences and
so forth of their actions (Jenni 2003; see also Nelkin 2012).
Self-deception, accordingly, undermines or erodes agency by reducing
our capacity for self-scrutiny and change. (Baron 1988) If I am
self-deceived about actions or practices that harm others or myself,
my ability to take responsibility and change are also severely
restricted. Joseph Butler, in his well-known sermon &ldquo;On
Self-Deceit&rdquo;, emphasizes the ways in which self-deception about
one&rsquo;s moral character and conduct, &lsquo;self-ignorance&rsquo;
driven by inordinate &lsquo;self-love&rsquo;, not only facilitates
vicious actions but hinders the agent&rsquo;s ability to change by
obscuring them from view. Such ignorance, claims Butler,
&ldquo;undermines the whole principle of good &hellip; and corrupts
conscience, which is the guide of life&rdquo; (&ldquo;On
Self-Deceit&rdquo;). Existentialist philosophers such as Kierkegaard
and Sartre, in very different ways, viewed self-deception as a threat
to &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; insofar as self-deceivers fail to take
responsibility for themselves and their engagements past, present and
future. By alienating us from our own principles, self-deception may
also threaten moral integrity (Jenni 2003). Furthermore,
self-deception also manifests certain weakness of character that
dispose us to react to fear, anxiety, or the desire for pleasure in
ways that bias our belief acquisition and retention in ways that serve
these emotions and desires rather than accuracy. Such epistemic
cowardice and lack of self-control may inhibit the ability of
self-deceivers to stand by or apply moral principles they hold by
biasing their beliefs regarding particular circumstances, consequences
or engagements, or by obscuring the principles themselves. In all
these ways and a myriad of others, philosophers have found some
self-deception objectionable in itself or for the consequences it has
on our ability to shape our lives.</p>

<p>
Those finding self-deception morally objectionable generally assume
that self-deception or, at least, the character that disposes us to
it, is under our control to some degree. This assumption need not
entail that self-deception is intentional only that it is avoidable in
the sense that self-deceivers could recognize and respond to reasons
for resisting bias by exercising special scrutiny (see section 5.1).
It should be noted, however, that self-deception still poses a serious
worry even if one cannot avoid entering into it, since self-deceivers
may nevertheless have an obligation to overcome it. If exiting
self-deception is under the guidance control of self-deceivers, then
they might reasonably be blamed for persisting in their self-deceptive
beliefs when they regard matters of moral significance.</p>

<p>
But even if agents don&rsquo;t bear specific responsibility for their
being in that state, self-deception may nevertheless be morally
objectionable, destructive and dangerous. If radically deflationary
models of self-deception do turn out to imply that our own desires and
emotions, in collusion with social pressures toward bias, lead us to
hold self-deceptive beliefs and cultivate habits of self-deception of
which we are unaware and from which cannot reasonably be expected to
escape on our own, self-deception would still undermine autonomy,
manifest character defects, obscure us from our moral engagements and
the like. For these reasons, Rorty (1994) emphasizes the importance of
the company we keep. Our friends, since they may not share our desires
or emotions, are often in a better position to recognize our
self-deception than we are. With the help of such friends,
self-deceivers may, with luck, recognize and correct morally corrosive
self-deception.</p>

<p>
Evaluating self-deception and its consequences for ourselves and
others is a difficult task. It requires, among other things:
determining the degree of control self-deceivers have; what the
self-deception is about (Is it important morally or otherwise?); what
ends the self-deception serves (Does it serve mental health or as a
cover for moral wrongdoing?); how entrenched it is (Is it episodic or
habitual?); and, whether it is escapable (What means of correction are
available to the self-deceiver?). As Nelkin (2012) contends,
determining whether and to what degree self-deceivers are culpably
negligent will ultimately need to be determined on a case by case
basis in light of answers to such questions about the stakes at play
and the difficulty involved. Despite the difficulties involved in
assigning responsibility, this discussion indicates the wide variety
of serious moral problems associated with self-deception that account
in part for the attention that has been devoted to this phenomenon
from the very beginning, especially within the Christian tradition
(e.g., Dyke 1633; Butler 1726).</p>

<h2><a name="OriSelDec">6. Origin of Self-Deception: Adaptation or Spandrel</a></h2>

<p>
Quite aside from the doxastic, strategic and moral puzzles
self-deception raises, there is the evolutionary puzzle of it&rsquo;s
origin. Why do human beings have this capacity in the first place? Why
would natural selection allow a capacity to survive that undermines
the accurate representation of reality, especially, when inaccuracies
about individual ability or likely risk can lead to catastrophic
errors? </p>

<p>
Many argue that self-deceptively inflated views of ourselves, our
abilities, our prospects, our control, so-called &lsquo;positive
illusions&rsquo;, confer direct benefits in terms of psychological
wellbeing, physical health and social advancement that serve fitness
(Taylor and Brown, 1994; Taylor, 1989; McKay and Dennett, 2009). Just
because &lsquo;positive illusions&rsquo; make us &lsquo;feel
good,&rsquo; of course, it does not follow that they are adaptive.
From an evolutionary perspective, whether an organism &lsquo;feels
good&rsquo; or is &lsquo;happy&rsquo; is not significant unless it
enhances survival and reproduction. McKay and Dennett (2009) argue
that positive illusions are not only tolerable evolutionarily
speaking, they actually appear to directly contribute to fitness.
Overly positive beliefs about our abilities or chances for success
appear to make us more apt to exceed our abilities and achieve success
than more accurate beliefs would (Taylor and Brown 1994, Bandura
1989). According to Johnston and Fowler (2011), overconfidence is
&ldquo;advantageous, because it encourages individuals to claim
resources they could not otherwise win if it came to a conflict
(stronger but cautious rivals will sometime fail to make a claim, and
it keeps them from walking away from conflicts they would surely
win.&rdquo; Inflated attitudes regarding the personal qualities and
capacities of one&rsquo;s partners and children also would seem to enhance
fitness by facilitating the thriving of offspring (McKay and Dennett
2009). </p>

<p>
Alternatively, some argue that self-deception evolved to facilitate
interpersonal deception by eliminating the cues and cognitive load
that consciously lying produces and by mitigating retaliation should
the deceit become evident (von Hippel and Trivers 2011; Trivers 2011,
2000, 1991). On this view, the real gains associated with &lsquo;positive
illusions&rsquo; and other self-deceptions are byproducts that serve this
greater evolutionary end by enhancing self-deceiver&rsquo;s ability to
deceive. Von Hippel and Trivers (2011) contend that &ldquo;by
deceiving themselves about their own positive qualities and the
negative qualities of others, people are able to display greater
confidence than they might otherwise feel, thereby enabling them to
advance socially and materially.&rdquo; Critics have pointed to data
suggesting high self-deceivers are deemed less trustworthy than low
self-deceivers (McKay and Dennett 2011). Others have complained that
there is little data to support this hypothesis (Dunning 2011, Van
Leeuwen 2007a, 2013a). Some challenge this theory by noting that a
simple disregard for the truth would serve as well as self-deception
and have the advantage of retaining true representations (McKay and
Prelec 2011), or that often self-deceivers are the only one&rsquo;s
deceived (Van Leeuwen 2007a; Kahlil 2011). Van Leeuwen (2013a) raises
the concern that the wide variety of phenomena identified by this
theory as self-deception render the category so broad that it is
difficult to tell whether it is a unified phenomenon traceable to
particular mechanisms that could plausibly be sensitive to selection
pressures. </p>

<p>
In view of these shortcomings, Van Leeuwen (2007a) argues the capacity
for self-deception is not a product of evolution; it is a
<em>spandrel</em>&mdash;a byproduct of other aspects of our cognitive
architecture&mdash;not an adaptation, at least, not in the strong
sense of being positively selected. That leaves open the possibility
that this capacity has nevertheless been retained as a consequence of
its fitness value. Lopez and Fuxjager (2011) argue that the broad
research on the so called &ldquo;winner effect&rdquo;&mdash;the
increased probability to achieve victory in social or physical
conflicts following prior victories&mdash;lends support to the idea
that self-deception is at least weakly adaptive, since self-deception
in the form of positive illusions, like past wins, confers a fitness
advantage. Lamba and Nityananda (2014) test the theory that
self-deceived are better at deceiving others, specifically whether
overconfident individuals are overrated by others and underconfident
individuals, underrated. In their study, students in tutorials were
asked to predict their own performance on the next assignment as well
as that of each of their peers in the tutorial in terms of absolute
grade and relative rank. Comparing these predictions and the actual
grades given on the assignment suggests a strong positive relationship
between self-deception and deception. Those who self-deceptively rated
themselves higher were rated higher by their peers as well. These
findings lend suggestive support to the claim self-deception
facilitates other deception. While these studies certainly do not
supply all the data necessary to support the theory that the
propensity to self-deception should be viewed as adaptation, they do
suggest ways to test these evolutionary hypotheses by focusing upon
specific phenomena. Whether or not the psychological and social
benefits identified by these theories explain the evolutionary origins
of the capacity for self-deceit, they may well shed light on its
prevalence and persistence, as well as pointing to ways to identify
contexts in which this tendency presents high collective risk (Lamba
and Nityandanda 2014).</p>

<h2><a name="ColSelDec">7. Collective Self-Deception</a></h2>

<p>
Collective self-deception has received scant direct philosophical
attention as compared with its individual counterpart. Collective
self-deception might refer simply to a group of similarly
self-deceived individuals or to a group-entity, such as a corporation,
committee, jury or the like, that is self-deceived. These alternatives
reflect two basic perspectives social epistemologists have taken on
ascriptions of propositional attitudes to collectives. On the one
hand, such attributions might be taken <em>summatively</em> as simply
an indirect way of attributing those states to members of the
collective (Quinton 1975/1976). This summative understanding, then,
considers attitudes attributed to groups to be nothing more than
metaphors expressing the sum of the attitudes held by their members.
To say that students think tuition is too high is just a way of saying
that most students think so. On the other hand, such attributions
might be understood <em>non-summatively</em> as applying to collective
entities, themselves ontologically distinct from the members upon
which they depend. These so-called &lsquo;plural subjects&rsquo;
(Gilbert 1989, 1994, 2005) or &lsquo;social integrates&rsquo; (Pettit
2003), while supervening upon the individuals comprising them, may
well express attitudes that diverge from individual members. For
instance, saying NASA believed the O-rings on the space
shuttle&rsquo;s booster rockets to be safe need not imply that most or
all the members of this organizations personally held this belief only
that the institution itself did. The non-summative understanding,
then, considers collectives to be, like persons, apt targets for
attributions of propositional attitudes, and potentially of moral and
epistemic censure as well. Following this distinction, collective
self-deception may be understood in either a summative or
non-summative sense.</p>

<p>
In the summative sense, collective self-deception refers to
self-deceptive belief shared by a group of individuals, who each come
to hold the self-deceptive belief for similar reasons and by similar
means, varying according to the account of self-deception followed. We
might call this self-deception <em>across</em> a collective. In the
non-summative sense, the subject of collective self-deception is the
collective itself, not simply the individuals comprising it. The
following sections offer an overview of these forms of collective
self-deception, noting the significant challenges posed by each.</p>

<h3><a name="SumColSelDecSelDecAcrCol">7.1 Summative Collective Self-Deception: Self-Deception Across a Collective</a></h3>

<p>
Understood summatively, we might define collective self-deception as
the holding of a false belief in the face of evidence to the contrary
by a group of people as a result of shared desires, emotions, or
intentions (depending upon the account of self-deception) favoring
that belief. Collective self-deception is distinct from other forms of
collective false belief&mdash;such as might result from deception or
lack of evidence&mdash;insofar as the false belief issues from the
agents&rsquo; own self-deceptive mechanisms (however these are
construed), not the absence of evidence to the contrary or presence of
misinformation. Accordingly, the individuals constituting the group
would not hold the false belief if their vision weren&rsquo;t
distorted by their attitudes (desire, anxiety, fear or the like)
toward the belief. What distinguishes collective self-deception from
solitary self-deception just is its social context, namely, that it
occurs within a group that shares both the attitudes bringing about
the false belief and the false belief itself. Compared to its solitary
counterpart, self-deception within a collective is both easier to
foster and more difficult to escape, being abetted by the
self-deceptive efforts of others within the group.</p>

<p>
Virtually all self-deception has a social component, being wittingly
or unwittingly supported by one's associates (See Ruddick 1988). In
the case of collective self-deception, however, the social dimension
comes to the fore, since each member of the collective unwittingly
helps to sustain the self-deceptive belief of the others in the group.
For example, my cancer stricken friend might self-deceptively believe
her prognosis to be quite good. Faced with the fearful prospect of
death, she does not form accurate beliefs regarding the probability of
her full recovery, attending only to evidence supporting full recovery
and discounting or ignoring altogether the ample evidence to the
contrary. Caring for her as I do, I share many of the anxieties, fears
and desires that sustain my friend&rsquo;s self-deceptive belief, and
as a consequence I form the same self-deceptive belief via the same
mechanisms. In such a case, I unwittingly support my friend&rsquo;s
self-deceptive belief and she mine&mdash;our self-deceptions are
mutually reinforcing. We are collectively or mutually self-deceived,
albeit on a very small scale. Ruddick (1988) calls this &lsquo;joint
self-deception.&rsquo;</p>

<p>
On a larger-scale, sharing common attitudes, large segments of a
society might deceive themselves together. For example, we share a
number of self-deceptive beliefs regarding our consumption patterns.
Many of the goods we consume are produced by people enduring labor
conditions we do not find acceptable and in ways that we recognize are
environmentally destructive and likely unsustainable. Despite our
being at least generally aware of these social and environmental
ramifications of our consumptive practices, we hold the overly
optimistic beliefs that the world will be fine, that its peril is
overstated, that the suffering caused by the exploitive and
ecologically degrading practices are overblown, that our own
consumption habits are unconnected to these sufferings anyway, even
that our minimal efforts at conscientious consumption are an adequate
remedy (See, Goleman 1989). When self-deceptive beliefs such as these
are held collectively, they become entrenched and their consequences,
good or bad, are magnified (Surbey 2004).</p>

<p>
The collective entrenches self-deceptive beliefs by providing positive
reinforcement by others sharing the same false belief, as well as
protection from evidence that would destabilize the target belief.
There are, however, limits to how entrenched such beliefs can become
and remain self-deceptive. The social support cannot be the sole or
primary cause of the self-deceptive belief, for then the belief would
simply be the result of unwitting interpersonal deception and not the
deviant belief formation process that characterizes self-deception. If
the environment becomes so epistemically contaminated as to make
counter-evidence inaccessible to the agent, then we have a case of
false belief, not self-deception. Thus, even within a collective a
person is self-deceived just in case she would not hold her false
belief if she did not possess the motivations skewing her belief
formation process. This said, relative to solitary self-deception, the
collective variety does present greater external obstacles to avoiding
or escaping self-deception, and is for this reason more entrenched. If
the various proposed psychological mechanisms of self-deception pose
an internal challenge to the self-deceiver&rsquo;s power to control
her belief formation, then these social factors pose an external
challenge to the self-deceiver&rsquo;s control. Determining the how
superable this challenge is will affect our assessment of individual
responsibility for self-deception as well as the prospects of
unassisted escape from it.</p>

<h3><a name="NonSumColSelDecSelDecColEnt">7.2 Non-summative Collective Self-Deception: Self-Deception of a Collective Entity</a></h3>

<p>
Collective self-deception can also be understood from the perspective
of the collective itself in a non-summative sense. Though there are
varying accounts of group belief, generally speaking, a group can be
said to believe, desire, value or the like just in case its members
&ldquo;jointly commit&rdquo; to these things as a body (Gilbert 2005).
A corporate board, for instance, might be jointly committed as a body
to believe, value and strive for whatever the CEO recommends. Such
commitment need not entail that each individual board member
personally endorses such beliefs, values or goals, only that as
members of the board they do (Gilbert 2005). While philosophically
precise accounts of non-summative self-deception remain largely
unarticulated, the possibilities mirror those of individual
self-deception. When collectively held attitudes motivate a group to
espouse a false belief despite the group&rsquo;s possession of
evidence to the contrary, we can say that the group is collectively
self-deceived in a non-summative sense.</p>

<p>
For example, Robert Trivers (2000) suggests that &lsquo;organizational
self-deception&rsquo; led to NASA&rsquo;s failure to represent
accurately the risks posed by the space shuttle&rsquo;s O-ring design,
a failure that eventually led to the Challenger disaster. The
organization as a whole, he argues, had strong incentives to represent
such risks as small. As a consequence, NASA&rsquo;s Safety Unit
mishandled and misrepresented data it possessed that suggested that
under certain temperature conditions the shuttle&rsquo;s O-rings were
not safe. NASA, as an organization, then, self-deceptively believed
the risks posed by O-ring damage were minimal. Within the institution,
however, there were a number of individuals who did not share this
belief, but both they and the evidence supporting their belief were
treated in a bias manner by the decision-makers within the
organization. As Trivers (2000) puts it, this information was
relegated &ldquo;to portions of &hellip; the organization that [were]
inaccessible to consciousness (we can think of the people running NASA
as the conscious part of the organization).&rdquo; In this case,
collectively held values created a climate within NASA that clouded
its vision of the data and led to its endorsement of a fatally false
belief.</p>

<p>
Collective self-deceit may also play a significant role in
facilitating unethical practices by corporate entities. For example, a
collective commitment by members of a corporation to maximizing
profits might lead members to form false beliefs about the ethical
propriety of the corporation&rsquo;s practices. Gilbert (2005)
suggests that such a commitment might lead executives and other
members to &ldquo;simply lose sight of moral constraints and values
they previously held&rdquo;. Similarly, Tenbrunsel and Messick (2004)
argue that self-deceptive mechanisms play a pervasive role in what
they call &lsquo;ethical fading&rsquo;, acting as a kind of
&lsquo;bleach&rsquo; that renders organizations blind to the ethical
dimensions of their decisions. They argue that such self-deceptive
mechanisms must be recognized and actively resisted at the
organizational level if unethical behavior is to be avoided. More
specifically, Gilbert (2005) contends that collectively accepting that
&ldquo;certain moral constraints must rein in the pursuit of corporate
profits&rdquo; might shift corporate culture in such a way that
efforts to respect these constraints are recognized as part of being a
good corporate citizen. In view of the ramifications this sort of
collective self-deception has for the way we understand corporate
misconduct and responsibility, understanding its specific nature in
greater detail remains an important task.</p>

<p>
Collective self-deception understood in either the summative or
non-summative sense raises a number of significant questions such as
whether individuals within collectives bear responsibility for their
self-deception or the part they play in the collective&rsquo;s
self-deception, and whether collective entities can be held
responsible for their epistemic failures. Finally, collective
self-deception prompts us to ask what means are available collectives
and their members to resist, avoid and escape self-deception. To
answer these and other questions, more precise accounts of these forms
of self-deception are needed. Given the capacity of collective
self-deception to entrench false beliefs and to magnify their
consequences&mdash;sometimes with disastrous results&mdash;collective
self-deception is not just a philosophical puzzle; it is a problem
that demands attention.</p>

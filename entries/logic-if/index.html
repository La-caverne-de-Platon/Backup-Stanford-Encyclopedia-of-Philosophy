<div id="preamble">

<p>
Independence friendly logic (IF logic, IF first-order logic) is an
extension of first-order logic. In it, more quantifier dependencies
and independencies can be expressed than in first-order logic. Its
quantifiers range over individuals only; semantically IF first-order
logic, however, has the same expressive power as existential
second-order logic. IF logic lacks certain metaproperties that
first-order logic has (axiomatizability, Tarski-type semantics). On
the other hand, IF logic admits a self-applied truth-predicate &ndash;
a property that first-order logic notoriously does not enjoy.
Philosophical issues discussed in connection with IF logic include
reformulating the logicist program, the question of truth in axiomatic
set theory, and the nature of negation. Work in IF logic has also
inspired alternative generalizations of first-order logic: slash logic
and

<h2><a name="IntQuaDep">1. Introduction: Quantifier Dependence</a></h2>

<p>
In mathematical prose, one can say things such as &lsquo;for all real
numbers \(a\) and for all positive real numbers \(\varepsilon\), there
exists a positive real number \(\delta\) depending on \(\varepsilon\)
but not on \(a\), such that&hellip;&rsquo; What is important here is
quantifier dependence. The existential quantifier &lsquo;there exists
\(\delta\)&rsquo; is said to depend on the universal quantifier
&lsquo;for all \(\varepsilon\)&rsquo; but not on the universal
quantifier &lsquo;for all \(a\).&rsquo; It was an essential part of
Karl Weierstrass&rsquo;s (1815&ndash;1897) work in the foundations of
analysis that he defined the notions of limit, continuity, and
derivative in terms of quantifier
 dependence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup> For
 a concrete example, a function \(f : D \rightarrow \mathbf{R}\)
is <em>continuous</em>, if for all \(a\) in the set \(D\) and for all
\(\varepsilon \gt 0\) there exists \(\delta \gt 0\) such that for all
\(x\) in \(D\), if \(|x - a| \lt \delta\), then \(|f(x) - f(a)| \lt \varepsilon\). The definition of <em>uniform
continuity</em> is obtained from that of continuity by specifying that
the quantifer &lsquo;there exists \(\delta\)&rsquo; depends only on
the quantifier &lsquo;for all \(\varepsilon\),&rsquo; not on the
quantifier &lsquo;for all \(a\).&rsquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
<em>Independence friendly first-order logic</em> (a.k.a. <em>IF
first-order logic</em>, <em>IF logic</em>) was introduced by Jaakko
Hintikka and Gabriel Sandu in their article &lsquo;Informational
Independence as a Semantical Phenomenon&rsquo; (1989); other early
sources are Hintikka&rsquo;s booklet <em>Defining Truth, the Whole
Truth, and Nothing but the Truth</em> (1991) and Sandu&rsquo;s Ph.D.
thesis
 (1991).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 IF first-order logic is an extension of first-order logic, involving
a specific syntactic device &lsquo;/&rsquo; (slash, independence
indicator), which has at the object language level the same effect as
the meta-level modifier &lsquo;but does not depend on&rsquo; has in
the example just considered. In the notation of IF logic, the logical
form of the statement that a function \(f\) is uniformly
continuous would be
\((\forall a)(\forall \varepsilon)(\exists \delta /\forall a)(\forall x)
R\), to be contrasted with the form of the statement that
\(f\) merely is continuous,
\((\forall a)(\forall \varepsilon)(\exists \delta)(\forall x)
R\).</p>

<p> If in a first-order sentence an existential quantifier \(\exists
y\) lies in the syntactic scope of a universal quantifier \(\forall
x\), then by the semantics \(\exists y\) automatically depends on
\(\forall x\). This is so <em>e.g.</em> with the sentence \((\forall
x)(\exists y) R(x, y)\). The dependence of \(\exists y\) on \(\forall
x\) means that the <em>witness</em> of \(\exists y\) may vary with the
value interpreting \(\forall x\). It suffices that there be a function
\(f\) such that \(R(a, f(a))\) holds in \(M\), for any \(a\)
interpreting \(\forall x\). Such functions, spelling out the
dependencies of witnesses for existential quantifiers on
interpretations of universal quantifiers, are known in logical
literature as <em>Skolem
 functions</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 For comparison, in the sentence \((\exists y)(\forall x) R(x, y)\)
the quantifier \(\exists y\) does not depend on the quantifier
\(\forall x.\) One and the same witness \(c\) for \(\exists y\) must
be good against any interpretation \(a\) of \(\forall x\), so that
\(R(a, c)\) holds in \(M\). The corresponding Skolem function is a
 constant.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup></p>
 

<p>
In IF first-order logic, syntactic scopes no longer determine the
semantic relation of dependence. In the formula \((\forall x)(\forall
y)(\exists z/\forall y) R(x, y, z)\), for instance, \(\exists z\) is
syntactically subordinate to both \(\forall x\) and \(\forall y\), but
is marked as independent of \(\forall y\), and is hence dependent only
on \(\forall x\). Semantically this means that the witness of
\(\exists z\) must be given by a function taking as an argument the
interpretation of \(\forall x\), but not that of \(\forall y\). In
order for \((\forall x)(\forall y)(\exists z/\forall y) R(x, y, z)\)
to be true in \(M\), there must be a function \(f\) of one argument
such that \(R(a, b, f(a))\) holds in \(M\), for any \(a\) interpreting
\(\forall x\) and any \(b\) interpreting \(\forall y\).</p>

<p>
What is gained with the slash notation? After all, clearly <em>e.g.</em>
\((\forall x)(\forall y)(\exists z/\forall y)
R(x, y, z)\) is true in a model
\(M\)
 iff<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 the first-order sentence
\((\forall x)(\exists z)(\forall y)
R(x, y, z)\) is true therein. As a
matter of fact, the expressive power of IF logic exceeds that of
first-order logic. Consider the sentence
\((\forall x)(\exists y)(\forall z)(\exists w/\forall x)
R(x, y, z, w)\). Its
truth-condition is of the following form: there are one-argument
functions \(f\) and \(g\) such that \(R(a,
f(a), b, g(b))\) holds in
\(M\), for any \(a\) interpreting \(\forall x\) and
\(b\) interpreting
 \(\forall z\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 So the sentence is true iff the following sentence (*) containing a
<em>finite partially ordered quantifier</em> is true:</p>

\[\tag{*}
\begin{matrix}
\forall x \exists y \\
\forall z \exists w
\end{matrix}
R(x,y,z,w)
\]

<p>
For, by definition (*) is true in a model \(M\) iff the second-order
sentence \((\exists f)(\exists g)(\forall x)(\forall z) R(x, f(x), z,
g(z))\) is true therein. The latter may be termed the
<em>Skolem normal form</em> of (*). It says that Skolem functions
providing witnesses for the quantifiers \(\exists y\) and
\(\exists w\) in (*) exist. Finite partially ordered quantifiers
&ndash; a.k.a. <em>Henkin quantifiers</em> or <em>branching
quantifiers</em> &ndash; were proposed by Leon Henkin (1961) and have
been subsequently studied
 extensively.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 They are two-dimensional syntactic objects</p>

\[\begin{matrix}
Q_{11} \ldots Q_{1n} \\
\vdots \\
Q_{m1} \ldots Q_{mn}
\end{matrix}\]

<p>
where each \(Q_{ij}\) is either \(\exists x_{ij}\) or \(\forall
x_{ij}\). They are naturally interpreted by making systematic use of
Skolem functions.</p>

<p>
Let us denote by \(\mathbf{FPO}\) the logic of finite partially
ordered quantifiers obtained from first-order logic as follows: if
\(\phi\) is a first-order formula and \(\mathbf{Q}\) is a finite
partially ordered quantifier, then \(\mathbf{Q}\phi\) is a
formula of
 \(\mathbf{FPO}\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 With \(\mathbf{FPO}\) it is possible to express properties that
are not definable in first-order logic. The first example was provided
by Andrzej Ehrenfeucht (cf. Henkin 1961): a sentence that is true in a
model iff the size of its domain is infinite. It turns out that
\(\mathbf{FPO}\) can be translated into IF logic (see
<em>Subsect</em>. 4.1). Therefore IF logic is more expressive than
first-order logic.</p>

<p>
The deepest reason for IF logic, as Hintikka sees it, is that the
relations of dependence and independece between <em>quantifiers</em>
are the only way of expressing relations of dependence and independece
between <em>variables</em> on the first-order level (Hintikka 1996:
34&ndash;35, 73&ndash;74; 2002a: 404&ndash;405; 2006a: 71, 515). To
understand this remark properly, recall that relations of quantifier
(in)dependence are <em>semantic</em> relations, but <em>syntactically
expressed</em>. More precisely, in IF logic the (in)dependence
relations are syntactically expressed by the interplay of two factors:
syntactic scope and the independence indicator &lsquo;/&rsquo;. In a
given sentence, an existential quantifier \(\exists x\), say,
depends on precisely those universal quantifiers within whose scope
\(\exists x\) lies, but of which \(\exists x\) is not marked
as independent using the slash sign. What Hintikka means when he
speaks of (in)dependence relations between variables, are
<em>functional dependencies</em> between quantities in a model. The
kinetic energy of a material body depends on its mass and its speed,
but does not depend on the particular material body being considered.
This fact can be expressed in IF logic by the sentence</p>

<p class="indent">
\((\forall b)(\forall m)(\forall v)(\exists e/\forall b)\)(if
\(b\) is a material body which moves at the velocity \(v\)
and has the mass \(m\), then the kinetic energy \(e\) of
\(b\) equals \(\frac{1}{2} mv^2 )\).
</p>

<p>
That this sentence states the existence of a functional dependence of
kinetic energy on mass and speed is particularly clearly seen from the
fact that if the sentence is true, the unique Skolem function for the
quantifier \(\exists e\) actually <em>is</em> the physical law
connecting masses, speeds and kinetic energies (cf. Hintikka 1996:
34&ndash;35).</p>

<p>
While first-order logic can only express some relations between
variables, IF first-order logic with its greater expressive power can
express more. Actually, IF logic is calculated to capture all such
relations (Hintikka 1996: 75&ndash;77; 2002a: 404&ndash;405; 2002b:
197; 2006a: 72). This idea must, in its full generality, be seen as
programmatic. For a more general framework, cf. Hintikka (2006a: 515,
536, 752; 2008), Sandu &amp; Sevenster (2010), Sandu (2013).</p>

<p>
Among philosophical issues that have been addressed in connection with
IF logic are the reconstruction of mathematical reasoning on the
first-order level (Hintikka 1996, 1997), definability of a
self-applied truth predicate (Hintikka 1991, 1996, 2001; Sandu 1998),
truth and axiomatic set theory (Hintikka 1996, 2004a), and insights
into the nature of negation (Hintikka 1991, 1996, 2002; Hintikka &amp;
Sandu 1989; Sandu 1994). These issues will be discussed in
<em>Sections</em> 4 and 5.</p>

<h2><a name="BacIFLogGamTheSem">2. The Background of IF Logic: Game-theoretical Semantics</a></h2>

<h3><a name="SemGam">2.1. Semantic games</a></h3>

<p>
Inspired by Ludwig Wittgenstein&rsquo;s idea of a language-game,
Hintikka (1968) introduced the basic framework of what came to be
known as <em>game-theoretical semantics</em> (a.k.a. GTS). The basic
lesson Hintikka adopts from Wittgenstein is that words &ndash; in
particular quantifiers &ndash; are associated with activities that
render them meaningful: words often have meaning only in the context
of certain types of action (Hintikka 1968: 55&ndash;56). Wittgenstein
said that by &lsquo;language-game&rsquo; he means &lsquo;the whole,
consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven&rsquo;
(Wittgenstein 1953: I, <em>Sect.</em> 7).</p>

<p>
It becomes natural to ask which are the activities that go together
with quantifiers. As Hintikka explains (see Hintikka 2006a: 41, 67),
Wittgenstein had taken it as a criterion for something to be an object
that it can be looked for and found. Applying this idea to quantifiers
with such objects as values, Hintikka was led to formulate
<em>semantic games</em> for quantifiers. Crucially, these semantic
games can be formulated as games in the strict sense of game theory;
but at the same time they are exact codifications of language-games in
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s sense, at least if one accepts that the
activities associated with quantifiers are &lsquo;looking for&rsquo;
and
 &lsquo;finding.&rsquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Semantic games \(G(\phi , M)\) for first-order sentences \(\phi\) are
two-player zero-sum games of perfect information, played on a given
model \(M\). Let us call the two players simply player 1 and player
 2.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup> 
 The games
are most easily explained for sentences in prenex normal form: a
string of quantifiers followed by a quantifier-free first-order
formula. Universal quantifiers mark a move of player 1, while
existential quantifiers prompt a move by player 2. In both cases, the
relevant player must choose an individual from the domain \(\rM\) of
 \(M\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup> If</p>

\[
\phi = (\forall x)(\exists y)(\forall z)(\exists w) R(x, y, z, w),
\]

<p>
the game is played as follows. First, player 1 picks out an individual
\(a\), whereafter player 2 chooses an individual \(b\). Then player 1
proceeds to choose a further individual \(c\), to which player 2
responds by picking out an individual \(d\). Thereby a play of the
game has come to an end. The tuple \((a, b, c, d)\) of individuals
chosen determines the winner of the play. If the quantifier-free
formula \(R(a, b, c, d)\) holds in \(M\), player 2 wins, if not,
player 1 wins.</p>

<p>
The fact that one of the players wins a single play of game \(G(\phi ,
M)\) does not yet tell us anything about the truth-value of the
sentence \(\phi\). Truth and falsity are characterized in terms of the
notion of <em>winning strategy</em>. The sentence \((\forall
x)(\exists y)(\forall z)(\exists w) R(x, y, z, w)\) is
<em>true</em> in \(M\) if there is a winning strategy for player
2 in the game just described: a recipe telling player 2 what to do,
when (a specified amount of) information about the opponent&rsquo;s
earlier moves is given. Technically, the requirement is that there be
<em>strategy functions</em> \(f\) and \(g\), such that for
any choices \(a\) and \(c\) by player \(1,
R(a, f(a), c, g(a, c))\) holds in \(M\). Observe that
strategy function \(f\) is a Skolem function for the quantifier
\(\exists y\) in \(\phi\), and similarly \(g\) is a Skolem
function for the quantifier \(\exists w\). The sentence \(\phi\) is
<em>false</em> in \(M\) if there is a winning strategy (set of
strategy functions) for player 1 in the corresponding game: a constant
\(c\) and a function \(h\) such that for any choices \(b\) and \(d\)
by player \(2, R(c, b, h(b), d)\) fails to hold in \(M\).</p>

<p>
Game-theoretical interpretaton of quantifiers was already suggested by
Henkin (1961; cf. Hintikka 1968: 64). Henkin also pointed out, in
effect, the connection between a full set of Skolem functions and a
winning strategy for player 2. Hintikka (1968) noted that conjunctions
are naturally interpreted by a choice between the two conjuncts, made
by player 1; similarly, disjunctions can be interpreted by a choice by
player 2 between the two
 disjuncts.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 Further, Hintikka proposed to interpret negation as a transposition
of the roles of &lsquo;verifier&rsquo; and &lsquo;falsifier&rsquo;
(for more details, see <em>Subsect.</em> 3.2). </p>

<p>
The game-theoretical description of semantic games does not mention
the activities of searching and finding; for such an abstract
description it suffices to speak of the players making a move. Also,
the characterization of truth and falsity as the existence of a
winning strategy for player 2 and player 1, respectively, does not
refer to efforts on the part of the players &ndash; say efforts to
establish truth or to find witnesses. The truth or falsity of a
sentence is a matter of &lsquo;combinatorics&rsquo;: it is an issue of
the existence of a set of functions with certain properties (cf.
Hintikka 1968, 1996; Hodges 2013). So what happened to the original
philosophical conception according to which the meanings of
quantifiers are tied to the activities of searching and finding?
Hintikka&rsquo;s idea is that asserting a sentence involving
quantifiers is to make a claim about what can and what cannot happen
when a certain language-game is played; using language involving
quantifiers requires mastering the rules of the corresponding semantic
games (Hintikka 1968: <em>Sect.</em> 8, 1996: 128, 2006a: 538). What
is the content of such a claim in connection with the sentence
\(\forall x\exists y R(x, y)\)? That whichever individual player 1
chooses from the domain for \(\forall x\), player 2 can find a witness
individual for \(\exists y\). In other words, given a value for
\(\forall x\) (which itself can be seen as the result of the search by
player 1), if player 2 is allowed to search free from any practical
constraints, she will find a value for \(\exists y\) so that player 2
wins the resulting play. Even though semantic games themselves can be
defined without recourse to activities such as looking for or finding,
these activities play an important conceptual role when the language
user reasons <em>about</em> these games.</p>

<p>
Hintikka (1973a) initiated the application of GTS to the study of
natural language. This work was continued notably by Hintikka &amp;
Kulas (1983, 1985), where game-theoretical rules for such items as
negation, anaphoric pronouns, genitives, tenses, intensional verbs,
certain prepositional constructions, and proper names were given, and
the distinction between abstract meaning and strategic meaning
 drawn.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<h3><a name="ImpInf">2.2. Imperfect information</a></h3>

<p>
The framework of GTS enables asking questions of a game-theoretical
nature about semantic evaluation. Hintikka (1973a) observed that
semantic games with imperfect information are devised without any
difficulty. As logical examples he used \(\mathbf{FPO}\)
sentences. (For examples related to natural languages, see
<em>Subsect</em>. 5.4.)</p>

<p>
From the vantage point of GTS, independence friendly first-order logic
differs from first-order logic in that semantic games correlated with
formulas of the former are, in general, games of imperfect
information, while any game associated with a first-order formula is a
game of perfect information. Consider the game for \(\forall x\exists
y\forall z(\exists w/\forall x) R(x, y, z, w)\), played on a model
\(M\). A play of this game proceeds exactly as plays of the game
corresponding to \(\forall x\exists y\forall z\exists w R(x, y, z,
w)\). First, player 1 chooses an individual \(a\), whereafter player 2
chooses an individual \(b\). Then player 1 proceeds to pick out a
further individual \(c\), to which player 2 responds by choosing an
individual \(d\). So a play of the game has come to an end. The play
is won by player 2, if indeed \(R(a, b,c, d)\) holds in \(M\);
otherwise it is won by player 1. But \(\exists w\) was marked as
independent of \(\forall x\) &ndash; why does not this fact show in
any way in the course of a play?</p>

<p>
One might be tempted to add to the description of a play:
&lsquo;player 2 chooses a value for \(\exists w\) in ignorance of the
value for \(\forall x\).&rsquo; However, such a paraphrase would not
clarify the conceptual situation. It makes no sense to speak of the
independence of a move from other given moves by reference to a single
play; this can only be done by reference to a multitude of
plays. Quantifier independence can be conceptualized in
game-theoretical terms making use of the notion of <em>strategy</em>.
In the example, a strategy of player 2 is a set \(\{f, g\}\) of
strategy functions, function \(f\) providing a value for \(\exists y\)
depending on the value of \(\forall x\), and function \(g\) providing
a value for \(\exists w\) depending on the value chosen for \(\forall
z\) but not on the value chosen for \(\forall x\). The strategy \(\{f,
g\}\) is, then, a winning strategy for player 2, iff \(R(a, f(a), c,
g(c))\) holds in \(M\), for all values \(a\) chosen for \(\forall x\)
and \(c\) chosen for \(\forall z\). One precise way of implementing
the idea that player 2 is &lsquo;ignorant&rsquo; of the move player 1
made for \(\forall x\) is to say that <strong>(a)</strong> strategy
functions always only take as arguments the opponent&rsquo;s moves,
and <strong>(b)</strong> the strategy function corresponding to
\(\exists w\) may not take as its argument the move player 1 made for
\(\forall x\).</p>

<p>
A sentence of IF first-order logic is by definition true in a model
\(M\) iff there is a winning strategy for player 2 in the
correlated game, and false iff there is a winning strategy for player
1 in the correlated game. There are sentences which under these
criteria are neither true nor false; they are called
<em>non-determined</em> (see <em>Subsect.</em> 3.3).</p>

<p>
In Hintikka&rsquo;s judgement, the game-theoretical semantics of
quantifiers can be taken to have the same rationale that was mentioned
as the deepest reason for IF first-order logic at the end of
<em>Section</em> 1: GTS is a method of representing, on the
first-order level, the (in)dependence relations between variables by
means of informational (in)dependence in the sense of game theory
(Hintikka 1991: 12&ndash;13, 2006a: 535).</p>

<h2><a name="SynSemIFFirOrdLog">3. The Syntax and Semantics of IF First-order Logic</a></h2>

<p>
In the literature one can find essentially different formulations of
&lsquo;IF first-order logic.&rsquo; The differences are not restricted
to syntax &ndash; examples of applying different semantic ideas can be
found as well. </p>

<p>
As already noted, there is a systematic connection between the Skolem
functions and strategy functions of player 2. A Skolem function for an
existential quantifier is a function of the values assigned to the
preceding <em>universal</em> quantifiers, but <em>not</em> a function
of the values assigned to the preceding existential
 quantifiers.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 Skolem functions are strategy functions taking as arguments
exclusively moves made by player 1. Generally a strategy for a player
in a two-player game <em>can</em> perfectly well make use of the
previous choices of either player. Hodges (2007) stresses that it
makes a difference on which notion &ndash; Skolem function or strategy
function &ndash; the semantics of imperfect information is based.
Hodges (1997a) adopted the notational convention of writing, say,
\((\exists y/x)\) where Hintikka writes
\((\exists y/\forall x)\), hence marking the difference
between semantic games formulated in terms of arbitrary strategy
functions and those whose strategy functions are in effect Skolem
functions; the variable \(x\) in \((\exists y/x)\)
can be &lsquo;bound&rsquo; by any syntactically preceding quantifier
carrying the variable \(x\). Hodges proposed to employ the former
formulation, while in Hintikka (1991, 1995, 1996, 2002) and Sandu
(1993, 1994) the latter formulation is employed. Hodges (2007: 119)
writes:</p>

<blockquote>
[W]e refer to the logic with my notation and the general game
semantics as <em>slash logic</em>. During recent years many writers in
this area (but never Hintikka himself) have transferred the name
&lsquo;IF logic&rsquo; to slash logic, often without realising the
difference. Until the terminology settles down, we have to beware of
examples and proofs that don&rsquo;t make clear which semantics they
intend.
</blockquote>

<p>
The distinction that Hodges makes between slash logic and IF logic
serves to bring order to the mishmash of different formulations of IF
first-order logic to be found in the
 literature.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup></p>
 

<h3><a name="Syn">3.1. Syntax</a></h3>

<p>
IF first-order logic is an extension of first-order logic. Now, any
first-order formula is equivalent to a first-order formula in which no
variable occurs both free and bound, and in which no two nested
quantifiers carry the same variable. Formulas meeting these two
syntactic conditions will be termed <em>regular</em>. Henceforth we
systematically restrict attention to regular first-order
 formulas.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup>
 A <em>vocabulary</em> (signature, non-logical terminology) is any
countable set \(\tau\) of relation symbols (each of which carries a fixed
arity), function symbols (again each with a fixed arity), and constant
symbols. The first-order logic of vocabulary \(\tau\) will be referred to
as \(\mathbf{FO}[\tau]\). A formula of \(\mathbf{FO}[\tau]\)
is in <em>negation normal form</em>, if all occurrences of the
negation symbol \({\sim}\) immediately precede an atomic formula. The set of
<em>formulas</em> of IF first-order logic of vocabulary \(\tau\) (or
\(\mathbf{IFL}[\tau])\) can be defined as the smallest set such
that:</p>

<ol>

<li>If \(\phi\) is a formula of \(\mathbf{FO}[\tau]\) in negation
normal form, \(\phi\) is a formula.</li>

<li>If \(\phi\) is a formula and in \(\phi\) a token of \((\exists
x)\) occurs in the syntactic scope of a number of universal
quantifiers which include \((\forall y_1),\ldots ,(\forall y_n)\), the
result of replacing in \(\phi\) that token of \((\exists x)\) by
\((\exists x/\forall y_1 ,\ldots ,\forall y_n)\) is a formula.</li>

<li>If \(\phi\) is a formula and in \(\phi\) a token of \(\vee\)
occurs in the syntactic scope of a number of universal quantifiers
which include \((\forall y_1),\ldots ,(\forall y_n)\), the result of
replacing in \(\phi\) that token of \(\vee\) by \((\vee /\forall y_1
,\ldots ,\forall y_n)\) is a formula.</li>

<li>If \(\phi\) is a formula and in \(\phi\) a token of \((\forall
x)\) occurs in the syntactic scope of a number of existential
quantifiers which include \((\exists y_1),\ldots ,(\exists y_n)\), the
result of replacing in \(\phi\) that token of \((\forall x)\) by
\((\forall x/\exists y_1 ,\ldots ,\exists y_n)\) is a formula.</li>

<li>If \(\phi\) is a formula and in \(\phi\) a token of \(\wedge\)
occurs in the syntactic scope of a number of existential quantifiers
which include \((\exists y_1),\ldots ,(\exists y_n)\), the result of
replacing in \(\phi\) that token of \(\wedge\) by \((\wedge /\exists
y_1 ,\ldots ,\exists y_n)\) is a formula.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Clauses (2) and (3) allow the degenerate case that the list of
universal quantifiers is empty \((n = 0)\). The resulting expressions
\((\exists x\)/) and \((\vee\)/) are identified with the usual
existential quantifier \((\exists x)\) and the usual disjunction
\(\vee\), respectively. Similar stipulations are made about clauses
(4) and (5).</p>

<p>
In a suitable vocabulary, each of the following is a formula:</p>

<ul>

<li>
\((\forall x)(\forall y)(\exists z/\forall x) R(x, y, z, v)\), </li>

<li> \((\forall x)(\forall y)(P(x, y) \; (\vee /\forall x) \; Q(x,
y))\),</li>

<li> \((\exists x)(S(x) \; (\wedge /\exists x) \; T(x))\), </li>

<li>
\((\forall x)(\exists y)(\forall z/\exists y)(\exists v/\forall x)
R(x, y, z, v)\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
By contrast, none of the following sequences of symbols is a
formula:</p>

<ul>

<li> \((\exists y/\forall x) P(x, y)\), </li>

<li> \((\exists x)(\exists y/\exists x) P(x, y)\), </li>

<li> \((\forall x)(\forall y/\forall x) P(x, y)\), </li>

<li> \((\forall x)(S(x) \; (\vee /\exists y) \; T(x))\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
If \(\phi\) is an \(\mathbf{IFL}\) formula, generated by the above
clauses from some \(\mathbf{FO}\) formula \(\phi^*\), the <em>free
variables</em> of \(\phi\) are simply the free variables of
\(\phi^*\).  \(\mathbf{IFL}\) formulas without free variables are
\(\mathbf{IFL}\)
 <em>sentences</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup></p>
 

<h3><a name="Sem">3.2. Semantics</a></h3>

<p>
Defining the semantics of a logic using GTS is a two-step process. The
first step is to define the relevant <em>semantic games</em>. The
second step is to define the notions of &lsquo;true&rsquo; and
&lsquo;false&rsquo; in terms of the semantic games; this happens by
reference to the notion of <em>winning strategy</em>. Semantic games
may be defined by specifying recursively the alternative ways in which
a game associated with a given formula \(\phi\) can be
 begun.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
For every vocabulary \(\tau\), \(\mathbf{IFL}[\tau]\) formula \(\phi\),
model \((\tau\) structure) \(M\), and variable assignment \(g\), a
two-player zero-sum game \(G(\phi , M, g)\) between player 1 and
player 2 is 
 associated.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup> 
 If \(g\) is a variable assignment, \(g[x/a]\) is the variable
assignment which is otherwise like \(g\) but maps the variable \(x\)
to the object \(a\).</p>

<ol>

<li>If \(\phi = R(t_1 ,\ldots ,t_n)\) and \(M, g \vDash R(t_1 ,\ldots
,t_n)\), player 2 wins (and player 1 loses); otherwise player 1 wins
(and player 2 loses).</li>

<li>If \(\phi = {\sim}R(t_1 ,\ldots ,t_n)\) and \(M, g \not\vDash
R(t_1 ,\ldots ,t_n)\), player 2 wins (and player 1 loses); otherwise
player 1 wins (and player 2 loses).</li>

<li>If \(\phi = (\psi \; (\wedge /\exists y_1 ,\ldots ,\exists y_n) \;
\chi)\), player 1 chooses \(\theta \in \{\psi ,\chi \}\) and the rest
of the game is as in \(G(\theta , M, g)\).</li>

<li>If \(\phi = (\psi \; (\vee /\forall y_1 ,\ldots ,\forall y_n) \;
\chi)\), player 2 chooses \(\theta \in \{\psi ,\chi \}\) and the rest
of the game is as in \(G(\theta , M, g)\).</li>

<li>If \(\phi = (\forall x/\exists y_1 ,\ldots ,\exists y_n)\psi\),
player 1 chooses an element \(a\) from \(\rM\), and the rest of the game is
as in \(G(\psi , M, g[x/a]\)).</li>

<li>If \(\phi = (\exists x/\forall y_1 ,\ldots ,\forall y_n)\psi\),
player 2 chooses an element \(a\) from \(\rM\), and the rest of the game is
as in \(G(\psi , M, g[x/a]\)).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Observe that the independence indications play no role in the game
rules. Indeed, quantifier independence will be implemented on the
level of strategies. </p>

<p>
If a token of \((\vee /\forall y_1 ,\ldots ,\forall y_n)\) or
\((\exists x/\forall y_1 ,\ldots ,\forall y_n)\) appears in the
formula \(\phi\) in the scope of the universal quantifiers \(\forall
y_1 ,\ldots ,\forall y_n,\forall z_1 ,\ldots ,\forall z_m\) (and only
these universal quantifiers), a <em>strategy function</em> of player 2
for this token in game \(G(\phi , M, g)\) is any function \(f\)
satisfying the following:</p>

<p class="indent">
The arguments of \(f\) are the elements
\(a_1 ,\ldots ,a_m\) that
player 1 has chosen so as to interpret the quantifiers
\(\forall z_1 ,\ldots ,\forall z_m\).
The value \(f(a_1 ,\ldots ,a_m)\) is the left or the right disjunct
when the token is a disjunction; and an element of the domain when the
token is an existential quantifier.
</p>

<p>
The notion of the strategy function of player 1 for tokens of
\((\wedge /\exists y_1 ,\ldots ,\exists y_n)\) and \((\forall
x/\exists y_1 ,\ldots ,\exists y_n)\) can be defined dually. Strategy
functions are construed as Skolem functions &ndash; the more general
notion of strategy function operative in slash logic is not considered
here (cf. the beginning of
<em>Sect.</em> 3 and <em>Subsect.</em> 6.1). Quantifier indepenence
will be implemented directly in terms of the <em>arguments</em> of the
strategy functions.</p>

<p>
A <em>strategy</em> of player 2 in game \(G(\phi , M, g)\) is a set
\(F\) of her strategy functions, one function for each token of
\((\vee /\forall y_1 ,\ldots ,\forall y_n)\) and \((\exists x/\forall
y_1 ,\ldots ,\forall y_n)\) appearing in \(\phi\). Player 2 is said
to <em>follow</em> the strategy \(F\), if for each token of \((\vee
/\forall y_1 ,\ldots ,\forall y_n)\) and \((\exists x/\forall y_1
,\ldots ,\forall y_n)\) for which she must make a move when game
\(G(\phi , M, g)\) is played, she makes the move determined by the
corresponding strategy function. A <em>winning strategy</em> for
player 2 in \(G(\phi , M, g)\) is a strategy \(F\) such that against
any sequence of moves by player 1, following strategy \(F\) yields a
win for player 2. The notions of strategy and winning strategy can be
similarly defined for 
 player 1.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The <em>satisfaction</em> and <em>dissatisfaction</em> of the
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) formula \(\phi\) in the model \(M\) under the
assignment \(g\) are then <em>defined</em> as
 follows:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup></p>
 
<ul>

<li> <strong>(Satisfaction)</strong> \(\phi\) is satisfied in \(M\)
under \(g\) iff there is a winning strategy for player 2 in game
\(G(\phi , M, g)\). </li>

<li> <strong>(Dissatisfaction)</strong> \(\phi\) is dissatisfied in
\(M\) under \(g\) iff there is a winning strategy for player
1 in game \(G(\phi , M, g)\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
As with \(\mathbf{FO}\), variable assignments do not affect the
(dis)satisfaction of sentences, <em>i.e.</em>, formulas containing no
free variables. Indeed, we may
 define:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup></p>
 
<ul>

<li><strong>(Truth)</strong> \(\phi\) is true in \(M\) iff there is a
winning strategy for player 2 in game \(G(\phi , M)\).</li>

<li><strong>(Falsity)</strong> \(\phi\) is false in \(M\) iff there is
a winning strategy for player 1 in game \(G(\phi , M)\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The fact that \(\phi\) is true in \(M\) will be denoted by &lsquo;\(M
\vDash \phi\).&rsquo; Writing \(M \not\vDash \phi\) indicates, then,
that \(\phi\) is not true in \(M\). This does
<em>not</em> mean that \(\phi\) would in the above-defined sense be false
in \(M\). As mentioned in the end of <em>Section</em> 2, there
are semantic games in which neither player has a winning strategy.</p>

<p>
The syntax of \(\mathbf{IFL}\) can be generalized by removing the
restriction according to which the negation sign may only appear as
prefixed to an atomic
 formula.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>.
 In order to interpret negation in GTS, two <em>roles</em> are added
as a new ingredient in the specification of the games: those of
&lsquo;verifier&rsquo; and &lsquo;falsifier.&rsquo; Initially player 1
has the role of &lsquo;falsifier&rsquo; and player 2 that of
&lsquo;verifier.&rsquo; The roles may get switched, but only for one
reason: when negation is encountered. All clauses defining semantic
games must be rephrased in terms of roles instead of players. It is
the player whose role is &lsquo;verifier&rsquo; who makes a move for
disjunctions and existential quantifiers, and similarly the player
whose role is &lsquo;falsifier&rsquo; who moves for conjunctions and
universal quantifiers. When a formula \({\sim}\psi\) is encountered, the
players change roles and the game continues with \(\psi\). Finally, if
the encountered atomic formula is true, &lsquo;verifier&rsquo; wins
and &lsquo;falsifier&rsquo; loses, otherwise the payoffs are reversed.
The negation \({\sim}\) is variably referred to as <em>strong negation</em>,
<em>dual negation</em>, or <em>game-theoretical
 negation</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup>
 It works as one would expect: \(\phi\) is false in \(M\) iff its
negation \({\sim}\phi\) is true therein (cf. Sandu 1993). </p>

<h3><a name="BasProNot">3.3. Basic properties and notions</a></h3>

<p>
<strong>Failure of bivalence.</strong> There are sentences \(\phi\) of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) and models \(M\) such that \(\phi\) is neither true
nor false in \(M\). Consider evaluating the sentence \((\forall
x)(\exists y/\forall x) x = y\) on a model whose domain has exactly
two elements, \(a\) and \(b\). Player 1 has no winning strategy. If he
chooses \(a\) to interpret \(\forall x\), he loses the play in which
player 2 chooses \(a\) to interpret \((\exists y/\forall
x)\). Similarly, if player 1 chooses \(b\), he loses the play in which
player 2 likewise chooses \(b\). Neither does player 2 have a winning
strategy. Her strategy functions for \((\exists y/\forall x)\) are
constants (zero-place functions). There are two such constants
available: \(a\) and \(b\). Whichever one of these strategy functions
player 2 assumes, there is a move by player 1 defeating it.  If player
2 opts for \(a\), player 1 wins the play in which he chooses \(b\);
and if player 2 applies \(b\), player 1 wins the play in which he
chooses \(a\). Game \(G(\phi , M)\) is <em>non-determined</em>:
neither player has a winning 
 strategy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup> 
 The notion of non-determinacy may be extended to formulas as well:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>(Non-determinacy)</strong> \(\phi\) is non-determined in
\(M\) under \(g\) iff there is no winning strategy for player 1, nor
for player 2, in game \(G(\phi , M, g)\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
In \(\mathbf{IFL}\), falsity does not ensue from non-truth. That
is, bivalence fails in \(\mathbf{IFL}\). However, it should be
noted that it does not fail due to the postulation of a third
truth-value or a truth-value gap (cf. Hintikka 1991: 20,
 55).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup>
 Rather, the failure is a consequence of the basic assumptions of the
entire semantic theory (GTS). Non-determinacy corresponds to a
structural property: the fact that certain kinds of functions do not
exist on the model considered.</p>

<p>
Due to the failure of bivalence, the logical law of excluded middle
fails for the dual negation \({\sim}\). Actually, \(\phi\) is
non-determined in \(M\) iff \(M \not\vDash(\phi
\vee{\sim}\phi)\). </p>

<p>
<strong>Logical equivalence.</strong> Sentences \(\psi\) and \(\chi\) of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) are <em>truth equivalent</em> if they are true in
precisely the same models, and <em>falsity equivalent</em> if they are
false in precisely the same models. Sentences \(\psi\) and \(\chi\) are
<em>logically equivalent</em> if they are both truth equivalent and
falsity
 equivalent.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup>
 Due to the failure of bivalence, in \(\mathbf{IFL}\) truth
equivalence does not guarantee logical equivalence. </p>

<p>
<strong>Truth, falsity, and independence indications.</strong> The
syntax of \(\mathbf{IFL}\) allows formulas in which both universal
and existential quantifiers appear slashed, <em>e.g.</em>,</p>

\[
\phi : (\forall x)(\exists y/\forall x)(\forall z/\exists y) R(x, y, z).
\]

<p>
On the other hand, quantifier independence is implemented at the level
of strategies. Consequently independence indications following a
universal quantifier are vacuous, when the satisfaction of a formula
(truth of a sentence) is considered. Similarly, independence
indications following an existential quantifier are vacuous when the
dissatisfaction of a formula (falsity of a sentence) is at stake. The
sentence \(\phi\) is true in the model \(M\) iff player 2 has a
winning strategy \(F=\{c\}\) in game \(G(\phi , M)\). This, again,
means that whichever elements \(a\) and \(b\) player 1 chooses to
interpret \((\forall x)\) and \((\forall z/\exists y)\), respectively,
the constant interpretation \(c\) of \((\exists y/\forall x)\) given
by the (zero-place) strategy function \(c\) satisfies \(R(a, c, b)\)
in \(M\). But this amounts to the same as requiring that whichever
elements \(a\) and \(b\) player 1 chooses to interpret \((\forall x)\)
and \((\forall z)\), respectively, the constant interpretation \(c\)
of \((\exists y/\forall x)\) satisfies \(R(a, c, b)\) in
\(M\). Indeed, \(\phi\) is truth equivalent to a sentence containing
no slashed universal quantifiers: </p>

<p class="indent">
\(\phi\) is true in a model \(M\) iff the sentence \((\forall
x)(\exists y/\forall x)(\forall z) R(x, y, z)\) is true in \(M\).
</p>

<p>
Similarly, \(\phi\) is falsity equivalent to a sentence containing no
slashed existential quantifiers: \(\phi\) is false in a model \(M\)
iff the sentence \((\forall x)(\exists y)(\forall z/\exists y) R(x, y,
z)\) is false therein.</p>

<h3><a name="ExtIFFirOrdLog">3.4. Extended IF first-order logic</a></h3>

<p>
If \(\phi\) is a sentence of \(\mathbf{FO}\), \(\phi\) is false in a
model \(M\) iff \({\sim}\phi\) is true in \(M\) iff \(\phi\) is not
true in \(M\). By contrast, in \(\mathbf{IFL}\) falsity and
non-truth do not coincide. An extension of \(\mathbf{IFL}\) can be
introduced, where it is possible to speak of the non-truth of
sentences. To this end, let us introduce a new negation symbol, \(\neg\),
referred to as <em>weak negation</em>, <em>contradictory negation</em>
or <em>classical
 negation</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup>
 The set of formulas of <em>extended IF first-order logic</em> (to be
denoted \(\mathbf{EIFL})\) is obtained from the set of formulas of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) by closing it under the operations \(\neg\), \(\wedge\),
and
 \(\vee\):<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup></p>
 
<ul>

<li>All formulas of \(\mathbf{IFL}\) are formulas of
\(\mathbf{EIFL}\).</li>

<li>If \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) are formulas of \(\mathbf{EIFL}\), then
so are \(\neg \phi , (\phi \wedge \psi)\) and \((\phi \vee
\psi)\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
So if \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) are \(\mathbf{IFL}\) formulas, <em>e.g.</em>
\(\neg \phi\) and \((\neg \phi \vee \psi)\) are \(\mathbf{EIFL}\)
formulas; by contrast \((\forall x)\neg \phi\) is not. For the
crucial restriction that \(\neg\) may not occur in the scope of a
quantifier, see Hintikka (1991: 49; 1996: 148). For counterexamples to
this restriction see, however, Hintikka (1996: 148; 2002c) and
especially Hintikka (2006b) in which the so-called <em>fully extended
IF first-order logic</em> (<strong>FEIFL</strong>) is considered. In
<strong>FEIFL</strong>, any occurrences of \(\neg\) are allowed which are
subject to the following syntactic condition: if
(Q\(x/W)\) is a quantifier in the syntactic scope of an
occurrence of \(\neg\), then all quantifiers listed in \(W\) are
likewise in the syntactic scope of that occurrence of \(\neg\).</p>

<p>
The semantics of an \(\mathbf{EIFL}\) formula formed by
contradictory negation is simply this:</p>

\[
M, g \vDash \neg \phi \text{ iff } M, g \not\vDash \phi.
\]

<p>
From the viewpoint of GTS, the connective \(\neg\) behaves in an unusual
way. For all connectives of \(\mathbf{IFL}\), there is a game rule
(which can be seen as specifying the meaning of the connective). For
contradictory negation there is no game rule, and its semantics is not
explained in terms of plays of semantic games. A formula \(\neg \phi\)
serves to say, globally, something about an entire game
\(G(\phi , M, g)\). If \(\phi\) is a sentence, to
say that \(\neg \phi\) is true in \(M\) is to say that player 2 does
<em>not</em> have a winning strategy in game \(G(\phi ,
M)\). If, again, there is indeed a winning strategy for player
2 in \(G(\phi , M)\), by stipulation \(\neg \phi\) is false
in
 \(M\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Not only is \(\neg \phi\) not itself a formula of \(\mathbf{IFL}\),
but it cannot in general even be expressed in \(\mathbf{IFL}\)
(see <em>Subsect.</em> 4.2). The law of excluded middle holds for the
contradictory negation: for all sentences \(\phi\) and all models
\(M\), indeed \(M \vDash(\phi \vee \neg \phi)\). In
<em>Section</em> 5 it will be seen how Hintikka has proposed to make
use of \(\mathbf{EIFL}\) when discussing issues in the philosophy
of mathematics. </p>

<h2><a name="MetProIFFirOrdLog">4. Metalogical Properties of IF First-order Logic</a></h2>

<p>
The metalogical properties of \(\mathbf{IFL}\) have been discussed
in several publications, by Hintikka as well as
 Sandu.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup>
 When presenting them, reference will be made to <em>existential
second-order logic</em>
 \((\mathbf{ESO})\);<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup>
 further important notions are those of the <em>skolemization</em> and
<em>Skolem normal form</em> of an \(\mathbf{IFL}\) formula. For
precise definitions of these notions,
 <a href="supplement.html" name="return-1">the supplementary document</a>
 can be consulted. In brief, \(\mathbf{ESO}\) is obtained from
\(\mathbf{FO}\) by allowing existential quantification over
relation and function symbols in a first-order formula. The
skolemization \(\mathrm{sk}[\phi]\) of an \(\mathbf{IFL}\) formula \(\phi\) is
a <em>first-order</em> formula of a larger vocabulary. It explicates
in terms of function symbols how existential quantifiers and
disjunction symbols of \(\phi\) depend on preceding universal
quantifiers. For example, a skolemization of the \(\mathbf{IFL}\)
sentence \(\phi = (\forall x)(\exists y)(\forall z)(\exists v/\forall
x)R(x, y, z, v)\) of vocabulary \(\{R\}\) is the \(\mathbf{FO}\)
sentence \(\mathrm{sk}[\phi] = (\forall x)(\forall z)R(x, f(x), z, h(z))\) of
vocabulary \(\{R, f, h\}\). Its Skolem normal form, again, is the
\(\mathbf{ESO}\) sentence \(\mathrm{SK}[\phi] = (\exists f)(\exists h)(\forall
x)(\forall z)R(x, f(x), z, h(z))\). The first-order sentence
\(\mathrm{sk}[\phi]\) must not be confused with the second-order sentence
\(\mathrm{SK}[\phi]\). </p>

<strong>Game-theoretical vs. Tarskian semantics of FO.</strong> The

 the two semantics of \(\mathbf{FO}\) coincide:</p>

</p>
 
<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem</strong> <strong>(assuming AC)</strong>
\(\mathbf{ESO}\) and \(\mathbf{IFL}\) have the same expressive
power.
</p>

<p>
That is, (1) for every \(\mathbf{IFL}[\tau]\) formula \(\phi\) there
is an \(\mathbf{ESO}[\tau]\) formula \(\phi'\) such that for all
\(\tau\) structures \(M\) and variable assignments \(g\), we have:
\(M, g \vDash \phi\) iff \(M, g \vDash \phi'\). Actually,
\(\mathrm{SK}[\phi]\) is a suitable \(\mathbf{ESO}\) formula. And (2)
for every \(\mathbf{ESO}[\tau]\) formula \(\psi\) there is an
\(\mathbf{IFL}[\tau]\) formula \(\psi'\) such that \(M, g \vDash
\psi\) iff \(M, g \vDash \psi'\), for all \(\tau\) structures \(M\)
and variable assignments \(g\). This follows from the fact that
\(\mathbf{ESO}\) can be translated into \(\mathbf{FPO}\) (Enderton
1970, Walkoe 1970), which again can be translated into
\(\mathbf{IFL}\).</p>

<p>
Hintikka suggests that \(\mathbf{IFL}\) is, substantially
speaking, a <em>first-order</em> logic: the entities its quantified
variables range over are <em>individuals</em>, and so are all entities
with which the players of the semantic games operate. (See
<em>Subsect.</em> 5.1 for a discussion of this idea.) A part of the
interest of the intertranslatability theorem lies in the fact that if
Hintikka&rsquo;s controversial claim is accepted, this would mean that
the expressive power of \(\mathbf{ESO}\) can actually be achieved
on the first-order level.</p>

<p>
<strong>IFL is more expressive than FO.</strong> The following are
examples of properties expressible in \(\mathbf{ESO}\) but not in
\(\mathbf{FO}\): infinity of the domain, non-completeness of a
linear order, ill-foundedness of a binary relation, disconnectedness
of a graph, equicardinality of the extensions of two first-order
formulas \(\phi(x)\) and \(\psi(x)\), infinity of the
extension of a first-order formula \(\phi(x)\), and the
topological notion of open set (see, <em>e.g.</em>, Hintikka 1996,
V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen 2007). When attention is restricted to
<em>finite</em> models, Ronald Fagin&rsquo;s famous theorem (1974)
connects \(\mathbf{ESO}\) and the complexity class
\(\mathbf{NP}\): a computational problem is solvable by an
algorithm running in non-deterministic polynomial time iff it is
definable in \(\mathbf{ESO}\) relative to the class of all finite
structures. The following are \(\mathbf{NP}\)-complete properties
and hence expressible in \(\mathbf{IFL}\), over the class of all
finite models: evenness of the domain, oddness of the domain,
3-colorability of a graph, and the existence of a Hamiltonian path on
a
 graph.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-37" id="ref-37">37</a>]</sup></p>
 

<p>
As an example the Dedekind-infinity of the domain may be considered. A
set \(S\) is Dedekind-infinite precisely when there exists an
injective function from \(S\) to its proper subset. Let
\(\phi_{inf}\) be the following sentence of
 \(\mathbf{IFL}\):<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-38" id="ref-38">38</a>]</sup></p>
 
\[
(\exists t)(\forall x)(\exists z)(\forall y)(\exists v/\forall x)((x = y \leftrightarrow z = v) \wedge z \ne t).
\]

<p>
The Skolem normal form of \(\phi_{inf}\) is 
</p>

\[
(\exists f)(\exists g)(\exists t)(\forall x)(\forall y)((x = y
\leftrightarrow f(x) = g(y)) \wedge f(x) \ne t).
\]

<p>
Relative to a model \(M\) this
\(\mathbf{ESO}\) sentence asserts the existence of functions \(f\) and
\(g\) and an element \(t\) such that \(f = g\) (implication from left
to right), this function is injective (implication from right to
left), and its domain is the whole domain of \(M\) but the element
\(t\) does not appear in its range. Consequently the range is a proper
subset of the domain of \(M\). In other words, the sentence
\(\phi_{inf}\) is true in a model \(M\) iff the domain of \(M\) is
infinite.</p>

It is well known that for \(\mathbf{FO}\) there is a sound and

inconsistent (non-satisfiable) iff its negation \({\sim}\phi\) is valid (true
in all models), trivially \(\mathbf{FO}\) also has a sound and
complete disproof
 procedure.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-40" id="ref-40">40</a>]</sup>

does not, see <em>Subsect.</em> 4.3):</p>

<h3><a name="IntNeg">4.2. Intricacies of negation</a></h3>

<p>
In <em>Subsection</em> 3.4, the contradictory negation \(\neg\) was
distinguished from the strong negation \({\sim}\). In \(\mathbf{FO}\)
the two coincide: for any first-order sentence \(\phi\), we have \(M
\vDash{\sim}\phi\) iff \(M \vDash \neg \phi\). </p>

<p>
<strong>Strong negation fails as a semantic operation.</strong> Let us
write \([\phi]\) for the set of models of sentence \(\phi\). In the special
case of \(\mathbf{FO}\), the strong negation \({\sim}\) clearly defines a
semantic operation: whenever \(\chi\) and \(\theta\) are sentences such that
\([\chi] = [\theta]\), we have \([{\sim}\chi] = [{\sim}\theta]\). Burgess (2003)
observed that in the context of IF logic this property is lost in a
very strong sense. In fact there are IF sentences \(\chi\) and \(\theta\)
such that while \([\chi] = [\theta]\), the sets \([{\sim}\chi]\) and \([{\sim}\theta]\)
are not only distinct but even disjoint. </p>

<p>
<strong>Inexpressibility of contradictory negation.</strong> In
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) the strong negation \({\sim}\) and the contradictory
negation \(\neg\) do <em>not</em> coincide: we may have \(M \vDash
\neg \phi\) without having \(M \vDash{\sim}\phi\). This fact by itself
still leaves open the possibility that the contradictory negation of
every sentence \(\phi\) of \(\mathbf{IFL}\) could be defined in
\(\mathbf{IFL}\), <em>i.e.</em>, that there was a sentence
\(neg(\phi)\) of \(\mathbf{IFL}\) such that \(M \vDash\) \(neg(\phi)\)
iff \(M \not\vDash \phi\), for all models \(M\). All we know by the
failure of the law of excluded middle is that not in all cases can
\(neg(\phi)\) be chosen to be \({\sim}\phi\). However, as a matter of
fact contradictory negation is inexpressible in
\(\mathbf{IFL}\). There are sentences \(\phi\) of \(\mathbf{IFL}\)
such that \(\neg \phi\) (which is a sentence of \(\mathbf{EIFL})\) is
not truth equivalent to any sentence of \(\mathbf{IFL}\). This follows
from the well-known fact that \(\mathbf{ESO}\) is not closed under
negation and \(\mathbf{IFL}\) has the same expressive power as
 \(\mathbf{ESO}\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-41" id="ref-41">41</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
<strong>Strong inexpressibility of contradictory negation.</strong> As
a corollary to the separation theorem, the result holds in a much
stronger form. If \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) are sentences of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) such that \(M \vDash \phi\) iff \(M \not\vDash
\psi\), then each of \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) is truth equivalent to a
sentence of \(\mathbf{FO}\). Hence the contradictory negation \(\neg
\phi\) is only expressible in \(\mathbf{IFL}\) for those
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) sentences \(\phi\) that are truth equivalent to an
\(\mathbf{FO}\) 
 sentence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-42" id="ref-42">42</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
<strong>Determined fragment.</strong> Let us say that an
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) sentence \(\phi\) is <em>determined</em> if it
satisfies: \(M \vDash(\phi \vee{\sim}\phi)\), for all models
\(M\). The <em>determined fragment</em> of \(\mathbf{IFL}\)
is the set of determined \(\mathbf{IFL}\) sentences. In the
determined fragment contradictory negation <em>is</em> syntactically
expressible by the strong negation. By the strong inexpressibility of
contradictory negation, the determined fragment of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) has the same expressive power as
\(\mathbf{FO}\). Membership in the determined fragment is a
sufficient but not necessary condition for an \(\mathbf{IFL}\)
sentence to have its contradictory negation expressible in
\(\mathbf{IFL}\). The sentence
\((\forall y)(\exists x/\forall y) x = y\) is not
 determined;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-43" id="ref-43">43</a>]</sup>
 yet its contradictory negation \((\forall x)(\exists y) x \ne y\) is
expressible in \(\mathbf{IFL}\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Contradictory negation and GTS.</strong> The truth-conditions
that GTS yields are of the form &lsquo;there are strategy functions
\(f_1 ,\ldots ,f_n\) such
that &mdash;,&rsquo; <em>i.e.</em>, it gives rise to truth-conditions
expressible in \(\mathbf{ESO}\). By the strong inexpressibility of
contradictory negation, there is no single \(\mathbf{IFL}\)
sentence, not translatable into \(\mathbf{FO}\), whose
contradictory negation has a truth-condition of that form. This fact
makes it understandable why contradictory negation should not be
expected to admit of a game-theoretical interpretation along the same
lines in which the other logical operators are interpreted. Different
ways of assigning a game-theoretical interpretation to contradictory
negation can, however, be developed. To this end, in the context of
<em>fully extended IF first-order logic</em> (<strong>FEIFL</strong>,
cf. Subsect. 3.4), Hintikka has proposed to use semantic games with
<em>subgames</em>. (See Hintikka 2002c, 2006b; for subgames, see
Carlson &amp; Hintikka 1979, Hintikka &amp; Kulas 1983.) This approach
leads to mixing the play level with the strategy level: choices of
individuals made in a subgame may depend on strategy functions chosen
in earlier subgames. In Tulenheimo (2014), a game-theoretical
semantics is formulated for the fragment of <strong>FEIFL</strong>
that consists of formulas in prenex form. Plays of the correlated
games do not involve choosing any second-order objects, such as
strategy functions. Contradictory negation \((\neg)\) is interpreted by
introducing an additional component in game positions: a
<em>mode</em>. At the play level, the negation \(\neg\) triggers not only a
role switch (like the dual negation \({\sim})\), but it also involves changing
the mode from positive to negative or vice versa. The semantic effect
of modes becomes visible at the strategy level: modes regulate the way
in which the truth condition of a sentence involves existentially or
universally quantifying over strategy functions. Like independence
indications, also occurrences of \(\neg\) are, then, interpreted in terms of
conditions that act on the strategy level. For related research, see
Figueira <em>et al.</em> (2011).</p>

<p>
<strong>Contradictory negation and finite models.</strong> Certain
major open questions in logic and theoretical computer science can be
formulated in terms of \(\mathbf{IFL}\). It is an open question in
complexity theory whether \(\mathbf{NP} = \mathbf{coNP}\),
that is, whether the class of \(\mathbf{NP}\)-solvable problems is
the same as the class of problems whose complement is solvable in
\(\mathbf{NP}\). By Fagin&rsquo;s theorem (1974), this open
problem can be equivalently formulated as follows: Is
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) closed under negation <em>over finite
models</em>? That is, is there for every IF sentence \(\phi\) another IF
sentence \(neg(\phi)\) such that for any finite model
\(M\), \(neg(\phi)\) is true in \(M\) iff \(\phi\) is not
true in \(M\)? Proving that the answer is negative would settle
the notorious \(\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{NP}\) problem, i.e.,
establish that there are computational problems for which one can
efficiently <em>verify</em> whether a proposed solution is correct
although one cannot efficiently <em>find</em> a
 solution.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-44" id="ref-44">44</a>]</sup></p>
 

<h3><a name="FaiAxi">4.3 Failure of axiomatizability</a></h3>

<p>
As is well known, \(\mathbf{FO}\) admits of a sound and complete
proof procedure: there is a mechanical way of generating precisely
those first-order sentences that are valid (true in all models). This
fact can also be expressed by saying that \(\mathbf{FO}\) is
axiomatizable, or that the set of valid sentences of
\(\mathbf{FO}\) is recursively
 enumerable.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-45" id="ref-45">45</a>]</sup>
 Due to its greater expressive power, axiomatizability <em>fails</em>
for \(\mathbf{IFL}\). In other words, \(\mathbf{IFL}\) is
semantically
 incomplete.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-46" id="ref-46">46</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
One way to show this is as follows. Suppose for the sake of
contradiction that the set of valid \(\mathbf{IFL}\) sentences is
recursively enumerable. Recall that the sentence
\(\phi_{inf}\) discussed in <em>Subsection</em> 4.1 is
true in all and only infinite models. Note, then, that an
\(\mathbf{FO}\) sentence \(\chi\) is true in all <em>finite</em>
models iff the \(\mathbf{IFL}\) sentence
\((\phi_{inf} \vee \chi)\) is valid. Given a valid
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) sentence, it can be effectively checked whether
the sentence is syntactically of the form
\((\phi_{inf} \vee \chi)\), where \(\chi\) is a
first-order sentence. Hence the recursive enumeration of all valid
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) sentences yields a recursive enumeration of
first-order sentences \(\chi\) true in all finite models. But this
contradicts Trakhtenbrot&rsquo;s theorem, according to which the set
of \(\mathbf{FO}\) sentences true in all finite models is
<em>not</em> recursively
 enumerable.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-47" id="ref-47">47</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
What is the relevance of the failure of axiomatizability of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\)? Discussing finite partially ordered quantifiers,
Quine (1970: 89&ndash;91) suggests that we should refuse to give the
status of logic to any generalization of \(\mathbf{FO}\) which
does not have a sound and complete proof procedure <em>both</em> for
validity <em>and</em> for inconsistency. For Quine, any such
generalization belongs to mathematics rather than logic. Since
\(\mathbf{FPO}\) is not axiomatizable, it falls outside the realm
of logic, thus
 delineated.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-48" id="ref-48">48</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Hintikka finds this type of allegation unfounded. First,
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) shares many of the important metalogical results
with \(\mathbf{FO}\) (cf. <em>Subsect.</em> 4.1). Second, just
like \(\mathbf{IFL}\), also \(\mathbf{FO}\) can be translated
into second-order logic. The only difference is that in the former
case a larger variety of quantifier (in)dependencies must be encoded
by Skolem functions than in the latter. Why would the former
translation render \(\mathbf{IFL}\) a part of mathematics while
the latter would allow \(\mathbf{FO}\) to remain a logic (Hintikka
1991: 26&ndash;27)? Third, one must make a distinction between what is
needed to understand an \(\mathbf{IFL}\) sentence, and what is
needed to mechanically deal with the validities (logical truths) of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\). Due to its non-axiomatizability, there are no
mechanical rules for generating the set of all validities of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\). However, to understand a sentence is to know
what things are like when it is <em>true</em>, not to know what things
are like when it is <em>logically true</em> (Hintikka 1995:
13&ndash;14). Fourth, because of non-axiomatizability, the valid
inference patterns in \(\mathbf{IFL}\) cannot be exhausted by any
recursive enumeration. Insofar as important mathematical problems can
be reduced to questions about the validity of \(\mathbf{IFL}\)
formulas (<em>Subsect.</em> 5.3), progress in mathematics can be seen
to consist (not of the discovery of stronger set-theoretical axioms
but) of ever more powerful rules for establishing validity in
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) (Hintikka 1996: 100; 2000: 135&ndash;136).</p>

<h3><a name="ComFaiTarTypSem">4.4 Compositionality and the failure of Tarski-type semantics</a></h3>

<p>
The principle of compositionality (a.k.a. Frege principle) states that
semantic attributes of a complex expression \(E\) are determined
by the semantic attributes of its constituent expressions and the
structure of \(E\). In particular, the semantic attribute of
interest (<em>e.g.</em>, truth) may be determined in terms of one or
more auxiliary semantic attributes (<em>e.g.</em>,
 satisfaction).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-49" id="ref-49">49</a>]</sup>
 Hintikka has argued that compositionality amounts to <em>semantic
context-independence</em>: semantic attributes of a complex expression
depend <em>only</em> on the semantic attributes of its constituent
expressions, plus its structure &ndash; they do <em>not</em> depend on
the sentential context in which the expression is embedded. Semantic
context-independence makes it possible to carry out semantic analysis
from <em>inside out</em> &ndash; from simpler expressions to more
complex
 ones.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-50" id="ref-50">50</a>]</sup>
 This is what is needed for recursive definitions of semantic
attributes &ndash; such as Tarski-type definitions of truth and
satisfiability &ndash; to be
 possible.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-51" id="ref-51">51</a>]</sup>
 By contrast, the GTS analysis of sentences is an <em>outside in</em>
process: a semantic game starts with an entire sentence, and stepwise
analyzes the sentence into simpler and simpler components, eventually
reaching an atomic formula (together with an appropriate variable
assignment). Therefore GTS allows accounting for semantic
context-dependencies that violate the principle of
 compositionality.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-52" id="ref-52">52</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In \(\mathbf{IFL}\) an existential quantifier may depend only on
<em>some</em> of the universal quantifiers in whose scope it lies.
Accordingly, its interpretation depends on its relation to quantifiers
outside its own scope. Such an existential quantifier is
 context-dependent.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-53" id="ref-53">53</a>]</sup>
 On the face of it, then, \(\mathbf{IFL}\) cannot but violate the
principle of compositionality and does not admit of a Tarski-type
truth-definition. </p>

<p>
Hodges (1997a,b) showed, however, that \(\mathbf{IFL}\) can be
given a compositional
 semantics.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-54" id="ref-54">54</a>]</sup>
 The semantics is given by recursively defining the satisfaction
relation &lsquo;\(M \vDash_X \phi\)&rsquo;
(read: \(\phi\) is satisfied in \(M\) by \(X)\), where
\(X\) is a <em>set</em> of variable assignments. While the
Tarskian semantics for \(\mathbf{FO}\) is in terms of single
variable assignments, Hodges&rsquo;s semantics employs sets of
variable assignments. The game-theoretical semantics of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) is captured by this compositional semantics: for
every formula \(\phi\) of \(\mathbf{IFL}\), player 2 has a winning
strategy in \(G(\phi , M, g)\) iff the
condition \(M \vDash_{\{g\}} \phi\) holds.
Hintikka remarks (2006a: 65) that if one is sufficiently ruthless, one
can always save compositionality by building the laws of semantic
interaction of different expressions into the respective meanings of
those
 expressions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-55" id="ref-55">55</a>]</sup></p>
 

<p>
It is methodologically worth pointing out that compositionality is not
<em>needed</em> for defining \(\mathbf{IFL}\). The very existence
of \(\mathbf{IFL}\) proves that rejecting compositionality is no
obstacle for the formulation of a powerful logic (Hintikka 1995). It
should also be noted that what makes Hodges&rsquo;s result work is its
type-theoretical ascent. Let us say that a <em>Tarski-type</em>
compositional semantics is a compositional semantics which interprets
each formula \(\phi(x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n)\) of \(n\) free variables in terms of an
\(n\)-tuple of elements of the domain. Hence the standard
semantics of \(\mathbf{FO}\) is Tarski-type, but Hodges&rsquo;s
semantics employing the satisfaction relation &lsquo;\(M \vDash_X \phi\)&rsquo; is not, because the latter
evaluates a formula \(\phi(x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n)\) of \(n\) free variables relative to an
entire <em>set</em> of \(n\)-tuples of elements. Cameron &amp;
Hodges (2001) proved that actually there is \(no\) Tarski-type
compositional semantics for \(\mathbf{IFL}\). </p>

<p>
The notion of compositionality can be refined by imposing constraints
on the auxiliary semantic attributes. Sandu and Hintikka (2001: 60)
suggested, by analogy with \(\mathbf{FO}\), that
&lsquo;satisfaction by a single variable assignment&rsquo; would be a
natural auxiliary attribute in connection with \(\mathbf{IFL}\).
By the result of Cameron and Hodges, no semantics for
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) exists that would be compositional in this
restricted sense.</p>

<h3><a name="DefTru">4.5 Defining truth</a></h3>

<p>
The definability of truth can only be discussed in connection with
languages capable of speaking of themselves. Let us consider an
arithmetical vocabulary \(\tau\) and restrict attention to the standard
model \(N\) of Peano&rsquo;s axioms. Each sentence \(\phi\) of
vocabulary \(\tau\) can then be represented by a natural number
\(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner\), its G&ouml;del number. It
is assumed that \(\tau\) contains a numeral
\(\boldsymbol{{}^\ulcorner \phi {}^\urcorner}\) for each
number \(\ulcorner \phi \urcorner\). If \(L\) and
\(L'\) are abstract logics of vocabulary \(\tau\), such as
\(\mathbf{FO}\) or \(\mathbf{IFL}\), and
\(\TRUE(x)\) is a formula of \(L'\) such that
every sentence \(\phi\) of \(L\) satisfies: </p>

\[
N \vDash \phi \text{ iff } N \vDash \TRUE(\boldsymbol{{}^\ulcorner \phi {}^\urcorner}),
\]


<p>
then \(\TRUE(x)\) is said to be a
<em>truth-predicate</em> (<em><em>explicit</em>
truth-</em><em>definition</em>) of logic \(L\) in logic
\(L'\) for the model \(N\). By Alfred Tarski&rsquo;s
famous theorem of the <em>undefinability of truth</em> (Tarski 1933),
there is no truth-predicate for \(\mathbf{FO}\) in
\(\mathbf{FO}\) itself for the model \(N\). More generally,
Tarski showed that under certain assumptions, a truth-definition for a
logic \(L\) can only be given in a metalanguage which is
essentially stronger than \(L\). One of the assumptions is that
the negation used behaves like contradictory negation. On the other
hand, Tarski also pointed out that an implicit truth-definition for
\(\mathbf{FO}\) in \(\mathbf{FO}\) itself <em>is</em>
possible. Let \(\tau\) be an arithmetical vocabulary, and let us stay
with the standard model \(N\) of Peano&rsquo;s axioms. Let
&lsquo;\(\TRUE\)&rsquo; be a unary predicate not appearing in
\(\tau\). An \(\mathbf{FO}\) formula \(\psi(x)\) of vocabulary
\(\tau \cup \{\TRUE\}\) is an <em>implicit truth-definition</em>
for \(\mathbf{FO}[\tau]\) in \(\mathbf{FO}[\tau \cup \{\TRUE\}]\) for \(N\), if for every
\(\mathbf{FO}[\tau]\) sentence \(\phi\), the following holds: </p>

<p class="indent">
\(N \vDash \phi\) iff there is an interpretation
\(\TRUE^N\) of the unary predicate \(\TRUE\) such that 
 \((N, \TRUE^N ) \vDash \psi(\boldsymbol{{}^\ulcorner \phi {}^\urcorner})\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-56" id="ref-56">56</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
Intuitively, \(\TRUE^N\) is the set of those
natural numbers that are G&ouml;del numbers of true arithmetic
sentences of vocabulary \(\tau\); and \(\psi(x)\) says that
\(x\) is a G&ouml;del number in the extension of the predicate
\(\TRUE\). The formula \(\psi(x)\) is a conjunction
including clauses that mimic, on the object-language level, the
metalogical recursive clauses of the Tarski-type truth-definition for
\(\mathbf{FO}\). <em>E.g.</em>, one of the conjuncts is</p>

\[\begin{align*} 
(\forall y)(\forall z)(y = \boldsymbol{{}^\ulcorner \chi {}^\urcorner}
 &amp;\wedge z = \boldsymbol{{}^\ulcorner \theta {}^\urcorner} \wedge 
  x = \boldsymbol{{}^\ulcorner (\chi \wedge \theta) {}^\urcorner} \rightarrow \\
 &amp;[\TRUE(x) \leftrightarrow (\TRUE(y) \wedge \TRUE(z))]).
\end{align*}\]

<p>
The implicit nature of the truth-definition is seen from the fact that
the predicate \(\TRUE\) appears on both sides of the equivalence
sign in these
 clauses.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-57" id="ref-57">57</a>]</sup>
 The above implicit truth-definition of \(\mathbf{FO}\) for \(N\) is
of the form &lsquo;there is a set \(S\) interpreting the
predicate \(\TRUE\) such that \(\psi(x)\).&rsquo; Thus the
implicit truth-definition of \(\mathbf{FO}\) in \(\mathbf{FO}\) gives
rise to the explicit truth-definition \(\exists \TRUE\, \psi(x)\) of
\(\mathbf{FO}[\tau]\) in \(\mathbf{ESO}[\tau]\) for \(N\). Since
\(\mathbf{ESO}\) and \(\mathbf{IFL}\) have the same expressive power,
a truth-predicate of \(\mathbf{FO}\) for \(N\) can be formulated in
\(\mathbf{IFL}\). </p>

<p>
The same reasoning can be applied to \(\mathbf{ESO}\) itself, and
thereby to \(\mathbf{IFL}\) (Hintikka 1991, 1996; Hyttinen &amp; Sandu
2000; Sandu 1996, 1998). Namely, an \(\mathbf{ESO}\) formula
\(\chi(x)\) of vocabulary \(\tau \cup \{\TRUE\}\) can be formulated
which is an <em>implicit</em> truth-definition of
\(\mathbf{ESO}[\tau]\) for \(N\). Therefore the \(\mathbf{ESO}[\tau]\)
formula \(\exists \TRUE\, \chi(x)\) is an <em>explicit</em>
truth-definition of \(\mathbf{ESO}[\tau]\) for \(N\). Here the
truth-predicate is formulated in the very same language whose notion
of truth is being defined: \(\mathbf{ESO}\). Hence \(\mathbf{ESO}\),
and thereby \(\mathbf{IFL}\), is capable of explicitly defining its
own truth-predicate relative to \(N\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-58" id="ref-58">58</a>]</sup> 
 This result does not contradict
Tarski&rsquo;s undefinability result, because here non-determined
sentences are possible; the negation used is not contradictory
negation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-59" id="ref-59">59</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Tarski (1983) adopted a view accoding to which truth cannot be defined
for natural languages. It has been argued in Hintikka &amp; Sandu
(1999) that this was due to Tarski&rsquo;s belief that
compositionality fails in natural
 languages.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-60" id="ref-60">60</a>]</sup>
 \(\mathbf{IFL}\) does not have a Tarski-type compositional
semantics, but it admits of formulating a self-applied
truth-predicate. The proposed reason why Tarski believed it not to be
possible to discuss the notion of truth in natural languages
themselves, cannot be entertained from the viewpoint of
 \(\mathbf{IFL}\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-61" id="ref-61">61</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<h3><a name="ProExtIFFirOrdLog">4.6 Properties of extended IF first-order logic</a></h3>

<p>
<strong>Expressive power.</strong> Since \(\mathbf{IFL}\) is not
closed under contradictory negation, \(\mathbf{EIFL}\) is strictly
more expressive than \(\mathbf{IFL}\) (cf. <em>Subsect.</em>
 4.2).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-62" id="ref-62">62</a>]</sup>
 The following properties are expressible in \(\mathbf{EIFL}\) but
not in \(\mathbf{IFL}\) (Hintikka 1996: 188&ndash;190): finiteness
of the domain, well-foundedness of a binary relation, connectedness of
a graph, principle of mathematical induction, Bolzano-Weierstrass
theorem, and the topological notion of continuity.</p>

<p>
<strong>Metalogical properties.</strong> The nice metatheorems that
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) shares with \(\mathbf{FO}\) are lost:
Compactness, L&ouml;wenheim-Skolem property, separation theorem, and
the existence of a complete disproof procedure all fail for
\(\mathbf{EIFL}\) (Hintikka 1991: 49, 1996: 189). No self-applied
truth-predictate is possible for \(\mathbf{EIFL}\). The definition
of such a truth-predicate would have to contain the clause</p>

\[\begin{align*}
(\forall y)(y = \boldsymbol{{}^\ulcorner \theta {}^\urcorner} &amp;\wedge 
 x = \boldsymbol{{}^\ulcorner \neg \theta {}^\urcorner} \rightarrow \\
 &amp;[\TRUE(x) \leftrightarrow \neg \TRUE(y)]).
\end{align*}\]

<p>
But this clause is not a well-formed formula of \(\mathbf{EIFL}\),
since \(\neg\) appears in the scope of the universal quantifier
\((\forall y)\) (cf. Hintikka 1996: 151).</p>

<p>
The validity problem of the full second-order can be effectively
reduced to the validity problem of \(\mathbf{EIFL}\). Namely, why
cannot a second-order sentence simply be thought of as a two-sorted
first-order sentence? Because in order to capture the standard
interpretation of second-order
 logic,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-63" id="ref-63">63</a>]</sup>
 it must be said that for every extensionally possible set of
\(n\)-tuples of elements of sort 1 there exists a member of sort
2 having those and only those elements as members, for all arities
\(n\) such that the second-order sentence contains a quantifier
\((\exists R)\) where \(R\) is
 \(n\)-ary.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-64" id="ref-64">64</a>]</sup>
 Such additional conditions can be expressed by a finite conjunction
\(X\) of contradictory negations of \(\mathbf{ESO}\)
sentences. So there is an \(\mathbf{ESO}\) sentence \(Y\)
such that \(X\) itself is logically equivalent to
\(\neg Y\). Therefore, if \(\phi\) is a second-order sentence and
\(\phi^*\) its reconstruction in two-sorted first-order logic, we have:
\(\phi\) is valid iff \((\neg X \vee \phi^*)\) is valid iff
\((Y \vee \phi^*)\) is valid. The validity of \((\neg X \vee \phi^*)\) means that \(\phi^*\) is a logical consequence of \(X\).
Because \(Y\) is an \(\mathbf{ESO}\) sentence, it can be
expressed in \(\mathbf{IFL}\). It follows that the validity of any
second-order sentence can be expressed as the validity of a sentence
of
 \(\mathbf{IFL}\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-65" id="ref-65">65</a>]</sup></p>
 

<p>
<strong>Algebraic structure.</strong> The two negations available in
\(\mathbf{EIFL}, \neg\) and \({\sim}\), agree on true sentences, as well
as on false ones: if \(\phi\) is true (false) in \(M\), then both
\({\sim}\phi\) and \(\neg \phi\) are false (true) in \(M\). By contrast, if
\(\phi\) is non-determined in \(M\), then \({\sim}\phi\) is non-determined
as well, but \(\neg \phi\) is true. The combination \(\neg{\sim}\) of the two
negations applied to a sentence \(\phi\) asserts that \(\phi\) is not
 false.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-66" id="ref-66">66</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
The propositional part of \(\mathbf{EIFL}\) involves the four
operators \(\neg , {\sim}, \wedge\), and \(\vee\). Hintikka (2004b) raises the
question of the algebraic structure induced by these operators, when
any two truth equivalent sentences are identified. The operators
\(\neg , \wedge\), and \(\vee\) give rise to a Boolean algebra &ndash; but what
does the strong negation \({\sim}\) add to this structure? </p>

<p>
Restricting attention to truth equivalence, \({\sim}\) is definable from the
operators \(\neg\) and \(\neg{\sim}\). For, \({\sim}\phi\) is true in \(M\) iff
\(\neg(\neg{\sim}\phi)\) is true in \(M\). Instead of \({\sim}\), the operator
\(\neg{\sim}\) may then be considered. Hintikka points out that the
propositional part of \(\mathbf{EIFL}\) (formulated in terms of
the operators \(\vee , \wedge , \neg\) and \(\neg{\sim})\) is a Boolean algebra with
an operator in the sense of J&oacute;nsson &amp; Tarski (1951). The
additional operator \(\neg{\sim}\) is a closure operator. </p>

<p>
J&oacute;nsson and Tarski (1951, Thm. 3.14) showed that any closure
algebra is isomorphic to an algebraic system formed by a set equipped
with a reflexive and transitive
 relation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-67" id="ref-67">67</a>]</sup>
 As a matter of fact, the relevant algebraic structure is precisely
that of the propositional modal logic \(\mathbf{S4}\). Hence the
propositional part of \(\mathbf{EIFL}\) has the same algebraic
structure as \(\mathbf{S4}\). By a well-known result due to
G&ouml;del (1933) and McKinsey &amp; Tarski (1948), intuitionistic
propositional logic can be interpreted in \(\mathbf{S4}\), via a
translation \(t\) such that \(\phi\) is intuitionistically provable
iff \(t(\phi)\) is a valid \(\mathbf{S4}\) formula. Thus,
intuitionistic propositional logic is interpretable in
 \(\mathbf{EIFL}\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-68" id="ref-68">68</a>]</sup></p>
 

<h2><a name="PhiCon">5. Philosophical Consequences</a></h2>

<p>
Hintikka (2006a: 73&ndash;77) takes the following to be among
consequences of the novel insights made possible by (extended) IF
first-order logic: reconstruction of normal mathematical reasoning on
the first-order level, a novel perspective on the notion of truth in
axiomatic set theory, insights into the nature of negation, and the
formulation of a self-applied truth-predicate. A related topic of
general interest is the phenomenon of informational independence in
natural languages. The ideas related to negation and definability of
truth have been discussed in <em>Subsections</em> 4.2 and 4.5,
respectively. Let us consider here the remaining issues.</p>

<h3><a name="PlaTypHie">5.1 Place in type hierarchy</a></h3>

<p>
Hintikka maintains that the only reasonable way of making a
distinction between first-order logic and higher-order logic is by
reference to the entities that one&rsquo;s quantified variables range
over. A first-order logic is, then, a logic in which all quantifiers
range over individuals, in contrast to higher-order entities
(<em>e.g.</em>, subsets of the domain). On this basis Hintikka holds
that substantially speaking, \(\mathbf{IFL}\) and even
\(\mathbf{EIFL}\) are <em>first-order</em>
 logics.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-69" id="ref-69">69</a>]</sup>
 Solomon Feferman (2006: 457&ndash;461) criticizes the criterion that
Hintikka employs for judging the first-order status of a logic.
Feferman makes use of generalized quantifiers in his
 argument.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-70" id="ref-70">70</a>]</sup>
 The formulas </p>

\[
Q[z_1] \ldots [z_k] (\phi_1 ,\ldots ,\phi_k)
\]

<p>
involving generalized quantifiers are <em>syntactically
first-order</em>, insofar as the quantified variables \(z_{i1},\ldots
,z_{in_i} = [z_i]\) are first-order \((1 \le i \le k)\). The semantics
of a generalized quantifier \(Q\) is formulated by associating with
each domain M a \(k\)-ary relation \(Q_M\) on M, with \(Q_M
\subseteq\) M\(^{n_1} \times \ldots \times\)
M\(^{n_k}\). <em>E.g.</em>, for any infinite cardinal \(\kappa\),
there is a generalized quantifier \(Q_{\ge \kappa}\) such that
\(Q_{\ge \kappa}z P(z)\) is true in a model \(M\) iff there are at
least \(\kappa\) elements that satisfy the predicate \(P\). Hence
generalized quantifiers can be <em>semantically higher-order</em>. The
fact that the variables in a formula range over individuals only, does
not offer a reliable criterion for the logic&rsquo;s first-order
status. </p>

<p>
Hintikka&rsquo;s criterion could be reformulated by saying that a
logic is of first order, if any <em>play</em> of a semantic game
associated with a formula of this logic only involves (in addition to
choices interpreting conjunctions and disjunctions) choices of
individuals, as opposed to choices of higher-order entities. By this
criterion \(\mathbf{IFL}\) (and even \(\mathbf{EIFL})\) are
first-order logics, but the logic of generalized quantifiers such as
\(Q_{\ge \kappa}\) is
 not.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-71" id="ref-71">71</a>]</sup>
 Feferman (2006: 461) anticipates the possibility of such a reply, but
finds it unconvincing.</p>

<p>
By a result of Hintikka (1955), the problem of deciding whether a
sentence of second-order logic is valid can be effectively reduced to
the validity problem of
 \(\mathbf{IFL}\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-72" id="ref-72">72</a>]</sup>
 V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen (2001) has shown that the set of valid
sentences of \(\mathbf{IFL}\) has the same very high complexity as
the set of validities of the full second-order
 logic.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-73" id="ref-73">73</a>]</sup>
 V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen (2001) and Feferman (2006) conclude that
speaking of validity in \(\mathbf{IFL}\) leads to a strong
commitment to full second-order logic. Hintikka (2006a: 476&ndash;477)
looks at these results from the opposite direction: for him they mean
that indeed one can speak of validity in full second-order logic in
terms of validity in \(\mathbf{IFL}\). What is more, Hintikka
(1997) affirms that even \(\mathbf{EIFL}\) is a first-order logic.
If so, any mathematical theory that can be expressed by the truth of
an \(\mathbf{EIFL}\) sentence is likewise free from problems of
set existence. </p>

<p>
Hintikka&rsquo;s position leads to a puzzle. If \(\phi\) is a sentence of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) not truth equivalent to any \(\mathbf{FO}\)
sentence, the truth-condition of the sentence \(\neg \phi\) of
\(\mathbf{EIFL}\) cannot be formulated without recourse to the set
of all strategies of player 2: \(\neg \phi\) is true in model \(M\)
iff for all strategies of player 2 in game \(G(\phi ,
M)\), there is a sequence of moves by player 1 such that player
1 wins the resulting play. The set of all strategies of player 2 is
undeniably a higher-order entity. How can commitment to entities other
than individuals be said to have been avoided here? Can the meaning of
the sentence \(\neg \phi\) be well understood without presupposing the
genuinely second-order idea of all strategies of a given
 player?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-74" id="ref-74">74</a>]</sup>
 Rather than being nominalistic, Hintikka&rsquo;s position appears to
be a variant of <em>universalia in rebus</em>. While rules of semantic
games pertain to actions performed on first-order objects,
combinatorial properties of sets of plays can only be formulated in
second-order terms. As soon as game rules are defined for a language
fragment, also the corresponding combinatorial properties are fully
determined, among them the properties labeled as truth and
falsity.</p>

<h3><a name="SetThe">5.2 Philosophy of set theory</a></h3>

<p>
According to Hintikka, our pretheoretical idea of the truth of a
quantified sentence \(\phi\) (in negation normal form) is that there
exist &lsquo;witness individuals&rsquo; for the existential
quantifiers, usually depending on values corresponding to the
preceding universal
 quantifiers.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-75" id="ref-75">75</a>]</sup>
 It is the existence of such witnesses that constitutes the truth of
\(\phi\). Providing witnesses is precisely what Skolem functions for
\(\phi\)
 do.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-76" id="ref-76">76</a>]</sup>
 The truth of a quantified sentence \(\phi\) amounts to the existence of
a full set of Skolem functions for \(\phi\). In Hintikka&rsquo;s view,
then, our ordinary notion of first-order truth is conceptualized in
terms of (existential) second-order logic. What happens when this idea
is applied to axiomatic set theory, say Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory
with the Axiom of Choice \((\mathbf{ZFC})\)? It should be born in
mind that the very idea of axiomatic set theory is to dispense with
higher-order logic; its underlying logic is taken to be
\(\mathbf{FO}\). Hintikka argues as
 follows.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-77" id="ref-77">77</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
For each sentence \(\phi\) of \(\mathbf{ZFC}\), there is another
sentence \(\phi^* = (\exists f_1)\ldots(\exists f_n)\psi^*\)
of \(\mathbf{ZFC}\) which says, intuitively, that &lsquo;Skolem
functions&rsquo; for \(\phi\) exist. These &lsquo;Skolem functions&rsquo;
are certain individuals of the domain of a model of
\(\mathbf{ZFC}\). Here both \(\phi^*\) and \(\phi\) are first-order
sentences. But if for every sentence \(\phi\) of \(\mathbf{ZFC}\) we
have \(\phi\) and \(\phi^*\) being logically equivalent, why could the
sentences \(\phi^*\) not be used for formulating a truth-predicate for
\(\mathbf{ZFC}\) in \(\mathbf{ZFC}\) itself? However, by
Tarski&rsquo;s undefinability result, no such truth-predicate
 exists.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-78" id="ref-78">78</a>]</sup>
 So there must be a model of \(\mathbf{ZFC}\) and a sentence \(\phi\)
true in that model such that \(\phi^*\) is false: not all &lsquo;Skolem
functions&rsquo; asserted to exist by \(\phi^*\) actually exist in the
model. </p>

<p>
This reasoning shows that \(\mathbf{ZFC}\) does not fully capture the
idea of truth according to which the truth of a sentence \(\phi\)
means that the Skolem functions for \(\phi\) exist. Furthermore, it
also shows that the standard interpretation of higher-order logic is
not fully captured by \(\mathbf{ZFC}\). To see this, observe that for
every sentence \(\phi\) there is a logically equivalent
<em>second-order</em> sentence \(\phi^{**} = (\exists
F_1)\ldots(\exists F_n)\psi^{**}\) actually asserting the existence of
Skolem functions for \(\phi\). The <em>first-order</em> sentence
\(\phi^* = (\exists f_1)\ldots(\exists f_n)\psi^*\) must not be
confused with the second-order sentence \(\phi^{**} = (\exists
F_1)\ldots(\exists F_n)\psi^{**}\).  The Skolem functions \(F_i\) of
which the sentence \(\phi^{**}\) speaks are <em>sets</em> built out of
individuals of the set-theoretical universe, while the &lsquo;Skolem
functions&rsquo; \(f_i\) spoken of by \(\phi^*\) are
 <em>individuals</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-79" id="ref-79">79</a>]</sup></p>
 

<p>
The conclusion of Hintikka&rsquo;s argument is that our ordinary
notion of truth is misrepresented by \(\mathbf{ZFC}\).
Furthermore, by Tarski&rsquo;s undefinability result the situation
cannot be improved by adding further axioms to \(\mathbf{ZFC}\).
In Hintikka&rsquo;s judgment, axiomatic set theory is a systematic but
futile attempt to capture on the first-order level truths of
standardly interpreted second-order logic. Like G&ouml;del (1947),
also Hintikka holds that the concepts needed to state, say, the
continuum hypothesis are sufficiently well-defined to determine the
truth-value of this conjecture. The continuum hypothesis does not
receive its meaning from phrasing it in \(\mathbf{ZFC}\).
G&ouml;del and Hintikka agree that the independence results due to
G&ouml;del himself and Paul Cohen do not by themselves show anything
about the truth or falsity of the continuum hypothesis. But unlike
G&ouml;del, Hintikka finds the derivability of any conjecture whatever
in \(\mathbf{ZFC}\) (or in any of its extensions) simply
irrelevant for the truth of the conjecture. For Hintikka, it is a
&lsquo;combinatorial&rsquo; question whether every infinite subset of
the reals is either countable or else has the cardinality of the set
of all reals &ndash; a question properly conceptualized within
second-order logic. This is what Hintikka takes to be the
pretheoretical sense of the truth of the continuum hypothesis, and
that is not captured by
 \(\mathbf{ZFC}\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-80" id="ref-80">80</a>]</sup>

Hintikka sees \(\mathbf{EIFL}\) as allowing to reconstruct all
normal mathematical reasoning on the first-order level. This result is
essentially dependent on the acceptability of Hintikka&rsquo;s claim
that \(\mathbf{EIFL}\) is ontologically committed to individuals
only (<em>Subsect.</em> 5.1). But how would \(\mathbf{EIFL}\)
serve to reconstruct an important part of all mathematical
reasoning?</p>

<p>
Hintikka (1996: 194&ndash;210) discusses mathematical
<em>theories</em> (or mathematical axiomatizations) and mathematical
<em>problems</em> (or questions of logical consequence)
separately.</p>

<p>
Any higher-order <em>mathematical theory</em> \(T\) gives rise to
a many-sorted first-order theory \(T^*\). If the theory is finite,
there is a finite conjunction \(J\) formulated in
\(\mathbf{EIFL}\) (equivalent to the contradictory negation of an
\(\mathbf{ESO}\) sentence) expressing the requirement that the
standard interpretation of higher-order logic is respected. The
question of the truth of the higher-order theory \(T\) is thus
reduced to the truth of the sentence \((T^* \wedge J)\) of
\(\mathbf{EIFL}\) (cf. <em>Subsect.</em> 4.6). </p>

<p>
The <em>mathematical problem</em> of whether a given sentence
\(C\) is a logical consequence of a finite higher-order theory
\(T\) coincides with the problem of whether the second-order
sentence \((\neg(T^* \wedge J) \vee C^*)\) is
valid. Recalling that there is a sentence \(\chi\) of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) such that \(J\) is equivalent to \(\neg \chi\),
it follows that \(\neg(T^* \wedge J)\) is equivalent to a
sentence of \(\mathbf{IFL}\). Consequently there is a sentence of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) which is valid iff the sentence
\((\neg(T^* \wedge J) \vee C^*)\) is valid (cf.
<em>Subsect.</em> 4.6). Mathematical problems can be understood as
questions of the <em>validity</em> of an \(\mathbf{IFL}\)
sentence. Among mathematical problems thus reconstructible using
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) are the continuum hypothesis, Goldbach&rsquo;s
conjecture, Souslin&rsquo;s conjecture, the existence of an
inaccessible cardinal, and the existence of a measurable
 cardinal.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-81" id="ref-81">81</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
As conceptualizations apparently transcending the proposed framework
&ndash; not expressible in a higher-order logic &ndash; Hintikka
considers the maximality assumption expressed by David Hilbert&rsquo;s
so-called axiom of completeness. The axiom says that no mathematical
objects can be added to the intended models without violating the
other
 axioms.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-82" id="ref-82">82</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
If indeed problems related to the idea of <em>all subsets</em> are
avoided in \(\mathbf{EIFL}\) (Hintikka 1997), it offers a way of
defending a certain form logicism. Unlike in historical logicism, the
idea is not to consider logic as an axiom system on the same level as
mathematical axiom systems (Hintikka 1996:
 183),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-83" id="ref-83">83</a>]</sup>
 and to attempt to reduce mathematics to logic. Rather, Hintikka
(1996: 184) proposes to ask: <strong>(a)</strong> Can the crucial
mathematical concepts be defined in logical terms?
<strong>(b)</strong> Can the modes of semantically valid logical
inferences used in mathematics be expressed in logical terms? The idea
is not to concentrate on deductive rules of logic: no complete set of
deductive rules exist anyway for \(\mathbf{IFL}\). Because the
status of higher-order logic is potentially dubious &ndash; due to the
problems associated with the notion of powerset &ndash; a positive
solution to questions (a) and (b) calls for a first-order logic more
powerful than \(\mathbf{FO}\). </p>

<p>
The suggested reduction of all mathematics expressible in higher-order
logic to the first-order level would be philosophically significant in
showing that mathematics is not a study of general concepts, but of
structures consisting of particulars (Hintikka 1996: 207). This is not
to say that actual mathematics would be best carried out in terms of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\), only that it could in principle be so carried
out (Hintikka 1996: 205, 2006a: 477). For a critique of
Hintikka&rsquo;s conclusions, see V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen (2001),
Feferman (2006).</p>

<h3><a name="InfIndNatLan">5.4 Informational independence in natural languages</a></h3>

<p>
When Hintikka began to apply GTS to the study of natural language
(Hintikka 1973a), he took up the question of whether branching
quantifiers occur in natural languages. He was led to ask whether
there are semantic games with imperfect information. He detected
various types of grammatical constructions in English that involve
informational
 independence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-84" id="ref-84">84</a>]</sup>
 An often cited example is the sentence </p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Some relative of each villager and some relative of each townsman
hate each other</em>,
</p>

<p>
true under its relevant reading when the choice of a relative of each
townsman can be made independently of the individual chosen for
&lsquo;each
 villager.&rsquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-85" id="ref-85">85</a>]</sup>
 Hintikka (1973a) sketched an argument to the effect that actually
every \(\mathbf{FPO}\) sentence can be reproduced as a
representation of an English sentence. From this it would follow that
the logic of idiomatic English quantifiers is much stronger than
\(\mathbf{FO}\), and that no effective procedure exists for
classifying sentences as analytical or nonanalytical, synonymous or
 nonsynonymous.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-86" id="ref-86">86</a>]</sup>
 This would be methodologically a very important result, showing that
syntactic methods are even in principle insufficient in linguistic
theorizing. Jon Barwise (1979) suggested that particularly convincing
examples supporting Hintikka&rsquo;s thesis can be given in terms of
generalized quantifiers. </p>

<p>
Lauri Carlson and Alice ter Meulen (1979) were the first to observe
cases of informational independence between quantifiers and
intensional operators. Consider the
 question<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-87" id="ref-87">87</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p class="indent">
<em>Who does everybody admire?</em>
</p>

<p>
Under one of its readings, the presupposition of this question is
\((\forall x)(\exists y)\) admires\((x,
y)\). The desideratum of this question is </p>

<p class="indent">
<em>I know who everybody admires.</em>
</p>

<p>
Writing &lsquo;\(K_I\)&rsquo; for &lsquo;I
 know,&rsquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-88" id="ref-88">88</a>]</sup>
 the desideratum has a reading whose logical form is </p>

<p class="indent">
\(K_I (\forall x)(\exists y/K_I)\) admires\((x, y)\).
</p>

<p>
This desireratum is satisfied by an answer pointing out a function
\(f\) which yields for each person a suitable admired person.
Such a function can be <em>his or her father</em>. Importantly, the
value \(f(b)\) of this function only depends on the
person \(b\) interpreting &lsquo;everybody,&rsquo; but does not
depend on the scenario \(w\), compatible with the
questioner&rsquo;s knowledge, that interprets the construction
&lsquo;I know.&rsquo; Interestingly, the desideratum
\(K_I 
(\forall x)(\exists y/K_I)\)
admires\((x, y)\) is not expressible without an explicit
independence indicator. It is also worth noting that this case cannot
be represented in the notation of \(\mathbf{FPO}\). This is
because several types of semantic interactions are possible among
quantifiers and intensional operators, and blocking interactions of
one type does not automatically block interactions of other types. In
the example, the witness of \(\exists y\) must not vary with the
scenario \(w\) interpreting the operator
\(K_I\), but still the values of both
variables \(x\) and \(y\) must belong to the domain of the
particular scenario \(w\) chosen to interpret
 \(K_I\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-89" id="ref-89">89</a>]</sup></p>
 

<p>
Hintikka&rsquo;s ideas on desiderata of wh-questions were influenced
by his exchange with the linguist Elisabet
 Engdahl.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-90" id="ref-90">90</a>]</sup>
 These wh-questions, again, functioned as important test cases for the
appearance of informational independence in natural languages. </p>

<p>
Hintikka and Sandu (1989) took up the task of formulating an explicit
unified formal treatment for the different varieties of informational
independence in natural language semantics. They posed the question of
which are the mechanisms that allow English to exceed the expressive
power of \(\mathbf{FO}\). For, natural languages typically do not
resort to higher-order quantifiers. Hintikka and Sandu suggested that
informational independence plays a key role in increasing the
expressive power of natural
 languages.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-91" id="ref-91">91</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In GTS as developed for English in Hintikka &amp; Kulas (1983, 1985),
game rules are associated with a great variety of linguistic
expressions (cf. <em>Subsect.</em> 2.1). As Hintikka (1990) has
stressed, informational independence is a cross-categorical
phenomenon: it can occur in connection with expressions of widely
different grammatical categories. Hintikka and Sandu (1989) propose
several examples from English calculated to show that there is an
abundance of instances of informational independence in natural
languages. Among examples are wh-questions of the kind discussed
above, and the distinction between the <em>de dicto</em> and <em>de
re</em> readings of certain English sentences. Hintikka and Sandu
suggest that representing such readings in terms of IF logic is more
truthful to the syntax of English than the alternative, non-IF
representations are. </p> 

<p>In connection with knowledge, a <em>de
dicto</em> attribution such as</p>

<p class="indent">
\(K_{\textit{Ralph}} (\exists x) (x\) is a spy)
</p>

<p>
can be turned into a <em>de re</em> attribution by marking the
existential quantifier as independent of the knowledge-operator (cf.
Hintikka and Sandu 1989):</p>

<p class="indent">
\(K_{\textit{Ralph}} (\exists x/K_{\textit{Ralph}}) (x\) is a spy).
</p>

<p>
Because knowledge is a factive attitude (the actual world is among
Ralph&rsquo;s epistemic alternatives), this amounts indeed to the same
as the condition</p>

<p class="indent">
\((\exists x) K_{\textit{Ralph}} (x\) is a spy).
</p>

<p>
Rebuschi &amp; Tulenheimo (2011) observed that independent quantifiers
are of special interest in connection with non-factive attitudes such
as belief. The logical form of a statement ascribing to Ralph a belief
pertaining to a specific but non-existent object is </p>

<p class="indent">
\(B_{\textit{Ralph}} (\exists x/B_{\textit{Ralph}}) (x\) is a spy),
</p>

<p>
where &lsquo;\(B_{\textit{Ralph}}\)&rsquo; stands for
&lsquo;Ralph believes
 that.&rsquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-92" id="ref-92">92</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Attitudes of this form were dubbed <em>de objecto</em> attitudes.
Since the (intentional) object of such an attitude need not exist
actually, the <em>de objecto</em> attitude is weaker than the <em>de
re</em> attitude</p>

<p class="indent">
\((\exists x) B_{\textit{Ralph}} (x\) is a spy).
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the pattern of operators \(B_{\textit{Ralph}}
(\exists x/B_{\textit{Ralph}})\) requires that the witness of the
existential quantifier \(\exists x\) be the same relative to all
doxastic alternatives of Ralph, so the <em>de objecto</em> attitude is
stronger than the <em>de dicto</em> attitude</p>

<p class="indent">
\(B_{\textit{Ralph}} (\exists x) (x\) is a spy).
</p>

<p>
Janssen (2013) discusses the possibility of providing in terms of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) a compositional analysis of the <em>de re</em> /
<em>de dicto</em> ambiguity in natural languages. Brasoveanu and
Farkas (2011) argue that scopal properties of natural language
indefinites are best elucidated in terms of a semantics inspired by
\(\mathbf{IFL}\), more precisely by formulating the semantics
relative to sets of variable assignments as done in Hodges&rsquo;s
compositional semantics for slash logic. </p>

<p>
As a rule, informational independence is not indicated syntactically
in
 English.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-93" id="ref-93">93</a>]</sup>
 Methodological consequences of this fact are discussed in Hintikka
(1990), where he tentatively puts forward the <em>Syntactic Silence
Thesis</em>, according to which sufficiently radical cross-categorical
phenomena are not likely to be marked syntactically in natural
languages. Evidence for this thesis would, for its part, be evidence
against the sufficiency of syntax-oriented approaches to
semantics.</p>

<h2><a name="RelLog">6. Related logics</a></h2>

<h3><a name="SlaLog">6.1 Slash logic</a></h3>

<p>
Syntatically slash logic uses quantifiers like
\((\exists x/y)\) instead of quantifiers such as
\((\exists x/\forall y)\). Semantically slash logic is
otherwise like \(\mathbf{IFL}\) except that its game-theoretical
semantics is based on the idea that a player&rsquo;s strategy
functions may utilize as their arguments <em>any</em> preceding moves
made in the current play, save for those whose use is, by the slash
notation, explicitly indicated as forbidden (cf. <em>Sect.</em> 3).
That is, also a player&rsquo;s own earlier moves may appear as
arguments of a strategy function. This can make a difference in the
presence of imperfect information. For example, consider evaluating
the slash-logic sentence
\((\forall x)(\exists y)(\exists z/x)
x = z\) containing the vacuous quantifier
\(\exists y\). This sentence is true on a two-element domain,
since player 2 can copy as the value of \(y\) the value that
player 1 has chosen for \(x\), and then select the value of
\(z\) using a strategy function whose only argument is the value
of \(y\). (For this phenomenon of &lsquo;signaling,&rsquo; see
Hodges 1997a, Sandu 2001, Janssen &amp; Dechesne 2006, Barbero 2013.)
By contrast, the IF sentence
\((\forall x)(\exists y)(\exists z/\forall x)
x = z\) fails to be true on such a domain, since there
a strategy function for \((\exists z/\forall x)\) must be
a constant, and no such strategy function can guarantee a win for
player 2 against both possible values that player 1 can choose for
\(x\). As mentioned in <em>Subsection</em> 4.4, Hodges (1997a,b)
showed that slash logic admits of an alternative, compositional
semantics. This requires evaluating formulas relative to sets of
variable assignments, instead of single assignments as in connection
with \(\mathbf{FO}\). Hodges (1997a,b) and Figueira <em>et
al.</em> (2009, 2011) discuss an extension of slash logic in which the
contradictory negation of slash logic sentences can be expressed.</p>

<h3><a name="DepLog">6.2 Dependence logic</a></h3>

<p>
Jouko V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen (2007) formulated a new approach to IF
logic that he dubbed <em>dependence logic</em> \((\mathbf{DL})\);
for further work on \(\mathbf{DL}\), see <em>e.g.</em> Kontinen
<em>et al.</em> (2013). The syntax of \(\mathbf{DL}\) is obtained
from that of \(\mathbf{FO}\) by allowing atomic formulas of the
following special form: </p>

\[
=(x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n; x_{n+1}).
\]

<p>
Intuitively such a formula means that the value of \(x_{n+1}\) depends
only on the values of \(x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n\). The semantics of
\(\mathbf{DL}\) cannot be formulated relative to single variable
assignments like that of \(\mathbf{FO}\): we cannot explicate what it
means for the value of \(x_{n+1}\) to depend on those of \(x_1 ,\ldots
,x_n\) with reference to a single assignment on the variables \(x_1
,\ldots ,x_{n+1}\).  For example, consider the assignment described
below: </p>

<table class="hrules cellpad-med-dense centered">
<tr>
 <td>\(x_1\)</td>
 <td>\(x_2\)</td>
 <td>\(x_3\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>7</td>
 <td>5</td>
 <td>8</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Relative to this assignment, all of the following claims hold:
whenever the value of \(x_1\) equals 7, the value of \(x_3\) equals 8;
whenever the value of \(x_2\) equals 5, the value of \(x_3\) equals 8;
whenever the value of \(x_1\) equals 7 and the value of \(x_2\) equals
5, the value of \(x_3\) equals 8; irrespective of the values of
\(x_1\) and \(x_2\), the value of \(x_3\) equals 8. The question of
dependence only becomes interesting and non-vacuous relative to a set
of assignments:</p>

<table class="hrules cellpad-med-dense centered">
<tr>
 <td>\(x_1\)</td>
 <td>\(x_2\)</td>
 <td>\(x_3\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>7</td>
 <td>5</td>
 <td>8</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>9</td>
 <td>5</td>
 <td>6</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>7</td>
 <td>11</td>
 <td>8</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>7</td>
 <td>3</td>
 <td>8</td> </tr>
<tr>
 <td>9</td>
 <td>19</td>
 <td>6</td> </tr>
</table>


<p>
The set \(X\) consisting of the above five assignments satisfies
the formula \(=(x_1\); \(x_3)\): the
value of \(x_3\) depends only on the value of
\(x_1\). As is readily observed, any two assignments in
\(X\) which assign the same value to \(x_1\)
assign also the same value to \(x_3\). The interesting
novelty of \(\mathbf{DL}\) is that claims about variable
dependencies are made at the atomic level. Quantifiers of
\(\mathbf{IFL}\) and those of slash logic with their independence
indications easily lead to somewhat messy formulas, whereas
\(\mathbf{DL}\) looks exactly like \(\mathbf{FO}\), apart from
its greater flexibility in forms of atomic formulas.</p>

<h2><a name="Con">7. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
In this entry IF first-order logic and extended IF first-order logic
have been surveyed. Their metalogical properties have been explained
and the philosophical relevance of these properties has been
discussed. The suggested consequences of these logics for
philosophical issues such as the existence of a self-applied
truth-predicate, the logicist program, the philosophical relevance of
axiomatic set theory, and informational independence in natural
languages have been covered as well. Slash logic and dependence logic
&ndash; both closely related to \(\mathbf{IFL}\) and inspired by
it &ndash; were also briefly considered.</p>

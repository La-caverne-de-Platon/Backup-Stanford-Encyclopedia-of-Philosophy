<h2>Andronicus of Rhodes</h2>

<p>

Andronicus is traditionally credited with the production of the first
reliable edition of Aristotle.</p>

<p>

Unfortunately, it is not clear what Andronicus edited and how he did
it. His reputation as an editor of Aristotle entirely rests on the
testimony of Porphyry, who tells us that &ldquo;Andronicus divided the
works of Aristotle and Theophrastus into treatises, collecting related
material into the same place&rdquo; (Porphyry, <em>Life of
Plotinus,</em> chapter 24). What is clear is that Andronicus <em>did
not</em> provide an authoritative text of Aristotle. Indirect evidence
of the absence of such a text is the discussion of alternative textual
readings in the subsequent commentary tradition. This discussion
suggests that Aristotle&rsquo;s text remained fluid at least until the
end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> century CE. (For helpful comments on this
point, see Hatzimichali 2016: 81&ndash;100, especially
94&ndash;99).</p>

<p> Following a recent trend in scholarship, we may want to keep
Andronicus&rsquo; activities of textual criticism and canon or
corpus&ndash;organization separate (Hatzimichali 2013: 2&ndash;17 and
Hatzimichali 2016: 81&ndash;100). The most important result of this
separation is a shift away from his putative edition of Aristotle with
a concentration on his activity as organizer of the Aristotelian
corpus. Let us review, briefly, what we know about this activity.</p>

<p>

We know that Andronicus wrote a catalogue (<em>pinakes</em>) of
Aristotle&rsquo;s writings. This catalogue was in at least five books
and was more than just a list of titles. Among other things, it
contained also a biography of Aristotle, a transcription of his will,
a collection of letters attributed to Aristotle, and a set of notes
where Andronicus presumably explained and defended the organization of
his catalogue and discussed various issues, including the authenticity
of some of the works ascribed to Aristotle. For instance, we know that
Andronicus regarded the work <em>On Interpretation</em> (<em>De
interpretatione</em>) as spurious. We can safely assume that he
discussed his reasons for this view in the context of his
<em>pinakes</em>.</p>

<p> The catalogue produced by Andronicus is not extant, but scholars
have traditionally invoked the extant catalogue of Ptolemy
al-Ghar&icirc;b, &ldquo;the unknown&rdquo; or &ldquo;the
stranger&rdquo;, for an idea on its contents. The Greek original of
this second catalogue is also lost. However, its contents are
transmitted by two indirect witnesses (Ibn al Qift&icirc; and Ibn
ab&icirc; Usaibi&lsquo;a) and two Arabic manuscripts. A critical
edition of this important document is now available (Rashed 2021). In
addition to a critical edition of the Arabic text, Marwan Rashed has
also produced a French translation plus an in-depth study of its four
parts. They are: (1) a prologue where Ptolemy explains the aims of his
work, (2) a biography of Aristotle, (3) Aristotle&rsquo;s will, and
(4) a list of Aristotle&rsquo;s writings.</p>

<p>
From the prologue we learn that Ptolemy&rsquo;s catalogue was written
upon the request of an otherwise unknown Gallus, who had an interest in
Aristotle but was not able (or willing) to engage in the study of the
<em>pinakes</em> produced by Andronicus. As a result, Ptolemy produced
his own shorter catalogue, which is addressed to Gallus (<em>Ad
Gallum</em>). While shorter, this catalogue need not be an abridgement
of the work produced by Andronicus. Marwan Rashed has argued&mdash;convincingly, in my view&mdash;that Ptolemy did not follow Andronicus and his
<em>pinakes</em>. Rather, he relied on a previous (Hellenistic)
tradition, which may be identical with the <em>pinakes</em> produced
by Hermippus of Smyrna (3<sup>rd</sup> century BCE) (Rashed 2021:
xx-xxviii combined with ccxcviii-cccii) This has an important (though
negative) consequence for us: we cannot (and, indeed, should not) use
Ptolemy&rsquo;s catalogue to try to shed light on what Andronicus may
have accomplished. But this also means that we have to accept that we
know very little (almost nothing) about Andronicus&rsquo;
<em>pinakes</em></p>

<p>
Among other things, we do not know <em>when</em> and <em>where</em>
Andronicus produced his <em>pinakes</em>. The two most recent
contributions on this point (Perkams 2019: 445&ndash;468, and Rashed
2021: ccciii&ndash;ccclxv) have placed a great deal of confidence on a
notice on the life and work of Andronicus that goes back to
al-F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s <em>On the Appearance of
Philosophy</em> (preserved only in Ibn Ab&icirc;
&lsquo;Usaibi&lsquo;a). This notice tells us that Andronicus worked in
Alexandria, and that he followed Augustus from Alexandria to Rome
(after the battle of Atium in 31 BCE), where he also completed his
<em>pinakes</em>. The notice also ascribes an active role to Augustus, who
interested himself in the Alexandrian library and in Aristotle&rsquo;s
books and teaching.</p>

<p> This notice is part of
a highly fictionalized account of the transmission of philosophy from
the Greeks through the Romans to the Christians (Syrians) and the
Arabs. Scholars have known it for a long time. The question has always been&mdash;and still is&mdash;whether (and
eventually how) we can separate reality from fiction in this
notice. Put differently, the notice may preserve some historical
information&mdash;maybe even information we do not find
elsewhere&mdash;, but it is also likely to be filled with opportunities for confusion and corruption. For
instance, it is hard to resist the thought that the name of Augustus
stands for that of Sulla and the story of the transfer of the books
from Alexandria to Rome stands the story of the transfer of the books
from Athens to Rome after Sulla&rsquo;s sack of Athens.</p>

<p>
In sum, I remain skeptical that we can penetrate the darkness
surrounding the activity of Andronicus of Rhodes. There is, however, no
doubt that the most significant and lasting influence of Andronicus
was as organizer of the Aristotelian corpus. He imposed
a certain order on this corpus. For instance, he placed the logical
writings at the outset of his catalogue and the <em>Categories</em> at
the head of the logical writings. The prominent position given to the
<em>Categories</em> in the Andronican corpus may have played a
significant role in the post-Hellenistic surge of interest in this
work (as suggested by Michael Griffin in Griffin 2015). </p>

<p>

Without denying that the Andronican catalogue played a significant
role in the Post-Hellenistic return to Aristotle, it remains difficult
to trace all the Post-Hellenistic interest in the <em>Categories</em>,
and the various readings it generated, back to Andronicus and his
decision to place the <em>Categories</em> at the outset of his
catalogue. For one thing, there is little but clear evidence of an
interest in <em>Categories</em> before Andronicus. Quite tellingly,
Andronicus criticized an unknown predecessor who argued that the
<em>Categories</em> was written for the sake of the <em>Topics</em>
and hence should be entitled <em>Before the Topics</em>. For another,
a significant philosopher such as Eudorus of Alexandria, who was
active in the middle of the the 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE, may have
developed his interest in the <em>Categories</em> independently of
Andronicus and for completely different reasons (See Falcon 2018).</p>

<p>
The truth is that the information in our possession is frustratingly
scarce. We know too little about Andronicus, Eudorus, and the other
philosophers active in the 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE. In some cases,
we have no precise dates for their activity. In the end, we must
remain mindful of the limits of what can be confidently said by us on
state of philosophy in the 1<sup>st</sup> century BCE.</p>

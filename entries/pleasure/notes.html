 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1" id="note-1">1.</a>
<strong>This very long note defends its
inclusive use of &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; and &ldquo;pain&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; and</strong>
the naturalness of the prima facie distinction thereby drawn. It also
<strong>distinguishes such uses from others</strong>. This use of
&ldquo;pain&rdquo; is discussed in the paragraph just below, the distinction between sensation and affect salient there in the next, and
the substantive contrast between pain and pleasure in the two following.
The remainder of the note (flagged by a brief
introductory paragraph) discusses the wide cultural and historical
currency of inclusive usage of &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; and semantically similar terms, distinguishes other uses, and ends
with three paragraphs discussing the rejection of the inclusive use
and concept by some &lsquo;ordinary language philosophers&rsquo; of
the mid-twentieth century. Throughout a broader linguistic and cultural
perspective is attempted, in contrast to their practice of drawing
universal conclusions about pleasure
exclusively from their intuitions about current English usage, in keeping
with then-current British philosophical fashion, although these writers
typically had broader linguistic evidence ready to hand.</p>

<p>

<strong>Inclusive affective use of &ldquo;pain&rdquo;, contrasting with
inclusive use of &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;</strong>, is old in English (probably
as old as the narrow use for pain sensation [<em>OED, ad loc.</em>]),
however metaphorical it may seem now. No alternative has
enduringly replaced &ldquo;pain&rdquo; in this everyday use; it is,
however, often helpful to alternate &ldquo;suffering&rdquo; or
&ldquo;distress&rdquo; with it, to make clear the shared meaning one
intends. As Locke&rsquo;s similar supplementary use of
&ldquo;uneasiness&rdquo; (n.&nbsp;2 below) shows, this problem is
nothing new. (It has led some to prefer Hobbes&rsquo; now-obsolete use of
&ldquo;displeasure&rdquo; [e.g., Schroeder 2004]&nbsp;&ndash; or
even the nineteenth century coinage &ldquo;unpleasure&rdquo;,
imitating the use of &ldquo;<em>Unlust</em>&rdquo; in
 German [defended as the only English opposite of
&ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; in Rachels 2004]. Both are unidiomatic in
living English and further seem to controversially [see two paragraphs
down] prejudge that affective pain is really related to pleasure as
its contrary or polar opposite.)  Common speech aside, there is a
history of similarly inclusive usage in a longstanding and continuing
theoretical discourse, beginning in ancient Greek and
Latin. &ldquo;Pleasure&rdquo; and &ldquo;pain&rdquo; have long been
the established English translations used in continuing this discourse. Thomas Aquinas
relevantly distinguishes between two uses
of the Latin &ldquo;<em>dolor</em>&rdquo;, a narrow one restricted to
bodily pain and an inclusive one covering thought-mediated
sorrow (&ldquo;<em>tristitia</em>&rdquo;) as well (<em>ST</em> 1a
2&aelig; 35,2). In ancient Greek philosophy the most standard term for
inclusive affective pain, &ldquo;<em>lup&#275;</em>&rdquo;, is
associated more with the grief of bereavement than with bodily
pain. (Stoics, accordingly, used a different term when contrasting
bodily pain with pleasant sensory experiences [Long and Sedley 1987,
Vol. 1, p.&nbsp;421; Cooper 1996a/1999, p.&nbsp;245/415; Cooper 1998/1999,
pp.  75, 401n13/454]). They, however, used
&ldquo;<em>h&#275;don&#275;</em>&rdquo; ambiguously to contrast with
both, meaning sometimes affective pleasure but sometimes pleasant sensory
experiences, similarly to uses (2) and (4) distinguished six paragraphs
below. Cicero (2001 translation) notes this and disambiguates when translating into
Latin [<em>de finibus</em> III, 35].) </p>
 

<p>
<strong>The distinction between sensation and affect</strong> was
sometimes obscured in the associationist psychology and dawning
neurology of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
despite a long-term trend toward recognizing the distinctiveness of affect culminating in
Kant&rsquo;s making Feeling a separate faculty alongside Cognition and
Desire (Kant 1790/2000; see the Bibliography note on this). The distinction
between affective feelings and sensations became a special subject of
controversy among introspectionist experimental psychologists of the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Some classified
affective feelings with sensations or even identified them with
specific bodily sensations (Gardiner, Metcalf, and Beebe-Center 1937,
pp.&nbsp;337&ndash;39; Titchener 1924, Lectures II and III; see n.&nbsp;2,
&para;3 below for more). But a distinction between affective distress
and pain sensation is recovered already in Bertrand Russell 1921,
pp.&nbsp;69&ndash;72, following the neurologist Henry Head (cf.&nbsp;Trigg
1970, pp. 2ff.; Aydede 2000). This distinction seems now well
established in science and philosophy, although some resistance from philosophers
remains (e.g., Helm 2002).  The dissociable sensory and affective
components normally associated in bodily pain seem each to have their
own psychological and physiological reality.  For further discussion 
see Aydede 20013, &sect;&sect; 5 and 6.1, which also
links to comprehensive pain bibliographies at its end.  For further discussion of the sensory/affective
distinction, focused more on pleasure, see &sect;1.1, &para;2 and
n.&nbsp;2 below <em>ad loc.</em></p>

<p>

<strong>Contemporary psychologists&rsquo; contrast of positive affect
with negative affect </strong> allows that these may not be
magnitudes that can be added together or represented as in opposite
directions along a single natural dimension. Indeed, David Watson and
his collaborators, prominent contributors to the relevant psychological literature, have throughout argued that they are not. He
believes himself to be indicating two <em>orthogonal</em> (separable
and independent in mathematical analysis) dimensions of affect. (See
Watson 2000, pp.&nbsp;26&ndash;33 and 44&ndash;54, for his reasons and for
references to the psychological literature.) The use of
&ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;negative&rdquo; to partition
affective states is decades older; the idea of such partition is
ancient and so is recognition of its difficulties and
subtleties. Plato argues that many emotions typically involve feelings
of both pleasure and pain (<em>Philebus</em> 47E1&ndash;50C9) and Aristotle
(likewise quoting Homer&rsquo;s Achilles, <em>Iliad</em> xviii:108&ndash;10)
allowed in his early <em> Rhetoric</em> that this is the case at least for anger (because it typically
involves taking pleasure in thoughts of conspicuous revenge, and not
only pain at the thought of an undeserved conspicuous slight,
<em>Rhetoric</em> II, 2:1378a31&ndash;b9) and also that some of what
intuitively count as passions or emotions (<em>path&#275;</em>) need
not involve occurrent pleasure or pain (Cooper 1996a/1999). The basic
distinction between feeling good and feeling bad is, so far, a very
well supported and almost universally recognized one. (The
claim, in a paper written jointly by a senior philosopher and a
social psychology graduate student, that no single distinction in this
area is central to affect, seems uninformed on the relevant harder
science; see the Bibliography note on Solomon and Stone 2002.)
&ldquo;Valence&rdquo; is also used in psychological literature to mark
the same contrast between affective pleasure and affective pain, or
distress. (For further discussion, see n. 29 below.)</p>

<p>

Once pleasure and pain are thought of as independent realities,
neither of which consists in the mere absence of the other, and that, for all we know intuitively, might be based in different biological states or neural systems,
Watson&rsquo;s position should not be that 
surprising&nbsp;&ndash; even to a
hedonist who supposes that only pleasure is intrinsically
good and only pain intrinsically bad. The appearance that
pleasure, or feeling good, must be the contrary of pain, or feeling
bad, and so must <em>pro tanto</em> (i.e., to the extent it is
present) exclude pain, may derive from the <em>semantic</em> polar opposition of
<em>good</em> and <em>bad</em>. But even if this semantic opposition
enters into the analysis of the concepts <em>pleasure</em> and
<em>pain</em>, that would not imply that feeling or experience that is
(or seems) intrinsically good must psychobiologically exclude feeling or experience that
is (or seems) intrinsically bad, any more than it follows merely from
this same semantic opposition that good music and bad cannot
simultaneously fill the same space or affect the same person. Whether
and how a person can have mixed good and bad feelings is an old
empirical question. From Plato&rsquo;s discussion of the pain of hunger&rsquo;s
correlation with pleasure in eating (<em>Gorgias</em> 495D2&ndash;497D7) to
contemporary discussions of temperament and mood, it has been argued
that the correlations between pleasure and suffering do not support
their absolutely or even <em>pro tanto</em> excluding each other, as
someone&rsquo;s sitting and standing or something&rsquo;s speed and slowness
do. The cumulative psychological evidence, both on occurrent feeling
and temperament, that they do not always (even <em>pro tanto</em>)
exclude each other is plausible (Thayer 1989, 1996; Watson 2000).
(But cf. J.A. Russell 1991 and J.A. Russell and Barrett 1999, opponents of
Watson and Thayer on this question.) Differences in brain physiological basis
(see &sect;3 below on pleasure and Rainville 2002 on
negative affect in pain) are relevant but not decisive, since we are dealing with phenomena
&lsquo;re-represented&rsquo; at successive levels of hierarchical brain organization rather than simply localized in one area, as is
sometimes suggested (e.g., Schroeder 2004). And surely information about positive and negative affect are integrated at <em>some</em> level, as overall reports on how one&rsquo;s feeling and everyday trade-offs when choosing between options containing both pleasure and pain clearly show.  
The task of telling whether we really experience a single integrated affective experience utility or only have the ability to report an affect-free representation used in forming a single decision utility will not be an easy one (Berridge and O&rsquo;Doherty, 2014).
(For additional historical
perspective and references on the dimensional structure of affect, see
n.&nbsp;29.)</p>

<p>

<strong>The remainder of this note defends the inclusive usage of
&ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;</strong> and semantically similar terms adopted here <strong>and distinguishes
such uses from others</strong>. This may be unneeded by readers untroubled
by the philosophical literature of 1949&ndash;1973 referenced in this note&rsquo;s
last three paragraphs. <em>Those willing to provisionally accept this
inclusive usage</em> without evidence that it is widespread and grounded in
natural ways of categorizing experience (and thus not to be dismissed
out of hand as a mere philosophers&rsquo; confusion or tendentious
invention) <em>may wish to skip now to this note&rsquo;s last paragraph</em>.</p>

<p>

The inclusive usage seems to mark a natural attractor in human
semantic or conceptual space. Inclusive uses of terms such as
&ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; run through an historically connected discourse
in European languages from ancient Greece to the present, often using
Greek &ldquo;<em>h&#275;don&#275;</em>&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<em>chara</em>&rdquo;, Latin &ldquo;<em>voluptas</em>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<em>laetitia</em>&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;<em>delectatio</em>&rdquo;, and their descendants and
translations in modern languages. Similar uses seem to occur elsewhere, as
sometimes in the Buddhist Sanskrit contrast of
&ldquo;<em>sukha</em>&rdquo; with &ldquo;<em>du&#7717;kha</em>&rdquo;
using prefixes for good and bad congruently with the English contrast
of &ldquo;feeling good&rdquo; with &ldquo;feeling bad&rdquo;. And the
linguist Anna Wierzbicka suggests, on the basis of broader
linguistic evidence, that all languages can express <em>feeling
good</em>, with those lacking a special lexical item using ones
 for <em>good</em> and <em>feeling</em> (which seem everywhere present)
together for this (Wierzbicka 1999, pp.&nbsp;279&ndash;82,
292&ndash;93). Cross-cultural evidence on the categorization of
emotions, summarized in J.A. Russell 1991, also tends to support a
culturally universal category of positive affect. Such inclusive or
generic usage is thus not easily dismissed as a mere philosophers&rsquo;
invention. (To what extent such categorization is a true guide to something deeper in
our nature is the
larger question that is a principal subject of &sect;&sect; 2 and 3
below.) Inclusive uses are not restricted to high theory. Ordinary
speech, song, and lyric poetry use them freely as well.</p>

<p>

Many terms used for (1) inclusive or generic pleasure have
related uses in which they denote (2)
pleasant, or at least typically pleasant, experiences, sometimes
especially sensory experiences or to (3)&nbsp;someone&rsquo;s being placated
or <em>pleased by</em>, or <em>pleased</em> or satisfied <em>with or about</em>, someone
or something. Latin origins in verbs tied to (3) may leave
traces in nonaffective uses of &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; and cognate
terms. (For example, the <em>placita</em> of Roman law, medieval, and modern law
were agreeable only in that they were things <em>agreed to</em> or accepted
by the parties or authorities concerned; they were thus marked as
expressions of decision or consent, rather than of
merriment or of feeling contented. Later and current nonaffective uses of cognates are noted
four paragraphs below.) &ldquo;Pleasure&rdquo; and its cognates
displaced from common speech, in their inclusive usage, older English
words that were becoming tainted by impolite associations; e.g.,
&ldquo;lust&rdquo; (see <em>OED</em>, <em>ad loc.</em>).</p>

<p>

Beyond these uses involving mental states, acts, or processes
involving positive affect, there are related uses in which (4) the
particular or typical occasions, causes, or objects on which instances
of these psychological phenomena depend may be called
&ldquo;pleasures&rdquo; and the like. (On the parallel Greek usage of
&ldquo;<em>h&#275;donai</em>&rdquo;, see Owen 1971&ndash;72, a landmark
paper applying this distinction to the interpretation of Aristotle&rsquo;s
two discussions of pleasure in the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>.
Analogous English usage permits an annoying person, job, fact, or
circumstance to be called &ldquo;a pain&rdquo;.) For discussion of
various uses of &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; and overlapping terms in
English, see Perry 1967, pp.&nbsp;41&ndash;73. For usages in other
languages, see, besides standard dictionaries and lexicons, such as
those listed in the Bibliography, the discussion of various uses of
&ldquo;<em>sukha</em>&rdquo; in Pali Buddhist texts by Buddhaghosa,
1920&ndash;21 translation, I, i, pp.&nbsp;52&ndash;54.</p>

<p>

&ldquo;Physical pleasure&rdquo;, &ldquo;bodily pleasure&rdquo;,
&ldquo;sensory pleasure&rdquo;, and &ldquo;pleasures of
sensation&rdquo; may be used for the sensory part of the range of (2)
or for restrictions of either (1) or (4) to cases involving that.
For many ancient and medieval writers and for their modern followers
such as Descartes and Brentano, such uses involve an implied contrast
with pleasure in or caused by thinking, judging, or willing. (Notes
19&ndash;21 below provide citations.) Differences in higher cognitive
involvement also lie behind joy being often classified as an emotion,
involving more explicit positive evaluation of something (e.g.,
Duncker 1941, pp.&nbsp;401&ndash;2), rather than with pleasure as a mere
feeling. Thomas Aquinas uses the cognate
&ldquo;<em>gaudium</em>&rdquo; for the intellectually-caused species
of pleasure (<em>delectatio</em>): <em>Summa Theologi&aelig;</em> 1a
2&aelig; 31,3, following a distinction transmitted through translation
from the Arabic of ibn Sina (&lsquo;Avicenna&rsquo;), citing his
<em>De Anima</em> IV, 5, 2iva.  (This is the psychological part,
<em>al-Nafs</em>, of <em>Kitab al-Shifa&rsquo;</em>, the chief
philosophical work of this important Islamic physician and philosopher
who lived in Central Asia and Persia, 980&ndash;1037.) Cf. the similar
distinction in Buddhist texts discussed in &sect;&nbsp;3.3,
&para;3. For Hobbes and Locke also joy is pleasure of the mind
(Hobbes, 1651/1994, I,vi,&para;12; Locke, 1700/1979, II,xx,7). And Aquinas
(<em>ST</em> 1a 2&aelig; 35,2 and 36,1) similarly distinguishes
between the genus, inclusive pain (<em>dolor</em>), and its
intellectually caused species, sorrow (<em>tristitia</em>).
Still the tradition, with common sense, regarded pleasure and pain
as single topics.  Thus
Plato and Aristotle, despite their insistence on the
diversity of pleasure and their use of the distinction
between pleasure of the body and of the mind, still treat pleasure as
a single subject and use ordinary terms inclusively when discussing it
(&sect;2.2).</p>

<p>

However, during the vogue of &lsquo;ordinary language
philosophy&rsquo;, between 1949 and 1973, some philosophers writing in
English rejected the inclusive conception of pleasure on the basis of
claims about the disparate usage of relevant expressions in
contemporary English, often emphasizing differences between
&ldquo;enjoying (activities and experiences)&rdquo; and &ldquo;being
pleased&rdquo; (by states of affairs or the like). 
See, for example, Kenny 1963,
p.&nbsp;55; Perry 1967, especially pp.&nbsp;214&ndash;17; and contrast
Gosling 1969 on &ldquo;being pleased&rdquo; with Taylor 1963,
pp.&nbsp;8&ndash;9 on uses of &ldquo;being pleased with ...&rdquo;
signifying dispositional contentment that may obtain absent any
occurrent positive affect, similarly to use (3) of three paragraphs above. (Fred Feldman&rsquo;s account of pleasure as a
pure propositional attitude that need involve no affect may respond in
part to this use; Feldman 2004, discussed in &sect;2.3.2 below.)
William of Ockham, in discussing a similar ambiguity in the Latin cognate
&ldquo;<em>complacens</em>&rdquo; of the everyday Latin shared by medieval European elites with diverse first languages, notes a similar sense in which someone
might be said to be pleased (<em>complacens</em>) without taking
pleasure (<em>delectat</em>, cognate with &ldquo;delight&rdquo;)
(2001, Q. 3, 3b ii, pp.&nbsp;379/411&ndash;12). See three paragraphs above
for the likely origin of these uses, signifying dispositional, attitudinal, or behavioral acquiescence (or perhaps absence of
negative affect), rather than positive affect, toward the content concerned,
in their shared linguistic history. See Goldstein 1985 for
critical discussion of the 1949&ndash;1973 literature and its method, Aydede
2000 for a longer, more general and sympathetic discussion, and Trigg
1970 for its most substantial contribution, of which only Ch. VI
focuses on pleasure (as discussed briefly in n.&nbsp;2, &para;4,
below).</p>

<p>

Whatever the details of such usages may be, a longstanding human
theme and concern should not be dismissed solely on the basis of local
usage&nbsp;&ndash; and still less on the basis of linguistic intuitions
about this produced as needed by philosophers engaged in arguing a
point. Writing from a broader linguistic perspective, Wierzbicka and
Harkins (2001, p.&nbsp;17) have noted modern spoken English&rsquo;s unusual
scarcity of &lsquo;active&rsquo; intransitive verbs for feeling and
emotion and its preference for using &lsquo;passive&rsquo; adjectives
instead for these. In this linguistic climate, &lsquo;enjoying
activities&rsquo; and &lsquo;being pleased by something&rsquo; may seem
to exhaustively divide pleasure&rsquo;s territory and thus to show that some
ulterior activity, content, or object is logically required in every
case (e.g., Perry 1967, pp.&nbsp;214&ndash;17). But as Gosling
observed looking back over this literature, that &ldquo;feel
pleased&rdquo; requires a complement seems nothing deeper than an
English grammatical demand (1969, p. 153), perhaps in this case
connected with the etymology of &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; noted four
paragraphs above. Others had put much weight on such grammatical
matters; for example, Ryle had concluded from &ldquo;enjoy&rdquo; being
a transitive verb, requiring an object, that enjoyment cannot exist on
its own, as a matter of conceptual necessity (1954a, p.&nbsp;61). But
it had not always been so with commonly used English terms occupying
much the same semantic space. Jolly English hosts of centuries past who
bade their guests &lsquo;rejoice, make merry, and be of good
cheer&rsquo; were not, by grammatical necessity, also inviting them to
find suitable objects to do these toward, since there was in each case
an established intransitive use. Neither need the &ldquo;wine that
maketh glad the heart of man&rdquo; (<em>Psalms</em>, 104:15, King
James Version) provide an object or content in so doing, either in
ancient Hebrew, the King&rsquo;s English, or that of psychopharmacology.
These points are worth noting, since while the mid-twentieth-century
philosophical literature is fading from memory, it is still sometimes
assumed that it showed all inclusive usage artificial and
illegitimate, &ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo; a more philosophically
respectable substitute for &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;, or pleasure to
always consist in an &lsquo;attitude&rsquo; like belief and desire,
necessarily taking an intentional or even a propositional object, as a
matter of something deeper than parochial grammatical necessity. (The
question of whether pleasure has intentional structure will come up
again, briefly later in this section and then throughout 
&sect;2.3.)</p>

<p>

Following inclusive usage, &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;,
&ldquo;joy&rdquo;, their cognates, and near synonyms will often be used
freely and almost interchangeably here, guided by idiomatic
usage&nbsp;&ndash; while leaving open how much deeper psychological
unity and diversity such inclusive usage and its narrower cousins
conceal or reveal. We shall in &sect;&sect;3.2 and 3.3 consider
scientific evidence bearing on this substantive question, on which
ordinary language provides only a small part of the total
evidence&nbsp;&ndash; and any single term&rsquo;s or language&rsquo;s use over an
historically short time a very small part indeed.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2" id="note-2">2.</a> Locke 1700/1979, <em>An Essay
concerning Human Understanding</em>, II, xx, 1. Beyond his account there in Chapter XX, 
see his hedonistic views of motivation and practical reasons in II, vii, 2-6 and II, xxi, 39-46.  Hume allows that experiences of pleasure may be &ldquo;very different&rdquo; so long as they
&ldquo;have only such a distant resemblance, as is requisite
[on the empiricist view of the formation of such concepts that he shared with Locke] to make them be express&rsquo;d by the same abstract term&rdquo; (<em>A Treatise of Human Nature</em>
iii, i, 2; cf. Smith 1790/1976, Labukt 2012). Kant like Locke regards pleasure (<em>Lust</em>) as
admitting of no precise intrinsic verbal definition, but offers
indirect causal and functional characterizations (1790/2000, p. 33/Ak.
20:231; see Bibliography note for more on Kant). Locke, in contrast,
often omits pleasure&rsquo;s traditional direct connection with motivation,
but only because he believes that pleasure&rsquo;s equally conceptually
primitive evil twin, &lsquo;uneasiness&rsquo; (i.e., pain, II, xx, 15), plays
the predominant or even sole direct role there, with pleasure
motivating mainly or solely by way of the painfulness of its
represented lack (II, xx, 6; II, xxi, 31&ndash;47, 59, 64), at least in our
needy earthly state (II, xxi, 46).</p> 

<p>
The simple picture of pleasure and further hedonistic views which Locke share had common ancient antecedents with other views Locke and his followers also shared.
Epicurus&rsquo; ancient hedonism, atomism in physics, and empiricism
about knowledge had been revived and Christianized in the Renaissance (see
text translations in Kraye, 1997, Part VI) and then promoted by
Gassendi (1592&ndash;1655), who through his writings and followers in continental Europe influenced Locke. The Epicureans, however,  may not have explicitly distinguished
between sensory states and affective ones, although a similar
distinction may be presupposed on some interpretations of their
fragmentary literary remains (e.g., Cooper 1999a; for more references,
see n.&nbsp;30).</p>

<p>
Locke thus seems not to identify pleasure with
any bodily sensation proper and the same may well be predominantly
true of his tradition, despite broad use of the word 
&lsquo;sensation&rsquo; and frequent
attributions of
&lsquo;the sensation view of pleasure&rsquo; in the 
literature. Some who use such language in rejecting it,
however, intend in doing so to include (and perhaps to
ridicule by this characterization) feeling views such
as Locke&rsquo;s actual view as well and thus to reject the simple picture of pleasure and its
experiential core generally (e.g., Anscombe 1957/1963, p.&nbsp;77,
discussed in &sect;1.2 and accompanying n.&nbsp;5 below).</p>

<p>

Descartes, despite his varying and sometimes misleading use of
terms, seems consistently to distinguish mere pleasant sensation from
the soul&rsquo;s contingent and variable affective reaction to it, even when
he is well translated as calling the former &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; (in
a use close to use 2 of n.&nbsp;1, &para;8) and the latter delight or
joy of the soul. Descartes thus approximates to the point credited to
Ryle in the text, but in a Stoic-influenced psychology and dualist
metaphysics for which sensory, appetitive, and many affective processes
(all on his view involving union of immaterial mind and material body)
present special difficulties. Relevant short passages include:
<em>Treatise on Man</em> (CSM I, p.&nbsp;103; AT XI, p.&nbsp;144).
<em>Discourse on Method</em> (CSM I, p. 141; AT VI, p. 59). Meditation
VI (CSM II, pp.&nbsp;52, 53; AT VII, pp.&nbsp;74, 76). <em>Principles
of Philosophy</em> I, &sect;48 (CSM I, p.&nbsp;209; AT VIII&ndash;I,
p.&nbsp;23) and IV, &sect;&sect;190&ndash;91 (CSM I, pp. 281&ndash;82; AT VIII&ndash;I,
pp.&nbsp;317&ndash;18). Letter to Princess Elisabeth, 6 Oct. 1645 (CSM III,
pp.&nbsp;270&ndash;71; AT IV&ndash;II, pp.&nbsp;309&ndash;12). And, most especially,
<em>Passions of the Soul</em> II, &sect;&sect;91 and 94 (CSM I,
pp.&nbsp;360&ndash;62; AT XI, pp.&nbsp;396&ndash;400) and also II, &sect;137 (CSM,
I, p.&nbsp;376; AT, XI, p.&nbsp;430). Since Descartes (CSM III,
p.&nbsp;271; AT IV, p.&nbsp;312 and <em>Passions</em> II, 94, cited
above), philosophers have been accusing others of confusing tickles and
other sensations proper with pleasure, although it is not easy to find
theorists who explicitly did so, except in the late introspectionist
psychology discussed in the next paragraph. Ordinary language often
uses the same terms on both sides of this divide; see uses (1) and (2)
of n.&nbsp;1, &para;8 above. And philosophers, including Descartes
himself, do, too. (In trying to make Descartes&rsquo; usage, in translation,
more consistent than his French usage, in their passage last cited, CSM
translate <em>&ldquo;plaisir</em>&rdquo; [used 
by him here, unlike in some
other places, to mark the affect side of the divide and explicitly as
interchangeable with &ldquo;<em>joie</em>&rdquo;, joy] as
&ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo;, rather than by the cognate
&ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>

However, in the heyday of the neurology-influenced introspectionist
experimental psychology of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries, when the reduction of affects to sensations proper, with
specific sensory transducers and nerve tracts, seemed a reasonable scientific
project (e.g.,&nbsp;Nichols 1892, pp.&nbsp;404&ndash;5), the empiricist
philosopher and introspectionist psychologist Karl Stumpf actually classified
sensory pleasure with sensations (Chisholm 1987; Titchener 1908,
pp.&nbsp;82&ndash;121, provides lengthy quotations, discussion, and
criticism), Bourdon identified &lsquo;sensations of pleasure&rsquo;
(supposedly analogous to sensations of pain) with unlocalized faint
tickling supposedly involving special tickle receptors in the skin (Titchener 1908,
pp.&nbsp;81&ndash;82; Bourdon 1893), and, finally, the early twentieth
century introspectionist psychologist Nafe identified pleasure wholly
with bodily sensations of specific kinds (Beebe-Center 1951,
p.&nbsp;257; Gardiner, Metcalf and Beebe-Center, 1937, p.&nbsp;339;
Beebe-Center 1932, pp.&nbsp;74&ndash;5, 347&ndash;9 and more generally for
discussion of the relevant literature of late introspectionist
psychology, pp.&nbsp;67&ndash;89). 
Controversies over such results, using trained introspectors as subjects, and often
not reproducible by other introspectionist laboratories with their own trained subjects, helped lead to introspectionist
psychology&rsquo;s demise. 
However, bright, light, or warm feelings in the
chest, apparently similar to those reported by Nafe, have been reported 
recently by social psychologists interviewing subjects
said to be experiencing a positive affect of moral elevation (Haidt
2003, p. 864). These are presumably autonomic symptoms, like the
sinking feelings in the gut that may accompany distress. But those
suffering autonomic failure experience affect despite this loss
(although without the amplification somatic feedback may bring), thus
refuting purely autonomic theories of affect. Ryle&rsquo;s (or Descartes&rsquo;,
preceding paragraph) point in the text, so far, seems correct: any
sensation proper may be enjoyed or not, and might even become an annoying
nuisance during an otherwise enjoyable experience, and is thereby shown 
not to be pleasure.
Such sensations may be &lsquo;sensations (symptomatic) of
pleasure&rsquo; on a par with feelings (symptomatic) of indigestion.
But just as those feelings are not one&rsquo;s indigestion, these sensations
are not the pleasure itself. While this seems right at least to a
first approximation, an appreciation of how science
may change our psychological categories bars our sharing Ryle&rsquo;s
complete confidence in intuitions based in them. A.D. (Bud) Craig (2002, 2009, 2015) provides new evidence
for the distinctiveness of interoceptive bodily feeling from other sensation and 
connecting it, by way of its re-representation, with affect, in ways that that might be
used to make a case against a sharp sensory/affective distinction while maintaining
a distinction between affectively toned and affectively neutral bodily sensations
instead.
However, his claims for the necessity of anterior insular cortical activity for positive affective experience are not generally accepted and may involve denying this to young children and animals; a role rather in its cognitive integration and control seems more likely.</p>

<p>

Affective pleasure or pain may, thus or otherwise, in whole or part, be regarded as
<em>representing</em> bodily states, by virtue of responding to the
fulfillment of needs or to good bodily conditions, as such, if only in
an austere functional and information-processing sense (not
involving such information being accessible by a subject as such), as
warranted by studies of the relevant physiological systems, their
connections, and likely functions. Hypotheses of Plato (&sect;2.2.1)
and Descartes (see, additionally and especially <em>Passions of the
Soul</em>, II,&nbsp;93 &amp; 95 (CSM pp.&nbsp;361 &amp; 362; AT
pp.&nbsp;398 &amp; 400) may be thus understood. This would also be a
minimalist way of understanding the recent suggestions of Antonio
Damasio (1994, chs. 8 &amp; 9; 1999 <em>passim</em>; 2003,
pp.&nbsp;85&ndash;90, 105&ndash;8, 111&ndash;12, 137&ndash;38; Adolphs and Damasio 2001,
pp. 28&ndash;30; cf. Craig 2002, 2009, 2015), on which the relevant information-bearing affective states
may be unlike the states we standardly count as bodily sensations in
that their bodily informational content is typically beyond the
ability of human subjects to report. Even on this minimalist reading,
however, Damasio such interpretations of affective neuroscience remain of
interest for intentional accounts of pleasure (&sect;2.3 below) and
representational theories of mind (e.g., Tye 1995,
pp.&nbsp;128&ndash;30). The areas important in affect do not include the
primary somatosensory cortex. Still, their being able to produce
chills and shivers &lsquo;of pleasure&rsquo; (Damasio 2003, pp.&nbsp;102&ndash;3) gives
one pause.  However, if these are, as it seems, somatic symptoms that
may be either liked or disliked, Ryle&rsquo;s point and our distinction
between sensation proper and affect would still apply. (See Trigg
1970, Ch. VI, pp.&nbsp;102&ndash;24 for a clear statement of the case for
there not being sensations of pleasure on a par with sensations of
pain; also Aydede 2000.) It is, however, possible that the distinction
between sensation proper and affect, defended so far above, is like
much else in the brain (including cognitive processing) a matter of
degree. Feelings of hot and cold, as Craig (2002) points out,
seem to have especially close connections both with affect and with
homeostatic need or drive states. And feelings of nausea seem
especially hard to like, however <em>generally</em> persuasive Ryle&rsquo;s
claim may be. Distinguishing cold cognitive representation, affect, and
motivation may even so be possible, if not always by distinguishing 
between psychobiological occurrences, then between their naturally 
specifiable properties or relations.  This tripartite distinction
has not yet been shown to be founded <em>only</em> in our 
cognition, in our natural/intuitive theory of mind.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-3" id="note-3">3.</a>
Late nineteenth and early twentieth century introspectionist
psychology had aimed to discover the supposed basic introspectible
elements of conscious experience and validate them using reports of
specially trained subjects. But such reports had proved too plastic
and easily biased by different laboratories&rsquo; training to settle
contested questions, such as whether pleasure and pain are specific
sensations, elements of mind of a kind distinct from sensations, or
&lsquo;hedonic tones&rsquo; incapable of independent existence but qualifying
other introspected elements of mind (Beebe-Center 1932; Alston 1967,
pp. 333&ndash;34).  From a contemporary scientific point view, while the
sensation/affect distinction seems plausible, questions about which
experiential features are mental atoms and which their essential and
which their accidental properties seem idle relicts of psychology&rsquo;s
High Introspectionist past.  Features seem typically to arise
separately, preconsciously, and locally and then sometimes to be bound
in more global integrative processing, rather than there being
experiential substantial particulars in which their ontologically
dependent features inhere.  (For a psychologist
applying this threefold Aristotelian distinction between substances,
essential properties, see Duncker, 1941, 399&ndash;400
and note the tension with what he actually introspects on p. 404. For
a philosopher&rsquo; claim that it is logically necessary that pleasure inhere in some experience with nonhedonic qualities, see Broad, 1930, 235 and
228ff. more generally.)
</p>

<p>

In time the project of distinguishing invariant kinds of basic element given as such in conscious experience was rejected as untrue to the contextual plasticity shown by experiential reports. Not long afterward introspection as a formal method of academic psychological inquiry was abandoned, too. Having rejected the claim of introspection to be the one true method for experimental psychology, and lacking the methodological pluralism by which we now seek a consilience of evidence converging from a wide variety of methods and sources (e.g., from brain imaging, computational modeling, and self-report), psychology and related areas of economics and philosophy took a sharp behaviorist turn. 
</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4" id="note-4">4.</a> Ryle: 1949, Ch.  IV,
esp. pp.&nbsp;107&ndash;10, principally followed in the text; cf. 1954a, especially
pp.&nbsp;58&ndash;61 and 1954b, especially pp.&nbsp;136&ndash;38. The view
accorded qualified praise in his 1954a, p. 60, &para;1 may be
Aristotle&rsquo;s.  Further discussion is provided in the Bibliography notes
to these. A possible explanation for the difficulty of introspecting
pleasure, which had earlier led to the rejection of experiential views
of pleasure in psychology which lies behind the views of Ryle and his
followers, is offered in &sect;1.3, last two paragraphs.</p>

<p>

The view that pleasure is not a conscious experience had become fairly
standard in psychology classrooms and literature during the
increasingly behaviorist 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, in the
wake of the collapse of the introspectionist project described at the end of
&sect;1.1 above. The prevalent methodology emphasized
that the concepts of psychology, as of other sciences, are
constructed, rather than given in experience. See Beebe-Center 1951,
pp. 255&ndash;59 and 295&ndash;96, which parades these views as proud achievements
of the past decades, with quotations and references. That subjective
experience might even so contribute something to this construction and
be part of a psychological concept&rsquo;s reference seems not to have been
considered.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5" id="note-5">5.</a> G.E.M. Anscombe,
<em>Intention</em>, 1963/1957, pp. 77&ndash;78. A shorter version appears in
the seventh paragraph of her widely reprinted &ldquo;Modern Moral
Philosophy&rdquo;, 1981b/1958, which appears in her 1981a, Vol. 3, at
p.&nbsp;27. (Her moral animus against utilitarianism and its
relation to her dismissive treatment of pleasure are there explicit.) Others
of the same era also put much emphasis on the concept&rsquo;s ordinary
language explanatory role, sometimes to the point of seeming to reduce
the term&rsquo;s meaning to its conversation-stopping force, as when the
answer, &ldquo;For pleasure,&rdquo; blocks the further question,
&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; E.g., Nowell-Smith 1954, pp.&nbsp;111&ndash;115
127&ndash;32.  (Contrast Moran 2004, discussed toward this section&rsquo;s end,
who takes the same answer to commit one to being able to specify, on
demand, exactly what one finds pleasant and how.)  Cf.&nbsp;Kenny,
1963, pp.&nbsp;34&ndash;45, where the point is made but its overemphasis
criticized (at pp.&nbsp;140&ndash;41), as also in Gosling (1969).  The
observation that we never ask for a further motive beyond enjoyment
is credited by Aristotle to an argument of Eudoxus. 
(<em>NE</em> X,1:1172b20&ndash;23).</p>

<p>

Anscombe explicitly draws on Wittgenstein&rsquo;s views of mind, drawing a
parallel between Wittgenstein&rsquo;s rejection of an experience picture
of meaning in his <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> and her own rejection of
the simple picture of pleasure. For a taste of
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s own much more tentative and less dismissive late work on affect, see his
<em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, &sect;244 and p.&nbsp;189 and,
from his notebooks, <em>Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology</em>,
Vol. 1, ed. G.E.M. Anscombe and G.H. von Wright (Oxford: Blackwell,
1980) &sect;&sect;449&ndash;453, 807 and 896.</p>

<p>

Anscombe&rsquo;s strongly but sparsely stated dismissal of hedonism and of
pleasure was influentially accepted by John Rawls, <em>A Theory of
Justice</em>, 2nd ed., 1999 [passage unchanged from 1st ed., 1971]),
pp. 489&ndash;90, n. 28 [1st ed., p. 559, n.&nbsp;27]). Rawls&rsquo; main argument in
this section (&sect;84.&nbsp;Hedonism as a Method of Choice), for the
conclusion that hedonistic utilitarianism provides no general decision
procedure for ethics that removes the need for deliberative judgment,
does not depend on Wittgenstein&rsquo;s views, but as Rawls notes may be
supported on premises seemingly granted by the hedonistic utilitarian
Henry Sidgwick (1907) just as well. The upshot of Rawls&rsquo; discussion is
that granting that pleasure is no introspectible homogeneous
magnitude, as Sidgwick does, removes what Sidgwick elsewhere regards
as hedonistic utilitarianism&rsquo;s decisive advantage over pluralistic
moral common sense&nbsp;&ndash; its specifying a single end
(maximizing total pleasure) that, in principle, determines what ought
or may be done in each case, epistemic difficulties aside. (Cf. III,
xi with III, xiv of Sidgwick 1907.)</p>

<p>

Sidgwick, having failed to find any special introspectible quality
distinguishing his experiences of pleasure (1907, pp.&nbsp;127&ndash;31),
characterized pleasure as &ldquo;Desirable Consciousness or Feeling of
whatever kind&rdquo; (p.&nbsp;402). His hedonistic methods come down
to judging comparative desirability, guided by affective memory. This 
seemed to Rawls not to track an independent truth about value but rather to
deliberatively construct one. That was not Sidgwick&rsquo;s intention. &ldquo;[E]thical
Hedonism has chiefly a negative significance; for the statement that
&lsquo;Pleasure is the Ultimate Good&rsquo; will only mean that
nothing is ultmately desirable except desirable feeling, apprehended
as desirable by the sentient individual at the time of feeling
it&rdquo; (1907, p.&nbsp;129). Sidgwick thus intended momentary cognitive perspectives on desirability
to constrain the correctness of judgments of value made at remote
times. Hence he took the risks of error in comparisons of pleasure
experienced at different times seriously (1907, II, iii), as he could
not have done had his method given deliberation a more autonomous
good-constitutive role, as Rawls came to do. What are aggregated are
not quantities of a homogeneous felt quality (which Sidgwick doubts)
but experiences&rsquo; momentarily apprehended degrees of
desirability. Deliberation is limited to the role of a hypothetical
transtemporal (and &lsquo;transworld&rsquo;, across possible
situations) ideal observer-and-desirer, choosing so as to maximize the
aggregate of desirabiliity, known from momentary experiential perspectives
(from which hedonic experience is, presumably, thought of as
inseparable) and then imperfectly represented in actual, non-ideal memory. Sidgwick 1907, I, ix, 3, pp.&nbsp;109&ndash;13 and
pp.&nbsp;127&ndash;31, on which see Christiano 1992 and the further discussion in n. 18 below.</p>

<p>

The eminent psychologist Daniel Kahneman in the 1990s was similarly realist
about magnitudes of momentary pleasure and had a similar project of
establishing &lsquo;objective utility&rsquo; on the basis of momentary
hedonic experience. But he moved the definition of pleasure
(&ldquo;instant utility&rdquo;) in a motivational direction, much as had Victorians criticized by Sidgwick
(Kahneman 1999, p.&nbsp;4; Sidgwick 1907, pp.&nbsp; 125ff.), without the subtlety of Sidgwick&rsquo;s final
normatively constrained position, which is also ignored or by many philosophical interpreters. (See, however the good treatment in Schneewind 1977, 316 ff.)   Kahneman
advanced his project by experimentally demonstrating errors in hedonic
memories, using third person observations and self-reports at the time
to test these. He also attempted to explain such errors systematically
(Kahneman, Wakker and Sarin 1997; Kahneman 1999, 2000; Kahneman and Tversky 2000).</p>

<p>

Supplementing memory by more objective methods may thus increase our
confidence that there is a real difference between determinate
intrinsic features of momentary experience and the reflective and
comparative hedonic judgment and deliberation that discover and use
evidence about these. Observing facial expression, posture, and
behavior provide some objective evidence and connections with
neuroscience and behavioral science may provide more&nbsp;&ndash;
without abandoning the epistemic primacy of the judgment of the
experiencer at the time of experiencing on which Sidgwick
insists. (See, generally, his <em>Methods</em> 1907, I , iv, 4; II,
ii, iii and vi, which last is most relevant for deciding how Sidgwick
would regard this response to Rawls.)  NeoSidgwickian responses to
Rawls also might use hedonic deliberation and even introspective
access to pleasure only to help fix the reference of
&ldquo;pleasure&rdquo;&nbsp;&ndash; rather than as definitive about its
presence, magnitude, or nature. Such approaches would fit well with
allowing pleasure without awareness, as in n.&nbsp;27 and the
accompanying text at the end of &sect;2.3.4.</p>



<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6" id="note-6">6.</a> Helm 1994, 2001a, 2001b,
2002. Helm&rsquo;s larger view may have relativist consequences (Hursthouse
2002) that Anscombe would reject. And John McDowell, not Anscombe,
seems to have been the formative influence on his work.  Helm&rsquo;s views
seem more at home as an account of the more cognitively implicated and
culturally embedded human emotions, which presumably suggested the
view. Anscombe, moreover, wished to distinguish concept-involving
emotions from pleasure (but perhaps only from pleasure not caused by
thought, if her views were here, as in some other matters, close to
those of Kenny [1963, p.&nbsp;55] and Aquinas [<em>ST</em> 1a 2&aelig;
31, 3]). With Helm, all emotion counts as pleasure or pain (as in large
part, but not in all cases, for Aristotle; see Cooper 1996a/1999) and
is treated similarly. </p>
 

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-7" id="note-7">7.</a>
In taking such a view, rather than a global, externalist functionalist view 
(e.g., David Armstrong 1968 and Hilary Putnam in
papers of the same period, reprinted in Putnam 1975, especially
chs. 18 and 21)
we might follow Aristotle better than Anscombe or they succeeded in doing, following the interpretation of Jessica Moss, whose 2012 integrates her scholarly articles on Aristotle of the preceding years.
On her reading,
Aristotle was as thoroughly empiricist in his moral epistemology as in his account of the emergence of higher cognition from sense perception, and the process begins in the nonconceptual appearance of their own good through pleasure which all animals have.
Aristotle, however, was a teleologist as well as an empiricist, and this may make the induction to a conceptual representation of own good and good from nonconceptual pleasure less problematic than on a less teleological contemporary view. See, however, Elijah Millgram&rsquo;s 1997.

Textual Note: The complete poem, a very famous one, is available in
many editions and anthologies. I follow a version widely printed at
least from the nineteenth century until the late twentieth. Recent
editions may diverge, notably in omitting
&ldquo;<em>lachen</em>&rdquo; in line 22 (but not in line 29), which,
however, has some manuscript support.</p>

<p>

Historical Note: The &lsquo;letters from Rome&rsquo; concern the Papal
excommunication of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II Hohenstaufen in
1227. The cause was his delay in joining the Sixth
Crusade&nbsp;&ndash; in which he in time negotiated the peaceful
transfer of most of Jerusalem with its Christian shrines to Western
Christian rule, while Muslim rule continued over the Sanctuary
precinct with al-Aqsa Mosque. This brought peace for a time, despite
protests from religious authorities on both sides.</p>

pleasure, perhaps through spreading activation in the left

p. 211. Darwin&rsquo;s evolutionary account of emotional expression as in
large part &ldquo;innate and instinctive&rdquo; (p. 22) is in this
edition brought up to date by Paul Ekman, a major contributor to its
scientific revival, with references to recent scientific literature
and commentary informed by this throughout and especially in his
Afterword.  The literature to that date, and also Ekman until then,
had mainly supported a single positive basic affect but several
negative ones, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust.  That near-consensus is
now vanished: see Izard 1991, especially Chapter 4, for a division
with two basic positive emotions, joy and interest, following Tomkins
1962; neuroscience that may underly such a distinction is discussed in
&sect;3.3 below.  For conjectures and evidence that there may be more
than two basic positive affects than these see Panksepp 1998, 2000a, 2014 and Panksepp and Biven 2012;
Fredrickson 1998; Ekman 1999a, p.&nbsp;55; Haidt 2003; 
Hejmadi, Davidson, and Rozin 2000; Prinz 2004,
pp.&nbsp;155&ndash;56; Tracy and Robins 2004; Campos and Keltner 2014. Still any distinctions
between positive affects do not seem as strongly marked as those
between plausibly discrete negative emotions such as sadness, anger,
fear, and disgust. While cross-culturally validating short lists of
discrete basic emotions by translating subjects&rsquo; identifications of
emotions from photographs in their own emotion terms into English, as
practiced by Ekman and others in his tradition, has been
methodologically criticized (see Ekman 1999b for some summary accounts
with his replies), such criticism even if correct would not invalidate
the category of positive affect, which is strongly supported
crossculturally and uncontroversial, even if there is differentiation
within it and uncertainty about how deep in the neural and experiential constitutions of pleasure and pain it goes. See Wierzbicka 1999 (pp.&nbsp;279&ndash;82, 292&ndash;3, 305&ndash;7) and
Harkins and Wierzbicka 2001 for a taste of some of the relevant
ethnographic and linguistic literature, which is but a very small part
of the relevant evidence. (The precise nature of the distinction
between positive and negative affect is not yet resolved; see
n.&nbsp;1, &para;&para;4 and 5 above and n.&nbsp;29 below.)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11" id="note-11">11.</a> For an entry to the
relevant scientific literature, see Preston and de Waal 2002.  Some
research reviewed there suggests that perception or representation of
emotion in others requires evoking the affect, to some degree, in
oneself, because of overlap among the responsible neural systems.
Emotional contagion, as when an infant is distressed by another&rsquo;s
distress, without fully distinguishing self from other, may, with the
addition of cognitive resources for making this distinction, result in
the development of empathy. And so it may be with
the acquisition of a concept of pleasure applicable both to others
and to oneself as one among others. Studies of autism, in which
deficiencies in labeling one&rsquo;s own emotions seem connected with
problems in precise attributions to others, may support such a view.

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12" id="note-12">12.</a> &ldquo;[W]e cannot be
occupied objectively and subjectively at the same instant ....&rdquo;
(Bain, 1876, pp.&nbsp;437&ndash;8). Cf. J.S. Mill&rsquo;s report of William
Hamilton&rsquo;s view that sensory knowledge and sensory pleasure are
inversely proportional (1872/1879, p. 435). Similar thinking seems to
go back at least to the mid-eighteenth century work of Johan Georg
Sulzer (Gardiner, Metcalf, and Beebe-Center 1937, p.&nbsp;260).  While
the efficacy of distraction in relieving suffering may be no news,
still it is good to see it neuroscientifically confirmed (Drevets and
Raichle 1998).  That a similar effect holds for positive affect (which
facilitates some cognitive tasks in the longer term; Fredrickson 1998,
Isen 2002, Bartolic <em>et al.</em> 2001) has not been so clear. 
Research on rthe brain&rsquo;s default networks may make it so and seems of great
theoretical importance besides (Gusnard <em>et al.</em> 2001, Fox
<em>et al.</em> 2005). It may also explain the seeming paradox that
focusing one&rsquo;s attention on one&rsquo;s pain, like distraction from it, may
lessen affective suffering. But this is relatively new and developing science, and 
its interpretation, here and in the main text, should be
flagged as tentative and its applicability as uncertain.</p>

Riel 1999 and 2000 have very useful accounts of Plato&rsquo;s view and the
relation of Aristotle&rsquo;s to it that I have in part followed here.  The
affective neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp, in the first textbook on that
subject, makes a proposal similar to Plato&rsquo;s and discusses relevant
science (1998, pp.&nbsp;181&ndash;86).</p>

<p>

Plato may be interpreted as taking all pleasure to be intentional
(&sect;2.3), but perhaps only because it quasi-perceptually
represents psychobiological restorations in a way partly analogous to that in
which sense perception
generally is about what it presents.  Daniel Russell (2004), in
interpreting Plato, goes further, by applying a distinction explicit
in the later ancient and medieval tradition, and again nowadays (see
n.&nbsp;22, below), between pleasure as a feeling (or
&lsquo;sensation&rsquo;) and pleasure as an emotional attitude, which
is for Russell always directed toward something being the case
(D. Russell, 2004, p.&nbsp;4), as in the account discussed in
&sect;2.3.2 below.  But Plato may have regarded these as belonging to
the same affective natural continuum, perhaps always intentional
(whether about things, features of perceptual experience, or states of
affairs), but not regimented by construal as uniformly directed even 
toward propositions even for the more intellectual range of cases
 (which may lead to problems, as we shall see in
&sect;2.3.2).  (All intentional accounts of pleasure, however, must
omit any moods they construe as contentless [as many seem to be], making
pleasure always a response to something it represents, rather than more inclusively [n. 1 above]).  For Russell, as for Helm and Moran
(&sect;1.2), (emotional) pleasure is holistically value- and
concern-laden.  This seems to be no part of Plato&rsquo;s <em>general</em>
account of pleasure (and it seems to be a single and general, rather than a 
&lsquo;disjunctive&rsquo;,
account that he offers).  Even the &lsquo;pure
pleasure&rsquo; allowed into the good life in the <em>Philebus</em>
(51B&ndash;52B, 63E) includes pleasure in simple sights, sounds,
and smells, which infants and animals free of virtue- and
evaluative-thought-involving projects share. (The distinction
between pure and impure pleasure thus cuts across any
bodily-or-sensory pleasure versus intellectual-or-emotional pleasure
divide.)  With these tentative caveats, Russell&rsquo;s book is an
excellent place to look for further citations and creative
interpretation of Plato&rsquo;s many treatments of pleasure, of varying
date, with an eye to their connections with his moral views and to
developments in later Platonist thought, beyond the summary account of
a supposed single mature Platonic view offered here.  Long discussions of 
Plato&rsquo;s writings on pleasure, in the context of the history
of ancient Greek thought on the subject, may be found in Gosling and Taylor 1982 and Wolfsdorf 2013, which latter also seeks to interpret and criticize ancient views
by comparison with contemporary philosophical literature, on which his views often differ from those expressed here.</p>

Recent Philosophy: Ryle, 1949, 1954a, 1954b; his view is that pleasure
is not an episode but, at least in the cases of enjoyment he
emphasizes, a kind of dispositional interest or attention in one&rsquo;s
activities or experiences. For more, see n.&nbsp;4 with its

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16" id="note-16">16.</a> Csikszentmihalyi,
however, unlike Aristotle, distinguishes enjoyment (his subject,
supposedly experienced in &lsquo;flow&rsquo;) from pleasure, which he
regards as a passive state often connected with Platonic restorations
(1990, pp.&nbsp;45&ndash;48). Flow experiences are ones in which one loses
one&rsquo;s sense of self, engaged in one&rsquo;s use of skills that are
proportionate to the challenges they meet, which absorb one&rsquo;s full
concentration and reward it with immediate feedback (1996, pp.&nbsp;111&ndash;13, lists nine comditions), Csikszentmihalyi, in his wise books, seems to
overplay his hand, by connecting flow to both enjoyment and to the
perfecting of skills (e.g., 1990, p. 65), whereas exercising already
perfected skills seems often more enjoyable than perfecting them,
which may be hard work&nbsp;&ndash; and also by suggesting at times
that achievement in the presence of concentration is better correlated
with positive affect or a species of it (enjoyment of activities) than
it is, although he at times acknowledges that quite simple and
unskilled activities may give moments of flow, too. In his 1997 he
acknowledges that self-ratings of happiness are higher for eating and
socializing than for activities he more approves of (USA ed.,
pp. 36&ndash;37 [UK ed., pp. 34&ndash;35]; see also pp. 101 [98] and 117&ndash;122
[115&ndash;119]). Csikszentmihalyi says that the self-report method, on
which his research program has been based, is unsatisfactory; but that
is the evidence he has, and it seems to indicate that flow correlates
with self-reports of concentration best, with those of enjoyment
fairly well, but with self-ratings of happiness not that well at
all. (However, since the exercise and development of skills he
recommends often brings deferred benefits, including ones for affect,
his advice may still often be good from a long-term hedonic point of
view, even when the required training and practice are not enjoyable
at the time.)  The distinction between flow and happiness may relate
to that between dopaminergic engagement and opioid bliss discussed in
&sect;3.3 below.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17" id="note-17">17.</a> For the criticism of
Aristotle: Mill 1872/1979, pp. 430&ndash;36 . I have in the text supplied
much of the explanation of Aristotle&rsquo;s views and of the force and
historical context of Mill&rsquo;s criticism, which in the original is
directed largely at quotations from his book&rsquo;s target, William
Hamilton, whom Mill took to represent Aristotle&rsquo;s view of pleasure.
(Hamilton&rsquo;s philosophical reputation did not long survive Mill&rsquo;s
criticisms, with the delayed result that this major philosophical work
of Mill&rsquo;s has followed its target into obscurity.) A very similar
counterexample about a smell is given by Anthony Kenny, followed by an
Aristotelian response (1963, pp.&nbsp;146&ndash;50).</p>

<p>

For similar objections to the effect that excellence of music and of
the listener&rsquo;s auditory and musical capacity are neither necessary nor
sufficient for the pleasure of listening to music, see Brentano
1921/1969, 26a, p. 156 and 1929/1981, I,iii,5/p. 14 (not even with
attention added) and van Riel 1999 and 2000a. The case of listening to
music, while mentioned by Aristotle, seems to be an especially
difficult one for his theory and to be well suited to making Mill&rsquo;s
point. Musical and auditory excellence in a listener combined with
excellence of work and performance need not yield great pleasure, for
all the excellence of the faculties and objects concerned, unless
these are defined in terms of affective expressiveness <em>and</em>
its successful communication. See Madell 2002 for a different account
of pleasure in listening to music and a general account of pleasure discussed
critically in &sect;3.1, &para;3, below. To turn to the different case
of pleasure in musical performance, orchestra members are often bored
during well-practiced and technically near-flawless performances of
familiar works. (As van Riel points out in another context,
Aristotle&rsquo;s attempts to address loss of pleasure with repetition and
practice [<em>NE</em> X,4:1175a3&ndash;10] are unconvincing.) Audiences
similarly find such performances less pleasant than those the
conductor has managed to vary and thus make new and appealing to the
performers. (I draw here on a presentation by Ellen Langer of her
empirical research.)</p>

<p>

For the normative agreement with Aristotle: Mill 1871, Ch. 2,
&para;&para;5ff. The evaluative argument aims to prove only the higher
&lsquo;quality&rsquo; (by which Mill means excellence in rank and
choiceworthiness of the &lsquo;higher pleasures&rsquo;; see the
<em>OED, ad loc.</em> quality, 8), rather than, as in Plato and
Aristotle, also their greater pleasantness&nbsp;&ndash; but on the
same ground of the authoritative choice of intellectuals who are
supposedly uniquely qualified to judge by virtue of their past
acquaintance with experiences of both kinds. Systematic errors in
affective memory (Kahneman 1999 and 2000), however, would provide
grounds for skepticism about the adequacy of any actual hedonic memory
representations relied on in such judging, even if the
intellectuals&rsquo; impartiality and freedom from self-deception
is granted. While Mill also believes pleasure is experientially
heterogeneous, he marks that as a separate point. It is, however, likely that both he and Aristotle (whom in these respects Mill seems to follow)
believed all pleasure to be nevertheless experientially
similar, despite differences both experientially and in value.
Neither seems to doubt that there are typically differences in quantity of pleasure that
are not just differences in choiceworthiness, despite epistemic dependence on how
they strike experiencers (even if for Aristotle these experiential
differences in degree of pleasure track with differences in the degree to which something <em>appears</em> good [cf. Moss 2012]).
Their positions are thus different from Rawls&rsquo; discussed
in n.&nbsp;5.</p>

3, pp. 109&ndash;13 and pp. 127&ndash;31, on which see Christiano 1992. For more
on Sidgwick&rsquo;s view,
see n. 5 above. Broad, 1930, pp.&nbsp;237&ndash;38. Derek Parfit apparently
adopts the view that Broad only suggests: pleasure is experience
wanted or liked at the time (1984, p.&nbsp;493). Cf. Edwards 1979,
pp.&nbsp;73&ndash;74 and Warner 1987, p.&nbsp;129.
Sidgwick is better read along the lines of  Moss&rsquo;s reading, discussed in n. 7 above, of Aristotle, Sidgwick&rsquo;s model in writing his <em>Methods</em> (1907, xix&ndash;xx).  
Sidgwick is explicit that this apprehension as desirable is cognitive (1907, 129)
and seems to see it as limited to 
&ldquo;intelligent beings&rdquo; as pleasure
is not (127).
It is therefore highly misleading to characterize Sidgwick as proposing that pleasant experiences are unified only as the objects of an attitude, 
where this suggests a conatively relational (if not voluntarist) constitution of 
pleasure as such, where Sidgwick clearly intends, rather, contingent cognitive recognition
(or at least judgment, 319) of its goodness to be the concept&rsquo;s, but not the  phenomenon&rsquo;s, foundation. 
Pleasure on his view is feeling that does (or would, were there cognitive capacity) present in its moment as good and desirable. In contemporary language, this seems more to fix the term&rsquo;s referent than to offer a theory of 
pleasure&rsquo;s nature.  But this is all that,
for his purpose of characterizing his hedonistic 
&ldquo;methods of ethics&rdquo;, was required.

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20" id="note-20">20.</a>
The deep background includes the Christian Bible&rsquo;s &ldquo;God is love&rdquo;
(<em>ag&aacute;p&#275;</em>, translating Hebrew <em>ahabha</em>; Latin
<em>Vulgate caritas</em>), at <em>1 John</em> 4:16 (cf. <em>John</em>
13:34 and 15:9&ndash;12) in its context, 4:7&ndash;21, of expansive interpretation
of the Hebrew Bible&rsquo;s commandments of love, <em>Leviticus</em> 19:18
and <em>Deuteronomy</em> 6:5, emphasized at <em>Matthew</em> 22:36&ndash;40,
<em>Mark</em> 12:28&ndash;31 and <em>Luke</em> 10:25&ndash;28. Early Christians
might thus view their mutual love as participating in God&rsquo;s. Augustine
interpreted the first text as literally identifying love with the Holy
Spirit, the third person of the Christian Trinity (<em>De
Trinitate</em>, VI, 5). The Augustinian tradition of thinking
of pleasure as willing (X, 10 &amp; 11) and of all willing as love lies behind later
Christian philosophical accounts of pleasure, such as Ockham&rsquo;s and
Brentano&rsquo;s, discussed in &sect;2.3.1 below.</p>
  

<p>
William of Ockham 2001
(c. 1317&ndash;26), especially pp. 384&ndash;86 (420&ndash;22) and Question&nbsp;3,
pp.&nbsp;373&ndash;90 (403&ndash;28), generally; McGrade 1981, 1987.  This last
provides a very useful brief account also of some other fourteenth
century views, with further references. Those referred to unnamed in
the text are, first, Walter Chatton and Adam Wodeham, and then Robert
Holkot (spelled Holcot occasionally, as in the <em>Routledge
Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> entry), on all of whom I rely wholly
on McGrade 1987, especially pp.&nbsp;77&ndash;78. I owe thanks to Professor
McGrade also for much generous early help in revising this note and
the accompanying text; he is innocent, however, of the final result.
Knuuttila observes that Ockham largely follows John Duns Scotus (2004,
pp.&nbsp;268&ndash;73; for Scotus&rsquo;s examples used similarly to distinguish
pleasure from the loving on which it depends as a quality, see
pp.&nbsp;270&ndash;71).  However, for two differences between Scotus and
Ockham, see Hirvonen 2004, pp.&nbsp;127 and 149; Ch.&nbsp;4,
pp.&nbsp;107&ndash;70 is relevant more generally.

</p>

<p>

The picture of affective states as involving assent of the rational
mind to presentation of something as good or bad goes back to the
Stoics (see n.&nbsp;30 for references). Ockham has a more complicated
picture. Following Augustine, the will&rsquo;s acceptance or rejection may
go against the evaluative judgment of the intellect. And like Scotus,
he makes pleasure a natural but not an exceptionless result of loving
acceptance, it seems for a combination of empirical, theological, and
Aristotelian reasons. (Pain, or distress, may block pleasure in an
act.  Appropriating Aristotle, pleasure
is not an act but can be blocked by the act on which it
depends being impeded, and pain blocks pleasure in this
way.  And this allows that the devil in his painful damnation gets no pleasure
from lovingly accepting any fulfillment of his desire, consistently with the
theological tradition.)</p>

<p>

Western medieval discussions often take off from passages in
Augustine where &ldquo;<em>fruitio</em>&rdquo; is defined as clinging
to something with love for its own sake (<em>De Doctrina
Christiana</em> [On Christian Instruction/Doctrine], I,4) and
discussed further as the attitude we should have only toward God,
<em>De Trinitate X</em>, 10; cf. Thomas Aquinas, <em>Summa
Theologi&aelig;</em> 1a 2&aelig; 11. Augustine defines pleasure as
assent toward what we will when cherishing/enjoying/possessing
(&ldquo;<em>fruendo</em>&rdquo;) it (<em>City of God</em> XIV, 6).
Ockham&rsquo;s and others&rsquo; views seem to have emerged in theological debate
centrally concerned with loving acceptance (appropriately, only of
God) as the supremely ultimate object of one&rsquo;s love
(&ldquo;<em>fruitio</em>&rdquo;, traditionally translated
&ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo;) and pleasure in this.  The view seems to
apply also to the relation of pleasure to other acts of will on which
it may depend (including Ockham&rsquo;s &lsquo;middle acts&rsquo; that
merely take their objects to be noninstrumentally or intrinsically
good, without taking them to be, or not to be, most supremely and
ultimately good and desirable).  </p>

<p>

Ockham observes, in passing, that pleasure may be said, strictly
speaking, not to have an object (since it is not an act), as the act
of loving on which it depends does (2001, p.&nbsp;401 (445).  Kant&rsquo;s
discussion of the relations of aesthetic pleasure and judgment (e.g.,
Kant 1790/2000, &sect;9) has provoked similar philosophical
discussion about its proper interpretation, on whether this involves
such pleasure itself having intentionality or else its being distinct
from judgments that alone have this.  See Ginsborg 2014,
&sect;&sect;&nbsp;2.31 and 2.33.   </p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21" id="note-21">21.</a> Mulligan 2004,
pp.&nbsp;83&ndash;86 summarizes Brentano&rsquo;s earlier views as well as the
later ones discussed here. Chisholm 1986, 1987 and Katkov 1940,
pp.&nbsp;178&ndash;87 provide clear exposition and complementary
interpretations (see the Bibliography note on Katkov comparing these;
Mulligan 2004 is compatible with Katkov&rsquo;s reading) of Brentano&rsquo;s later
views, easier to read than Brentano&rsquo;s late dictated works. Brentano
1929/1981: Part I, iii, 5 and 7, pp.&nbsp;14 and 16; Part II, 1, 28;
p.&nbsp;59. Brentano 1921/1969, &sect;&sect;25&ndash;26a, pp.&nbsp;154&ndash;56,
for the treatment of intellectually caused pleasure interpreted in
Chisholm 1987, pp.&nbsp;61&ndash;63. The untranslated German of Brentano
1907/1979, n.&nbsp;39, pp.&nbsp;35&ndash;40, is also important; see the
Bibliography note on this.</p>

<p>

Brentano presumably draws, however indirectly, on medieval
Aristotelian scholastic sources, such as those mentioned in
n.&nbsp;20, just above, for his view of reflexive loving. He had a
thorough grounding in scholastic philosophy and aspired to found a
modern Christian philosophy on this model.  However, he was also strongly influenced
by Descartes and by the British empiricists as well.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22" id="note-22">22.</a> Attribution of
propositional attitudes at least sometimes may be only a pragmatic way of
speaking innocent of any substantive claims for an ontology of facts
or propositions or any attribution of combinatorial representational
powers of mind. For an early example of such a perspective, 
see Churchland 1979, pp. 100&ndash;107, for whom
abstract objects are used to conveniently index psychological events,
as numbers are used in physical science, without any commitment to these
abstract objects being involved substantively in either physical or
psychological structure.</p>

consistently uses &ldquo;enjoyment&rdquo; for the attitude, reserving
&ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; for &lsquo;sensations&rsquo; that are supposed to be
among enjoyment&rsquo;s objects, while Feldman distinguishes between
&lsquo;propositional&rsquo; or &lsquo;attitudinal pleasure&rsquo;
(which in his 2002 he identifies with enjoyment) and the
&lsquo;sensory pleasures&rsquo; that figure among its objects. Recent
philosophers&rsquo; explicit classification of pleasure as an attitude seems
to begin with Nowell-Smith (1954), pp.&nbsp;111&ndash;15, on which see the
Bibliography annotation and Perry 1967,
pp.&nbsp;204&ndash;14. Nowell-Smith&rsquo;s &lsquo;pro-attitudes&rsquo; lump together

<p>

Moore 1903, pp. 87&ndash;89. While Moore followed Brentano in adopting an
intentional (act/object or attitude/content) analysis of conscious
states generally, in this case he intends to be directly following
Plato. The possibility of such separation of bare affect from
cognitive awareness may arise in Plato, who although he at
<em>Timaeus</em> 64A&ndash;65B seems to take conscious feeling to be
required for pleasure, in the passage cited by Moore writes of
pleasure as though it is separable from full cognitive
awareness&nbsp;&ndash; but valueless to the subject then
(<em>Philebus</em> 21BC, 60DE). Aristotle seems to take a similar view
of pleasure during sleep (<em>Rhetoric</em> I,11:1370a15&ndash;16;
<em>EE</em> I,5:1216a2&ndash;5; <em>Politics</em>, VIII, 4:1339a16&ndash;18),
although it is unclear whether or how this can be accommodated to his
views of pleasure discussed in &sect;2.2.2.  But Locke seems to deny
the very possibility of pleasure during sleep (<em>Essay</em>
II,i,11). The sometimes peaceful appearance of sleepers, that sleep is
often desired and the process of falling asleep welcomed, and that
sleep typically leaves one refreshed, as pleasure typically does, pull toward
allowing that sleep is pleasant. Perhaps the difficulty of thinking of
sleep experiences as owned by subjects, when they neither are
cognitively aware of them at the time nor remember them later, counts
decisively for Locke against such pleasure in sleep being anyone&rsquo;s
pleasure and therefore against its being pleasure at all. However,
perhaps taking place in an organism is ownership enough. And on a
neoBuddhist or neoHumean view that requires no subject beyond
particular experiences, even an isolated experience of the right kind
might unproblematically be pleasure on its own, however unowned by any
continuant subject of experience.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27" id="note-27">27.</a> Berridge and
Winkielman 2003. That affective processes underlying pleasure may
proceed without awareness is widely allowed in recent scientific
literature; e.g., LeDoux 1996; Berridge 1996; pp.&nbsp;19&ndash;21; Berridge
1999; pp.&nbsp;525&ndash;37; Winkielman and Berridge 2003; Berridge 2004;
Winkielman, Berridge and Wilbarger 2005; Damasio 1999; Shizgal 1999;
Frijda 2001, pp.&nbsp;75&ndash;78; Davidson 2003. However, usually no
distinction such as Block&rsquo;s is intended, but only that neural,
cognitive or behavioral components of emotional response, without any
consciousness of any kind, may thus occur. (Lane 2000 is an exception; he seems to
be working with a distinction and vocabulary similar to, although not
drawn from, Block&rsquo;s.) Contrast Locke, for whom such &ldquo;[t]hings in
their present enjoyment are what they seem; the apparent and real good
are, in this case, always the same. For the Pain or Pleasure being
just so great, and no greater, than it is felt, the present Good or
Evil is really so much as it appears&rdquo; (Essay, II, xxi, 58).
&ldquo;Therefore, as to present Pleasure and Pain the Mind, as has
been said, never mistakes that which is really good and evil; that
which is the greater Pleasure, or the lesser Pain, is really as it
appears&rdquo; (II, xxi, 63). Cf. the similar Epicurean view as
reported in Cicero, <em>de finibus</em> I, 33 and 55. But cognitive
processing is a matter of degree and there may be room for pleasure or
pain to be felt and matter to our well- or ill-being without any
cognitively sophisticated appearing or seeming. There seem to be
distinct verbal, psychological, and practical questions at issue here:
whether the word &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; is to be tied to full
cognitive awareness, whether immediate feeling of some kind may be
present unnoticed in various ways, and, if so, what rational or moral
claims our own (or is it unowned?) unnoticed pleasure and pain, and
similarly unnoticed fetal or animal pleasure and pain, have on our
prudence, conscience, compassion, and care. See Ekman and Davidson,
1994, Question 8: &ldquo;Can Emotions Be Nonconscious&rdquo;, pp.
283&ndash;318, for discussion of that issue and also the Bibliography note
to Zajonc 1994, which appears in that section. Gerald Clore&rsquo;s
contribution there takes the view that emotion is (as a conceptual
matter) conscious; &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; is used with a similar
implication by Damasio (1999, 2003) Craig (2002, 2009, 2015) and now by Berridge and his
collaborators. But scientists generally agree that conscious affects
include or involve component processes that may exist in the absence
of consciousness or at least of full awareness; the view that
pleasure&rsquo;s nature is exhausted by its being perceived as such seems
unrepresented, at least among scientists, nowadays. But again, the
difference with Locke may be in large part verbal; emotion and
pleasure, for the scientists, include totally nonconscious
processes.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28" id="note-28">28.</a> Sidgwick, 1907,
pp. 125&ndash;27. Sidgwick&rsquo;s quotations are, respectively, from Herbert
Spencer and Alexander Bain. Daniel Kahneman&rsquo;s (1999, p.&nbsp;4)
definition, in terms of strength of a disposition to continue, faces
similar problems&nbsp;&ndash; as also do Richard Brandt&rsquo;s (1979,
pp.&nbsp;40&ndash;41) and Derek Parfit&rsquo;s (1984, p.&nbsp;493).  Excitement
certainly seems not reducible to pleasure; someone excited can be
either happy or having a panic attack.  Alternative accounts of
activation or arousal exist.  One is that this is a single
psychologically basic dimension independent of pleasure (J.A.
Russell; e.g., in his 1991 and in Russell and Barrett 1999). On
another, its magnitude derives from those of positive affect and
negative affect summed together (David Watson; e.g., in his 2000).
But there may well be multiple &lsquo;arousal&rsquo; or
&lsquo;activation&rsquo; systems in the brain, some often closely
connected with affect or motivation but others not.  For further
references and discussion, see n.&nbsp;29 below and the accompanying
text in &sect;3.3.</p>

<p>

Vasubandhu, the Kashmiri-educated Buddhist from Peshawar (c. 400
C.E.), whose <em>Abhidharmako&#347;a</em>
 (1923&ndash;31) is a foundational psychological text for Northern
Buddhists, avoided defining pleasure (<em>sukha</em>) in terms of
current desire by defining it instead through desire for it
arising after it has stopped (1984, p.&nbsp;66).  This allows calm,
desireless pleasure, but remains relational and seems silent about states
that are unending or otherwise not followed by others. And it seems to be
falsified by Plato&rsquo;s example of a fragrance that we enjoy but do not
miss once it is gone. (But perhaps there is a very short-term desire
in such cases that goes unnoticed especially when we have other things
to experience or do. And if only a typical functional connection or
causal tendency were intended, the earlier counterexamples might be
handled as well. However, such a relational characterization would not
provide a real definition of an
intrinsically constituted state, such as pleasure would be on the simple picture and,
it seems, on some Buddhist views as well.)</p>

<p>

Bertrand Russell, in his behaviorist-influenced 1921, also accomodates
inactive pleasure by analyzing pleasure relationally and negatively,
as the property of mental occurrences consisting in their stimulating
no reflex or voluntary movements that do not tend to prolong the
stimulating occurrences themselves (1921, pp.&nbsp;71&ndash;72). This seems
too broad, if it includes states of freezing in fright and of
motionless depression. It seems also too narrow, if it excludes
anything that causes a consummatory act that ends the appetitive
motivation that formerly sustained it, as eating, drinking, and male
sexual activity typically do. Swallowing may be caused by tasting, but
that does not show that the taste was not pleasant, although more
prolonged savoring may show that someone enjoys something
more&nbsp;&ndash; and similarly for the other cases. (Since events in a
complex system typically have many effects, and these effects will as
well, doubly negative analyses such as Russell&rsquo;s seem especially
unpromising.)  Purely behavioral or motivational analyses, it seems,
will not do. To the extent that ones in terms of accepting or
attending to a stimulus come closer to the mark (Frijda 2001,
pp. 76&ndash;78), this may be because they build pleasure into the account
rather than analyzing it in other terms. Russell came close to this in
his 1930/1968, pp.&nbsp;155&ndash;57/110&ndash;111, as detailed in n.&nbsp;25
alongside similar views. The accompanying text at the end of &sect;2.3 is also relevant.</p>



 

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29" id="note-29">29.</a> Similarly in 1896
Wilhelm Wundt, the founder of German experimental psychology, proposed
a three-dimensional theory of affect, with excitement/depression and
tension (or action-tendency)/relaxation, figuring alongside
pleasure/pain. This last <em>Gef&uuml;hlston</em> dimension became hedonic tone in English translation and under that name and later as valence became standard in psychological literature.  (Appeal to this as an uncontroversial feature of affective experience in Katz 1986, p. 47, without citation, was misunderstood in Kagan 1992, 172&ndash;3, as original, with the result that one or both of these are credited for the idea in recent philosophical
literature.)  For discussion and interpretation of changes in Wundt&rsquo;s
views before and after this first edition, see Titchener 1908,
Ch. IV. For similar neurologically-supported more recent views, see
Heilman 2000 and Heller, Koven, and Miller 2003, which also raises
doubts about the adequacy of dimensional approaches to affect.
Controversies over the number of dimensions, which axes to privilege,
and whether pleasure and pain are opposites (or instead, perhaps, to
be identified, respectively, with Wundt&rsquo;s action-tendency and
depression, which would approximate to David Watson&rsquo;s view) have
continued to the present day. For literature of the debate on the
dimensional structure of emotion space, see the special section of the
<em>Journal of Personality and Social Psychology</em>, 76:803&ndash;64 for
May, 1999 (Diener 1999) and, for an application with bearing on our
topic, Depue and Collins, 1999. James Russell is a leading exponent of
positive and negative affect (pleasure and pain) as polar opposites;
John Cacioppo (see his 1999 and Ito and Cacioppo 1999 and 2001) among
the opponents (while acknowledging that the two tend to exclude each
other at high intensities) as are David Watson and Robert Thayer,
discussed in n.&nbsp;1, &para;&para;4 and 5 above. This controversy
may be settled at some levels by the advance of neuroscience, but
cultural and individual differences, which interact with sex and
gender, may defeat any single overall answer&nbsp;&ndash; at least at
the level of self-report. (For example, it is sometimes said that
traditionally Chinese women have been socialized to be indifferent
<em>to</em>, or even to feel bad <em>about</em>, their own feeling
good.)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30" id="note-30">30.</a> Epicurus&rsquo; precise interpretation is sometimes difficult and controversial due to loss of most of Epicurus&rsquo; own writings.  For the mainly fragmentary 
surviving writings see 1994 and Long and Sedley
1987.  For further discussion supporting varying interpretations, beyond that cited in &sect;2.23 above, see
Merlan 1960; Gosling and Taylor 1982, Ch.&nbsp;19, pp.&nbsp;365&ndash;96;
Mitsis 1987; Striker 1993; Preuss 1994, Ch.&nbsp;Six (which discusses
earlier interpretations at length before giving his own).
On the Stoics, see Long and Sedley (texts in
&sect;&sect;57 and 65, in both volumes), Seneca 1917&ndash;25, Sorabji 2000,
Nussbaum 1994 and 2001.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31" id="note-31">31.</a> Aristotle (<em>NE</em>
I,viii:1099a24&ndash;31 and <em>EE</em> I,i:1214a1&ndash;6) criticizes a poem
(sometimes credited to Theognis of Megara) for stating that the most
pleasant thing is to attain what one desires. Modern Western society
and philosophers (e.g., Hobbes, <em>De Homine</em>, 11, &para;15;
1658/1991, p. 54), in contrast, have often privileged desire in their
views of human nature and value. The modern disparagement of calm and
contentment as complacency and the talk of &lsquo;change&rsquo; as
if all change were good reverse the predominant bias in favor of
stability and calm in many traditional societies and past
civilizations, expressed, for example, in Plato&rsquo;s and Aristotle&rsquo;s view
of the best life and society. For recent social criticism advocating
increasing appetites to achieve &lsquo;pleasure&rsquo; (rather than
habituating &lsquo;comfort&rsquo;), see the economist Tibor
Scitovsky&rsquo;s <em>The Joyless Society</em> (1992/1976), Ch.&nbsp;Four,
&ldquo;Pleasure Versus Comfort&rdquo;. The science used there is
rather old; Kahneman 1999, pp. 13ff., provides some critical
discussion and references toward what would be needed for an updated
appraisal.  Scitovsky seems to suppose that pleasure derives from a
single underlying arousal dimension; pleasure is return toward an
optimal level of this (much as it is return to something like
homeostatic equilibrium for Plato, &sect;2.2.1 above).</p>

<h2><a id="Econtent"></a>1. Entry Substance, Style and Length</h2> 

<p>
 The <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> is intended to serve
as an authoritative reference work suitable for use by professionals
and students in the field of philosophy, as well as by all others
interested in authoritative discussions on philosophical topics.
Entries should therefore be scholarly, written with the highest of
professional standards, yet strive to be of interest to as wide an
audience as possible. Entries should focus on the philosophical issues
and arguments rather than on sociology and individuals, particularly
in discussions of topics in contemporary philosophy. In other words,
entries should be &ldquo;idea-driven&rdquo; rather than
&ldquo;person-driven&rdquo;.  One indication that the entry is
&ldquo;person-driven&rdquo; is that the section and subsection titles
invoke the names of philosophers; this should be avoided, though the
editors may make an exception if the entry is primarily historical in
character. (If in doubt, check with the editors.)  Non-historical,
concept-based entries should therefore focus on <em>the philosophical
problems to be solved</em> and on the extent to which distinctions,
ideas, concepts, or arguments being put forward solve the problem. The
internal logic of these distinctions, ideas and arguments should
therefore drive the discussion, so that the reader will more
frequently encounter sentences that <i>cite</i> philosophers without
coming across as being <i>about</i> them.</p>

<p>
Authors should try to structure the entry so as to organize the ideas
into common themes and avoid where possible straight historical
presentations of &ldquo;who said what when and where&rdquo;.  Entries
should avoid having numerous sentences of the form &ldquo;X (1960, 11)
argues that &hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;Y responds that &hellip; (1964,
8)&rdquo;, &ldquo;Z additionally requires (1970, 2) that
&hellip;&rdquo;, etc.  Rather, the ideas and arguments should, at
least much more often than not, be the focus of the sentences, with
inline, parenthetical citations at the end of the sentence that
document the source of the idea, argument, etc.  Biographical entries
should be critical (i.e., include mention and explanation of works
critical of the subject's ideas) and not be hagiographical.  Authors
should strive to <em>minimize the use of jargon</em>, and introduce
technical terms in plain or previously defined language.  Technical
entries will be expected to include definitions of the technical terms
used.</p>

<p>The sources of all quotations should be clearly identified.  In
addition, authors should avoid reference to unpublished and
inaccessible materials. </p>

<p>
 Entries should be objective/neutral analyses/surveys of the
literature and offer a broad perspective of the topic rather than
advocate a point of view.  Authors should see their mission as that of
introducing advanced undergraduates (or grad students and colleagues),
who may have no special knowledge of the topic, to the main issues and
arguments discussed in the most important pieces of primary and
secondary literature on the topic, so as to bring their readers to a
state where they can read that literature with insight and
understanding. SEP entries should have no other agenda than to achieve
this mission in a way that the balance of discussion in the entry is
in proportion to, and reflects, the balance in the literature.
Clarity of substance and style should also be one of the most
important goals.</p>

<p>
  <em>Encyclopedia</em> entries should therefore not be idiosyncratic
or polemical, and should avoid &lsquo;editorializing&rsquo; value
judgments in the voice of the entry.  The entry should not promote the
author's work, but rather strive for balance by presenting the
important arguments that have been put forward on both sides of an
issue.  Controversial claims should be identified as such.  Authors
should not use the first person pronouns &ldquo;I&rdquo;,
&ldquo;me&rdquo;, &ldquo;my&rdquo; (or &ldquo;we&rdquo;,
&ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo; -- if the entry is coauthored)
and should avoid such constructions as &ldquo;as I (we) have argued
(elsewhere/previously/in this essay) &hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;my
(our) interpretation of this passage is &hellip;&rdquo;, etc.  Authors
should not use their SEP entry to raise and advocate for or respond
and defend against objections if those objections and responses aren't
already in the published literature.  Authors may, however, illuminate
various sides of an issue by presenting potential objections and
responses as long as the entry remains neutral and/or reflects the
weight of scholarly opinion.</p>

<p>  
Finally, authors should also be circumspect with respect to the number
of references to their own work, though obviously, since they are
experts on the topic and typically will have written widely on it,
occasional references may be appropriate.  The editors of
the <em>Encyclopedia</em> will ensure that entries do not overstep the
bounds of propriety in this regard.</p>

 <blockquote>
 <small>
 SEP policy is that authors should not cite their own dissertations. 
 Authors who believe that it is necessary should seek an exception
 beforehand. The SEP editors will then provide a list of criteria
 that need to be met and if the author demonstrates that those
 criteria are satisfied, permission may be given. 
 </small>
</blockquote>


<p> The length of entries should depend on the topic.  SEP entries now
average 12,000 words, but may be somewhat longer if the topic is broad
and there is much literature to introduce and explain.  Please contact
us if the entry looks like it will grow to more than 12,000 words. We
encourage authors to organize longer entries by writing a set of
nested, cross-linked documents rather than by writing a single, linear
document.  By this we mean that overly detailed, highly technical, or
highly scholarly material should be put into separate HTML
(&ldquo;supplementary&rdquo;) documents and linked into the main
entry.  (See below.)  In such circumstances the main (index.html) file
for the entry should still provide a comprehensive overview of the
entire topic.  This way, the main entry should become readable by an
intelligent undergraduate in a sitting of about an hour or two.  More
advanced readers can follow the links to the highly technical,
detailed or scholarly material.  Such a cross-linked set of documents
will therefore be accessible to a wide audience.  However, authors
should create such &ldquo;nested&rdquo; entries only if it seems
unlikely that a separate entry in the <em>Encyclopedia</em> will be
created to discuss the supplementary material.</p>


<h2><a id="write"></a>2. Writing Your Entry in Word or LaTeX</h2> 

<p>
Assuming that authors submit a document that is within the normal
range of an average SEP entry, then the author may submit either a
Word (or RTF) document, or a LaTeX document.  SEP document
editors will convert Word and LaTeX documents to HTML. Because
the <em>Encyclopedia</em> is being served over the World Wide Web, all
entries must eventually be formatted in the HTML (HyperText Markup
Language) document format for delivery over the web. This is the
formatting language that controls the way text, graphics, and links
are displayed in web browsers.  Entries prepared using other document
formats have to be converted to HTML.</p>

<p>Normally, the SEP will help authors convert entries prepared in
Word, RTF, or LaTeX into HTML.  However, authors should be aware that,
unless they use LaTeX, the SEP doesn't have the resources to convert
especially long entries or entries that have lengthy and detailed
mathematical or logical formatting.  LaTeX is the preferred format for
such entries, since we now use HTML/MathJax, which allows us to
embed LaTeX formatting tags within an HTML document (see
  <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/" target="other">MathJax</a>
Authors that use other formats for these kinds of submission may be
asked to provide some assistance, either by doing the conversion
themselves or by reimbursing the SEP for the extra time its document
editors must spend converting and formatting the documents in
HTML. (All our documents are now being prepared so that they parse as
valid forms of the version of HTML known &ldquo;XHTML 1.0 Transitional&rdquo;.
This is just HTML 4 written in an XML language.)</p>

<p>Please note that there are special instructions to follow
for Entry Revision.  See the section on 
  <a href="#revision">Entry Revision</a> below.</p>

<p>
 To begin writing an entry, authors should follow our instructions for
downloading the sourcefile of the &ldquo;Entry Template&rdquo;. (These
instructions were sent to you when you accepted your commission and
they indicate that you can download the template by logging onto the
authors' web interface, for which you have a login ID and password.)
Alternatively, you may obtain the template directly from:</p> <ul>
  <li><a href="entries/template/index.doc">Word Template</a> (.doc)</li>
  <li><a href="entries/template/index.docx">Word Template</a> (.docx)</li>
  <li><a href="entries/template/index.tex">LaTeX Template</a> (.tex)</li>
  </ul>

<p>
Once the template is downloaded, the author may simply &ldquo;Open&rdquo; that
file in Word, or use it as the basis of a LaTeX document. </p>


<h2><a id="format"></a>3. Entry Format</h2>

<p>
 The following constitute the &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; sections
of an SEP entry.  Each section must be present, though the
final Acknowledgments section is optional.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#intro">Introduction (Definition)</a></li>
  <li><a href="#intlinks">Internal Links</a></li>
  <li><a href="#main">Main Sections of the Entry</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Bib">Bibliography</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Aca">Academic Tools</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Rel">Related Entries</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Ack">Acknowledgments</a> (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>
 These are discussed in turn. </p>


<h3><a id="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>
 The Introduction should contain a brief definition of the subject.
This may take one or two paragraphs, and if possible, these paragraphs
should contain some statement of the subject's interest and
significance.  The main topics to be covered in the body of the entry
may be mentioned here, so that the reader will get some idea of what
is to follow.</p>

<h3><a id="intlinks"></a>Internal Links</h3>

<p>
 The internal links should be a list of the main sections of the
entry, and each item in the list should be a link to that section.
The HTML commands needed to do this are included in the template and
in the annotated sourcefile.</p>

<h3><a id="main"></a>Main Sections of the Entry</h3>

<p>
  The structure and sectioning of the entry is at the discretion of
the author.  However, SEP sections should be numbered using the
following scheme:</p>

<blockquote>
  1. Section One<br/>
  2. Section Two<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.1 Subsection one of Section Two<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2.2 Subsection two of Section Two<br/>
  3. Section Three<br/> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1 Subsection one of Section Three<br/>  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1.1 Subsubsection one of Subsection 3.1<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3.1.2 Subsubsection two of Subsection 3.1<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3.2 Subsection two of Section Three
</blockquote>

<p>Subsections and subsubsections should not be introduced unless
there are at least two of them. </p>

<p>We encourage authors to include a Chronology or &ldquo;Life&rdquo; section in
Biographical entries.  Moreover, a &ldquo;History&rdquo; section is called for in
the discussion of many topics.</p>

<h3><a id="Bib"></a>Bibliography</h3>

<h4>SEP House Style for Bibliographies</h4>

<p>
 Please use the following bibliographic format:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="hanging">

 of Snarks&rdquo;, <em>Journal of Ornithology</em>, 25(1):

Wallace Tate (ed.) 1999b, pp. 32&ndash;42.</li>

 </ul>

</blockquote>

<p>
With this style of Bibliography, you can then cite these sources in
your main text in the following ways, with placement of parentheses
dependent on whether you are referring to the author, the
work, or both, respectively:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Terrell (1888 [1999, 7]) claims that snarks gimble on New England
ponds in the early spring.</li>
 <li>It is argued in Hanes 1999a (Ch. 4) that bandersnatches can
cause environmental damage.</li>
 <li>Some authors have claimed that snarks are extinct (Dodgson 1885,
23).  </li>
 </ul>

<p>
 Please note that we strive to eliminate the use of dates that would
mislead the reader into thinking that work is published much later.
So please avoid such anachronisms as &ldquo;Plato 1962&rdquo;,
&ldquo;Locke 1950&rdquo;, &ldquo;Confucius 2003&rdquo;, etc. Instead,
in the case where publication dates are not known, please just cite
the title of the work.  E.g., in a sentence discussing one of Plato's
dialogues, you can simply cite &ldquo;(<em>Parmenides</em>,
132a-b)&rdquo;, and then list this in the Bibliography as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul class="hanging">
  <li>Plato, <em>Parmenides</em>, in <em>Plato: Complete Works</em>,
  John Cooper and Douglas Hutchinson (eds.), Indianapolis: Hackett,
  1997.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, cite sections of Locke's <em>Essay</em> by section
number rather than by page number, so that those with other editions
can find the passage you cite.  So, for example, to cite
Locke's <em>Two Treatises of Government</em>, you could refer to it as
&ldquo;Locke 1689&rdquo; in the text (using the original year of
publication), and then include the following listing in the
Bibliography:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="hanging">
 <li>Locke, John, 1689, <em>Two Treatises of Government</em>,
in Peter Laslett (ed.), <em>Locke's Two Treatises of Government</em>, 
Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960.</li>
 </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
And for citing Confucius&rsquo; <em>Analects</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="hanging">
 <li>Confucius, <em>Analects</em>, Edward Slingerland (trans.), 
Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2003.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p> 
 Please also note: (1) The Bibliography section may be divided into
subsections such as Primary Literature and Secondary Literature,
or References Cited and Other Important Works, etc. and
(2) The Bibliography is reserved primarily for <em>refereed</em>
material, whether print-based or on the web.</p>



<h4>Citations to Online Materials</h4>

<p>
  Citations to online materials require special handling. If a journal
article appears in an electronic journal that isn't printed, then a
full URL should be identified.  E.g., you would reference Alexander
George's entry in the <em>Philosopher's Imprint</em> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="hanging">
<li>Chadha, Monima and Shaun Nichols, 2019, &ldquo;Self-Conscious
Emotions Without a Self&rdquo;, <em>Philosopher&rsquo;s Imprint</em>,
19(38): 1&ndash;16 
[<a href="http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.3521354.0019.038" target="other">Chadha and Nichols 2019 available online</a>].</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
 However, sometimes an article is primarily in a print-based journal.
That journal may have an online version, or the journal may not have
an electronic version but instead the author has put a preprint at an
archive site or on their own web page.  We encourage authors to create
links to online versions of refereed, published material, even if the
only version online is a preprint of something that has been
published.  In these cases, a URL need not be identified explicitly
(since the print publication information will suffice), but a
specially annotated link should be included, as follows: </p>

 <ol type="a">
 <li>Links which lead to online versions of a published paper or book
 at the <em>publisher</em>'s website, should be annotated 
 &ldquo;[Available online]&rdquo;.  These are independent archival
versions, and any changes to the articles must conform with the
policies of the publisher.  Note that the SEP accepts links only to
material that is freely available on the web.</li>
 <li>Links which lead to online preprints of a published paper at an
<em>independent</em> archive site should be annotated &ldquo;[Preprint
available online]&rdquo;.  Since the preprint site is an independent
archive, the author must conform to their policies for making changes
to the preprinted articles.</li>
 <li>Links which lead to online preprints or reprints of a published
article at the <em>author</em>'s website should be annotated
&ldquo;[Preprint available from the author]&rdquo; or &ldquo;[Reprint available from the
author]&rdquo;, respectively.  This applies even to PDF reprints sent to the
author from the publisher and hosted on the author's site, or scanned
versions which the author has made of material published elsewhere.
The reader should know that this is not an independent &ldquo;archival&rdquo;
version.  In cases where it is unclear whether the author's web site
is serving a preprint or a reprint, the default annotation should be
&ldquo;[Preprint available from the author]&rdquo;.</li>
 </ol>

<p>None of the above applies if the article to be cited is not
published or forthcoming in a refereed journal.  In such cases, if the
online material is simply self-archived (possibly on a preprint site
such as arXiv.org or on the author's home page), then the citation
information for references to those articles should be put into the
Other Internet Resources section of the entry, possibly in a special
&ldquo;Preprint&rdquo; section.</p>

<h4>How to Cite SEP Entries in the Bibliography</h4>

<p>
 Sometimes an author will have occasion to cite another SEP entry in
the Bibliography, as opposed to just listing other SEP entries in the
Related Entries section.  (For example, if an author quotes a passage
from another SEP entry.)  Proper citation of SEP entries in the
Bibliography should follow our citation guidelines, which indicate
that one should cite only an &ldquo;archived&rdquo; version of an SEP
entry.  To cite an SEP entry in your Bibliography, such as Sukjae
Lee&rsquo;s entry on Occasionalism, you would list it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="hanging">

<li>Lee, Sukjae, &ldquo;Occasionalism&rdquo;, <em>The Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> (Fall 2020 Edition), Edward N. Zalta
(ed.), URL = 
 &lt;<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2020/entries/occasionalism/">https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2020/entries/occasionalism/</a>&gt;.</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>

<h3><a id="Aca"></a>Academic Tools</h3>

<p>This section will be generated automatically by the
SEP system.  Authors need not add any content to this
section.</p> 

<h3><a id="Oth"></a>Other Internet Resources</h3>

<p>
  The author should cite material on the web that is of excellent
value but which may not have undergone a referee process.  The author
serves as referee for these materials (and our subject editors will
referee these choices).  The items listed in this section can be
segregated into subsections, such as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <strong>Online Manuscripts</strong> <br />
    &hellip; <br />
  <strong>Websites</strong> <br />
   &hellip;
</blockquote>

<p>

To complete this section, authors are encouraged to conduct an online
search of the web for webpages and websites with <em>high-quality,
academic content</em> on the topic in question.  Such webpages and
websites should be written and maintained by qualified individuals
having a clear expertise on the topic.  The task of finding such
external websites is made considerably simpler by using one of the
premier search engines which rank sites on the basis of the number of
links to them on the web (i.e., these links are like web citations).
Here are some useful ones:</p>

  <blockquote>
<!-- <a href="http://noesis.evansville.edu/">Noesis</a>
 <br />-->
<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="other">Google</a>
  </blockquote> 

<p>
 Please do not create links to websites that are not maintained by
qualified individuals.  In addition, authors should <em>not</em> link
to their own homepages or to their own list of online publications,
though if you have an online publication that is relevant to your
topic, it may be appropriate to include a link to it along with other
online papers that are relevant to the topic.  (Remember that the
Bibliography section is reserved for refereed publications and so if
your online paper has also been refereed and published somewhere, it
should be included in the Bibliography, if cited in the body of your
entry, and not in the Other Internet Resources section.)  Again, our
subject editors will check that self-citations are within the bounds
of propriety.</p>

<p>
 Finally, the SEP prefers not to create links to websites or webpages
that are behind subscription walls, since this disenfranchises those
of our readers who cannot afford to pay the price of admission.
So please confine the links you create here to &ldquo;open access&rdquo;
resources.</p>


<h3><a id="Rel"></a>Related Entries</h3>

<p>
 Please list the names of the most important concepts and philosophers
that occur in your entry.  You may list keywords that do not appear as
topics in our Table of Contents if you feel that they are important.
We are running software which will notice the discrepancy and alert
the Editor.  A decision will be made whether or not to include a new
entry on that topic.  If we decide that the topic is too specialized
or otherwise inappropriate for the <em>Encyclopedia</em>, we will
eliminate this keyword from your list in the Related Entries
section.</p>

<h3><a id="Ack"></a>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>This section is optional.  A short paragraph thanking
those who contributed to the high quality of the entry is
in order, however.</p> 

<h2><a id="revision"></a>4. Entry Revision</h2> 


<p>
 Because the <em>Encyclopedia</em> is designed to be a dynamic
reference work, authors are responsible for maintaining and
periodically updating their entries. Specifically, authors are
expected: (1) to update their entries regularly, especially in
response to important new research on the topic of the entry, and (2)
to revise their entries <em>in a timely way</em> in light of any valid
criticism they receive, whether it comes from the subject editors on
our Editorial Board, other members of the profession, or interested
readers.  In connection with (1), authors should update the
Bibliography and the Other Internet Resources sections of their
entries regularly, to keep pace with significant new publications,
both in print and on the web.  If important new publications affect
the currency of the main text, then the main text should be altered so
as to reflect the important ideas in the new research.  In
connection with (2), the validity of criticism shall be determined by
the Editor, typically in consultation with the relevant members of the
Editorial Board.  The length of time required for a &ldquo;timely&rdquo; revision
will be negotiable and will both respect the author's current
commitments and reflect the seriousness of the criticism.  However,
entries which require revision but which are not revised within the
negotiated timetable may be retired from the active portion of
the <em>Encyclopedia</em> and left in the
<em>Encyclopedia</em> Archives until such time as the entry is revised
so as to engage the valid criticisms in question.</p>

<h3>How to Revise Your Entry</h3>

<!-- If we change something here, be sure to change it
  in instructions.html in /usr/local/encyclopedia/privatedocs/authors/
-->

<blockquote>

entry and revising it in in Word or your own HTML editor.  That will
corrupt the file.  Please follow the instructions below.</span></td>
 </tr>
 </table>

 </tr>
 </table>
</blockquote>


<h4>Making Modifications:</h4>

<p>
 There is a preferred, recommended, and easy-to-use protocol for
making minor changes to your entry.  If you would like to add/revise a
paragraph, add an item to the Bibliography, fix a typo, etc., then the
proper procedure to follow is to log in to our Author Area:</p>

 <blockquote>
  <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/authors.cgi">https://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/authors.cgi</a>
 </blockquote>

<p>
 and initiate the action &ldquo;Revise Entry on Server&rdquo;.  This will allow
you to directly edit a copy of your entry on our machine (from
whichever browser you are using).  There is an Instructions/Help file
for using this software.  However, as you will see, when you use the
Revise Entry function, you will be prompted to select the file you
wish to edit.  In most cases, you will select the main document, which
is called &ldquo;index.html&rdquo; (some entries have multiple files, e.g., a main
document &ldquo;index.html&rdquo; and supplementary documents).  Note that 
when selecting the file, you have the option to:</p>

 <ul>
 <li>Edit a copy of the entry by using a Word-like (graphical) WYSIWYG (&ldquo;what
you see is what you get&rdquo;) editor.</li>
 <li>Edit a copy of the HTML sourcefile directly through your browser.

 </ul>

<p>
If you choose the first option, to edit the file using a graphical,
Word-like HTML editor:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>a new browser window will open up and you will be presented
with a formatted and editable copy of your entry, with menu items at the top
for adding italics, bold, etc. This should be familiar to you, as
the menu icons for editing the entry will be similar to those you 
would use in Microsoft Word.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>
If you choose the second option, to edit the HTML source:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>a new browser window will open up and you will be presented
with a page on which the file you wanted to edit is divided up into
segments, each containing a &ldquo;View&rdquo; box and an &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; box.  You will
find the material you wish to edit in the View box, since the text in
this box is rendered, or formatted, HTML.  Then you edit in the
corresponding Edit box, which contains the HTML sourcefile (which is
plain text with markup tags).  It should be clear how to add content
in the Edit box.</p>
 
  <p><span style="color:red">If you choose this option, please do not
cut and paste from a Word document into an editing window unless you
(1) first save the Word document as a &ldquo;plain text&rdquo; file, and then (2)
cut and paste from the plain text file. Moreover, please do not cut
and paste from a Word-generated HTML file into an editing window box
unless you are sure that you are not pasting corrupted HTML code.  You
can cut and paste in HTML code, but you should be able to see the code
itself and determine that it is simple HTML and not something that
looks overly complicated.</span></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Every so often, you should SAVE your work, using the Save buttons at
the left or at the top of the page.  You may SAVE your work without
submitting it for review, but when you believe you have completed the
revisions you need to make, use the Save/Submit option, or return to
the authors main menu page and use the Submit/Resubmit Privates Files
to Editor function.</p>

<p>
 The above procedure will work for most major, as well as minor
modifications.  If you wish to make a structural change to your entry,
then the editors would be happy to help you reorganize the HTML in the
file.  They can create new sections and rearrange others.  They can
get the file into a state where you can then use the Revise Entry on
Server function.</p>

<p>
 Please note: If you are <em>revising</em> your entry, and you want to
add or delete a footnote, you do not need to renumber the footnotes by
hand.  We have a script which will do this automatically.  Please
simply bring it to our attention and we renumber the notes for you.
</p> 


<h4>Significant Structural Revisions or Rewriting Published Entries:</h4>

<p>
 In some rare cases, where authors plan to make significant structural
revisions or to rewrite their entries, they may write to us to obtain
permission to update using Word or LaTeX. In that case, we will
prepare a file for them to edit &ndash; we'll make sure that we
generate a file in the appropriate format from the currently published
entry.

<p>
In some still rarer cases, authors who can use a plain text editor to
write raw HTML code can contact us and let us know that they are
capable of doing so. We'll then send you a current HTML sourcefile to
edit. We might ask to set up a test, to check that your plain text
editor is not damaging the file.</p>

<h2><a id="footnotes"></a>5. The Use of Footnotes</h2>

<p>
 Footnotes may be included.  They can often help to shorten the main
page of the entry to make it more readable.  Please note, however,
that they should not be used solely for citations, or even lists of
citations.  All citations should be included in the main text in
parentheses, in the following format: (Author Year, page).  Multiple
citations should be separated by a semicolon.</p>

<p>
 Please note: If you are <em>revising</em> your entry, and you want to
add or delete a footnote, you do not need to renumber the footnotes by
hand.  We have a script which will do this automatically.  Please
simply bring it to our attention and we renumber the notes for you.
</p> 


<h2><a id="symbols"></a>6. The Use of Special Symbols</h2>

<p>Modern web browsers can now support most Unicode characters.
So most of the characters used in Word and LaTeX can be converted
to similar characters in HTML.  There are some exceptions, however.
In general, when writing an SEP entry in Word or LaTeX, it is best
to stick to well-known and widely used symbols.</p>

<p>
If you have decided to write your entry in HTML, then as you read the
final section below, note the subsection on Using Special
Characters.</p>


<h2><a id="writeHTML"></a>7. If You Choose To Write Your Entry in HTML (Optional)</h2> 

<p>
 We have adopted the &ldquo;XHTML 1.0 Transitional&rdquo; markup language as the
standard for formatting <i>Encyclopedia</i> entries. If you choose to write
your entry in HTML, you must submit a file that parses as valid XHTML
1.0 Transitional, according to the validating service at:</p>

 <ul>
 <li><a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a></li>
 </ul>

<p>It is far more work for us to fix broken HTML than it is to convert
Word or LaTeX documents to HTML.  So, unless you are confident that
you can produce HTML that is clean and internationally compliant, we
recommend that you use Word or LaTeX.  </p>

<p>For those who choose to submit an HTML sourcefile, you have
two options: (a) write the document in raw HTML without the assistance
of an HTML-editor, or (b) use an HTML-editor to graphically edit and
format your document.  In either case, you will need to download either our 
 <a href="entries/sample/sample.gz">Tar/Gzipped Annotated Sourcefiles</a>,
or the
  <a href="entries/template/index.html">HTML Entry Template</a>.  The
Annotated Sourcefiles include &ldquo;HTML comments&rdquo; that explain
the formatting, and include sample content that will have to be
replaced by your own content.  The Entry Template, by contrast, has no
annotations or sample content.  Once you download, unzip, and untar
the Sourcefiles, or download the Entry Template file, you can open the
HTML files in a plain text editor or a graphical HTML-editor and
begin editing. (Note: if you want to see the annotations in the
annotated sourcefiles, these will have to be opened in a plain
text editor, for the HTML formatting code makes the comments
invisible when rendered by graphical HTML-editing systems.) </p>

<h3><a name="sup-links">Linking from the Main Entry to Supplementary Documents</a></h3>

<p>
 Note that it is easy to create a link from your main entry to
supplementary documents containing overly technical or scholarly
material that would interfere with the presentation of the main
ideas.  To create a link from the main document to a supplementary
document, suppose that the main document is entitled &ldquo;index.html&rdquo; and
the supplementary document is entitled &ldquo;supplement.html&rdquo;.  Now
suppose that at the end of a paragraph, you wish place a labeled link
to the supplementary document.  Here is what the link might be
displayed as:</p>
  <blockquote>
  ... .  We discuss this last point in further detail in the following
supplementary document:
    <blockquote>
    <a href="entries/sample/supplement.html">Supplement on [Title of Supplement]</a>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<p>
 Authors using an HTML-editor will have to use the functions provided
by their software to create such a link.  However, authors who can
edit their HTML sourcefiles directly would insert the following HTML
code in order to produce this link to the supplementary document:</p>

  <blockquote>
  ...in the following supplementary document. <br />
    &lt;blockquote&gt;<br />
  &lt;a href="supplement.html" id="return-1"&gt;Supplement on [Title of Supplement]&lt;/a&gt;<br />
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  </blockquote>

<p>
 Note that this can be done in other places in your main document, if 
you have more than one supplementary document.  (You will have to 
name your supplements as &ldquo;supplement1.html&rdquo;, &ldquo;supplement2.html&rdquo;, etc.) 
You can find the sourcefile for the supplement template 
<a href="entries/sample/supplement.html">here</a> (use the View Source
function of your browser after following this link).</p>


<h3><a name="spe-cha">Using Special Characters</a></h3>

<p>
We allow the use of widely supported Unicode characters.  We have
drawn up a page of symbols, which we believe to be widely supported
among current web browsers, though many do not work with older
browsers and/or older operating systems (and this is noted at the top
of every entry in the SEP which uses one of these special
characters).  </p>

<p>
 So, if you need special punctuation characters, special accented Latin
characters, Greek characters, logic and/or mathematical symbols,
Polish characters, etc., please visit our page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <a href="symbols/entities.html">Widely Supported XHTML/HTML4 and Unicode Characters</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
 Note that you can use the formatting code that appears in either the
2nd or 3rd column of this table in your HTML source file. </p>
 
<p>
 There are various tricks one can use in HTML for formatting these
symbols in the complicated ways needed by logicians and
mathematicians.  For example, to get a web browser to display the word
&ldquo;G&ouml;del&rdquo; properly, note that you will find &ldquo;&ouml;&rdquo; (=
&ldquo;&amp;#246;&rdquo;) in the list of Latin Characters (in the section by that
name on the webpage listed above). It indicates that you can get the
browser to display the umlauted character by placing either the
character entity &ldquo;&amp;ouml;&rdquo; or &ldquo;&amp;#246;&rdquo; in your text.  Thus, to
produce the word &ldquo;G&ouml;del&rdquo;, you place the expression
&ldquo;G&amp;ouml;del&rdquo; or &ldquo;G&amp;#246;del&rdquo; in your HTML source file.</p>

<p>
We have set up table that shows you the HTML codes to
use for more sophisticated kinds of mathematical and logical 
formatting.  Please have a look at:</p>

<blockquote>
 <a href="symbols/math.html">Mathematics HTML Sampler</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
 As another example, note that the &ldquo;set membership&rdquo; relation &isin;,
the logical symbols &forall;, &exist;, and &equiv;, and the Greek
symbol &phi; can all found in the list of symbols on our page
 <a href="symbols/entities.html">Widely Supported XHTML/HTML4 and Unicode Characters</a>.  
 Now to produce the formatted line:</p>

  <blockquote>
 &exist;<em>x</em>&forall;<em>y</em>(<em>y</em>&isin;<em>x</em> 
 &equiv; <em>y</em>&isin;<em>A</em> &amp; &phi;) 
  </blockquote> 

<p>
 use the following sequence of HTML markup in your entry, where 
&lt;em&gt; &hellip; &lt;/em&gt; is the formatting environment for
italics:</p>

  <blockquote>
 &amp;exist;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&amp;forall;&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; &amp;equiv; 
 &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &amp;phi;)
  </blockquote>

<p>
 In some cases, however, the symbol you will need is not widely
supported in web browsers.  Therefore, if you do not find the symbol you need on our
page <a href="symbols/entities.html">Widely Supported XHTL/HTML4 and Unicode Characters</a>, 
 you can check our page:</p>

 <blockquote>
<a href="symbols/index-2.html">Special Symbols Not Widely Supported</a>
 </blockquote> 

<p>
 For example, we have produced the following graphics for the
&ldquo;dproves&rdquo; and the &ldquo;not-dproves&rdquo; signs, respectively:</p>

  <blockquote>
<img src="symbols/dproves.jpg" alt="dproves" /> <br />
<img src="symbols/not-dproves.jpg" alt="not dproves" />
  </blockquote> 

<p>
  These symbols can be found on the Special Symbols Not Widely
Supported page and you can download them onto your machine from there.
Follow the links to &ldquo;dproves.jpg&rdquo; and &ldquo;not-dproves.jpg&rdquo; in the table of
special symbols.  You can then save those graphics onto the drive of
your local computer.</p>

<p>
 If you are using an HTML-editor to create your entry, then you simply
use your software's &ldquo;add image&rdquo; (&ldquo;add graphic&rdquo;) function to place
these graphics on a line in your entry.  However, those authors who
are editing their HTML sourcefiles directly should use the following
guidelines.  To produce the formatted line:</p>

  <blockquote>
 <em>A</em>
 <img src="symbols/dproves.jpg" alt="dproves" />
 <em>B</em>
  </blockquote> 

<p>
 place the file &ldquo;dproves.jpg&rdquo; into the directory
containing your HTML entry and use the following HTML code in your
entry:</p>

  <blockquote>
  &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;img src="dproves.jpg" alt="dproves" /&gt; &lt;img src="dproves.jpg" alt="dproves" /&gt; 
  &lt;em&gt;B&lt;/em&gt;
  </blockquote>

<p>
 Note that you will not need to transfer the graphics to the same
directory on plato.stanford.edu when you transfer your entry to us &mdash;
the first time you view your file on our server after uploading it,
our software will recognize the links to our graphics and it will
automatically install copies of the needed graphic files into your
upload directory.</p>

<p>
 You may use any graphic found in our symbols page in this way.  If
you need a symbol not found on that page, write to the
editor&mdash;symbols are easily constructed.</p>

<h3><a name="for-rel">Formatting the Related Entries Section in HTML</a></h3>

<p>
 If you would like to create the links to related entries yourself,
then here is how you proceed. (This only works for published entries,
since you won't be able to discover the canonical directory (folder)
names for projected but unpublished entries.) Say you are writing an
entry on Frege and you wish to create a link to the entry on Davidson
in the Related Entries section.  The line in the HTML sourcefile
which does this will look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  &lt;a href="../davidson/"&gt;Davidson, Donald&lt;/a&gt;
</blockquote>

<p>
 The part of the code which creates the link is the bit:</p>

 <blockquote>
  &lt;a href="..."&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;
 </blockquote>

<p>
 You fill in the first ellipsis with the location of the file you want
to link to, and you fill in the second ellipsis with the label on the
link you want a web browser to display. In the example, the location
of the entry on Davidson is &ldquo;../davidson/&rdquo;.  (The string &ldquo;davidson&rdquo;
here is the canonical name of the directory containing the entry on
Davidson.)  This is server code which tells the browser to request the
default file in the directory &ldquo;davidson&rdquo; which appears in the
<em>parent</em> directory (&ldquo;../&rdquo;) of the current directory.  In our
example, since we are writing on Frege, we assume that the current
directory contains the entry on Frege and so if the browser goes to
the parent directory (which is the &ldquo;entries&rdquo; directory containing all
the entries) and then down to the &ldquo;davidson&rdquo; directory, it will find
the default file.</p>

<p>
 Now you can find out the canonical name of the directory
containing the entry on Davidson by visiting the entry on Davidson in
the <i>Encyclopedia</i>.  When you reach it, you will see that the URL
is:</p>

<blockquote>
 https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/davidson/
</blockquote>

<p>
 The last field of this string is &ldquo;davidson&rdquo;, and that is the canonical
name of the directory containing the entry on Davidson.</p>

<h3><a name="for-foot">Formatting Footnotes in HTML</a></h3>

<p>SEP entries are formatted so that the footnotes are placed into a
separate HTML file called &ldquo;notes.html&rdquo; and linked into the text. The
file notes.html is placed into the same directory on
plato.stanford.edu as the entry.  If you are using an HTML-editor to
create your entry, then you will need to use the functions provided by
the editing software in order to create footnotes as links to a footnote
file. </p>

<p>
However, for those authors who are editing their HTML 
directly in order to create links from the text to the footnotes,
here are some guidelines to follow.  Suppose you want to add footnote
number <em>x</em> at a point in the text:</p>

<blockquote>
...some text.<sup>[<a href="#note-x" id="ref-x">x</a>]</sup>
</blockquote>

<p>
To produce this in your HTML sourcefile, use the following HTML
code at the point in the text where the footnote should occur: </p>

<blockquote>
  ...some text.&lt;sup&gt;[&lt;a href="notes.html#note-x" id="ref-x"&gt;x&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;
</blockquote>

<p>
 This will place &ldquo;[x]&rdquo; as a superscript in the text, with &ldquo;x&rdquo; a
link to the place in the notes.html file identified as id="note-x" (see
below).  The id="ref-x" marks the spot in the current file to which
a &ldquo;Return&rdquo; link from the notes.html file will return (again, see
below).  Then, create another HTML file named &ldquo;notes.html&rdquo; and in that
file you will try to produce something that looks like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<a href="#ref-x">x.</a> Body of the footnote goes here.&hellip;
</blockquote>

 <p>
To produce this line in the notes.html file, you would add the
following HTML code:</p>

<blockquote>
   &lt;div id="note-x"><br />
   &lt;p&gt; <br />
   &lt;a href="index.html#ref-x"&gt;x.&lt;/a&gt; Body of
the footnote goes here.&hellip;&lt;/p&gt;<br />

   &lt;/div&gt;
</blockquote>

<p> 
 This will start a new paragraph and start the footnote with the symbol
&ldquo;x.&rdquo; (&ldquo;x.&rdquo; will be a link back to id="note-x" in the main
index.html file; the id="note-x" identifies the place in the notes.html
file to which the footnote in the main text will be linked).  Note:
Users of the <em>Encyclopedia</em> can always use the &ldquo;Back&rdquo; or &ldquo;Return&rdquo;
button on their browsers to get back to the text.</p>

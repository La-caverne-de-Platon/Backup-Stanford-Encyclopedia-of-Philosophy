<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">The Neuroscience of Consciousness</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

 If one had to pick a rubric for the type of neuroscience discussed
here, it would be <em>cognitive neuroscience</em>, a label that both
psychologists and neuroscientists gravitate towards and which refers
to the task of identifying the neural basis of states that have some
connection to <em>cognition</em> broadly construed, with much recent
focus on perception, decision making, and memory.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

 The relevant notion of information in neuroscience is a statistical
notion about reducing uncertainty regarding a random variable. It is
not a notion of semantic content. See the entry on 
 <a href="../perception-contents/index.html">the contents of perception</a>.
For an accessible deployment of
similar notions of information in philosophy of mind as a basis for
semantic content, see Dretske 1981.</p>
</div>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 While some neuroscientists intend &ldquo;neural representation&rdquo;
in a semantical sense (deCharms &amp; Zador 2000), often, they mean
<em>information</em> in a statistical sense (e.g., Claude
Shannon&rsquo;s notion of <em>mutual information</em> [Shannon 1949]):
information is quantified as the amount of uncertainty reduced by a
signal concerning a random variable. In this context, one often speaks
of a neuron carrying information <em>about</em> <i>X</i>, but
&ldquo;about&rdquo; does not signal a semantic value but a way of
noting the reduction of uncertainty with respect to <i>X</i>. This
entry will ignore this statistical reading in favor, provisionally, of
a more robust, semantical, notion of representation that allows for
accuracy and inaccuracy. See the entries on
 <a href="../information/index.html">information</a>
 and
 <a href="../mental-representation/index.html">mental representation</a>.
 The topic of neural representation is surprisingly underdiscussed
(but see Shea forthcoming).</p>

 Evans wrote:</p>

<blockquote>[A] subject can gain knowledge of his internal
informational states [his &lsquo;perceptual experiences&rsquo;] in a
very simple way: by re-using precisely those skills of
conceptualization that he uses to make judgements about the world.
Here is how he can do it. He goes through exactly the same procedure
as he would go through if he were trying to make a judgement about how
it is at this place now &hellip; he may prefix this result with the
operator &lsquo;It seems to me as though&hellip;&rsquo;. (Evans 1982:
227&ndash;28).</blockquote>

 The issues become even more complicated depending on what form of
attention we are focusing on (see Chapter 5 of Wu 2014b for detailed
discussion). For a theorist who takes attention to be necessary and
sufficient for consciousness, see Prinz 2012.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Experimental work attempting to dissociate attention from
consciousness often fail to be sufficiently specific as to what
attention is. For example, some recent work attempts to show
consciousness in the &ldquo;near absence&rdquo; of attention (Li et
al. 2002). This work, while interesting, would not address the central
issue of the necessity of attention for consciousness (for discussion,
see Wu 2014b: chap. 5).</p>

 Colin Klein (2017) has argued that vegetative state patients lack a
capacity to form intentions. It seems plausible that their normal
capacities for forming intentions are defective. It is less clear
whether their responses to commands would fail to count as an
intentional action, whether this involves acquiring an intention due
to &ldquo;exogenous&rdquo; stimuli (the command) or whether
intentional action does not require an intention (it could be a
simpler, action-oriented state). There are also broader issues about
&ldquo;levels of consciousness&rdquo; that we shall not address
here.</p>

science, with focus on IIT, see Hakwan Lau&rsquo;s blog entry (Lau

 To motivate IIT, Tononi (2004) contrasts systems that can carry large
amounts of information but are not conscious with those that are. For
example, he contrasts a large array of photo diodes to the human
visual system. Both systems can convey a large amount of information,
but only one is conscious. As he notes, a crucial difference between
the two systems is that in the human visual system, information is
integrated via connections between visual neurons while the photo
array, with its disconnected diodes, lacks the capacity to integrate
information. Still, this contrast suggests only a necessary condition
for consciousness, namely that the absence of integration disrupts
what is needed for consciousness. It is not clear that the case
motivates a sufficiency claim. It is also not clear that it provides
an informative necessary condition (e.g., breathing is an
uninformative necessary condition for human consciousness). Second,
why should this thought experiment motivate IIT over other theories?
While it might be true that the photo array lacks integration, it also
lacks many other capacities present in a human system.</p>

<p>
Tononi (2008) also motivates IIT by appeal to &ldquo;axioms&rdquo;
about consciousness that are taken to be self-evident. This raises
earlier concerns about an introspective channel that can reliably
deliver such truths
 (<a href="index-2.html#IntrRepo">section 2.1</a>).
 The key axiom that Tononi adduces is <em>integration</em>:
consciousness is unified [in that] each experience is irreducible to
noninterdependent subsets of phenomenal distinctions. So, the Italian
verb &ldquo;<em>sono</em>&rdquo; is not the conjunction of separable
experiences of &ldquo;so&rdquo; and of &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Thus, rather
than thinking of the axiom of integration as <em>entailing</em>
information integration (\(&Phi; &gt;0\)), we can see IIT as something
like a best explanation of the axiom (for criticisms of IIT&rsquo;s
axiomatic approach, see Bayne 2018). Taken this way, the challenge
will be to test this specific claim, to show that concrete cases of
conscious integration are best explained by informational integration.
The question remains whether we have reason to endorse IIT over other
theories.</p>

 Another important set of experiments taken to support the
ventral-conscious/dorsal unconscious dichotomy concerns work that
provides evidence for the seemingly different effects of visual
illusions on each stream, with the ventral stream being subject to
them yet the dorsal stream impervious to them as evidenced by report
and by action respectively. Subjects report seeing an illusory
stimulus as being a certain way when it is not, yet motor action
towards the stimulus does not show itself to be subject to the
illusion. For important early work on this, see Aglioti, DeSouza,
&amp; Goodale 1995; Haffenden &amp; Goodale 1998; Haffenden, Schiff,
&amp; Goodale 2001 and for criticism, see Smeets &amp; Brenner 2006;
Franz &amp; Gegenfurtner 2008; Franz 2001. For an argument from these
results to &ldquo;zombie&rdquo; action in normal individuals, see Wu
2013.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Campion et al. (1983) raised alternative explanations of the data,
one to be discussed in the text. The others were: (1) perhaps
information reaches spared residual cortex in V1 or (2) vision informs
behavior due to light scattering from the stimulus onto a part of the
retina corresponding to spared V1. Not every blindsight patient has
been tested to rule out these alternatives though in the case of the
well-studied patient GY, imaging suggests that no cortex is spared in
his V1 lesion. Light scattering mediated behaviors has been
demonstrated in some blindsight patients (King et al. 1996) though the
effect cannot explain all blindsight cases. For example, in a clever
control, a stimulus that elicits blindsight behavior fails to do so
when projected to the blindspot (e.g., Stoerig, H&uuml;bner, &amp;
P&ouml;ppel 1985). It seems plausible that there exist cases where (1)
and (2) are not true.</p>

 Binocular rivalry might seem visually idiosyncratic, a product of
special laboratory conditions, but it might be common. Consider
looking at the distance when there is an occluding tree in one&rsquo;s
right visual field blocking the right eye more than the left. There is
a substantial difference in the images of each eye, and rivalry might
obtain in such natural viewing conditions (Arnold 2011a,b;
O&rsquo;Shea 2011).</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Consider Fetsch et al.&rsquo;s (2014) recent attempt to have monkeys
report their <em>confidence</em> about their perception (confidence is
not obviously a phenomenal property, but the point here is to get the
animals to turn their attention &ldquo;inward&rdquo;). Using a
paradigm where direction of apparent motion (here, left or right) is
reported by an eye movement, the researchers also provided animals
with a &ldquo;sure bet&rdquo; choice in some trials, a third target to
which the animal could move its eye. Where animals are
<em>uncertain</em> of the stimuli&rsquo;s motion, they can opt out by
taking the sure (smaller) reward. The authors conclude that when
animals were confident, they tended to make reports and reject the
sure bet; when not confident, they opted for the sure bet. The
researchers also microstimulated on some trials and observed a shift
in the psychometric function, one they interpreted as a
microstimulation based increase in confidence.</p>

<p>
Does the animal in fact turn attention inward, assessing their
confidence? One challenge is the meaning of the sure bet stimulus.
When the animal moves its eyes to it, what exactly is it reporting?
The authors suggest that the animal indicates lower confidence but
given that &ldquo;the monkey accepted the sure bet most often for the
stimulus conditions that led to the most <em>equivocal</em> choice
proportions&rdquo; (p. 798, my emphasis), the monkey might in fact be
reporting that the stimulus was <em>neither left nor right</em>. That
is, the report remains externally directed, a claim about the stimulus
category and not about confidence. The report can thus indicate
uncertainty without being a report of it.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Interestingly, microstimulation had to be generated at a certain
intensity to be detected: (a) at low amplitudes (&lt;40 mA)), animals
did not detect the microstimulation and appeared to wait for onset of
the test stimulus as if they had not noticed anything; (b) at moderate
amplitudes (40-65 mA), the animals could detect a stimulation so
attempted the task, but their performance fell to chance levels; (c)
at higher amplitudes (&gt;65 mA), animals were able to discriminate as
well as when the stimulation was mechanical. Clearly mere stimulation
is not sufficient to trigger behavior, and action is engaged only when
stronger stimulation is applied.</p>

gustatory guided behavior in rodents (Peng et al. 2015)</p>

 We set aside issues of distributed representations. The simple code
noted here is a version of the <em>grandmother cell</em> hypothesis
which maps one-to-one semantic value to neuron. A different view takes
representation to be <em>distributed</em> rather than local. Our
question is not about the vehicle but about the content of the
representation.</p>

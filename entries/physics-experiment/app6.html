<h2>Appendix 6: Sometimes Refutation Doesn't Work: The Double-Scattering of Electrons</h2>

<p>

In 1929, Mott (1929, and later 1931, 1932) calculated, on the basis
of Dirac&rsquo;s theory of the electron, that there would be a
forward-backward asymmetry of approximately 10% in the double
scattering of electrons from heavy nuclei. Mott clearly specified the
conditions that would have to be satisfied in order to observe this
effect. One had to double scatter relativistic electrons at large
angles (90&deg;) from heavy nuclei (most calculations assumed a
nuclear charge \(Z\) approximately 80). The first scatter would polarize
the electrons and the second scatter would analyze the produced
polarization, giving rise to an asymmetry.</p>

<p>

The earliest experiment that discussed Mott&rsquo;s calculation was
performed by Chase (1929). He observed a 4% asymmetry in the double
scattering of electrons but attributed it to a difference in the path
that the electrons followed. His subsequent experiment (Chase 1930)
reported a 1.5% effect, and this time did attribute it to Mott
scattering. Most experiments during the early 1930s, showed no
polarization effects, although some of them did not satisfy the
conditions for Mott scattering (For details see Franklin (1986, Ch.
2)). The sole positive results were provided by experiments done by
Rupp (1929; 1930a; 1930b; 1931; 1932a; 1932b; 1932c). Rupp&rsquo;s 1932
experiment first scattered electrons at 90&deg; from a gold
foil, followed by a 90&deg; scatter from a gold wire. He found a
3&ndash;4% asymmetry at an electron energy of 130 keV and an asymmetry of
9&ndash;10% at 250 keV. These results , although positive, were in
quantitative disagreement with Mott&rsquo;s prediction of 15.5% at 127 keV
and 14% at 204 keV (Mott 1931). Dymond (1931) also reported a positive
result, but one that was five times smaller than the theoretical
prediction.</p>

<p>

Mott and the rest of the electron-scattering community were quite
aware of both the confused nature of the experimental results, and of
the apparent discrepancy between experiment and theory. Langstroth
(1932) reviewed the situation and commented on the difficulty of
experiment-theory comparison when one deals with real, as opposed to
ideal, experiments. &ldquo;In view of the fact that practical conditions may
be immensely more complicated than those of Mott&rsquo;s theory, it is not
surprising that it does not furnish a guide, even in a qualitative way,
to all of the above experiments. This may be due to (a) the fact that a
large proportion of the beam scattered from a thick target consists of
electrons which have undergone more than one collision, (b) the
insufficiency of the theoretical model, (c) the inclusion of extraneous
effects in the experimental results&rdquo; (pp. 566&ndash;67).</p>

<p>

The situation became even more confused when Dymond(1932) published
a detailed account of his experiment, which restated his positive, but
discrepant, result. Adding to the confusion was the fact Dymond&rsquo;s
experiment seemed to satisfy all the conditions for Mott scattering.
Rupp (1934) continued his work, this time using thallium vapor rather
than gold targets, and again found a positive result. G.P. Thomson
(1933), on the other hand, found no effect. At approximately the same
time Sauter (1933) redid Mott&rsquo;s calculations and obtained identical
results. He also considered whether or not screening by atomic
electrons could cancel the predicted effect and found that it could
not. If things weren&rsquo;t difficult enough, they got worse when Dymond
(1934) published a full repudiation of his earlier results. He had
found a considerable and variable experimental asymmetry in his
apparatus, and concluded that he had not, in fact, observed any
polarization effect. Dymond also considered possible reasons for the
theory-experiment discrepancy including inelastic, stray, and plural
scattering, and nuclear screening and rejected them all. He concluded,
&ldquo;We are driven to the conclusion that the theoretical results are
wrong. There is no reason to believe that the work of Mott is
incorrect;&hellip; It seems not improbable, therefore, that the divergence
of theory from experiment has a more deep-seated cause, and that the
Dirac wave equation needs modification in order to account successfully
for the absence of polarization&rdquo; (Dymond 1932, p. 666).</p>

<p>

G.P. Thomson (1934) also published a comprehensive review of the
field. He reported no effects of the type found by Rupp and he found a
forward-backward ratio of \((0.996\pm 0.01)\) in comparison to Mott&rsquo;s
prediction of 1.15.Thomson also concluded that there was a serious
discrepancy between theory and experiment.</p>

<p>

Faced with this apparent theory-experiment discrepancy, theorists
sought either to modify Dirac&rsquo;s theory or to propose a new theory, and
thus accommodate the experimental results. Hellmann (1935), Halpern and
Schwinger (1935), and Winter (1936) offered modifications of the
Coulomb potential, each of which had the effect that it &ldquo;annihilates
the polarization effect completely.&rdquo; Although each of the theoretical
calculations predicted null results from double scattering experiments,
they were not regarded as solving the problem. One might speculate that
this was because these modifications had no physical or theoretical
underpinning. They seemed invented solely for the purpose of explaining
the experimental results.</p>

<p>

Experimental work also continued. The situation became even more
confused when Rupp (1935) withdrew several of his results on electron
scattering This eliminated the most positive results supporting Mott&rsquo;s
 theory.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A6-1" name="note-A6-1">1</a>]</sup>
 In 1937 Richter
published what he regarded as the definitive experiment on the double
scattering of electrons. He claimed to have satisfied the conditions of
Mott&rsquo;s calculation exactly and had found no effect. He concluded that
&ldquo;Despite all the favorable conditions of the experiment, however, no
sign of the Mott effect could be observed. <em>With this experimental
finding, Mott&rsquo;s theory of the double scattering of electrons from the
atomic nucleus can no longer be maintained.</em> It cannot be decided
here how much Dirac&rsquo;s theory of electron spin, which is at the basis of
Mott&rsquo;s theory, and its other applications are implicated through the
denial of Mott&rsquo;s theory&rdquo; (Richter 1937, p. 554). The discrepancy was
further confirmed by the theoretical work of Rose and Bethe (1939).
They examined various ways of trying to eliminate the discrepancy and
concluded that &ldquo;the discrepancy between theory and experiment 
remains&mdash;perhaps more glaring than before&rdquo; (p. 278).</p>

<p>

Thus, at the end of 1939 there was a clear discrepancy between Dirac
theory, as used by Mott, and the experimental results on the double
scattering of electrons. Yet the theory was not regarded as refuted.
Why was this? The reason is that, at the time, Dirac theory, and only
Dirac theory, predicted the existence of the positron (a positive
electron). This particle had been discovered in 1932 and had provided
very strong support for Dirac theory. In comparison with this success,
the discrepancy in electron scattering, along with another small
discrepancy in the spectrum of hydrogen, just did not have sufficient
evidential weight. The unique, and confirmed, prediction of the
positron outweighed these discrepancies. It isn&rsquo;t easy to refute a
strongly confirmed theory. Neither is it impossible as demonstrated by
the histories of both parity nonconservation and CP violation discussed
earlier.</p>

<p>

Interestingly, it was the experimental results that were wrong. In
the early 1940s experimental work showed that the way in which the
experiments were performed during the 1930s had precluded the
possibility of observing the polarization effects predicted by Mott. In
order to avoid problems with multiple scattering the experimenters had
scattered the electrons from the front surface of the targets.
Unfortunately this made the effects of plural scattering, a few large
scatters rather than just one as required by Mott, very large. The
symmetric plural scattering swamped the predicted polarization effect.
When the experimental apparatuses were changed to eliminate this
problem the discrepancy
 disappeared.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A6-2" name="note-A6-2">2</a>]</sup>
 Mott&rsquo;s theory was then supported by
the experimental evidence.</p>

<p>

We have seen here a classic case of the Duhem-Quine problem and how
the physics community attempted to solve it. There was a clear
discrepancy between the experimental results and the predictions of a
well-confirmed theory. The experiments were redone to check the
results, with careful attention to the experimental conditions required
by the theory. Theorists checked on whether or not other effects might
mask the predicted polarization effect. Other theorists offered
competing explanations. Ultimately a solution was found.</p>

<p>

Does the fact that Dirac theory was not regarded as refuted even
though experiment clearly disagreed with its predictions mean that
physicists disregard negative results whenever it suits their purposes?
Do physicists really tune in on existing community commitments, as some
social constructivists would have it, and overlook negative evidence?
The answer is no. There is no indication in this episode that the
negative evidence was disregarded. The physics community examined the
theory in the light of all the available experimental evidence, weighed
its importance, and then made a decision. I note that even though Dirac
theory remained relatively unscathed, both experimental and theoretical
work continued until the problem was solved. The discrepancy was not
hidden from view, nor was it ignored.</p>

 Our set of three propositions is thus inconsistent in the same sense
that contraries are inconsistent. Even though it is possible that all
three propositions are false, it is not possible that all three of
them should be true.</p>

 Precisely because our loving mother in this example loves both of her
squabbling children equally, she will likewise try to resolve their
squabble as equitably as possible, or try to compensate in some way
the one who loses out, or perhaps even take away the toy from both of
them in order to teach a valuable lesson. In the case of beloved
children whom we love equally, we often appeal to some notion of
fairness or non-retributive justice when we find ourselves unable to
satisfy all of their incompatible interests.</p>

 For the sake of accuracy, the word &ldquo;not&rdquo; in Albert C.
Outler&rsquo;s translation has been repositioned. The original
translation reads as follows: &ldquo;not even if a single member of
the race were saved from it, no one could rail against God&rsquo;s
justice.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

 Some in the Augustinian tradition have allowed that God might in fact
save all who die in infancy&mdash;not, however, because they are
innocent or deserve something from God and certainly not because God
owes it to them to do something on their behalf. To the contrary,
dying in infancy, no less than someone&rsquo;s performing good works,
is merely an indication, according to these Augustinian theologians,
that someone is to be numbered among the elect. Accordingly, God
<em>could justly have condemned</em> those who die in infancy, so they
claim, even if, fortunately for them, God in fact chooses not to do
so.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

 Popular arguments over the issue of capital punishment illustrate the
point nicely. Opponents of capital punishment often point out, quite
rightly, that the execution of a murderer does nothing to bring the
victim of murder back to life and, in that sense, does nothing to
restore a just order. On the other side, a proponent of capital
punishment might retort that society should not permit murderers to
gain an unfair advantage over their victims through an act of murder;
so even though we humans have no power to achieve perfect justice in
this matter, we can at least prevent this additional injustice and, in
addition, even the score a bit. But whatever position one takes on
this issue, it seems obvious that we humans have no power to achieve
perfect justice in a case of murder, because neither the murderer nor
society at large has the power to resurrect the victim of murder or to
repair all of the harm that a murder brings into the lives of
people.</p>
</div>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Interesting enough, Augustine&rsquo;s understanding of justice and
mercy, as we encounter it in his later writings, appears flatly to
contradict his earlier commitment to the philosophical doctrine of
divine simplicity: the difficult to understand idea that each
attribute of God is identical not only with God, but with every other
attribute of God as well. For if those in hell are the object of
God&rsquo;s justice but not of God&rsquo;s mercy, then justice and
mercy are distinct and very different attributes of God.</p>

 An important clarification is perhaps in order at this point. For not
all who have traditionally identified themselves as Arminians are
fully committed to the idea that God&rsquo;s love is both
unconditional in its character and unlimited in its scope. Unlike
Roman Catholics, whose understanding of purgatory provides them with a
good deal more flexibility on the point, many of these traditional
Arminians hold that, for unrepentant sinners anyway, God&rsquo;s love
has a built in time limit, namely, the moment of a person&rsquo;s
physical death; they therefore reject the idea that God will continue
striving to save sinners after this deadline has passed. Some
traditional Arminians are therefore no more committed than the
Augustinians are to God&rsquo;s inexhaustible love for <em>all</em>
sinners. They insist instead, even as Jonathan Edwards did, that any
sinners who fail to repent before they die will discover that
God&rsquo;s <em>conditional</em> and <em>limited</em> love has
instantaneously turned to wrath and to <em>hatred without love</em>.
Such a view at least clarifies why the damned never repent and never
vacate hell; they simply have no choice in the matter. Once God
rejects them with finality, they will never again have any opportunity
to repent. So in that respect, at least, these traditional Arminians
no more regard hell as a freely embraced condition than the
Augustinians do. More recently, however, a number of those working
within a basically Arminian framework&mdash;call them free-will
theists&mdash;have tried to formulate a more consistent free-will
theodicy of hell, and their work also reflects a more consistent
commitment to God&rsquo;s inexhaustible love for all created
persons.</p>

 It sometimes comes as a surprise to Christians that the term
&ldquo;final judgment&rdquo; never appears anywhere in the New
Testament; that is, no Greek word properly translated into English as
&ldquo;final judgment&rdquo; ever appears there. But Buckareff and
Plug also appear to be at cross-purposes with themselves when they
concede the following in a footnote: &ldquo;it is possible that an
agent&rsquo;s character may become settled [irrevocably so?] after a
while. If so, the agent may find it psychologically impossible
properly to respond to God&rsquo;s prevenient grace&rdquo; (54, n.21).
As Benjamin Matheson points out, however, &ldquo;this seems
problematic for escapism&rdquo; because the whole point of a genuine
open door policy with respect to those in hell rests &ldquo;on the
claim that it is psychologically possible for persons in Hell to
leave&rdquo; (Matheson 2014, 204). If taken seriously, then, the
Buckareff and Plug concession in their footnote appears to collapse
their own view back into the view that Walls, Swinburne, and Manis
have defended. We can nonetheless maintain the distinctiveness of our
second answer simply by maintaining that, according to it, those in
hell never lose forever the ability to continue sinning freely and
hence never lose forever the ability to repent freely either. For an
excellent statement of this view, see VanArragon 2010,
41&ndash;42.</p>
</div>

 One is, of course, free to stipulate in a given context any meaning
for the term &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; that one pleases, so long as one
continues to use it consistently in that context. Accordingly, one
might proceed in either of two different ways at this point. One
could, as recommended here, make a minimal degree of rationality an
additional necessary condition of the relevant <em>freedom</em>. Or,
one could, alternatively, identify freedom with some formulation of
PAP, as Kvanvig seems to recommend, and concede that our schizophrenic
young man is not morally responsible for all of his free choices and
actions.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Some will no doubt find counterintuitive the idea that our immoral
choices are sometimes more helpful than our morally proper choices are
in producing a virtuous character. For libertarians often adopt, as a
kind of unexamined metaphysical assumption, a picture similar to what
Robert Kane sketches in the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>
The probabilities for strong- or weak-willed behavior are often the
results of agents&rsquo; own past choices and actions, as Aristotle
and other thinkers have insisted. Agents can be responsible for
building their moral characters over time by their (moral or
prudential) choices or actions, and the character building will be
reflected by changes in the probabilities for strong- or weak-willed
behavior in future situations. Each time the [alcoholic] engineer
resists taking a drink in difficult circumstances, he may strengthen
his will to resist in the future; and conversely, when he succumbs,
his will to resist may lessen (or crumble altogether, as sometimes
happens with alcoholics) (Kane 1998, 180).
</blockquote>

<p>
Even though such a picture reflects accurately <em>some</em> of our
experience in <em>some</em> contexts, there is surely another side to
this particular story. Kane is right, of course, about this: one
biochemical effect of alcohol on the brain, at least in the case of
alcoholics, seems to be that it undermines the will to resist another
drink. But alcoholism also illustrates how the desperation connected
with plunging to the depths can also inspire someone to seek help,
perhaps by joining Alcoholics Anonymous or in some other way.
Alcoholics sometimes report, moreover, that the longer they resist
temptation and keep making the right choice, the easier it is during
times of stress to deceive themselves into believing that this time a
couple of drinks will do no harm; and. alternatively, the more often
they binge terribly and experience the destructive consequences of
doing so, the easier it is to resist temptation in the future. So in
that respect, their experience is just the opposite of what Kane has
described.</p>

<p>
Similarly, if there is such a thing as divine grace, then the
destructive consequences of our worst choices may be the very thing
that ultimately persuades us to seek whatever divine help might be
available.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 When Paul quoted the poet Epimenides of Crete in order to make the
point that &ldquo;in him [God] we live and move and have our
being&rdquo; (Acts 17:28), one might interpret this to imply that God
is not only our moral and spiritual environment, but our physical
environment as well. Given that interpretation, even our experience of
the physical order would be an implicit experience of God.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

 Whereas modus ponens is an argument of the form: <em>if <i>p</i> then
<i>q</i>; <i>p</i>; therefore <i>q</i></em>, modus tollens is an
argument of the form: <em>if <i>p</i> then <i>q</i>; not <i>q</i>;
therefore not <i>p</i></em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Although many Christians (Wesleyans, Catholics, and other Protestant
Arminians) typically find Edwards&rsquo; view here nothing less than
appalling, it is not without its contemporary defenders. Michael J.
Hart thus writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; by God&rsquo;s displaying eternal punishment the elect would
become more grateful of their place in heaven. &hellip; The picture is
this: I was just like so-and-so, yet I am exalted and they are
debased, and the fact that they were just like me makes me happier
than I would otherwise be at my exaltation. But why is this? One
answer concerns likelihood: it is because the closer I was to them in
nature and circumstances, the more likely it would be that I end up
like them. So when I discover that my fate has been radically
different and better than theirs, my joy over my fate enjoys greater
intensity. &hellip; [Accordingly, by] reprobating a greater number to
hell, the elect in heaven are permitted a great gratitude not
otherwise available to them: a gratitude at being part of the few that
are saved (Hart 2016, 258&ndash;259).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like Jonathan Edwards, Hart is also a theological determinist and thus
holds that God intended from the beginning to reprobate the non-elect
and to bring each of them to a horrific end. Accordingly, a proponent
of such a view must either deny that the elect have loved ones in
hell, or deny that genuine love ties the interests of people together
in the way described in section 4.1, or deny that God loves deeply
even the elect in heaven. Those who believe that God&rsquo;s deepest
possible love extends equally to each member of the human race will
also wonder how gratitude of the kind described in the above quotation
is supposed to differ from human selfishness of a kind utterly
inconsistent with genuine love.</p>

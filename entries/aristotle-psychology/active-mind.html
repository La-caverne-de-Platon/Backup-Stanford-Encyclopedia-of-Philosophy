<h2>The Active Mind of <em>De Anima</em> iii 5</h2>

<p>
After characterizing the mind (<em>nous</em>) and its activities in
<em>De Anima</em> iii 4, Aristotle takes a surprising turn. In
<em>De Anima</em> iii 5, he introduces an obscure and hotly disputed
subject: the <em>active mind</em> or <em>active intellect</em>
(<em>nous poi&ecirc;tikos</em>). Controversy surrounds almost
every aspect of <em>De Anima</em> iii 5, not least because in it
Aristotle characterizes the active mind&mdash;a topic mentioned nowhere
else in his entire corpus&mdash;as &lsquo;separate and unaffected and
unmixed, being in its essence actuality&rsquo; (<em>ch&ocirc;ristos kai
apath&ecirc;s kai amig&ecirc;s, t&ecirc;(i) ousia(i) energeia</em>;
<em>DA</em> iii 5, 430a17&ndash;18) and then also as &lsquo;deathless and
everlasting&rsquo; (<em>athanaton kai aidion</em>; <em>DA</em> iii 5,
430a23). This comes as no small surprise to readers of <em>De
Anima</em>, because Aristotle had earlier in the same work treated the
mind (<em>nous</em>) as but one faculty (<em>dunamis</em>) of the soul
(<em>psuch&ecirc;</em>), and he had contended that the soul as a whole
is <em>not</em> separable from the body (<em>DA</em> ii 1,
413a3&ndash;5).</p>

<p>
While not strictly a contradiction, this constellation of views does
present a serious interpretative difficulty. How could the active
mind be separable if it is a capacity of the soul and the soul is not
separable? How, indeed, might a capacity be separated from that
of which it is a capacity? Typically we expect capacities to be
grounded and not free-floating. In what precise sense, then, is
the active mind separable, conceptually or ontologically? For
that matter, from what precisely is the active mind held to be
separable&mdash;the body, the other faculties of the soul, or some
unspecified category of being? What, exactly, <em>is</em> the
active mind (<em>nous</em> <em>poi&ecirc;tikos</em>) and how is it
related to the unqualified mind (<em>nous</em>) discussed in the
previous chapter? Should we, in fact, even regard the active mind
as a capacity of the human soul, or is that merely an assumption of
some of Aristotle&rsquo;s readers? If it is indeed a capacity of
the human soul, does this imply that Aristotle envisages some form of
personal immortality for human beings, perhaps something akin to the
view espoused by Plato in the <em>Phaedo</em>?</p>

<p>
These and like questions have exercised the commentary tradition from
antiquity down to the present
 day.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
When addressing them, Aristotle&rsquo;s
interpreters scatter in strikingly different exegetical
directions. So varied are their approaches, in fact, that it is
tempting to regard <em>De Anima</em> iii 5 as a sort of Rorschach Test
for Aristotelians: it is hard to avoid the conclusion that readers
discover in this chapter the Aristotle they hope to admire.
Christian exegetes tend to see it as a vindication of the compatibility
of personal immortality and soul-body
 hylomorphism;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
other readers, thinking that a
non-starter, regard the chapter as an abrupt change of topic in the midst
of <em>De Anima</em>, by contending that in it Aristotle has left off
talking about human beings and has turned his attention instead
to the impersonal, self-thinking god of <em>Metaphysics</em>
 xii.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
The first and
most consequential fault line, then, concerns whether <em>De Anima</em>
iii 5 should be taken as characterizing the human mind or the divine
mind.</p>

<p>
Those who read <em>De Anima</em> iii 5 as pertaining to the human soul
are quick to point out that even as Aristotle introduced the
inseparability of the soul earlier in the work, in <em>De Anima</em> ii
1, he held out mind (<em>nous</em>) as at least possibly exceptional:
&lsquo;nothing hinders some parts [of the soul] from being separable,
because of their not being the actualities of any body&rsquo;
(<em>DA</em> ii 1, 413a3&ndash;7; cf. i 1, 403a3&ndash;b19, ii 2, 413b24&ndash;7, iii 4,
429a10&ndash;13, b5&ndash;5). This exception, they further note, is
continuous with a similar remark made in the
<em>Metaphysics</em>: &lsquo;We must inquire whether any [form]
survives afterward. For in some cases nothing prevents this, for
example if the soul is of this sort&mdash;not all soul but mind
(<em>nous</em>), for perhaps it is impossible for the entire soul to
survive&rsquo; (<em>Met</em>. xii 3, 1070a24&ndash;6).
Those of the second persuasion, who think that Aristotle must be
talking about the divine mind, are not impressed. They note in
reply that in <em>De Anima</em> iii 5 Aristotle uses the sort of
language he tends to reserve for the unmoved mover of the
<em>Metaphysics</em> xii and <em>Physics</em> viii, and further that
<em>De Anima</em> is best regarded as a work of biology with a focus on
ensouled material beings, including plants no less than human and
non-human animals. As such, it is a work whose general
orientation leaves scant space for such extravagant, essentially
Platonic hypotheses.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, it is not possible to settle even this basic controversy
with confidence. To begin, given the extensive ambiguities of the
language of the chapter, neither approach can be ruled out on narrowly
textual grounds. Moreover, the several illustrations and
analogies in the chapter all admit of multiple interpretations, while
the argumentative structure of the chapter, upon which one might rely
to force one interpretation over another, is regrettably thin.
Consequently, <em>De Anima</em> iii 5 is permanently contestable in
terms of its final commitments.</p>

<p>
The chapter in its entirety runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p> Since in all of nature something is the matter for
each genus (and this is all those things in potentiality), while
something else is their cause and is productive
(<em>poi&ecirc;tikon</em>), by producing them all as a craft does in
relation to the matter it has fashioned, necessarily these same
differentiations are present in the soul.  And one sort of mind exists
by coming to be all things and one sort of mind exists by producing
all things, as a kind of positive state, like light. For in a certain
way, light makes colors existing in potentiality colors in
actuality.</p>

<p>
And this mind is separate and unaffected and unmixed, being in its
essence actuality. For what produces is always superior to what
is affected, as too the first principle is to the matter.</p>

<p>
[Actual knowledge is the same as the thing known, though in an
individual potential knowledge is prior in time, though it is not prior
in time
 generally.]<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
But it is not the case that sometimes it thinks and sometimes it does
not. And having been separated, this alone is just as it is, and
this alone is deathless and everlasting, though we do not remember,
because this is unaffected, whereas passive mind is perishable.
And without this, nothing thinks.</p></blockquote>

<p>

The translation offered represents something of the compression and
obscurity of Aristotle&rsquo;s Greek. Very little is clear about
the chapter, and nothing is uncontroversial.</p>

<p>
To give some sense of the complexities involved in interpreting these
few lines: Brentano&rsquo;s commentary runs to some seventy pages, a
ratio of almost five pages to each one line of Greek (Brentano
1977). As one Aristotelian commentator has fairly noted, &lsquo;There
is no passage of ancient philosophy that has provoked such a multitude
of interpretations as this half-page chapter. Its obscurity and
extreme brevity are notorious&rsquo; (Theiler 1983, 142).</p>

<p>
That allowed, most scholars will accept at least the following
characterizations of <em>De Anima</em> iii 5, even as they differ about
their proper interpretations:</p>

<ul>

<li>Aristotle introduces a division into mind (<em>nous</em>) which he
maintains is present generally in nature, between the active and the
passive (<em>DA</em> 430a10&ndash;14).</li>

<li>The
active mind is compared to a craft, while the passive mind is likened
to matter (<em>DA</em> 430a12&ndash;13).</li>

<li>The 
active mind is compared to light, which in a certain way makes colours
that exist in potentiality exist in actuality (<em>DA</em>
430a16&ndash;17).</li>

<li>Having been separated, the active mind alone is deathless and
everlasting (<em>DA</em> 430a23&ndash;24).</li>

<li>Passive mind, by contrast, is perishable (<em>DA</em>
430a24&ndash;25).</li>

<li>Because the active mind is unaffected, we are not in a position to
remember&mdash;something or other at some time or other.
Unfortunately Aristotle does not specify what exactly we cannot
remember or when (<em>DA</em> 430a23&ndash;24).</li>

<li>Without this (<em>this</em> = either the passive mind or the active
mind), nothing thinks&mdash;or one thinks nothing (<em>DA</em>
430a25).</li>

</ul>

<p>

To the degree that there is agreement about these general claims,
there is commensurate disagreement about how each is to be understood
and developed.</p>

<p>
The ambiguity of the last claim provides a useful illustration of the
sorts of difficulties we encounter when we approach <em>De Anima</em>
iii 5 for careful study: in the phrase (&lsquo;without this nothing
thinks,&rsquo; or &lsquo;without this <em>x</em> thinks nothing&rsquo;;
<em>aneu toutou outhen noei</em>; 430a25), one cannot even be sure
about the intended referent of the demonstrative
&lsquo;<em>this&rsquo;</em> (<em>touto</em>) or about whether
&lsquo;nothing&rsquo; (<em>outhen</em>) is the subject or object of
&lsquo;thinks&rsquo; (<em>noei</em>). Thus, depending upon how it
is construed, Aristotle&rsquo;s Greek can be understood in at least
four different ways: (i) without the active mind, nothing thinks; (ii)
without the active mind, the passive mind thinks nothing; (iii) without
the passive mind, nothing thinks; and (iv) without the passive mind,
the active mind thinks nothing. These possibilities are not idle:
we find different commentators understanding Aristotle&rsquo;s text in
these markedly different
 ways.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
Each interpretation seems justifiable in
its own terms, and so none is indisputably to be preferred over its
competitors, at least not on narrowly linguistic grounds.
Interpretive questions thus begin without firm textual data. What
holds for this single phrase iterates through the entire chapter.</p>

<p>
Consequently, although some progress is to be made by minute
philological analysis of <em>De Anima</em> iii 5, the text as it stands
leaves unanswered many of the questions with which we began.
Evidently, if genuine progress is to be made regarding the final
purport of Aristotle&rsquo;s doctrine of the active mind, it will be
achieved by investigating <em>De Anima</em> iii 5 holistically, by
ascertaining, that is, how various hypotheses concerning its possible
claims and their likely significance integrate with other,
comparatively settled doctrines in Aristotelian psychology and
metaphysics.</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Cognitive Disability and Moral Status</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Perhaps the starkest illustration of this contrast is the
&ldquo;Animal Rule&rdquo; of the U.S. Federal Drug Administration,
which permits drug approval based on efficacy testing on animals
rather than humans, &ldquo;when human efficacy studies are not ethical
or feasible&rdquo; (21 CFR 314.600). Since animals studies have
greater evidentiary value for humans the greater the relevant
similarities between the animals studied and human beings, this rule
effectively makes those similarities&mdash;including cognitive
ones&mdash;a basis for exposing nonhuman animals to, rather than
protecting them from, harmful research (Walker and King 2011).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 We take the term &ldquo;radical&rdquo; from Jeff McMahan (2009), to
avoid the use of terms such as &ldquo;severe&rdquo; and
&ldquo;profound&rdquo;, which derive from psychometric classification.
We do not, however, use McMahan&rsquo;s label, &ldquo;radical
cognitive limitation,&rdquo; to refer to &ldquo;human beings whose
overall psychological capacities or potential are comparable to or
lower than those characteristic of the higher orders of nonhuman
animals&hellip; .&rdquo; (240). As McMahan acknowledges, the
appropriateness and intelligibility of the comparison are disputed by
some philosophers and disability scholars, and we do not want to adopt
a tendentious label when one of our objectives is to assess that very
claim. In some contexts, we will use the term &ldquo;impairment&rdquo;
rather than &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in recognition of a generation of
disability scholarship emphasizing the role of the social environment
in making both physical and mental disabilities disabling (see the
entry on
 <a href="../disability/index.html">disability: definitions, models, experience</a>).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Another approach, suggested by Hugh McLachlan (2016), would deny that
there is any single attribute necessary for full moral status. Drawing
on Wittgenstein&rsquo;s (1958) notion of &ldquo;family
resemblances,&rdquo; this approach would claim that individuals with
full moral status are linked by overlapping shared attributes, but
that no single (non-disjunctive) property is shared by all and only
individuals with full moral status. While this approach offers an
attractive flexibility to the determination of full moral status, it
raises difficult questions about what resemblances suffice for family
membership and why they do. It also leaves open the possibility that
some or many humans will lack sufficient resemblances of any kind.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 In outlining individually-based accounts of full moral status, we
will focus on single-attribute accounts. Multi-attribute accounts like
Warren&rsquo;s (1997) are potentially more inclusive in recognizing
more than one sufficient condition for moral status. But, as several
of Warren&rsquo;s critics have argued (Gunnarsson 2008; Hacker-Wright
2007), to treat an additional attribute, biological humanity, as a
sufficient condition along with self-consciousness and practical
agency, may just reframe the central question: why should human beings
have moral status just by virtue of their species-membership, while
non-humans must possess specific mental or moral attributes?</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 DeGrazia (2008), however, argues that an account of moral status
based on cognitive and other psychological attributes can accommodate
degrees as readily as an account based on interests.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 If, per Kain(2009), Kant himself held that all human beings had full
moral status, this suggests either that he was overly generous in his
attribution of the capacity for autonomy or that he grounded moral
status differently. In contrast to most contemporary Kantian accounts,
then, Kant may not have understood moral status as fully symmetrical,
in the sense of imposing reciprocal obligations. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Kant himself could be regarded as establishing a criterion for
membership in a moral community: the &ldquo;kingdom of ends.&rdquo;
But that criterion&mdash;the possession of a rational will &ndash;
does not appear to be based on, or justified in terms of, the
requirements for establishing interpersonal relationships or living in
a community of moral equals (although the content of the categorical
imperative may be understood in terms of the latter)&mdash;even if its
satisfaction enables us to establish such relationships or
communities.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Similarly, Russell DiSilvestro (2010) argues that all human beings
have the &ldquo;second-order capacity&rdquo;&mdash;the capacity to
acquire the capacity&mdash;for the cognitive capacities that ground
full moral status. Even the most radically impaired human beings have
that capacity if some future technology could endow them with the
relevant first-order capacity. In contrast, most non-human animals
lack that capacity, since the application of such future technology
would alter their identity&mdash;the beings that acquired the capacity
to think would not be them. This position rests on the claim that
natural-kind membership is a condition of identity&mdash;a claim that
may be no less controversial than the claim about second-order
capacity it is offered to support. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 The alignment of individual/group accounts and thin/thick concepts is
only partial. Not only do some group-based accounts rely on the
&ldquo;thin&rdquo; biological concept of species members, but some
intrinsic attributes, like Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;good will,&rdquo; are
regarded as inherently moral.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 One critic of individually-based accounts does not fit into either
group of alternative accounts. Edwards (1997) questions the
individualism of individually-based accounts rather than their focus
on specific attributes. He argues that individualism about selves
promotes an excessive emphasis on independence, denigrating the moral
status of individuals with a wide range of disabilities.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Moreover, as Christopher Grau (2015) observes, McMahan himself
recognizes that such reference groups as classmates or colleagues may
be relevant to judgments of misfortune. It is not clear why all human
beings should not comprise another relevant reference class. Even if
they are, however, the question remains of why those unfortunate in
falling below species norms for morally relevant attributes should
enjoy the moral status associated with those attributes (see 4.1,
5.2).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Such kinship might be attenuated by exo-gestation, especially if it
was combined with genetic engineering and mass production. But those
prospects raise the question of what is required to be human, which is
beyond the scope of this entry.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 A similar view, relying on human connections broader than personal
relationships, has been proposed by Eva Kittay (2005), who argues that
moral status arises from a social matrix, understood in the following
terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
By a social relationship, I mean a place in a matrix of relationships
embedded in social practices through which the relations acquire
meanings. It is by virtue of the meanings that relationships acquire
in social practices that duties are delineated, ways we enter and exit
relationships are determined, emotional responses are deemed
attractive, and so forth. A social relationship in this sense need not
be dependant on ongoing interpersonal relationships between conscious
individuals. (111)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On this approach, it is not the mere biological fact of species
membership that obliges third-parties to treat the severely-disabled
children and siblings of other human beings with respect. Those
third-parties are caught up in the <em>same</em> matrix of social
relationships, which also determines their duties to others. Kittay
does not explain, however, how such a matrix is bounded, or how it
gives rise to specific duties.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Although some humanists may assume that humanity is coextensive with
membership in <em>Homo sapiens</em>, that assumption is not necessary
to their position. Contrary to Julian Savulescu (2009), they would not
regard it as a tragedy if it were found that half the human population
&ldquo;is not carbon based but silicon based, even though they look,
behave, and experience the same.&rdquo; For most humanists, that
discovery would merely confirm that &ldquo;humanity&rdquo; was not a
strictly biological concept, but a linguistic or cultural one, based
in part on affinities in appearance, behavior, and experience. The
concept of humanity, and the classification of an individual as human,
can only be understood in terms of a network of social practices or
&ldquo;forms of life.&rdquo; Even if it did turn out that being a Homo
sapiens was necessary and sufficient for being a human being, the
moral status of human beings would not be grounded in their
biology.</p>

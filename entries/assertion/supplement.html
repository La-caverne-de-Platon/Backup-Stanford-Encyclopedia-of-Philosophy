<h2>Which Kind of Norm?</h2>

<p>
In this supplementary note, we present some alternative views about
which kind of norm governs assertion, exploring some objections to the
key assumptions made by standard accounts. In the discussion below we
first report each assumption (as a reminder for the reader), and then
provide a critical discussion of it.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="speci">(A1)</dt>
<dd><em>Specificity</em>: <em>N</em> applies specifically to
assertion: only assertions are subject to <em>N</em>.</dd>
<dt id="direct">(A1*)</dt>
<dd><em>Directness</em>: Assertions are subject to <em>N</em>
directly, qua assertions.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Against <em>Specificity</em> and <em>Directness</em>, some authors
construe the norm of assertion as a particular instance of a more
general norm with a wider scope of application: for instance, a norm
regulating all practical reasoning (i.e., reasoning that motivates
practical action, of which assertion is a particular case). On this
&ldquo;commonality view&rdquo;, <em>N</em> is not specific to
assertion, but to another, more general action-type A, of which
assertion represent a particular instance (Hawthorne 2004; Stanley
2005; Hawthorne &amp; Stanley 2008; Smithies 2012; Montminy 2013b; see
also Fantl &amp; McGrath 2009). A compelling case against commonality
is made in Brown (2012), McKenna (2013), and Gerken (2014) (although
Gerken defends a weaker version, structural commonality); for a
review, see Gerken and Petersen (2020). An alternative route is
explored by Brogaard (2014), who derives KNA from a more general norm
of intellectual flourishing. Other derivation strategies are explored
in Douven (2006) and Smithies (2012).</p>

<p>
Another way to challenge <em>Specificity</em> is to hold that there
are other speech acts that are subject to the same norm <em>N</em>.
Marsili (2015) argues that, if <em>N</em> regulates assertion, then
it&rsquo;s plausible that <em>N</em> will also regulate every speech
act whose sincerity conditions are stronger than (or equivalent to)
those of assertions (in Searle &amp; Vanderveken 1985&rsquo;s
sense)&mdash;such as swearing, warning, confessing, denying,
admitting, and so forth. Consider</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="ate">(1)</dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="atea">a.</dt>
<dd>I ate all your biscuits.</dd>
<dt id="ateb">b.</dt>
<dd>I admit that I ate all your biscuits.</dd>
<dt id="atec">c.</dt>
<dd>I swear that I ate all your biscuits.</dd>
<dt id="ated">d.</dt>
<dd>I warn you that I ate all your biscuits.</dd>
</dl> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The suggestion is that if (1a) must meet the epistemic standards set
by <em>N</em>, so must (1b), (1c), and (1d).</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="uniq">(A2)</dt>
<dd><em>Uniqueness</em>: There is only one norm of assertion:
assertion is only subject to <em>N</em></dd>
<dt id="indir">(A2*)</dt>
<dd><em>Indirectness</em>: Assertions are subject to other normative
standards, but only indirectly (not in virtue of the fact that they
are assertions).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<em>Uniqueness</em> is often dropped in the literature. As DeRose
(2002: fn 15) points out, (A2) is &ldquo;little more than an item of
faith for Williamson, with no justification offered other than that a
simple account consisting of such a single rule would be
&lsquo;theoretically satisfying&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo;. For this
reason, several authors have explicitly taken a stance against this
assumption (Brown 2008; Carter &amp; Gordon 2011; Gerken 2014; McKenna
2015; Carter 2017; Marsili forthcoming-a).</p>

<p>
Others have advanced positive proposals that are in tension with
<em>Uniqueness</em>, suggesting that different standards of
assertability apply in different contexts. This line has been taken by
several authors (cf. DeRose 2002; Stone 2007; Levin 2008; Gerken 2012,
2014, 2017; Goldberg 2015: chs 10&ndash;11; McKinnon 2015).</p>

<p>
Some of these accounts hold that different norms apply in different
contexts, while others postulate a single context sensitive norm,
according to which the standard of acceptability depends on the
context (in some contexts, knowledge is required; in others, something
less demanding is enough, such as justified belief). Greenough (2011)
takes this line even further by proposing norm-relativism: what norm
is relevant for an assertion in a context is relative to a
perspective. Carter and Gordon (2011) reject altogether a
&ldquo;quantitative view&rdquo; of the epistemic support needed for
asserting, to which they prefer a &ldquo;qualitative view&rdquo;,
according to which different assertions can be subject to radically
different kinds of epistemic standards (e.g., understanding something
vs knowing it).</p>

<p>
A question arises about these contextual views. If the speech act type
is individuated by the norm governing it, and norms of utterances vary
between contexts, is it then still the case that one and the same
(illocutionary) speech act type is performed across contexts? One who
has denied this is John Turri (2010). Reviving an influential view
(cf. Searle &amp; Vanderveken 1985: 98&ndash;99), Turri suggests a
class of &ldquo;alethic&rdquo; speech acts, including
<em>conjecturing</em>, <em>asserting</em>, and <em>guaranteeing</em>.
The first is weaker and the third stronger than assertion. They are
ranked on a so-called &ldquo;credibility index&rdquo; (2010: 85),
depending on what degree of credibility is required by the speech act
type. In contexts with different demands on credibility, different
speech acts are performed. For assertion itself, the standard is
invariant: it is simply knowledge.</p>

<p>
A more radical conclusion has been drawn by Herman Cappelen (2011,
2020). According to Cappelen, the context-sensitivity of our normative
expectations suggests that assertion as a speech act type
doesn&rsquo;t exist. The term &ldquo;assertion&rdquo; fails to pick
out an act-type that we engage in, and it is not a category we need in
order to explain any significant component of our linguistic practice
(2011: 21). From similar considerations, Greenberg (forthcoming) draws
a weaker conclusion: that there is no <em>suis-generis </em>norm of
assertion (just norms of actions that apply <em>also </em>to
assertion).</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="indiv">(A3)</dt>
<dd><em>Individuation</em>: The condition of <em>N</em> uniquely
identifies assertion: assertion is the only speech act that is only
subject to <em>N</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Recall that accepting <em>Individuation </em>means that we can define
assertion as follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="normdef">(D)</dt>
<dd>S asserts that <em>p</em> iff in saying <em>p</em>, S is subject
to the obligation imposed by <em>N</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Against <em>Individuation</em>, MacFarlane (2011: 86) and Maitra
(2011: 282) have questioned whether a definition of this sort really
explains what an assertion is. (D) does not really tell us what it is
to assert something, or what kind of action it is. It specifies which
specific obligation one incurs when they token this action-type, but
does not tell us what that action-type is, or what it is to token
it.</p>

<p>
Accepting <em>Individuation</em> entails accepting both
 <a href="#speci">(A1)</a>
 (<em>Specificity</em>) and
 <a href="#indir">(A2)</a>
 (<em>Uniqueness</em>): it is therefore conditional on their validity.
Since both assumptions are contested, this means that
 <a href="#indiv">(A3)</a>
 rests on shaky grounds (cf. MacFarlane 2011: 86; Marsili
forthcoming-a: &sect;6). If the objections to
 <a href="#speci">(A1)</a>
 are sound, you can be subject to <em>N</em> even if you are not
asserting: the sufficiency leg of
 <a href="#normdef">(D)</a>
 does not hold. And if the objections to (A4) (below) are sound, you
do not need to be subject to <em>N</em> to assert: the necessity leg
of
 <a href="#normdef">(D)</a>
 does not hold.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="esse">(A4)</dt>
<dd><em>Essentiality</em>: Being subject to <em>N</em> is essential to
assertion as an action type: Necessarily, assertion is subject to
<em>N</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Rescorla (2007) argues that a norm of truthfulness cannot be essential
to assertion in this sense. Garc&iacute;a-Carpintero (2019a) urges us
to distinguish between the claim that <em>N</em> is essential to
assertion in this sense, but not actually in force (and the
action-type not instantiated in the community) and the claim that
<em>N</em> is essential to assertion <em>and</em> actually in force
(for the idea of a norm&rsquo;s being in force, see below). According
to Dummett (1976: 89), it is a matter of convention and personal
strategy what counts as warranting assertion; assertability does not
individuate the speech act type.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="permi">(A5)</dt>
<dd><em>Permissibility</em>: <em>N</em> establishes a condition for
permissible assertion: <em>p</em> is permissible to assert only if
<em>p</em> meets <em>C</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Some authors have proposed to relax <em>Permissibility</em>, typically
to defend KNA from the objection that it is too demanding (cf. section
 <a href="index-2.html#WhicNormAsse">5.1.4</a>).
 Adler (2002: 235, 275) distinguishes between proper assertions,
requiring knowledge, and <em>warranted</em> assertions, requiring full
belief. Mehta (2016) has argued that KNA would be more plausible if
understood as setting a standard for a <em>successful</em> assertion,
rather than a permissible one. In a similar spirit, Turri (2014)
argues that KNA sets the standard for asserting <em>well</em>, rather
than permissibly. On this view (abandoned by Turri in subsequent
work), knowledge is &ldquo;supererogatory&rdquo;: it exceeds what
assertion requires (just rational belief) but it also sets the optimal
epistemic ground to make an assertion. Similar points have been made
about the role of truth in determining assertability. Marsili (2018)
argues that the data accommodated by factive norms (KNA, TNA) would be
better explained by a view that takes truth to be the aim (standard
for success), rather than the rule (standard for permissibility) of
assertion.</p>

<p>
Different formal interpretations of <em>Permissibility</em> in deontic
logic have been offered by Schl&ouml;der (2018), McIntosh (2020) and
Rosenkranz (forthcoming).</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="consti">(A6)</dt>
<dd><em>Constitutivity</em>: <em>N</em> is the constitutive norm of
assertion.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
There is substantial (and often unacknowledged) disagreement about
what constitutivity amounts to. A reason for this divergence of
interpretations is that there is a pre-existing tradition in speech
act theory (and social ontology) that opposes &ldquo;constitutive
rules&rdquo; to &ldquo;regulative rules&rdquo;. According to a fairly
common interpretation of this distinction (e.g., Midgley 1959,
Hindriks 2007), constitutive rules are like definitions: they specify
descriptive (non-prescriptive) requirements that a brute entity must
meet in order to constitute another (socially constituted) entity
(e.g., if one extracts Excalibur, one counts as the King); since these
rules are non-prescriptive definitions, they cannot be violated (at
most, they can fail to be enforced). Regulative rules, by contrast,
are said to impose prescriptions (e.g., &ldquo;If you drive, you must
keep the right&rdquo;) that can be violated in the strict sense of the
word. Since (by
 <a href="#permi">(A5)</a>)
 <em>N</em> imposes a genuine prescription that can be violated, on
this understanding of the constitutive/regulative opposition
<em>N</em> is regulative, rather than constitutive (cf. Hindriks 2007:
396; Maitra 2011; McCammon 2014: 137&ndash;9; Marsili forthcoming-a:
&sect;5).</p>

<p>
This ambiguity generates substantial disagreement about what
 <a href="#consti">(A6)</a>
 is supposed to mean: some authors (Rescorla 2007: 253; 2009a: 99;
Turri 2013: 281) take <em>N</em> to be &ldquo;constitutive&rdquo; in
the received speech-act theoretic sense. Others challenge the
traditional reception of the constitutive-regulative distinction, in
favor of one that takes some (Garc&iacute;a-Carpintero 2019a,
forthcoming) or all (Pagin 1987; Reiland 2020) constitutive rules to
be prescriptive. Marsili (forthcoming-a) identifies some problems for
both interpretations.</p>

<p>
The prevalent interpretation of
 <a href="#consti">(A6)</a>
 takes it to denote the conjunction of <em>Essence</em>
 <a href="#esse">(A4)</a>
 and <em>Individuation</em>
 <a href="#indiv">(A3)</a>&mdash;which,
 in turn, entails the truth of <em>Specificity</em>
 <a href="#speci">(A1)</a>
 and <em>Uniqueness</em>
 <a href="#uniq">(A2)</a>.
 This interpretation of what &ldquo;constitutive&rdquo; means better
tracks Williamson&rsquo;s foundational discussion of <em>N</em>, but
so interpreted
 <a href="#consti">(A6)</a>
 is a very strong claim. Unsurprisingly, it is highly contested.</p>

<p>
The <em>Constitutivity</em> assumption is usually defended in
conjunction with an analogy with games (Williamson 1996: 489). Just as
chess it is constituted by its rules, it is said, assertion is
constituted by its norm. Usually, this assumption is followed by the
consideration that, in order to play a game, one must display a
reasonable amount of sensitivity to its rules. For instance, if you
move pawns diagonally on the chessboard as if they were bishops, and
your opponent does not object to it, it seems that you are not really
playing chess.</p>

<p>
Against the constitutivity claim, Pagin (2011) has argued that insofar
as there are norms of assertion, their status among speakers do not
much resemble rules of games. Firstly, players of a game rarely
disagree about what the rules of the game are. If there is a
disagreement, it is settled either by appeal to a generally recognized
authority, such as a rule-book, or by stipulation, if it concerns a
new case to be covered by rules. We don&rsquo;t find players appealing
to intuition or the oddity of certain conversational patterns to
convince each other of claims about what the rules are, as in the
norms-of-assertion debate.</p>

<p>
Moreover, as stressed in Pagin (2016b), if speakers are assumed to
<em>know</em> what speech act they perform by knowing which norms
govern it, and they do perform the same speech
act&mdash;<em>assertion</em>&mdash;then they should also agree about
what the norms are. The debate over assertion shows that this is not
the case. It is not just disagreement over general principles, but
also disagreement about individual cases (e.g., over <em>unlucky
assertions</em>; see section
 <a href="index-2.html#WhicNormAsse">5.1.4</a>
 on objections against
 <a href="index-2.html#williB">(KNA)</a>).
 Mona Simion and Christoph Kelp (2020: 61&ndash;53) have objected that
disagreement among philosophers is only disagreement over general
principles, and that, <em>pace</em> Pagin, speakers actually agree
over individual cases. In this objection, however, Simion and Kelp
only take into account philosophical agreement over intuitions about
particular cases, and pass silence on the disagreement about their
evidential weight, and about whether these intuitions can be explained
away (e.g. by appeal to the distinction between primary and secondary
propriety, cf. section
 <a href="index-2.html#WhicNormAsse">5.1.4</a>).
 Once the full picture is taken into consideration, it seems hard to
deny that philosophers strongly disagree about the norm governing
assertion.</p>

<p>
Another problem with the game analogy concerns being <em>in
force</em>. For a constituted game action type, like castling in
chess, to be performable at all, the rules of chess must by some
decision be in force; if the rules of chess are not in force for a
person at a particular time, her moving two pieces of wood at that
time does not constitute castling (cf. Pagin 1987: ch. 3; Gl&uuml;er
&amp; Pagin 1998). But this again seems very unlike the relation of
norms to assertion. It does not seem that an utterance is recognizable
as an assertion in virtue of a decision to regard it as subject to
this or that norm. Rather, it seems that recognizing an utterance as
an assertion precedes seeing it as subject to evaluation (cf.
MacFarlane 2011: 85&ndash;87).</p>

<p>
The question about being in force is fundamental: in virtue of what is
a norm of assertion in force for a speaker or a speech community, if
it is in force? Is it because of a collective acceptance? If so, it
must be tacit, and, because of the wide disagreement among theorists,
usually not accessible to introspection. Is it because of some
metaphysical fact that assertions are essentially governed by this or
that norm whenever they are performed, and whatever speakers think
about it? That would indeed make sense of the debate, since it can be
construed as an investigation into normative reality. But there
remains a question of what influence normative reality has on
linguistic practice. Probably none (or at best a pretty haphazard one,
judging from the disagreement). Is it perhaps something internal to
each speaker, and not intersubjectively shared? That can explain the
differences among the participants in the debate. But it is hard to
square this with the assumption that we share a practice of making and
understanding assertions. If you and I accept different norms, then I
simply misapply my norm to your utterances when interpreting them, and
consequently systematically misinterpret your utterances. But for all
we can tell, this does not generally seem to happen. This remains a
challenge to the norm approach (cf. Pagin 1987, 2016b;
Garc&iacute;a-Carpintero 2019a).</p>

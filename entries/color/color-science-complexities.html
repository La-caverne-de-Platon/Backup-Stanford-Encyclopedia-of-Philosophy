<h2>Color Science &ndash; Some Complexities</h2>

<p>
In this section, we will take note of some introductory points about
color science. At the end of the section, there are some references
that should be of help to the student of color.</p>

<p>
In 1988, C.L. Hardin published a book that was a landmark in the
philosophy of color. The book was entitled <em>Color for
Philosophers</em>, and was significant in bringing to the attention of
philosophers the enormous amount of progress that has been made in
color science, particularly in the realm of color vision. Until then,
many philosophers writing on color, had made do with a small number of
well-worn examples. Since then, the philosophy of color has, in
general, been much more well-informed. Hardin&rsquo;s book, upgraded
in 1993, is still a good introduction to the subject, but more
recently, Hardin has published another article, &ldquo;More Color
Science for Philosophers&rdquo; (2014), that describes considerable
progress that has been made since (and the difficulties that
remain).</p>

<p>
Color science is a flourishing field of science, with a long history
that goes back to Newton (and Descartes and Boyle), and includes such
famous figures as Young, Maxwell, Helmholtz, and Hering. While there
has been widespread doubt about the existence of color as a physical
reality, this has not stopped the growth of an enormous amount of
research into color: into the mechanisms underlying color vision, into
ways of specifying the ways colors appear, and into constructing
systems to order colors. While much of this research has been directed
at human color vision, there has been a growing amount addressing
animal color vision. In other words, no one doubts that there is such
a thing as color vision.</p>

<p>
One line of research focuses on the chemistry and physics of color.
This includes the study of how the material properties of physical
bodies alter the composition of the light they transmit or reflect or
emit or scatter, and of the character, and composition, of the light
involved. These causes, as Nassau points out, are many and varied. He
refers to an &ldquo;informal classification [that] &hellip; has some
14 category of causes&rdquo; (Nassau 1983: 3). Much of the research in
color science, however, is devoted, directly or indirectly, to color
perception, and to studying the complex physiological and neurological
mechanisms underlying color vision. </p>

<p>
One important area of study has to deal with the construction of color
spaces, which are spaces for ordering the colors systematically. There
are different spaces constructed for different purposes (see Kuehni
2003, 2010). One type of color space is dealt with in the field of
colorimetry, which is a branch of color science concerned with
&ldquo;measuring&rdquo; color, which means specifying numerically the
color of visual stimulus (either a light or an object). We do this, in
the simplest case, by specifying the mixture of three reference lights
that match the stimulus (i.e., appear the same), under specific
viewing conditions, and illumination. </p>

<p>
Central types of color space are psychological color systems, i.e., of
ways of ordering, in a systematic fashion, the range of
colors&mdash;colors as perceived&mdash;in a three-dimensional
coordinate system, within which each possible perceived color can be
represented as a single point with a unique position. It is important
to note that there are different systems that have been constructed.
For one thing, different dimensions are used, depending on the way in
which color appears. Colors as properties of surfaces, in general,
have a different mode of appearance from colors as properties of
volumes such as wine, and yet again from that for film color or
aperture color (the color of an object or light source viewed through
an aperture in a reduction screen). These different modes of
appearance suit different dimensions of color. For aperture or film
colors, and light sources, the dimensions are hue, saturation and
brightness; for surfaces, the dimensions are hue, chroma and value
(lightness)&mdash;Munsell&mdash;and hue, chromaticness and
whiteness/blackness&mdash;Swedish Natural Color System (NCS). </p>

<p>
A wide range of psychological phenomena related to color perception
has been studied. Many concern the conditions of perception, e.g., the
field in which color-constancy, simultaneous contrast, the effects of
various backgrounds on color perceptions, and so on, are examined, and
competing explanations debated. One striking phenomenon is the
existence of certain surface colors&mdash;contrast colors&mdash;.
Contrast colors are colors whose appearance depends essentially on
contrast effects. They include many of the common everyday colors:
brown, olive, pure white, pure black (for discussion, see Cohen 2009:
23). Another important discovery has been the extent of the variation
there is, among normal color perceivers, in the perception of specific
shades of color. Some reference should also be made to the growing
literature on color constancy, a topic which, for many of us, is very
puzzling. For an excellent recent survey, see W. Wright, 2013. See
also Matthen 2010 and D.H. Brown 2014.</p>

<p>
One of the most vigorous areas of research, especially more recently,
is the study of color vision, i.e., of the mechanisms involved in the
perception of color. Helmholtz and Hering were pioneers in the
physiology of this area, the former contributing to the Trichromatic
theory, and the latter to the development of the Opponent Process
Theory. Originally these theories were seen as rivals, but much of the
research in the second part of the twentieth century has pointed to
them explaining complementary parts of the visual processes. </p>

<p>
According to the Trichromatic theory, there are in the retinas of the
eyes (for normal perceivers) three types of cones, which contain
different visual pigments, maximally sensitive, respectively, to
different wavelength of light: long, medium and short. The cones are
commonly referred to as the <i>L</i>, <i>M</i> and <i>S</i> cones,
respectively. The stimulation of these pigments does not correspond in
any simple way to the experiences of color. The Opponent-Process
theory postulates computational mechanisms in the visual system to
explain how the outputs of these cones lead to the experiences.
According to this theory, the outputs of the three cone-types are
transformed into two opponent chromatic signals and one non-opponent
achromatic signal. It is thought that there are pairs of opponent
information channels, where the activity in one channel inhibits
activity in an opponent channel. The pairs of channels are supposed to
be linked to &ldquo;red/green responses&rdquo;, and to
&ldquo;blue/yellow responses&rdquo; respectively. Letting the cone
outputs for the long, medium and short wave cones be <i>L</i>,
<i>M</i> and <i>S</i>, the red-green signal is \(L - M\), the
yellow-blue signal is (\(L + M) -S\), and the achromatic signal is \(L
+ M\). Concentrating on the two chromatic signals, if \(L - M &gt; 0\)
then the red-green signal produces a &ldquo;red response&rdquo;, and a
&ldquo;green response&rdquo;, if \(L - M &lt; 0\). Similarly, the
yellow-blue signal produces a &ldquo;yellow response&rdquo;, if \((L +
M) - S &gt; 0\), and a &ldquo;blue response&rdquo; if \((L + M) - S
&lt; 0\). With such a theory, we seem to have a natural explanation
for how we have say experiences of unique red, unique green, unique
blue, unique yellow. (To have the color of unique red is to have a
color that has no blue or yellow component.) It also explains why we
have experiences of bluish-reds, and yellowish-reds, but not
greenish-reds.</p>

<p>
It should be borne in mind that the theory described above has the
status of a simplified model. Finding solid neurophysiological
evidence confirming the theory is proving difficult. For accounts of
the complexities, see Abramov 1997 and MacLeod 2010. Some experimental
data go against the model. As Hardin points out, certain color-blind
dichromats, with only two functioning cones, and supposedly bereft of
experiences of red and green, nevertheless seem to have some such
experiences (Hardin 2008: 145&ndash;146; for an even more dissenting
view, see Jameson 2010).</p>

<p>
One of the areas of vision science that is of particular current
interest is that concerned, broadly, with what might be termed the
function of color vision. There are a number of authors that bring out
the philosophical implications of this research, e.g., Akins &amp;
Hahn 2014, Chirimuuta &amp; Kingdom 2015. They argue that both the
philosophy of color and much recent vision science have been guided by
certain simplistic views about the function of color vision. They also
bring out well the extent to which much recent work in color vision is
controversial. Akins and Hahn ask the question: What is the function
of human color vision? To this they reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For most vision researchers, both philosophers and scientists, the
answer is obvious, nay, a tautology: colour vision is for seeing the
colours, whether or not colour is genuine property of the external
world. (Akins &amp; Hahn 2014: 126) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In their article, they want to deny the assumption that human cortical
color vision is &ldquo;for&rdquo; seeing the colors. Instead, our
&ldquo;color&rdquo; system is better understood as two chromatic
contrast systems, each of which encodes additional information about
the retinal image and which, individually, increase our capacity for
wavelength discrimination. (See Mausfeld 2010, for even more trenchant
criticism of orthodox approaches.)</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>

<p>
For an introductory accessible overview of color vision, the reader is
referred to Palmer 1999, chapter 3. For a more
philosophically-oriented work, see Hardin 1988, 2014; Byrne &amp;
Hilbert 1997b; Cohen &amp; Matthen 2010. The articles by Chirimuuta
&amp; Kingdom (2015) and Akins &amp; Hahn (2014), have copious
references to recent research in vision science.</p>

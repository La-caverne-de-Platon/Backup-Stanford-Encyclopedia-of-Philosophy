<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Public Health Ethics</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 For example, the Institute of Medicine defines public health as
&ldquo;what we, as a society, do collectively to assure the conditions
in which people can be healthy&rdquo; (IOM 1988; IOM 2003).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 The 2014&ndash;2015 Ebola outbreaks in multiple West African countries are
some of the many examples illustrating the limitations of national
efforts in the control of infectious disease.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Private actors other than NGOs, especially for-profit industries,
also play a role in producing public health. For instance,
pharmaceutical companies develop vaccines or anti-biotics that are
integral to preventing infectious disease. Engineers develop
technologies that can be used to provide citizens with clean water or
air. Yet it sounds odd to say that these activities constitute public
health interventions. These private actors focus on developing the
relevant medicine or technologies rather than ensuring that people
have access to them. By analogy, it would be odd to claim biotech
startups that develop medical technologies that are used by care
providers in the clinical setting are, themselves, providing patients
with medical care. Of course, how government ought to regulate these
actors is an ethical question with significant implications for public
health.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 This description does not apply to libertarian theories that we
discuss in Section 3.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Some theorists resist conceptualizing health inequalities in terms of
groups and instead defend a methodology in which variation in health
focuses on health status across individuals rather than across groups.
For a discussion of this debate, see Section 4, of the entry on
Justice, Inequality and Health.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Cost-effectiveness analysis uses natural measures like average
five-year survival or infant mortality to assess the relative
efficiency or value for money of alternative interventions to address
the same or similar health problem using the same outcome (For
instance, it compares different drugs for lung cancer or different
interventions to reduce infant mortality). CEA is open to many of the
same ethical defenses and criticisms as CUA.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 For a discussion of the distinction between scarce and non-scare
resources, see (Ubel and Goold 1998).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 As we discuss below, the distinction between prevention and treatment
is blurred, or there are cases of
&lsquo;treatment-as-prevention&rsquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 See, for example, Baicker, Cutler and Song (2010); Bolnick, Millard
and Dugas (2013); and Schmidt, Stock and Doran (2012).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 A recurrent theme in these defenses is that even if very small
benefits to each member of a group add up to larger overall benefit
than saving one life, we should still save the one life. So, for
instance, if forced to choose between saving one person&rsquo;s life
and eliminating the sore throat of everyone in the world, many would
balk at choosing to eliminate the sore throats of
everyone &ndash; even if, on some metric of well-being,
eliminating the sore throats were to produce better overall welfare.
(Kamm 1993, 1994) In reply, some argue that not all rescue will be for
such severe harms, nor will all preventive efforts be for such trivial
harms. Moreover, the concern about aggregating trivial benefits can
seem misplaced when considering health policy measures that will
actually save some statistical lives, and comparing such measures to
rescue of identified lives. For this sort of reply, see (Hope 2001;
Sheehan 2007).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Sometimes &lsquo;rule of rescue&rsquo; is used to refer to the
psychological phenomenon we refer to as the &lsquo;identified victim
effect&rsquo; or there is not much distinction between the
psychological phenomenon and the moral imperative. We use it to refer
to the moral imperative for purposes of clarity and simplicity.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Even if one might think that the rule of rescue should not inform
allocation decisions or priority-setting, some argue it still has an
important role to play in the clinical setting. (Cookson and McCabe
and Tsuchiya 2007; Hughes and Walker 2009).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 See Samuel Moyn for a discussion of this approach in (Moyn 2018).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Philosophers disagree about the significance of the distinction
between justice and mere humanitarian duties. Typically, duties of
justice are viewed as more stringent, corresponding to someone&rsquo;s
rights, and hence not simply matters of charity for which the donor
has wide discretion about whom to assist, how much, and in what
manner; see (Barry 1982).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 A qualification is relevant here &ndash; namely, that the
poverty in question does not occur in a vacuum but is caused by global
economic institutions, and certain kinds of interaction between
wealthier and poorer nations. Indeed, this point is important to
making the case that global health is a matter of justice rather than
beneficence. We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing out this
important qualification</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 Legitimacy questions have also been raised about the activities of
pan-national organizations and private actors such as large
philanthropies, but these questions have attracted far less scrutiny
in public health ethics.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Here it is worth noting that the sense of legitimacy we discuss is
normative, rather than descriptive. Normative legitimacy concerns the
conditions under which government exercises of coercive power are
actually morally permissible, rather than the conditions under which
citizens judge that the government permissibly exercises its power. A
second important clarification is that some draw a distinction between
a right to make law and a moral power to obligate citizens to obey the
law. The term &lsquo;legitimacy&rsquo; often gets used to refer to
both of these concepts (Simmons 1999) but in recent years, a growing
number of scholars have emphasized the importance of differentiating
them. For this distinction, see, esp., (Applbaum 2010; Buchanan 2002;
Edmundson 1999; Zhu 2016). Finally, some sharply divide
&lsquo;legitimacy&rsquo; and &lsquo;justification,&rsquo; such that
theories of public justification do not constitute theories of
legitimacy (Simmons 1999). We largely ignore this distinction for
purposes of simplicity, although it informs some of the views we
discuss. For instance, various public reason theorists or proponents
of the liberty tradition might insist that regardless of whether
various considerations ultimately justify implementing a particular
policy, this does not suffice to show that the state has the right to
implement such policies &ndash; such policies might be said to be
justified but illegitimate.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 In this entry, we typically use &lsquo;liberty&rsquo; and
&lsquo;freedom&rsquo; as rough synonyms, although at certain places we
specify different senses of these concepts, especially when discussing
republican challenges to freedom as non-interference, or what Isaiah
Berlin influentially dubbed &lsquo;negative liberty&rsquo; (Berlin
1958). For work that brings to bear notions of relational autonomy to
public health ethics, see esp., (Baylis et al. 2008).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 A classic example is when an outbreak of measles can be traced to the
intentional under-vaccination of children by their parents (Omerand et
al. 2009; Thompson et al. 2007; Sugarman et al. 2010).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Again, this is similar to the case of the free market: by and large
it is preferable to have free markets than not to have them, but this
does not render specific aspects of its operations immune to criticism
and reform from an ethical point of view.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 There are a variety of definitions of paternalism that are more or
less expansive. For instance, Jonathan Quong defines paternalism as
involving two conditions: &ldquo;1) Agent A attempts to improve the
welfare, good, happiness, needs, interests, or values of agent B with
regard to a particular decision or situation that B faces. 2) A&rsquo;s act
is motivated by a negative judgment about B&rsquo;s ability (assuming B has
the relevant information] to make the right decision or manage the
particular situation in a way that will effectively advance B&rsquo;s
welfare, good, happiness, needs, interests, or values,&rsquo; (Quong
2011, 80). Other definitions that are broader than the one we use
include (Shiffrin 2000). We do not explore these debates about
paternalism for three reasons. First, whether one deems paternalism
morally objectionable for the reasons we articulate will depend on the
definition of paternalism one adopts. So, for instance, someone might
agree that paternalism as defined by Dworkin is illegitimate but deny
that paternalism as defined by Quong is illegitimate. It would be
unwieldy and distracting to explore the variety of definitions of
paternalism and the possible normative assessments of paternalism.
Second, we opt for Dworkin&rsquo;s definition because, independent of
whether it is the best way to conceptualize paternalism, it is an
especially prominent definition employed in public health ethics.
Third, a more expansive view of paternalism, along with the claim that
paternalistic interventions are illegitimate, would entail a very
restrictive view about the appropriate scope of government activity.
Yet we discuss something like these views in the subsection on the
liberty tradition. Accordingly, one could defend the liberty tradition
by appealing to (a) a more expansive definition of paternalism than we
use and (b) the normative claim that government paternalism is
illegitimate.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 Ignorance and false beliefs are not usually sufficient to make a
preference subject to interference, and generally require
supplementing by stronger considerations such as age or cognitive
disability or harm to others (e.g. one&rsquo;s child) on the basis of
one&rsquo;s own ignorance or false beliefs. In the normal course of
things, we all have at least some preferences based on ignorance and
false beliefs that proponents of soft paternalism nonetheless do not
think can legitimately be interfered with unless there is some
compelling reason to impute impairment of rationality beyond, say,
weakness of will.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 Some object to this claim. Serene Khader, for instance, raises a
powerful challenge to the idea that adaptive preferences should be
construed as non-autonomous. See (Khader 2009; 2012).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 For an argument in defense of restrictive policies on the sale of
cigarettes, see esp., (Goodin 1990). Some object that this line of
argument over-generalizes because our agency is compromised in many
domains other than public health, yet we do not think this warrants
similar forms of interference in those domains (Grill and Voigt
2016).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 This is often accompanied by a much stronger view of the legitimacy
of external judgments about what is really in a person&rsquo;s interest, and
a stronger likelihood to question individuals&rsquo; own assessment of their
best interests than alternative, softer versions of paternalism.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 Consider, for example, the debate in the United States about the
appropriateness and necessity of isolating asymptomatic health
professionals returning from providing care to Ebola patients in West
Africa.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>
 Here it is worth noting that Accountability for Reasonableness is
often framed as a matter of justice or fairness, or procedural justice
or fairness the latter of which is often invoked as a requirement for
legitimacy. We focus on the legitimacy dimension of Accountability for
Reasonableness.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 For instance, Alexander Freidman writes that employing A4R leaves
decision-makers &ldquo;&hellip;saddled with an abstract debate in
political philosophy with regard to which there is no consensus, which
requires resolving disputes about the very nature and foundations of
the political process and of democratic legitimacy, and the views on
which have a significant degree of correlation with the very moral
positions in question. Instead of limiting moral disagreement and
making it more tractable, the Relevance Condition now forces us to
address highly abstract and extremely contentious debates in political
philosophy before we can even begin to deal with the moral
disagreement itself,&rdquo; (Friedman 2008, 107).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>
 The passage cited by Baylis, Kenny, and Sherwin appears in Bruce
Jennings&rsquo;s articulation of a civic republican approach to public
health ethics, an approach that has garnered significant attention in
recent years.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>
 This view is also reflected in a long-standing position in public
health that policies should employ the least restrictive measure
possible to secure their public health objectives. See, esp. (Upshur
2002; Childress et al. 2002, 173; Gostin 2008, 142).</p>

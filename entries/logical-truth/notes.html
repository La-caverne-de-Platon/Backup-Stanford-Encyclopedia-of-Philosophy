<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Logical Truth</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 A common view is that logic is fundamentally concerned with
characterizing (and giving us practical means to tell apart) a
peculiar set of truth-preserving arguments, the arguments in which the
 conclusion is a
 <a href="../logical-consequence/index.html">logical consequence</a>
 of the
premises. On most views, in cases of logical consequence the
conclusion follows with a special modal force from the premises (in
some sense of &ldquo;could&rdquo;, the conclusion could not be false if the
premises are true); and the conclusion follows &ldquo;formally&rdquo; from the
premises, at least in the sense that all arguments which are
replacement instances of the argument's form are cases of logical
consequence too (where the notion of the form of an argument is
understood in the obvious way in terms of the notion of the form of a
sentence). The following English arguments are paradigmatic examples
of logical consequence:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(1+)</span>
    <span class="sen">
Death is bad only if life is good. Death is bad. So life is
good.</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(2+)</span>
    <span class="sen">
No desire is voluntary. Some beliefs are desires. So some
beliefs are not voluntary.</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(3+)</span>
    <span class="sen">
Drasha is a cat. All cats are mysterious. So Drasha is
mysterious.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>

However, many or even most recent philosophical discussions of logical
consequence end up being discussions of logical truth. This is in part
because it is easier to think about sentences than about arguments,
and most issues about logical consequence can be translated into
analogous issues about logical truth. Thus, for example, on almost any
view, if an argument (with a finite number of premises) is a case of
logical consequence, then a material conditional whose antecedent is a
conjunction of the premises and whose consequent is the conclusion
will be a logical truth, and this truth will have the same modal force
and the same formal character as the inferential connection in its
corresponding argument. (Compare (1), (2) and (3) with (1+), (2+) and
(3+) respectively.) Although logical consequence is probably more
fundamental than logical truth in various important ways, this entry
follows the mentioned custom and discusses many issues relevant to
logical consequence in the guise of issues about logical truth. (See
 the entry on
 <a href="../logical-consequence/index.html">logical consequence</a>
 for a more direct discussion of this concept. See also Dummett 1981,
pp. 432 ff., and Wagner 1987, pp.  14 ff. for contrasting views on the
reasons why logical consequence is supposed to be more fundamental
than logical truth.)</p>

</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
  A terminological
warning. Sometimes the forms of logical truths, schemata such as
(1&prime;)&ndash;(3&prime;) or formalized correlates of them (see 2.1
below), are called &ldquo;logical truths&rdquo;. In what is perhaps
the most relaxed technical usage, the theoretical truths that are
asserted peculiarly by logic as a science, e.g. &ldquo;(1) is a
logical truth&rdquo;, are called &ldquo;logical truths&rdquo;. In what
is perhaps the most relaxed non-technical usage, all truths that are
more or less obvious are sometimes called &ldquo;logical
truths&rdquo;. Here we will use &ldquo;logical truth&rdquo; in the
strict technical sense paradigmatically illustrated by (1), (2) and
(3). In this strict sense only fully interpreted sentences are logical
truths (or just truths), and theoretical truths that are asserted
peculiarly by logic as a science need not be logical truths.  This
strict usage is also the most frequent philosophical usage.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>

This view should not be confused with another recent view, expressed
by Franks (2014), according to which there is no such thing as a
correct set of logical truths, not even in context (he calls this view
&ldquo;logical nihilism&rdquo;), and logic is concerned with studying,
by whatever means, all kinds of relations between propositions.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Strictly speaking, for Kant logic (general or pure logic) does not
give us logical truths in the customary sense we have been using,
which includes sentences involving empirical concepts. And in the case
of syllogisms, he deals with them as inferences, not as sentences. But
commentators have often considered the question of whether, say,
customary syllogisms, considered as sentences, would be analytic in
Kant's view. We will follow this common practice of abstracting from
some historical inaccuracies, when considering what Kant's view would
have been on the question of the epistemic ground of logical
truth.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Such an interpretation
would receive some support from the fact that for Kant, the logical
expressions do not express meanings in the way that non-logical
expressions express meanings or concepts (see <em>Critique of Pure
Reason</em>, B 186; several of the Kantian categories correspond
approximately to the &ldquo;significations&rdquo; of some paradigmatic
logical expressions; see also MacFarlane 2002). Logical expressions
might thus seem not to express meanings susceptible of analysis, and
if so analysis could not provide the grounds for thinking of a logical
truth as true. Leibniz's explicit view, on the other hand, had been
that the meanings of all expressions, including particles of all
kinds, were susceptible of analysis, and that all such analyses
constitute grounds for a priori demonstrations; see e.g. his
&ldquo;Analysis Linguarum&rdquo;, pp. 351&ndash;2. Bolzano would later
say that if all expressions have meanings susceptible of analysis,
many of these analyses would be synthetic in Kant's sense; see Bolzano
1837, &sect;305.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 We completely skip here a discussion of the question whether the
adequate representation of logical form can be given by means of
schemata at the level of surface syntax (what we have been more or
less assuming in our examples) or at some other level of logical or
linguistic representation postulated by philosophers or
linguists. Presumably the points we are about to make would apply
<em>mutatis mutandis</em> under any particular view of adequate
 representation of logical form. See the entry
 <a href="../logical-constants/index.html">logical constants</a> and 
the recent monograph Iacona (2018)
 for discussion bearing on this issue.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>

There are other approaches to the characterization of logical truth
for formalized languages that do not only use (or do not clearly only
use) concepts from standard mathematics. One classical approach, which
can be seen as a non-model-theoretic notion of validity (in the sense
of model-theoretic validity below), characterizes a logical truth
simply as a sentence such that all the sentences that are appropriate
replacement instances of the schematic letters in its logical form are
true. (If the class of replacement instances is not mathematically
well delimited, the notion of a replacement instance will not clearly
be characterizable in terms of standard mathematics.) While this
characterization may give the right results for some languages (see
section 2.3 below), it is widely thought that it is subject to severe
limitations (again mentioned in section 2.3 below). (See Dogramaci
2017 for a recent defense of this kind of characterization.)</p>

<p>
One recent approach to characterization that doesn't use only concepts
from standard mathematics is that of Field (2015). Field proposes to
leave &ldquo;logical truth&rdquo; as a primitive in the characterizing
theory, and to axiomatize it in terms of notions that include the
notion of belief and certain normative notions. The basic idea
reflected in the axioms is that a person is not permitted to accept a
sentence as logically true without fully believing it (or the
proposition it expresses) and the sentences that are appropriate
replacement instances of the schematic letters in its logical
form.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 The variables that appear in Fregean sentences (and in their logical
forms) are best seen as non-logical expressions, together with the
schematic letters. The meaning of the variables (their range) varies
from interpretation to interpretation of a Fregean language, as noted
below in the text.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Tarski's abstract method can be used, and is used, to give similar
characterizations of logical truth even for formalized languages which
extend Fregean languages. The mathematical notions of validity (and
derivability) that have been defined for these languages cannot be
discussed here. For discussion see, among others, the entries on
 <a href="../logic-conditionals/index.html">the logic of conditionals</a>,
 <a href="../logic-modal/index.html">modal logic</a>, and
 <a href="../logic-temporal/index.html">temporal logic</a>. 
Zalta (1988), Hanson (2006), Nelson and Zalta (2012) and 
Hanson (2014) contain discussion relevant to what we
will later call the problem of adequacy for some of these
languages. Etchemendy (2008) argues against his construal of the
Tarskian method noting that a model-theoretic definition of validity
based on the notion of a (classical) structure is obviously
extensionally inadequate for these languages; G&oacute;mez-Torrente
(2008) claims that Tarski's use of classical structures was intended
only for the characterization of logical truth for extensional
languages (though it may fail here for non-obvious reasons).</p>

<p>

Tarski's abstract method is also used by Beall and Restall (2000,
2006) to give the various characterizations of logical truth that on
their view (see section 1.1 in the main text) are compatible with the
pretheoretic concept of logical truth even for a given fixed Fregean
language.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Perhaps a qualification is necessary in view of the fact that
sentences like &ldquo;\(\exists x(x=x)\)&rdquo; are
usually interpreted as making categorical existence claims, but they
are model-theoretically valid. This is due to the usual convention of
not contemplating empty universe structures when defining
model-theoretic validity. But the method for defining validity can be
used and the corresponding (6)-type theorem proved for more inclusive
conventions (see the entry on
 <a href="../logic-free/index.html">free logic</a>).
 See Chihara 1998, &sect;5, for other possible qualifications.</p>

<h3><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
Part V of Nicolas Malebranche&rsquo;s most famous work, the voluminous
<em>Search after Truth</em> (1674&ndash;5) is devoted entirely to the
passions, while other parts treat different kinds of affective states,
such as the &ldquo;inclinations&rdquo;. Malebranche freely
acknowledges his debt to Descartes here and elsewhere, but his
treatment of the passions differs on at least two counts: first is the
emphasis on original sin and our fallen, corrupted nature, which shows
Malebranche&rsquo;s affinity with Augustine and the Augustinian revival
of the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Second is the rejection of the
Cartesian view granting priority to knowledge of our own mind.
Although we are capable of clear and distinct ideas through the
&ldquo;vision in God,&rdquo; Malebranche denies that direct experience
of our soul and its modifications provides such ideas. In this way, he
gives a very un-Cartesian twist to the Cartesian claim that the
passions of the soul (and similar perceptions) are confused. Less
important for our purposes is Malebranche&rsquo;s notorious
occasionalism, the view that genuine causal power belongs only to God.
We need simply to bear in mind that talk of &ldquo;natural
causes&rdquo; is shorthand for those states or events that are the
regular occasions for God to produce some effect. (For disussion of
these topics, see the related entry
 <a href="../malebranche/index.html">Malebranche</a>.)</p>
 
<h3><a name="ConStrPas">2. The Constitutive Structure of the Passions</a></h3>

<p>
The <em>Search After Truth</em> V.3 identifies seven moments that
together make up the structure of the passions. First is a
judgment-like perception of the relation an object has to us; this
perception may be either distinct or confused. Next comes a
determination of the impulse of the will. Although clearly related to
the first, the two cannot be identified, since Malebranche does not
seem to think that a rational perception alone can be motivating,
although the will responds to what appears a good. Along with the
perception and determination of the will, we also get an accompanying
sensation. The main thing that allows us to distinguish among passions
is this sensation, insofar as it is a sensation of, e.g., &ldquo;love,
aversion, desire, joy, or sadness&rdquo; (ST V.3, 348). Another
element is bodily, a new determination of the flow of the animal
spirits and blood. Following on the heels of these bodily changes is a
sensible &ldquo;emotion&rdquo; of the soul as it feels itself moved by
the unexpected flow of spirits. This, in turn, is followed by another
sensation, peculiar to the particular passion in question, caused by
the disturbances the animal spirits excite in the brain. Last is the
sensation of joy, or inner delight [<em>douceur
int&eacute;rieure</em>] that accompanies all the passions.</p>

<p>
Different passions may mobilize the elements of this structure
differently. For instance, Malebranche allows that passions may differ
because the first perceptions differ, even if the associated emotions
do not (although that difference in perception will produce
correlative changes in the third element, the sensation in the soul).
In the case of passions excited by confused sensations, the first
three elements (the evaluating perception, the inclination of the
will, and the accompanying sensation) may be missing. The imperfect
passion of wonder [<em>admiration</em>] lacks even more of the
elements typical of other passions. Despite concessions to such
truncated passions, the complicated and variable internal constitution
of the passions allows Malebranche to adopt a holistic account in
which the passions can be finely differentiated. However, the main
principle of taxonomy is the relation the passion supposes between the
object and us.</p>

<h3><a name="ClaPas">3. The Classification of the Passions</a></h3>

<p>
Malebranche&rsquo;s taxonomy in the <em>Search after Truth</em> does not
seem completely consistent, but in V.7, he declares that the two
parent passions are love and hatred &ndash; although he follows
Augustine in making love primary (see
 <a href="#FunPas">section 4 below</a>).
 These produce three &ldquo;general&rdquo; passions of desire, joy and
sadness, e.g., there can be desiderative love, joyful love and
melancholy love. But Malebranche also throws wonder into the mix,
calling it a passion that precedes all the others. He characterizes
wonder in ways reminiscent of Descartes: it involves no evaluative
perception of our relation to the object, and it doesn&rsquo;t dispose
the body towards action, since it produces no agitation in the nerves
leading to the heart. It can be useful to science, prompting us to
discover and learn new truths, although it can also malfunction.
Despite including all six of what Descartes considered the
&ldquo;primitive&rdquo; passions, the rest of Malebranche&rsquo;s
taxonomy differs a good deal from Descartes&rsquo;s, as can be seen in
the principles of classification offered in V.10. Love and hate may
produce different species modified by desire, joy and sadness, but
here Malebranche tells us that all passions can be reduced to the
three &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; passions of desire, joy and sadness,
combined with different judgments about the passions&rsquo; objects.
Some passions don&rsquo;t reduce to just one, but contain an emotion
mixed of almost equal parts of two or more of the primitive passions,
even mixtures of such seemingly opposed passions as joy and sadness.
Wonder too can be divided into various species of, e.g., esteem,
self-esteem, or pride, veneration, scorn, and humility.</p>

<h3><a name="FunPas">4. The Functions of the Passions</a></h3>

<p>
Malebranche follows Descartes in maintaining that the passions are
inherently functional for the union of mind and body, by teaching us
what will preserve the body. Passions are in us, Malebranche
maintains, because we have an essential relation to our bodies. The
natural cause of the passions is the body, more specifically, the
movement of animal spirits. The passions themselves are located in the
will (although as we have seen, they contain components of various
kinds). Thus, they are impulses or inclinations, comparable in some
respects to what Malebranche calls &ldquo;natural inclinations,&rdquo;
which are also affective and willful. But natural inclinations do not
have their (natural, occasional) causes in the body, and occur even in
pure intelligences, such as the angels. Natural inclinations are the
distinguishing &ldquo;motions&rdquo; proper to the mind alone, in
which God has imprinted a love of the good in general, which is simply
part of God&rsquo;s love for himself, and the source of all our
particular loves (see ST IV.1). That we have such inclinations is a
condition for our disposition to experience the passions: the passions
are confused and bodily-dependent traces of God&rsquo;s love. So
Malebranche takes love to be the primary impulse driving all the
passions. He does not, however, adopt the fully Augustinian position
of reducing all passions to love. Since sensible pain is a real evil,
and not simply a privation of good, there can be a genuine object of
aversion. But if we are not fleeing pain, then aversion does reduce to
love, to the pursuit of some good or other. More generally, our very
capacity to experience passions is explained by their function in
inclining us toward loving our bodies and all that might be useful for
their preservation. Malebranche extends this functional explanation
even to the natural causes of the passions: those movements &ldquo;of
the animal spirits that are dispersed throughout the body in order to
produce and maintain in it a disposition appropriate to the object we
perceive, so that the mind and body might be of mutual help in dealing
with it&rdquo; (ST V.1, 338). For this reason, the operation of the
passions, even of aversive passions such as sadness, is always
accompanied by a feeling of &ldquo;inner delight,&rdquo; a reflection
that the body is in the proper state vis-&agrave;-vis the object.</p>

<p>
Malebranche, however, takes the good that the passions serve to be a
limited good; it is a good only for the mind-body union, not one of
the goods for the soul alone (see Greenberg 2010). Moreover, the
corruption that is our lot after the Fall affects our experience of
the passions. Whereas Adam could feel the passions at will, we cannot.
Moreover, the inner delight we feel accompanying all the passions is
increased. And so, we typically find ourselves at the mercy of the
passions, and thereby torn from the greater good of God. This is
because we are not merely joined, but subjugated to our bodies &ndash;
and through our bodies, to our &ldquo;relatives, friends, city,
prince, country, clothes, house, land, horse, dog, to the entire
earth, the sun, the stars, to all the heavens&rdquo; (ST V. 2, 342).
Since union with God is the greatest of all goods, we should fight
against the influence of the passions, even against the love that
joins us more firmly to our bodies, and seek the separation required
to devote ourselves to the good of the mind. As Malebranche puts it,
the passions belong to &ldquo;the order of nature,&rdquo; and are
well-ordered only if considered in relation to the preservation of the
body. Even then, they may sometimes mislead us, although such cases
are fortunately rare (see ST V.1, 340). In this respect, Malebranche
differs somewhat from Descartes. His <em>Dialogues on Metaphysics and
on Religion</em> (1688) addresses the phantom pains that served
Descartes as exemplars of material falsity and thus a source of
relatively faultless error on our part. But Malebranche (through the
character Theodore) maintains that such error arises strictly from a
culpable misuse of natural reason (or rather, natural
&ldquo;revelation&rdquo;) (DMR 97). The difference is mostly a matter of
emphasis, but it is a telling one.</p>

<h3><a name="RolGraCorPas">5. The Role of Grace in Correcting the Passions</a></h3>

<p>
It is no easy task to overcome the influence of the passions in our
corrupted state. The passions do not obey our rational will, and the
inner delight that accompanies the operation of the passions makes for
genuine discomfort if we struggle against their promptings. Here
Malebranche&rsquo;s view of how the Fall corrupted a battery of natural
dispositions and inclinations that were inherently functional produces
multiple evaluations of the role of pleasures and pains. This is
reflected in his criticisms of previous theories of the emotions. The
Epicureans were at fault for identifying the good with sensible
pleasure (no matter how moderate and long-lasting that pleasure might
be). But neither does the Stoic ideal of <em>apatheia</em> offer a
satisfactory alternative, for it is simply implausible. Instead,
Malebranche holds <em>both</em> that we have a duty to struggle
against the delight that the passions afford in the name of a higher
good, <em>and</em> that &ldquo;there is no felicity without
pleasure&rdquo; (ST V.4, 361). Were all else equal, pleasure would be
good, and we simply cannot conceive of a happiness that does not
include pleasure and pleasurable affects. But all else is not equal.
The problem with the views of both Epicureans and Stoics &ndash; and
indeed even of such a nominally Christian author as Descartes &ndash;
is that they see no need for Grace to overcome the dysfunctional wages
of original sin. We can (and should) struggle against the passions,
but Grace is required to restore the balance of power within our
natures. It does so by providing us with a sensible delight in
following reason and in the intellectual love of God, which will
outweigh the discomfort of resisting the passions. Indeed, just as the
corruption wrought by original sin has perverted our dispositions to
pleasure to supercharge our bodily enjoyments, grace grants us new and
powerful pleasure in the love and union with God, a sensible
perception that God is our good (see ST V.4, 360, also Schmitter,
forthcoming).</p>

<h3><a name="PasErr">6. The Passions and Error</a></h3>

<p>
However, Malebranche&rsquo;s main topic in <em>The Search After
Truth</em> is not moral philosophy, but the methods for improving our
attempts to discover the truth. The passions are simply not suited to
pursuing this good; they tend to lead us into intellectual error, and
so it is important to correct their influence. Following Descartes,
Malebranche compares passions to sensations, and suggests that they
offer a comparable opportunity for error by tempting us to attribute
qualities belonging only to the subjective perceiving to the objects
of those perceptions. The kinds of qualities we project are quite
different in each case, but both involve projecting something peculiar
to the interaction of mind and object onto the object alone. The
passions also tempt us to errors of over-generalization: we may
over-generalize about the objects of our passions, as when my hate for
something makes me overlook even its good qualities; we may
over-generalize about the dispositions of other humans, as when I
assume that others tend to feel the same passions I do; and we may
over-generalize about objects related to the objects of our passions,
as when I groundlessly extend my dislike for some person to his
friends and relations. In describing these sorts of errors,
Malebranche adopts something of an associationist psychology, and his
analysis foreshadows Hume&rsquo;s analysis of prejudices. The passionate
stance taken toward one object spreads to whatever might be associated
in any number of ways with that thing. Unlike Hume, Malebranche does
not offer specific principles of association, but he does offer a
physiological explanation of the &ldquo;spread.&rdquo; Passions
invigorate the flow of animal spirits through the brain just as the
traces representing the object are called up. Because of their vigor,
the spirits are likely to overflow to nearby, related traces of
objects (association is here understood in terms of the proximity of
brain traces), which then come along for the recollective ride. And so
the &ldquo;dominant passions&rdquo; we feel will color our thinking
about a wide range of objects. Malebranche attributes all sorts of
theoretical errors, fashions, and factionalism (including what he
clearly considers an irrational preference for scholastic philosophy)
to the prejudices generated by such passionate overflow.</p>

<p>
The influence of the passions is not all bad. Wonder can be useful for
the sciences, just because of the vigor with which it stirs up the
various animal spirits, and thereby allows us to fix our attention and
retain things in memory. We may indeed need to call on the passion of
wonder as a strategy in the pursuit of science, for instance by
imagining something as novel (even more novel than it really is). But
wonder can also malfunction, producing not learning, but stupefaction.
Indeed, Malebranche takes the mistaken veneration felt for the ancient
philosophers to rest in no small part on the way artists are wont to
depict each as possessing &ldquo;a huge head with a broad and high
forehead and a magnificently full beard&rdquo; (ST V.7, 383). And
other passions that &ldquo;involve the heart&rdquo; more, and thereby
dispose the body for action, can be yet more prejudicial to our
interests. In particular, Malebranche declares that hatred and dread
are the passions most damaging both to our reason and to civil
society.</p>

<p>
Malebranche insists time and time again that &ldquo;all the passions
seek their own justification&rdquo; (ST V.11, 399). That is, they tend
to maintain themselves through a kind of feedback loop that includes
the production of judgments that accord with the passion and sustain
it: cheerful passions will produce judgments that all is right in the
world, whereas dread encourages judgments with the opposite character.
Because they offer an alternative source for judgments, the passions
can compete with our intellect and override its verdicts. Moreover,
the passions draw support from other passions; they &ldquo;cooperate
among themselves,&rdquo; producing self-sustaining complexes and
trains of passion:</p>

<blockquote>
desire is animated by love, strengthened by hope, increased by joy,
renewed by dread, accompanied by courage, envy, anger, and several
other passions that in turn form an infinite variety of judgments that
succeed one another and sustain the desire giving birth to them. (ST
V.11, 402)
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="InfImaPas">7. The Influence of the Imagination on the Passions</a></h3>

<p>
The support the passions afford each other is largely a matter of the
relations among the perceptions and judgments generated by each
passion, which can overwhelm the few resources available to the
intellect to combat them. For this reason, intervening in the
formation of those judgments can undermine the self-seeking
justifications of the passions. Although he is not sanguine about our
chances, Malebranche recommends that our best strategy is to recruit
allies for the intellect, particularly by enlisting the imagination.
Chapter V.8 describes how the passions stir up the animal spirits and
leave brain traces that are not under the soul&rsquo;s command,so that
&ldquo; the passions, then, act on the imagination, and the
imagination thus corrupted combats reason by continually representing
things to it not as they are in themselves&rdquo; (ST V.11, 402). But
the imagination itself stands &ndash; to some extent &ndash; under the
control of the mind, and is, in fact, &ldquo;the only means the soul
has of arresting the effects of its passions&rdquo; (ST V.3, 351). The
imagination is a bodily faculty, with physiological connections to the
opening and contracting of the nerves that determine the flow of
spirits and humors. That is a connection we can use and modify, for
instance, by forming imaginative pictures to accompany various
thoughts, including abstract thoughts. Now, even purely abstract
thoughts may produce &ldquo;inclinations in the soul,&rdquo; e.g.,
thinking of truth, virtue, or God can produce an inclination of love.
And inclinations of the soul (even those not directly related to the
body) have bodily effects; in particular, they produce disturbances in
the animal spirits. The imagination, however, adds a strong extra
impetus to those effects. Actively deploying the imagination, then,
can generate the entire train of sensations and emotions typical of
that passion we deem appropriate, namely the passion in accord with
the soul&rsquo;s natural inclinations. We can also resist the pernicious
influences of the imagination caused by recalcitrant passions through
techniques of association. Training ourselves to associate some
thought with whatever arouses our passion, we can redirect the
accompanying bodily movements as we see fit. Doing so repeatedly
produces a habituation that changes our dispositions for actions and
passions. None of these tricks obviate the need for Grace, but they
are useful stopgap measures.</p>

<h3><a name="SocChaPas">8. The Social Character of the Passions</a></h3>

<p>
Just as the passions exhibit and produce dependence on the body, so
too do they exhibit and produce social relations and interdependence
on others. For the train of the passions does not stop at the limits
of an individual body, but is communicated between individuals. A
passion in one individual will produce facial expressions and other
sensible bodily effects &ndash; bearing, changes of color, words,
cries, and the like. Perceiving these outer symptoms of the passions
powerfully affects the imagination of other humans (and animals), and
thence rouses their passions. The communication of passions across
populations is a crucial bit of glue holding civil society together.
But it can also threaten social order.</p>

<p>
Malebranche adopts the same attitude towards communications of the
passions that he showed towards the passions individually: they are
basically functional. For one, he takes it that the passions so
reproduced are usually sociable: &ldquo;passions that move us mainly
in order to link us to all sensible things for the preservation of
society and of our sensible being&rdquo; (ST V.7, 377). In particular,
expressions of distress produce passions in others that disturb and
interest them in the person&rsquo;s preservation (ST V.3, 348&ndash;9). Even
wonder can serve a social purpose: Malebranche interprets the behavior
of small dogs in the presence of a larger dog as expressions of wonder
that work toward their self-preservation. Malebranche also assumes
that the passions produce like passions in others &ndash; that their
communication is a communication of like to like. (This is a point
made frequently in ancient rhetoric). As such, the communication of
passions serves to join &ldquo;men together in relation to good and
evil and [make] them exactly like one another not only in their mental
disposition but also in the condition of their body&rdquo; (ST V.7,
377). But although it usually greases the wheels of human interaction,
the social communication of passions can also exacerbate their
detrimental aspects, e.g., by allowing the passion-induced errors of
one person to be replicated across an entire population.</p>

<p>
However, the communication and liability to passions is not completely
uniform. Malebranche suggests that the disposition to feel various
passions will vary across differences in &ldquo;sexes and ages,&rdquo;
as well as characters, &ldquo;occupations and stations in life.&rdquo;
The reasons for this variation are both physiological and
social-psychological. Malebranche holds that people of different ages,
sexes, and temperaments (e.g., melancholics) will show differences in
the &ldquo;construction of the brain&rsquo;s fibers as well as the
agitation and amount of spirits and blood.&rdquo; Differences in such
construction will clearly alter which passions one will feel, and what
the effects of a passion will be. But so too do the associations we
form affect the dispositions to feel passions towards certain things.
These associations are psychological, but are shaped by social
position. Thus, &ldquo;great men&rdquo; depend on more things than
other people do, and their slavery is of greater extent (see James
2005, and for a contrast, Schmitter 2012). In contrast, women are
likely to be involved only with family and neighborhood, and so
won&rsquo;t be as liable to passions directed at an entire nation. But
the passions they do feel may be stronger, just because of their
narrow scope.</p>

<h3><a name="PasCauCon">9. Passions, Causation and Consciousness</a></h3>

<p>
Malebranche emphasizes that the communication of passions takes place
through purely mechanical means. Each step is mechanical, starting
with how a passion produces bodily expressions. Fear may make our
faces blanch, our hearts race, and our knees knock together, but these
are simply the effects of the movements of the blood and animal
spirits that are part of the passion. So too may the perception of
these expressions strike the imagination and initiate a series of
bodily changes in the observer, culminating in some passion. But again
these effects are just the result of the design of the machine.
Malebranche takes it that this explains why we may be completely
unaware of many or most of these effects, even as they occur within
us.</p>

<p>
In general, Malebranche denies that the experience of the passions (or
indeed of any perceptions) is transparent to itself: &ldquo;not all
our passions are accompanied by some awareness on the mind&rsquo;s part
&hellip; we often feel moved by some passion without knowing it and
sometimes even without feeling its cause&rdquo; (ST V.12, 407).
Malebranche here seems most struck by the possibility that we do not
know the cause of our passions &ndash; a point familiar from
Descartes. But he also acknowledges that we may feel a passion without
knowing what it is; even an occurrent passion may be &lsquo;an
I-know-not-what moves me.&rsquo; Passions seem most likely to be
opaque when we feel them unreflectively, through mere association.
Malebranche takes such association to operate as does the mechanical
causation found in bodily events, especially where there are
&ldquo;secret alliances with the present disposition of our
body&rdquo; (ST V.12, 407). In this way, he links a lack of full
accessibility to consciousness with mechanical causation in an
associationist psychology.</p>

<h3><a name="InfLatAut">10. Influences on Later Authors</a></h3>

<p>
Although now somewhat overshadowed by other seventeenth-century
continental philosophers, Malebranche&rsquo;s influence on early modern
thought was enormous. This is particularly the case in British
philosophy, which saw an important group of English Malebrancheans
arise in the late seventeenth century, most notably John Norris (see
Norris, 1688), while the British Empiricists used him as their
favorite exemplar of a &ldquo;rationalist.&rdquo; Nowhere is the
extent of Malebranche&rsquo;s influence more obvious than in his
treatment of the passions: not only did his general
proto-associationist and imagination-based psychology and its
extension to the social communication of affects shape the thought of
several generations of eighteenth century British philosophers, but
his particular accounts of the passion of love, and even of why we
take pleasure in tragic drama were adopted almost wholesale by several
authors (Norris and Astell, 1695, and cf. Masham, 1696), with Norris
giving a throughly hedonist interpretation to Malebranche&rsquo;s
account of pleasure. Similar associationist views can also be found in
such contemporaries as Spinoza and Pascal. But Malebranche seems the
main conduit through which these thoughts were received by British
philosophers, making him a force to be reckoned with in understanding
the origins of 18th century British empiricist psychology and moral
philosophy. Hutcheson explicitly identifies Malebranche as the source
for the distinction between violent passions and calm affections, and
although neither Hume, nor Smith are so overt, their notions of
sympathy and affective dynamics are clearly indebted to
Malebranche.</p>

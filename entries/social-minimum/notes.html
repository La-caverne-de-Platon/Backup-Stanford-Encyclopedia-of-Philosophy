 Doyal and Gough argue that human beings have &ldquo;basic
needs&rdquo; for physical health and &ldquo;autonomy&rdquo;, which
they define as &ldquo;the ability to make informed choices about what
should be done and how to go about doing it&rdquo; (Doyal and Gough
1991: 53). From these two basic needs, they then derive a range of
&ldquo;intermediate needs&rdquo; for various goods that seem essential
to the satisfaction of the basic needs. However, the notion of
autonomy is employed in two senses in their analysis. The first type
of autonomy consists in the ability of the individual to draw on her
culture to formulate and choose personal goals and then to pursue
these goals in a rational way. The second type, which Doyal and Gough
term &ldquo;critical autonomy&rdquo;, involves an ability to critique
and move beyond the culture that the individual inherits (see Doyal
and Gough 1991: 67&ndash;69, 187&ndash;190). The latter notion of
autonomy is much stronger than the first, and is certainly not
endorsed, even implicitly, in all societal cultures or by proponents
of all ethical doctrines. For many religious communities, for example,
critical autonomy might look like a threat to the good life, not a
basic human need. For an argument that the Doyal-Gough account of
basic needs (nevertheless) offers a more ecumenical approach to the
specification of social minima than Nussbaum&rsquo;s approach, see Gough
(2003).</p>

 Not all libertarians would agree with this. Sterba (1998) provides a
helpful overview. Note that within Nozick&rsquo;s framework, one might also
conceivably defend the establishment of a social minimum policy regime
as an imperfect, second-best form of &ldquo;rectification&rdquo; for
historical injustices. The existing distribution of private property
in contemporary societies has been shaped by terrible historical
rights violations such as slavery and theft of land. It can be argued
that the victims of such historical rights violations are entitled to
some kind of compensation for these violations and/or their knock-on
effects. However, where the historical injustices are long in the
past, and the pattern of resulting harm and unjust advantage is now
hard to discern, it can be hard to tailor rectification in a precise
fashion. Rather than making no effort at rectification at all, a
libertarian might possibly argue that a society that has experienced
these injustices should enact a social minimum, at least as a
temporary measure, so as to ensure that nobody is very badly off as a
result of past rights violations. See Nozick 1974: 152&ndash;153,
230&ndash;231.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Not all left-libertarians propose a strictly equal division of the
relevant external resources. Philippe Van Parijs proposes a
&ldquo;maximin&rdquo; division, one that maximizes the amount of the
relevant assets/asset value held by those with the lowest share of
these assets/asset values. Michael Otsuka proposes a distribution that
equalises opportunity for welfare, a proposal that might require
giving a higher share of external resources to those with low earnings
power or health conditions. See Van Parijs 1995, Otsuka 2003.</p>

 Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott 1999, present the case for capital
grant of this kind, though they do not propose that it should entirely
replace conventional welfare programs. Van Parijs defends, on
paternalistic grounds, a periodic income grant over a capital grant
(see Van Parijs 1995: chapter 2).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Strictly speaking, the difference principle applies to an index of
&ldquo;social primary goods&rdquo; that includes not only income and
wealth but a range of other primary goods including the &ldquo;social
bases of self-respect&rdquo; and leisure-time. See Rawls 1999 [1971]:
478&ndash;479, 2001: 60, 179.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 This argument can also be made within the framework of Rawls&rsquo;s theory
of justice as briefly outlined in section 2.4.1 above. Rawls&rsquo;s first
principle of justice requires that citizens enjoy a scheme of adequate
basic liberties, which liberties include the political liberties of
competing for elected office and exercising the vote. Rawls argues
that justice not only requires that citizens enjoy these liberties but
that the political liberties have what he terms &ldquo;fair
value&rdquo;. Following the reasoning set out above in the main text,
it can be argued that maintaining the fair value of the political
liberties requires the enactment of a social minimum (though Rawls
himself regards such an argument as superfluous in view of the fact
that, in his view, the enactment of a social minimum is independently
implied by the difference principle). See Rawls 1993: 327&ndash;329,
1999 [1971]: 198&ndash;199.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 The distinction between negative and positive conceptions of liberty
is made by Isaiah Berlin in his essay &ldquo;Two Concepts of
Liberty&rdquo; (Berlin 1969 [1958]). However, the language of positive
liberty goes further back at least as far as T.H. Green&rsquo;s influential
essay, &ldquo;Liberal Legislation and Freedom of Contract&rdquo;
delivered as a lecture in 1881 (see Miller 1991: 21&ndash;32).
Moreover, the distinction that Berlin makes in his essay is not the
same as the distinction made in the main text above. Berlin&rsquo;s
conception of &ldquo;positive liberty&rdquo; is closely related to an
Idealist conception of freedom as rational self-mastery, a conception
that is not necessarily implied by the way I have used the term
&ldquo;positive liberty&rdquo; above.</p>
</div>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 It may be a concern of this kind that has lead some philosophers
sympathetic to left-libertarianism to explore ways in which we might
extend the scope of the left-libertarian argument beyond what we
conventionally think of as inherited resources to cover other kinds of
assets. Philippe Van Parijs, for example, argues that citizens of a
society have a right to an equal (or maximin) share of their society&rsquo;s
&ldquo;job assets&rdquo; exactly like the right to external assets
such as land. Van Parijs argues that we can impute a monetary value to
job assets (given by the employment rents attached to jobs) and that
we should add the implied sum to the fund from which we pay an
unconditional stipend. If we do this, then, in the circumstances of
some countries today, the unconditional stipend could well be
sufficient to cover most basic needs, perhaps even more than
sufficient (see Van Parijs 1995: chapter 4). Whether the traditional
left-libertarian argument can be extended convincingly in this way is,
however, a matter of controversy. For discussion of Van Parijs&rsquo;s
argument, see Reeve and Williams (2003). For a general critical
discussion of left-libertarianism see also Fried 2004.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 What if a significant section of society stands outside of a broad
consensus supporting a Nussbaum-style list of central capabilities? In
such a case we might face a conflict between justice and legitimacy.
Justice might require that we enact a social minimum in line with the
reasonable conception of human capabilities provided by the list, but
the just policy will lack legitimacy for some of the citizens who are
bound by the policy of enactment. How such conflicts are most
appropriately resolved is a very important question, but one that I do
not have space to consider here.</p>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Means-testing refers to the policy of making eligibility for a
welfare benefit depend on how much income and/or wealth the individual
or household has; eligibility is restricted to those at or below a
specified threshold of income and/or wealth, and the benefit is
withdrawn as income and/or wealth increase. The main argument for
means-testing is that it targets scarce public funds directly to those
most in need. Worries about means-testing include the following: that
it creates disincentives for individuals to increase their
income/wealth through their own efforts (why bother if the government
will cut the benefits it pays you by a near-equivalent amount?); that
it stigmatizes the poor as recipients of special assistance, something
that is bad in itself and that might lead to low take-up of the
benefits so that the poor actually do not receive them; and that by
limiting participation in welfare to the poor it renders welfare
programs politically vulnerable to cost-cutting. For all these
reasons, critics argue that means-testing might not be in the
long-term interests of the most needy. For a helpful discussion,
critical of means-tested welfare states, see Rothstein (1998).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 A benefit is provided &ldquo;in-kind&rdquo; when the government
provides the individual directly with a good or service that he or she
needs, or gives the individual a voucher that can be used only to
purchase a specified good or service. In-kind benefits are criticized
on the grounds that people will typically derive more immediate,
subjective welfare if they are given a cash sum equal to the cost of
the in-kind benefit and allowed to spend this sum as they like.
Supporters of in-kind provision reply that in-kind provision better
protects the interests of dependents, such as children; and that in
some cases cash provision misses the moral point of the transfer,
which is not to generate subjective welfare, but to secure a specific
capability. For general discussion, see Thurow (1976); and on the
latter point, see also Miller 2000: 211&ndash;212.</p>

 Important contributions here include Beitz (1979 [1999]), Shue (1980), Caney
(2005), Ypi (2011), Ip (2016), and Laborde and Ronzoni (2016). Shue
argues that universal &ldquo;basic rights&rdquo; include a right to
subsistence and that citizens of one country have a responsibility to
act to secure this right for citizens of another country provided that
their own &ldquo;vital interests&rdquo; are not jeopardized. Charles
Beitz presents an argument that Rawls&rsquo;s conception of justice should
apply transnationally. Given our argument that Rawls&rsquo;s theory supports
institution of a social minimum, this arguably entails a transnational
social minimum. Simon Caney argues that egalitarian principles, such
as equality of opportunity, apply globally, and one might argue that
this supports enacting a global social minimum (for example, because
this is necessary to secure equality of opportunity). Lea Ypi argues
that since absolute deprivation has as one major cause the inequality
of power between states, a concern to enact a global minimum will
naturally require us also to address inequality between states. Ka-Wai
Ip argues that relational egalitarian principles apply globally. This
might also provide theoretical resources to support enactment of a
global social minimum. Similarly, Cecile Laborde and Miriam Ronzoni
argue that the individual&rsquo;s interest in freedom as &lsquo;non-domination&rsquo;
establishes an interest in their state not being dominated by other
states. We can argue that this supports economic arrangements at the
global level to prevent states becoming so poor that they are at risk
of domination by other states. Also relevant here is the literature on
global freedom of movement, since freedom of movement could work to
reduce risks of global poverty. For relevant discussions see Carens
(2015) and Oberman (2015).</p>

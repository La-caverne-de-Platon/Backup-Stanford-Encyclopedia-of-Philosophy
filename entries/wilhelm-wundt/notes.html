<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt</a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1" id="note-1">1.</a>
 William James saw an inverse ratio between Wundt&rsquo;s productivity
and wisdom: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
He aims at being a Napoleon of the intellectual world. Unfortunately
he will never have a Waterloo, for he is Napoleon without genius and
with no central idea&hellip;. </p>

<p>
Whilst they make mincemeat of some of his views by their criticisms,
he is meanwhile writing a book on an entirely different subject. Cut
him up like a worm, and each fragment crawls; there is no <em>noeud
vital</em> in his mental medulla oblongata, so that you can&rsquo;t
kill him all at once. 
(Letter to Carl Stumpf, 6 Feb. 1887 in James 1920: 263; 
Quoted in Perry 1935: 68; cited in Boring 1950: 346)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2" id="note-2">2.</a>
 The most complete bibliography of Wundt&rsquo;s works is by his
daughter, Eleonore (E. Wundt 1927), reprinted in Rieber and Robinson
2001. All translations of Wundt&rsquo;s writings in this article are
by the author.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3" id="note-3">3.</a>
 Cf. Boring for a more nuanced account of Wundt&rsquo;s revisions of
his system (e.g., Boring 1950: 326).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4" id="note-4">4.</a>
 See, for example, the numerous recent articles on Wundt in
<em>History of Psychology</em> and <em>History of Behavioral
Psychology</em>. According to the current consensus, the once-dominant
representations of his work by E.B. Titchener and Titchener&rsquo;s
student, E.G. Boring, have been discredited as one-sided or
insufficiently informed by Wundt&rsquo;s own writings (see, e.g.,
Blumenthal 1979). Cf. Kusch 1995: 249.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5" id="note-5">5.</a>
 Boring calls this text &ldquo;the most important book in the history
of modern psychology&rdquo; (Boring 1950: 322).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6" id="note-6">6.</a>
 For an excellent overview of Helmholtz&rsquo;s work, see Boring 1950:
297&ndash;315. For Wundt&rsquo;s relation to Helmholtz, see Wundt
1920: 155&ndash;169.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7" id="note-7">7.</a>
 Boring 1950: 323&ndash;4. In fact, William James had established a
psychological &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; at Harvard in 1875 (Ben-David
and Collins 1966: 455). By 1890, Boring writes, Wundt &ldquo;had
proved that [a psychological laboratory] could be productive. The
researches were increasing and the facts were piling up&rdquo; (Boring
1950: 325).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8" id="note-8">8.</a>
 Notably from the U.S.: the &ldquo;majority of the first generation of
experimentalists in America&rdquo; studied with Wundt: G. Stanley
Hall, J.M. Cattell (an expert inventor of apparatus), E.W. Scripture,
Frank Angell, E.B. Titchener, G.M. Stratton, and C.H. Judd.
Wundt&rsquo;s student, Hugo M&uuml;nsterberg, became the first
director of the psychological laboratory founded at Harvard by William
James (Thompson and Robinson 1979: 425). For more detail on the
influence of German academic psychology on the establishment of the
field in the United States, see especially Ben-David and Collins 1966:
457, ff.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9" id="note-9">9.</a>
 Sluga 1993: 7, 112. Sluga writes that Max was in his &ldquo;rabidly
nationalist and racist ideas [and] &hellip; conservative and even
reactionary social policies&rdquo; &ldquo;far to the right of his
father&rdquo;.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10" id="note-10">10.</a>
 Still, as Sluga reminds us, &ldquo;Wundt nevertheless continued to
counsel moderation and completely rejected the goals of German
annexationists&rdquo; (Sluga 1993: 105).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11" id="note-11">11.</a>
 See Kusch 1995: 193, ff., on his intervention against the &ldquo;pure
philosophers&rsquo;&rdquo; petition.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12" id="note-12">12.</a>
 Of course, as Wundt points out, there are limits or thresholds below
which we cannot sense, and above which the sensory apparatus itself
breaks down. Weber&rsquo;s ratio holds true anywhere within those
limits.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13" id="note-13">13.</a>
 There is some confusion as to what precisely <em>is</em>
&ldquo;Weber&rsquo;s Law&rdquo;. As Boring writes, Weber himself never
formulated a &ldquo;law&rdquo;, but merely reported, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
that the smallest perceptible difference between two weights can be
stated as a ratio between the weights, &hellip;independent of the
magnitudes of the weights. (Boring 1950: 113) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It was <em>Fechner</em> who later named this relation
&ldquo;Weber&rsquo;s Law&rdquo;, except that Fechner used it to name a
<em>different</em> equation from 

 \[
\Delta I/I=k
 \]

 namely one resulting from
several permutations of his own <em>Fundamentalformel</em>&mdash;a
generalization of 

 \[
\Delta I/I=k
 \]

 As Boring points out, the name
&ldquo;Weber&rsquo;s Law&rdquo; should be reserved for this simple
formula (Boring 1950: 287).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14" id="note-14">14.</a>
 Cf. esp. Ben-David and Collins 1966: 463; Hall 1912: 326. Wundt often
describes this triangulatory development by contrasting the
physiological, the psychophysical, and the psychological (e.g.,
<em>L</em> III: 164, ff.).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15" id="note-15">15.</a>
 &ldquo;All experimental methods of psychology appeal to physiology
for support, since they can never ignore the physiological stimuli
[<em>Einwirkungen</em>] upon the organism or its physiological
reactions&rdquo; (<em>L</em> III: 219). Yet Kusch quotes Wundt:
&ldquo;Experimental psychology [can]not be equated with
physiology&rdquo; (Kusch 1995: 154; Kusch cites Wundt 1920: 314). The
context is unclear; Wundt generally does identify the two.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16" id="note-16">16.</a>
 By &ldquo;immediate phenomena&rdquo;, Wundt means such as &ldquo;do
not require mediation through external processes&rdquo; (<em>L</em> I:
6).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17" id="note-17">17.</a>
 This is not to suggest that Wundt does not have a notion of
&ldquo;<em>Seele</em>&rdquo;: yet he sees it as merely one
side&mdash;the &ldquo;inner perspective&rdquo;&mdash;of one and the
same unity whose &ldquo;outer perspective&rdquo; is the body
(<em>Leib</em>) (<em>PP</em> II: 648).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18" id="note-18">18.</a>
 But conscious phenomena also include what Wundt calls the
&ldquo;products of consciousness&rdquo;, i.e., external cultural
artifacts such as language, myth, and custom. These latter form the
theme of what Wundt calls <em>V&ouml;lkerpsychologie</em>, or
&ldquo;social psychology&rdquo;, and are discussed in Section V. In
this division of mental (<em>geistig</em>) phenomena, Wundt seems to
follow the Hegelian opposition of subjective <em>Geist</em> and its
&ldquo;objectifications&rdquo; (cf. Ringer 1969: 300).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19" id="note-19">19.</a>
 Wundt goes on to list several other ways in which what we might call
the &ldquo;autoimmunity&rdquo; of our mental representations can
remain untainted: focusing on memories, rather than the phenomena
themselves, and excluding from inquiry involuntary and obscure
processes from study (<em>L</em> III: 162&ndash;3).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20" id="note-20">20.</a>
 Wundt&rsquo;s conception of self-observation is not always
consistent. Whereas he generally understands it to be a method of
focused attention, when it comes to observing the associative
processes prior to the activity of apperception (see below), he says
that it &ldquo;is necessary to suppress as much as possible the
activity of will, and passively give oneself over to the play of the
emerging representations&rdquo; (<em>PP</em> II: 437).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21" id="note-21">21.</a>
 The best source for these is Wundt&rsquo;s <em>PP</em>. Many accounts
of the experiments and apparatus used are also available in the issues
of Wundt&rsquo;s journal, <em>Philosophische Studien</em>; in Hearst
1979a; in Rieber 1980; and in Rieber and Robinson 2001.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22" id="note-22">22.</a>
 Hearst is somewhat misleading when he writes that
&ldquo;psychology&rsquo;s central interest <em>since</em> Wundtian
times&rdquo; was the &ldquo;study of sensory processes;&rdquo; this
study had been almost the exclusive topic of scientific psychological
research for most of the nineteenth century (Hearst 1979b: 29 [italics
added]; cf. Littman 1979: 39&ndash;40). Boring writes: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Goethe, Purkinje, Johannes M&uuml;ller, E.H. Weber, and later Fechner,
A.W. Volkmann and Helmholtz, all worked out the laws of their own
experiences as they were consequent upon stimulation, and the last
named five carefully controlled the stimulation. Newton long before
had discovered the laws of color mixture in the same way. (Boring
1950: 80)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23" id="note-23">23.</a>
 &ldquo;Wundt distinguished between &lsquo;physical&rsquo; and
&lsquo;mental causality&rsquo;, and claimed that &lsquo;no connection
of physical processes can ever teach us anything about the manner of
connection between psychological elements&rsquo; (Wundt 1894:
43)&rdquo; (Kusch 1995: 134).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24" id="note-24">24.</a>
 This kind of perspectivism, which is here expressed as a kind of
&ldquo;double-aspect&rdquo; approach to the mind-body dichotomy,
pervades Wundt&rsquo;s thinking. Philosophy and the sciences more
generally, he holds, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
have essentially the same content, suggesting that it [is] merely the
<em>viewpoint</em> from which this content [is] studied that
distinguish[es] the two realms of knowledge. (Kusch 1995: 129) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Lastly, a perspectivism is evident in one aspect of Wundt&rsquo;s
so-called voluntarism, viz., the view that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
different mental processes, like representing, feeling and wanting,
were always mere aspects of a unitary event, and they were all equally
basic; i.e., none could be derived directly from the other. (Kusch
1995: 136)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25" id="note-25">25.</a>
 Cf. esp. <em>PP</em> II: 256. I say &ldquo;sensations&rdquo; rather
than &ldquo;sensation&rdquo;, so as to avoid the possible
misunderstanding that Wundt means we have a &ldquo;faculty&rdquo; or
&ldquo;power&rdquo; of sensation.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26" id="note-26">26.</a>
 Visual and tactile sensation-compounds moreover display a fourth
feature of &ldquo;spatiality&rdquo; (<em>r&auml;umliche
Beschaffenheit</em>) (<em>PP</em> I: 282).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27" id="note-27">27.</a>
 They are more perspicuously expressed as 

\[
K=C(\Delta S/S)
\]

 where \(\Delta
S\) is the stimulus-increase necessary to be added to a given stimulus
\(S\) in order to effect a just noticeable difference in
sensation, \(k\), and \(C\) is a constant magnitude. This
formula, given by Wundt, differs from the formula commonly given
today: 

\[
\Delta I/I=k
\]

 where \(\Delta I\) represents the difference
threshold, \(I\) represents the initial stimulus intensity, and
\(k\) signifies that the proportion on the left side of the
equation remains constant, whatever the value of \(I\) (within a
given range).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28" id="note-28">28.</a>
 &ldquo;&hellip;eigenth&uuml;mliche Erregungsgesetze der
Nervensubstanz&hellip;&rdquo; (<em>PP</em> I: 390).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29" id="note-29">29.</a>
 &ldquo;[P]sychology is an empirical science <em>co-ordinated</em>
with natural science, and the perspectives of both complement each
other in such a way that only together do they exhaust the empirical
knowledge open to us&rdquo; (Wundt 1896b: 12, quoted in Kusch 1995:
133).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30" id="note-30">30.</a>
 Wundt often uses the substantive, &ldquo;<em>Geschehen</em>&rdquo;,
which does not admit of easy English translation. As a verb,
&ldquo;<em>geschehen</em>&rdquo;, it means &ldquo;to happen&rdquo; or
&ldquo;to occur&rdquo;, but &ldquo;<em>Geschehen</em>&rdquo; does not
mean &ldquo;a happening&rdquo; or &ldquo;an occurrence&rdquo; (apt
translations for the German &ldquo;<em>Geschehnis</em>&rdquo;). The
closest one could come with a single word would be the gerundive
forms, &ldquo;happening&rdquo; or &ldquo;occurring&rdquo;, where these
are understood to mean a process continuing over time. To more clearly
render this continuing sense, I will use a phrase like &ldquo;flow of
events&rdquo;.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31" id="note-31">31.</a>
 Cf. <em>PP</em> II: 256.
Wundt reserves the term, representation, for compounds of sensations,
and does not consider sensations themselves to be representations (cf.
<em>PP</em> II: 3, nn. 1, 2).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-32" id="note-32">32.</a>
 This in turn can be either a &ldquo;memory-picture
[<em>Erinnerungsbild</em>]&rdquo; or &ldquo;imaginary representation
[<em>Einbildungsvorstellung</em>]&rdquo;. <em>PP</em> II:
1&ndash;2.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-33" id="note-33">33.</a>
 These &ldquo;facts&rdquo; include the many analyses contained in the
first 250 pages of <em>PP</em> II, on auditory, visual, and tactile
representations and the rules of their &ldquo;fusion&rdquo;
(<em>Verschmelzung</em>).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-34" id="note-34">34.</a>
 Wundt&rsquo;s choice of &ldquo;apperception&rdquo; must be compared
with both Kant&rsquo;s and Herbart&rsquo;s very different uses of the
term. Cf., e.g., Boring 1950: 256&ndash;7.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-35" id="note-35">35.</a>
 Even &ldquo;passive&rdquo; apperception, which, as Wundt writes, is
not a generic difference but merely one of <em>degree</em> of activity
(<em>PP</em> II: 277); passive apperception is akin to instinctive or
unreflective willing, while active apperception is like the arbitrary
action of the will (<em>Willk&uuml;rhandlung</em>) (<em>PP</em> II:
278, 562).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-36" id="note-36">36.</a>
 <em>L</em> III: 145, 156, ff. Wundt strictly distinguishes his
&ldquo;psychological&rdquo; voluntarism, which he believes is simply
an expression of a phenomenological fact, from the
&ldquo;metaphysical&rdquo; voluntarism promoted, say, by Schopenhauer
(Wundt 1911a: 158).</p>

 Through, e.g., the associative functions of &ldquo;assimilation,
complication, and successive association&rdquo; (<em>PP</em> II:
475&ndash;6). &ldquo;Fusion&rdquo; and &ldquo;complication&rdquo; are
again terms Wundt borrows from Herbart (cf. Boring 1950: 258).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-38" id="note-38">38.</a>
 On Wundt on association and apperception, see <em>PP</em> II: 437,
ff.; Eisler 1902: 51&ndash;8; K&ouml;nig 1901: 103&ndash;7,
120&ndash;7, 156&ndash;60 (Boring 1950: 345&ndash;6).</p>

 &ldquo;The phenomena in which this psychic process clearly appears
are compound words. Every compound word indicates this psychological
process [of agglutination], every word, that is, in which the combined
word-units have still maintained independent meanings of which we
remain conscious&rdquo; (<em>L</em> I: 39).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-40" id="note-40">40.</a>
 Nevertheless, Wundt resists collapsing will and consciousness. He
writes: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[N]o matter how much the will and the representational contents of
consciousness mutually condition each other, we will nevertheless be
forced by that developmental process to assign both a different
meaning. In the will, the subject immediately grasps its own inner
action [<em>Handlung</em>]; in the representational contents, [by
contrast,] a reality distinct from the subject is reflected. Yet the
relations that obtain between these two express themselves in feelings
and emotions [<em>Gef&uuml;hle und Gem&uuml;thsbewegungen</em>].
(<em>PP</em> II: 565)</p>
</blockquote>

 Cf. Boring 1950: 321; but cf. 331; Thompson and Robinson 1979:
412&ndash;3. One reason for this confusion may have to do with
Wundt&rsquo;s evolution. Natorp, e.g., summarizes Wundt&rsquo;s
apparent development from a psychophysical dualism to a monism
beginning with his 1873&ndash;4, which he compares with
Wundt&rsquo;s <em>Grundri&szlig; der Psychologie</em> (1896a). The
position represented in the latter corresponds, according to Natorp,
to Wundt&rsquo;s later writings more generally, including the later
editions of his 1874, as well as his
<em>Logik</em>. The dualism expressed in the 1874 version of
<em>PP</em> is not expressed as an opposition between mind and body,
but as between &ldquo;inner&rdquo; and &ldquo;outer&rdquo; perception.
In his 1896a, Wundt argues that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the definition of psychology as &lsquo;science of inner
experience&rsquo; is inadequate because it could awaken the
misunderstanding that inner and outer experience have completely
different objects, despite the fact that there is not a single natural
phenomenon that is not at the same time, as a [mental] representation,
an object of psychology. (Natorp 1912: 263&ndash;4; cf. esp. Boring
1950: 332) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Natorp quotes Wundt: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no such thing as an inner sense that could, as an
organ of psychic perception, be contrasted with the outer senses as
the organs of the knowledge of nature
[<em>Naturerkenntnis</em>]&rdquo;. (Wundt 1896a: &sect;1,1; quoted at
Natorp 1912: 264)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-43" id="note-43">43.</a>
 This is, e.g., Boring&rsquo;s position: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Wundt never held that the experimental method is adequate to the whole
of psychology: the higher processes, he thought, must be got at by the
study of the history of human nature, his V&ouml;lkerpsychologie.
(Boring 1950: 328) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A case has recently been made, however, that Wundt did not consider
all <em>v&ouml;lkerpsychologische</em> phenomena to be in principle
beyond the scope of experimentation (Greenwood 2003).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-44" id="note-44">44.</a>
 Wundt inherited the term from the Herbartian psychologists, Heymann
Steinthal and Moritz Lazarus (cf. <em>L</em> III: 226, n.*). While it
literally means &ldquo;psychology of peoples&rdquo;, it is translated
as &ldquo;social&rdquo; or &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; psychology;
Titchener&rsquo;s translation, &ldquo;folk psychology&rdquo;, has an
entirely different connotation in contemporary philosophy of mind and
should be avoided.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-45" id="note-45">45.</a>
 Largely on the strength of the first two volumes of his
<em>V&ouml;lkerpsychologie</em> dealing with language, Wundt is
considered the father of psycholinguistics. He explains that language
is the &ldquo;most important of cultural-psychological products
[<em>Erzeugnis</em>]&rdquo; (<em>L</em> III: 225), because </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it expresses the lawfulness [<em>Gesetzm&auml;&szlig;igkeit</em>] of
<em>thinking</em>, [and] the different language types correspond to
specific phases [<em>Stufen</em>] in the development of this basic
spiritual function [<em>geistige Grundfunktion</em>]. (<em>L</em> III:
230) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For <em>VP</em>, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
linguistic processes are merely a means by which it can first find the
psychological laws of linguistic phenomena, and then to draw
conclusions from these about the general connection of psychic
processes. (<em>L</em> III: 228)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-46" id="note-46">46.</a>
 Wundt specifically distinguishes <em>V&ouml;lkerpsychologie</em> from
what he calls &ldquo;ethnic characterology&rdquo; (<em>L</em> III:
227); yet this is what he seems to have pursued in his 1915 book,
obviously under the influence of war, on <em>The Nations and their
Philosophy</em>. Sluga writes that this work </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
derived from [Wundt&rsquo;s <em>V&ouml;lkerpsychologie</em>], which
was at best a doubtful undertaking but which, under the conditions of
the time, served to lend recognition to all kinds of questionable
speculations about the distinctive character of the German nation.
(Sluga 1993: 105)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-47" id="note-47">47.</a>
 &ldquo;In truth, psychology is as much an empirical science
(<em>Erfahrungswissenschaft</em>) as physics and
chemistry&hellip;&rdquo; (<em>PP</em> I: 8).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-48" id="note-48">48.</a>
 It is just in this sense that it is right to say that Wundt </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
regarded psychology as the common basis for all scientific and
cultural knowledge and the bond uniting all the individual sciences,
and therefore as the &ldquo;science directly preparatory to
philosophy&rdquo;. (Wellek 1967: 349) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Psychology is a preparatory <em>part</em> of philosophy, not a
distinct science.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-49" id="note-49">49.</a>
 As discussed above, the natural and the spiritual aspects are
distinguished according to whether they are mediated (via the senses)
to consciousness, or are directly given. Thus natural science </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
seeks to determine the properties and reciprocal relations among
<em>objects</em>, &hellip; thus abstract[ing] &hellip; from the
subject&hellip;[, whereas] [p]sychology cancels that abstraction and
thus &hellip; investigates experience in its immediate reality. (Wundt
1896b: 12, quoted from Kusch 1995: 133, slightly modified)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-50" id="note-50">50.</a>
 Cf. Kusch 1995: 132. More specifically, it is <em>VP</em>&rsquo;s
quest to </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
discern [<em>Erkennen</em>], in the spiritual evolution and earliest
and simplest forms of [communal] life, the spiritual essence of
humanity [<em>das geistige Wesen des Menschen</em>] and so too the
basic precondition of historical life, (<em>L</em> III: 234) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
that lets psychology found the historical sciences (<em>L</em> III:
227&ndash;8).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-51" id="note-51">51.</a>
 Logic &ldquo;separates out of our manifold representational
connections of consciousness those [representations] that have a
legislative [<em>gesetzgebenden</em>] character for the development of
our knowledge [<em>Wissen</em>]&rdquo; (<em>L</em> I: 1).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-52" id="note-52">52.</a>
 Thus, for example, the Marburg neo-Kantians share with Wundt a
conception of the relation of philosophy to the natural sciences,
while Wundt distinguishes, like the Southwest School neo-Kantians
between nomothetic (natural) and idiographic (historical) sciences.
Later, Husserl, who like Wundt faced the task of simultaneously
establishing a new method and object for philosophical inquiry,
conceived his phenomenology as a &ldquo;pure psychology&rdquo; that
would reveal the essential structures of consciousness through a
meditative form of introspection or <em>Wesensschau</em>, by which
Husserl held philosophy could attain the status of a rigorous science.
Much research remains to be done on Wundt&rsquo;s relation to
Husserl.</p>

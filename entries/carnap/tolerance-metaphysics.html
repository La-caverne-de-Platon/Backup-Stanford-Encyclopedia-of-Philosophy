<h2>H. Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology</h2>

<p>
As discussed in the
 <a href="index-2.html#Aufb">main entry (Section 3)</a>
 on Carnap, the principle of tolerance was central to Carnap&rsquo;s
philosophy, as was the pluralism about possible language (and logic)
forms that comes with it. Tolerance was introduced explicitly in 1932,
first in a paper replying to Neurath (Carnap 1932e) on the question of
the appropriate form of &ldquo;protocol sentences&rdquo; (sentences in
which empirical observations are recorded), and then most famously in
&sect;17 of the <em>Logical Syntax</em>, which we will discuss below.
A case can be made (e.g., Friedman 2007; Carus 2007b), though, that
the principle of tolerance is also implicit in much of Carnap&rsquo;s
earlier work (see the supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html#ConsSyst"><em>Aufbau</em> (Section 1)</a>).
 Certainly it remained fundamental to all of Carnap&rsquo;s ideas
after its enunciation in late 1932.</p>

<p>
It is fair to say that the principle of tolerance taken by itself
(independently of, e.g., analyticity) was hardly discussed, or even
noticed, before its present, belated reception in the Carnap
literature. It is a new idea on the philosophical scene even today,
whose consequences are still being digested. It has certainly lost
none of its explosive revolutionary force as a radical program for
philosophy (Creath 2009), which is what has most divided commentators.
Like most revolutionary ideas, it has encountered steadfast and vocal
resistance. Most commentators have been concerned to limit the scope
of the principle of tolerance, to dilute it or trivialize it, while
the appreciative minority has mostly remained defensive. Much of the
literature, therefore, is devoted to clarification and the correction
of misunderstandings rather than positive explorations of the
principle of tolerance and its consequences (with a few exceptions:
Carus 2007a; Kitcher 2008; Creath 2009; Yap 2010; Kutz, Mossakowski,
and L&uuml;cke 2010; and Justus 2012). In section 1, we discuss the
context of Carnap&rsquo;s original introduction of the principle in
<em>Logical Syntax</em>, and then review some of its consequences for
his views concerning metaphysics and ontology in sections 2 and 3.
Throughout these sections it should be kept in mind that languages are
<em>calculi</em> for Carnap (&sect;2 of <em>Logical Syntax</em>),
including both rules of formation and rules of inference (see the
supplement on
 <a href="syntax.html"><em>Logical Syntax of Language</em></a>).
 So languages in Carnap&rsquo;s sense are not restricted to
specifications of well-formed terms and formulas.</p>

<h3 id="ToleLogiSynt">1. Tolerance in the <em>Logical Syntax</em></h3>

<p>
In the <em>Logical Syntax</em>, Carnap motivates tolerance by
considering the properties of the two mathematical languages he has
constructed (see the supplement on
 <a href="syntax.html"><em>Logical Syntax of Language</em></a>
 for the details): Language I can be shown to have the property that
for each of its closed formulas (without free variables), it is either
the case that the formula is derivable from the axioms of the system
or its negation is derivable from the axioms. (By G&ouml;del&rsquo;s
incompleteness theorems, this does not hold for all <em>open</em>
formulas.) Moreover, all of the predicates that can be formulated in
Language I are decidable: in Carnap&rsquo;s terms, Language I is
<em>definite</em>. This feature constitutes one reason why Language I
seems particularly suitable as a rational reconstruction of
<em>constructivist</em> or <em>intuitionistic</em> mathematics. In
particular, the only provable existence statements in Language I are
finitely restricted ones that allow for the construction of verifying
instances, as demanded by intuitionists.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, Carnap does not claim that Language I satisfies
each and every feature that one finds discussed in the
finitist-constructivist-intuitionist literature. For instance,
intuitionists notoriously refrain from certain applications of the
logical rule of <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> that would yield
unrestricted existence statements (which they nonetheless consider
well-formed), whereas Carnap prefers to preserve classical logic and
avoids such inferences instead by restricting the <em>syntactic
formation rules</em> of Language I. In the terms Carnap used with
respect to explication (see supplement on
 <a href="methodology.html">Methodology</a>),
 Language I should only be viewed as sufficiently
&ldquo;similar&rdquo; to constructivist mathematics to count as a
reasonably adequate reconstruction; or in Carnap&rsquo;s terms in the
<em>Syntax</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Some of tendencies which are commonly designated as
&ldquo;finitist&rdquo; or &ldquo;constructivist&rdquo; find, in a
certain sense, their realization in our definite Language I. &ldquo;In
a certain sense&rdquo;, let it be noted; for inasmuch as these
tendencies are, as a rule, only vaguely formulated, an exact statement
is not possible&hellip; We hold that the problems dealt with by
Intuitionism can be exactly formulated only by means of the
construction of a calculus, and that all the non-formal discussions
are to be regarded merely as more or less vague preliminaries to such
a construction (LSS: &sect;16).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As Carnap shows, both his constructivist Language I and the second
language that he considers in the <em>Logical Syntax</em>&mdash;the
indefinite Language II that reflects classical mathematics and allows
for undecidable formulas and unrestricted quantification&mdash;may be
constructed in precise terms; both of them may turn out to be useful
for certain purposes; and neither of them needs to be regarded as
&ldquo;the&rdquo; uniquely determined &ldquo;correct&rdquo; foundation
of mathematics:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Once the fact is realized that all the pros and cons of the
intuitionist discussions are concerned with the forms of a calculus,
questions will no longer be put in the form: &ldquo;What <em>is</em>
this or that like?&rdquo; but instead we shall ask: &ldquo;How <em>do
we wish to arrange</em> this or that in the language to be
constructed?&rdquo; or, from the theoretical standpoint: &ldquo;What
consequences will ensue if we construct a language in this or that
way? On this view the dogmatic attitude which renders so many
discussions unfruitful disappears. When we here construct Language I
in such a way that it is a definite language, and thus fulfils certain
conditions laid down by Intuitionism, we do not mean thereby to
suggest that this is the only possible or justifiable form of
language. (LSS: &sect;16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In analogy with the existence of different types of geometry (e.g.,
Euclidean vs. Non-Euclidean geometries), which he had investigated in
his doctoral dissertation (see the
 <a href="index-2.html#DerRaum">main entry (Section 2.2)</a>),
 Carnap points to the existence of multiple types of logical
frameworks we might construct, investigate, and apply for different
purposes. For instance, since Language II happens to be more
expressive than Language I (as mentioned in the supplement on
 <a href="syntax.html"><em>Logical Syntax of Language</em></a>,
 e.g., <em>derivability</em> for Language I can only be formally
defined in Language II), it is more suitable as a rational
reconstruction of the &ldquo;syntax language&rdquo; (metalanguage) of
Language I. For the same reason, various concepts, principles, and
arguments from real analysis, set theory, and physics (e.g.,
indefinite and impredicative concepts from set theory, set-theoretic
existence principles, and certain scientific concepts for physical
magnitudes) can only be reconstructed in Language II (&sect;26,
&sect;38a, &sect;40) while not being available in Language I. Carnap
summarizes the situation in &sect;40: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For anyone who takes the point of view of physicalism [the claim that
scientific terms are reducible to physical terms], it follows that our
Language II forms a complete syntactical framework for science, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
which suggests that Language II is preferable over Language I for
particular <em>scientific</em> purposes (though not for all purposes
whatsoever).</p>

<p>
This leads Carnap to formulate his famous</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Principle of Tolerance: It is not our business to set up
prohibitions, but to arrive at conventions</em> (LSS: &sect;17)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
in which &ldquo;convention&rdquo; means that every formal language is
&ldquo;a matter of free choice&rdquo; (&sect;86). In other words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>In logic, there are no morals.</em> Everyone is at liberty to
build up his own logic, i.e., his own form of language, as he wishes.
All that is required of him is that, if he wishes to discuss it, he
must state his methods clearly, and give syntactical rules instead of
philosophical arguments (LSS: &sect;17).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Accordingly, Carnap views the classical debates in the foundations of
mathematics&mdash;such as those about mathematical realism,
intuitionism, logicism, and formalism&mdash;as debates concerning
<em>proposals of languages for mathematics</em> (&sect;78, &sect;84),
which are not to be settled on factual or inferential grounds. (For
the same reason, the &ldquo;logicism&rdquo; endorsed by Carnap in the
<em>Logical Syntax</em> (&sect;84) is no longer the familiar reductive
logicism of Frege or Russell.) As Carnap points out (p. 52), the new
position merely generalizes to philosophy, or to knowledge as a whole,
what mathematicians have routinely practiced for centuries; he
particularly cites the mathematician Karl Menger (1930), who
contributed to the discussions in the Vienna Circle, and had already
begun to extend this attitude from mathematics to the philosophy of
mathematics, arguing for a version of tolerance about different
formulations of intuitionistic logic (without using the word
&ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; explicitly).</p>

<p>
While Carnap does not say much about this in the <em>Logical
Syntax</em> itself, it is clear that tolerance must extend also to
non-logical and non-mathematical languages. Soon after, in
<em>Testability and Meaning</em> (1936&ndash;37), he says about
<em>empirical</em> terms, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It should be noticed that the term &ldquo;atomic sentence&rdquo;, as
here defined, is not at all understood to refer to ultimate facts. Our
theory does not assume anything like ultimate facts. It is a matter of
convention which predicates are taken as primitive predicates of a
certain language L. (TM1: 448) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As described in the supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#QuinCritCarnReduVeriTheoMean">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 1)</a>,
 Carnap constructs a whole sequence of &ldquo;empiricist
languages&rdquo; in <em>Testability and Meaning</em>, leaving open the
question whether to choose any of them at all. And as we point out in
the supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#StruCarnMatuTheoReco">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 6)</a>,
 Carnap (1966) acknowledges the particular utility of a
&ldquo;realistic language&rdquo; for the purposes of the working
scientist. Accordingly, in his &ldquo;Empiricism, Semantics, and
Ontology&rdquo; (1950a, hereafter ESO), which we discuss in more
detail in sections 2 and 3 below, he again emphasizes the pragmatic
dimension of scientific language choice:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
To decree dogmatic prohibitions of certain linguistic forms instead of
testing them by their success or failure in practical use, is worse
than futile; it is positively harmful because it may obstruct
scientific progress&hellip; Let us be cautious in making assertions
and critical in examining them, but tolerant in permitting linguistic
forms (ESO: 221)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Nonetheless, Carnap&rsquo;s tolerant pluralism is still often
misunderstood. In the recent literature on logical pluralism (Shapiro
2014 gives an overview), for instance, which was triggered by a series
of papers culminating in Beall and Restall (2006), Carnapian tolerance
serves as one of the starting points. But Restall (2002) presents
Beall&rsquo;s and Restall&rsquo;s &ldquo;new&rdquo; logical pluralism
as one concerning different logical consequence relations on one and
the <em>same</em> language, which he distinguishes from Carnap&rsquo;s
supposed pluralism about <em>different</em> languages. However, that
demarcation is questionable: as explained in the
 <a href="index-2.html#TowaAufb">main entry (Section 2)</a>,
 Carnap was interested in the proof-theoretic and, after his semantic
turn, model-theoretic construction of artificial logical frameworks.
He individuated such frameworks just as any modern logician would do,
including Beall and Restall: in particular, logical frameworks may be
distinct in virtue of distinct sets of rules of formation, distinct
sets of rules of inference, or distinct sets of models and semantic
rules of evaluation. Carnap would not have denied that two distinct
frameworks, such as, e.g., frameworks for classical and intuitionistic
logic, may be based on one and the same formal object language (such
that the two frameworks involve the same logical vocabulary and the
same syntactic formation rules but distinct rules of inference and
distinct sets of models and semantic rules). Nor would he have denied
that two distinct frameworks may be used to logically reconstruct one
and the same fragment of informal language and reasoning, such as,
e.g., the logic of a fragment of mathematics, and that they may be
equally or variably successful in doing so (by being more or less
similar to what is reconstructed, or more or less fruitful, and so
forth&mdash;see supplement on
 <a href="methodology.html">Methodology</a>),
 relative to their respective purposes and contexts. It is true that,
in addition, Carnap would also have distinguished classical negation,
as being proof-theoretically and/or semantically interpreted in a
classical framework, from intuitionistic negation, as being
proof-theoretically and/or semantically interpreted in an
intuitionistic framework: but it is hard to see why this fairly
innocent move should exclude him from being a logical pluralist of
Beall and Restall&rsquo;s preferred type. After all, Carnap would
still allow for negation in the constructed classical framework and
negation in the constructed intuitionistic framework to be rival
explications of one and the same connective in natural language, that
is, of the &ldquo;not&rdquo; of mathematical practice.</p>

<p>
Similarly for logical consequence: Restall states that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
As a pluralist about logical consequence, I take it that there is no
further fact of the matter as to whether explosion, or disjunctive
syllogism, are <em>really</em> valid. For me, that question makes no
more sense than to ask if a function on the real line is
<em>really</em> smooth, without saying more about the notion of
smoothness&hellip; The same goes for logical consequence. I take it
that this is a pretheoretic notion which may be made precise in a
number of different ways. (2002: section 1) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But Carnap (1950a) takes exactly this position; there is no further
fact of the matter whether any principle of logic is <em>really</em>
valid, any more than there is any fact of the matter whether the
external world <em>really</em> exists (see
 <a href="#OntoMetaOnto">section 3</a>
 below). And moreover, what Restall says is precisely Carnap&rsquo;s
position on the explication of concepts in general&mdash;that is,
regarding the transformation of a more or less inexact concept into a
more exact one (see the supplement on
 <a href="methodology.html#Expl">Methodology (Section 1)</a>):
 </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In a problem of explication the datum, viz., the explicandum, is not
given in exact terms&hellip; if a solution for a problem of
explication is proposed, we cannot decide in an exact way whether it
is right or wrong. Strictly speaking, the question whether the
solution is right or wrong makes no good sense because there is no
clear-cut answer. The question should rather be whether the proposed
solution is satisfactory, whether it is more satisfactory than another
one, and the like (Carnap 1950b: &sect;2) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
where &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo; here means relative to some norm or
practical requirement. E.g., in &sect;2 of <em>Meaning and
Necessity</em>, Carnap describes explicitly his aim of explicating, in
precisely that sense, <em>logical or analytic truth and
consequence</em>, which are &ldquo;customary, but not quite exact,
concepts&rdquo;, and he goes about explicating consequence by
quantification over a suitable space of points of evaluation (see the
supplement on
 <a href="semantics.html">Semantics</a>)
 that can be constructed in different ways, just as Beall and Restall
(2006) suggest.</p>

<p>
Much of the recent discussion of the principle of tolerance was
inspired by G&ouml;del&rsquo;s critique of it, unpublished until 1995,
that was originally intended for the Schilpp (1963) volume on Carnap
in the <em>Library of Living Philosophers</em>. G&ouml;del withdrew
his paper, but six successive drafts of it were found in his
<em>Nachla&szlig;</em>, of which several have now been published
(G&ouml;del *1953/9). It appears, from its title (&ldquo;Is
Mathematics Syntax of Language?&rdquo;) and exposition, to focus
specifically on the &ldquo;syntax&rdquo; thesis, or more generally on
the &ldquo;linguistic&rdquo; accounts of the foundations of
mathematics deriving from Wittgenstein&rsquo;s <em>Tractatus</em>
(Goldfarb 1995: 325). However, G&ouml;del himself understood that
Carnap had meanwhile left behind that view (in its <em>Logical
Syntax</em> form), and recent commentary has focused on the principle
of tolerance.</p>

<p>
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s critique is based on his second incompleteness
theorem. For mathematics to be regarded as purely syntactical (and
thus devoid of empirical content), he argues, it must be proven that
no purely linguistic stipulation can possibly have empirical
consequences; otherwise mathematics would be in danger of making
empirical claims on purely arbitrary or definitional grounds. In
particular, it needs to be proven that the linguistic framework in
question is consistent, for otherwise all sentences, including all
empirical sentences, would be provable in it. But by the second
incompleteness theorem, no framework that includes enough mathematics
has the resources to prove its own consistency; and any consistency
proof presupposes the consistency of a stronger meta-framework that is
required for the proof. Therefore, any attempt to prove consistency
either leads to an infinite regress or to a mathematical framework
that is simply taken as given and which (in G&ouml;del&rsquo;s view)
refers to some realm of abstract entities again.</p>

<p>
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s criticism has been widely discussed (Richardson
1994; Ricketts 1994, 1996; Parsons 1999; Friedman 1999; Potter 2000;
Ben-Menahem 2006). It is, however, not clear whether it is actually
relevant to Carnap&rsquo;s conception of mathematics in the
<em>Logical Syntax</em>. After all, Carnap does hold that &ldquo;pure
syntax is nothing other than a part of arithmetic&rdquo; (&sect;24), a
fact which he himself exploited when he arithmetized Language I along
G&ouml;delian lines in Part II of the <em>Logical Syntax</em>. Carnap
was well aware that his consistency proof for Language II in Part III
of the <em>Logical Syntax</em> did not give him </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
absolute certainty that contradictions in the object-language II
cannot arise&hellip; since the proof is carried out in a
syntax-language which has richer resources than Language II. (LSS:
&sect;34) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
From Carnap&rsquo;s point of view, mathematical theories were to be
reconstructed as particular linguistic frameworks, and
&ldquo;pure&rdquo; linguistic frameworks (without empirical
consequences) could always be viewed as mathematical theories.
Consequently, just as he thinks that there is no need to justify
language forms and their logics so long as they turn out to be
practically useful, there is also no need to justify mathematical
systems other than by their practical consequences; in particular, no
consistency proof is required. He did not think either the mere
acceptance of a linguistic framework would somehow guarantee the
logical and mathematical theorems provable in the framework to be true
(see Ebbs 2017: Section 1.6). If a mathematical system turned out to
be inconsistent, its postulates would have to be modified;
that&rsquo;s it. (Compare his later expression of the same thought in
Carnap 1958: 240. This is similar to the attitude of the practicing
mathematician who may presuppose ZFC set theory as a foundation
without demanding a consistency proof for it.) As Awodey &amp; Carus
(2003, 2004) point out, G&ouml;del was mistaken to require of a
proposed linguistic framework that it be <em>provably</em> consistent.
The syntactical approach requires only that the stipulated logical
system be consistent (that is, it is not the case that every statement
logically implies every other statement, for otherwise the system
would not be mathematically or scientifically useful)&mdash;not that
it be provably consistent.</p>

<p>
This apparently subtle difference is very important, though. It might
be true that a <em>proof</em> of the principle of tolerance understood
as a <em>claim</em> concerning a range of logical systems would
require provable consistency of these systems. And G&ouml;del&rsquo;s
argument does show that, understood this way, the principle of
tolerance cannot be proven. But Carnap did not regard it as a
<em>claim</em>, nor of course did he attempt to <em>prove</em> it.
G&ouml;del <em>did</em> regard it as a claim, which he set out to
refute; moreover, some modern commentators regard this refutation as
successful, and the principle of tolerance accordingly as refuted
(Potter 2000: Ch. 11; Ben-Menahem 2006: Ch. 5); they argue explicitly
what G&ouml;del had assumed, viz. that Carnap&rsquo;s principle of
tolerance requires <em>provable</em> consistency (Potter 2000,
especially pp. 270&ndash;277). But this appears to be a
misunderstanding (Awodey &amp; Carus 2004: 211&ndash;13); the
principle of tolerance consisted for Carnap in something like a
proposed set of regulative principles: the development of new language
forms should not be &ldquo;hampered by the striving for
&lsquo;correctness&rsquo;&rdquo;, instead we should embark on the
exploration of &ldquo;the boundless ocean of unlimited
possibilities&rdquo; that lies before us (<em>Logical Syntax</em>,
Foreword).</p>

<h3 id="ToleMeta">2. Tolerance and Metaphysics</h3>

<p>
As briefly indicated in the main article on Carnap, his positive
conceptual engineering program, though far more important in his own
mind, has been overshadowed in the folklore about Carnap by the
negative corollary that ontological claims <em>outside</em> a language
framework (addressing <em>external</em> questions, in the terminology
of &ldquo;Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology&rdquo;, to be discussed
further below) should be ignored or left aside. They should in any
case not be taken literally, Carnap suggested, but re-interpreted as
practical questions about which language framework or explication is
appropriate to the particular use that one is making of the concept in
the context at hand. </p>

<p>
With the recent revival of metaphysics within analytic philosophy,
this attitude has now come under a cloud. As the title of Carnap
(1932a) says famously (or rather infamously), metaphysics could and
should be &ldquo;overcome&rdquo; by the logical analysis of language.
We will first summarize the basic ingredients of Carnap&rsquo;s
philosophy on which this view on metaphysics rests, which will allow
us to position the different criticisms of metaphysics that Carnap
developed over the years <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em> the main themes of
his work and contemporary views of metaphysics. This in turn leads us
to a sketch of what might be regarded as a Carnapian successor project
to certain aspects of traditional metaphysics. Finally, in
 <a href="#OntoMetaOnto">section 3</a>,
 we will present Carnap&rsquo;s account of ontology and show how it
remained largely unchanged in essentials throughout his career even
when the way of articulating it changed in response to such turning
points as the principle of tolerance or the introduction of
semantics.</p>

<p>
For Carnap, one task (perhaps the central task) of philosophy was the
logical reconstruction of <em>scientific sentences</em> in formally
precise linguistic frameworks (see supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories</a>);
 this presupposes that, if these sentences belong to a sufficiently
empirically successful part of science, it will be possible to
reconstruct them with sufficient formal precision. In any such
reconstruction, the parts of science in question will be
<em>internal</em> to the framework in which it is reconstructed, in
the terms of Carnap&rsquo;s best-known paper, &ldquo;Empiricism,
Semantics, and Ontology&rdquo; (1950a). By this Carnap meant that the
scientific sentences accepted in that part of science can all be
derived or supported with the help of logical rules, analytic
postulates or inductive rules laid down by the framework. Let us call
such frameworks in which scientific languages and theories are
reconstructed <em>object frameworks</em>.</p>

<p>
In &ldquo;Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology&rdquo;, Carnap went on
to contrast such &ldquo;internal&rdquo; sentences and questions with
the &ldquo;external&rdquo; ones that are often asked in traditional
metaphysics. These do not ask whether something exists <em>within the
rules of some (explicitly specified) framework</em>, but whether
something exists <em>period</em>, quite independently of any language
framework in which the question might be articulated. Taken literally,
at face value, external questions and sentences have no cognitive
significance, in Carnap&rsquo;s view; they cannot be true or false.
The only sense he could make of them was to regard them as practical
sentences and questions concerning framework choice, such as
&ldquo;Shall we introduce this form of expression into our
language?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Should we&mdash;for a specified
purpose&mdash;use this language or that one?&rdquo; (ESO: section
3).</p>

<p>
<em>Philosophical</em> sentences, then, to be comprehensible, should
be reconstructed, in Carnap&rsquo;s view, as being <em>about</em> the
construction and the properties of the formal linguistic object
frameworks in which the scientific sentences are framed. Such
philosophical sentences are then at the meta-level with respect to
those object frameworks, and may either be reconstructed in formal
meta-frameworks (as Carnap does, e.g., in the <em>Logical
Syntax</em>); then they are internal to those meta-frameworks. Or they
may be left semi-formal (just as ordinary mathematics is developed in
a semi-formal manner). Either way, they are <em>external</em> to the
object-framework of the scientific sentences.</p>

<p>
Whether on the object level or on the meta-level, artificial
<em>linguistic frameworks</em> are constructed by laying down their
syntactic formation rules, rules of inference, (later, from the
mid-1930s) semantic rules (see the supplement on
 <a href="semantics.html">Semantics</a>),
 and (later still, from the mid-1940s) inductive rules (see the
supplement on
 <a href="inductive-logic.html">Inductive Logic</a>);
 for more on frameworks, see the
 <a href="index-2.html#TowaAufb">main entry (Section 2)</a>.
 At the same time, part of what it means to choose or construct a
framework is to choose or determine the sentences that &ldquo;come
with&rdquo; the framework: these are the sentences that are
analytic(ally true) in the framework (see supplements on
 <a href="carnap-quine.html">Carnap versus Quine on the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction</a>
 and
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories</a>).
 Such analytic sentences, which include the logical and mathematical
truths of the framework, are simultaneously internal to
&ldquo;their&rdquo; framework <em>and</em> reflect some of its
features&mdash;as they are provable just from the rules of inference
<em>of the framework itself</em>, true in virtue of the semantic rules
<em>of the framework alone</em> (see the supplement on
 <a href="semantics.html">Semantics</a>),
 and they cannot be disconfirmed by those parts of science that are
reconstructed <em>within the framework</em>. The status of such
analytic statements may always be conveyed by metalinguistic claims,
such as &ldquo;sentence <i>A</i> is
analytic-in-framework-<i>L</i>&rdquo;, which can be derived from the
definition of the framework <i>L</i>. In contrast, synthetic sentences
in a framework may turn out to be false, and they can only be tested,
and thus confirmed or disconfirmed, empirically. While frameworks may
be chosen freely (if they only include logical-mathematical rules and
semantic postulates, as in the case of the abstract frameworks for
semantics discussed in &ldquo;Empiricism, Semantics, and
Ontology&rdquo;), they may still differ concerning their practical
utility for different purposes. The same holds for the rational
reconstructions or explications that are carried out within them
(which may be more or less exact, more or less fruitful, more or less
simple, and so forth&mdash;see supplement on
 <a href="methodology.html">Methodology</a>).
 The same body of mathematical and scientific knowledge before
reconstruction can be reconstructed within different linguistic
frameworks, the choice of which for that very purpose may pay off
pragmatically in different ways. In that sense, mathematics and
science delineate structural invariances across different frameworks
(compare supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#StruCarnMatuTheoReco">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 6)</a>);
 all of these are key components of Carnap&rsquo;s philosophical
program.</p>

<p>
When Carnap&rsquo;s program, as just sketched, is applied to
traditional <em>metaphysical</em> claims, there are three
possibilities: these claims can either be reconstructed as scientific
claims in a precise enough linguistic object-framework. Or they can be
reconstructed&mdash;formalized in a formal meta-framework, or
otherwise at least semi-formalized&mdash;as philosophical proposals or
claims concerning the linguistic (syntactic, logical, semantic,
pragmatic) properties of such an object framework for the
reconstruction of science. In this case they are external to such an
object framework. Or, finally, it may not be possible to reconstruct
them logically in sufficiently clear and precise terms at all.</p>

<p>
The last possibility corresponds to the <em>first type of
criticism</em> of metaphysics that one can find in Carnap&rsquo;s
work: for some metaphysical statements, it seems they cannot be
reconstructed formally or semi-formally at all, on whatever language
level. That is the main worry expressed by Carnap in his notorious
&ldquo;&Uuml;berwindung der Metaphysik durch logische Analyse der
Sprache&rdquo; (Carnap 1932a); some metaphysical sentences either seem
to include words without meaning (e.g., &ldquo;the absolute&rdquo;,
&ldquo;thing in itself&rdquo;), or they are not well-formed in logical
syntax (even when they might be well-formed in the grammar of natural
language), or both&mdash;such as, Carnap claims, Heidegger&rsquo;s
well-known claim, &ldquo;Das Nichts selbst nichtet&rdquo; (&ldquo;The
Nothing itself nihilates&rdquo;). Such metaphysical
sentences&mdash;into which we can be misled by the logical
shortcomings of natural languages&mdash;are revealed to be
pseudo-sentences by logical analysis. They are <em>nonsense</em>, in
the sense of not having any theoretical content; they are not answers
to any coherently expressible questions. If anything, they merely
manage to convey an attitude towards life, in which case the more
appropriate means of expressing their intended
<em>Lebensgef&uuml;hl</em> [attitude toward life] would be works of
art that do not pretend to convey theoretical content. (Carnap
mentions Nietzsche&rsquo;s <em>Zarathustra</em> as a positive instance
of an application of poetic means to that effect.) Similar criticisms
of metaphysical language can be found in the <em>Aufbau</em> (1928a,
see &sect;30&ndash;31 on the &ldquo;confusion of spheres&rdquo;) and
in his <em>Scheinprobleme der Philosophie</em> (1928b). Just as formal
type theory avoided Russell&rsquo;s famous paradox of &ldquo;the class
of all classes that do not include themselves as member&rdquo; by
making it impossible to even formulate the corresponding description,
certain never-ending metaphysical debates could be avoided by
realizing that they could not even be formulated in the languages of
<em>Aufbau</em>-type constitution systems (see supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html"><em>Aufbau</em></a>).
 From the viewpoint of Carnap&rsquo;s later philosophy, what the
Carnap of 1932 overlooked in his early criticism of metaphysics was
that there was not anything like <em>the</em> logical system in which
metaphysical sentences could be reformulated. He had not yet attained
his post-<em>Syntax</em> radical tolerance about logic
 (<a href="#ToleLogiSynt">section 1</a>
 above). (Similarly, in the now standard first-order language of set
theory, the description of the Russell class <em>can</em> be
formulated&mdash;but one can prove that this description does not
denote a set.) On the other hand, even the Carnap of the <em>Logical
Syntax</em> regarded the lasting resistance of certain metaphysical
sentences to logical regimentation as evidence against them being
sentences in the logical sense of the term. Indeed, he affirms his
earlier view when he says</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; syntactical problems acquire a greater significance by virtue
of the anti-metaphysical attitude represented by the Vienna Circle.
According to this view, the sentences of metaphysics are
pseudo-sentences which on logical analysis are proved to be either
empty phrases or phrases which violate the rules of syntax. (LSS:
&sect;2)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
although it is not clear if he takes this description of
pseudo-sentences as a definition of the &ldquo;sentences of
metaphysics&rdquo; or as a substantive characterization of many or all
sentences of traditional metaphysics. Either way, this part of
Carnap&rsquo;s criticism of metaphysics would hardly be an issue for
much of <em>present-day</em> analytic metaphysics in which
metaphysical statements are indeed often formulated using logical
languages (e.g., of modal logic) in which these statements are
logically well-formed.</p>

<p>
So let us assume that a given metaphysical sentence can in fact be
reconstructed in sufficiently clear and precise terms within a
well-specified framework. Carnap&rsquo;s next question would be: is it
meant to be a scientific sentence in an object framework? This leads
us to Carnap&rsquo;s <em>second type of criticism</em> of metaphysics:
when a metaphysical sentence is scientific, it should be synthetic in
the framework in which it is reconstructed, and it should be
<em>possible</em>, at least in principle and in the long run, to test
and disconfirm it <em>empirically</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The first efforts at explanation, those of Ionian natural
philosophers, were certainly metaphysical; the world is all fire, or
all water, or all change. Those early efforts at scientific
explanation can be viewed in two different ways. We can say: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This is not science, but pure metaphysics. There is no possibility of
confirmation, no correspondence rules for connecting the theory with
observable phenomena. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the other hand, we can say: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
These Ionian theories are certainly not scientific, but at least they
are pictorial visions of theories. They are the first primitive
beginnings of science. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It must not be forgotten that, both in the history of science and in
the psychological history of a creative scientist, a theory has often
first appeared as a kind of visualization, a vision that comes as an
inspiration to a scientist long before he has discovered
correspondence rules that may help in confirming his theory. When
Democritus said that everything consists of atoms, he certainly had
not the slightest confirmation for his theory. Nevertheless, it was a
stroke of genius, a profound insight, because two thousand years later
his vision was confirmed. We should not, therefore, reject too rashly
any anticipatory vision of a theory, provided it is one that may be
tested at some future time. We are on solid ground, however, if we
issue the warning that no hypothesis can claim to be scientific unless
there is the <em>possibility</em> that it can be tested&hellip; When a
theory is first proposed, we should not demand more than this. (Carnap
1966: 244f)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the more recent literature, Ladyman and Ross&rsquo;s (2007)
naturalized view of metaphysics, which urges metaphysicians to
reflect, and contribute to, current scientific practice, might get
close to what Carnap had in mind here. (Indeed, Ladyman and Ross 2007
begins with a quotation from Carnap and goes on to identify itself, in
this respect, explicitly with Carnap&rsquo;s standpoint:
&ldquo;Fortunately, in philosophy&rsquo;s previous episodes of
detachment from empirical inquiry, the Humes, Russells, and Carnaps
have turned up when needed to save the enterprise from itself. While
not claiming a mantle of their magnitude, we are here embarked on a
mission of disciplinary rescue in their spirit&rdquo; (2007: 27).)</p>

<p>
However, Carnap was never able to make this second type of criticism
sufficiently precise for it to be applicable in practice. Even his
later attempt, in &ldquo;The Methodological Character of Theoretical
Concepts&rdquo; (1956a: &sect;VI&ndash;VII), to explicate the
distinction between empirically significant descriptive theoretical
terms in science and empirically insignificant descriptive terms in
metaphysics turned out to be unsuccessful, as was the further step,
based on this distinction for terms, of distinguishing empirically
significant sentences from insignificant ones (1956a: &sect;VIII).
(Though Lutz (2012c: 283&ndash;285, 289&ndash;290, and 293&ndash;295)
not only provides a detailed reconstruction of these attempts and a
survey of the relevant literature on the counterexamples to such
definitions, but also suggests amendments, building on earlier
suggestions by Creath (1976) and others, and argues for a more
positive overall assessment of the project of explicating empirical
significance.)</p>

<p>
Alternatively, once made sufficiently precise, metaphysical claims
might not turn out to be scientific-synthetic claims at the object
level, but either refer explicitly to features <em>of</em> a
linguistic framework, in which case they would be metalinguistic and
framework-relative; or they would be analytic in a framework, in which
case they would be object-linguistic and framework-relative, while
their status could still be expressed and derived by metalinguistic
means. This leads us to Carnap&rsquo;s <em>third type of
criticism</em> of metaphysics, which he combines with a criticism of
Wittgenstein:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The fact that Wittgenstein does not believe in the possibility of the
exact formulation of the sentences of the logic of science has as its
consequence that he does not demand any scientific exactitude in his
own formulations, and that he draws no sharp line of demarcation
between the formulations of the logic of science and those of
metaphysics</p>

<p>
&hellip; translatability into the formal mode of speech&mdash;that is,
into syntactical sentences&mdash;is the criterion which separates the
proper sentences of the logic of science from the other philosophical
sentences&mdash;we may call them metaphysical. (LSS: &sect;73)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here metaphysical sentences are <em>characterized</em> and criticized
as those philosophical sentences which cannot be reconstructed as
sentences expressing syntactic (or, in his later work, semantic or
pragmatic) properties of a linguistic framework or its members. But
actually, as we will see in the following paragraphs below, there is
more continuity than meets the eye between a number of traditional
metaphysical questions and Carnap&rsquo;s pragmatic explication of
external questions as questions about frameworks. His 1934 <em>ad
hoc</em> negative definition of metaphysics does not actually exhaust
the traditional category&mdash;as he himself later admitted. There
would appear to be room, in other words, for a successor project to
(some parts of) traditional metaphysics within Carnap&rsquo;s
apparently quite rigid strictures. Such a successor project would
encompass <em> those statements that characterize linguistic
frameworks and considerations bearing on framework construction and on
comparisons or choices among frameworks</em>. Also included would be
statements (on a more local scale) <em>that characterize particular
explications and considerations bearing on the suitability of, and
choice among, explications</em>. These statements can be external to a
framework (syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic metastatements about
frameworks), or internal to a framework but express properties of the
framework internally (analytic sentences). The investigation and
rational appraisal of such statements might be called an
&ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; Carnapian successor project to traditional
metaphysics.</p> <!-- bib so far -->

<p>
Does this mean that philosophy, in Carnap&rsquo;s eyes, is clearly
demarcated from science, as the &ldquo;internal to an object
framework&rdquo; versus &ldquo;external to an object framework&rdquo;
distinction seems to suggest? Or is the logic of science simply a part
of (meta-)science? Dreben (1990, 1994), following the lead of Quine,
thought that Carnap&rsquo;s supposedly &ldquo;fundamental
distinction&rdquo; between analytic and synthetic sentences served the
goal of preserving a space for philosophy <em>distinct from</em>
science. Versions of the same thought can be found, e.g., in Hylton
(1998: 46&ndash;49; 2007), Ricketts (2004, 2009), and Maddy (2007:
65&ndash;84). Indeed, Carnap certainly had a form of
&ldquo;two-level&rdquo; conception (Maddy 2007: 47), and there is
undoubtedly an analogy between Carnap&rsquo;s internal-external
distinction and Kant&rsquo;s empirical-transcendental distinction
(Bird 2006: 92&ndash;96) which both philosophers employed in their
criticism of metaphysics. On the other hand, where Kant had wanted to
build a leaner and meaner metaphysics on a more modest basis, Carnap
thought he could do without it entirely&mdash;though he may well have
been willing to countenance a &ldquo;successor project&rdquo; to some
parts of metaphysics as we have outlined it here.</p>

<p>
In the above anti-metaphysical quotation from &sect;73 of the
<em>Logical Syntax</em>, the legitimate sentences of
<em>Wissenschaftslogik</em> (the logic of science) are distinguished
from metaphysical ones by a criterion&mdash;translatability into the
formal mode of speech&mdash;that Carnap himself would give up only a
year or so after these lines appeared in print. And in fact, although
he continued to seek a way of making the distinction between
meaningful scientific sentences and metaphysical ones precise (in
which, as we saw, he never succeeded), he eventually gave up on the
whole idea of distinguishing a legitimate domain of
&ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; sentences from the cognitively meaningless
ones with full precision:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In earlier periods, I sometimes made attempts to give an explication
of the term &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo;. The domain of those problems
which I proposed to call &ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; became step by
step more comprehensive&hellip; Yet actually none of my explications
seemed fully satisfactory to me even when I proposed them; and I did
not like the explications proposed by others any better. Finally, I
gave up the search&hellip; it is unwise to attempt such an explication
because each of them is more or less artificial. It seems better to
leave the term &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; without any sharp boundary
lines. (Carnap 1963b: 862)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It was consistent with this admission of defeat that Carnap also
allowed that some of what he might previously have excluded as
&ldquo;metaphysical&rdquo; could be regarded as concerned with
legitimate framework problems; </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
many metaphysical theses and discussions can certainly be regarded as
more or less conscious preparatory stages on the way to a systematic
logic and science, and as preliminary to framework analyses. (1963b:
862) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He mentions the work of Aristotle, Leibniz, Kant, Peirce, Whitehead,
and Dewey as examples. Moreover, he thought of these problems as
having fundamental importance, and had no desire to marginalize or
downplay them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In particular, many problems concerning conceptual frameworks seem to
me to belong to the most important problems of philosophy. I am
thinking here both of theoretical investigations and of practical
deliberations and decisions with respect to an acceptance or a change
of frameworks, especially of the most general frameworks containing
categorial concepts which are fundamental for the representation of
all knowledge. (1963b: 862) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So these &ldquo;theoretical investigations&rdquo; and &ldquo;practical
deliberations and decisions&rdquo; concerning &ldquo;an acceptance or
a change of frameworks&rdquo; (particular the most general ones
&ldquo;containing categorial concepts&rdquo;) may be viewed as
Carnap&rsquo;s replacement for (and explication of, in the sense given
in the supplement on
 <a href="methodology.html">Methodology</a>)
 traditional metaphysics.</p>

<p>
Such reconstructions of metaphysical statements would mostly take the
form not of </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
an <em>assertion</em> but of a <em>proposal</em> [of a language or an
explication]. Any dispute about the truth or falsehood of such a
thesis is quite mistaken &hellip; we can at most discuss the utility
of the proposal, or investigate its consequences. (LSS: &sect;78) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And a proposal, unlike an assertion, takes the form of what Carnap
would later, in the final chapter of his replies to critics (the Reply
to Kaplan, Carnap 1963b), call an &ldquo;optative&rdquo;, i.e., a
normative sentence. For Carnap, it makes no more sense to attribute
truth or falsity to a proposal than it does to attribute truth or
falsity to any other normative sentence. It was in this sense that he
had sometimes said in earlier writings that normative (including
value) sentences have no <em>cognitive</em> meaning. In his later
writing, he was at pains to stress that this did <em>not</em> mean (as
many had taken him to mean) that normative and value sentences are
altogether <em>meaningless</em>, like some sentences of metaphysics.
This functional classification of different uses of language,
especially normative language, had sometimes (following Ayer 1935 and
Stevenson 1944) been called &ldquo;emotivism&rdquo;, but Carnap
thought the connotations of this name were highly misleading and
coined the new term &ldquo;non-cognitivism&rdquo;&mdash;which has
stuck. And this Carnapian functionalism (Creath 1994) has been
generalized&mdash;along Carnapian lines, with explicit reference to
Carnap&mdash;by Huw Price (1997). Carus (2018) argues that much of
Price&rsquo;s globalized functionalism is already implicit or even
explicit in Carnap&rsquo;s own writings; in a reply, Price (2018)
largely agrees. </p>

<p>
Such linguistic proposals would thus be answers to &ldquo;external
questions&rdquo;, in the terminology of &ldquo;Empiricism, Semantics,
and Ontology&rdquo; (ESO: 378), that is, just what might previously
have been called metaphysical &ldquo;questions concerning the
existence or reality of <em>the system of entities as a
whole</em>&rdquo;, and in fact they are in Carnap&rsquo;s view
entirely <em>legitimate</em> external questions once they are
understood as (non-cognitive) <em>practical</em> questions regarding
the acceptance or use of frameworks or explications.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Those who raise [such a] question&hellip; have perhaps in mind not a
theoretical question as their formulation seems to suggest, but rather
a practical question, a matter of a practical decision concerning the
structure of our language. We have to make the choice whether or not
to accept and use the forms of expression in the framework in
question. (ESO: 378&ndash;379)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Many have supposed (e.g., George 2012, Irzik 2003) that Carnap&rsquo;s
non-cognitivism leads to a certain irrationalism, since it may be
thought to preclude application of reason to value questions or
practical decisions, including decisions among proposed
<em>cognitive</em> frameworks or explications. There can be no
rational assertion for Carnap, according to this line of thought, no
&ldquo;judgement&rdquo;, <em>anterior</em> to any linguistic
framework, e.g., bearing on the choice among frameworks. The choice
among frameworks (and also&mdash;though this is usually not made
explicit&mdash;the choice among explications for a particular
explicandum) must therefore, it seems, take place <em>outside</em> any
rational framework. As George (2012) puts it, for Carnap, practical
deliberation can &ldquo;at best exert a non-rational influence on an
agent who is choosing which framework to adopt&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Talk of rational constraint only has its place within a framework,
once a language and rules of reasoning and inquiry have been settled
upon. For Carnap, this observation is critical in understanding why
traditional philosophical disputes have proven to be so frustratingly
irresolvable and so different from scientific disagreements:
philosophers, unlike scientists, typically dispute about which
framework to adopt, which language to speak, and no facts about the
world can rationally bear on such disagreements. The empirical facts
only come into focus, and talk of rational relevance only gets a grip,
once a particular linguistic framework has been adopted. (2012:
10)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This diagnosis can also take the form of suspecting an infinite
regress in the choice of meta-frameworks required for framework
choice, meta-meta-frameworks for meta-framework choice, and so on
(Steinberger 2016). But as Stein (1992) has argued, a kind of
dialectic can be discerned in the later Carnap, between the cognitive
and practical (or the theoretical and normative) realms. Rather than a
hierarchy of languages in which choices among frameworks or
explications could rationally be articulated, Stein sees a continuous
mutual feedback between the cognitive realm and the practical, in
which values are informed by knowledge, and knowledge requires values
for the choice of framework. As values adjust to what we know, our way
of articulating what we know adjusts to our values; neither side has
the final word&mdash;there is no final word, but only a continuous
adjustment and re-adjustment. (This conception is worked out in more
detail by Carus (2017), who also draws on a newly-discovered
continuation of Carnap&rsquo;s reply to Kaplan (Carnap 2017).)</p>

<p>
Not all formerly metaphysical questions or statements, however, are
appropriately reconstructed as questions or statements concerning
framework <em>proposals</em>. In some cases, after reconstruction, the
metaphysical statements in question might simply turn out to be
descriptive sentences about frameworks which would thus be true or
false on the metalevel (and some metaphysical questions might concern
the truth or falsity of such metasentences). In such a case, making
the (from Carnap&rsquo;s point of view) tacit reference to frameworks
explicit may still pay off, e.g., by helping philosophers avoid
pseudo-debates about what merely <em>seem</em> to be mutually
exclusive metaphysical theses: e.g., while the logicist thesis
&ldquo;Numbers are classes of classes of things&rdquo; seems to rule
out the formalist thesis &ldquo;Numbers belong to a special primitive
kind of objects&rdquo;, their respective syntactic meta-counterparts
&ldquo;Numerical expressions (in the logicist language) are
class-expressions of the second level&rdquo; and &ldquo;Numerical
expressions (in the formalist language) are expressions of the
zero-level&rdquo; are perfectly consistent with each other. The same
holds for the only apparent contradiction between the positivistic
&ldquo;A thing is a complex of sense-data&rdquo; and a more realistic
&ldquo;A thing is a complex of atoms&rdquo;, which turn out to be
compatible, once they have been replaced, respectively, by
&ldquo;Every sentence in which a thing-designation occurs can be
reconstructed as a class of sentences in the phenomenalist
language&rdquo; and &ldquo;Every sentence in which a thing-designation
occurs can be reconstructed as a sentence in the physicalist
language&rdquo;. (These examples are minor modifications of some of
Carnap&rsquo;s own examples in &sect;78 of the <em>Logical
Syntax</em>.)</p>

<p>
In the same sense, some metaphysical sentences might turn out to be
reconstructible as analytic in an object framework, in which case
their analyticity could still be expressed by true sentences on the
metalevel again: e.g., &ldquo;\(\exists x \textit{Prime}(x)\)&rdquo;
(there is a prime number) is analytic in Language II of the
<em>Logical Syntax</em>, hence &ldquo;&lsquo;\(\exists x
\textit{Prime} (x)\)&rsquo; is analytic-in-Language II&rdquo; is true,
whereas &ldquo;&lsquo;\(\exists x\textit{Prime}(x)\)&rsquo; is
analytic-in-Language I&rdquo; is not (as &ldquo;\(\exists
x\textit{Prime}(x)\)&rdquo; is not even well-formed in Language I of
the <em>Logical Syntax</em>, see the supplement on
 <a href="syntax.html"><em>Logical Syntax of Language</em></a>).
 Such analytic existence claims in a framework would be answers to
what Carnap calls &ldquo;internal questions&rdquo; in
&ldquo;Empiricism, Semantics and Ontology&rdquo; (ESO: 378), that is,
&ldquo;questions of the existence of certain entities of the new kind
<em>within the framework</em>&rdquo;, where&mdash;in cases such as
&ldquo;\(\exists x\textit{Prime}(x)\)&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The answers
may be found&hellip; by purely logical methods&rdquo; (ESO: 378). (In
the case of empirical sentences, the answers would need to be found by
empirical methods.) Carnap&rsquo;s interpretation of ontological
claims like \(\exists x\textit{Prime} (x)\) will be addressed in the
next section, where we will also point to some closely related
references in the recent metaphysical literature.</p>

<p>
Whether our suggestion of an &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; successor
project to some aspects of metaphysics or Carnap&rsquo;s own later
partial endorsement of certain traditional metaphysical projects would
or would not ultimately rule out the study and application of
important traditional metaphysical concepts, such as, e.g.,
<em>metaphysical</em> necessity, the <em>Ding an sich</em>, or
absolute spirit, remains an open question&mdash;as does the question
whether metaphysics ultimately has a well-defined subject matter
distinct from those of science, logic, and philosophy of science.</p>

<h3 id="OntoMetaOnto">3. Ontology and Meta-Ontology</h3>

<p>
Ontology was one of the major bones of contention between Carnap and
Quine, second only to the analytic-synthetic distinction (see
supplement on
 <a href="carnap-quine.html">Carnap versus Quine on the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction</a>).
 Carnap&rsquo;s &ldquo;two-level&rdquo; distinction between internal
and external questions (see
 <a href="#ToleMeta">section 2</a>
 above) made the deductive or inductive justification of ontological
statements (existence statements) an internal matter, while external
questions concerned mainly pragmatic choices among language
frameworks. For Quine, in contrast, there were only internal
questions; no standpoint external to the &ldquo;conceptual
scheme&rdquo; we find ourselves &ldquo;within&rdquo; was available, in
his view, from which one could make a choice among such schemes. He
acknowledged a distinction between descriptive and normative
sentences, but considered the latter to be internal to a conceptual
scheme in this sense as well; he rejected&mdash;or did not see (Creath
1994)&mdash;the functionalism in Carnap&rsquo;s view discussed in
 <a href="#ToleMeta">section 2</a>
 above. Semantic ascent was allowed and useful Quine (1960a: &sect;56)
thought, but statements in the metalanguage were restricted to
(translations of) the terms of the conceptual scheme canonically
stated in the scientific object language: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This ascent to a linguistic plane of reference is only a momentary
retreat from the world, for the utility of the truth predicate is
precisely the cancellation of linguistic reference. The truth
predicate is a reminder that, despite a technical ascent to talk of
sentences, our eye is on the world. (Quine 1970a: 12) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Quine (1969) did admit the possibility of different conceptual schemes
with different ontologies, but he saw no possibility of choosing among
these from &ldquo;outside&rdquo;&mdash;while we are
&ldquo;inside&rdquo; our present scheme, we have no way of stepping
outside it (Quine 1986: 157). As Hintikka (1990) pointed out, this
insistence on the inescapability of our current conceptual scheme
harks back to the &ldquo;universal&rdquo; conception of language of
Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein (van Heijenoort 1967, Goldfarb 1979),
which Carnap had criticized in the <em>Logical Syntax</em> (see
 <a href="#ToleLogiSynt">section 1</a>
 above).</p>

<p>
While Carnap accepts the Quinean maxim that &ldquo;to be is to be the
value of a bound variable&rdquo; (&sect;10 of <em>Meaning and
Necessity</em>) for internal questions or assertions of existence, he
makes these bound variables precise in artificial linguistic
frameworks about which we do have a choice. His resulting approach to
ontological questions, such as &ldquo;What is real?&rdquo; and
&ldquo;What exists?&rdquo;, remained remarkably stable over the course
of his career, as we now briefly survey.</p>

<p>
We start with the <em>Aufbau</em>. Its final Part V concerns
applications of the theory of constitution systems (see supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html#ConsSyst"><em>Aufbau</em></a>)
 to philosophical problems. Carnap&rsquo;s basic idea there is that
the only concepts, objects, and statements that are scientifically
(and hence philosophically) acceptable are those that can be expressed
or denoted by formulas in a constitution system.</p>

<p>
Take, for instance, the concept <em>real</em> (the central focus of
Part V of the <em>Aufbau</em>). On the one hand, there is an empirical
notion of reality that is perfectly acceptable to Carnap, because it
can be defined, e.g., in his phenomenalist constitution system. As far
as physical things are concerned, real ones are those that can be
reconstructed as </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
classes of physical points which are located on connected bundles of
world lines and have a place within the comprehensive four-dimensional
system of the space-time world of physics. (&sect;170) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contradistinction, nonreal physical things are things that bear
some similarities with the real ones but which for which no such place
can be found (e.g., dreams, hallucinations, and the like). This </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
difference between reality and nonreality&hellip; retains its full
meaning even in a constitution system which is based on an
autopsychological basis. (&sect;170) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(The real/nonreal distinction can then be extended from physical
objects to psychological and cultural ones.)</p>

<p>
On the other hand, sometimes philosophers also employ a metaphysical
concept of reality according to which something is real just in case
it exists independently from the cognizing subject. While different
philosophical schools and traditions coincide in their verdicts about
reality in the empirical sense (since these belong ultimately to
empirical science), they diverge about metaphysical reality. For
instance: realism regards physical objects as metaphysically real,
while idealism and phenomenalism do not. These schools &ldquo;agree
within the field of epistemology. Constitution theory represents the
neutral foundation which they have in common&rdquo; (&sect;178),
however, the metaphysical concept of reality that seems to be required
to express their differences <em>cannot</em> be reconstructed in a
constitution system (&sect;176), Carnap argues. And, for similar
reasons, concepts such as <em>thing-in-itself</em> cannot be expressed
by means of formulas in a constitution system either.</p>

<p>
It is very important, therefore, not to mistake Carnap&rsquo;s
phenomenalist constitution system in the <em>Aufbau</em> (see
supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html"><em>Aufbau</em></a>)
 for some form of metaphysical phenomenalism: the former is a
linguistic system, the latter is (or, in Carnap&rsquo;s view, merely
seems to be) a thesis; the former constitutes one particular way of
expressing the &ldquo;neutral foundation&rdquo; that the latter shares
with its metaphysical rivals. Carnap calls this property of his
phenomenalist system &ldquo;methodological solipsism&rdquo; in order
to distinguish it from a solipsism that claims other subjects not to
be &ldquo;real&rdquo; in the metaphysical sense. Similarly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is occasionally said that there is a (usually tacit) realism at the
bottom of the practical procedures of the empirical sciences,
especially of physics. However, we must here clearly distinguish
between a certain kind of language usage and the assertion of a
thesis. The realistic orientation of the physicist shows itself
primarily in the use of realistic language; this is practical and
justifiable. (&sect;178)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This clearly anticipates Carnap&rsquo;s later distinction between
internal and external questions in &ldquo;Empiricism, Semantic, and
Ontology&rdquo;. (Without using the terminology, he already
distinguishes the two kinds of questions in an example in &sect;175 of
the <em>Aufbau</em>.)</p>

<p>
So far as Carnap&rsquo;s later work in the philosophy of science is
concerned, Section IV of &ldquo;The Methodological Character of
Theoretical Concepts&rdquo; (1956) contains a very similar discussion
of different senses of &ldquo;reality&rdquo; to that in the
<em>Aufbau</em>. The same holds for the second (1974) edition of
<em>Philosophical Foundations of Physics</em> (crucially revised with
respect to this very issue shortly before his death in 1970):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is obvious that there is a difference between the meanings of the
instrumentalist and the realist ways of speaking. My own view, which I
shall not elaborate here, is essentially this. I believe that the
question should not be discussed in the form: &ldquo;Are theoretical
entities real?&rdquo; but rather in the form: &ldquo;Shall we prefer a
language of physics (and of science in general) that contains
theoretical terms, or a language without such terms?&rdquo; From this
point of view the question becomes one of preference and practical
decision. (Carnap 1974: 256; A footnote at the end of this paragraph,
absent in the first edition, cites ESO)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The same can be said about Carnap&rsquo;s approach to matters of
&ldquo;reality&rdquo; or &ldquo;existence&rdquo; as these expressions
occur in semantics, as he makes clear in <em>Meaning and
Necessity</em> (see 1956b: 54f) and, most explicitly, in
&ldquo;Empiricism, Semantics and Ontology&rdquo;. The relevant
question is this: does the very use of semantics &ldquo;commit&rdquo;
one to the existence (in some sense) of the objects referred to, or
quantified over, in a language (whether in the object language or in
the semantic metalanguage)? The semantics of almost any reasonably
equipped mathematical object language would, in that case, commit its
user (e.g., the physicist) to an extensive universe of abstract
objects, as would using a semantic metalanguage in which one speaks of
extensions or intensions understood as sets or classes of some kind.
The response of most scientifically-minded philosophers at the time,
ranging from Neurath to Quine, was to approach semantics with
suspicion and to insist that, if used at all, it be interpreted in
purely nominalistic or reductionist terms, dispensing with abstract
objects (Carus 2019). One of the most vocal critics was Gilbert Ryle
(1949), who accused Carnap of naively projecting the semantic relation
between a proper name and its bearer onto all discourse, assuming
there must be entities corresponding to all parts of speech just as
there are to proper names, and so embracing what Ryle called the
&ldquo;&lsquo;Fido&rsquo;-Fido principle&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Carnap addressed this question upfront in &ldquo;Empiricism,
Semantics, and Ontology&rdquo; (see
 <a href="#ToleMeta">section 2</a>.
 above). He denied that the adoption and use of a language implies a
belief in the entities it posits (analogous to van Fraassen&rsquo;s
later constructive empiricism denying that the acceptance of a theory
implies a belief in its unobservable portions). There is simply no
question of fact or reality involved, just the practical question
whether to use a certain tool. Since the decision to use a certain
language is not a theory or claim, no form of inference can (for
Carnap, a non-cognitivist about normative statements; see
 <a href="#ToleMeta">section 2</a>
 above) derive from that decision any conclusion about the existence
of the entities referred to in some extra-linguistic sense. In fact,
the thesis that some thing is trans- or extra-linguistically real
cannot even be formulated in the language whose vocabulary contains a
name of that thing. The &ldquo;&lsquo;Fido&rsquo;-Fido
principle&rdquo; is not a theory, as Ryle claims; it is simply
&ldquo;the practical decision to accept certain frameworks&rdquo;
(ESO: Section 4). This position, as Carnap points out, is entirely
consistent with the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s rejection of all questions
of existence, outside an agreed language, as pseudo-questions. And
rejecting the question is to be sharply distinguished, he reminds his
readers, from nominalism and skepticism, which <em>deny</em> the
existence of the entities in question. This was just as bad as
affirming them, in Carnap&rsquo;s view. The Vienna Circle position
rejects the question itself as underspecified. An imaginary dialogue
between a nominalist and a realist (Section 4 of ESO) results in a
stand-off, with neither party recognizing the arguments of the other
as relevant. Carnap is therefore compelled, he says, to regard the
question of ultimate &ldquo;reality&rdquo; at issue between them as a
pseudo-question, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
until both parties to the controversy offer a common interpretation of
the question as a cognitive question; this would involve an indication
of possible evidence regarded as relevant by both sides. (ibid.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Where does that leave matters of <em>existence</em>, then? As in the
<em>Aufbau</em> (see above), Carnap distinguishes two senses of
&ldquo;exist&rdquo;. Strictly speaking, we can only use it
<em>internally</em>, he says, that is, relative to a language
framework. For instance, in a suitably defined mathematical framework,
the existence of numbers, prime numbers, square numbers,&hellip; is
analytic in the framework, since the corresponding existential
statements are provable by the deductive rules of the framework (see
the discussion in the last section; and compare Ebbs 2017: Chapter 2).
Similarly, in a framework for empirical science, existence claims for
empirical entities can be formulated in the framework, these existence
claims can be justified based on observations that can be described in
the framework, and the manner in which these existence claims are
justified can be explicated by methods of inductive reasoning that
belong to the framework. Some philosophers, however, have also used
&ldquo;exist&rdquo; <em>externally.</em> They are not interested in
the (internal) question whether, say, numbers exist in the language of
Zermelo-Frankel set theory&mdash;the answer is trivial. They want to
know whether the system of numbers <em>really</em> exists as a whole,
in some general, extra-linguistic sense, independently of us, beyond
the realm of human whim and convention. As we saw, Carnap rejects such
external questions, at least at face value, and suggests they be
reinterpreted or explicated as questions about the desirability of
alternative languages or frameworks, and their suitability to
specified purposes (Flocke forthcoming-a). But this is a very
different kind of discussion from traditional (or now once again
prevalent) wrangles about ontology; the question is no longer about
&ldquo;what there is&rdquo; but about the relative merit of different
tools for different purposes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; the choice of a certain language structure and, in
particular, the decision to use certain types of variables is a
practical decision like the choice of an instrument; it depends
chiefly upon the purposes for which the instrument&mdash;here the
language&mdash;is intended to be used and upon the properties of the
instrument. I admit that the choice of a language suitable for the
purposes of physics and mathematics involves problems quite different
from those involved in the choice of a suitable motor for a freight
airplane; but, in a sense, both are engineering problems, and I fail
to see why metaphysics should enter into the first any more than into
the second. (Carnap 1947: &sect;10)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this way, Carnap transforms external questions about &ldquo;the
existence or reality of <em>the system of entities as a
whole</em>&rdquo; (ESO: section 2)&mdash;the existence or reality of
the system of things, the system of thing properties, the system of
numbers, the system of propositions and other abstract entities in
semantics&mdash;into the practical question whether a certain
linguistic framework is to be adopted for a certain purpose. The
<em>acceptance of a kind of entities</em> consists in the
<em>acceptance of a framework</em> (see section 3 of
ESO)&mdash;choosing suitable general terms (&ldquo;universal
words&rdquo; in the language of &sect;76 of the <em>Logical
Syntax</em>), such as &ldquo;thing&rdquo;, &ldquo;thing
property&rdquo;, &ldquo;number&rdquo;, and &ldquo;proposition&rdquo;,
and the required sorts of variables for the quantifiers (and, of
course, rules of different kinds).</p>

<p>
In recent years, Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of ontology has
received a lot of attention from metaphysicians who are interested in
meta-ontology (discourse <em>about</em> ontology) and deflationism
about ontology (which holds that ontological questions are
unsubstantial or merely verbal). Many of these authors aim to untangle
the ontological internal versus external debate from the semantic
analytic versus synthetic debate, in order not to be affected by
Quine&rsquo;s criticism (see supplement on
 <a href="carnap-quine.html">Carnap versus Quine on the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction</a>):
 for Quine had thought that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One conspicuous consequence of Carnap&rsquo;s belief in this dichotomy
[analytic-vs.-synthetic] may be seen in the attitude towards
philosophical issues, e.g., as to what there is. It is only by
assuming the cleavage between analytic and synthetic truths that he is
able, e.g., to declare the problem of universals to be a matter not of
theory but of linguistic decision. (Quine 1960b: Section 10) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Carnap (ESO) himself points out that internal questions may be
answered on either analytic <em>or</em> empirical grounds, so the
concept of analyticity is not always required to address internal
existence questions. (Besides, Carnap leaves open the possibility of a
language without analytic sentences&mdash;he thinks such a language
would be highly impractical, but it is certainly conceivable.) See
Thomasson (2014: Chapter 7) for more on this, see, e.g., Yablo (1998)
for a proposal for how to disentangle the internal-external
distinction from the analytic-synthetic distinction, and see Gallois
(1998) for a criticism of Yablo&rsquo;s proposal. In any case, since
the set of analytic sentences in a Carnapian framework is a
&ldquo;by-product&rdquo; of Carnap&rsquo;s understanding of artificial
linguistic frameworks, metaphysicians need to modify that
understanding of analyticity or framework if they want to avoid the
issue of analyticity when addressing external questions. See Yablo
(1998, 2014), Thomasson (2009, 2014, 2016), Hirsch (2011), Hofweber
(2016), Section 5 of Berto and Plebani (2015), and the edited
collections of articles in Chalmers, Manley and Wasserman (2009) and
Blatti and Lapointe (2016) for representative contributions to
metaontological deflationism and related ongoing debates on ontology
in the Carnapian tradition.</p>

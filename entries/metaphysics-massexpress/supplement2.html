<h2>Supplement 2: Sums and Ordinary Objects</h2>

<h3>2.1 Coincidentalism</h3>

<p>If one is a realist about both ordinary objects and sums, and takes
parsimony about ontological categories seriously, then coincidentalism
is an appealing position. While both ordinary objects and sums
(which are also objects) exist, they cannot be identical, since the
clay can both pre-exist the statue it constitutes, and can survive
past the statue being crushed.  Furthermore, the clay (one might
think) cannot lose any parts and persist, yet the statue can survive,
say, the loss of a finger.</p>

<p>
There are other reasons to distinguish &lsquo;mere sums&rsquo; from the ordinary
objects they constitute. Ordinary objects seem to fall under certain
count sortals (e.g., <em>table,
cat</em>) which are associated with certain persistence
conditions. Yet stuff kinds and fusions of fundamental particles do
not fall under commonsense count kind terms. Some water <em>per
se</em> is not identical to pools and droplets and cubes, and a proton
and electron are not identical to the hydrogen atom they constitute
(since their persistence conditions are distinct). The only type of
count-terms which will refer to sums (regardless of their arrangement)
are cooked up technical terms, such
as <em>quantity</em>, <em>fusion</em>, <em>parcel</em>, <em>portion</em>,
<em>hunk</em>, <em>aggregate</em>,
and so on. </p>

<p>
If we allow coincidence, there are many problems (see the 
 entry on 
 <a href="../material-constitution/index.html">material constitution</a> for details.)
 We will discuss just one objection
in any depth&mdash;the so called &lsquo;supervenience objection&rsquo; or &lsquo;grounding
problem&rsquo;, first pointed out by Burke (1992; see also Rea 1997; Sider
2008 and Zimmerman 1995 for more details on this problem). Consider the
putative coincidence of a table and the wood that makes it up. Is the
wood table shaped? Yes. Can the wood support objects? Yes. Is the wood
made out of all the same material the table is? Yes. The wood is
starting to sound a lot like a <em>table</em>.
</p>

<p>
The upshot of this is that if a thing&rsquo;s kind is determined by its
intrinsic properties, then the wood and table should be of the same
kind. How could they differ in kind? The tempting answer is that they
differ in kind because they have different modal properties, that is,
they survive or are destroyed under different circumstances. But
how do we know that they have different modal properties? Because they
are different in kind. The explanation of their difference appears
circular (Zimmerman 1995, pp.&thinsp;87&ndash;90). </p>

<p>
But, &lsquo;colocationists&rsquo; or &lsquo;coincidentalists&rsquo; are happy to bite the
bullet, or make some ameliorating moves (Sider 2008; Rudder Baker 2000,
pp.&thinsp;191&ndash;196). Colocationism does have some salutary
features, as it explains what the constitution relation is&mdash;matter
constitutes ordinary objects by sharing parts with them. The wood makes
up a table, and a table comes into existence by the wood being arranged
in a tablish way.  </p>

<h3>2.2 Ordinary Object Eliminativism</h3>

<p>There are alternatives for a sum theorist who wants to reject
coincidence. Chisholm was convinced that nothing can change parts. But,
since common sense objects, if they exist, change parts, then there
just cannot be any of them. Chisholm holds that ordinary objects, such
as tables and chairs, which appear to change parts, are in fact
successions of lumps of contiguous matter which have all of their parts
essentially. He recommends a paraphrase of talk of ordinary objects
which eliminates them from mention, since he contends that we can say
everything we want to about ordinary objects by only mentioning sums or
pieces of matter (1976, Appendix III). On this view, there really are
no cars, tables, and mountains. The only objects are fundamental
material entities and fusions of them. Chisholm calls ordinary objects
&lsquo;fictions&rsquo; or &lsquo;logical constructions.&rsquo; This solves coincidence, since,
if there are no ordinary objects they cannot very well coincide with
sums. (Chisholm did not believe in 1976 in unrestricted
mereology. He only believed in fusions of matter that are, we could say
roughly, stuck together (1976, p.&thinsp;153). He later changed his position
for interesting reasons. See Steen 2008 for exegesis and critique.)</p>

<p>
So, ordinary objects go somewhat the way of &lsquo;the average man&rsquo;. They
are constructed out of genuine things, but are not themselves genuine.</p>

<p>
Another eliminativistic sum view is Michael Jubien&rsquo;s (1993). What
is distinctive about Jubien&rsquo;s view is that (many) definite
descriptions and proper names (e.g., <em>the dining table</em>, <em>Obama</em>), &ldquo;do not designate at all. Instead they are disguised predicates&hellip;&rdquo; (1993, p.&thinsp;65).</p>

<p>
Strictly speaking, Descartes does not exist. What does exist is stuff,
some which has the property of <em>being-Descartes</em>: The property
of <em>being-Descartes</em> is just a phase of some stuff which is not
essentially Descartes. For Jubien, the only objects that really exist
are masses of stuff.</p><blockquote><p>  Any physical stuff in
spacetime is a <em>thing</em>. <em>The thing</em> is nothing more nor
less than<em> the stuff</em>. (2003, p.&thinsp;9)
</p></blockquote><p>
But Jubien does not restrict his objects via contiguity or
simultaneity, like Chisholm. Jubien agrees with Quine that a physical
object</p><blockquote><p>comprises simply the content, however heterogeneous, of some
portion of space-time, however disconnected and gerrymandered. (Quine 1960,
p.&thinsp;171) </p>
</blockquote><p>
This view also solves, among other things, the paradox of
coincidence:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is hard to deny the intuition that
there is only one thing in the region. But there is no need to go to
extravagant lengths to maintain it. On my view there is but one thing
in the region. It has the property of being a lump of clay. It has the
property of being a statue&hellip;There are no mysteries or extravagances
here&hellip;There are just things and their properties. (Jubien 1993, p.&thinsp;38)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is somewhat nonchalant, since the view entails that there is
some stuff which is the gold in Fort Knox at noon and the mercury on
Mercury at 12:30, and that some stuff has the property of being
Descartes, yet nothing exists which is identical with Descartes. </p>

<p>
While these views do solve problems of coincidence with sums, it could
be argued that they do so at too great a cost, since maintaining that
ordinary objects exist, in addition to sums, is a desiderata if one
wishes one&rsquo;s view to gel with commonsense. </p>

<h3>2.3 Dual Category Views</h3>

<p>Some views seek to maintain the existence of both sums and ordinary
objects, and attempt to ameliorate coincidence by interpreting sums
and ordinary objects as different kinds of entities. Two different
kinds of things in the same place at the same time is often
unproblematic. For example, an object can coincide with its spatial region, or a top
(object) with its spinning (event). </p>

<p>
On Grandy&rsquo;s function view, masses of matter such as some water are mere
sums, and commonsense objects are identified as functions from times to
masses of matter (1975). So, a ring is a relation between times and a
hunk or (if it changes parts) hunks of matter. This has the drawback
that ordinary objects become abstract, among other problems (Zimmerman
1995, p.&thinsp;92). </p>

<p>
There are also views according to which ordinary objects are
disturbances in masses of matter (Karmo 1977) or &lsquo;modes&rsquo; of the masses
(Chisholm 1986, pp.&thinsp;66&ndash;70) or processes that the masses are engaged
in. On these kinds of views, ordinary objects stand to masses in a
similar way that a wave stands to the water it flows through. The wave
is not identical to the portions of water which it flows through&mdash;the
wave is something the water is doing. These are dual-category
views&mdash;masses and processes are both irreducible to anything else.
These are unlike Whitehead&rsquo;s monocategorial process view where
there are only processes (1978).</p>

<p>
One intriguing exposition of this view is found in Toomas Karmo&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Disturbances&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;a stream is a species of disturbance,
where a disturbance is definable as an object or entity found <em>in</em> some other object&mdash;not in
the sense in which a letter may be found in an envelope, or a biscuit
in a tin, but in the sense in which a knot may be in a rope, a wrinkle
in a carpet&hellip;or a bulge in a cylinder. One way of telling whether an
object <em>X</em> is &lsquo;in&rsquo; an object <em>Y</em> in the sense peculiar to
disturbances is to enquire whether <em>X</em> can migrate through <em>Y</em>&hellip;That which
a disturbance is in is its medium; a stream is a disturbance in that
total consignment of water which is now, has at any time in the past
been, or will at any time the future be found in it. The process which
is the flowing of a stream may equally well be described as a
stream&rsquo;s migrating through a quantity of water. (1977, p.&thinsp;147)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ordinary objects are substrate-changing processes which &lsquo;pass
through&rsquo; masses which do not themselves change their parts. A
stream is a disturbance in some water, and a person is a disturbance
which passes through portions of flesh (see also Zimmerman 1995, pp.&thinsp;71&ndash;72, 107&ndash;110). </p>

<p>
Chisholm also seemed to embrace such a view at one time (1986,
pp.&thinsp;66&ndash;70). Only masses are things, and part-changing entities such as a
ship are in fact substrate-changing modes. These modes can &lsquo;move,&rsquo; in a form of substrate-migration similar to Karmo&rsquo;s disturbances which move through a medium:</p>

<blockquote><p>If a substrate is a ship, then it has a
mode which is also a ship. If the substrate ceases to be a ship, and if
the mode does not transfer to another substrate, then <em>that</em> mode ceases to be. And if, in
such a case, the substrate continues to be, then it would have other
modes. (1986, pp.&thinsp;66&ndash;67, italics his)</p></blockquote>

<p>Such an account would have the benefits of analyzing concrete mass
expressions as referring to masses of matter, while also explaining
away coincidence. The coincidence between, say, some clay and a statue
is explained away since these are not two things in the same place at
the same time&mdash;rather, the clay (object) is engaged in the activity
of <em>statueing</em>. But, actually, coincidence is between at
least <em>three</em> candidate entities&mdash;the piece of clay, the clay
itself, and the statue. On this kind of account, since anything other
than sums are activities, then we can say that the clay is
both <em>piecing</em> and <em>statueing</em>. The immediate reply to
this is that such an account replaces the coincidence of objects with
that of processes. The counter-reply is that coincidence of processes,
such as a sphere&rsquo;s spinning and expanding, is benign (Steen 2008, pp.&thinsp;50&ndash;53).</p>

<p>
This account, despite its apparent promise, is underdeveloped, and,
consequently, has had little attention paid to it. One can see,
however, some similarities between this account and Jubien&rsquo;s, were
Jubien&rsquo;s properties (e.g., <em>being-George-Bush</em>) replaced with
activities (e.g., <em>George-Bushing</em>). </p>

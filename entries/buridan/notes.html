<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>  However, the
 significance of such details is beginning to be understood more fully
 by historians through recent prosopographical research. See Courtenay
 (1999; 2004a).</p>

<div id="note-4">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a> Buridan writes that unlike
metaphysics and sciences subordinate to it, &ldquo;theology has for its
principles articles [of faith], which are believed quite apart from
their evidentness, and considers further whatever can be deduced from
such articles&rdquo; [<i>Theologia vero habet pro principiis articulos
creditos absque evidentia et considerat ultra quamcumque ex huiusmodi
articulis possunt deduci</i>] (QM I.2: 4ra-rb).  For discussion, see
Zupko (2003, Chapter 10).  See also Courtenay (2001; 2004), who
prefers to leave such questions open.  Some of the most interesting
research currently being done on Buridan concerns the teaching and
scholarly careers of Arts Masters in mid-fourteenth century Paris.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a> It is easy for modern
readers to misunderstand the relationship of medieval philosophers to
theologians as deferential, thereby confirming our own long-held
prejudices about the so-called &ldquo;Dark Ages&rdquo;. But Hans Thijssen offers a
fine corrective here, based on his extensive study of the primary
sources: &ldquo;At first sight the medieval academic condemnations seem to
exemplify the facile generalization of older textbooks that the Middle
Ages were &lsquo;a millenium in which reason was enchained, thought was
enslaved&rsquo;.  Although probably no one any longer upholds this
unbalanced view, the medieval academic condemnations do appear to the
modern reader as striking manifestations of the limitations exerted by
Christian faith on the thought and teaching of university scholars.
Medieval scholars, however, perceived censure from a different point
of view, namely, as the exercise of teaching authority, rather than as
a restraint on academic freedom&rdquo; (Thijssen 1998: xii).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>  There is also a
commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Politics</em> that has been mistakenly
attributed to Buridan, though it is actually the work of Nicholas of
Vaudemont, a late fourteenth-century Parisian Arts Master who was much
influenced by Buridan. See Fl&uuml;eler (1992, vol. 1, 132&ndash;68)
and Courtenay (2004b).</p>

<div id="note-8">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>  By the beginning of the
fourteenth century, arts masters were no longer teaching grammar at
the University of Paris. The last arts master to compose a treatise on
grammar was Radulphus Brito (d. 1320). What appears to have happened
is that the teaching of grammar was gradually taken over by
quasi-independent colleges and other schools that grew up on the
periphery of the university.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>  Thus, Peter of Spain:
&ldquo;Simple supposition is the taking [<em>acceptio</em>] of a
common term for the universal thing signified by it&rdquo; (Peter of
Spain: Tractatus (called afterwards &lsquo;<em>Summulae
logicales</em>&rsquo;), ed. L. M. de Rijk (Assen: van Gorcum, 1972):
81). Early terminist logicians, it should be mentioned, did not all
agree about the divisions of supposition. Peter, for example, does not
mention material supposition, though William of Sherwood includes it
in his <em>Introductiones in logicam</em>, 5.2 (Norman Kretzmann,
<em>William of Sherwood&rsquo;s &lsquo;Introduction to Logic&rsquo;</em>
(Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1966): 107). See also
the entry on 
 <a href="../peter-spain/index.html">Peter of Spain</a> (Petrus Hispanus) in this
<em>Encyclopedia</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 William of
Ockham, <em>Summa logicae</em> I.68; OPh I: 207. For nominalists such
as Ockham, personal supposition offers a guide to ontology, since a
term can supposit personally only for what exists <em>per se</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 Notice also
that this severs the traditional connection between personal and
material supposition as varieties of proper supposition. For Buridan,
the only proper supposition is personal supposition; all of the others
are strictly speaking improper. Stephen Read has linked Buridan&rsquo;s
position on material supposition as improper with the breakthrough
doctrine&mdash;first fully realized in the work of Buridan&rsquo;s student,
Marsilius of Inghen&mdash;that material supposition is possible only if
materially suppositing terms are significative, or stand for what they
signify. See Read, &ldquo;How is Material Supposition Possible?&rdquo;
in <em>Medieval Philosophy and Theology</em> 8 (1999): 18 and S 7.3.4:
522, where Buridan considers &lsquo;<em>Homo est species</em>&rsquo; as
an instance of the fallacy of equivocation.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 The
qualification, &lsquo;at least in the first instance&rsquo;, is
intended to cover the conventionality of signification beyond these
primary acts of imposition, which are in Buridan&rsquo;s view naturally
determined. He conveys this idea by saying that such concepts are
acquired &lsquo;immediately [<em>statim</em>]&rsquo;, i.e., without
deliberation: &ldquo;from the singular visual cognition there
immediately arises the universal intellectual cognition, and so when we
see this man, we immediately think of [a] man&rdquo; (S 4.5.3: 296).
Nevertheless, it is clear that even the signification commonly and
principally given to the term &lsquo;man&rsquo; could be changed after
the fact if everyone agreed to use it in a different way. The case is
somewhat more complicated at the conceptual level, since it does not
seem open to any individual language-user to change the significance of
his/her concepts at will. But even these can be changed indirectly, as
a result of the dialectical relationship Buridan takes to hold between
concepts and spoken or written languages. Thus, someone who learns from
a book that kangaroos are marsupials does not acquire a new concept,
but augments or modifies the concept he already has.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Not
surprisingly, terms in the propositions of logic are said to occur in
material supposition, since logic concerns the conventional
classification of significant utterances and patterns of reasoning and
persuasion. Its objects are the immediate, rather than the ultimate,
significates of terms. See S 4.3.2: 257&ndash;8.</p>

 A typical
list of positions can be found, e.g., in the <em>Insolubilia</em> of
Thomas Bradwardine, which was written in the 1320s. See the entry on
 <a href="../insolubles/index.html">insolubles</a>

</div>

<div id="note-26">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 Another
solution, which concedes that Socrates&rsquo;s proposition &ldquo;is true and
false at the same time&rdquo;, is rejected as sacrificing too much. The
problem with this theory is that it makes it impossible to give the
contradictory of Socrates&rsquo;s proposition, which means that it has no
proper coordinates in Aristotelian logical space.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>  This is effectively
Thomas Bradwardine&rsquo;s solution to the Liar (see the entry on 
 <a href="../insolubles/index.html">insolubles</a>
in this <em>Encyclopedia</em>). But it was not without
precedent. Among the others who defended Buridan&rsquo;s solution would have
been Bonaventure, who, in the course of discussing one of Augustine&rsquo;s
arguments for the existence of God (<em>Soliloquies</em>
I.15)&mdash;i.e., that if no truth exists, then some truth exists; and
if some truth exists, a First Truth exists&mdash;records the objection
that the first inference fails because no proposition can entail its
own contradictory. Bonaventure agrees, but adds the following
qualification: &ldquo;one must understand that an affirmative
proposition makes a two-fold assertion, one which asserts the
predicate of the subject, and the other which asserts that the
proposition is true &hellip; Contradiction is concerned with the first
type of assertion, not the second. So when it is said that no truth
exists [<em>nulla veritas est</em>], this proposition, insofar as it
denies the predicate of the subject, does not imply its opposite,
which is that some truth exists. But insofar as it asserts itself to
be true, it implies that some truth exists [<em>infert aliquam
veritatem esse</em>]&rdquo; (<em>Quaestiones disputatae de mysterio
Trinitatis</em>, q. 1, a. 1, ad 5; Latin text excerpted in Spade
(1975, 53)). For other advocates of this solution, see Paul Vincent
Spade, &ldquo;<em>Insolubilia</em>&rdquo; in the <em>Cambridge History
of Later Medieval Philosophy</em>: 249.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 Cf. Buridan&rsquo;s
earlier claim that contradiction requires not only the logical form of
contradiction, but the speaker&rsquo;s intention (S 9.7, 2<sup>nd</sup> sophism:
943).</p>

 Buridan&rsquo;s
presentation of this alternative is complicated somewhat by the
doctrinal claim that the &lsquo;nothing&rsquo; signified by &lsquo;A
man is a donkey&rsquo; is not any kind of proposition, but &lsquo;that
a man is a donkey [<em>hominem esse asinum</em>]&rsquo;, which is the
<em>dictum</em> or sentential nominalization of that proposition
(expressed in Latin by the accusative + infinitive construction). In
Buridanian semantics, such a construction supposits for whatever both
the subject and predicate terms of its corresponding proposition
supposit for, provided the proposition is true; otherwise it supposits
for nothing. Gyula Klima remarks that this is how &ldquo;Buridan
manages to assign some credible semantic function to such sentential
nominalizations without having to subscribe to a dubious ontology of
eternal or quasi-eternal <em>enuntiabilia</em>, or <em>complexe
significabilia</em>, distinct from ordinary substances and
accidents&rdquo; (Klima 2001, 844 n. 28); for Buridan&rsquo;s reaction to those who
did seem to subscribe to such an ontology, see 
 <a href="index-2.html#Lan">section 3</a>.
Buridan&rsquo;s sensitivity to the ontological dimensions of the problem
emerges when he says that &ldquo;&lsquo;that a man is a donkey&rsquo;
is nothing, because a man cannot be a donkey [<em>hominem esse asinum
nihil est, eo quod homo non potest esse
asinus</em>]&rdquo;&mdash;which also suffices for its falsity.</p>
</div>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a>
 A further
problem has been drawn to my attention by Paul Spade, in his comments
on an earlier draft of this article: &ldquo;if every proposition
signifies <em>se esse veram</em>, and we&rsquo;re construing the infinitival
expression personally, we&rsquo;ve got a problem. For it the proposition is
<em>false</em>, the infinitival expression has nothing it can signify,
so that the proposition really <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> have any additional
signification at all, contrary to the whole point of the theory&rdquo;.
If Buridan was aware of this as an additional problem for the first
solution, he does not mention it.</p>

 As Hughes
(1982, 169) has suggested, the force of &lsquo;virtually&rsquo; in
&lsquo;virtually implies&rsquo; is that the second proposition would be
implied by the first only if the first is actually formulated.
This emerges in a closing comment on the sophism in which Buridan
remarks, &ldquo;perfecting this solution, we have to say that every
proposition, adding <em>that it exists</em>, implies that it is
true&rdquo; (S 9.8, 7<sup>th</sup> sophism: 970).</p>

 Of course,
this holds only for affirmative propositions. Negative propositions are
true if their subject and predicate terms <em>do not</em> stand for the
same thing or things.</p>

 For a helpful
overview, see Thijssen (1998, 2): &ldquo;In many official documents and
other texts, philosophers and theologians were exhorted not to cross
the boundaries of their own fields&mdash;a reference to
<em>Proverbs</em> 22:28&mdash;and not to become theologizing
philosophers and philosophizing theologians&rdquo;.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-35">35.</a>  Precedents for
reading &lsquo;theology&rsquo; as &lsquo;metaphysics&rsquo; in this
context&mdash;which is somewhat obscured by the fact that the
incunabular edition of Buridan&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em> commentary
erroneously gives &lsquo;<em>metaphysica totalis</em>&rsquo; for
&lsquo;<em>mathematica totalis</em>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<em>metaphysicus</em>&rsquo; for
&lsquo;<em>mathematicus</em>&rsquo; in the 23<sup>rd</sup> and
25<sup>th</sup> lines of folio 34ra&mdash;can be found in Robert
Kilwardby, <em>De Ortu Scientiarum</em> LXVI.655 and Thomas
Aquinas, <em>In De trin</em>. V, a. 4, as well as in Albert the
Great.</p>

 Thomas puts
this same distinction in terms of the <em>ratio</em> or concept under
which the subject is considered: &ldquo;although philosophy considers
all existing things according to concepts [<em>rationes</em>] taken
from creatures, there must be another science, which considers existing
things according to concepts [<em>rationes</em>] taken from the
inspiration of the divine light&rdquo; (<em>In I Sent</em>., Prol.,
q.1, a.1, ad 1; cf. <em>In De trin</em>., q.5, a.1&ndash;4).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-37">37.</a>
 For this
reason as well, Buridan never tries to compare the methods of
philosophy and theology, let alone to suggest how the former might be
subsumed by the latter. He is aware of the possibility of rapprochement
between the two sides, if only by its absence from the Parisian scene:
&ldquo;it seems to me that this question [about whether it is possible
for demonstration to cross disciplinary lines] is difficult first
because there has been exceedingly little discussion between the
philosophers and the doctors [of theology], and second because it
touches on the means of distinguishing the sciences, and it is even
more difficult to assign whence, and in what way, the sciences
originally received their distinction&rdquo; (<em>QAnPo</em> I.23).</p>

 Buridan&rsquo;s
allusions to Plato on universals are fairly typical: see, e.g., QM
VII.15: 50va-vb, and de Rijk (1992). On other topics, however, he is
sometimes suspicious about whether a position handed down as Plato&rsquo;s is
in fact Plato&rsquo;s. For example, after disposing of an argument introduced
&ldquo;on the authority of Plato&rdquo; for the role of separate
substances in the generation of living things, he concludes, &ldquo;and
so in this way Plato&rsquo;s opinion is destroyed&mdash;if he in fact had
an opinion of the sort we have ascribed to him&rdquo; (QM VII.9: 47ra).

 See Peter
King, &ldquo;John Buridan&rsquo;s Solution to the Problem of
Universals&rdquo; in Thijssen and Zupko (2001, 1&ndash;27). King argues that
Buridan&rsquo;s nominalism has three interrelated aspects: (1) the
ontological thesis that there are no non-individual entities in the
world; (2) the psychological thesis that some concepts, though
metaphysically particular, can represent more than one individual
thing; and (3) the semantic thesis that such concepts also function as
common names in Mental Language.</p>

 Cf. QIP 4:
138, ll. 565&ndash;566. Buridan&rsquo;s treatment of transcendental terms is
similar: &ldquo;the subject of metaphysics is being, that is, the term
&lsquo;being&rsquo;&rdquo; (QIP 3: 135, ll. 449&ndash;450).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-43">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-43">43.</a>  Buridan even regards
it as conventional that we treat universals as second-intentional
names (TDUI: 145&ndash;146). Universals are substances in the second mode of
substance only, i.e., &ldquo;they are terms in the category of
substance&rdquo; (QIP 4: 140, ll. 635&ndash;636); likewise,
&ldquo;&lsquo;universal&rsquo; is a transcendent name&rdquo;, and such
names occur on one level only (TDUI: 147); and as a form, a universal
is a second intention (TDUI: 148)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-44">44.</a>
 Note also
that the differences in universal names do not correspond to any real
diversity in the things signified by those names, &ldquo;but in the
medium through which we arrive at the concepts by which those names are
imposed&rdquo; (QIP 11: 173, ll. 1853&ndash;1854). The &ldquo;medium&rdquo;
is the more common or general concept, e.g., of sensing, from which the
common concept of everything sensitive is formed, and names such as
&lsquo;animal&rsquo; are imposed (QIP 11: 173, ll. 1847&ndash;1850).</p>

 That the
object of knowledge is a <em>complexum</em>, or proposition, rather
than an <em>incomplexum</em>, or a term, follows from the fact that we
can believe or know only what can be true or false, and only
propositions can be true or false.</p>

 Thus, for
Aristotle, the thrown javelin does not continue to move because of any
force inside the javelin (which is, after all, an inanimate object),
but because its movement through the air creates a vacuum behind it
which the surrounding air rushes in to fill, thereby pushing the
javelin forward.</p>

 We do not
know precisely where Buridan got the idea of impetus, but a less
sophisticated notion of impressed forced can be found in Avicenna&rsquo;s
doctrine of <em>mayl</em> (inclination). In this he was possibly
influenced by Philoponus, who was developing the Stoic notion of
<em>horm&eacute;</em> (impulse). For discussion, see Zupko (1997).</p>

 We can also
see this in his defense of the sufficiency of efficient causality in
explanations of natural phenomena, which eventually led to the eclipse
of final causality several centuries later. For discussion, see Des
Chene (1996, 186&ndash;7).</p>

 It would not
be like Buridan to rule out theological considerations completely.
Indeed, he sometimes confronts theological issues with what can only be
described as intellectual playfulness. Edith Sylla nicely describes his
method here: &ldquo;Buridan does not exclude theology from physics,
along the lines of Boethius of Dacia, nor does he overwhelm physics
with theology, along the lines of today&rsquo;s Creationists. Rather, in a
moderate way, Buridan introduces theological truths into the body of
Aristotelian physics and then shows, plausibly, that to draw inferences
from physics plus theology, it is necessary to add other hypotheses
[e.g., to assume a reference frame for extra-cosmic motion, or a
&lsquo;time&rsquo; to measure duration before creation]&mdash;to beg
the human intellect&rdquo; (Sylla, &ldquo;<em>Ideo quasi mendicare
oportet intellectum humanum</em>: The Role of Theology in John
Buridan&rsquo;s Natural Philosophy,&rdquo; in Thijssen and Zupko (2000,
244&ndash;5)).</p>

 The example is associated with Buridan by Spinoza,
<em>Ethica</em> (completed 1676) II, scholium to Proposition 49.  But
by that time, it was already a philosophical commonplace.  We find a
similar use of Buridan&rsquo;s Ass eighty years earlier, in the <em>Logicae
Assertiones</em> (1597) of Johann Vitus Sch&ouml;nlin, Fiacrius
Carpentarius, Georg Gutbrott, and Friedrich Faust, section 43:
&ldquo;What arises from fear arises freely; nor is any freedom taken
away by the passions of the soul, though they threaten it and
strengthen the will &lt;to resist&gt;.  But whoever attributes freedom
to a brute animal is mistaken, whether in the case where it is not
inclined to walk to one place more than another, or of the kind raised
by Buridan&rsquo;s ass, where a hungry animal is placed between two equally
good sources of food&rdquo; [&ldquo;<em>Quae ex metu fiunt, libere
fiunt, nec passiones animae ullae libertatem tollunt, licet eam
imminuant , et voluntarium augeant.  Errat vero quisquis bruto
libertatem tribuit, vel eo casu, quando non allicitur ad ambulandum
magis hac loci quam alia parte, aut cum famelicum inter duo aeque bona
constituitur pabula, cuiusmodi fertur fuisse asinus
Buridani</em>&rdquo;].  I am grateful to Miroslav Hanke for bringing
this source to my attention.</p>

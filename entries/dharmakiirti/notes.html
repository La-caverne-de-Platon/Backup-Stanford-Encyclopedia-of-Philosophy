 For introductions to Dharmak&#299;rti's life and thought, see
Stcherbatsky (1930; 1932), Mookerjee (1935), Tosaki (1979; 1985), van
Bijlert (1989), Dreyfus (1997), Steinkellner (1998; 2013), Tillemans
(1999), Dunne (2004). See also Hattori (1968) on Dign&#257;ga's life
and thought, and Siderits (2007, ch. 10) on &ldquo;the school of
Dign&#257;ga&rdquo;, i.e., Buddhist Epistemology. The
<em>Tarkabh&#257;&#7779;&#257;</em> of Mok&#7779;&#257;karagupta, an
11<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup> century Indian Buddhist text
introducing Dharmak&#299;rti's thought, is translated into English and
extensively explained in Kajiyama (1966). Steinkellner and Much (1995)
gives an overview of the Sanskrit and Tibetan texts, critical
editions, and modern translations of the works of Dharmak&#299;rti and
his commentators. A&nbsp;complete introduction to Dharmak&#299;rti's
philosophy and&nbsp;bibliographical details on&nbsp;secondary
literature is found in Eltschinger (2010). See also Mimaki (1976) on
later Dharmak&#299;rtian philosophers; on Tibetan developments of
Dharmak&#299;rti's philosophy, see van der Kuijp (1983), Dreyfus
(1997), Tillemans (1999), Hugon (2008), as well as the article on

 See S&#257;&#7749;k&#7771;ty&#257;yana (1938, p. vi). It may be that
the philosopher Dharmak&#299;rti was also the Indian poet known as
Dharmak&#299;rti, in which case we also have a rather haunting poem
showing bitterness at being unrecognized :</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Valm&#299;ki dammed the sea with rocks
<br />
put into place by monkeys,
<br />
and Vy&#257;sa filled it with arrows shot by P&#257;rtha;
<br />
yet neither is suspected of hyperbole.
<br />
On the other hand, I weigh both word and sense
<br />
and yet the public sneers and scorns my work.
<br />
O Reputation, I salute thee!.</p>
</blockquote>

 The argument is essentially as follows: The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang,
who was in India from 629 to 645 C.E., did not include
Dharmak&#299;rti in his enumeration of famous philosophers; however,
if Dharmak&#299;rti had been known at that time, Xuanzang would most
probably have mentioned him. Yijing, who was in India (and
N&#257;land&#257; in particular) from 675&ndash;685, did mention
Dharmak&#299;rti. Dharmak&#299;rti thus achieved recognition in the
interval between the two pilgrims' stays, near the end of his life.

 See Tillemans (2000, p. xiii&ndash;xv). Krasser (2012) begins with a
discussion of the debt that Dharmak&#299;rti seems to have had to
Bh&#257;viveka in his formulation of the apoha theory. The matter was
investigated in Tillemans (2011b), reprinted as chapter 6 in Tillemans
(2016). Krasser (2012) marshalled much more evidence in favor of a
connection with Bh&#257;viveka and hence the mid-sixth century dates
for Dharmak&#299;rti. His conclusion (see p. 558): my caution and
agnosticism were unnecessary.</p>

 For a passage from Dharmak&#299;rti and Manorthanandin using this
&ldquo;one-many&rdquo; argumentation against universals, see Tillemans
(2000, p. 21&ndash;22). The same argument figures in the corresponding
section in <em>Pram&#257;&#7751;avini&#347;caya</em> III. It is
enlarged in the <em>Pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;rttika</em> commentary of
Praj&ntilde;&#257;karagupta to refute not only universals, but time,
ether, and other other pseudo-entities postulated by Brahmanical
schools.</p>

 Hattori (1968, p.80): &ldquo;The concept of <em>artha-kriy&#257;</em>
is unfamiliar to Dign&#257;ga.&rdquo; A brief word on what
Dharmak&#299;rti's idea of <em>arthakriy&#257;</em> is not. The
Dharmak&#299;rtian term is sometimes unpacked by commentators in terms
of human goals&mdash;e.g., fire has the power to heat up one's food.
This sort of gloss is then sometimes taken by modern scholarship as an
indication of an odd type of pragmatism in Dharmak&#299;rti, as if
what particular things are is just what they are used for by
humankind. In fact, it is highly unlikely that such
&ldquo;pragmatism&rdquo; is to be found here:
<em>&#257;rthakriy&#257;samartha</em> often refers to purely physical
or biological powers, such seeds producing sprouts, or to the powers
of mental states to engender other such states or actions. The basic
point of Dharmak&#299;rti's idea of powers does not seem to be
pragmatic or specifically oriented towards the accomplishment of human
goals. It is more general: all things that exist must have powers
(<em>&#347;akti, samartha</em>) to cause something else to occur,
whatever that might be, relevant to human life or not.</p>

 Causal relations, like all relations according to Dharmak&#299;rti,
are not themselves real entities (<em>vastu; bh&#257;va</em>). The
argumentation in his <em>Sambandhapar&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</em> and
<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;rttikasvav&#7771;tti</em> ad
I.236&ndash;237 against real relations turns on one-many problems
similar to those raised in connection with universals: if there is a
relation <em>R</em> between relata <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, is
<em>R</em> identical with <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, or is it a
different entity from <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>? Although causality
(as we shall see) is <em>the</em> recurring principle&nbsp;in
Dharmak&#299;rti's philosophy of logic and philosophy of language, his
metaphysics admits only of discrete particulars&mdash;relations
linking several relata, just like&nbsp;universal properties that are
instantiated in several things, cannot ultimately&nbsp;have
any&nbsp;place in his nominalist ontology. See Frauwallner (1934) for
a translation of the <em>Sambandhapar&#299;k&#7779;&#257;</em>; see
also Eltschinger (2007, ch. 3) on Dharmak&#299;rti's rejection of a
real signifier-signified relation.</p>

 These are later notions found, e.g., in Mok&#7779;&#257;karagupta.
They do however show that both aspects of Dharmak&#299;rti's
philosophy&mdash;viz. his nominalism and his position on
impermanence&mdash;involve the rejection of universals. See
&sect;7.1.2 in Kajiyama (1966).</p>

 The argument figures in the
<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;rttika</em>&nbsp;but is not an original
idea of Dharmak&#299;rti, as it goes back at least to the
<em>Abhidharmako&#347;abh&#257;&#7779;ya</em> of Vasubandhu (fifth
century C.E.), where it is presented in considerable detail. See
Mimaki (1976, p. 32 and n. 113). The term <em>vin&#257;&#347;itva</em>
(&ldquo;perishing&rdquo;, &ldquo;perishability&rdquo;) has been
interpreted by all major modern writers as showing the reason in an
argument for momentariness, as if the argument was that things are
momentary&nbsp;<em>because</em> they perish spontaneously. However, as
Sakai (2011, n. 2) shows convincingly, the term
<em>vin&#257;&#347;itv&#257;num&#257;na</em> poses problems, as it is
essentially an invention of Frauwallner&nbsp;and only incidentally
attested in a passage of the commentator Kar&#7751;akagomin. Following
Sakai, it looks like the ablative rendering of the Sanskrit compound
<em>vin&#257;&#347;itv&#257;num&#257;na</em> (&ldquo;inference [of
momentariness] from perishing&rdquo;) is wrong; a simple genitive
(&ldquo;inference of perishing&rdquo;) reflects better
Kar&#7751;akagomin's own understanding.</p>

 To update things, the basic point would be that while petrol may
cause your car to run, it is not strictly speaking the absence of
petrol that causes it to sputter and stop, as that absence doesn't
really exist. It is rather the presence of something like the
petrol-less air in your tank that is causally efficacious. In the
Dharmak&#299;rtian jargon, an absence of <em>x</em> is to be analyzed
as a non-perception of <em>x</em> (<em>anupalabhi</em>), and that is
in turn to be unpacked as being a perception of something else
(<em>anyopalabdhi)</em> lacking <em>x</em>. The idea is developed at
length in the second chapter of
<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;avini&#347;caya</em>. See Steinkellner (1973;
1979) for text and translation. For an explanation of
Dharmak&#299;rti's theory of non-perception along with main textual
sources, see Keira (2004, p. 52&ndash;64). See also Kellner (2001;
2003), Tillemans (1999, ch. 7) on aspects of the theory, Stcherbatsky
(1932) for a translation of Dharmak&#299;rti and Dharmottara's
treatment of non-perception in the second chapter of
<em>Ny&#257;yabindu</em> and
<em>Ny&#257;yabindu&#7789;&#299;k&#257;.</em></p>

 There is little sympathy for such things in other Buddhist schools,
too. We also find the common-sense empirical argument being used
against &ldquo;bare entities&rdquo; in N&#257;g&#257;rjuna's
<em>M&#363;lamadhyamakak&#257;rik&#257;</em> V.2.:</p>

 On tropes see the entry in this encyclopedia. Goodman (2004) develops
a trope-theory of the dharmas in the <em>Abhidharmako&#347;a</em>. It
looks applicable in the case of Dharmak&#299;rti and Dign&#257;ga,
too. See also Ganeri (2001, p. 101&ndash;102). For an interpretation
of Dign&#257;ga as holding a theory of bare particulars, see Arnold

 Arguably, there is also a serious philosophical consequence that
faces quidditism generally and that Dharmak&#299;rti's causal position
would avoid. This is a problem that is known as the &ldquo;humility
problem,&rdquo;&nbsp;in reference to Kant's position of epistemic
humility, viz., that people only know phenomena and not things in
themselves. Any philosophy that holds that <em>what</em> something is
is a matter of its intrinsic properties, as distinguishable from its
causal properties, is potentially confronted with the problem that the
intrinsic properties like blueness, fireness, etc., could remain the
same or differ independently of the causal. Thus some things might
have the intrinsic property&nbsp;fireness, and some might have a
different one, i.e., fireness*, even though they all had exactly the
same causal powers. And in that case&nbsp;it is difficult to explain
how anyone could ever differentiate between&nbsp;intrinsic natures
such as fireness and fireness*. More generally, it is not clear how
anyone could know intrinsic natures of things in the world at all.
Note that Dharmak&#299;rtian thinkers could not sanguinely accept that
reality would have such unknowable intrinsic natures. Indeed,
epistemic humility would be a consequence they must avoid, in that for
them it is crucial that particulars, being objects of perception,
should be in principle knowable. Frank Jackson <em>(From Metaphysics
to Ethics: a Defence of Conceptual Analysis.</em> Oxford: Clarendon
Press, 2000 p. 23&ndash;24) summarizes the humility problem for
quidditism. See also Rae Langton, &ldquo;Elusive Knowledge of Things
in Themselves,&rdquo; <em>Australasian Journal of Philosophy</em>

 The idea of &ldquo;connections due to essential natures&rdquo;
(<em>svabh&#257;vapratibandha</em>) is also one of Dharmak&#299;rti's
key innovations, not found in Dign&#257;ga. See Steinkellner (1971),
Oetke (1991), Katsura (1992). &ldquo;Essential natures&rdquo;
(<em>svabh&#257;va</em>) are regularly described in Buddhist
philosophy as properties that a thing cannot lose and still remain
what it is. See, e.g., Candrak&#299;rti's <em>Prasannapad&#257;</em>
(ed. L. de la Vall&eacute;e Poussin, Osnabr&uuml;ck: Biblio Verlag,
1970) 241.8&ndash;9:</p>

 This is, in part, because Indian philosophy has no truck with
propositions when&nbsp;understood as&nbsp;mind-independent, abstract,
real (and eternal) entities that are (like Fregean
&ldquo;Thoughts&rdquo;) what they are anyway, irrespective of people's
cognitive processes at given times. The point has been rightly
stressed to me by Mark Siderits. On propositions, see the article on

 One of the more important innovations Dharmak&#299;rti and his school
made in the Buddhist philosophy of logic was to insist that
understanding of universal generalizations had to be certain
(<em>ni&#347;caya</em>) or, in other terms, that generalizations had
to be &ldquo;ascertained&rdquo; (<em>ni&#347;cita</em>). The earlier
commentator on Dign&#257;ga, &#298;&#347;varasena (sixth century), had
said&nbsp;that we could claim a generalization held on the basis of
our &ldquo;simply not seeing&rdquo; (<em>adar&#347;anam&#257;tra</em>)
any counterexamples. Dharmak&#299;rti argued vociferously that this
was not Dign&#257;ga's position and that the epistemic bar had to be
higher. In fact, it is more likely that the much-maligned
&#298;&#347;varasena got Dign&#257;ga largely right&nbsp;and that the
introduction of &ldquo;ascertainment&rdquo; into the picture is
Dharmak&#299;rti's innovation for philosophical reasons. On
Dharmak&#299;rti's introduction of the term <em>ni&#347;caya</em> into
the theory of good reasons, see Steinkellner (1988), Dunne (2004, p.
148 et sq.).</p>

<em>kalpan&#257;</em>: &ldquo;conceptual thought is that which is
linked to names, classes and other [linguistic forms].&rdquo;
Dharmak&#299;rti in <em>Ny&#257;yabindu</em> I.5 reformulates:</p>

<blockquote>

 A different requirement for understanding to be a genuine source of
knowledge&mdash;indeed many would say a second criterion besides
&ldquo;reliability&rdquo;&mdash;is that it be new. This figures in
<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;rttika</em> II.5: &ldquo;Or, it
illuminates what has not been previously known&rdquo;
(<em>aj&ntilde;at&#257;rthaprak&#257;&#347;o v&#257;</em>). Thus,
memory, or even the second moment of a perception, is disqualified as
a source of knowledge in that it is dependent on a previous
understanding&mdash;the fundamental intuition seems to be that what is
dependent in this way cannot itself be genuine knowledge but is only
parasitical upon it. Cf. Katsura (1984, p. 224): &ldquo;Furthermore,
according to Dharmak&#299;rti, the object of
<em>pram&#257;&#7751;a</em> should be something new. This idea is
probably derived from a sort of common sense belief that knowledge is
meaningless unless it contains some new information.&rdquo; The
Buddhist scholastic literature exhibits considerable
divergence&nbsp;on how these two Dharmak&#299;rtian requirements
should be taken. Should &ldquo;reliability&rdquo; and
&ldquo;newness&rdquo; be conjoined (e.g., as the Tibetan dGe lugs
scholastic maintains, see Dreyfus (1997)), or do they treat of
different levels of understanding, conventional and ultimate (e.g., as
in Praj&ntilde;&#257;karagupta's commentary to
<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;rttika</em> II.5)? An historical
explanation for the two is that of Krasser (2001), who argues that the
second requirement,&ldquo;newness,&rdquo; is a direct borrowing from
the non-Buddhist M&#299;m&#257;&#7747;saka school and is not a
specifically Buddhist philosophical position at all,
being&nbsp;adopted essentially&nbsp;for strategic reasons. See also
Kataoka (2003) on the newness requirement in the
M&#299;m&#257;&#7747;saka definition and the general acceptance of
this requirement in the philosophical milieu in which Dharmak&#299;rti
lived.</p>

 See&nbsp;Dign&#257;ga's&nbsp;<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;asamuccayav&#7771;tti&nbsp;</em>
 on I.9a (translated in Hattori 1968, p. 28): &ldquo;Every cognition is
 produced with a twofold appearance, namely, that of itself [as
 subject]&nbsp; (<em>sv&#257;bh&#257;sa</em>)&nbsp;and that of the
 object (<em>vi&#7779;ay&#257;bh&#257;sa</em>).&rdquo; For a philosophical
 analysis of the issues centered on &ldquo;reflexive awareness&rdquo;
 / &ldquo;self-awareness&rdquo; (<em>svasa&#7747;vedana)</em>&nbsp;see
 Arnold (2010) and MacKenzie (2107). On
<em>svasa&#7747;vedana</em>&nbsp;in Dign&#257;ga, see Kellner
(2010).&nbsp;The first theme became part of the rationale for the
Dign&#257;ga-Dharmak&#299;rti idealism that holds the mind is
<em>only</em> aware of mental data, and that that is all there
actually is. The Epistemological School's main argument for idealism
is the so-called <em>sahopalambhaniyama</em> (&ldquo;certainty of
[subject and object] being perceived together&rdquo;): &ldquo;blue and
the awareness of blue are not different, because they must always be
apprehended together, just like when one [falsely] sees two
moons.&rdquo; A variant is the so-called
&ldquo;<em>sa&#7747;vedana</em>- inference&rdquo;: &ldquo;the object
is not different from the cognizing consciousness, because it is being
cognized (<em>sa&#7747;vedyam&#257;na</em>); only what is essentially
identical (<em>t&#257;d&#257;tmya</em>) with consciousness is
cognizable.&rdquo; (External objects, if they existed, would be
unknowable.) See Iwata (1984; 1991) and Matilal (1974, p.
159&ndash;160). See Kellner (2017) for Vasubandhu's and

Note, too, that Dign&#257;ga and all other major subsequent Buddhist

 Dharmak&#299;rti when faced with the problem of
&ldquo;aboutness&rdquo; says the following in
<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;rttika</em> III.53 (ed. H. Tosaki 1979,
1985):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If it said that [quasi-universals, that is, <em>apoha</em>] will lose
their status of being properties of [real] entities
(<em>bh&#257;vadharmatva</em>), this is not a fault, for the cognition
of the [quasi-universal] was preceded by an apprehension of the
entity.
<br />
(<em>bh&#257;vadharmatvah&#257;ni&#347; ced

<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;rttikapa&ntilde;jik&#257;</em> (Peking
edition) 167b8&ndash;168a1:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When conceptual thought (<em>rnam par rtog pa</em> = <em>vikalpa</em>)
arises in dependence upon tendencies (<em>bag chags</em> =
<em>v&#257;san&#257;</em>) that were instilled due to one's having
seen [particular] forms and so forth, it determines (<em>zhen pa</em>
= <em>adhyavas&#257;ya</em>) apprehended images (<em>rnam pa</em> =
<em>&#257;k&#257;ra</em>) of its own as being the images of form and
so forth and thus practically applies [to forms, etc.] In this way,
[thought of form, etc., i.e., thought of the universal] arises
[indirectly] due to the influence of seeing [particular] forms and so
forth, and determines [its own images] to be those [i.e., real
features of form], and therefore [for the combination of these two
reasons] one does call [the apoha quasi-universal] a property of the
[real] entity.

 For Dharmak&#299;rti (and Dign&#257;ga), there is another important
condition necessary for aboutness: error. At the key stage in the
causal chain, namely, when the mind makes a judgment that such and
such thing is an instance of <em>blue</em>, error
(<em>bhr&#257;nti</em>) comes in and indeed is indispensable: the mind
must supposedly be seduced into thinking that its mental content,
i.e., the representation of non-non-blue, is not just merely
mind-created, but pertains to the world. In order for us to apply
language and concepts to things in the world, we need to somehow
ignore the differences that there are between all particulars and
think and talk in terms of common properties to whose reality we are
unreflectively and naively committed, even if in our more
sophisticated theoretical reflections we might be persuaded that they
are merely our own inventions. On the Buddhists' theory of unconscious
error, see Tillemans (1999, ch. 10; 2011).</p>

 It is the notorious
<em>as&#257;dh&#257;ra&#7751;&#257;naik&#257;ntikahetu</em>
(&ldquo;reason which is uncertain because of being [too]
exclusive&rdquo;) that especially provokes this reorientation towards
the epistemic. This fallacious reason occurs when the subject
<em>A</em> is coextensive with the reason <em>C</em>, and involves a
failure of the second and third criteria of a good reason. Taking the
epistemic interpretation of the problem, it is said that most people
will find it impossible to <em>know</em> that all <em>C</em>s are
<em>B</em>, because there is no example <em>D</em> of a <em>C</em> and
<em>B</em> which is not an <em>A</em>. It is accepted, on this
interpretation,&nbsp;that the similar instances
(<em>sapak&#7779;a</em>)&nbsp;can include all <em>A</em>s<em>.</em>
The factual interpretation is to say when the subject <em>A</em> and
reason <em>C</em> are coextensive (e.g., sounds and what is audible)
then the problem is that the <em>C</em>s <em>are not</em> present in
the similar instances because such instances must actually be
different from <em>A</em>. See Kajiyama (1958), Tillemans (1999, ch.
5).</p>

 The point is initially developed in Tillemans (1986) and primarily
with regard to Tibetan treatments. It should be stressed, however,
that these problems of opaque contexts are not Geluk Tibetan
inventions, but are certainly those of Dharmak&#299;rti.</p>

 For a few of the numerous publications on these subjects in
Dharmak&#299;rti, see Steinkellner (1982), Jackson (1993), Franco
(1997), Taber (2003; 2009), Eltschinger (2007b; 2014), McClintock
(2010), Pecchia (2015). Vetter (1990) contains a German translation of
the section in the second chapter of
<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;rttika</em> concerning the four noble
truths.</p>

 See e.g., <em>Pram&#257;&#7751;av&#257;rttika</em> IV. 106: &ldquo;In
the case of inaccessible things, if a scripture is not accepted [as
being a <em>pram&#257;&#7751;a</em>] then no analysis [of a given
subject matter described in the scripture] will occur at all&rdquo;
(<em>parok&#7779;e&#7779;v &#257;gam&#257;ni&#7779;&#7789;au na
cintaiva pravartate.)</em> See Tillemans (2000, p. 148&ndash;149).</p>

 For an autobiographical account of how a modern Buddhist is attracted
to Dharmak&#299;rti's philosophy and then&nbsp;troubled by the
dogmatic way in which it is used, see chapter 4 in Stephen Batchelor,
<em>Confession of a Buddhist Atheist.</em> New York: Spiegel and Grau,
2010.</p>

<h3 id="AnciPhilNatuVersAgre">A.1 Ancient Philosophers on Nature Versus Agreement</h3>

<p>
Ancient Greek inquiries into the nature of social phenomena introduced
questions that remain active today: Which features of the world are
products of humans or society, and which are products of nature? What
does it mean to say that something is a social creation?</p>

<p>
A central concern of Sophism, a school of Greek thought in the fifth
century BCE, is the contrast between nature (<em>phusis</em>) and
custom, law, habit, or convention (<em>nomos</em>). They debate, for
instance, the sources of justice: Does justice arise from nature and
innate human inclinations? Or, instead, is justice a product of the
customs of the cities we inhabit?</p>

<p>
Sophist responses to these questions depend on their views of how
nature and law/custom are related to one another. Protagoras, for
instance, sees law/custom as part of the natural order, developed for
the preservation of society and the perpetuation of the species
(Plato, <em>Protagoras</em> 320c&ndash;328a). Antiphon, on the other hand, argues for a fundamental difference between law/custom and
nature. The decrees of <em>nomoi</em>, he writes, are </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the products of agreement, not of natural growth, whereas those of
<em>phusis</em> are the products of natural growth, not of agreement.
(Antiphon DK 87A44a)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In his view, law and nature may conflict with one another. When they
do, human law causes suffering since it interferes with the natural
order. Still other Sophists hold that laws/customs come in different
types. Those produced by human agreement are flawed, because they
conflict with nature. Good laws/customs, in these views, are a product
of the divine order (Heraclitus DK 22B114), or of the agreement of
the gods (Plato, <em>Euthyphro</em> 9e). Similar debates also form the
heart of ancient discussions of the nature of language (e.g.,
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Cratylus</em>), and money (e.g., Aristotle,
<em>Politics</em> 1.8&ndash;10; Paulus, <em>Pandects</em> 18.1).</p>

<p>
These ancient inquiries explore the mix between natural and human
contributions in the construction of familiar features of the world.
They do not, however, theorize much about exactly <em>what</em> people
do in order to create the social world. Instead, they speak of
agreements, compacts, conventions, habits, laws, customs, and so on,
without paying particular notice to separating these from one another.
This tendency continues with later authors and their analysis of other
social phenomena that are assumed to be included within the law.
Augustine, for instance, writing in the fifth century CE, discusses
the problem of the private ownership of property. He argues that
property ownership is not justified on the basis of God&rsquo;s law,
but rather is a product of the laws agreed to in that society. In his
view, ownership&mdash;like the rest of human law&mdash;is a product of
human agreement (<em>Tractate on the Gospel of John,</em> 6.25).</p>

<h3 id="EarlModeDebaSourSociEnti">A.2 Early Modern Debates on the Sources of Social Entities</h3>

<p>
The central concern in early modern debates over the social echoed
that of the ancients: what are the sources of social entities and
phenomena? But theories of these sources broadened considerably, as
did the variety of social phenomena being investigated. Early modern
theorists also laid the foundations for a new inquiry that blossomed
in later centuries&mdash;not into the sources of social phenomena, but
into their constituents or building blocks.</p>

<h4 id="HobbCommProdCove">A.2.1 Hobbes: the commonwealth as a product of covenants</h4>

<p>
Hobbes, in <em>Leviathan</em> (1651),
addresses the nature of the state
or commonwealth, among other topics. He argues that a stable
commonwealth is generated by covenants among all the people in a
society. A covenant, according to Hobbes, is a contract that involves
performance into the future, while a contract is a voluntary agreement
between two people to transfer rights to one another. A commonwealth
is generated by every person forming the covenant with every other to
transfer their future rights of self-governance to a sovereign.</p>

<p>
Hobbes thus analyzes the stable commonwealth in terms of a particular
form of agreement. Hobbes&rsquo;s analysis is reflexive: the people
who institute the commonwealth are those who are members of the
commonwealth. Hobbes also provides an analysis of agreement, a crucial
part of which is to explain what makes agreements binding. An
agreement is valid, he argues, only if there is an external power to
enforce it. That is, someone external to the parties has enough power
over them to force compliance with the agreement&rsquo;s terms.</p>

<p>
Central to Hobbes&rsquo; account is the development of a commonwealth
from a &ldquo;state of nature&rdquo;, the anarchic time prior to the
formation of the social covenants. The notion of a state of nature, as
well as challenges to it, influence the subsequent development of
social ontology. One controversy is over the role a history of the
development of a social entity plays in accounts of its nature. Hume
1748 denies the plausibility of Hobbes&rsquo; history of the formation
of the commonwealth. And even if the historical account were true, an
account of the <em>development</em> of the commonwealth seems to be
distinct from an account of the <em>nature</em> or the sources of the
norms of a commonwealth. Another controversy is over the picture of
individual people as being &ldquo;non-social&rdquo; or
&ldquo;pre-social&rdquo; parties to a covenant. More contemporary
theorists have questioned both the historical truth and even the
conceptual possibility of &ldquo;pre-social&rdquo; people as the
building blocks of society (Macpherson 1962, Okin 1989; see also
sections
 <a href="#CultHoli">A.3.2</a>,
 <a href="index-2.html#NonSociBuilBloc">3.1</a>,
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#SociConsBuilBloc">3.2</a>).</p>
 
<h4 id="PufeHumeProdConv">A.2.2 Pufendorf and Hume: products of convention</h4>

<p>
As an alternative to &lsquo;compact&rsquo; or &lsquo;agreement,&rsquo;
the legal theorist Samuel Pufendorf, in <em>De Officio Hominis et
Civis</em> of 1673, uses the
term &lsquo;convention&rsquo; as the basis for law and language. He
argues that conventions do not need be explicitly formed or agreed to.
Instead, we can have <em>tacit</em> conventions&mdash;i.e.,
conventions that we may not even be aware we have.</p>

<p>
Pufendorf also differs from his predecessors when it comes to what
conventions accomplish. He does not merely speak of a convention as an
agreement to cooperate or act in some way. Instead, by putting
conventions in place, we create new features of the social world. For
instance, Pufendorf holds that one kind of property ownership has its
source in tacit convention. We have the tacit convention that the
first person to occupy a piece of virgin soil becomes its owner.
Without the convention, the first person to occupy a piece of virgin
soil is no more than an occupant. The convention, however, generates
new social institution: a form of ownership according to which being
first occupant suffices to make a person an owner (<em>De
Officio,</em> XII, 2).</p>

<p>
Hume greatly advances the analysis of convention and of social
phenomena in terms of it (Hume 1740, Book III). He expands the scope
of convention to include a wide variety of social entities&mdash;not
only law, property, and language, but also money, government, justice,
and promises. Hume is also the first to provide a sophisticated
analysis of convention. In his view, convention consists of each
member of a community having a sense of common interest with others,
recognizing that other people have that sense as well, and all of them
acting in common ways to benefit public utility. Hume thus analyzes
convention in terms of the attitudes and actions of individuals, and
his analysis accommodates tacit as well as explicit conventions.</p>

<h4 id="FilmLockProdGodNatu">A.2.3 Filmer and Locke: products of God and Nature</h4>

<p>
Other early modern philosophers root the social world in the
natural&mdash;both in divine commandment and in human nature. Robert
Filmer, a seventeenth century monarchist, argues in
<em>Patriarcha</em> (1680) that
the state is a family. This implies, according to Filmer, that state
authority is no different from the authority of a father over his
family. Patriarchal authority is divinely sanctioned, as recorded in
the commandments of the Bible. The authority of kings over their
subjects is identical, he argues: it is inherited from the paternity
of Adam, who begat a large family and then passed authority to a
succession of leaders. Thus the absolute authority of monarchs, for
Filmer, is rooted in the divinely established natural order. This
analysis extends to the nature of laws and property. The monarch may
choose to institute laws for practical purposes, just as a father may
institute rules for a household. And the monarch may grant property
rights to subjects. But those laws and rights consist in nothing more
than the will of the monarch and may be overridden whenever the
monarch chooses.</p>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s <em>Two Treatises on Government</em> (1689)
sharply criticize Filmer and
provide a competing analysis, though Locke, too, sees God and nature
as the sources of the state and of property. Locke rejects
Filmer&rsquo;s comparison of the state with a family, arguing instead
that political authority has its source in the natural rights of each
individual created equally. Moreover, private property cannot be
derived from the state, according to Locke, since we establish civil
society for the very purpose of protecting property rights. The source
of property, for Locke, is the natural rights of each individual.
Among the rights arising from God&rsquo;s creation are self-ownership
and, hence, ownership of one&rsquo;s own labor. When a person performs
labor on a part of the world, the labor mixes with that part and joins
to become one with it. Since people own their own labor, the part of
the world mixed with labor thus becomes the person&rsquo;s
property.</p>

<h4 id="LockProdIndiMind">A.2.4 Locke: products of the individual mind</h4>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s theory of &ldquo;nominal essence&rdquo; is important for
a number of contemporary approaches to social ontology, even though
Locke does not himself associate nominal essences with the social
world in particular. A nominal essence is a definition of a species or
sort of thing, which people assemble in their minds out of ideas.
Individuals generate these definitions when they observe things in the
world and classify them according to their apparent similarities. For
instance, a person might observe different marital statuses among men,
and use those observed qualities to define the sort or species
<em>bachelor.</em> The essential conditions for something to be a
bachelor, for that person, are just what the person has defined them
to be: that person&rsquo;s species <em>bachelor</em> is &ldquo;the
workmanship of the understanding&rdquo; (see the entry on
 <a href="../real-essence/index.html">Locke on real essences</a>).
 In Locke&rsquo;s view, all sorts or species have nominal essences: he
does not single out those things that are products of people or
society. Several contemporary philosophers, however, distinguish
natural kinds (e.g., <em>water, gold</em>) from non-natural kinds
(e.g., <em>bachelor, nation</em>), and employ a Locke-style approach
with regard to the non-natural kinds. (See Schwartz 1980, Abbott 1989,
Marconi 2013. Debates on this were sparked by Kripke 1972 and Putnam
1975. Putnam 1975 and Kornblith 1980 oppose the nominal kinds
approach.)</p>

<p>
Nominal essences, in Locke&rsquo;s approach, are generated
mentalistically: they are formed from the association of ideas in the
mind. Moreover, they are generated individualistically: a nominal
essence defined by any given person is fully defined by that
person&rsquo;s own mental states. Although two people might have the
same definition for <em>bachelor,</em> the species for each person is
the product of that person&rsquo;s own ideas. In this sense,
Locke&rsquo;s approach is not social: it takes a nominal essence to be
the product of an individual&rsquo;s own mental states.</p>

<h4 id="ImplDistBetwConsSour">A.2.5 The implicit distinction between constituents and sources</h4>

<p>
In these theories, we see Locke pursuing two distinct inquiries, both
of which are pertinent to the nature of social entities. One is an
inquiry into the constituents of social entities, and the other is an
inquiry into the sources of social categories. Consider, for instance,
the two parts of Locke&rsquo;s discussion of nominal essence. First,
to be a member of a species (such as the species <em>bachelor</em>)
consists of a person having certain properties (i.e., being unmarried
and being a man). Second, the <em>sources</em> of that species are the
associations of ideas in the conceiver&rsquo;s mind. Both of these are
aspects of the &ldquo;ontology&rdquo; or &ldquo;metaphysics&rdquo; of
<em>bachelor.</em> Being unmarried is part of what it <em>is</em> to
be a bachelor&mdash;not just a cause of being a bachelor&mdash;despite
the fact that marriage is a process that takes place over time. (See
 <a href="index-2.html#OntoVersCaus">section 2.2</a>
 for discussion of causal versus ontological relations). Similarly,
the association of ideas is a metaphysical reason, not just a causal
one, for the species <em>bachelor</em> to have the essence it
does.</p>

<p>
A similar distinction between constituents and sources is implicit in
Locke&rsquo;s account of property: ownership <em>consists in</em>
having one&rsquo;s labor historically mixed with parts of the world;
and <em>the source of</em> that method for establishing property is
the nature of people as they are created (<em>Second Treatise,</em>
27). (See sections
 <a href="index-2.html#WhatMeanBuilSociWorl">2.3</a>,
 <a href="index-2.html#ConsSociWorl">3</a>, and
 <a href="index-2.html#HowSociCateKindSetUp">4</a>
 for contemporary theories of constituents vs. sources of social
entities.)</p>

<h3 id="IndiAggrWhol">A.3 Individuals, Aggregates, and Wholes</h3>

<p>
Advances in science and interest in political governance led
Enlightenment theorists to draw analogies between the traditional
domains of science&mdash;such as heavenly bodies, chemicals, and
organisms&mdash;and the newly salient domains of economies and
societies. The push to develop a science of society motivates a
different emphasis in social ontology, as compared to earlier
theories. Whereas ancient and early modern theorists largely
investigated the sources or generators of social entities, these
theorists devoted more attention to analyzing social entities into
their constituent parts.</p>

<h4 id="AggrSociOrde">A.3.1 Aggregates and social order</h4>

<p>
In <em>The Spirit of the Laws</em> (1748),
Montesquieu theorizes about
cultural differences between nations or societies as a whole. He
argues that nations have characters, over which generalizations can be
drawn. At the same time, however, nations are implicitly understood to
be aggregates of individual people. The effects of climate on the
characters of European nations, for instance, is analyzed in terms of
the effects of climate on individual people who are the parts of those
nations.</p>

<p>
The picture of societies as aggregates of individuals is taken up by
philosophers in the Scottish Enlightenment. To it, they add the idea
of spontaneous order: social order, they argue, arises from aggregates
of individuals interacting with one another, even if the individuals
did not plan the order. &ldquo;Nations stumble on
establishments&rdquo;, Adam Ferguson (1767) writes, &ldquo;which are
indeed the result of human action, but not the execution of any human
design&rdquo;. Adam Smith (1776) explores this in connection with
economic growth, arguing that economic benefits in the aggregate arise
from the interactions of self-interested individuals.</p>

<p>
Later attempts to develop a rigorous science of the social world also
employ a similar picture of the components of society. J.S. Mill
builds on Comte 1830&ndash;1842 to argue that social science is a
branch of psychology. Society, according to Mill, is the aggregate of
human minds, and the topic of the social sciences is to derive laws
governing such aggregates (Mill 1843 VI, VII, 1). Altogether, his
approach to social phenomena is &ldquo;psychologistic&rdquo;: he takes
social phenomena to be built exclusively out of psychological states
of individual people. (The interpretation and expansion of
psychologism becomes an important topic in twentieth century
individualism; see sections
 <a href="index-2.html#NonSociBuilBloc">3.1</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#SociConsBuilBloc">3.2</a>.)</p>
 

<p>
Spencer (1895) also argues that society is an aggregate of
individuals, and that social science is the study of laws of such
aggregates. Spencer combines this with the claim that societies are
organisms, much like biological ones. The &ldquo;laws&rdquo; of
evolution apply to societies, in his view, and can be derived from the
characteristics of individuals.</p>

<h4 id="CultHoli">A.3.2 Culture and holism</h4>

The historicist tradition in eighteenth and nineteenth century German
philosophy inverts the relation between individuals and societies.
Rather than seeing individuals as primary, these philosophers stress
the primacy of societies, with individuals a product of the societies
in which they are brought up. (This view too has ancient origins; see
Aristotle, <em>Politics</em> 1253a.)</p>

<p>
Herder argues that human perception, thought, and action depend on
language. And language, in his view, is fundamentally social: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Go into the age, into the clime, the whole history, feel yourself into
everything&mdash;only now are you on the way towards understanding the
word. (Herder 1774; also see Herder 1769 &amp; 1772) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like his predecessors, Herder argues that cultures possess characters,
affecting how the cultures act overall, but in Herder&rsquo;s view,
historical explanation requires treating societies as unified
entities, and regarding individuals as products of society.</p>

<p>
Herder&rsquo;s assertion that individuals are products of society is a
causal claim about how individuals come to be the way they are, rather
than an ontological claim about society being metaphysically
fundamental to or constitutive of the individual (Forster 2010).
Despite insisting that individual perception, thought, and action
depend on language, Herder does not view these as being &ldquo;built
out of&rdquo; social constituents. Instead, he takes language to be
internal to individual minds, and argues that language (and
correspondingly perception, thought and action) are causally affected
by society. Individuals are profoundly affected by the cultures in
which they are raised, to the extent that it makes little sense to
admit the possibility of a normally functioning Hobbesian pre-social
individual. Still, that is not the same as the ontological claim that
individuals are literally constituted in part by society.</p>

<p>
Hegel, in contrast, does make that explicitly ontological claim. To be
a self, according to Hegel, involves self-consciousness. And this is
not something that an individual can possess independently of others.
Instead, self-consciousness depends on our having a sense of ourselves
as individuals as distinct from others, which in turn depends on our
interacting with other people (i.e., recognizing other people and
being recognized by them) (Hegel 1807 Secs. 176, 184).</p>

<p>
Hegel also develops the idea, following H&ouml;lderlin, of a
&ldquo;World-Soul&rdquo; or universal human spirit, of which
individual actions are a manifestation. Hegel deduces the existence of
this universal spirit from the idealist argument that objects are
created by consciousness, together with the observation that the
objects of our experience are shared among all people (Solomon 1985).
Hegel&rsquo;s universal spirit is sometimes used as an example of
&ldquo;ontological holism&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., the claim that social
entities are fundamental, independent, or autonomous entities, as
opposed to being derived from individuals or non-social entities
(Taylor 1975, Rosen 1984). The accuracy of this reading of Hegel is
debated among Hegel scholars (see Hartmann 1972, Pippin 1989, Brandom
2001, Beiser 2005, Horstmann 2006, Kreines 2015). Fairly or not, Hegel
was widely interpreted in this way in his own time and subsequently.
Feuerbach 1843, for instance, accuses Hegel of postulating the
existence of ghostly things, and a metaphysical reading of Hegel
exerted a strong influence on T.H. Green and other British
idealists.</p>

<h4 id="CrowSociFact">A.3.3 Crowds and social facts</h4>

<p>
Popular revolts&mdash;and anxieties about mass movements&mdash;in the
nineteenth century sparked interest in the nature of crowds. Crowd
theorists, including Taine 1887, Ferri 1884, Sighele 1891, and Le Bon
1895 argued that people are radically transformed when they gather
into a crowd. They ascribe mental properties, such as impetuousness
and irrationality, to crowds as a whole. Tarde 1890 postulated
mechanisms by which crowds acquire these characteristics, by way of
the psychology of individuals and interactions among people. The most
famous of these was his &ldquo;law of imitation&rdquo;, according to
which behaviors propagate among groups by starting with a person of
influence, who is then imitated by others whether or not they are
conscious of doing so.</p>

<p>
Durkheim 1894 challenged these explanations, arguing that such
individualistic laws cannot be adequate to explain crowd psychology or
other social phenomena. Crowds do not become menacing, according to
Durkheim, because individuals transform from well-mannered citizens
into irrational beasts. Instead, the power of the crowd exerts a
coercive influence on individuals. More generally, Durkheim argues
that &ldquo;social facts&rdquo; are autonomous of individuals and have
the power to constrain and affect their actions.</p>

<p>
In social ontology, Tarde is often seen as a representative of
&ldquo;individualism&rdquo; and Durkheim of &ldquo;holism&rdquo;
regarding the social world, and their positions remain a touchstone
for contemporary debates (see section
 <a href="index-2.html#ConsSociWorl">3</a>).
 But it is controversial how to characterize Durkheim&rsquo;s view in
particular. See Lukes 1985, Greenwood 2003, Borch 2012, Zahle &amp;
Collin 2014a.</p>

<h3 id="ConsSociCate">A.4 The Construction of Social Categories</h3>

<p>
The views discussed in
 <a href="#IndiAggrWhol">section A.3</a>
 largely address the parts or constituents of social entities.
Nineteenth century social criticism also reopened the question of the
sources of social categories, suggesting radically new approaches.
Critics began to scrutinize commonplace categories&mdash;often ones
that we employ in our daily practices&mdash;revealing that they have
darker (or at least richer) underpinnings than we realize. Their
approaches raise questions about the motivations for using these
categories, as well as their nature and metaphysical sources.</p>

<h4 id="MarxReif">A.4.1 Marxism and reification</h4>

<p>
In a section of <em>Capital</em> titled &ldquo;The Fetishism of
Commodities and the Secret Thereof&rdquo;, Karl Marx argues that
certain social categories that might appear natural are in fact the
products of social and economic relations among people. A commodity,
such as gold or coal or corn, has some natural properties, as well as
some properties that are obviously attached to them by people. A
commodity&rsquo;s value is, according to Marx, a product of the labor
it takes to produce it. The social character of individual labor,
though, is hidden (Marx 1867). It might seem that a bushel of corn, as
a component of our economic system, is a product of a farmer working
the land. But Marx argues that commodities can only be understood in
terms of social structures as a whole.</p>

<p>
Marx also argues that the sources of these structures are neither
intellectual nor psychological. Instead, the ideological features of a
society are determined by the material relations among people in that
society, including technologies, systems of production, and relations
of power.</p>

<p>
Marx himself is largely interested in describing these structures and
the interactions among them. The discussion of commodities is a rare
instance of an ontological claim by Marx. Subsequent philosophers,
however, put claims of the constructedness of social entities at the
center of social critique. Luk&aacute;cs 1923 argues that capitalism
extensively &ldquo;reifies&rdquo; social entities&mdash;that is, it
turns phenomena that arise from an oppressive economic system into
features of the world that we regard as natural. Members of the
Frankfurt School, especially Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, build
on Luk&aacute;cs to argue not just that the social world becomes
&ldquo;second nature&rdquo; to us, but that the reification itself is
part of the maintenance of the reified system. That is, our current
social order is maintained, at least in part, by the causal effects of
our treating social entities and categories as if they were natural
(Adorno &amp; Horkheimer 1947, Adorno 1966).</p>

<p>
Uncovering social categories becomes a centerpiece of subsequent
social criticism. If oppressive structures are to be dismantled, the
social nature of the everyday world first needs to be revealed. The
work of the Frankfurt School in particular influenced contemporary
feminist and race theory (see
 <a href="index-2.html#RaceGendDisa">section 5.4</a>).</p>
 
<h4 id="HistConsGeneSociCate">A.4.2 Historical construction and genealogies of social categories</h4>

<p>
Nietzsche employs a historical or &ldquo;genealogical&rdquo; method in
<em>On the Genealogy of Morals</em> (1887) to critique the basic
categories of Christian morality. Challenging the idea that this
morality is basic to human nature, he argues that prevailing moral
categories were tools intentionally wielded in a struggle for power.
Ideals of humility and self-denial, for instance, were introduced by
leaders of a resentful population to undermine the aristocratic values
of Greco-Roman society. In Nietzsche&rsquo;s account, the sources of
such categories are largely cognitive and intentional, as opposed to
arising from material relations, as they do in Marx&rsquo;s
account.</p>

<p>
Social critics widely deploy genealogical methods to call into
question social categories that are commonly taken to be natural or
innocuous. Freud, for instance, argues that human interest in justice
originates in childhood envy, and that monotheism originates in a
purported conflict between Moses and the Israelites (Freud 1921,
1939). Michel Foucault writes genealogies of contemporary categories
of punishment, sexuality, and the development of the self, among
others. Foucault 1977a describes the contingency and the political influences that lie behind
how we think about criminality and imprisonment.</p>

<p>
A fundamental worry about genealogy is whether it actually says
anything about the nature of social categories: Can genealogy reveal
the true or hidden character of morality, justice, religion,
punishment, or sexuality? Or does it merely give us a story of
origins? After all, <em>every</em> category, natural and unnatural
alike, has a history of how it developed. Why should it should matter
if the history is deplorable? (For challenges and defenses, see
Foucault 1977b, Geuss 1981, Salmon 1984, Schacht 1994, Gutting 2005,
Epstein 2010, Koopman 2013).</p>

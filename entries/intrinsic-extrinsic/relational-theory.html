<h2>The Relational Account of Intrinsicality</h2>

<p>
Robert Franscecotti (1999, 2014) has outlined an analysis that takes
the concept of intrinsicality as non-relationality to be primary.
Francescotti takes a property to be extrinsic if an object possesses
it in virtue of its relations to other objects. So <em>being a
duplicate of Jack</em> and <em>being such that the number 17
exists</em> are extrinsic, while <em>being identical to Jack</em> and
<em>being a vertebrate</em> (i.e. <em>having a vertebral column</em>)
are intrinsic. Francescotti notes that not all relational properties
are extrinsic. <em>Having a vertebral column</em>, for instance, seems
to be relational in that it consists of a relation to a vertebral
column, but it is also an intrinsic property. So he focuses on
relations to wholly distinct objects. </p>

<p>
Francescotti does not give an entirely precise statement of his
account. On one way of spelling it out, however, the account is as
follows. First, a property \(F\) is defined to be a d-relational
property of \(x\) iff: \(x\) has \(F\), and either</p>

<ol type="a">

<li>There is a relation \(R\), and an item \(y\), such that
(i) the state of affairs of \(x\) having \(F\) is the state
of affairs of \(x\) bearing \(R\) to \(y\), and (ii)
\(y\) is not part of \(x\); or</li>

<li>There is a relation \(R\), and a set of items \(C\),
such that (i) the state of affairs of \(x\) having \(F\) is
the state of affairs of there being some member of \(C\) to which
\(x\) bears \(R\), and (ii) at least one member of
\(C\) to which \(x\) bears \(R\) is not part of
\(x\); or</li>

<li>There is a relation \(R\), and a set of items \(C\),
such that (i) the state of affairs of \(x\) having \(F\) is
the state of affairs of \(x\) bearing \(R\) to every member
of \(C\), and (ii) it is possible that there is a member of
\(C\) that is not part of \(x\); or</li>

<li>The state of affairs of \(x\) having \(F\) can be
expressed by a truth-functional compound, at least one of whose
constituents expresses a state of affairs satisfying (a), (b) or
(c).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Secondly, an internal property of \(x\) is defined to be a
property had by \(x\) that is not a d-relational property of
\(x\). Thirdly, \(F\) is defined to be an intrinsic property
of \(x\) iff there are internal properties
\(I_1 ,\ldots ,I_n\) such that the
state of affairs of \(x\) having \(F\) is identical to the state
of affairs of \(x\) having
\(I_1 ,\ldots ,I_n\). Finally,
\(F\) is claimed to be an intrinsic property iff, necessarily, for
any \(x\), if \(x\) has \(F\), then \(F\) is an intrinsic
property of \(x\).</p>

<p>
There are a number of problems with this formulation of
Francescotti&rsquo;s account. One problem is that it appears not to
classify the property of being accompanied as d-relational, and hence
appears not to classify it as extrinsic. (Recall that something is
accompanied iff it coexists with something wholly distinct from itself
that contingently exists.) This property would be classified as a
d-relational property of Obama, for example, if there were some set
\(C\) and a relation \(R\) such that the state of affairs of
Obama being accompanied is identical to the state of affairs of there
being a member \(y\) of \(C\) to which \(x\) bears the
relation \(R\) (where at least one member of \(C\) to which
\(x\) bears \(R\) to is not part of \(x)\). However, there
appears to be no such set. (For example, suppose \(C\) is the set
of all contingently existing things wholly distinct from Obama. Then
the state of affairs of Obama being accompanied would need to be
identical to the state of affairs of there being a contingently
existing member of \(C\) that Obama coexists with and is wholly
distinct from. However, since Obama could have been accompanied
without any of the contingently existing things Obama is actually
accompanied by existing, the former state of affairs could have been
true without the latter being true, and hence these states of affairs
aren&rsquo;t identical.)</p>

<p>
This problem can be rectified by replacing sets with properties in
Francescotti&rsquo;s account, replacing (b) and (c) with (b*) and
(c*):</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em jfy">
<li><span class="tag">(b*)</span>
<span class="sen">
There is a relation \(R\), and a property \(P\), such
that (i) the state of affairs of \(x\) having \(F\) is the
state of affairs of there being something that has \(P\) to which
\(x\) bears \(R\), and (ii) at least one thing having
\(P\) to which \(x\) bears \(R\) is not part of
\(x\).</span></li>
</ul>

<ul class="sentag tag3em jfy">
<li><span class="tag">(c*)</span>
<span class="sen">
There is a relation \(R\), and a property \(P\), such
that (i) the state of affairs of \(x\) having \(F\) is the
state of affairs of \(x\) bearing \(R\) to every thing
having \(P\), and (ii) it is possible that there is something
having \(P\) that is not part of \(x\).
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
A deeper problem with Francescotti&rsquo;s account is that it is
incompatible with a number of accounts of properties. (In the
following we will use &lsquo;property&rsquo; broadly to include states
of affairs, which may be thought of as zero-place properties, and
relations, which may be thought of as multiple place properties, as
well as one-place properties.) Consider, for example, the coarse-grain
theory of properties according to which all necessarily coextensive
properties are identical. (Two states of affairs are necessarily
coextensive iff they are necessarily equivalent.) Given this theory of
properties, any intrinsic property \(F\) of a thing \(x\)
will be a d-relational property of \(x\), since the state of
affairs of \(x\) having \(F\) will be identical to the
property of either being \(F\) and lonely, or else being
\(F\) and accompanied, and hence will be expressible by a
truth-functional compound at least one of whose constituents express a
state of affairs satisfying (b*). Hence, given the coarse-grain theory
of properties, Francescotti&rsquo;s account falsely classifies every
intrinsic property is being extrinsic.</p>

<p>
Francescotti&rsquo;s account is also incompatible with standard fine
grain theories of properties. Consider, for example, a Russellian
theory of properties, according to which properties are structured
entities built up out of objects, coarse-grain properties, and
coarse-grain operators, combined with the view that the structure of
properties matches the syntactic structure of the predicates
expressing those properties. Given this fine grain account,
&lsquo;Obama is accompanied&rsquo; and &lsquo;There is a contingently
existing \(x\) such that Obama is wholly distinct from, and
coexisting with, \(x\)&rsquo; express different states of
affairs, since these sentences have different syntactic structures. As
a result, given this fine grain theory, the property of being
accompanied is not d-relational, since it cannot be expressed by a
predicate of the form \(\ulcorner\lambda x\exists y Rxy\urcorner\)
(and cannot be expressed by a predicate of any other form that would
make it count as d-relational). Hence, the property of being
accompanied is falsely classified as intrinsic by Francescotti&rsquo;s
account on this fine grain theory of properties.</p>

<p>
The fact that Francescott&rsquo;s account is incompatible with these
theories of properties might not be a decisive objection against the
account since these theories might be rejected. In particular, there
might be strong reasons to reject these theories based on
considerations stemming from intrinsicality itself. For example, given
numbers necessarily exist, the coarse-grain theory is incompatible
with the intuition that certain necessarily coextensive properties,
such as <em>being self-identical</em> and <em>being such that there is
a number</em>, differ in their intrinsicality, since, according to the
coarse-grain theory, such properties are identical. This intuition
about intrinsicality might therefore be used to reject the
coarse-grain theory. If an account of intrinsicality respects this
intuition, and as result is incompatible with the coarse-grain theory
of properties, this might therefore not be a mark against the account.
In addition to not being compatible with the above theories of
properties, however, it is not obvious that Francescotti&rsquo;s
account is compatible with any credible theory of properties. In order
to properly evaluate Francescotti&rsquo;s account, therefore,
proponents of the account need to specify what theories of properties
it is compatible with, and why we should believe that at least one of
these theories is true. This task has not yet been carried out.</p>

<h3><a name="EarDev">The Early Development</a></h3>

<p>

The historical development of QFT is very instructive until the
present day. Its first achievement, namely the quantization of the
electromagnetic field is &ldquo;still the paradigmatic example of a
successful quantum field theory&rdquo; (Weinberg 1995). Ordinary QM
cannot give an account of photons which constitute the prime case of relativistic &lsquo;particles&rsquo;. Since photons have the
rest mass zero, and correspondingly travel in the vacuum at the
velocity, naturally, of light \(c\) it is ruled out that a
non-relativistic theory such as ordinary QM could give even an
approximate description. Photons are implicitly contained in the
emission and absorption processes which have to be postulated, for
instance, when one of an atom&rsquo;s electrons makes a transition from a
higher to a lower energy level or vice versa. However, only the
formalism of QFT contains an explicit description of photons. In fact most 
topics in the early development of quantum theory (1900&ndash;1927) were related to the interaction of
radiation and matter and should be treated by quantum field
theoretical methods. However, the approach to quantum mechanics formulated
by Dirac, Heisenberg and Schr&ouml;dinger (1926/27) started from
atomic spectra and did not rely very much on problems of radiation.</p>

<p>

As soon as the conceptual framework of quantum mechanics was developed, a
small group of theoreticians immediately tried to extend the methods
to electromagnetic fields. A good example is the famous three-man
paper by M.&nbsp;Born, W.&nbsp;Heisenberg, and P.&nbsp;Jordan
(1926). Especially P.&nbsp;Jordan was acquainted with the literature
on light quanta and made important contributions to QFT. The basic
analogy was that in QFT field quantities, i.e., the electric and
magnetic field, should be represented by matrices in the same way as
in QM position and momentum are represented by matrices. The ideas of
QM were extended to systems having an infinite number of degrees of freedom.</p> 

<p>

The inception of QFT is usually dated 1927 with Dirac&rsquo;s famous paper on &ldquo;The quantum theory of the emission and absorption of
radiation&rdquo; (Dirac 1927). 
Here Dirac coined the name quantum electrodynamics
(QED) which is the part of QFT that has been developed first. Dirac
supplied a systematic procedure for transferring the characteristic
quantum phenomenon of discreteness of physical quantities from the
quantum mechanical treatment of particles to a corresponding treatment
of fields. Employing the quantum mechanical theory of the harmonic
oscillator, Dirac gave a theoretical description of how photons appear
in the quantization of the electromagnetic radiation field. Later,
Dirac&rsquo;s procedure became a model for the quantization of other fields
as well. During the following three years the first approaches to QFT
were further developed. P. Jordan introduced creation operators for
fields obeying Fermi statistics. For an elementary discussion of
quantum statistics (Fermi and Bose), see the entry on
 <a href="../qt-idind/index.html">quantum theory: identity and individuality</a>.
</p>

<p>

So the methods of QFT could be applied to equations resulting from the
quantum mechanical (field like) treatment of particles like the
electron (e.g., Dirac equation). Schweber points out (Schweber 1994,
p. 28) that the idea and procedure of that &ldquo;second
quantization&rdquo; goes back to Jordan, in a number of papers from
1927 (see references in Schweber 1994, pp. 695f), while the expression
itself was coined by Dirac. Some difficult problems concerning
commutation relations, statistics and Lorentz invariance could be
solved. The first comprehensive account of a general theory of
quantum fields, in particular the method of canonical quantization,
was presented in Heisenberg &amp; Pauli 1929. 
Whereas Jordan&rsquo;s second quantization procedure applies to the coefficients
of the normal modes of the field, Heisenberg &amp; Pauli 1929 started
with the fields themselves and subjected them to the canonical
procedure. Heisenberg and Pauli thus established the basic structure
of QFT which can be found in any introduction to QFT up to the present
day. Fermi and Dirac, Fock and Podolski presented different
formulations which played a heuristic role in the following years.</p>

<p>

Quantum electrodynamics, the historical as well as systematical
entr&eacute;e to QFT, rests on two pillars (see, e.g., the short and
lucid &ldquo;Historical Introduction&rdquo; of Scharf&rsquo;s (1995) original book). The first pillar results from the quantization of the
electromagmetic field, i.e., it is about photons as the quantized excitations or &lsquo;quanta&rsquo;
of the electromagnetic field. This procedure will be described in some more detail in the section on the particle interpretation. As Weinberg points
out the &ldquo;photon is the only particle that was known as a field
before it was detected as a particle&rdquo; so that it is natural that
QED began with the analysis of the radiation field (Weinberg 1995,
p. 15). The second pillar of QED consists in the relativistic theory
of the electron, with the Dirac equation in its centre.</p>



<h3><a name="EmeInf">The Emergence of Infinities</a></h3>

<p>

Quantum field theory started with a theoretical framework that was
built in analogy to quantum mechanics. Although there was no unique
and fully developed theory, quantum field theoretical tools could be
applied to concrete processes. Examples are the scattering of
radiation by free electrons (&ldquo;Compton scattering&rdquo;), the
collision between relativistic electrons or the production of
electron-positron pairs by photons. Calculations to the first order of
approximation were quite successful, but most people working in the
field thought that QFT still had to undergo a major change. On the one
side some calculations of effects for cosmic rays clearly differed
from measurements. On the other side and, from a theoretical point of
view more threatening, calculations of higher orders of the
perturbation series led to infinite results. The self-energy of the
electron as well as vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field
seemed to be infinite. The perturbation expansions did not converge to
a finite sum and even most individual terms were divergent.</p>

<p>

The various forms of infinities suggested that the divergences were
more than failures of specific calculations. Many physicists tried to
avoid the divergences by formal tricks (truncating the integrals at
some value of momentum, or even ignoring infinite terms) but such
rules were not reliable, violated the requirements of relativity and
were not considered as satisfactory. Others came up with first
ideas of coping with infinities by a redefinition of the parameters of
the theory and using a measured finite value (for example of the
charge of the electron) instead of the infinite &lsquo;bare&rsquo;
value (&ldquo;renormalization&rdquo;).</p>

<p>

From the point of view of philosophy of science it is remarkable that
these divergences did not give enough reason to discard the
theory. The years from 1930 to the beginning of World War II were
characterized by a variety of attitudes towards QFT. Some physicists
tried to circumvent the infinities by more-or-less arbitrary
prescriptions, others worked on transformations and improvements of
the theoretical framework. Most of the theoreticians believed that QED
would break down at high energies. There was also a considerable
number of proposals in favour of alternative approaches. These
proposals included changes in the basic concepts (e.g., negative
probabilities), interactions at a distance instead of a field
theoretical approach, and a methodological change to phenomenological
methods that focusses on relations between observable quantities
without an analysis of the microphysical details of the interaction
(the so-called S-matrix theory where the basic elements are amplitudes
for various scattering processes).</p>

<p>

Despite the feeling that QFT was imperfect and lacking rigour, its
methods were extended to new areas of applications. In 1933 Fermi&rsquo;s
theory of the beta decay started with conceptions describing the
emission and absorption of photons, transferred them to beta radiation
and analyzed the creation and annihilation of electrons and neutrinos
(weak interaction). Further applications of QFT outside of quantum
electrodynamics succeeded in nuclear physics (strong interaction). In
1934 a new type of fields (scalar fields), described by the
Klein-Gordon equation, could be quantized (another example of
&ldquo;second quantization&rdquo;). This new theory for matter fields
could be applied a decade later when new particles, pions, were
detected.</p>

<h3><a name="TamInf">The Taming of Infinities</a></h3>

<p>

After the end of World War II more reliable and effective methods for
dealing with infinities in QFT were developed, namely coherent and
systematic rules for performing relativistic field theoretical
calculations, and a general renormalization theory. On three famous
conferences between 1947 and 1949 developments in theoretical physics
were confronted with relevant new experimental results. In the late
forties there were two different ways to address the problem of
divergences. One of these was discovered by Feynman, the other one
(based on an operator formalism) by Schwinger and independently by
Tomonaga. In 1949 Dyson showed that the two approaches are in fact
equivalent. Thus, Freeman Dyson, Richard P. Feynman, Julian Schwinger
and Sin-itiro Tomonaga became the inventors of renormalization theory.
The most spectacular experimental successes of renormalization theory
were the calculations of the anomalous magnetic moment of electron and
the Lamb shift in the spectrum of hydrogen. These successes were so
outstanding because the theoretical results were in better agreement
with high precision experiments than anything in physics before. Nevertheless, mathematical problems lingered on and prompted a search for rigorous formulations (to be discussed in the main article).</p>

<p>

The basic idea of renormalization is to avoid divergences that appear
in physical predictions by shifting them into a part of the theory
where they do not influence empirical propositions. Dyson could show
that a rescaling of charge and mass (&lsquo;renormalization&rsquo;) is
sufficient to remove all divergences in QED to all orders of
perturbation theory. In general, a QFT is called renormalizable, if
all infinities can be absorbed into a redefinition of a finite number
of coupling constants and masses. A consequence is that the physical
charge and mass of the electron must be measured and cannot be
computed from first principles. Perturbation theory gives well defined
predictions only in renormalizable quantum field theories, and luckily
QED, the first fully developed QFT, belonged to this class of
renormalizable theories. There are various technical procedures to
renormalize a theory. One way is to cut off the integrals in the
calculations at a certain value \(\Lambda\) of the momentum which is
large but finite. This cut-off procedure is successful if, after
taking the limit \(\Lambda \rightarrow \infty\), the resulting
quantities are independent of \(\Lambda\) (Part II of Peskin &amp;
Schroeder 1995 gives an extensive description of renormalization).</p>

<p>

Feynman&rsquo;s formulation of QED is of special interest from a
philosophical point of view. His so-called space-time approach is
visualized by the famous Feynman diagrams that look like depicting
paths of particles. Feynman&rsquo;s method of calculating scattering
amplitudes is based on the functional integral formulation of field
theory (for an introduction to the theory and practice of Feynman
diagrams see, e.g., chapter 4 in Peskin &amp; Schroeder 1995). A set
of graphical rules can be derived so that the probability of a
specific scattering process can be calculated by drawing a diagram of
that process and then using the diagram to write down the mathematical
expressions for calculating its amplitude. The diagrams provide an
effective way to organize and visualize the various terms in the
perturbation series, and they seem to display the flow of electrons
and photons during the scattering process. External lines in the
diagrams represent incoming and outgoing particles, internal lines are
connected with &lsquo;virtual particles&rsquo; and vertices with
interactions. Each of these graphical elements is associated with
mathematical expressions that contribute to the amplitude of the
respective process. The diagrams are part of Feynman&rsquo;s very efficient
and elegant algorithm for computing the probability of scattering
processes. The idea of particles travelling from one point to another
was heuristically useful in constructing the theory, and moreover,
this intuition is useful for concrete calculations. Nevertheless, an
analysis of the theoretical justification of the space-time approach
shows that its success does not imply that particle paths have to be
taken seriously. General arguments against a particle interpretation
of QFT clearly exclude that the diagrams represent paths of particles
in the interaction area. Feynman himself was not particularly
interested in ontological questions.</p>

<h3><a name="FroParZoo">The Standard Model of Particle Physics</a></h3>

<p>

In the beginning of the 1950s QED had become a reliable theory which
no longer counted as preliminary. It took two decades from writing
down the first equations until QFT could be applied to interesting
physical problems in a systematic way. The new developments made it
possible to apply QFT to new particles and new interactions. In the
following decades QFT was extended to describe not only the
electromagnetic force but also weak and strong interaction so that new
Lagrangians had to be found which contain new classes of
&lsquo;particles&rsquo; or quantum fields. The research aimed at a
more comprehensive theory of matter and in the end at a unified theory
of all interactions. New theoretical concepts had to be introduced,
mainly connected with non-Abelian gauge theories and spontaneous
symmetry breaking. See also the entry
on <a href="../symmetry-breaking/index.html">symmetry and symmetry breaking</a>.
Today there are trustworthy theories of the strong, weak, and
electromagnetic interactions of elementary particles which have a
similar structure as QED. A combined theory associated with the gauge
group \(\text{SU}(3) \otimes \text{SU}(2) \otimes \text{U}(1)\) is
considered as &lsquo;the standard model&rsquo; of elementary particle
physics which was achieved by Glashow, Weinberg and Salam in 1962.
According to the standard model there are, one the one side, six types
of leptons (e.g. the electron and its neutrino) and six types of
quarks, where the members of both group are all fermions with spin
1/2. On the other side, there are spin 1 particles (thus bosons) that
mediate the interaction between elementary particles and the
fundamental forces, namely the photon for electromagnetic interaction,
two \(W\) and one \(Z\) boson for weak interaction, and the gluon for
strong interaction.  Altogether there is good agreement with
experimental data, for example the masses of \(W^+\) and \(W^-\)
bosons (detected in 1983) confirmed the theoretical prediction within
one per cent deviation.

<strong>Further Reading</strong>. The first chapter in Weinberg 1995
is a very good short description of the earlier history of QFT.
Detailed accounts of the historical development of QFT can be found,
e.g., in Darrigol 1986, Schweber 1994 and Cao 1997a. Various
historical and conceptual studies of the standard model are gathered
in Hoddeson <em>et al</em>. 1997 and of renormalization theory in
Brown 1993.</p>

<h2>The Epistemic Status of Self-Verifying Judgments</h2>

<p>
Predictably, Burge&rsquo;s view of self-verifying judgments is not
universally accepted. Indeed, some philosophers &ldquo;incredulously
stare&rdquo; at the idea that mere mortals can know anything
infallibly. But substance can be given to this resistance by targeting
Burge&rsquo;s <em>explanation</em> of the infallibility. Burge holds
that the relevant judgments are infallible in virtue of a
<em>self-referential</em> mechanism in the attribution (&ldquo;with
this very thought&rdquo;). This mechanism is supposedly what
&ldquo;locks&rdquo; the second-order judgment to the first-order
thought, thus ensuring that the judgment never misses its target. Yet
if the second-order judgment is self-referential, then this at best
explains why the second-order judgment is locked to <em>itself</em>.
It does not show why it is locked to the <em>first</em>-order thought
(Parent 2007; 2017, ch. 3).</p>

<p>
However, this problem can be avoided if the phrase &lsquo;with this
very thought&rsquo; in (W) is replaced with &lsquo;forthwith&rsquo;,
where the latter just denotes the first-order thought expressed by the
complement clause of (W). For that matter, &lsquo;with this very
thought&rsquo; could just be deleted. For plausibly, the second order
judgment has a compositional structure such that the first order
thought is literally an (ineliminable) <em>part</em> of the judgment.
If so, then tokening the second order judgment necessitates the
occurrence of the first-order thought&mdash;just in the way that
writing &lsquo;I am thinking that water is wet&rsquo; necessitates
writing down its complement clause &lsquo;water is wet&rsquo;. Since
the occurrence of the first order thought is precisely what the
judgment contends, the judgment is thus invariably true, i.e.,
infallible (Parent 2007; 2017, ch. 3).</p>

<p>
Besides having us know our thoughts too well, Burge is also criticized
for having us know our thoughts not well enough. For instance, it has
been suggested that a slow switch victim will not <em>understand</em>
her own first-order thought well enough to count as knowing it (Cassam
1994, Wikforss 2004 is also relevant). Others have complained that,
even if a self-verifying judgment is infallible, it is unclear whether
it qualifies as genuine <em>knowledge</em> (Brueckner 1990; 1994).</p>

<p>
On the latter issue, one might first allow that the relevant judgments
are de facto infallible for the reason Burge says. Yet consider that
if (W) is armchair-known, then (if knowledge is closed under known
entailment), one might ipso facto armchair-know that:</p>

<blockquote>
(W*) I am <em>not</em> currently thinking that water<sub>2</sub> is
wet.
</blockquote>

<p>
(Things are clearer here if we use &lsquo;water<sub>1</sub>&rsquo; to
express our Earthian concept and &lsquo;water<sub>2</sub>&rsquo;
express the Twin Earthian concept.) However, suppose a skeptic raises
the possibility of a slow switch, a scenario where your
water<sub>1</sub> thoughts have been stealthily switched to
water<sub>2</sub> thoughts. When taking this possibility seriously, it
seems an externalist cannot be confident about (W*) from the armchair.
Yet if she does not armchair-know this consequence of (W), then
(assuming epistemic closure) she does not armchair-know (W) itself
(Brueckner 1990; 1994, but contrast with Brueckner 2010).
Burge&rsquo;s second-order judgments hence fail as genuine knowledge,
and the compatibilist&rsquo;s case falters.</p>

<p>
The argument presses that Oscar does not know what he thinks if he
cannot discriminate between water<sub>1</sub> thoughts and
water<sub>2</sub> thoughts. This represents a kind of
&ldquo;discrimination requirement&rdquo; on knowledge (reminiscent of
Goldman 1976). And even armed with self-verifying judgments, Oscar
apparently cannot discriminate in this way. Yet if Oscar lacks this
discriminatory ability, then it seems he could be thinking one of two
different thoughts, for all he can know from the armchair. But
normally, Oscar may well know his thoughts even if he cannot so
discriminate, since water<sub>2</sub> thoughts are usually
&ldquo;irrelevant alternatives&rdquo; that are properly ignored. In
fact, adjudicating this relevant alternatives issue may be
<em>the</em> central task with slow switch arguments, and it is more
appropriate to discuss it separately (section
 <a href="index-2.html#Rep2RelAlt">3.2</a>).
 This controversy is certainly not unique to Burge&rsquo;s view.</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, in Burge&rsquo;s case, the discrimination issue is one
instance of a larger concern for his view. The problem is that an
infallible judgment does not obviously count as bona fide
<em>knowledge</em>. Besides discriminatory abilities, some kind of
<em>epistemic warrant</em> also seems necessary&mdash;and it is not
apparent how self-verifying judgments are warranted. However, Burge
(1996) uses here the notion of an &ldquo;epistemic entitlement&rdquo;
as what warrants a self-verifying judgment. These epistemic
entitlements are reminiscent of W.&rsquo;s proposal (from section
 <a href="index-2.html#Rep3TraFai">2.3</a>)
 that a speaker enjoys, somewhat automatically, a warrant to
one&rsquo;s self-attributions. Like W., Burge even describes this as
the &ldquo;default&rdquo; epistemic status, which need not be earned
via some tight, philosophical argument. However, Burge does not hold
merely that the default status is granted by a convention of the
&ldquo;language game.&rdquo; Rather, he attempts to explain the
entitlement further, as rooted not only in (a) the infallibility of
self-verifying judgments, but more notably in (b) the subject&rsquo;s
capacity for <em>critical reasoning</em>.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Critical reasoning&rdquo; is reasoning that occurs while aware
of one&rsquo;s reasons <em>as</em> reasons. Concordantly, critical
reasoning assumes that we make judgments about our thoughts and their
status as reasons. Yet that of course requires knowledge of what those
thoughts are (cf. Shoemaker 1988, Moran 2001). Indeed, without
knowledge of these thoughts, the attempt to critically evaluate them
seems absurd. But for Burge, entitlement to one&rsquo;s second-order
judgments arises in light of this. Since critical reasoning depends on
knowing the thoughts deployed, that establishes an epistemic
entitlement to our judgments about those thoughts. So the entitlement
is not seen as assigned merely by convention; it is instead
established by the need, within critical thinking, for knowledgeable
self-attributions.</p>

<p>
Of note, Burge holds that the entitlement persists even through
Oscar&rsquo;s slow switch ordeal. Yet it may not be obvious why or
even whether this is so. Moreover, some have raised a kind of
Euthyphro dilemma for Burge (Peacocke 1996). Is one entitled to
self-attributions because of their role in critical reasoning, as
Burge would have it? Or rather, do these attributions have this role
in critical reasoning because one is entitled to them? Contra Burge,
the latter can seem more plausible&mdash;and so, the entitlement may
need to be explained on independent grounds.Also, for a different
problem with Burge&rsquo;s view on critical reasoning, see the
supplementary document,
 <a href="supplement2.html">A Problem with Critical Reasoning</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Because of such problems, others have attempted alternative
explanations of our epistemic entitlement to self-verifying judgments.
For instance, one&rsquo;s explanation might emphasize
&ldquo;conceptual redeployment,&rdquo; i.e., that the very same
concepts occur in the self-attribution as occurs in the thought itself
(Peacocke 1996, although Burge 1998, p. 359 also utilizes this idea.)
Alternatively, such judgments could be seen as warranted in virtue of
their perfect reliability, in accord with a reliabilist epistemology
(Gibbons 1996, Brown 2004). Yet another option is to regard such
judgments as warranted in virtue of the target first-order states
being &ldquo;directly accessible&rdquo; (where this is spelled out in
functionalist terms) (Zimmerman 2006; 2008, cf. Shoemaker 1996).
Finally, some have suggested that a self-verifying judgment counts as
knowledge if, at the time of judgment, the subject is also
reflectively aware of its self-verifying nature (Goldberg 2005a;
2006a, Parent 2017, chs. 5 and 10).</p>

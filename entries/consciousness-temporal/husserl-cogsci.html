<p>

Husserl&rsquo;s tripartite conception of the (Retentionalist)
specious present has been influential, and in recent years there have
been a number of attempts to incorporate his insights into neurobiology
and cognitive science.</p>

<h3 id="VarVanGeld">1. Varela and van Gelder: retention without representation</h3>

<p>

Seeking to build bridges between the cerebral and the phenomenal,
Varela has proposed that there may be important analogies between the
dynamical behaviour of neural cell-assemblies and Husserl&rsquo;s
tri-partite conception of the phenomenal present. More
specifically, he suggests that these neuronal ensembles can become
synchronized for periods lasting around 1 second, and these transient
periods of synchrony are the neural correlates of present-time
consciousness (1999: 119). Husserl himself did not suggest that
the 1 second time-scale is privileged in any way, and it is not
immediately apparent what Varela&rsquo;s neuronal ensembles might have
in common with time-consciousness as described by Husserl.
Matters become clearer with Varela&rsquo;s claim that retentions may be
&lsquo;dynamical trajectories&rsquo;, although this takes a little
unpacking. (See Thompson 2007 chapter 11 for a sympathetic
exposition.)</p>

<p>

Neural networks are often assumed to be instances of the sort of
chaotic (or non-linear) systems whose behaviour has come under
increasing scrutiny in recent decades. Although such systems can
react in difficult-to-predict ways in response to the smallest of
stimuli, they often have a certain number of favoured states &ndash;
states they are more likely to enter into &ndash; and these correspond
to the &lsquo;attractors&rsquo; in the abstract phase spaces used to
describe their behaviour. The behaviour of a dynamic system
from one moment to the next depends on several factors: the
system&rsquo;s current global state, its tendency to move along certain
preferred trajectories through its phase space from any given location,
and external influences. So at any given point, a system&rsquo;s
behavioural dispositions are determined by its precise location in its
phase space, and its current location in its phase space is a function
of its previous locations. For this reason a system&rsquo;s
current phase-space trajectory can be viewed as reflecting its past:
&lsquo;in its current point in time a dynamical system has no
&ldquo;representation&rdquo; of its past. But the past acts into
the present &hellip; The present state wouldn&rsquo;t be what it is
except for its past, but the past is not actually present &hellip; and
is not represented&rsquo; (Varela 1999: 137). Husserl&rsquo;s
contention that the present contains remnants or retentions of the past
can seem puzzling, even paradoxical. How is it possible for
experienced succession to be generated by contents that exist only in
the momentary present? But if a system&rsquo;s present state can
<em>reflect</em> the recent past without actually or explicitly
<em>representing</em> it, the problem of how presently occurring
representations can perform the functions Husserl ascribes to them is
solved, or at least that is what Varela
 maintains.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-37" id="ref-37">37</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Van Gelder is another advocate of this <em>geometricization</em> of
retention. Commenting on how an artificial neural net can be
taught to recognize sounds, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

How is the past built in? By virtue of the fact that the current
position of the system is the culmination of a trajectory which is
determined by the particular auditory pattern (type) as it was
presented up to that point. In other words, retention is a geometric
property of dynamical systems: the particular <em>location</em> the
system occupies in the space of possible states when in the process of
recognizing the temporal object. It is that location, in its difference
with other locations, which &ldquo;stores&rdquo; in the system the
exact way in which the auditory pattern unfolded in the past. It is how
the system &ldquo;remembers&rdquo; where it came from. (1997:
&sect;38)</blockquote>

<p>

Van Gelder goes on to outline a number of other respects in which
the workings of dynamical (in this case, connectionist) systems
correspond to what Husserl had so say about the structure of temporal
awareness. While these analogies are certainly noteworthy, there
is a significant difficulty with the central claim. Dispensing
with anything resembling an explicit representation of a system&rsquo;s
prior states in its present state may make life easier, but for Husserl
the whole mystery or &lsquo;wonder&rsquo; of time-consciousness
consists in the way the past <em>lives on</em> in the present.
Van Gelder recognizes that there is nothing resembling a
&lsquo;perception&rsquo; of the past in his model, but he presents this
as a positive: he suggests Husserl&rsquo;s talk of perceptions of the
past is confused and unnecessary, and that he only used such
formulations because &lsquo;he had no better model of how something
could &ldquo;directly intend&rdquo; the past&rsquo; (1997: &sect;40).
Whether Husserl would have agreed with this verdict is
debatable.</p>

<h3 id="LloyConnRete">2. Lloyd: connectionist retentions</h3>

<p>

Lloyd is sympathetic to the overall approach taken by van Gelder and
Varela, but he finds something lacking:</p>

<blockquote>

Husserl&rsquo;s challenge to us is not to show how a difference in
the real past of a system can influence its present state &ndash; the
actual past is excluded along with the rest of the objective world at
the phenomenological get-go. Rather, Husserlian retention is the
presence (now) of an apparent past experience, the prior Now in all its
richness. So if a distributed pattern of activity is the network
Now, then retention is achieved only if that pattern is inflected by
<em>its own</em> prior Now-state, and not just some aspect of the prior
now, but all of it. (2004: 342)</blockquote>

<p>

Artificial neural nets can differ in their fundamental
architecture. A very simple <em>feed-forward</em> system will
contain an input layer of processing units, a single hidden layer
(where the computations or processing takes place) and an output
layer. In each cycle of activity, the units in each layer can
only be influenced by units below themselves, they cannot be influenced
from above, i.e. by units closer to the output layer. Since the
hidden layer&rsquo;s state is significantly changed by each new cycle
of inputs, it has no way of retaining detailed information about its
own prior state, and so is ill-suited to serve as an analogue of a
Husserlian &lsquo;now&rsquo;. A far more promising candidate,
Lloyd suggests (2004: 282), are the simple <em>recurrent networks</em>
described by Elman (1990). These comprise layers of input units,
output units and hidden units as per usual. They also, however,
include a layer of &lsquo;context units&rsquo; whose function it is to
record the exact state of the hidden units, and feed this information
forward to the hidden units in the next cycle of processing. (See
Figure 23 for a schematic depiction.) The processing layer is
simultaneously presented with the new input stimuli <em>and</em>
detailed information about its own prior state.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break">

<p><span class="figlabel">Figure 23.</span>
A simple recurrent network in which activations are
copied from hidden layer to context layer on a one-for-one basis
(Elman 1990: 184).</p>
</div>
 
<p>

Because this &lsquo;echo dates from one cycle ago, the next internal
state can enfold both present and past information. Then that new
internal state, combining present and just prior information, itself
recycles &hellip; In principle, this neuronal hall of mirrors can keep
a pattern alive indefinitely.&rsquo; (Lloyd 2004: 282). In
his own research Lloyd exposed a network of this sort &ndash; dubbed
&lsquo;CNVnet&rsquo; &ndash; to a large number of (suitably encoded)
&lsquo;beeps&rsquo; and &lsquo;boops&rsquo;. These signals
followed a fixed pattern: beeps come randomly, but are invariably
followed by boops a short (and fixed) period of time later. With
appropriate tweaking of connection weights, the network eventually had
no difficulty whatsoever in predicting the timing of a boop after any
given beep. Thanks to the combination of recursive and predictive
capacities, CVNet&rsquo;s hidden units can reflect both the past and
the future, in addition to the current cycle of inputs.</p>

<p>

Lloyd does not claim that his simple networks are actually
conscious, but he does see points of similarity with Husserl&rsquo;s
tripartite analysis of temporal awareness. Taking things a step
further, he set artificial networks the task of analyzing each
other. He created a <em>metanet</em>, tuned to respond to the
hidden units of the CNVnet. After the usual training (several
million cycles), the metanet proved able to extract three sorts of
information from the hidden units: the current input, the next output,
and (with less accuracy) a record of the layer&rsquo;s entire
<em>past</em> state. Might these not reasonably be taken to
correspond with Husserl&rsquo;s primal impressions, protentions and
retentions? Moving to real rather than artificial brains, Lloyd
(2002, 2004: ch.4) argues that it might prove possible to find some
confirming evidence for Husserl&rsquo;s analysis in the data pertaining
to the global condition of conscious brains that can be derived &ndash;
using sophisticated multidimensional scaling methods &ndash; from fMRI
scans. Simplifying a good deal, his working hypothesis is that if
our consciousness at any one moment contains a detailed representation
of its immediately prior states, this should be reflected in
<em>similarities</em> between the conditions of our brain over the
relevant short periods: &lsquo;images taken close together in time
should be more similar, compared to images separated by greater
temporal intervals&rsquo; (2004: 313). And, broadly speaking,
this is what he found. To round things off, he fed the fMRI data
to an artificial neural net. His aim, as with CVNnet, was to find
out whether the metanet could extract information about a brain&rsquo;s
<em>prior</em> states from a description of its later states.
Again the results were positive: &lsquo;Overall, the analysis suggests
that patterns of activation in the human brain encode past patterns of
activation, and particularly the immediate past&rsquo; (2004: 327).</p>

<h3 id="GrusTrajEsti">3. Grush: a trajectory estimation model</h3>

<p>

In a series of recent papers Grush moves in a rather different, more
classical direction (computationally speaking). Although he too
is sympathetic to Husserl&rsquo;s analysis of the phenomenal present,
he is highly critical of the efforts of Varela, van Gelder and
Lloyd. He reproaches a tendency in all three to assume without
sufficient further argument that we can draw conclusions about the
temporal properties of experiences (or of properties that are
represented in the contents of experiences) from facts pertaining to
the &lsquo;vehicles&rsquo; of these experiences, e.g., the neural
processes which underlie them (2006: 422). From the fact that a
global brain state bears traces of its recent past it does not
automatically follow that any experiences produced by this brain also
bear traces of their past. Consequently, before it is legitimate
to conclude that such a discovery about the brain vindicates the
Husserlian conception a compelling story needs to be told as how or why
the temporal features at the neural level transfer to the
phenomenal
 level.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-38" id="ref-38">38</a>]</sup>
There are more specific complaints. Lloyd&rsquo;s fMRI results,
Grush argues, may well be nothing more than an artefact of the way the
data was processed. As for the geometricization of retention
advocated by Varela and van Gelder, if the analysis were correct
&lsquo;every physical system in the universe would exhibit Husserlian
retention&rsquo; (2006:
 425)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-39" id="ref-39">39</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Grush&rsquo;s positive proposal comes in the form of the
&lsquo;trajectory estimation model&rsquo;, which draws on ideas and
analyses from control theory and signal processing &ndash; for further
details, see Grush (2005a, 2005b). The core idea is that a system
(e.g. a brain) has:</p>

<blockquote>

an internal model of the perceived entity (typically the environment
and entities in it, but perhaps also the body), and at each time
<em>t</em>, the state of the internal model embodies an estimate of the
state of the perceived domain. The model can be run off-line in
order to produce expectations of what the modelled domain might do in
this or that circumstances (or if this or that action were taken by the
agent); the model can also be run online, in parallel with the modelled
domain, in order to help filter noise from sensory signals, and in
order to overcome potential problems with feedback delays. (Grush 2006:
&sect;4)</blockquote>

<p>

So far as analogies with Husserl&rsquo;s doctrines are concerned, a
key point is that the internal model employed by these systems is not
confined to modelling <em>instantaneous</em> states of the relevant
domain. What is modelled, rather, is the <em>trajectory</em> of
the domain over a short interval of time, i.e., the entire succession
of states that the system estimates that domain is most likely to have
been in during the relevant interval. It is this trajectory
&ndash; which is a detailed representation, and so not to be confused
with the phase-space vectors of van Gelder and Varela &ndash; which
Grush takes to be the information-processing analogue of
Husserl&rsquo;s tri-partite specious presents. When construed in
experiential terms, an (online, parallel) trajectory is a
subject&rsquo;s course of experience over a brief interval, in the
manner indicated in Figure 24 below. At each of three distinct
times t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, t<sub>3</sub> a distinct trajectory
is modelled, ranging from t<sub>1</sub>-t<sub>5</sub>,
t<sub>2</sub>-t<sub>6</sub>, t<sub>3</sub>-t<sub>7</sub>
respectively. Within these trajectories,
&lsquo;t<sub>3</sub>&rsquo; denotes what the system is representing as
happening at t<sub>3</sub>, &lsquo;t<sub>2</sub>&rsquo; denotes what
the system is representing as happening at t<sub>2</sub>, and so
forth. These trajectories extend a short way into the past, but
also include projections (or expectations) about the likely future
course of experience, and in this manner reflect the protentional
aspect of Husserlian specious presents. As for the temporal
scope of these retentions and protentions, Grush suggests around a 100
msec in either direction is a plausible estimate. As in
previous cases of diagrams of this sort, for the sake of clarity only a
small sample of the actual representations is depicted; in reality the
representations are being produced continually, generating a gap-free
continuum of trajectories.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break">
<img alt="Figure24" src="Fig24.png" width="400" />
<p class="center"><span class="figlabel">Figure 24.</span></p>
</div>
 
<p>

Leaving aside their predictive capabilities, the trajectories (or
specious presents) Grush&rsquo;s systems produce from one moment to the
next are not simply passive reflections of current and past sensory
inputs. When producing their internal models of their
environments, many controlling systems &ndash; e.g., those used as
navigational aids on ships &ndash; have to rely on external sensors
which are supplying partial, fragmentary or less than entirely accurate
information concerning what is going on around them. Our brains
are typical in this respect: the signals they receive from our eyes,
ears and skin are very difficult indeed to interpret. To help
circumvent these obstacles, engineers build a variety of sub-systems
into control systems whose task it is to make the best of the imperfect
information available. For example, these sub-systems will smooth
out irregularities that are likely to be due to imperfect sensory data
rather than sudden and dramatic alterations in the external
environment, or fill-in holes or gaps by extrapolating from the
available data in the most plausible way. To accomplish this, the
relevant sub-systems will often themselves possess internal models of
likely courses of events and likely external environments. In
effect, in modelling current trajectories, these control systems rely
on models they already possess. As a consequence of this active
or interpretive stance, there is no guarantee that the trajectories
generated by a system will remain constant or consistent over
time. Since each trajectory represents a temporal interval, it is
quite possible that later trajectories will re-write or supersede
earlier trajectories, simply because the relevant control systems have
more (and perhaps better) information to work with. This
&lsquo;re-writing of the past&rsquo; is illustrated schematically in
the diagram above. What the system is representing as happening at
t<sub>3</sub> undergoes a change between t<sub>3</sub> and
t<sub>4</sub> &ndash; the change is signified by the switch to bold
font + underlining &ndash; and as can be seen, the revised version of
t<sub>3</sub> is preserved at t<sub>5</sub>.</p>

<p>

Grush argues that the abilities of his systems to generate different
(and incompatible) trajectories at different times is a positive boon,
for it allows his model to accommodate a variety of &lsquo;temporal
illusions&rsquo;. One such is the <em>cutaneous rabbit</em>
described by Geldard &amp; Sherrick (1972). The experiment
involved devices capable of delivering controlled brief (2 msec) pulses
to the skin being fitted along the arms of subjects.
Surprisingly, when the devices were clustered in just three tight
configurations &ndash; and the wrist, the elbow and in-between &ndash;
and five pulses were delivered to each location, rather than
experiencing three tight clusters of pulses (one at the wrist, one at
the elbow and one in-between) subjects report feeling a succession of
<em>evenly spaced</em> pulses starting at the wrist and terminating a
the elbow (and often seeming continue a bit further). There are
several questions that can be asked about this, but perhaps the most
puzzling is: what is happening at the time of the <em>second</em>
pulse? Although this actually occurs at the wrist, it is felt
further along the arm, but at the time the second pulse occurs the
brain can&rsquo;t yet know that pulses further along the arm will be
delivered. A similar problem is posed by the <em>colour phi</em>
phenomenon (Kolers &amp; von Gr&uuml;nau 1976, Dennett 1991:
114&ndash;123). When two differently coloured spots were flashed on and
off for 150 msec each &ndash; with a 50 msec gap &ndash; subjects
reported not only seeing a single spot moving back and forth (rather
than two distinct spots flashing on and off), they also saw the first
spot suddenly changing in colour mid-way along its path.
Evidently, at some level the brain is &lsquo;deciding&rsquo; that it is
more likely to be confronted with a single spot of light that is both
in motion and changing its colour than two flashing lights of different
colours. But how is the brain able to impose this interpretation
of events on experience <em>before</em> the second flash even
occurs? Grush&rsquo;s trajectory model has no difficulty
explaining what is going on in such cases. In the case of the
rabbit, the second pulse is initially represented as occurring at the
wrist. But as the brain updates its models in the light of
subsequent sensory information and its own expectations as to the
likely scenario confronting it, it alters its verdict and starts
representing the second pulse as occurring further along the arm, as
part of an evenly spaced succession. And when subjects are
subsequently queried as to what they experienced, it is the later
representations (or trajectories) which get reported &ndash; the
earlier representations are not remembered. The colour phi
phenomenon is susceptible to an analogous interpretation and
explanation: the earliest trajectories do not represent motion (or
<em>a fortiori</em> a mid-path change of colour) subsequent ones do,
and it is these which are
 reported.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-40" id="ref-40">40</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Taking a step back, the various attempts to put computational (or
even biological) flesh on the bones of Husserl&rsquo;s Retentional
model are certainly intriguing, and Grush makes out a plausible case
for supposing that our brains may contain internal modelling (or
emulation) systems similar to the ones he describes, at least from the
perspective of the sort of information processing they can carry
out. But what conclusions should we draw from this? It
would certainly be a mistake to conclude, without any further argument, that
the existence within our brains of information processing systems along
the lines of the trajectory estimation model entails that
Husserl&rsquo;s theory (or some other form of Retentional model) is
true. Grush was right to criticize Varela, van Gelder and Lloyd
for paying insufficient attention to the distinction between brains and
the properties possessed by (or represented in) the experiences brains
produce. From the fact that momentary global brain states retain
traces of their recent past, we cannot conclude &ndash; without further
argument &ndash; that momentary phases of experiences do
likewise. A precisely analogous point can be made with regard to
information processing models. Suppose our brains do contain
(what are in effect) data-structures representing in quite detailed
ways their environments (external and bodily) over short
intervals. Let us further suppose that these data-structures are
embodied in momentary phases of our brains, and are updated on a
moment-to-moment basis (or at least, at time-scales shorter by far than
the specious present). Should we conclude that our the contents
of momentary (or very brief) phases of our streams of
consciousness <em>also</em> reflect intervals of time, the same
intervals as are represented in the data-structures? Not without
a good deal of further argument. After all, the relationship between
the phenomenal and the <em>computational</em> levels is as unclear and
disputed as the relationship between the phenomenal and the
<em>physical</em> (or neuronal) levels. Some realists about the
phenomenal &ndash; e.g. Searle &ndash; reject any significant link
between computation and experience; even those who think there is some
significant relationship between information processing and experience
may resist the claim that <em>all</em> instances of information
processing are associated with experience. It is thus an option
for the Extensional theorist to say:</p>

<blockquote>

Yes, our brains may well contain continually updated
representations (in informational or computational form) of our
internal and external environments; it may well be that at any one time
it is possible to find in the brain data-structures corresponding to
courses of events over brief periods of time; it may also be the case
that these data-structures impact on our behaviour. But since we
cannot conclude from this that our <em>experience</em> at any one
moment embodies the data found in these structures, it may well be that
our experience of change and persistence is itself temporally extended,
in the way that Extensional models predict.</blockquote>

<p>

Until the relationship between matter, information processing and
phenomenal consciousness is settled, this response cannot be
dismissed.</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">The Limits of Law</a></h2>

 Both Hart and Alexander would surely not deny the point made in the
text, viz. that wrongdoing or immorality, for the legal moralist,
makes for a <em>prima facie</em> or <em>pro tanto</em> ground, rather
than a conclusive one. But, as stated in the text, no formulation of
the position should omit this as it is central to the legal moralism
of Devlin, Moore, and others. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Both Devlin and Hart use the term &ldquo;prima facie&rdquo;, rather
than &ldquo;pro tanto&rdquo;, which is more normally used today (e.g.,
Tadros 2016a: 100). <em>Pro tanto</em> is preferred today for the term
<em>prima facie</em> can be ambiguous. &ldquo;Prima facie&rdquo; is
sometimes used to mean: &ldquo;on the face of it&rdquo;, or &ldquo;on
initial appearances&rdquo;, or some such. This implies that the aspect
of a situation that grounded the right or obligation or whatever, may
turn out on fuller inspection to be illusory. But this is not what
Devlin or Hart had in mind, so this meaning must be put to one side.
The other meaning&mdash;that which is now more commonly associated
with the term <em>pro tanto</em>&mdash;in no way implies that the
immorality that grounds the right or whatever may turn out to have
been a mirage. What may happen instead is that it may be defeated when
all things are considered. There is an obligation or right etc
&ldquo;inasmuch as there is this or that aspect of the situation, but
&hellip; suspending the all-in verdict.&rdquo; (Blackburn 1994: 301).
Hence, if one were to say on this view queue jumping is wrongful but
should not be criminal because not sufficiently serious, too expensive
to enforce, intrusive in people&rsquo;s everyday lives etc, the
immorality turns out not to have sufficient strength to be made
criminal, but the wrongness subsists&mdash;it was no illusion. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 But see Tadros (2016a: 91&ndash;134), for a largely sceptical
exploration of all principles of the sort, be they from proponents of
the harm principle, legal moralists or others. </p>

 <em>Bowers v. Hardwick,</em> 478 U.S 186 (1986), in which a Georgia
law against sodomy was upheld by the U.S Supreme Court. The Supreme
Court subsequently overturned the decision in <em>Lawrence v
Texas</em>, 539 U.S. 558 (2003). </p>

 In 1967 the Sexual Offences Act was passed by the UK Parliament,
decriminalizing (for England and Wales) adult homosexual conduct in
private. This followed a decade of debate&mdash;notably including Hart
and Devlin&mdash;over the government-commissioned Wolfenden Report
(1957), which recommended decriminalization. It is not widely
appreciated in the literature that two years before the 1967 Act
became law&mdash;also the year of publication of Devlin&rsquo;s
<em>Enforcement of Morals</em>&mdash;Devlin publicly joined with a
group of other law lords to urge Parliament to <em>implement</em>
Wolfenden and <em>decriminalize</em> (Devlin, Birmingham et al. 1965).
In the <em>Enforcement of Morals</em> itself, Devlin officially
declines to state a view on the decriminalization of homosexuality,
though he hints at his view in favour, as he confirms in the Preface
(Devlin 1965: ix&mdash;see the paragraph ending with the words;
&ldquo;and that is the point of the paragraph&rdquo;; see also Sackar
2020: 203&ndash;209). But with the occasional exception (e.g., Moffat
2005) it is widely and erroneously held in the literature that Devlin
actively opposed decriminalization. Thus, Leslie Green and Brian
Leiter take it that Devlin opposed as a matter of policy the
decriminalization of consensual gay sex (Green &amp; Leiter 2005).
Wendy Donner thought, for Devlin, criminalization of homosexuality was
&ldquo;required&rdquo; (Donner 2008: 157); Martha Nussbaum in two
monographs speaks of Devlin&rsquo;s &ldquo;most famous
recommendation&rdquo;, namely &ldquo;the prohibition of consensual
homosexual acts&rdquo; (Nussbaum 2004: 351) and asserts that Devlin
&ldquo;strongly opposed&rdquo; the Wolfenden Commission&rsquo;s
proposal &ldquo;to decriminalize consensual same-sex sexual
acts&rdquo; (Nussbaum 2010: xiii); according to Chad Flanders, Devlin
&ldquo;would not in the end adopt the point of view of the Wolfenden
Report&rdquo; (Flanders 2016: 49). Vincent Chiao speaks of the
&ldquo;acts of [sexual deviance] Devlin would have us consider
criminal&rdquo; (Chiao 2019: 169). And Gerald
Dworkin&mdash;sympathetic enough to Devlin&rsquo;s wider argument to
write a paper entitled &ldquo;Devlin was Right&rdquo;&mdash;regrets
that, on the policy question, Devlin opposed the implementation of
Wolfenden, adding: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I side with Hart, against Devlin, in believing that the conduct in
question (i.e., homosexual sex) should not be criminalized. (G.
Dworkin 1999: 928) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But on <em>that</em> question Devlin sided with Hart too! None of the
above authors appear aware of Devlin&rsquo;s 1965 public advocacy of
decriminalization. Robert Moffat, who was aware of it, assumes Devlin
changed his mind on the question, an assumption that is contradicted
by Devlin himself in his private correspondence (Moffat 2005: 1107;
Sackar 2020: 203, 209). In short, Devlin&rsquo;s view (whatever one
thinks of it) was that the criminal law <em>should</em> tolerate gay
sex in private, not&mdash;as is widely thought&mdash;that it should
<em>not</em> tolerate it. On toleration in this and other contexts,
see Green 2008.</p>. And see further s2.2 and 3 in the main text.

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 It is nevertheless interesting to note how demanding a test Devlin
appeared to think this was. For the beliefs about homosexuality that
he is assuming are those of Britain in the late 1950s. It is
interesting to compare what we can surmise about those beliefs with
the corresponding beliefs in Britain today. Authoritative twenty-first
century opinion, in the shape of the publication <em>British Social
Attitudes</em>, suggests around two thirds&mdash;and the figure
continues to rise&mdash;of the British population believes
homosexuality is not morally wrong at all (Curtice et al. 2019: 9).
There were no such figures from 1959, but as late as 1983, nearly a
quarter of a century <em>after</em> Devlin was writing, the figure had
only just passed one sixth of the population&mdash;a paltry 17% of the
population thought gay sex not morally &ldquo;wrong at all&rdquo;. Had
there been a 1959 figure, then, it would probably have been in single
figures. Despite this, Devlin did not consider the late 1950s/early
1960s moral beliefs widespread or intense <em>enough</em> to put
consensual homosexual sex beyond toleration (Devlin, Birmingham, et
al. 1965). By contrast, as stated in the text, he did think such
beliefs widespread and intense enough in relation to animal cruelty.

 &ldquo;Negative liberty is the absence of obstacles, barriers or
constraints. One has negative liberty to the extent that actions are
available to one in this negative sense. Positive liberty is the
possibility of acting&mdash; or the fact of acting&mdash;in such a way
as to take control of one&rsquo;s life and realize one&rsquo;s
fundamental purposes.&rdquo; (Carter 2019).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Devlin did not seem to realize that the educated elite espousing
&ldquo;rationalist morality&rdquo; could raise the question of whether
there can be moral expertise (Ryle 1958; McGrath 2019). He does not then
consider a range of possible ways his concern with the ordinary jury
member as decision maker could be accommodated, for example, as in
potential reflective equilibrium with the standards identified by the
&ldquo;rationalists&rdquo;. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 But see Lukes and Devyani 2012, who argue that a related argument by
Emile Durkheim, criticized by Hart together with his critique of
Devlin, can be understood and defended as an empirical thesis, at
least in part. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 As far as natural law theories are concerned, they are not always
easy to categorize as legal moralist theories or versions of the harm
principle. John Finnis, for example, claims that Aquinas argued for a
principle that was not &ldquo;readily distinguishable&rdquo; from
Mill&rsquo;s harm principle (Finnis 1998: 228). Finnis also reads
Aquinas as asserting that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
those vices of disposition and conduct which have no sufficient
relationship, direct or indirect to justice and peace are not concerns
of government or law. (Finnis 1998: 228) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are also, of course, divine command theories. As we have seen
Devlin simply assumed, without argument, impartiality in matters of
religion. Robert Adams, a leading exponent of divine command theory,
supports something close to Raz&rsquo;s version of the harm
principle&mdash;which we examine below (Adams 1999:
318&ndash;350).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Raz allows that some offensive behaviour can be by its nature harmful
and therefore a candidate for coercion on that basis, but he disallows
offence as an independently valid ground. Judith Thomson suggests that
Feinberg might be better off taking a similar line (Thomson 1986).
Simester and Von Hirsch have argued, like Feinberg, for the
independent validity of the offence principle, but suggest significant
changes to Feinberg&rsquo;s position (Simester and Von Hirsch,
2002).</p>

 Devlin is at his most instrumentalist in the following passage: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The arm of the law is an instrument to be used by society, and the
decision about what particular cases it should be used in is
essentially a practical one. Since it is an instrument, it is wise
before deciding to use it to have regard to the tools with which it
can be fitted and to the machinery which operates it. (Devlin 1965:
20)</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">al-Farabi&rsquo;s Philosophy of Society and Religion</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 The adjective <em>madaniyya</em> (fem. of <em>madani</em>) derives
from the noun <em>madina</em> (literally city). As such,
<em>madina</em> is the Arabic term for Greek <em>polis</em>; the
adjective <em>madani</em> renders <em>politik&#275;</em>. For a
discussion of the implications of these terms, see Rudolph 2012a:
444&ndash;447; Gutas 2004.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 In this connection, the distinction between &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;
(<em>kamil</em>) and &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; (<em>fadil</em>) should
be emphasized: while &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; in the quoted passages
refers to the completeness of the starting conditions,
&lsquo;excellent&rsquo; indicates the soundness of the pursued goal,
corresponding to the natural <em>telos</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 The distinction in the <em>Attainment</em> is more precisely between
&ldquo;earthly happiness in this life and supreme happiness in the
life beyond&rdquo; (<em>Attainment</em> i, 1: 13). From the overall
conception, to be fleshed out in
 <a href="index-2.html#BeinManSociCosm">section 3.1</a>,
 it would appear that &ldquo;earthly happiness&rdquo; corresponds to
the well-being of the <em>madina</em> and all its parts, whereas
&ldquo;supreme&rdquo; or &ldquo;ultimate happiness&rdquo; designates
individual felicity of the hereafter. Al-Farabi moreover distinguishes
between presumed and true happiness, particularly to discriminate
excellent from deficient societies; for this see the indications in
 <a href="index-2.html#ReliRule">section 4.2</a>;
 cf. <em>Enumeration</em> 3: 78.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 In his extant writings, al-Farabi regularly refers to the afterlife.
It should, however, be noted that there is some dispute in the
scholarship as to whether al-Farabi himself, actually, subscribes to
the idea of an afterlife or rather rejects it; see now Vallat 2020:
61&ndash;65: cf. also Rudolph 2012a: 440&ndash;442, for an overview
and reference to core positions. As the present entry is based on
al-Farabi&rsquo;s extant writings and since these explicitly mention
the hereafter and connect true, individual happiness with this state,
his theory will be presented accordingly. This is not to deny the
possibility that in other writings, which nowadays are lost (such as
his commentary on the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, which is at the
basis of this dispute), al-Farabi defended a different view.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 In general, al-Farabi accepts Greek ancient cosmology, according to
which the cosmos can be divided into a sublunary and a supralunary
sphere. While the sublunary sphere is constituted by the four elements
(earth, water, air, fire) and determined by the natural laws, the
supralunary sphere is&mdash;with the exception of the ether (a
quasi-matter of which, for instance, the bodies of the stars and
planets consist)&mdash;immaterial and inhabited by the so-called
&lsquo;separate intelligences or intellects&rsquo;, such as the
&lsquo;active intellect&rsquo; (on which more below). With their
circular movements, the celestial bodies (chiefly, the planets, the
sun, and the moon) causally determine matter and, thus, the natural
laws of the sublunary sphere. A classic example of this is the tides
which are brought about by the lunar cycle. For al-Farabi&rsquo;s
cosmology, see Janos 2012.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 The active intellect, on this theory, is the last (in order of
emanation) of the separate intelligences or intellects. In contrast to
the celestial bodies (planets, sun, moon), it does not directly
influence corporeal entities of the sublunary sphere, but instead the
human soul endowed with intellect and imagination. The active
intellect is simultaneously the cause of existence of the individuals
inhabiting the sublunary sphere (in Avicenna&rsquo;s words, it is the
&ldquo;giver of the forms&rdquo;) and the active principle, introduced
into psychology by Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>De anima</em>, which
actualizes the human intellect. For al-Farabi&rsquo;s particular views
on these two topics, see the entries on his metaphysics and
psychology.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 There is a question about whether &ldquo;the faculty&rdquo; (i.e.,
the intellect&rsquo;s basic capacity to receive the intelligibles in
intellectual abstraction and, thus, to think in actuality) and
&ldquo;the principle&rdquo; (i.e., &ldquo;the primary sciences and the
primary intelligibles&rdquo;) by means of which human beings can think
in a deductive fashion are one and the same or rather two distinct
things. See, for instance, Taylor 2006.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 As adumbrated in note 6, the source of inspiration as well as
theoretical background of al-Farabi&rsquo;s psychology is
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>De anima</em>. Accordingly, in Aristotle&rsquo;s
vein, al-Farabi believes that the human intellect, in order to
actually think and understand, needs to be actualized (and, thus,
becomes an &ldquo;intellect in actuality&rdquo;). If someone, say, an
aspiring philosopher, consistently applies her intellect and
apprehends an increasingly greater number of intelligibles (objects of
knowledge), her intellect attains to a certain level, which al-Farabi
dubs the &ldquo;acquired intellect&rdquo; (<em>&lsquo;aql
mustafad</em>). At this level, the human intellect most nearly
resembles in its essence the separate, cosmic intelligences and,
particularly, the active intellect. For further details see the entry
on al-Farabi&rsquo;s psychology.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 According to the <em>Selected Aphorisms</em> 81: 52&ndash;3, this
state&mdash;which essentially corresponds to the level of the acquired
intellect, see previous note&mdash;can already be attained in this
life:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[Separation of the soul from the body] pertains only to the soul
particularly characteristic of the human being (which is to say, not
to the soul of non-human animals, NG), namely, the theoretical
intellect. For when it comes to this state, it becomes separated from
the body regardless of whether that body is living in that it is
nourished and is sense perceptive, or whether the faculty by which it
is nourished and is sense perceptive has already been abolished. For
if with respect to anything pertaining to its actions it comes not to
need sense perception or imagination (i.e., if it has reached the
level of the acquired intellect, NG), it will already have come to the
afterlife.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The connection of this state of separation with ultimate felicity will
become clear in the following two paragraphs. In his <em>Book of
Religion</em> 11: 101, by contrast, al-Farabi insists that true
happiness does only come about in the afterlife (note that there he
does not refer to his intellect theory):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The latter (namely, happiness, NG) is the one sought for its own sake;
at no time is it sought in order to obtain something else by it;
indeed, all other things are sought in order to obtain this one, and
when it is obtained, the search is given up; it does not come about in
this life, but rather in the next life which is after this one; and it
is called ultimate happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Note that this is the level of the aforementioned acquired intellect;
see the previous note with the quotation from the <em>Selected
Aphorisms</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Cf. similarly <em>Political Regime</em> B, 2, 78: 67, summarizing the
natural obligations of every human being under the following three
headings:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; [every human being] needs to know happiness and to set it
before his eyes as his end. Then, after that, he needs to know the
things that ought to be done so as to gain happiness by means of them,
then to perform those deeds.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Regarding his epistemology and theory of cognition, al-Farabi closely
follows Aristotle. As a consequence, knowledge in the strict sense of
the term requires understanding of the reason why <em>S</em> is the
case (with <em>S</em> being a given state of affairs). It is, thus, an
epistemic state which presupposes mastery of the respective science
(<em>epist&#275;m&#275;</em>).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 On these issues still see with benefit Adams 1844&ndash;1847.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Al-Farabi himself makes the link to trades and professions (or, in
his terminology: the arts, corresponding to the Greek
<em>techn&#275;</em>) in connection with the above quote (<em>Perfect
State</em> V, 16, 5: 267), where he points out that happiness can
differ in excellence. The last sentence of the above quote and its
immediate sequel reads (ibid. 267&ndash;8):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The kinds of felicity are unequal &hellip;; this is similar to the
difference of the arts in this world of ours. The arts differ in
excellence according to their species &hellip;: as, for example,
weaving and the art of drapery, the art of making perfumes and drugs
and the art of sweeping; &hellip;. Moreover the people who practice
the arts which belong to the same species are unequal in excellence
with regard to the quantity of their knowledge. &hellip;. Difference
in quality means that two have knowledge of the parts of the
secretarial art, but one of them is more proficient and better trained
than the other. This then is meant by difference in quality. The kinds
of felicity are also unequal in excellence in these respects.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 I.e., &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; (<em>fadil</em>) and not only
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo; (<em>kamil</em>), see
 <a href="#note-2">note 2</a>
 above.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 In contrast to his model Aristotle, al-Farabi is convinced that every
human being can, in a way (see below,
 <a href="index-2.html#KnowThinVersSymbRepr">section 3.2</a>),
 fulfill her natural duties, including the knowledge requirement. He
follows Aristotle neither in distinguishing between masters and
slaves, nor between men and women. To the contrary, he even explicitly
underscores that, as to the human rational faculty, men and women are
equally gifted (while he nowhere explicitly mentions slaves), see
<em>Perfect State</em> IV, 12, 8: 197: &ldquo;But in the case of the
faculty of sense, the faculty of representation and the faculty of
reason male and female do not differ&rdquo;. A recent analysis of
al-Farabi&rsquo;s notion of <em>umma</em> (society, community, nation,
or the like) is offered by Orwin 2017.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 It may be worth noting that the problem of free will (and act) was a
point that was avidly debated in early Islamic theology. Al-Farabi
basically sides with the Mu&lsquo;tazilites, a group which in his age
became gradually marginalized, and rejects those positions which would
increasingly dominate mainstream Sunni thought (Ash&lsquo;arism). For
further reference, see <em>s.v.</em> in <em>Encyclopaedia of
Islam</em> (online resource). For al-Farabi&rsquo;s position on free
will, see Griffel 2009, particularly 139&ndash;141. Al-Farabi
addresses this issue in his <em>Commentary</em> on Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>On Interpretation</em>, particularly 76&ndash;78 and
91&ndash;96.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 The term &lsquo;over-perfect&rsquo; is my own, applied in order to
underscore the unique position ascribed to the first cause by
al-Farabi; see, particularly, his <em>Perfect State</em> I, 1:
57&ndash;89, here, for instance, p. 59: &ldquo;The First Existent is
different in its substance from everything else, and it is impossible
for anything else to have the existence it has&rdquo;. For an analysis
of al-Farabi&rsquo;s conflicting accounts on the first cause, see
Janos 2012: 180&ndash;189.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 In the background of this notion is the ancient theory of climes (cf.
Aristotle, <em>Meteorology</em> II, 5, 362a32-b9); for a general
introduction see, for instance, Neugebauer 1975.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 This is to say, that they are &lsquo;informed&rsquo; by the active
intellect as described above,
 <a href="index-2.html#HappAfte">section 2.1</a>,
 i.e., that their minds have successfully received the basic
&lsquo;formatting&rsquo; (the primary sciences and primary
intelligibles) by virtue of which only the process of reasoning can be
carried out. The expression &lsquo;<em>compos mentis</em>&rsquo; is
borrowed from Reinhart 1995.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 Cf. above,
 <a href="index-2.html#HappAfte">section 2.1</a>,
 with the reference to the different degrees of happiness,
corresponding to the degree of excellence achieved during one&rsquo;s
lifetime. Accordingly, the accomplished philosophers, with their true
and scientific understanding of what there is, will experience greater
intellectual pleasures than less gifted people (e.g., weavers or
sweepers); nonetheless, these latter are also sufficiently equipped to
attain felicity in the afterlife. For a similar conclusion, see also
Vallat 2020.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 Cf., for instance, <em>Attainment</em> iii, 39: 35: &ldquo;There are
two primary methods of realizing them (i.e., the &lsquo;particular
instances&rsquo; of the theoretical and practical virtues and arts,
NG): instruction and the formation of character. To instruct is to
introduce the theoretical virtues in nations and cities. The formation
of character is the method of introducing the moral virtues and
practical arts in nations&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 Cf. above with
 <a href="#note-3">note 3</a>,
 the notion of earthly happiness (<em>Attainment</em> i, 1: 13).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 Cf. also, in this connection, al-Farabi&rsquo;s comparison of the
excellent ruler and her task <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em> society with
the first cause and its cosmic function, e.g., <em>Political
Regime</em> B, 3, 88: 73:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It (i.e., the city, ordered by the excellent ruler, NG) comes to
resemble the natural existents, and its rankings also resemble the
rankings of the existents that begin at the first [cause] and
terminate at primary material and the elements. The way it is tied
together and its consonance are similar to the way the different
existents are tied to one another and to their consonance. And the
governor of that city is similar to the first cause through which the
rest of the existents exist. (square brackets thus in the
translation)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-25">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 If ultimate felicity can be attained already before death (cf.
 <a href="#note-9">note 9</a>
 above), the excellent ruler is among those who are in this state.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 Al-Farabi distinguishes between the first ruler&mdash;the founder of
a community&mdash;and his successors. While these successors must be
philosophers, just like the first ruler, they need not be gifted with
prophecy, i.e., the revelation of a new <em>milla</em>; see Jorgenson
2019.</p>

 Nor can it be mistaken for something like &ldquo;religious
experience, religious consciousness, and faith&rdquo; (Stella 2019:
57). Bouhafa 2019: 13 suggests translating <em>milla</em> as
&ldquo;belief-based community&rdquo;, however, in practice, the term
refers to a society&rsquo;s foundational beliefs and laws rather than
to the community itself.</p>

&ldquo;immaterial existents&rdquo; (i.e., the separate intellects) are
among the things everyone must know in order to attain felicity.</p>

 Note that <em>subjectively</em> speaking, someone adhering to a
specific religion will feel as certain about her religion&rsquo;s
tenets as a philosopher defending a specific position by virtue of
demonstrative syllogisms. What is at stake here, however, is
(ultimately deriving from Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Posterior
Analytics</em>) the <em>objective</em> epistemic status of judgments,
which corresponds to opinion and conviction in the first case, in
contrast to science and certitude in the second.</p>

 On al-Farabi&rsquo;s take on the relation between philosophy and
religion in general, see Janssens 2014; on his concept of similitude
and imitation in particular (corresponding to the Greek
<em>mimesis</em>)&mdash;which is at the basis of his theory of
prophecy&mdash;and its (Neo-)Platonic precursors, see Jorgenson
2019.</p>

 Cf. <em>Book of Religion</em> 4: 97 (slightly modified): &ldquo;Thus
the determined opinions in the excellent religion are either the truth
or a likeness of the truth&rdquo;. For instance, even though, on this
account, the Qur&rsquo;an speaks about God chiefly in a metaphorical
fashion (e.g., referring to His throne, His hand, etc.), occasionally,
it addresses the truth directly, for example, when it insists on
God&rsquo;s absolute oneness and categorically rejects any form of
polytheism.</p>

 On the correspondence between &lsquo;pre-philosophical&rsquo;,
ethical opinions and &lsquo;philosophical&rsquo; practical science,
see Mattila 2017, building on Druart 1997 and 1995.</p>

 At the basis of this idea is al-Farabi&rsquo;s theory of language and
logic. Accordingly, there are different levels on which argumentation
can be located: scientific argumentation must be rooted in
demonstration (<em>sullogismos</em> in the sense of Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Posterior Analytics</em>). It excels by <em>(a)</em> being deduced
from absolutely certain, self-evident, first principles, and
<em>(b)</em> carried through by virtue of those logical figures which
allow for necessary conclusions. As a consequence, these conclusions
cannot be otherwise and, hence, are likewise absolutely certain. In
contrast to demonstration, the remaining types of argumentation,
namely, dialectics, rhetoric, and poetics, operate by means of weaker
premises (e.g., probable, generally accepted) and less cogent logical
figures, since they primarily aim at conviction, only secondarily at
truth absolutely. Poetics is the weakest of these kinds, as it only
appeals to imagination and thus seeks to arouse the listener&rsquo;s
consent; cf. Black 1990.</p>

 Cf. <em>Book of Religion</em> 7: 98&ndash;9:</p>

<blockquote>
It may happen accidentally that the first ruler does not determine all
of the actions and give an exhaustive account of them, but determines
most of them; &hellip;. Since not everything that can occur does occur
in his time or in his country, many things remain that could occur in
another time or in another country, each needing a specifically
determined action, and he will have legislated nothing about them. Or
else he devotes himself to those actions he presumes or knows to be
fundamental, from which someone else can extrapolate the remaining
ones: he legislates about the manner and amount of what ought to be
done with these and leaves the rest, knowing that it will be possible
for someone else to extrapolate them by adopting his intention and
following in his footsteps.
</blockquote>

The striking structural parallels with Islamic law and the principles
(<em>usul al-fiqh</em>) on which it is based are discussed in Arfa

 On al-Farabi&rsquo;s account, philosophy was completed by Plato and,
particularly, by Aristotle both in terms of content and method. It is
for this reason that he maintains in his <em>Book of Letters</em> (so
far there is no English translation of this work; C.E. Butterworth has
announced a revised second edition with facing English translation)
that there is no longer any need for philosophy to inquire into things
unknown (for there are none left). Instead, philosophy is an art to be
taught and studied. In his <em>Philosophy of Aristotle</em> (in
Alfarabi 1962: 71&ndash;130), he differentiates more thoroughly: as a
matter of fact, even Aristotle left some fields of knowledge
unexplored. Therefore, beyond teaching and studying, the philosopher
in al-Farabi&rsquo;s age is additionally called to fill in these
gaps.</p>

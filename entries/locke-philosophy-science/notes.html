<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Locke&rsquo;s Philosophy of Science</a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>  Throughout this section,
I am indebted to the insightful discussions of Margaret Osler,
&ldquo;John Locke and the Changing Ideal of Scientific
Knowledge&rdquo; (1970), and Peter Dear, Chapter 1, <em>Discipline and
Experience</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>  See also Osler on this
point: &ldquo;Implicit in his claim that we possess scientific
knowledge when &lsquo;we know the cause on which the fact depends, as
the cause of that fact and no other&rsquo; is the further claim that
scientific knowledge comprises knowledge of the essential natures of
things; for, without such knowledge, how could we know the ultimate
causes of the facts in question?&rdquo; (Osler 1970, p.4)</p>


<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>  On this point, see
Dear&rsquo;s discussion, <em>Discipline and Experience</em>,
pp. 22&ndash;23: &ldquo;True scientific knowledge should be
demonstratively certain, which required that its premises themselves
be certain.  Natural philosophy, however, as later scholastic writers
often admitted, tended to fall short of this idea because of the
merely &lsquo;probable&rsquo; status of many of its experiential
principles; it then represented &lsquo;dialectical&rsquo; rather than
demonstrative reasoning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>  On monstrous
occurrences, see Dear, <em>Discipline and Experience</em>, pp. 18 and
20&ndash;21.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>  Dear discusses the
variety of phenomena that could serve as experience: &ldquo;For
Aristotle, the nature of experience depended on its embeddedness in
the community; the world was construed through communal eyes.
Experience provided phenomena, and phenomena were, literally,
<em>data</em>, &lsquo;givens&rsquo;; they were statements about how
things behave in the world&hellip;.The sources of phenomena were
diverse, including common opinion and the assertions of philosophers as
well as personal sense perception&rdquo; (Dear, <em>Discipline and
Experience</em>, p. 23).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>  On Aristotle, see, for
example, Robin Smith&rsquo;s interpretation. Aristotle avoids the
regress threatened by a demonstration&rsquo;s experience-based
premises because he holds that &ldquo;our minds are already so
constituted as to be able to recognize the right objects, just as our
eyes are already so constituted as to be able to perceive the colors
that exist&rdquo;; experience &ldquo;actualizes the relevant
potentialities in the soul&rdquo; (Smith, &ldquo;Aristotle&rsquo;s
Logic&rdquo;, SEP). For the conception of knowledge extending from
Aristotle, see Osler, &ldquo;John Locke and the Changing Ideal of
Scientific Knowledge&rdquo; (1970). She identifies the following
epistemological assumptions grounding the Aristotelian conception:
&ldquo;(1) that the world corresponds to our conceptions, and (2)
that, consequently, it is possible for us to know the real natures of
essences of substances existing in the world&rdquo; (Osler 1970,
p. 3).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>  See Park and Daston,
pp. 3&ndash;4 on this point: &ldquo;The medieval Latin
<em>scientia</em>, although cognate with the modern English
&ldquo;science&rdquo;, referred to any rigorous and certain body of
knowledge that could be organized (in precept though not always in
practice) in the form of syllogistic demonstrations from self-evident
premises. Under this description, rational theology belonged to
<em>scientia</em>&mdash;indeed, it was the &lsquo;queen of
sciences&rsquo;&mdash;because its premises were the highest and most
certain. Excluded, however, were disciplines that studied
empirical particulars, such as medical therapeutics, natural history
and alchemy, because there can be no absolute certainty about
particular phenomena&rdquo; (Park and Daston, pp. 3&ndash;4).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>  On the use of
 experiments to reveal fundamental principles in connection with
 demonstrations, see Wisan 1978; Jardine 1991, p. 110; Dear 1995,
 p. 22 and chapter 5.  The extent and purposes of Galileo&rsquo;s
 experiments has become a focus of investigation and some controversy.
 Recent discussions include Palmieri 1998; 2009; Van Dyck
 2005.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>  As Osler writes,
&ldquo;During the Renaissance and seventeenth century, the growth of
empirical investigation, especially in natural history, yielded
less-than-certain knowledge about the world, making it increasingly
difficult to assimilate natural philosophy into the Aristotelian
apodictic model for science&rdquo; (Osler 1998, p. 91).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>  Responding to an
objection about the conflict of his law with observations, Descartes
writes: &ldquo;It often happens that experience can seem initially to
be incompatible with the rules which I have just explained, but the
reason for this is obvious. For the rules presuppose that the two
bodies B and C are perfectly hard and are so separated from all other
bodies that there is none other in their vicinity which could either
help or hinder their movement. And we see no such situation in this
world&rdquo; (AT IXB 93, translated and discussed in Desmond Clarke,
&ldquo;Descartes&rsquo; philosophy of science&rdquo;,
<em>Cambridge Companion to Descartes</em>, p. 269).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>  Mandelbaum
writes &ldquo;It was&hellip;characteristic of Descartes&rsquo; ideal of
knowledge&hellip;[that] effects were to be explained through their
causes, that is, properties through the substances which served as
their grounds. However, Boyle reversed this order, and insisted that
knowledge proceed from effects to causes; knowledge for him was to be
observational and empirical, not rational. Locke wholly agreed with
Boyle&rsquo;s method. It was because he agreed with this method, and
because he none the less adopted the stricter Cartesian definition of
&lsquo;knowledge,&rsquo; that Locke refused to characterize our
information concerning material bodies as
knowledge&rdquo; (Mandelbaum 1964, p. 53).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>  A good discussion of
this point may be found in Jolley 1999, Ch. 4 (&ldquo;The Philosophy
of Matter&rdquo;).  It should be noted that people might disagree at
different times or places about which set of qualities identifies any
given kind; that is to say, the nominal essence, by which we classify
particular things as belonging to a natural kind, might vary across
times and communities.  There is thus a distinction to drawn between
that set of intrinsic qualities from which any given nominal essence
flows, and that set of intrinsic qualities responsible for all of the
thing&rsquo;s qualities.  Lisa Downing (2007, Section 6) suggests, in
concurrence with Paul Guyer, that we avoid confusion by
&lsquo;regimenting&rsquo; Locke&rsquo;s terminology, using the term
&lsquo;real essence&rsquo; to refer to the former, and &lsquo;real
constitution&rsquo; to refer to the latter.  Although I have not
adopted it, this is certainly a worthy suggestion. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>  The term
&lsquo;tertiary qualities&rsquo; has arisen in the secondary
literature to refer to the qualities that Locke describes as
follows:</p>

<p>

&ldquo;To these might be added a third sort which are allowed to be
barely Powers though they are as much real Qualities in the Subject,
as those which I to comply with the common way of speaking call
<em>Qualities</em>, but for distinction <em>secondary
Qualities</em>. For the power in Fire to produce a new Colour, or
consistency in Wax or Clay by its primary Qualities, is as much a
quality in Fire, as the power it has to produce in me a new
<em>Idea</em> or Sensation of warmth or burning, which I felt not
before, by the same primary Qualities, <em>viz</em>. The Bulk,
Texture, and Motion of its insensible parts&rdquo; (E II.viii.10, p.
135).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>  The example is not
Locke&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>  See Jolley, 2002,
pp. 68&ndash;69.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>  Wilson has argued
that &ldquo;Locke&rsquo;s views about the relation of thought and
matter turn out ultimately to undercut the central claim that a
body&rsquo;s sensible qualities flow from the primary qualities of
insensible particles&mdash;and with it the notion that secondary
qualities are explainable in terms of primary ones&rdquo; (Wilson,
1999, p. 198).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>  Hill (2004, p. 627,
628) argues that the concept of superaddition &ldquo;is quite out of
place&rdquo; in connection with cohesion, because Locke regards
cohesion as a foundational problem, which thwarts our efforts to
conceive of body. Yet in the passage just quoted (E IV.iii.29, pp.
559&ndash;560), Locke does appear to attribute cohesion to God in the same
way that he attributes sensation and impulse.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>  &ldquo;Body as far as
we can conceive being able only to strike and affect Body: and Motion,
according to the utmost reach of our <em>Ideas</em>, being able to
produce nothing but Motion, so that when we allow it to produce
pleasure or pain, or the <em>Idea</em> of a Colour, or Sound, we are
fain to quit our Reason, go beyond our <em>Ideas</em>, and attribute
it wholly to the good pleasure of our Maker. For since we must allow
he has annexed Effects to Motion, which we can no way conceive Motion
able to produce, what reason have to we conclude, that he could not
order them as well to be produced in a Subject we cannot conceive
capable of them, as well as in a Subject we cannot conceive the motion
of Matter can any way operate upon? I say not this, that would any way
lessen the belief of the Soul&rsquo;s Immateriality: I am not here
speaking of Probability, but Knowledge&rdquo; (E IV.iii.6, p.
540&ndash;541).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a>  On this point, see
Mandelbaum, 1964, p. 22. See also Downing, 1998, p.  391.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>  See Stein, 1990,
p. 32.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>
&ldquo;The <em>primary</em> Ideas <em>we have peculiar to Body</em>, as
contradistinguished to Spirit, <em>are the cohesion of solid</em>, and
consequently separable <em>parts, and a power of communicating Motion
by impulse</em>. These, I think, are the original <em>Ideas</em>
proper and peculiar to Body: for Figure is but the consequence of
infinite Extension&rdquo; (E II.xxiii.17, p. 306).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>  ULC, Add. MS 1965,
translated and discussed by Koyre, 1965, pp. 271&ndash;272, quoted in and
discussed by Rogers, p. 223; see also Rogers p. 236.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a> See Mandelbaum, 1964,
chapter 2; McGuire, &ldquo;Atoms and the Analogy of Nature&rdquo;,
pp. 77&ndash;89. The problem was originally termed &lsquo;transdiction&rsquo;,
as identified by Donald Williams and discussed by Mandelbaum, 1964,
chapter 2.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a> <em>Principia</em>,
 Book 3, p. 795.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a>  See E IV.iii.6,
p. 542: &ldquo;Who, either on the one side, indulging too much to
their Thoughts immersed altogether in Matter, can allow no existence
to what is not material: Or, who on the other side, finding
not <em>Cognition</em> within the natural Powers of Matter, examined
over and over again, by the utmost Intention of Mind, have the
confidence to conclude, that Omnipotency it self, cannot give
Perception and Thought to a Substance, which has the Modification of
Solidity. He that considers how hardly Sensation is, in our Thoughts,
reconcilable to extended Matter; or Existence to any thing that hath
no Extension at all, will confess, that he is very far from certainly
knowing what his Soul is. &lsquo;Tis a Point, which seems to me, to be
put out of the reach of our Knowledge: And he who will give himself
leave to consider freely, and look into the dark and intricate part of
each Hypothesis, will scarce find his Reason able to determine him
fixedly for, or against, the Soul&rsquo;s Materiality. Since on which
side soever he views it, either as an unextended Substance, or as a
thinking extended Matter; the difficulty to conceive either, will,
whilst either alone is in his Thoughts, still drive him to the
contrary side.&rdquo;</p>

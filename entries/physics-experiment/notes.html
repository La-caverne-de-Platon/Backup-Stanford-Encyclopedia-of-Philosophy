<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Experiment in Physics</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
As the late Richard
Feynman, one of the leading theoretical physicists of the twentieth
century, wrote:</p>

<blockquote>The principle of science, the definition, almost, is the
following: <em>The test of all knowledge is experiment</em>. Experiment
is the <em>sole judge</em> of scientific &lsquo;truth&rsquo;.
<br />
 (Feynman, Leighton and Sands 1963, p. 1-1)</blockquote>

<p>

In these postmodern times this might seem to be an old-fashioned
view, but it is, I believe, correct. Not everyone would agree. As Andy
Pickering has remarked,</p>

<blockquote>&hellip;there is no obligation upon anyone framing a view of the
world to take account of what twentieth-century science has to say.
<br />
 (Pickering 1984a, p. 413)</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 By valid, I mean that
the experimental result has been argued for in the correct way, by use
of epistemological strategies such as those discussed below.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>  See Franklin (1986, Ch. 6;
and, 1990, Ch. 6) and Franklin and Howson (1984) for details of these
strategies, along with a discussion of how they fit into a Bayesian
philosophy of science</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

 As Holmes remarked to
Watson, &ldquo;How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the
impossible, whatever remains, <em>however improbable</em>, must be the
truth.&rdquo; (Conan Doyle 1967, p. 638)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 It might be useful
here to distinguish between the theory of the apparatus and the theory
of the phenomenon. Ackermann is talking primarily about the later. It
may not always be possible to separate these two theories. The analysis
of the data obtained from an instrument may very well involve the
theory of the phenomenon, but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily cast doubt on
the validity of the experimental result.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 For another episode in
which the elimination of background was crucial see the discussion of
the measurement of the \(\ce{K+_{e 2}}\) branching ratio in
(Franklin 1990, pp. 115&ndash;31).</p>

 Collins offers two
arguments concerning the difficulty, if not the virtual impossibility
of replication. The first is philosophical. What does it mean to
replicate an experiment? In what way is the replication similar to the
original experiment? A rough and ready answer is that the replication
measures the same physical quantity. Whether or not it, in fact, does
so can, I believe, be argued for on reasonable grounds, as discussed
earlier.</p>

<p>

Collins&rsquo; second argument is pragmatic. This is the fact that in
practice it is often difficult to get an experimental apparatus, even
one known to be similar to another, to work properly. Collins
illustrates this with his account of Harrison&rsquo;s attempts to construct
two versions of a TEA laser (Transverse Excited Atmospheric) (Collins
1985, pp. 51&ndash;78). Despite the fact that Harrison had previous
experience with such lasers, and had excellent contacts with experts in
the field, he had great difficulty in building the lasers. Hence the
difficulty of replication.</p>

<p>

Ultimately Harrison found errors in his apparatus and once these
were corrected the lasers operated properly. As Collins admits, &ldquo;&hellip;in
the case of the TEA laser the circle was readily broken. The ability of
the laser to vaporize concrete, or whatever, comprised a universally
agreed criterion of experimental quality. There was never any doubt
that the laser ought to be able to work and never any doubt about when
one was working and when it was not.&rdquo; (Collins 1985, p. 84)</p>

<p>

Although Collins seems to regard Harrison&rsquo;s problems with
replication as casting light on the episode of gravity waves, as
support for the experimenters&rsquo; regress, and as casting doubt on
experimental evidence in general, it really doesn&rsquo;t work. As Collins
admits (see quote in last paragraph), the replication was clearly
demonstrable. One may wonder what role Collins thinks this episode
plays in his argument.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 In more detailed
discussions of this episode, Franklin (1994, 1997a), I argued that the
gravity wave experiment is not at all typical of physics experiments.
In most experiments, as illustrated in those essays, the adequacy of
the surrogate signal used in the calibration of the experimental
apparatus is clear and unproblematical. In cases where it is
questionable considerable effort is devoted to establishing the
adequacy of that surrogate signal. Although Collins has chosen an
atypical example I believe that the questions he raises about
calibration in general and about this particular episode of gravity
wave experiments should be answered.</p>
</div>

 Weber had suggested
that the actual gravity wave pulses were longer that expected, and that
the nonlinear analysis algorithm was more efficient at detecting such
pulses.</p>

 The \(\ce{K1^0}\) and \(\ce{K2^0}\) mesons were
elementary particles with the same charge, mass, and intrinsic spin.
They did, however, differ with respect to the \(CP\) operator. The
\(\ce{K1^0}\) and \(\ce{K2^0}\) mesons were
eigenstates of the \(CP\) operator with eigenvalues \(CP = +1\) and \(-1\),
respectively.</p>

 Bose&rsquo;s paper had
originally been rejected by the <em>Philosophical Magazine</em>. He
then sent it, in English, to Einstein with a request that if Einstein
thought the paper merited publication that he would arrange for
publication in the <em>Zeitschrift fur Physik</em>. Einstein personally
translated the paper and submitted it to the <em>Zeitschrift fur
Physik</em>, adding a translator&rsquo;s note, &ldquo;In my opinion, Bose&rsquo;s
derivation of the Planck formula constitutes an important advance. The
method used here also yields the quantum theory of the ideal gas, as I
shall discuss elsewhere in more detail&rdquo; (Pais 1982, p. 423). This
discussion appeared in Einstein&rsquo;s own papers of 1924 and 1925. For
details see Pais (1982, Ch. 23).</p>

 I surveyed eighty such theoretical
papers. Sixty accepted the Princeton result as evidence for either CP
violation or apparent CP violation. Even those that offered alternative
explanations of the result were not necessarily indications that the
authors did not accept CP violation. One should distinguish between
interesting speculations and serious suggestions. The latter are
characterized by a commitment to their truth. I note that T.D. Lee was
author, or co-author, of three of these theoretical papers. Two offered
alternative explanations of the Princeton result and one proposed a
model that <em>avoided</em> CP violation. Lee was not seriously
committed to the truth of any of them. Bell and Perring, authors of one
of the alternatives, remarked, &ldquo;Before a more mundane explanation is
found <em>it is amusing to speculate</em> that it might be a local
effect due to the dysymmetry of the environment, namely the local
preponderance of matter over antimatter&rdquo; (Bell and Perring 1964, p. 348,
emphasis added). </p>

 In the modus tollens if \(h\)
entails \(e\) then &ldquo;not \(e\)&rdquo; entails not \(h\). Duhem
and Quine pointed out that it is really \(h\) and \(b\),
where \(b\) is background knowledge and auxiliary hypotheses, that
entails \(e\). Thus &ldquo;not \(e\)&rdquo; entails &ldquo;\(h\)&rdquo;
or &ldquo;\(b\)&rdquo; and one doesn&rsquo;t know where to place the blame.</p>

<h3>Notes to Appendix 3</h3>

 One difficulty with using rubidium
is that at very low temperatures rubidium should be a solid. (In fact,
rubidium is a solid at room temperature). Wieman, Cornell and their
collaborators avoided this difficulty by creating a system that does
not reach a true equilibrium. The vapor sample created equilibrates to
a thermal distribution as a spin polarized gas, but takes a very long
time to reach its true equilibrium state as a solid. At the low
temperatures and density of the experiment the rubidium remains as a
metastable super-saturated vapor for a long time.</p>

<h3>Notes to Appendix 4</h3>

<p>
 <a name="A4-1" href="app4.html#note-A4-1">1.</a>
 The original E&ouml;tv&ouml;s
experiment was designed to measure the ratio of the gravitational mass
to the inertial mass of different substances. E&ouml;tv&ouml;s found
the ratio to be one, to within approximately one part in a million.
Fischbach and his collaborators reanalyzed E&ouml;tv&ouml;s&rsquo; data and
found a composition dependent effect, which they interpreted as
evidence for a Fifth Force. </p>

<p>

 <a name="A4-2" href="app4.html#note-A4-2">2.</a>
 It is a fact of experimental life
that experiments rarely work when they are initially turned on and that
experimental results can be wrong, even if there is no apparent error.
It is not necessary to know the exact source of an error in order to
discount or to distrust a particular experimental result. Its
disagreement with numerous other results can, I believe, be
sufficient.</p>

<h3>Notes to Appendix 6</h3>

<p>
 <a name="A6-1" href="app6.html#note-A6-1">1.</a>
 Rupp&rsquo;s withdrawal included a note from
a psychiatrist stating that Rupp had suffered from a mental illness and
could not distinguish between fantasy and reality. </p>

<p>

 <a name="A6-2" href="app6.html#note-A6-2">2.</a>
 The problem with the hydrogen
spectrum was not solved until the later discovery of the anomalous
magnetic moment of the electron in the 1950s.</p>

<h3>Notes to Appendix 7</h3>

<p>
 <a name="A7-1" href="app7.html#note-A7-1">1.</a>
 Morrison (1990) has argued that
manipulability is not sufficient to establish belief in an entity. She
discusses particle physics experiments in which particle beams were
viewed not only as particles, but also as beams of quarks, the
constituents of the particles, even though the physicists involved had
no belief in the existence of quarks. Although I believe that
Morrison&rsquo;s argument is correct in this particular case, I do think that
manipulability can, and often does, give us good reason to believe in
an entity. See, for example, the discussion of the microscope in
Hacking (1983). </p>

<p>

 <a name="A7-2" href="app7.html#note-A7-2">2.</a>
 Millikan, for example, used the
properties of electrons emitted in the photoelectric effect to measure
<em>h</em>, Planck&rsquo;s constant. Stern and Gerlach, as discussed below,
used the properties of the electron to investigate spatial
quantization, and also discovered evidence for electron spin.</p>

<p>

 <a name="A7-3" href="app7.html#note-A7-3">3.</a>
 In Cartwright&rsquo;s discussion of the
electron track in the cloud chamber, for example, she can identify the
track as an electron track rather than as a proton track only because
she has made an implicit commitment to the law of ionization for
charged particles, and it&rsquo;s dependence on the mass and velocity of the
particles.</p>

<p>

 <a name="A7-4" href="app7.html#note-A7-4">4.</a>
 Thomson also demonstrated the
magnetic deflection of cathode rays in a separate experiment.</p>

<p>

 <a name="A7-5" href="app7.html#note-A7-5">5.</a>
 Thomson actually investigated the
conductivity of the gas in the tube under varying pressure conditions.
See Thomson (1897, pp. 298&ndash;300).</p>

<p>

 <a name="A7-6" href="app7.html#note-A7-6">6.</a>
 I shall return to this when I
discuss Thomson&rsquo;s measurement of <em>e/m</em> for the electron.</p>

<p>

 <a name="A7-7" href="app7.html#note-A7-7">7.</a>
 Thomson&rsquo;s argument is the &ldquo;duck
argument.&rdquo; If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and waddles
like a duck, then we have good reason to believe that it is a duck. One
need only reconstitute the argument using &ldquo;it&rdquo; as cathode rays and
negatively charged particles as ducks.</p>

<p>

 <a name="A7-8" href="app7.html#note-A7-8">8.</a>
 Thomson actually used two different
methods to determine the charge to mass ratio. The other method used
the total charge carried by a beam of cathode rays in a fixed period of
time, the total energy carried by the beam in that same time, and the
radius of curvature of the particles in a known magnetic field. Thomson
regarded the method discussed in the text as more reliable and this is
the method shown in most modern physics textbooks.</p>

<p>

 <a name="A7-9" href="app7.html#note-A7-9">9.</a>
 Not everything Thomson concluded
is in agreement with modern views. Although he believed that the
electron was a constituent of atoms, he thought that it was the
primordial atom from which all atoms were constructed, similar to
Prout&rsquo;s view that all atoms were constructed from hydrogen atoms. He
also suggested that the charge on the electron might be larger than
that of the hydrogen ion.</p>

<h3>Notes to Appendix 8</h3>

<p>
 <a name="A8-1" href="app8.html#note-A8-1">1.</a>
 The conservation of momentum also
requires that the electron and proton have equal and opposite momenta,
for a neutron decay at rest. They will be emitted in opposite
directions. </p>

<p>

 <a name="A8-2" href="app8.html#note-A8-2">2.</a>
 Pauli&rsquo;s suggestion was first made in
a December 4, 1930 letter to the radioactive group at a regional
meeting in Tuebingen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Radioactive Ladies and Gentlemen: </p>

<p>

I beg you to receive graciously the bearer of this letter who will
report to you in detail how I have hit on a desperate was to escape
from the problems of the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; statistics of the N and
Li<sup>6</sup> nuclei and of the continuous beta spectrum in order to
save the &ldquo;even-odd&rdquo; rule of statistics and the law of
conservation of energy. Namely the possibility that electrically
neutral particles, which I would like to call neutrons [the particle
we call the neutron, which is about the same mass as the proton, was
discovered in 1932 by Chadwick. Pauli&rsquo;s &ldquo;neutron&rdquo; is
our &ldquo;neutrino.&rdquo;] might exist inside nuclei; these would
have spin 1/2, would obey the exclusion principle, and would in
addition duffer from photons through the fact that they would not
travel at the speed of light. The mass of the neutron ought to be
about the same order of magnitude as the electron mass, and in any
case could not be greater than 0.01 proton masses. The continuous beta
spectrum would then become understandable by assuming that in beta
decay a neutron is always emitted along with the electron, in such a
way that the sum of the energies of the neutron and electron is a
constant.</p>

<p>

Now, the question is, what forces act on the neutron? The most
likely model for the neutron seems to me, on wave mechanical grounds,
to be the assumption that the motionless neutron is a magnetic dipole
with a certain magnetic moment \(\mu\) (the bearer of this letter can
supply details). The experiments demand that the ionizing power of such
a neutron cannot exceed that of a gamma ray, and therefore \(\mu\)
probably cannot be greater than \(e \cdot (10^{-13}\text{cm})\).
[\(e\) is the charge of the electron].</p>

<p>

At the moment I do not dare to publish anything about this idea, so
I first turn trustingly to you, dear radioactive friends, with the
question: how could such a neutron be experimentally identified if it
possessed about the same penetrating power as a gamma ray or perhaps 10
times greater penetrating power?</p>

<p>

I admit that my way out may look rather improbable at first since if
the neutron existed it would have been seen long ago. But nothing
ventured, nothing gained. The gravity of the situation with the
continuous beta spectrum was illuminated by a remark by my
distinguished predecessor in office, Mr. DeBye, who recently said to me
in Brussels, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a problem like the new taxes; one had best not
think about it at all.&rdquo; So one ought to discuss seriously any way that
may lead to salvation. Well, dear radioactive friends, weigh it and
pass sentence! Unfortunately, I cannot appear personally in Tubingen,
for I cannot get away from Zurich on account of a ball which is held
here on the night of December 6&ndash;7. With best regards to you and to Mr.
Baek,</p>

<p>

Your most obedient servant,
<br />

This was a serious suggestion and although Pauli did not get all the
properties of the neutrino right his suggestion was the basis of
further work.</p>

 With a three-body decay the electron
and the proton also didn&rsquo;t have to come off back to back. This
observation was not made until the late 1930s. Assigning the neutrino a
spin, intrinsic angular momentum, of \(h/4\) also preserved the law of
conservation of angular momentum.</p>

<p>

 <a name="A8-4" href="app8.html#note-A8-4">4.</a>
 The actual history is more complex.
For a time, an alternative theory of decay, proposed by Konopinski and
Uhlenbeck (1935) was better supported by the experimental evidence than
was Fermi&rsquo;s theory. It was subsequently shown that both the
experimental results and the theoretical calculations were wrong and
that Fermi&rsquo;s theory was, in fact, supported by the evidence. For
details see (Franklin 1990).</p>

 Allowed transitions are those for
which both the electron and neutrino wavefunctions could be considered
constant over nuclear dimensions. Forbidden transitions are those that
included higher order terms in the perturbation series expansion of the
matrix element.</p>

 I have been unable to find a
published reference to this measurement. It is cited as a private
communication in the literature.</p>

<p>

 <a name="A8-7" href="app8.html#note-A8-7">7.</a>
 In a post-deadline paper presented
at the January 1958 meeting of the American Physical Society, Rustad
and Ruby suggested that their earlier result might be wrong. There are
no abstracts of post-deadline papers, but the talk was cited in the
literature. Ruby remembers the tone of the paper as <em>mea culpa</em>
(private communication).</p>

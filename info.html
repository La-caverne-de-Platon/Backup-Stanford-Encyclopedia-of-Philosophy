<h2><a id="policies"></a>Editorial Policies</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Editorial decisions concerning the <em>Encyclopedia</em>,
including decisions concerning its content, format and distribution,
are made by the Principal Editor in consultation with the Senior
Editor, Associate Editor, and the members of the Editorial Board.</li>
  <li>The members of the Editorial Board are selected in consultation
with the Stanford University Department of Philosophy, which serves as
the <em>Encyclopedia</em>'s Advisory Board.  The Advisory Board also
advises the Principal Editor on the basic policies governing the
operation of the <em>Encyclopedia</em>.</li>
  <li>Contributions to the <em>Encyclopedia</em> are normally
solicited by invitation from a member of the Editorial Board.
However, <em>qualified</em> potential contributors may send, to 
<a href="m&#97;ilto:editors&#37;40plato&#37;2estanford&#37;2eedu"><em>editors<abbr title="
at
">&#64;</abbr>plato<abbr title="dot">&#46;</abbr>stanford<abbr title="dot">&#46;</abbr>edu</em></a>,
an <em>enquiry</em> concerning the possibility of submitting a
preliminary proposal to write on an <em>Encyclopedia topic</em>. The
editors will then reply with a message that explains the conditions
that must be met for us to consider a one-page
&lsquo;pre-proposal&rsquo;.
  <ul>
  <li>By <em>qualified</em>, we mean those persons with accredited
Ph.D.s in Philosophy (or a related discipline) who have published
<em>refereed works</em> on the topic of the proposed entry.  By
<em>refereed works</em> we mean either articles in respected,
peer-reviewed journals or books which have been published by respected
publishing houses and which have undergone the usual peer review
process prior to publication. (Notes in newsletters, proceedings,
unpublished dissertations, etc., do not count as much.)  However, if a
member of our Editorial Board is familiar with the work of the
potential contributor, the latter may be certified as qualified.</li>
  <li>By <em>Encyclopedia topic</em>, we mean a topic that is
appropriate for a reference work in academic philosophy and is (a)
either listed in our Projected Table of Contents or (b) falls within
the area of expertise of one of the members of our Editorial Board.
Since the <em>Encyclopedia</em> currently does not yet have subject
editors for every specialized area of philosophy, some topics suitable
for a reference work in academic philosophy might fail condition (b)
-- we reserve the right to determine whether such preliminary entry
proposals (in specialized areas for which the Encyclopedia lacks
subject editors) should be pursued at this time.</li>
  </ul>
 The members of the Editorial Board reserve the right to compare the
qualifications of any person submitting an unsolicited request with
those of other potential authors who would be qualified to write
the entry in question.</li>
  <li>All entries, whether solicited or approved, will be refereed by
one or more of the subject editors on our Editorial Board or by one
or more external referees who have been approved by a member of the
Editorial Board.  Authors are expected to engage any constructive
criticisms they receive during the referee process, prior to
publication.  Authors should note, however, that no matter whether
they have been invited or approved by one of these subject editors,
our goal of producing a high-quality reference work requires us to
admit the possibility that some submitted entries may not be accepted
for publication.</li>
  <li>Readers of the <em>Encyclopedia</em> are encouraged to contact
authors directly with comments, corrections, and other suggestions
for improvements.</li>
  <li>It remains the responsibility of authors to maintain their
entries and to keep them current.  Authors are expected to revise their
entries <em>in a timely way</em> both (1) in response to important new
research on the topic of the entry and (2) in response to any valid
criticism they receive, whether it comes from the subject editors on
our Editorial Board, other members of the profession, or interested
readers.  In connection with (1), authors should update the
Bibliography and Other Internet Resources sections of their entries
regularly, to keep pace with significant new publications, both in
print and on the web.  In connection with (2), the validity of
criticism will be determined by the Principal Editor, typically in
consultation with the relevant members of the Editorial Board.  The
length of time required for a "timely" revision will be negotiable and
will both respect the author's current commitments and reflect how
seriously the piece fails to accomodate new research or the
seriousness of any valid criticism.  Entries which are not revised
within the negotiated timetable may be retired from the active portion
of the <em>Encyclopedia</em> and left in the <em>Encyclopedia</em>
Archives until such time as the entry is revised so as to engage the
valid criticisms in question.</li>
  <li>The views expressed by the authors in their entries are their
own and do not necessarily reflect those of Stanford University, the
Stanford University Philosophy Department, the <em>Encyclopedia</em>'s
Editors or of anyone else associated with the <em>Encyclopedia</em>.</li>

<h2><a id="pub-ethics">Publication Ethics</a></h2>

<p>The following is adapted from the
  <a href="http://www.psychopen.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/guidelines/publication_ethics_and_publication_malpractice_statement.pdf" target="other">Code of Conduct and Best-Practice Guidelines for Journal Editors</a>,
 published by the Committee on Publication Ethics, 2011.
</p>


<p>
The SEP Editors endeavor to meet the needs of its intended audience;
constantly improve our reference work; have processes in place to
assure the quality of the material we publish; maintain the integrity
of the academic record; preclude business needs from compromising
intellectual and ethical standards; and publish corrections,
clarifications, etc. as needed in a timely way.  The SEP Editors
further endeavor to: actively welcome the views of authors, readers,
reviewers, and editorial board members about ways of improving their
SEP's processes; encourage and be aware of research into peer review
and publishing and reassessing the SEP's processes in the light of new
findings; support initiatives designed to reduce research and
publication misconduct; support initiatives to educate researchers
about publication ethics; and assess the effects of our policies on
author and reviewer behavior and revising policies, as required, to
encourage responsible behavior and discourage misconduct. Finally, the
SEP Editors will: ensure that all entries are reviewed by suitably
qualified reviewers; adopt processes that encourage accuracy,
completeness and clarity of reporting; adopt authorship or
contributorship systems that promote good practice (i.e. so that
authorship information accurately reflects who did the work) and
discourage misconduct (e.g. ghost and guest authors); and ensure that
conflicts of interest are handled in an appropriate manner.</p>

<a id="takedown"><em>Take Down Policy</em></a>.

discover and contact copyright holders of artwork and content used in
this website.  To the extent that a copyright holder could not be
found or an inadvertent permissions or copyright error was made, the

<h2 id="terms">Terms of Use</h2>

<p><em>Preamble</em>. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) is an
edited open access work produced by a collaborative community of
scholars. SEP entries (i.e., the articles contributed by SEP authors)
are regularly revised&mdash;although fixed version are available from our
Archives. In order to preserve the integrity of the SEP&mdash;to sustain it
as a free resource for the long term and to ensure clarity regarding
what content is current&mdash;some distribution rights are limited.</p>

<ol>
<li><em>User Rights</em>. The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University (&ldquo;Stanford&rdquo;) grants each individual user
(&ldquo;User&rdquo;) a royalty-free non-exclusive limited license to
read, download, make copies, print, search, or link to the full text
of each SEP entry; to crawl each entry for indexing (subject to
reasonable network usage constraints); and to distribute each entry
only as permitted below provided that the purpose of the distribution
is non-commercial.</li>

<li><em>Limited Electronic Distribution Rights</em>.

  <ol type="a">
<li>A User may electronically distribute an SEP entry to computers and
mobile devices that are owned and controlled by the User.</li>

<li>A User may electronically distribute an SEP entry to others only
for private electronic correspondence. This includes communications
between the User and an individual, and communications, postings or
file-sharing to closed, invitation-only groups of individuals with no
archives publicly available, provided that the group consists of no
greater than 30 individuals.</li>

<li>A User may electronically distribute a link to an SEP
entry.</li>

<li>No other electronic distribution rights are granted.</li>
  </ol>
</li>

<li><em>Limited Fixed-Media Distribution Rights</em>. Users may distribute
printed copies or copies on fixed media (e.g., CD-ROM) only with prior
written permission of the author of the SEP entry.</li>

<li><em>Course Reader Policy</em>. Since students should have free
access to all entries at the SEP 
website <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/">https://plato.stanford.edu/</a>,
we encourage instructors to distribute a link to the relevant content on our
site to their students instead of distributing copies of SEP entries in course
readers.&nbsp; Students (a) may prefer to
read SEP entries on their electronic devices without incurring any costs, and
(b) may be able to print SEP entries for themselves more cheaply than the
amount charged for reproducing those pages in a course reader. Despite this
recommendation, the inclusion of SEP entries in course readers is allowed under
the following conditions:

  <ol type="a">
<li>If the course reader containing an SEP entry is to be distributed
in fixed-media (e.g., print), permission of the author must be
secured.</li>

<li>If a course reader containing an SEP entry is to be distributed
electronically, it must be done in compliance with 2(b).</li>
  </ol>
</li>

<li><em>General</em>. The SEP, Stanford, its trustees, officers,
faculty, staff and students (including affiliates) are not liable for
indirect consequential, incidental, special, punitive, exemplary
damages, including lost profits. Failure to enforce these terms of use
does not constitute a waiver. Entries are provided &ldquo;as-is&rdquo;
and Stanford disclaims all warranties with respect to the SEP website
and SEP entries, including express warranties, and implied warranties
of merchantibility, fitness for purpose, title and
non-infringement. No warranty is provided that the website or SEP
entries or access to them, are secure, uninterrupted, timely,
accurate, error-free or virus-free. These terms of use and any dispute
that may arise out of them, SEP entries or the website may only be
brought in State or Federal court located in Santa Clara County,
California, United States.</li>

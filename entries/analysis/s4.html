<h3><a name="1">1. Introduction to Supplement</a></h3>

<p>

This supplement sketches how a reductive form of analysis emerged in 
Descartes&rsquo;s development of analytic geometry, and elaborates on
the way in which decompositional conceptions of analysis came to the 
fore in the early modern period, as outlined in 
 <a href="index-2.html#4">&sect;4</a>
 of the main document.</p>

<h3><a name="2">2. Descartes and Analytic Geometry</a></h3>

<p>

In a famous passage in his replies to Mersenne&rsquo;s objections to 
the <em>Meditations</em>, in discussing the distinction between 
analysis and synthesis, Descartes remarks that &ldquo;it is analysis 
which is the best and truest method of instruction, and it was this 
method alone which I employed in my <em>Meditations</em>&rdquo; 
(<em>PW</em>, II, 111 
 [<a href="s1.html#Descartes">Full Quotation</a>]).
 According to Descartes, it is analysis rather than synthesis that is 
of the greater value, since it shows &ldquo;how the thing in question
was discovered&rdquo;, and he accuses the ancient geometers of 
keeping the techniques of analysis to themselves &ldquo;like a sacred
mystery&rdquo; (<em>ibid</em>.; cf. <em>PW</em>, I, 17 
 [<a href="s1.html#Descartes">Quotation</a>]).
 Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em> is indeed set out in 
&lsquo;synthetic&rsquo; form, but it is unfair to suggest that 
someone who worked through the text would not gain practice in 
analysis, although admittedly there are no rules of analysis 
explicitly articulated.</p>

<p>

However, it was Descartes&rsquo;s own development of 
&lsquo;analytic&rsquo; geometry&mdash;as opposed to what, 
correspondingly, then became known as the &lsquo;synthetic&rsquo; 
geometry of Euclid&mdash;that made him aware of the importance of 
analysis, and which opened up a whole new dimension to analytic 
methodology. Significantly, Descartes&rsquo;s <em>Geometry</em> was 
first published together with the <em>Discourse</em> and advertised 
as an essay in the method laid out in the <em>Discourse</em>. The 
<em>Geometry</em> opens boldly: &ldquo;Any problem in geometry can 
easily be reduced to such terms that a knowledge of the lengths of 
certain straight lines is sufficient for its construction.&rdquo; 
(<em>G</em>, 2.) Descartes goes on to show how the arithmetical 
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and the
extraction of roots can be represented geometrically. For example, 
multiplication of two lines <em>BD</em> and <em>BC</em> can be 
carried out by joining them as in the diagram below by <em>AC</em>, 
with <em>AB</em> taken as the unit length. If <em>DE</em> is then 
drawn parallel to <em>AC</em>, <em>BE</em> is the required result. 
(Since the ratio of <em><em>BD</em></em> to BE is the same as the 
ratio of <em>AB</em> to <em>BC</em>, the two triangles <em>BDE</em> 
and <em>BAC</em> being similar, <em>BD</em> &times; <em>BC</em> = 
<em>AB</em> &times; <em>BE</em> = <em>BE</em>, if <em>AB</em> is the 
unit length.)</p>

<blockquote><img src="Diagdesc.jpg" alt="diagram" /></blockquote>

<p>

Problems can indeed then be broken down into simpler problems 
involving the construction of individual straight lines, encouraging 
the decompositional conception of analysis. But what is of greatest 
importance in Descartes&rsquo;s <em>Geometry</em> is the use made of 
algebra. Although the invention of algebra too can be traced back to 
the ancient Greeks, most notably, Diophantus, who had introduced 
numerical variables (&lsquo;<em>x</em>&rsquo;, 
&lsquo;<em>x</em>&sup2;&rsquo;, etc.), it was only in the 16th 
century that algebra finally established itself. Vieta, in a work of 
1591, added schematic letters to numerical variables, so that 
quadratic equations, for example, could then be represented (in the 
form &lsquo;<em>ax</em>&sup2; + <em>bx</em> + <em>c</em> = 0&rsquo;),
yielding results of greater generality. Algebra was specifically 
called an &lsquo;art of analysis&rsquo;, and it was in the work of 
Descartes (as well as Fermat) that its enormous potential was 
realised. It did indeed prove a powerful tool of analysis, enabling 
complex geometrical figures to be represented algebraically, allowing
the resources of algebra and arithmetic to be employed in solving the
transformed geometrical problems.</p>

<p>

The philosophical significance was no less momentous. For in reducing
geometrical problems to arithmetical and algebraic problems, the need
to appeal to geometrical &lsquo;intuition&rsquo; was removed. Indeed,
as Descartes himself makes clear in &lsquo;Rule Sixteen&rsquo;, 
representing everything algebraically&mdash;abstracting from specific
numerical magnitudes as well as from geometrical figures&mdash;allows
us to appreciate just what is essential (<em>PW</em>, I, 66-9.) The 
aim is not just to solve a problem, or to come out with the right 
answer, but to gain an insight into <em>how</em> the problem is 
solved, or <em>why</em> it is the right answer. What algebraic 
representation reveals is the structure of the solution in its 
appropriate generality. (Cf. Gaukroger 1989, ch. 3.) Of course, 
&lsquo;intuition&rsquo; is still required, according to Descartes, to
attain the &lsquo;clear and distinct&rsquo; ideas of the fundamental 
truths and relations that lie at the base of what we are doing, but 
this was not seen as something that we could just appeal to without 
rigorous training in the whole Cartesian method.</p>

<p>

The further application of algebraic techniques, in the context of 
the development of function theory, was to lead to the creation by 
Leibniz and Newton of the differential and integral 
calculus&mdash;which, in mathematics, came to be called 
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo;. In turn, it was the project of rigorizing the
calculus in the nineteenth century that played a key role in the work
of Frege and Russell, in which function theory was extended to logic 
itself and &lsquo;analytic&rsquo; philosophy was founded (see 
 <a href="index-2.html#6">&sect;6</a>
 of the main document).</p>

<h3><a name="3">3. British Empiricism</a></h3>

<p>

The decompositional conception of analysis, as applied to ideas or 
concepts, was particularly characteristic of British empiricism. As 
Locke put it, &ldquo;all our complex Ideas are ultimately resolvable 
into simple Ideas, of which they are compounded, and originally made 
up, though perhaps their immediate Ingredients, as I may so say, are 
also complex Ideas&rdquo; (<em>Essay</em>, II, xxii, 9 
 [<a href="s1.html#Locke">Full Quotation</a>]).
 The aim was then to provide an account of these ideas, explaining how
they arise, showing what simpler ideas make up our complex ideas 
(e.g., of substance) and distinguishing the various mental operations
performed on them in generating what knowledge and beliefs we have. 
Locke only uses the term &lsquo;Analysis&rsquo;, however, once in the
entire <em>Essay</em> (shortly after the remark just quoted). Perhaps
he was conscious of its meaning in ancient Greek geometry, making him
hesitant to use it more widely, but it is still significant that when
he does, he does so in precisely the sense of 
&lsquo;decomposition&rsquo; 
 [<a href="s1.html#LockeA">Quotation</a>].
 Locke tends to talk, though, of &lsquo;combining&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;composing&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;synthesizing&rsquo; 
complex ideas from simpler ideas, and of &lsquo;separating&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;resolving&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;analyzing&rsquo; them into
simpler ideas. But in the period following Locke, 
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo; came to be used more and more for the process 
of &lsquo;resolving&rsquo; complexes into their constituents.</p>

<p>


 <a href="bib4.html#4.3">Annotated Bibliography, &sect;4.3</a>
 </p>

<h3><a name="4">4. Leibniz</a></h3>

<p>

Leibniz occupies a pivotal point in the history of conceptions of 
analysis. Well versed in both classical and modern thought, at the 
forefront of both mathematics and philosophy, he provided a grand 
synthesis of existing conceptions of analysis and at the same time 
paved the way for the dominance of the decompositional conception. 
The key to all of this is what can be called his <em>containment 
principle</em>. In a letter to Arnauld, he writes: &ldquo;in every 
affirmative true proposition, necessary or contingent, universal or 
singular, the notion of the predicate is contained in some way in 
that of the subject, <em>praedicatum inest subjecto</em>. Or else I 
do not know what truth is.&rdquo; (<em>PW</em>, 62; cf. <em>PT</em>, 
87-8 
 [<a href="s1.html#LeibnizPT">Quotation</a>].)
 If this containment of the predicate in the subject could then be 
made explicit, according to Leibniz, a proof of the proposition could
thereby be achieved. Proof thus proceeds by <em>analyzing</em> the 
subject, the aim being to reduce the proposition to what Leibniz 
calls an &lsquo;identity&rsquo;&mdash;by successive applications of 
the rule of &lsquo;substitution of equivalents&rsquo;, utilizing an 
appropriate definition. A proposition expresses an identity, in 
Leibniz&rsquo;s terminology, if the predicate is explicitly either 
identical with or included in the subject (cf. <em>PT</em>, 87-8 
 [<a href="s1.html#LeibnizPT">Quotation</a>]).
 The following proof of &lsquo;4 = 2 + 2&rsquo; illustrates the 
procedure (cf. Leibniz <em>NE</em>, IV, vii, 10):</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td>(a)</td>
<td>4 = 2 + 2</td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>(b)</td>
<td>3 + 1 = 2 + 2</td>
<td>(by the definition &lsquo;4 = 3 + 1&rsquo;)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>(c)</td>
<td>(2 + 1) + 1 = 2 + 2</td>
<td>(by the definition &lsquo;3 = 2 + 1&rsquo;)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>(d)</td>
<td>2 + (1 + 1) = 2 + 2</td>
<td>(by associativity)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>(e)</td>
<td>2 + 2 = 2 + 2</td>
<td>(by the definition &lsquo;2 = 1 + 1&rsquo;)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

The final line of the proof is an &lsquo;identity&rsquo; in 
Leibniz&rsquo;s sense, and the important point about an identity is 
that it is &lsquo;self-evident&rsquo; or &lsquo;known through 
itself&rsquo;, i.e., can be simply &lsquo;seen&rsquo; to be true (cf.
Leibniz <em>PW</em>, 15; <em>LP</em>, 62). It would be tempting to 
talk here of identities being &lsquo;intuited&rsquo; as true, but 
Leibniz tends to use the word &lsquo;intuition&rsquo; for the 
immediate grasp of the <em>content</em> of a concept (cf. 
<em>MKTI</em>, 23-7), whereas the point about knowing the truth of 
identities is that we can do so without grasping the content of any 
of the terms. To the extent that we can still judge that such a 
proposition is true, our knowledge is what Leibniz calls 
&lsquo;blind&rsquo; or &lsquo;symbolic&rsquo; rather than 
&lsquo;intuitive&rsquo; (<em>ibid</em>., 25).</p>

<p>

Indeed, it was precisely because proofs could be carried out without 
appeal to intuition that Leibniz was so attracted to the symbolic 
method. As he remarked in the <em>New Essays</em>, the great value of
algebra, or the generalized algebra that he called the &lsquo;art of 
symbols&rsquo;, lay in the way it &lsquo;unburdens the 
imagination&rsquo; (<em>NE</em>, 488). If proofs could be generated 
purely mechanically, then they were freed from the vagaries of our 
own mental processes (cf. <em>NE</em>, 75, 412). For Leibniz, the 
status of a proposition&mdash;its truth or falsity, necessity or 
contingency&mdash;was dependent not on its mode of apprehension (as 
it was for Descartes and Locke), which could vary from person to 
person, but on its method of proof, which was an objectively 
determinable matter.</p>

<p>

Leibniz&rsquo;s conception of analysis can thus be seen as combining 
aspects of Plato&rsquo;s method of division, in the centrality 
accorded to the definition of concepts, of ancient Greek geometry and
Aristotelian logic, in the emphasis placed on proof and working back 
to first principles, and of Cartesian geometry and the new algebra, 
in the value attributed to symbolic formulations. Furthermore, we can
see how, on Leibniz&rsquo;s view, analysis and synthesis are strictly
complementary (cf. <em>USA</em>, 16-17 
 [<a href="s1.html#LeibnizUSA">Quotation</a>]).
 For since we are concerned only with identities, all steps are 
reversible. As long as the right notation and appropriate definitions
and principles are provided, one can move with equal facility in 
either an &lsquo;analytic&rsquo; or a &lsquo;synthetic&rsquo; 
direction, i.e., in the example above, either from (a) to (e) or from
(e) to (a). If a <em>characteristica universalis</em> or ideal 
logical language could thus be created, we would have a system that 
could function not only as an international language and scientific 
notation but also as a <em>calculus ratiocinator</em> that provided 
both a logic of proof and a logic of discovery. Leibniz&rsquo;s 
vision may have been absurdly ambitious, but the ideal was to 
influence many subsequent philosophers, most notably, Frege and 
Russell.</p>

<h3><a name="5">5. Kant</a></h3>

<p>

The decompositional conception of analysis, as applied to concepts, 
reached its high-point in the work of Kant, although it has continued
to have an influence ever since, most notably, in Russell&rsquo;s and
Moore&rsquo;s early philosophies (see 
 <a href="s6.html#3">&sect;3</a>
 and 
 <a href="s6.html#4">&sect;4</a>
 of the supplementary document on Conceptions of Analysis in Analytic 
Philosophy). As his pre-critical writings show, Kant simply takes 
over the Leibnizian conception of analysis, and even though, in his 
critical period, he comes to reject the Leibnizian view that all 
truths are, in Leibniz&rsquo;s sense, &lsquo;analytic&rsquo;, he 
retains the underlying conception of analysis. He simply recognizes a
further class of &lsquo;synthetic&rsquo; truths, and within this, a 
subclass of &lsquo;synthetic <em>a priori</em>&rsquo; truths, which 
it is the main task of the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> to 
elucidate.</p>

<p>

As the &lsquo;Introduction&rsquo; to the <em>Critique</em> shows 
(A6-7/B10-11), the decompositional conception of analysis lies at the
base of Kant&rsquo;s distinction between analytic and synthetic 
judgements. We can formulate Kant&rsquo;s &lsquo;official&rsquo; 
criterion for analyticity as follows:</p>

<blockquote>(AN<font size="-2">O</font>) A true judgement of the form
&lsquo;<em>A</em> is <em>B</em>&rsquo; is <em>analytic</em> if and only
if the predicate <em>B</em> is contained in the subject
<em>A</em>.</blockquote>

<p>

The problem with this criterion, though, or at least, with the way 
that Kant glosses it, is obvious. For who is the judge of whether a 
predicate is or is not &lsquo;contained&rsquo;&mdash;however 
&lsquo;covertly&rsquo;&mdash;in the subject? According to Leibniz, 
for example, all truths, even contingent ones, are 
&lsquo;analytic&rsquo;: it is just that, in the case of a contingent 
truth, only God can know what is &lsquo;covertly contained&rsquo; in 
the subject, i.e., know its analysis. Kant&rsquo;s talk of the 
connection between subject and predicate in analytic judgements being
&lsquo;thought through identity&rsquo;, however, suggests a more 
objective criterion&mdash;a logical rather than phenomenological one.
This is made more explicit later on in the <em>Critique</em>, when 
Kant specifies the principle of contradiction as &lsquo;the highest 
principle of all analytic judgements&rsquo; (A150-1/B189-91). The 
alternative criterion can be formulated thus:</p>

<blockquote>(AN<font size="-2">L</font>) A true judgement of the form
&lsquo;<em>A</em> is <em>B</em>&rsquo; is <em>analytic</em> if and only
if its negation &lsquo;<em>A</em> is not <em>B</em>&rsquo; is
self-contradictory.</blockquote>

<p>

However, in anything other than trivial cases (such as Leibnizian 
&lsquo;identities&rsquo;), it will still require 
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo; to show that &lsquo;<em>A</em> is not 
<em>B</em>&rsquo; is self-contradictory, and for any given step of 
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo;, it seems that we would still have to rely on 
what is &lsquo;thought&rsquo; in the relevant concept. So it is not 
clear that (AN<font size="-2">L</font>) is an improvement within 
Kant&rsquo;s system.</p>

<p>

Whatever criterion we might offer to capture Kant&rsquo;s notion of 
analyticity, the fundamental point of contrast between 
&lsquo;analytic&rsquo; and &lsquo;synthetic&rsquo; judgements, rooted
in the decompositional conception of analysis, lies in the former 
merely &lsquo;clarifying&rsquo; and the latter 
&lsquo;extending&rsquo; our knowledge. It was for this reason that 
Kant regarded mathematical propositions as synthetic, since he was 
convinced&mdash;rightly&mdash;that mathematics advances our 
knowledge. This is made clear in chapter 1 of the 
&lsquo;Transcendental Doctrine of Method&rsquo; (<em>CPR</em>, 
A716-7/B744-5), where Kant argues that no amount of 
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo; of the concept of a triangle will enable a 
philosopher to show that the sum of the angles of a triangle equals 
two right angles 
 [<a href="s1.html#KantTDM">Quotation</a>].
 It takes a geometer to demonstrate this, by actually constructing the
triangle and drawing appropriate auxiliary lines (as Euclid does in 
I, 32 of the <em>Elements</em>). Kant writes that &ldquo;To 
<em>construct</em> a concept means to exhibit <em>a priori</em> the 
intuition corresponding to it&rdquo; (A713/B741); and such 
&lsquo;intuition&rsquo; is also needed in constructing the auxiliary 
lines. According to Kant, then, the whole process is one of 
<em>synthesis</em>. But the two activities mentioned here are both 
part of what the ancient geometers called <em>analysis</em> (see 
 <a href="s2.html#2">&sect;2</a>
 of the supplementary document on Ancient Conceptions of Analysis). 
What is remarkable about Kant&rsquo;s conception is the way that it 
has inverted the original conception of analysis in ancient Greek 
geometry&mdash;or at least collapsed together into 
&lsquo;synthesis&rsquo; what had previously been distinguished. 
&lsquo;Analysis&rsquo; is left with such a small role to play that it
is not surprising that it is condemned as useless.</p>

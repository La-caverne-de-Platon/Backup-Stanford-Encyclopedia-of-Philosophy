<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Process Philosophy</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Among the main theoretical alternatives for an ontological
interpretation of the temporal existence of things, contemporary
analytical ontology discusses so-called
&ldquo;four-dimensionalism,&rdquo; &ldquo;eternalism,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;stage theory,&rdquo; which, interestingly, are all
<em>static</em> varieties of Leibniz&rsquo; analysis.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 On the first three topics see Fortescue 2001, Brown 2005, and
Herstein 2005, respectively, on the fourth see 
 <a href="#note-19">note 19</a> 
 below. Process philosophy in the letter or spirit of Whitehead has
been the most visible strand of contemporary process philosophy,
carried by a larger group of philosophers (see section 7. on
institutionalization).  Without wanting to diminish the significance
of Whiteheadian process philosophy, either in itself nor for process
philosophy, this entry is written with the aim to convey that process
philosophy is a longstanding and highly diversified enterprise that
should not be too closely associated with any particular school or
movement.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 After Whitehead&rsquo;s <em>Process and Reality</em>, which surely
offers a plethora of observations, arguments, and analyses in support
of all three of these claims, proposals for process ontology or
metaphysics are rarely presented together with an explicit reflection
of the conditions of theory revision in philosophy. More recent
contributions to process-geared philosophy typically are prefaced by
metaphilosophical commentary where some revision targets are
highlighted (see e.g., the introduction to Stout 2018 and Nicholson
and Dupr&eacute; 2018); more detailed descriptions of revision targets
are given in Seibt 1990, where the substance paradigm (&ldquo;myth of
substance&rdquo;) is characterized in terms of over 20 ontological
presuppositions, but the systematic role of these for other
philosophical disciplines beyond ontology is not worked out.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 The history of process philosophy contains various vague pointers to
the link between cognitive habituation and language structure (see
e.g., Whitehead 1929: 49). Nowadays the claim can be properly
supported, however, by drawing on recent research cognitive
linguistics and cognitive science, in particular, on recent studies of
linguistic relativity; moreover, research in linguistic typology,
especially on the semantics of noun-phrases across languages, can be
used to motivate the switch to a process ontology on purely
methodological grounds, see Seibt 2015b.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 The following reconstruction and discussion of Strawson&rsquo;s
argument is based on Rescher 1962 and 1996, ch. 3.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 See for instance Auxier and Herstein (2017), who offer a new approach
to our understanding of explanation in philosophical and cosomological
inquiries by way of presenting a comprehensive and novel
interpretation of Whitehead&rsquo;s philosophical and mathematical
writings. Given the affinities to Whitehead, Manuel DeLanda&rsquo;s
(2012) elaboration of Deleuze&rsquo;s process metaphysics may also be
understood as a transpositional explication in a wider sense.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 To be sure, linguistic theories of verb semantics and aspectuality
not only offer important data for process ontology: while
interpretations of &ldquo;event structures&rdquo; in formal semantics
predominantly have used the traditional &lsquo;static&rsquo;
categories (objects, events conceived of as states or extended
regions) Bridget Copley and Heidi Harley recently presented a
distinctly processual &ldquo;force-theoretic&rdquo; semantics, taking
&ldquo;dynamic predicates&rdquo; to denote forces rather than extended
events (see e.g., Copley and Harley 2015)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 A noteworthy forerunner of these efforts to clarify the logical
features of processes vis-&agrave;-vis other categories can be found
in Zemach 1970. Aristotle&rsquo;s observation that sentences in the
progressive govern different inferences depending on whether they
denote activities (seeing) or developments (building a house),
respectively, figures central in most ontological and linguistic
classifications of occurrence types, from Mourelatos 1978 and Roberts
1979 to the various recent categorizations of Aktionsarten in
linguistic aspectology. By contrast, Stout (1997, 2015) and Steward
(1997, 2013) disregard this inferential difference and take every
sentence with progressive aspect to denote a &ldquo;process&rdquo;,
contrasting these with &ldquo;events&rdquo;, which are denoted by
sentences with perfective aspect. This has the effect that as long as
&lsquo;processes&rsquo; (thusly conceived) are going on, one cannot
distinguish between&mdash;what intuitively appear to
be&mdash;&lsquo;non-directed&rsquo; goings-on (e.g., a dry
leaf&rsquo;s swirling in the wind) and &lsquo;directed&rsquo;
goings-on (e.g. the metamorphosis of a frog); only retrospectively we
can classify &lsquo;events&rsquo; (thusly conceived) into non-directed
activity-like events and directed developmental events (Stout 2018).
Galton and Mizoguchi (2009) explore in greater detail the logical
differences between processes and events, with Galton later (2012,
2018) settling on a conception of processes as abstract patterns of
&ldquo;states&rdquo;. In parallel, the Vendler/Kenny classification
also launched and reinforced research on actions <em>per se</em>,
i.e., on the logic of action discourse for different types of actions,
see e.g. Stout 1996, 2018; K&uuml;hl 2008. Based on Kenny&rsquo;s
classification, Fink (1973) argues that only certain types of
occurrences can be the subject of value judgments &mdash; an important
result for the ontology of values. These approaches follow by and
large the methodological tradition of P.F. Strawson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;descriptive metaphysics&rdquo; and take the conceptual analysis
of our common-sense reasoning about occurrence types already to
<em>amount</em> to an ontology of occurences. By contrast, Seibt
argues that our common-sensical distinctions among occurrence types
merely provide (<em>some of</em>) the <em>data</em> for a process
ontology. She suggests (2004, 2015b) a classification of basic
occurrence types in terms of inferential networks of sentences with
different aspects (&ldquo;aspectual inference networks&rdquo;). This
has two advantages. First, the above-mentioned distinction between
activity-like goings-on and developmental goings-on can be
drawn&mdash;whether the sentence &lsquo;Max is mending his
shirt&rsquo; denotes an activity-like going-on (Max is doing some
shirt-mending) or a developmental going-on (Max is working towards the
goal of his shirt being mended), follows from the inferences licensed
by the sentence. Second, if occurrence types are not distinguished
with reference to a particular verbal aspect (the
&ldquo;progressive&rdquo;) but with respect to aspectual inference
networks, the classification corrects for language-specific systematic
differences of aspect semantics; in this ways the classification is
more likely to hold across languages.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 See Seibt (2009, 2015, 2018a). More recently the non-particularist
conception has gained more supporters: T. Crowther (2012, 2017)
defends the conception of processes as stuffs against recent
particularist views: M. Soteriou (2013) argues that such a conception
proves advantageous for the task of making sense of the unity of human
experience (2013); and J. Hornsby (2012) has suggested that human
activities are best understood as non-particular individuals.</p>

 See Steward (2012) and Stout (2018), which collects contributions
from main protagonists of this recent process turn in the ontology of
mind. See also below section 4, (iii).</p>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 See Rescher (1996 ch. 3), and Rubenstein (1997). To be sure, the idea
that general or determinable entities are concrete has been around
since Aristotle; the novel twist is to allow for determinable entities
to be &ldquo;subjectless&rdquo; processes (C.D. Broad); see also
Sellars (1981). Deacon (2012) argues that &ldquo;constrained
processing&rdquo; represents generality, since a (e.g., causal)
constraint on what can happen amounts to a removal of specific
features in what is happening. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 For a refurbishment of Whitehead&rsquo;s account of persistence see
Simons (2008) and, in spirit if not in letter, Galton (2006); Seibt
(1997, 2008, 2017) deconstructs the dichotomy of endurance (persistent
entities are identical in time but not extended in time) versus
perdurance (persistent entities exist in time by having a temporal
part that exists at that time) and argues for a &ldquo;recurrence
account&rdquo; of persistence: persisting entities are identical
(i.e., the same <em>concrete</em> non-particular individual) in time
<em>and</em> may be temporally extended. Since Seibt&rsquo;s
&ldquo;dynamics&rdquo; or &ldquo;general processes&rdquo; are
functionally individuated like stuffs, some of them exist in time like
stuffs exist in space; that is, they are not only, as Aristotle
observed, &ldquo;homeomerous&rdquo; (like-parted) in time or space,
but &ldquo;automerous&rdquo; (sameparted) in the sense that they
literally, as the same individual, recur throughout the parts of the
spatial or temporal region in which they occur: they <em>permeate</em>
a region of space, time, or spacetime. For criticism of this account
see Oakes 2017.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 The idea that a process philosophy can put (rudimentary forms of)
normativity into nature is argued in Bickhard (2004, 2022), where
selfmaintenance of far-from-equilibrium systems is explained in terms
of functional presuppositions among processes, and further developed
in Campbell&rsquo;s (2011) study on truth as a property of actions
(see also below, section 4 (iii). Similarly, Deacon (2012) explains
the emergence of information and normativity as in terms of an
increasingly complex architecture of <em>constraints</em> within
natural systems, channeling and redirecting the natural tendency
towards entropy increase. &mdash; As pointed out above in section 1,
in view of recent research on embodied cognition, emergence, and
non-linear mechanistic explanations, it also can be argued that
Wilfrid Sellars&rsquo; naturalism prefigures a process-based
naturalization of normativity, especially since Sellars distinguishes
between different kinds or degrees of normativity (Seibt 2016).</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 For a process view of God as sketched in (v) see Rescher 1996, ch. 9.
In connection with this issue it might be useful to restate the
<em>caveat</em> from section 2, drawing attention to the fact that
this entry does not detail the contributions of process thought to
 <a href="../process-theism/index.html">process theism</a>.
 While many American process philosophers, especially Whiteheadians,
have been inclined to address general theological questions within the
exposition of a process metaphysics, it should be noted that in the
current international research landscape that this article is trying
to do justice to, theism is not an integral element of a process
philosophy. Many researchers currently working on
process-philosophical themes do not consider the nature of God an
inevitable or even legitimate subject for their research. This need
not be taken as an indication of the increasing atheism among process
philosophers, but merely as an effect of the increasing specialization
of academic research. Guided by the philosophy of
 <a href="../hartshorne/index.html">Charles Hartshorne</a>
 and, more recently, stimulated and promoted by the work of J. L. Cobb
and D.R. Griffin, the area of &ldquo;process theology&rdquo; by now
has become a diversified field of inquiry of its own, combining
philosophy of religion and theology (often Christian theology but more
recently also the theology of religions).</p>

 It is not quite clear whether Salmon&rsquo;s analysis of causation
(as well as Dowe&rsquo;s (1992) modification, the &ldquo;conserved
quantity view&rdquo;) is indeed committed to processes in the relevant
sense that distinguishes them from sequences of states; for a process
view of causation where this commitment is explicit see Ingthorsson
(2002).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 In Whiteheadian process metaphysics such mutual dynamic dependencies
are introduced by way of informal definitional
characterizations&mdash;they are included in the description of how
prehensions, subjective aim and subjective form of an actual entity
relate to each other. In a non-Whiteheadian process ontology one might
need to resort to non-standard mereologies in order to state such
dependencies more precisely, see below section 5.</p>
</div>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 For the use of (non-Whiteheadian) process ontology for an
interpretation of certain concepts of chemistry see Needham (1999,
2003) and Guttinger (2017); Stein (2004) has offered a Whiteheadian
process metaphysics for chemistry.</p>

 See the introduction in Nicholson and Dupr&eacute; 2018, as well
earlier arguments in Dupr&eacute; (2012, ch. 10 and 11, partly
co-authored with Maureen O&rsquo;Malley). Surveying results from the
biology of microbes and metagenomics, Dupr&eacute; argues that
phenomena of horizontal or lateral gene transfer as well as
fundamental symbiotic dependencies between microbes and their
embedding multicellular communities present a severe challenge to the
traditional notion of the monogenomic biological individual (organism)
as the focal unit of inheritance and selection. &ldquo;Life is in fact
a hierarchy of processes (e.g., metabolic, developmental, ecological,
evolutionary) and...any abstraction of an ontology of fixed entities
must do some violence to this dynamic reality&rdquo; (p. 188f), which
displays more the form of a net than single lineages within a
&lsquo;tree of life.&rsquo;</p>

 H&auml;ttich (2004) has adapted the Whiteheadian framework for an
interpretation of axiomatic quantum field theory. For more general
expositions of a Whiteheadian approach to the interpretation of
quantum physics see, e.g., Eppersen (2004) and Stapp (2007). The
collected volume by Eastman, Epperson, and Griffin (2016) offers new
perspectives on cross-fertilizations between (quantum) physics and
speculative philosophy, with focus on the role, and the metaphysical
interpretation of, of potentiality. Some contributors set out a
framework of &ldquo;relational realism&rdquo; that includes a modal
realism; e.g., operating with category theory instead of set theory,
Michael Epperson (2016) and Elias Zafiris (2016) explore new
approaches to the decoherence interpretation of measurement, treating
the difference between actuality and potentiality as a feature of
reality. Other contributors promote &ldquo;process physics&rdquo;
outright as an &ldquo;information-theoretic modeling of
reality&rdquo;) (Klinger 2016, Cahill 2016). Since the tension between
relativity theory and quantum physics notoriously has forced physics
currently into a mode of theory formation that is in the vicinity of
speculative thought, it is here where philosophical explorations may
have particular heuristic value for science. Moreover, given that here
an space of inquiry has opened up that can benefit from fresh ideas,
the philosophical mainstream may do well to pay attention to proposals
that explore new explanatory models (see for example C.
Carlson&rsquo;s (2004, 2009) suggestion to ground space-time and
energy in causal networks of basic chunks of becoming
(&ldquo;time&rdquo;); J. Brenner&rsquo;s suggestion to refurbish
dialectics in connection with information-theoretic modelling (Brenner
2008, 2010); or T. Eastman&rsquo;s (2021) proposal to combine Boolean
and non-Boolean logics to arrive at a systematic interpretation of
reality including the quantum-physical domain). </p>

 See e.g., Rovelli 2014, 2020. As highlighted recently by Martin
Calamari (2021), Rovelli&rsquo;s conception of becoming presents a
profound challenge to mainstream analytical ontology and metaphysics,

 See e.g., Bickhard (2000, 2022) and Campbell/Bickhard (2011), as well
as Wimsatt (1997), where emergence and reducibility are defined in
terms of types of interactions with a physical system. Within the
context of (partly speculative) molecular biology, Deacon (2012)
offers a detailed description of the process structures that realize
the emergences of two distinctive dynamics,
&ldquo;morphodynamics&rdquo; (in other parlance
&ldquo;self-maintenance&rdquo; or &ldquo;autopoiesis&rdquo;) and
&ldquo;teleodynamics&rdquo; (akin to Bickhard&rsquo;s &ldquo;recursive
selfmaintenance&rdquo;), which each are (partly
&lsquo;self&rsquo;-referential) constraint structures on thermodynamic
processes of energy dissipation (&ldquo;homeodynamics&rdquo;). </p>

 For the first articulation of a process view of cognition see
especially the work of Mark Bickhard, a longstanding protagonist of
the &ldquo;interactivist&rdquo; outlook on cognition as
cross-disciplinary intersection for research in cognitive science,
psychology, and philosophy; Bickhard&rsquo;s many papers center on
embodied cognition but in effect lay out a comprehensive naturalist
process metaphysics, which he recently has been able to summarize in
one comprehensive exposition (Bickhard 2022). &ndash; Proponents of
process-based or interaction-based approaches to cognition,
information, and representation do not always agree on the description
of the decisive process architectures. On Bickhard&rsquo;s view
low-grade forms of cognition can be attributed to systems with certain
process architectures independently of the causal evolutionary history
of these systems; in contrast, Terrence Deacon (2010, 2012) has argued
that the evolutionary embedding of a certain dynamics is
definitionally constitutive for the occurrence of information. While
Bickhard and Deacon aim to describe in some detail the process
architectures that accomplish various aspects of 4E cognition, the
most recent work on enacted predictive processing has only begun to
explore in greater detail the ontological significance of mathematical
descriptions of the mind as process (see e.g. Maxwell et al.
2021).</p>

 In Zemach 1970 and Roberts 1979 we find early suggestions that
processes endure in time; Stout (2015) even speaks of &ldquo;occurrent
continuants.&rdquo; See also

 Galton (2017a, 2017b, 2023) suggests that what appear to be different
types of continuants (e.g., chunks of matter, objects, assemblies,
organisms, or collectives) are different sorts of processual
complexes, which can be distinguished by way of determining which
processes perform a taxonomic set of roles (such as formation,
persistence, impingement, resilience, destruction). Similarly,
&ldquo;General Process Theory&rdquo; maintains as a research
hypothesis that a five-dimensional classificatory matrix suffices to
define processes that are the ontological counterparts for all basic
types of concrete entities that common-sense and scientific reasoning
is committed to; the first of these dimensions distinguishes ten ways
in which a dynamics is distributed in space and time (Seibt 2015,
2018).</p>

 &ldquo;Levelled mereology&rdquo; (Seibt 2009, 2015a) is a
non-transitive mereology that allows for formal representations of
process structures with feedback loops and certain forms of
self-referentiality, including representations of dynamic wholes whose
functioning both conditions and is conditioned by their parts. Such
process structures with whole-part interdependencies constitute a
distinctive explanatory advantage, as illustrated by the
process-philosophical account of personhood in section 3 above.</p>

<h2>The Logical Structure of the Method of Cases</h2>

<p>
If one considers the four examples of the method of cases in
 <a href="index-2.html#MethCase">&sect;2.2</a>,
 it may seem that their logical structure is clear. One begins with a
candidate generalization, theory, or analysis which is put in terms of
a necessary bi-conditional. Then, by appeal to a hypothetical case,
one justifies the claim that it is possible for the
<em>analysandum</em> property to be absent though the properties
alleged by the analysis to be sufficient are present or one justifies
the claim it is possible for the <em>analysandum</em> property to be
present though some property alleged by the analysis to be necessary
is lacking.</p>

<p>
As this sketch would have it, the proposition which entails the
falsity of the analysis in question is justified in some manner by the
content of an intuition. However, Williamson (2007) argues, in
connection with the Gettier intuition, that difficulties are revealed
by considering how to formalize the implicit argument. In particular,
as a hypothetical case is being described, one may wonder about the
precise content of the allegedly refuting intuition. After all, the
scenario contemplated is not believed to be actual. In light of the
traditional rationalist&rsquo;s view that intuition reveals necessary
truths, consider a regimentation on which the central intuition has as
its content a claim about necessity:</p>

<table class="cell-rl cellpad-small indent">
<tr><td>\(\mathrm{K}(x, p)\):</td>
  <td><i>x</i> knows that <i>p</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>\(\textrm{JTB}(x, p)\):</td>
  <td><i>x</i> has a justified true belief that <i>p</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>\(\textrm{GC}(x, p)\):</td>
  <td><i>x</i> stands to <i>p</i> as in the Gettier text.</td></tr>
</table>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(1)</span>
<span class="sen">\(\Diamond \exists x\exists p\textrm{GC}(x, p)\)
</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(2)</span>
<span class="sen">
\(\Box \forall x\forall p (\textrm{GC}(x, p) \supset (\textrm{JTB}(x, p) \amp{\sim}\mathrm{K}(x, p)))\)</span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore, </p> 

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(3)</span>
<span class="sen">\(\Diamond \exists x\exists p (\textrm{JTB}(x, p) \amp{\sim}\mathrm{K}(x, p))\)
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
(3) contradicts the JTB theory, construed as </p> 

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag"></span>
<span class="sen">\(\Box \forall x\forall p (\textrm{JTB}(x, p) = \mathrm{K}(x, p)).\)
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
The problem with this account, as Williamson points out, is that (2)
is false because the relation \(\textrm{GC}(x, p)\) is, in virtue of
the incompleteness of Gettier&rsquo;s description, one which may be
instantiated in a variety of ways. Some of those possible
instantiations are cases in which the subject lacks justified true
belief which is not knowledge. One, for example, is a case in which
<i>x</i> has further evidence which undermines the justification of
<i>x</i>&rsquo;s belief that <i>p</i> and renders false the claim that
<i>S</i>&rsquo;s belief is justified. Another involves further
independent evidence for <i>p</i> or some other fact which renders
false the claim that <i>S</i>&rsquo;s belief that <i>p</i> is not
knowledge.</p>

<p>
Williamson&rsquo;s own response to this worry is to weaken (2) to a
counterfactual claim, yielding the following:</p> 

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(1)</span>
<span class="sen">\(\Diamond \exists x\exists p\,\textrm{GC}(x, p)\)
</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(2c)</span>
<span class="sen">
\(\exists x\exists p\,\textrm{GC}(x, p)
\boxright
\forall x\forall p (\textrm{GC}(x, p) \supset (\textrm{JTB}(x, p) \amp{\sim}\mathrm{K}(x, p)))\)
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore, </p> 

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(3)</span>
<span class="sen">
\(\Diamond \exists x\exists p (\textrm{JTB}(x, p) \amp{\sim}\mathrm{K}(x, p))\)
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
(Williamson admits (2007: 195&ndash;6) that (2c) is not a completely
adequate formalization of the anaphora in the ordinary language
subjunctive he seeks to capture&mdash;&ldquo;If a thinker were to
stand to a proposition as in the Gettier text, he/she would have
justified belief in it without knowledge.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>
This account of the second premise of the argument has been alleged to
be problematic (Ichikawa and Jarvis 2009; Malmgren 2011). First, the
counterfactual it features is a contingent truth, justified, if at
all, on <em>a posteriori</em> grounds. Hence, a typical philosophical
appeal to intuition yields, surprisingly, an <em>a posteriori</em>
conclusion. Second, the premise is false if the actual world (or
nearest possible one) contains a confounding realization of the
Gettier story&mdash;a realization in which the subject has knowledge
that <i>p</i> or lacks justification for believing that <i>p</i>. If
so, then Gettier&rsquo;s case is not really a counterexample to the
JTB theory. Third, we are not in a position to rule out such
confounding realizations with assurance. Hence, we seem substantially
less justified than we normally take ourselves to be in thinking that
Gettier provided a counterexample the JTB theory.</p>

<p>
Geddes (forthcoming) provides an related reconstruction which may
ameliorate the second and third difficulties just raised for
Williamson&rsquo;s account. On his reconstruction, the informal
counterfactual conditional formalized in (2c) is modified so as to
hold that if someone were to stand to a proposition <i>p</i> as in the
Gettier case, then, &ldquo;<em>normally</em>, he would have a
justified true belief that <i>p</i> but not know that <i>p</i>.&rdquo;
While providing no formal semantics for this conditional, Geddes
suggests that we understand it adequately and that it is (1) true and
inconsistent with the JTB theory and, (2) not falsified if there is an
actual or close Gettier case in which the agent knows that <i>p</i> or
is not justified in believing <i>p</i>. Still, the claim appears
plausibly <em>a posteriori</em> and contingent. </p>

<p>
A third solution (Williamson 2007: 202), is to weaken (2c) to:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(2pc)</span>
<span class="sen">
\(\Diamond(\exists x\exists p\, \textrm{GC}(x, p) \boxright \forall x\forall p (\textrm{GC}(x, p) \supset (\textrm{JTB}(x, p) \amp{\sim}\mathrm{K}(x, p)))).\)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
(2pc) would avoid the concerns noted above about (2c) and Williamson
allows that S5 would enable us to deduce (3) from (1) and (2pc).
Still, he rejects this reconstruction because it requires, unlike the
argument from (1) and (2c), (a) the correctness of the relevant
principles of S5 and (b) the attribution of a commitment to such
principles to people who have never considered them.</p>

<p>
A fourth solution, defended by Ichikawa and Jarvis (2009), appeals to
the distinction between what is <em>explicitly stated in</em> the text
of a fictional story and what is <em>true in</em> the fiction. While
Williamson&rsquo;s worry gains its purchase from the fact that a
fictional <em>text</em> can be consistently &ldquo;filled out&rdquo;
in different ways, the alleged fact that many fictional truths are not
explicitly stated in a fictional text provides a way of endeavoring to
block the worry. For example, it allows one to claim that it is true
in the Gettier story (though not explicitly stated in the Gettier
text) that the subject does not have further evidence or knowledge
which would undermine her justification. Letting the set of
propositions <em>true in</em> Gettier&rsquo;s fiction be named
&ldquo;SET,&rdquo; a person may, upon encountering Gettier&rsquo;s
text, consider the proposition, <i>g</i>, that every proposition in
SET is true. Ichikawa and Jarvis allege that this is possible even
though one has not entertained in <em>propia persona</em> each of the
propositions in SET because the content is in some way
demonstrative&mdash;things are like <em>that</em>. Then (setting aside
worries about fictional proper names) the Gettier reasoning might be
formalized as follows:</p> 

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(1f)</span>
<span class="sen">\(\Diamond g\)
</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(2f)</span>
<span class="sen">
\(\Box(g \supset \exists x\exists p (\textrm{JTB}(x, p) \amp{\sim}\mathrm{K}(x, p)))\)
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore, </p> 

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(3)</span>
<span class="sen">
\(\exists x\exists p (\textrm{JTB}(x, p) \amp{\sim}\mathrm{K}(x, p))\)
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
One worry about this account is that statements about fictional truth
are, on the most influential account (Lewis 1978), analyzed in
counterfactual terms. On such a view, which set of propositions
constitutes the set to which a given agent is related by encountering
a fictional text depends on contingent facts about what their world is
like. Hence, as Williamson (2009: 466) points out, contingencies can
prevent one from knowing the truth of the relevant instance of (2f),
even if one has encountered and understood the Gettier text. (See
Malmgren 2011 for further objections to this proposal and to other
attempts to rescue (2) by changing its embedded proposition.)</p>

<p>
A fifth solution, which also holds that the second premise of the
reconstruction invokes a strict implication, is provided by Grundmann
and Horvath (2014a, 2014b). They suggest that the Gettier case can be
enriched with sufficient facts about <i>S</i>&rsquo;s justification
for believing <i>p</i> to rule out the intuitively deviant
realizations (those which fail to involve justified true belief which
is not knowledge). One benefit of the proposal is that it makes the
Gettier intuition independent of contingent facts about the actual
world. However, it seems quite uncertain that a similar move can be
provided to rule out deviant realizations of other thought experiment
cases. Moreover, the psychological means by which those who consider
Gettier&rsquo;s limited textual description arrive at the much
enriched content required by this proposal, and the manner of their
grasping this enriched content, remains unclear.</p>

<p>
A sixth solution (Malmgren 2011) holds that the Gettier premise is the
simple claim that it is possible that some <i>x</i> stand to some
<i>p</i> as does the subject in the Gettier text and to have justified
true belief that <i>p</i> while lacking knowledge that <i>p</i>. More
precisely, it is</p> 

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(1*)</span>
<span class="sen">
\(\Diamond \exists x\exists p (\textrm{GC}(x, p) \amp \textrm{JTB}(x, p) \amp{\sim}\mathrm{K}(x, p))\)
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
(1*) entails, without the aid of other premises, (3). That there are
possible realizations of the Gettier text in which the person would
fail to have JTB but not knowledge is irrelevant to the truth of
(1*).</p>

<p>
It might be objected that this proposal makes the intuition&rsquo;s
content too close to a simple denial of the JTB theory. However, this
worry can be assuaged if one recalls that the JTB theory has little or
no intuitive justification of its own and was justifiably accepted by
its proponents only on the grounds that it provided the best account
of our pre-Gettier intuitions. Geddes (forthcoming) raises worries
about how Malmgren&rsquo;s proposal handles cases in which people deny
the Gettier claim. Malmgren&rsquo;s proposal seems to imply that one
who holds that Gettier&rsquo;s subject neither has a justified true
belief, nor knows, that <i>p</i>, is holding that it is possible that
<i>S</i> stand to a proposition <i>p</i> as in the Gettier case and
that <i>S</i> fail to have justified belief or knowledge that
<i>p</i>. That claim, however, is true and does not contradict the
orthodox claim about the Gettier case. Ichikawa and Jarvis (2013)
object to Malmgren&rsquo;s account that one might reject the standard
claim about the Gettier case but still accept (1*) because one thinks
there are other possible cases of JTB without knowledge which are
compossible with the Gettier case.</p>

<p>
Much of the relevant literature appears to assume that
Williamson&rsquo;s worry will arise for any appeal to a hypothetical
case. Williamson himself adopts</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the background working hypothesis &hellip; that [Gettier&rsquo;s]
thought experiments are paradigmatic, in the sense that if any thought
experiments can succeed in philosophy, his do: thus to determine
whether Gettier&rsquo;s thought experiments succeed is in effect to
determine whether there can be successful thought experiments in
philosophy. (2007: 179&ndash;180) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, there may be cases in which the relevant second premise is
not, even formalized as a necessary universal quantification, open to
Williamson&rsquo;s worry. Consider, as one example, the standard New
Evil Demon case, in which we are to suppose that there are persons who
have (and have always had) internal mental lives exactly like our own
but who are radically deceived by an evil demon (Cohen 1984). The
intuition that they are justified in believing as they do is taken to
refute a crude form of reliabilism. Here, the ambitious reading of (2)
appears to go through:</p>

<table class="cell-rl cellpad-small indent">
<tr><td>\(\mathrm{J}(x, p)\):</td>
  <td><i>x</i> is justified in believing <i>p</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>\(\textrm{ED}(x, p)\):</td>
  <td><i>x</i> stands to <i>p</i> as in the Evil Demon story.</td></tr>
<tr><td>\(\textrm{R}(x, p)\):</td>
  <td><i>x</i>&rsquo;s belief that <i>p</i> is reliably produced.</td></tr>
</table>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(1)</span>
<span class="sen">
\(\Diamond \exists x\exists p\, \textrm{ED} (x, p)\)
</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(2)</span>
<span class="sen">
\(\Box \forall x\forall p\,\textrm{ED}(x, p) \supset (\mathrm{J}(x, p) \amp{\sim}\mathrm{R}(x, p)))\)
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Therefore, </p> 

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(3)</span>
<span class="sen">
\(\Diamond \exists x\exists p (\textrm{J}(x, p) \amp{\sim}\textrm{R}(x, p))\)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
(3) contradicts a reliabilist theory of justified belief according to
which \(\Box \forall x\forall p (\mathrm{J}(x, p) = \mathrm{R}(x,
p))\).</p>

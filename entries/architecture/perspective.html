<h2><a id="ArcAncEarModTho">1. Architecture In Ancient and Early Modern Thought</a></h2>

<p>Just as the history of philosophical aesthetics subsequent to Plato
and Aristotle and prior to Baumgarten represents a relatively thin
canon, a similar judgment applies to philosophical explorations of the
nature and fundamental concepts of architecture. Indeed, as Plato and
Aristotle have little to say on the topic, the pre-Baumgarten
catalogue of philosophical accounts of architecture is even more
slender.</p>

<p>Of Plato&rsquo;s brief pronouncements on the topic, perhaps best
known is his exoneration of architecture as it promotes the social
good and as a non-mimetic, hence non-deceptive, artform (as contrasts
with sculpture). He further characterizes architecture and allied
enterprises (<em>Philebus</em> 56b-c) as progressing through exact
measurement&mdash;comparing favorably with music, which relies in its
development on iterative experience. Plato also locates the kind of
knowledge architecture represents in the domain of the
<em>praktik&ecirc;</em>
(&pi;&rho;&alpha;&kappa;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#942;, knowing how), as
aligned with <em>techn&ecirc;</em> (&tau;&#941;&chi;&nu;&eta;, the
practical arts) and in contrast with <em>gnostik&ecirc;</em>
(&gamma;&nu;&omega;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&eta;, experientially
knowing that) or <em>epist&ecirc;m&ecirc;</em>
(&#7952;&pi;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#942;&mu;&eta;, by way of theory or
reason knowing that). Such practical knowledge is delivered not as
judgments (as with mathematics) but as instructions or commands, in
the manner of managerial knowledge (<em>The Statesman</em>
260a-b). Beyond these fleeting remarks, a Platonist legacy in
architectural thought may be located in the influence of idealism. As
Mitrovic (2011) suggests, Greek, Roman, and Renaissance interest in
optical correction reflects concerns about bringing perceptions of
concretely realized structures in line with corresponding ideal
architectural &ldquo;forms&rdquo;, or about departures from
proportions of works described by such forms. In contemporary
philosophy of architecture, Platonism is mooted in the question as to
whether, <em>per</em> an abstractist thesis, such ideal objects are
the uniquely actual, or (more modestly) most real, architectural
objects.</p>

<p>Aristotle joins Plato in largely speaking of architecture not as a
central topic of interest but in order to make a point. Thus,
Aristotle presents the four causes drawing on the example of causal
roles in the architecture of a temple (<em>Physics</em> 2.3). For
example, the architect&rsquo;s idea of the temple, as realized through
craftsmanship of the workers whom the architect commands, represents
the efficient cause of the temple&mdash;whereas the architect&rsquo;s
vision of or plan for the temple (not necessarily realized) provides
the formal cause. Elsewhere, pursuing a holist picture of biological
explorations as the &ldquo;total form&rdquo; of animals, Aristotle
draws a comparison with &ldquo;the true object of architecture&rdquo;,
which he notes is &ldquo;&hellip;not bricks, mortar, or timber, but
the house&rdquo; (<em>Parts of Animals</em>, Book I).</p>

<p>In like fashion, there are short, instrumental references to
architects or architecture in Plotinus, Augustine, Thomas of Aquinas,
Descartes, and others still. One hallmark of most such references is a
focus on architecture as craft, trade, or skill, rather in the manner
that Plato&mdash;or, for that matter, Vitruvius&mdash;saw the
discipline. Against this background, Francis Bacon offers an early
entry in addressing architectural matters in exceptionally
non-instrumental fashion. He opens his brief essay &ldquo;Of
Building&rdquo; (<em>Essays, or Counsels Civil and Moral</em>) with a
pronouncement still prized by modern-day architectural functionalists:
&ldquo;Houses are built to live in, and not to look on&rdquo;. That
said, visual aspects are not forgotten and he reminds us of the
imperative for order and symmetry: &ldquo;Therefore let use be
preferred before uniformity, except where both may be had&rdquo;
(1625: XLV, 257). Utility, however, remains the focal point of this
essay, relative to calculating the site for a princely house, and
making accommodations in fine house design to meet weather conditions,
circulatory needs, and like parameters.</p>

<h2><a id="GerEnlWolKanHegSch">2. German Enlightenment: Wolff, Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer</a></h2>

<p>A greater awareness of architecture as an artform&mdash;and thus, a
greater philosophical focus&mdash;commences with Batteux&rsquo;s
inclusion of architecture among the arts (1746). However, even as
independent of the birth of modern aesthetics, Wolff offers an account
that, like Bacon&rsquo;s, focuses on architecture more in the manner
of a <em>craft</em> or <em>scientific discipline</em> (Buchenau 2013;
Guyer 2007/2014). In Baconian fashion, Wolff exalts the
craftsman&rsquo;s maker&rsquo;s knowledge (&ldquo;historical
knowledge&rdquo;, for Wolff), where experimentation contributes to a
broader understanding of phenomena and method (1746).  In
this spirit, Wolff counts architecture among the empirical arts of
invention (<em>ars inveniendi</em>), along with physics and medicine,
wherein we arrive at new truths as based on available truths
(1751). Looking at architecture in disciplinary terms, he counts
it as a branch of applied mathematics, with systematized rules that
govern real-world phenomena. One hallmark of Wolff&rsquo;s account is
seeing architecture fundamentally as an undertaking, and derivatively
as a product. Architecture is &ldquo;&hellip;the science of creating a
building in such a way that it conforms with the architect&rsquo;s
main intentions&rdquo; (1750&ndash;57).</p>

<p>Wolff, rare among philosophers, looks to Vitruvius and the
subsequent tradition as a source of architectural
principles&mdash;which, in particular, identify Greek architecture as
a model. While Wolff endorses the full Vitruvian triad as imperatives,
he emphasizes a linkage between two principles in particular:
structural soundness must be tied to beauty, and visible to the
spectator. Also in line with Vitruvian thought, Wolff proposes that,
to attain the sort of harmony that yields architectural perfection,
architects deploy special disciplinary knowledge developed out of
experience with construction. This knowledge comprises rules for
promoting &ldquo;coherence&rdquo; in design and meeting the
structure&rsquo;s use as intended by the architect
(1750&ndash;57).</p>

<p>When Batteux (1746) suggests that architecture belongs to the
family of artforms, he present this designation with utility still the
driving force&mdash;proposing that while architecture flourishes out
of necessity, it is taste that perfects its art. This epigram hints at
a key theme of Kant&rsquo;s account. Success in architectural design
consists in attaining beauty of form in light of functionality or, in
Kantian terms, an adherent (non-free) beauty in buildings as defined
by realization of their intended goal-state (<em>Critique of the Power
of Judgment</em>, 1790). Guyer (2011) sees an echo of the
Vitruvian premium on utility and firmity; Wolff&rsquo;s theory of
perfections also seems close to hand. A second theme, as Guyer notes,
is Kant&rsquo;s emphasis&mdash;as a piece of his cognitivism&mdash;on
the expressive capacity of architecture relative to aesthetic,
idealized notions of function, structure, and physical
forces. Specifically, architecture expresses aesthetic ideas through
forms, materials, and use of space; the range of ideas that can be
expressed is constrained by the fit of the architectural object to its
intended use (1790).</p>

<p>Kant&rsquo;s legacy in architectural thought is diverse, extending
beyond his brief remarks on architecture or even his aesthetics.
Guyer suggests that Kant provides a starting point for all
expressivist theories of architecture. Mitrovic (2011) proposes that,
via his notion of disinterested judgment (not focused on
architecture), Kant sets the stage for subsequent formalist
claims&mdash;like those of Geoffrey Scott (1914/1924)&mdash;that (a)
aesthetic judgments of form across persons should yield similar
judgments and (b) aesthetic judgments are best understood as divorced
from associations with a work&rsquo;s meaning or any connected
concepts. Scruton (1979/2013), though not a formalist, proposes a
contemplative model of architectural experience that also builds on a
Kantian cognitive engagement with the aesthetic that&mdash;in
disinterested fashion&mdash;does not rely on architecture&rsquo;s
practical aspects. More broadly, phenomenological approaches
(Heidegger, Gadamer, Harries) suggest that architecture&mdash;as
analogous with a Kantian conceptual framework&mdash;structures our
experience of the world around us. </p>

<p>Hegel (1826) happily embraces Kant&rsquo;s categorization of
architecture as art and is especially enthusiastic about its
expressive nature. Architecture for Hegel is primary among the arts in
expressing cognitive content generally&mdash;the Absolute
Spirit&mdash;as an aspect of organizing the natural environment.  At
the same time, architecture, along with art as a whole, fails to
express the Absolute Spirit as well as religion or philosophy, which
feature greater linguistic capacity and are not weighted down with an
unavoidable symbolism. This is true even of the Gothic, which Hegel
takes as an ultimate (if qualified) success in the history of
architecture for its metaphorical communication of spirit. As with
history in general, Hegel offers a progressive account of
architectural history, wherein successive stages (the
&ldquo;Symbolic&rdquo;, Classical, and Romantic periods) bring an
increasing freedom among architectural objects from symbolism and
purpose, and enhanced expression of the Absolute Spirit. This
progressive view of history and the vision of a collective historical
force strongly influence a common strain of architectural theory,
wherein design reflects the spirit of the times. This theme is
pervasive in twentieth century architectural advocacy and
historiography (Watkin 1984/2001).</p>

<p>Like Hegel, Schopenhauer (1818/1844 [<em>WWR</em>]) rates
architecture by its expressive capacities; however, he reaches the
opposite conclusion, ranking architecture among the lowest of
artforms&mdash;as against music, his benchmark standard. Architecture
reveals ideas of natural and formal qualities found in the work; these
are primarily the &ldquo;dullest visibilities of the Will&rdquo;, such
as the gravity, rigidity, and other properties of stone (<em>World as
Will and Representation</em> (<em>WWR</em>) I) but include ideas of
light, as well. Like all arts, architecture features &ldquo;aesthetic
material&rdquo;, or a theme for artistic content; in the case of
architecture this theme is the conflict between (a) gravity, the
tendency of the building&rsquo;s mass to pull downward, and (b)
rigidity, the capacity of the building&rsquo;s structure and parts to
prevent collapse (<em>WWR</em> I). The central aesthetic challenge of
architecture, correspondingly, is artistic communication of these
(lowly) forces&mdash;also referred to as &ldquo;load&rdquo; and
&ldquo;support&rdquo; (<em>WWR</em> II)&mdash;in varied forms of
tension. Taking this challenge as the primary driver in structural
design, Schopenhauer takes aim at a standard view in architectural
theory, the claim&mdash;in Vitruvius and elsewhere&mdash;that the
classical column is proportional to natural forms (the human form, in
the Vitruvian instance). The column design <em>has</em> to be
load-bearing, Schopenhauer notes. So to look to a natural forms origin
of its proportions is to suggest, oddly, that load-bearing is merely a
happy coincidence with the accident of proportion fitting to that of
the human body (or, alternatively, a tree trunk) (<em>WWR</em> II;
Korab-Karpowicz 2012; Schwarzer, 1996).  The proposal that
architecture communicates its structural features echoes Kant&rsquo;s
expansive expressivism and, as Guyer (2011) notes, anticipates Ruskin
and modernist views.</p>

<h2><a id="SciAesEinTra">3. The Science of Aesthetics and Einf&uuml;hlung Traditions</a></h2>

<p>Over the latter half of the nineteenth century, the science of
aesthetics (<em>Kunstwissenschaft</em>) movement advanced the proposal
that art and its qualities&mdash;especially beauty&mdash;are subject
to scientific analysis on par with the natural or formal sciences.
Among putative reasons for this proposal, we find the suggestions that
beauty and such qualities are phenomena which, like those of physics
or chemistry, may be measured, explained, predicted, and subject to
normative characterization. Some talk of science seems to have been
<em>fa&ccedil;on de parler</em>, as exemplified by Henry Noble
Day&rsquo;s <em>The Science of Aesthetics, or the nature, kinds, laws,
and uses of Beauty</em> (1872/1888), which traces aesthetics as a
science back to Baumgarten and the origin of the term aesthetics, and
enunciates a variety of putative &ldquo;laws&rdquo; governing the
arts. Science and its laws are taken here more as metaphor than
literal practice. For architecture, Day suggested special laws,
including a <em>Law of the Idea in Architecture</em>: the idea of
shelter is the fundamental architectural idea. On the whole, though,
the science of aesthetics movement encouraged an earnest scientific
focus on art&mdash;independent of traditional aesthetics&mdash;in
experimental psychology and among the <em>Einf&uuml;hlung</em>
(empathy) theorists.</p>

<p>Helmholtz is primarily responsible for crafting a
<em>kunstphysiologie</em> encompassing studies of measured sensation
and perception as a physiological approach to aesthetics (Hatfield
1993). His concerns regarding art included cognitive facets of
aesthetics&mdash;in physiological and psychological studies of
sensation as relate to music and painting&mdash;and cognitive function
in art as compared with science. Other early experimentalists included
Wundt&rsquo;s spatial perception studies, suggesting the importance of
active attention (<em>Outlines of Psychology</em>, 1896/1907);
and Fechner&rsquo;s comparative measures of preferences across
persons, which he takes to yield universally valid, if modest, claims
about aesthetic choice. Fechner&rsquo;s most famous study of
preferences (1876) appears to bolster a long-standing claim of
architectural theorists since Vitruvius: given a set of rectangles of
various dimensions, he found, respondents tend to find most pleasing
those whose proportions conform to the &ldquo;golden section&rdquo;
(1:1.618), and find most displeasing long and narrow rectangles. (The
study has been widely repeated&mdash;with mixed results.)</p>

<p>Against Fechner, Volkelt (1905) complained that the artificial
laboratory environment contorts our aesthetic preferences. In
particular, we do not exhibit <em>empathy</em> with simple aesthetic
stimuli, as we do with complex, whole artworks. Volkelt and fellow
<em>einf&uuml;hlung</em> theorists promoted understanding of empathic
experience of perceptual objects as an alternate psychological
approach to cognition and appreciation of art and architecture.  As
concerns architecture in particular, W&ouml;lfflin (1886)
proposes that we grasp the nature and psychological function of
architectural objects and their elements through an empathic
relationship&mdash;seeing oneself in the form&mdash;as undergirded by
physiological and formalist features of experience. Formal modes of
architecture&mdash;horizontality, verticality,
proportionality&mdash;and the expressive nature of ornament are alike
the products of our physical and sensory capacities. G&ouml;ller
(1887; Mallgrave 2005) uses the projective character of
einf&uuml;hlung theory to develop an account of architectural
<em>style</em>, starting with the proposal that architecture alone
among the arts features &ldquo;visible pure form&rdquo;, or form which
is constitutive of objects in the medium and which (inclusive of
lines, light, and shade) lacks representational or necessarily
historical content. Sets of architectural forms collectively
constitute <em>styles</em>&mdash;which meet common physiological
standards <em>and</em> feature temporally and culturally local
character&mdash;upon which architects draw. The greater the
commonality of such forms and our mental images of them, the greater
the pleasure we associate with them, until a saturation point
(representing overuse) after which our pleasure diminishes
greatly. Architects may recoup the ability to arouse pleasure through
exploration of new forms. Into the twentieth century,
<em>einf&uuml;hlung</em> theory continued to gain adherents among
European and American architects and critics, including Scott, in his
<em>Architecture of Humanism</em> (1914/1924); Richard Neutra (Lavin
2004); and the Serbian architect Milutin Borisavljevic (1923, 1954),
who in a second career pursued an experimental science of architecture
focused on Fechner-style perception studies <em>and</em> empathic
reception.</p>

<h2><a id="ConTra">4. Continental Traditions</a></h2>

<p>Continental traditions dominate the history of twentieth century
philosophy of architecture, relative to philosophical output and
influence on architectural theory. To a limited extent, those
traditions have even influenced architectural practice. The primary
movement in this regard is phenomenology; hermeneutics and
post-structuralism play lesser roles. </p>

<p><em>Phenomenology. </em> In response to the rise of scientific
psychology (of experimental or other variants), early phenomenologists
cast doubt on whether we experience the world and its objects in
objective fashion. Instead, they proposed that we
characterize&mdash;in as intersubjectively meaningful fashion as
possible&mdash;first-person experience. Given the centrality of
experience to architectural judgment and the role of architecture in
physically shaping people&rsquo;s experiences, it was perhaps
unsurprising that phenomenologists took an interest in
architecture. </p>

<p>A first step in that direction was the proposal of Merleau-Ponty
(1945) that our existence in the world is best understood through
ways it is shaped by bodily experience of our surroundings. That
bodily experience is relative to what appears in our visual field, to
our tactile and kinesthetic engagement (hence to our position and
motion), and to who we are as individuals and group members.
Phenomenologists and others (J. Robinson 2012) offer an architectural
application: our experience of the built environment shapes our
appreciation of, and abilities to negotiate, our surroundings. If so,
then merely <em>looking</em> at architectural objects is woefully
inadequate to the task of judging their value or utility; physical
experience emerges as the defining feature of understanding an
architectural object, and that feature shapes (or <em>should</em>
shape) architectural creation.</p>

<p>Two principal paths of exploration are open to the architectural
phenomenologist. First, an account is sought as to how design of the
built environment influences experience, perception, feeling, or
behavior. Thus, one&rsquo;s experience of architecture <em>en
gros</em> is analyzed in the manner of a classic phenomenological
account of, say, one&rsquo;s experience of color <em>en gros</em>
(Mitias 1999b). The <em>locus classicus</em> for this approach is
Heidegger (1951), who proposes that the act of building a
structure has the central end of creating &ldquo;place&rdquo; by
connecting spaces in or around the built structure. Further, and as
advanced through such acts of connection, creating &ldquo;place&rdquo;
also requires development of human relationships to one&rsquo;s
surrounding spaces&mdash;what Heidegger refers to as
&ldquo;dwelling&rdquo;. The proposal that the built environment
structures the identity of a given place&mdash;hence our experience
thereof&mdash;enjoys wide appreciation in architectural circles,
following its embrace in popular accounts by Rasmussen (1959) and
Norberg-Schulz (1980). More recently, Harries (1997) has proposed, as
a counterweight to &ldquo;sense of place&rdquo;, that the communal
responsibilities of architecture demand a phenomenological grasp of a
&ldquo;sense of space&rdquo; in which we freely move about. The
structure of our experience in architecture, in short, is not just of
personal but as well public and collective character. </p>

<p>Phenomenological analysis of architecture faces a range of
potential problems. For one, there are limits to what our experience
of architectural objects can tell us about them. A broader grasp of
architectural objects should engage whatever counts as objective facts
about those objects. For another, even short of objectivity, the
variety of our architectural first-person experiences may not allow
enduring, cross-cultural, or even cross-person experiential access to
a given object, its context, and or relations&mdash;or how the object
structures spatial or other experience. This leaves phenomenological
analysis overly context-bound. Finally, if we can make significant
aesthetic choices regarding architectural objects with no varied
effect on a person&rsquo;s experiences, then phenomenological analysis
has limited value for the aesthetics of architecture.</p>

<p>An anomalous but significant work in the phenomenological tradition
is Ingarden (1962), in which he extends to architecture his
theory of art objects as &ldquo;purely intentional&rdquo;, or emerging
as the product of consciousness. For Ingarden, architectural objects,
like other art objects, require that architect and spectator construct
aesthetic qualities of the object to give it its identity as an
architectural object, in addition to recognizing the constituent
collections of constituent materials and parts. Their &ldquo;doubly
founded&rdquo; character acknowledges each object&rsquo;s objective,
material base. Architectural objects are also, to a degree, culturally
bound and socially determined: we see a building as an architectural
object of a particular kind (e.g., church) because we are aware that
it is has been dedicated as such by design and in accordance with
social and cultural standards and expectations. As architectural
objects of <em>that</em> kind, they are <em>partly</em> socially
constructed.</p>

<p>Ingarden&rsquo;s focus on the creative act of consciousness is
suggestive of a second principal path for architectural
phenomenologists: seeking an account as to how experience, perception,
feeling, or behavior may influence design of the built
environment. Variants on this path are also available to social and
environmental psychologists as well as practicing architects (Holl,
Pallasmaa, and P&eacute;rez-G&oacute;mez 1994).</p>

<p><em>Hermeneutics.</em> In contrast to Ingarden&rsquo;s notion that
intentions are constitutive of architectural objects, Gadamer
(1960) suggests that our <em>appreciation</em> of them relies on
access to intentions. Following his general hermeneutics, the key to
an architectural object&rsquo;s meaning is original design intent. The
architect as creator shapes a world for us as the structure&rsquo;s
users, and our appreciation of that world requires our entry into, and
movement through, it. As typical of his emphasis on value-ladenness,
Gadamer takes as central to an architectural object that it has some
form of significance for its environment. Shaping the environment is
normatively part of a design solution to core architectural problems
of function and context. For a building to even count as an
architectural object it needs to address its context. </p>

<p><em>Post-Structuralism</em>. Some architectural theory of the late
twentieth century embraced one or another form of post-structuralist
Continental thought&mdash;one central claim of which is that texts and
other cultural artifacts have meanings and references beyond their
<em>prima facie</em> content. Moreover, meanings and references are
typically taken as fixed not by their creators but according to
background contexts and political agendas. In this vein, Foucault
(1975) has been taken to suggest two claims about
architecture. First, architecture can be an instrument of power and
suppression&mdash;as in the design of prisons, a premier example being
Bentham&rsquo;s Panopticon (1787). Second, while architecture
represents a means of exercising social control, architects themselves
are not, <em>qua</em> individuals, capable of exercising such control
alone and are instead part of a larger network and infrastructure
dedicated to the maintenance and exercise of power.</p>

<h2><a id="AnaTraGooScrBey">5. The Analytic Tradition: Goodman, Scruton, and Beyond</a></h2>

<p>There is perhaps no precise birth moment of analytic
aesthetics&rsquo; engagement with architecture. There are early
starts. Langer (1953) weaves architecture into her broader theory of
symbolic form; to accommodate architecture as an expressive, abstract
art, despite its representational moments, she highlights its capacity
to shape space in virtue of relations among constituent forms and so
(abstractly) express motion or feeling. Beardsley (1958/1981) offers a
brief attempt to account for architecture in his ontology of artifacts
and productions&mdash;plans representing the former, built structures
the latter.</p>

<p>Two entries from Goodman signal more dedicated attention. The
first, perhaps more significant, is his <em>Languages of Art</em>
(1968) account of architecture&rsquo;s ontological classification by
dint of the nature of its notational systems (see chapter 4). In a
second look at language-like phenomena (1985), Goodman proposes that
architectural objects function symbolically in three ways: (1)
<em>denotation</em>, or picking out a relevantly similar
feature&mdash;generally, a shape&mdash;to which the spectator will be
likely to have a present notion; (2) <em>exemplification</em>, or
(literal) highlighting in design of a broader feature of the built
structure; and (3) <em>expression</em>, or metaphorical
exemplification of a feature which, while perhaps broadly
characteristic of the built structure, is not literally so. The first
mode is a standard sort of denotation; the latter two aren&rsquo;t
clearly denotation at all, except in Goodman&rsquo;s broad symbolic
functioning sense. So we may ask if there are specifically
<em>language</em>-like phenomena going on in such cases. A further
question, from an empirical standpoint, is whether we could test for
Goodmanian denotation as might characterize, among architectural
objects, successful symbolic functioning across persons.</p>

<p>The most significant entry in philosophy of
architecture&mdash;certainly within the analytic tradition but
conceivably as a whole&mdash;is Scruton&rsquo;s sprawling, fecund
<em>Aesthetics of Architecture</em> (1979/2013). As in his broader
aesthetics, Scruton highlights the central role of the imagination in
perception and, as joined with our reasoning, in aesthetic
judgment. In loosely Kantian fashion, he proposes that our capacity to
create and see architectural beauty through aesthetic judgment is
integral to the practical reasoning employed in architecture and in
related applied or decorative arts.  Architectural beauty, following
Alberti (1485),
consists in harmony (<em>concinnitas</em>) in composition of parts
(which Alberti defines formally relative to number, position, and
&ldquo;outline&rdquo;). An architectural object succeeds
aesthetically, then, when its parts form a harmonious whole&mdash;and
we gauge such success through imaginatively perceiving as much.</p>

<p>As informed by the imagination, architectural judgment issues in
the exercise of taste&mdash;a critical discrimination to which we
attach aspirations of objectivity&mdash;deployed to identify the
&ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; in style, scale, or arrangement.
Appropriateness&mdash;another notion borrowed from
Alberti&mdash;consists in the ways an architectural objects&rsquo;
constituent parts present, visually, a kind of mutually supportive
warrant. This, for Scruton, is what it means for parts to be
proportional (compare Suppes 1991; De Clercq 2009; Matravers
1999).</p>

<p>If the exercise of taste indicates values embedded in or pertinent
to our experience of architecture, an extension into the moral sphere
demands that we cherish and seek to promote beauty and other aesthetic
values not merely for ourselves but as well for others. Thus
(following Kant further), our embrace of aesthetic values is bound up
with our enriching relations with others; in an architectural context
this means that our aesthetic sensibilities should be oriented towards
creating inviting built environments. Here and in a subsequent polemic
(1994) Scruton, on behalf of classical architecture and in opposition
to modern architecture (and successor movements and styles),
challenges stylistic or critical commitments that do not embrace as
central the production of beauty, harmony, and
&ldquo;appropriateness&rdquo;.</p>

<p><em>Recent Developments.</em> Newer work in philosophy of
architecture reflects greater awareness of, and interaction with,
contributions of architects and architectural theorists. It also
reflects the emergence of architecture as a discrete focus of
aesthetics and other art-centered investigations, with connections to
yet other areas in philosophy. Development as a subdomain is marked by
keen interest in defining bounds of architectural practice and
creation.</p>

<p>For Graham (2012), the central problem of architectural aesthetics
is to account for architectural meaning and value while embracing a
synthesis of <em>artistic</em> value and <em>utility</em>
(&ldquo;engineering&rdquo;) value. This integration is characteristic
of the way architects see their task and the way we engage with
architectural objects. Graham proposes that our optimal engagement
with architecture consists in &ldquo;appropriation&rdquo; rather than
simple appreciation; we imagine our use of the built structure given
its aesthetic and other merits.</p>

<p>Beyond the core foci of aesthetics, contemporary philosophy of
architecture touches on issues raised by aesthetics of the everyday
(see discussion of functional beauty, <a href="index-2.html#AntForFunBea">Philosophy of Architecture: &sect;5.2</a>) and philosophy of the environment. In this last regard, environmental aesthetics (Carlson
1999, 2000; Parsons 2008; Berleant 2007) offers a range of insights
into architecture, together with the urban context, considered as the
<em>built</em> environment. For one, we may take aesthetic
appreciation to be at least partially consistent across kinds of
environments, whether built or otherwise. Then a corresponding
aesthetic criterion for what counts as architecture&mdash;not hitched
to high art&mdash;licenses an inclusivist or expansive picture of what
objects are architectural. For another, environmental aesthetics
recognizes the possibility of engaged and disinterested experience and
appreciation. By contrast, in architectural aesthetics, the default
mode of experience and appreciation is an engaged stance, as a
consequence of the premium on functionality in architecture. Yet there
also may be a disinterested mode of appreciation, augmented with
distance (personal, cultural, or otherwise) from functionality of the
architectural object. Similarly, our appreciation of the built
environment is, like that of environments more generally, informed by
considerations of both cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions. In
keeping with the intentional character of the built environment, the
base case may well be that our appreciation of built structures is
advanced by knowledge of, for example, what purpose they serve.
However, we also appreciate built structures further through immersive
and tactile experience of them.</p>

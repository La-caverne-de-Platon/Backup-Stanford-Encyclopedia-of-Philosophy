<h2>B. Carnap versus Quine on the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction</h2>

<p>
In much of his writing, Carnap followed the philosophical tradition in
speaking of (true) statements as being either analytic&mdash;true by
convention or based on meaning alone&mdash;or synthetic, that is, not
analytic. Of the &ldquo;Two dogmas of empiricism&rdquo; which Quine
(1951) undertook to refute (in what must be one of most-cited papers
in all philosophy during the past century), the first dogma concerned
this <em>analytic-synthetic distinction</em>, and it is certainly the
one that has stuck in people&rsquo;s minds and in the collective
memory of analytic philosophy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
for all its a priori reasonableness, a boundary between analytic and
synthetic statement has not been drawn. That there is such a
distinction to be drawn at all is an un-empirical dogma of
empiricists. (Quine 1951: 34)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even now, despite the growing consensus (see, e.g., Creath 1990, 2007)
that Carnap and Quine were, to some extent, talking past each other,
Quine&rsquo;s critique is viewed as a turning point. The controversy
over analyticity continues to generate a flood of commentary, and the
literature is by now impossible to summarize completely. (For a
discussion of Quine&rsquo;s criticism of the <em>second</em>
&ldquo;reductionist&rdquo; dogma of empiricism, see supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html#QuinCritConsSpacLimiDefi"><em>Aufbau</em> (Section 4)</a>
 and
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#QuinCritCarnReduVeriTheoMean">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 1)</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
In order to assess Quine&rsquo;s criticism of the analytic-synthetic
distinction insofar as it applies to Carnap, it is useful to
distinguish between:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exA1">(A1)</dt>
<dd>the analytic-synthetic distinction for <em>existing natural or
scientific languages</em>,</dd>
<dt id="exA2">(A2)</dt>
<dd> the analytic-synthetic distinction for <em>arbitrary constructed
(artificial) languages</em> (Quine&rsquo;s
&ldquo;&lsquo;analytic-for-<i>L</i>&rsquo; with <em>variable</em>
&lsquo;<i>L</i>&rsquo;&rdquo; (1951: 32)), and</dd>
<dt id="exA3">(A3)</dt>
<dd> the analytic-synthetic distinction for <em>specific constructed
(artificial) languages</em> (&lsquo;analytic-for-<i>L</i>&rsquo; with
<em>fixed</em> &lsquo;<i>L</i>&rsquo;).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The difference is that in (A2) and (A3) the analytic-synthetic
distinction may be determined in and by the construction of a
framework, while in (A1) it ought to reflect a feature of an already
existing language. In the special case in which a particular
artificial language is put forward as a rational reconstruction of a
particular fragment of a natural or scientific language, and where the
analytic-synthetic distinction for the artificial language is also
presented as rationally reconstructing the analytic-synthetic
distinction for the given fragment, (A1) and (A3) are concerned
simultaneously. As we will see, Quine&rsquo;s criticism in &ldquo;Two
Dogmas&rdquo; is about (A1) and (A2), while the thrust of
Carnap&rsquo;s own considerations on analyticity concerns specific
artificial linguistic frameworks and hence (A3). We will now discuss
(A1), (A2), and (A3) one by one.</p>

<p>
With respect to
 <a href="#exA1">(A1)</a>,
 Quine&rsquo;s criticism does have bite, at least <em>prima
facie</em>. As he argues in his &ldquo;Two Dogmas&rdquo;, many of the
typical characterizations of analyticity for natural or scientific
language in the relevant literature seem to presuppose concepts that
are just as much in need of clarification as analyticity itself (e.g.,
synonymy or intension) or which are even explained in terms of
analyticity itself and hence cannot deliver a non-circular definition
of analyticity. He concludes that the whole distinction between
analytic and synthetic statements is unclear. (Though Quine (1951:
&sect;2) accepts the relation of synonymy that is given by explicitly
stated stipulative definitions within a concrete mathematical or
scientific theory; see Ebbs 2017, Chapter 6 for a discussion.)</p>

<p>
Of course, this criticism leaves open whether perhaps the whole
<em>network</em> of &ldquo;intensional notions&rdquo; may be explained
in one fell swoop. Indeed, quite a few modern philosophers who do use
some of these notions in their work seem to think they are clear
enough at least for their own purposes. Also, the analysis of
analyticity as applied to natural languages has been refined in
various ways since Quine: e.g., Boghossian (1996) distinguishes
between epistemic and metaphysical analyticity&mdash;where a sentence
is epistemically analytic just in case &ldquo;the grasp of its meaning
alone suffices for justified belief in its truth&rdquo; (Boghossian
1996: 363)&mdash;and while he dismisses metaphysical analyticity, he
regards epistemic analyticity as philosophically viable. (Carnap 1952a
[1956b: 222], alluded to epistemic analyticity in that sense when he
characterized analytic statements in natural language as those for
which &ldquo;it is sufficient to understand the statement in order to
establish its truth&rdquo;.) Gillian Russell (2008) presents a theory
of a metaphysical notion of analyticity for natural language that does
not seem to be affected by Quine&rsquo;s or Boghossian&rsquo;s
worries: there are sentences, she argues, the meaning of which
<em>fully determines</em> them to be true without <em>making</em> true
what they say (much as \(x = 0\) fully determines the value of \(x
\times y\), where <i>x</i> is analogous to the contribution of meaning
and <i>y</i> to the contribution of the world to the truth value of a
sentence). Moreover, intensional semantics, which originated with
Carnap&rsquo;s work (see the supplement on
 <a href="semantics.html">Semantics</a>),
 and which offers a notion of synonymy (co-intensionality) and a
semantics for intensional operators and contexts, has become highly
influential not just in philosophy but also in linguistics and hence
in scientific research (a fact that ought to be especially relevant to
naturalists such as Quine). (But see, e.g., Pietroski 2018 for an
account of natural language semantics that steers clear of extensional
or intensional semantics.) Yet others drive a wedge between different
intensional notions, agreeing to the general importance of some of
them but denying the philosophical importance of others (e.g., T.
Williamson 2007, who regards synonymy but not analyticity as
philosophically important). In short: the status of
 <a href="#exA1">(A1)</a>
 is still a matter of ongoing philosophical dispute and research. In
later work, Quine (1974) himself suggested an operationalization of
analyticity along the lines of a sentence being analytic &ldquo;if
everybody learns that it is true by learning its words&rdquo; (1974:
79), however he also argues that according to his criterion, e.g.,
mathematics would not count as analytic. Quine&rsquo;s last monograph
(Quine 1995) acknowledged the concept of analyticity if applied to
&ldquo;observation categoricals&rdquo; in natural language (that is,
simple compounds of observation sentences), though Quine continued to
doubt &ldquo;the significance of the analytic-synthetic distinction
when applied to theoretical sentences across the board&rdquo; (Quine
1995: 45), especially, the <em>epistemological</em> significance of
the notion of analyticity.</p>

<p>
Whatever its status, for our purposes it is much more relevant that
 <a href="#exA1">(A1)</a>
 is in fact <em>not what Carnap himself was primarily interested
in</em>. His focus was on
 <a href="#exA3">(A3)</a>
 and, to much lesser extent, on
 <a href="#exA2">(A2)</a>.
 It is true that Carnap does make the connection to the Kantian
terminology of analytic versus synthetic judgments (see, e.g.,
&sect;106 of the <em>Aufbau</em>), which of course did not concern
formal languages; and he was equally impressed by Frege&rsquo;s take
on analyticity for ideal languages (see, e.g., <em>LSS</em>: &sect;14)
and by what seem to be conventional components of actual scientific
theories (such as conventional aspects of geometry, as highlighted by
Poincar&eacute;, or of Einstein&rsquo;s relativity theory; see Part 1
of Friedman 1999 and Chapters 2 and 3 of Ben-Menahem 2006 for a
summary and evaluation). But almost all of Carnap&rsquo;s <em>own</em>
work on analyticity pertains to analyticity in artificially
constructed <em>formal frameworks</em> (compare the
 <a href="index-2.html#Fram">main entry (Section 1.2)</a>).
 For Carnap, analyticity is not <em>forced</em> on us by anything,
certainly not by &ldquo;the facts&rdquo;, let alone anything
ineluctable about the nature of representation, along the lines of
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s <em>Tractatus</em>&mdash;it is a <em>choice</em>.
Carnap&rsquo;s attitude towards analyticity is much like that of
mathematicians towards definitions: in one presentation of the
calculus, functions on real numbers may be defined as continuous based
on the so-called epsilon-delta condition, followed by a theorem which
shows the equivalence of continuity in that sense with a condition
specifying the preservation of limits of real number sequences. But in
another presentation of analysis, the roles of the defining condition
of continuity and its provably equivalent condition might be reversed,
with continuity defined by the preservation of limits. In short:
mathematical definitions are a matter of &ldquo;theory
construction&rdquo;. Similarly, analyticity is a matter of
<em>framework construction</em> for Carnap. For the same reason, when
Quine and Putnam (see, e.g., Putnam 1975) hold that logical systems
and definitions are revisable in the course of scientific development,
Carnap would simply have agreed&mdash;merely adding that (once
rationally reconstructed) such revisions should count as revisions of
the underlying framework. Additionally, he also thought the choice
between constructed languages with and without an analytic-synthetic
distinction was normally a no-brainer, simply because the distinction
was useful&mdash;so obviously useful, in fact, that he never really
bothered to make an explicit case for it.</p>

<p>
From the <em>Logical Syntax</em>, at the latest, Carnap distinguished
very clearly and explicitly between theoretical questions regarding
&ldquo;given&rdquo; languages and practical questions regarding
&ldquo;constructed&rdquo; languages (see, e.g., &ldquo;Testability and
Meaning&rdquo; [TM2: 3], &ldquo;Meaning Postulates&rdquo; [1952a: 66],
and &ldquo;Empiricism, Semantics and Ontology&rdquo; [1950a]). In the
only article in which he considers analyticity for non-constructed
languages in more detail at all (&ldquo;Meaning and Synonymy in
Natural Languages&rdquo; [1955b]), he contrasts analyticity for
natural languages, which he calls a &ldquo;pragmatic concept&rdquo;,
with analyticity for formal languages, which he regards as belonging
to pure semantics and which, he says, constitutes the target of his
logical work:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Nobody doubts that the pragmatical investigation of natural languages
is of greatest importance for an understanding both of the behavior of
individuals and of the character and development of whole cultures. On
the other hand, I believe with the majority of logicians today that
for the special purpose of the development of logic the construction
and semantical investigation of language systems is more important.
(Carnap 1955b: 34)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the same article, Carnap acknowledges that what he calls the
pragmatic notion of analyticity for natural language may serve as an
<em>explicandum</em> which, if things go well, may be explicated
through the semantic concept of analyticity for a formal language.
(Similarly, in &sect;2 of <em>Meaning and Necessity</em> [1947], he
presents <i>L</i>-truth, that is, the notion of logical truth which he
defines explicitly&mdash;see the supplement on
 <a href="semantics.html">Semantics</a>&mdash;as
 explicating the notion of analytic truth in the philosophical
tradition.) Carnap takes Quine&rsquo;s criticism in &ldquo;Two
Dogmas&rdquo; as concerning just the pragmatic concept, that is, the
explicandum of any such explication:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Quine&rsquo;s criticism does not concern the formal correctness of the
definitions in pure semantics; rather, he doubts whether there are any
clear and fruitful corresponding pragmatical concepts which could
serve as explicanda. That is the reason why he demands that these
pragmatical concepts be shown to be scientifically legitimate by
stating empirical, behavioristic criteria for them. If I understand
him correctly, he believes that, without this pragmatical
substructure, the semantical intension concepts, even if formally
correct, are arbitrary and without purpose. I do not think that a
semantical concept, in order to be fruitful, must necessarily possess
a prior pragmatical counterpart. It is theoretically possible to
demonstrate its fruitfulness through its application in the further
development of language systems. But this is a slow process. If for a
given semantical concept there is already a familiar, though somewhat
vague, corresponding pragmatical concept and if we are able to clarify
the latter by describing an operational procedure for its application,
then this may indeed be a simpler way for refuting the objections and
furnish a practical justification at once for both concepts. (Carnap
1955b: 35)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Carnap makes two points in this passage: first, the semantic concept
of analyticity may well be fruitful for the development of artificial
linguistic frameworks without being an explicatum of any prior
explicandum (pragmatic concept of analyticity); we address this below
when we consider
 <a href="#exA2">(A2)</a>
 and
 <a href="#exA3">(A3)</a>.
 Secondly, if a pragmatic concept of analyticity (a natural-language
explicandum) <em>can</em> be identified or operationalized in
empirical terms, this will add to the overall fruitfulness of
<em>both</em> concepts. In &ldquo;Meaning and Synonymy in Natural
Languages&rdquo; (1955b), Carnap suggests such an operationalization
of analyticity for natural languages which he thinks may be carried
out by ascribing intensions to natural language sentences based on
empirical hypotheses about linguistic behavior. These hypotheses could
be tested empirically, e.g., by eliciting judgments of competent
speakers regarding hypothetical (&ldquo;possible&rdquo;) situations as
indicated by their responses to certain descriptions, stories, or
pictures. Once intensions have been assigned by this procedure, two
linguistic expressions can be defined as synonymous in language
<i>L</i> for speaker <i>X</i> at time <i>t</i> just in case they have
the same intension in <i>L</i> for <i>X</i> at <i>t</i>. Finally, a
declarative sentence may be defined as analytic in <i>L</i> for
<i>X</i> at <i>t</i> if and only if its intension in <i>L</i> for
<i>X</i> at <i>t</i> includes all possible cases. (Carnap even wonders
how the intension of a predicate might be determined for a
<em>robot</em>, e.g., by studying the internal functional architecture
of the robot.) For these reasons, Carnap does not regard the notion of
analyticity for natural languages to be hopeless at all, even though
it does not constitute the focus of his own research. (Recently,
Chalmers 2012 proposed a refinement of Carnap&rsquo;s method of
determining intensions for sentences in natural language.)</p>

<p>
We now turn to analyticity and syntheticity for constructed languages,
that is, to
 <a href="#exA2">(A2)</a>
 and
 <a href="#exA3">(A3)</a>
 above. As already explained, Carnap used an analytic-synthetic
distinction almost exclusively in the context of formal languages that
he had constructed himself. In his &ldquo;Truth by Convention&rdquo;
(1936), Quine had argued that one needs at least an implicit
understanding of rules and rule application to be able to determine
and apply the explicit rule systems of artificial languages and
logics&mdash;which Carnap would not have denied. (For more on Carnap
and Quine on truth by convention, see Creath 1987 and Ebbs 2017,
Chapter 3. From different angles, both argue convincingly that (i)
Carnap was not a conventionalist about logic in the metaphysical sense
that accepting logical or semantic rules would somehow <em>make</em>
certain statements <em>true</em>, and (ii) Quine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Truth
by Convention&rdquo; did not aim to discredit a truth-by-convention
thesis to which Carnap himself was committed.) Carnap simply regarded
the analytic-synthetic distinction as a conceptual <em>tool</em> whose
purpose was to facilitate the investigation and application of
constructed languages. In order for this tool to be useful, the
concept of analyticity would not even have to explicate the prior
explicandum of analyticity as applied to natural language (though this
might add to its utility). From this point of view, it is hard to see
what &ldquo;problem of explicating analyticity&rdquo; (Quine 1951: 34)
might remain that could be relevant to (A2) and (A3). At worst, it
seems, someone might put forward a <em>formally</em> incorrect
definition of analyticity for some artificial language; or, while
formally correct, a definition that would not turn out to be
particularly useful for its intended purposes. Do such worries apply
to Carnap&rsquo;s conception of analyticity for <em>constructed
languages?</em></p>

<p>
Here the difference between
 <a href="#exA2">(A2)</a>
 and
 <a href="#exA3">(A3)</a>
 becomes salient: (A2) requires a definition of
&ldquo;analytic-for-<i>L</i>&rdquo; for <em>variable</em> <i>L</i>,
that is, a definition that applies to a whole class of linguistic
frameworks simultaneously. Although Carnap indicates in part IV of his
<em>Logical Syntax</em> (on general syntax) that such a general
definition of analyticity might eventually be possible (see the
supplement on
 <a href="syntax.html"><em>Logical Syntax of Language</em></a>)&mdash;a
 promise reiterated in the <em>Introduction to Semantics</em> (Carnap
1942: 59&ndash;60)&mdash;by 1950 he came to realize that these
suggestions had been rash. Carnap did not actually manage to supply
any such general definition of analyticity for all, or even of a
subclass of, formal languages, which confirms Quine&rsquo;s worries
about (A2) in his &ldquo;Two Dogmas&rdquo;. As Quine there maintains,
Carnap did not &ldquo;explain the idiom &lsquo;<i>S</i> is analytic
for <i>L</i>&rsquo; with variable &lsquo;<i>S</i>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<i>L</i>&rsquo;, even though&rdquo;, as Quine acknowledges,
&ldquo;we be content to limit the range of &lsquo;<i>L</i>&rsquo; to
the realm of artificial languages&rdquo; (1951: 32).</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it is <em>not</em> clear at all why failing to give
a general definition of analyticity&mdash;as required by (A2)
above&mdash;would impair any of the work that analyticity actually did
for Carnap, which was essentially confined to (A3). Consider this
analogy (due to David 1996): while Tarski (1933 [1935]) also did not
give us a definition of &lsquo;true-in-<i>L</i>&rsquo; for variable
&lsquo;<i>L</i>&rsquo;, he did construct a canonical example of such a
definition for a non-trivial formalized language, and the
truth-theoretic methods he developed still turned out to be extremely
useful for the study and application of &lsquo;true-in-<i>L</i>&rsquo;
for a great variety of concrete languages <i>L</i>. Why should the
standards for analyticity and analyticity-theoretic methods be
higher?</p>

<p>
Indeed, (A3) seems unaffected by any of Quine&rsquo;s worries: Carnap
<em>did</em> deliver precise and formally correct definitions of
analyticity for pretty much every single linguistic framework he
constructed in his work.</p>

<p>
In the <em>Aufbau</em>, for instance, Carnap defines as analytic those
formulas in the language of his phenomenalist constitution system that
can be derived logically from the explicitly stated set of definitions
in the system. (For example, the symmetry of Carnap&rsquo;s binary
similarity relation <i>Ae</i> is analytic in that sense, since it
follows logically from the definition of &lsquo;<i>Ae</i>&rsquo;: see
&sect;114 in the <em>Aufbau</em>, and see supplements on
 <a href="methodology.html#RatiReco">Methodology (Section 3)</a>
 and
 <a href="aufbau.html"><em>Aufbau</em> (Section 2)</a>
 for the background.)</p>

<p>
How the analyticity of sentences in Languages I and II is defined in
the <em>Logical Syntax</em> is explained in detail in the supplement
on
 <a href="syntax.html"><em>Logical Syntax of Language</em></a>.
 A sentence is defined as synthetic if and only if it is neither
analytic nor contradictory. For instance, based on these definitions,
the principle of complete induction turns out to be analytic in
Language II (LSS: &sect;34h). (As Mac Lane [1938: 172] points out in
his review of the <em>Logical Syntax</em>, this relies on assuming
complete induction in the metalinguistic syntax theory&mdash;just as
modern logic textbooks prove all formalized object language instances
of the law of excluded middle to be logically true by assuming
metalinguistic instances of the law of excluded middle in their
mathematical background theory. In neither case is this circular in
any vicious sense.) Carnap shows that every purely logical sentence is
either analytic or contradictory; he defines the content (sense) of a
sentence to be the set of synthetic sentences that are its
consequences, and he proves the indefinability of
analyticity-in-Language-I/II <em>in</em> Language I/II, respectively
(LSS: &sect;60c), on G&ouml;delian grounds. In &sect;25 he points out
that, e.g., a syntactic sentence such as &ldquo;an occurrence of zero
is not an occurrence of an existential quantifier&rdquo; is synthetic
in &ldquo;axiomatic syntax&rdquo; (before arithmetization), while it
is analytic after arithmetization (in &ldquo;arithmetical
syntax&rdquo;). Once again, analyticity is language-relative. While
the analyticity of a sentence only guarantees its consistency
<em>given the consistency of the underlying framework</em> (as
emphasized by G&ouml;del, see the supplement on
 <a href="tolerance-metaphysics.html#ToleLogiSynt">Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology (Section 1)</a>),
 this is unproblematic for Carnap&rsquo;s purposes: for him, the
&ldquo;justification&rdquo; of determining certain statements to be
analytic in a linguistic framework is just as pragmatic as the
&ldquo;justification&rdquo; of the construction of the framework to
which they belong.</p>

<p>
In later works, e.g., in <em>Meaning and Necessity</em> and
<em>Logical Foundations of Probability</em>, Carnap defines
analyticity-in-<i>L</i> as simply coinciding with logical truth. In
<em>Testability and Meaning</em>, every sentence <i>A</i> is assigned
a so-called representative sentence (expressing the factual content of
<i>A</i>), such that <i>A</i> is defined as analytic just in case the
derivability of its representative sentence in the framework is
invariant under substitutions of descriptive terms. In Chapter 27 of
<em>Philosophical Foundations of Physics</em> (Carnap 1966),
analyticity for artificial observational languages is reconstructed as
follows: a sentence is analytic in the observation language just in
case it(s truth) is logically entailed by the semantic designation
rules or by the meaning postulates (&ldquo;A-postulates&rdquo;,
analyticity postulates) that are stated explicitly as axioms in a
framework (such as, e.g., a formalization of &ldquo;All birds are
animals&rdquo;) and which are supposed to constrain the interpretation
of terms without telling us anything &ldquo;about the actual
world&rdquo; (Carnap 1966: 263). (The method of defining analyticity
from explicitly stated meaning postulates had been introduced in
Carnap 1952a in a semantic framework similar to that of <em>Meaning
and Necessity</em>. Richard Montague and Barbara Partee used variants
of Carnapian meaning postulates later in intensional semantics for
natural language; see Partee 1975.) Last but not least, in Chapter 28
of <em>Philosophical Foundations of Physics</em>, Carnap (1966)
describes a uniform method by which the analytic part of a scientific
theory can be reconstructed as a single higher-order meaning postulate
(the Carnap sentence of the theory); we explain in detail how this
works in the supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 4)</a>.
 In that context, analytic sentences are the sentences logically
implied by that analytic part of the theory (together perhaps with
meaning postulates for observation terms).</p>

<p>
The upshot is that the exact details of how analyticity is defined in
any particular Carnapian framework very much depends on the purposes
of the framework in question. What all these definitions have in
common, however, is that analyticity is not just defined in clear and
precise terms, and that the resulting concept is applied successfully
in the exposition and application of their underlying frameworks, but
also, given Carnap&rsquo;s own aims (though not Quine&rsquo;s!), the
concept always seems to have more or less <em>the same functional
role</em> to play&mdash;to keep track of those statements in a
linguistic framework that &ldquo;come with&rdquo; the framework, that
express the framework&rsquo;s own resources, that are presupposed in
the framework, and which do not have any empirical content on their
own. That is why Friedman (2001) suggests that the Carnapian
conception of <em>analyticity in a framework</em> may serve to
explicate what Friedman (1999) (based on Reichenbach 1920) calls
<em>relative</em> or <em>constitutive aprioricity</em>: the relational
property of sentences <em>being presupposed by, and enabling, the
formulation, truth-conditionality and empirical justification of
scientific hypotheses belonging to a joint scientific paradigm</em>.
For instance, in an example from physics, Friedman (2001) argues that
the calculus of real numbers and Newton&rsquo;s Laws of Motion is a
priori <em>relative to</em> Newton&rsquo;s law of gravitation since
the law of gravitation could neither be formulated nor tested without
presupposing the necessary mathematical resources or the laws of
motion. Once equipped with a suitable logic, semantics, a confirmation
function (or a class of such functions), <em>and a set of analytic
statements</em>, a Carnapian linguistic framework may serve as a
rational reconstruction of a Kuhnian paradigm or disciplinary matrix,
such as the Newtonian paradigm in physics: the stable backdrop against
which empirical hypotheses in the framework (such as, e.g.,
Newton&rsquo;s gravitational law) can be expressed and tested. While
these empirical hypotheses are reconstructed as synthetic statements
in a framework, the analytic statements in a framework reconstruct
those scientific statements that are presupposed by all empirical
applications of the scientific paradigm whatsoever but which do not
have empirical consequences on their own: such analytic statements
include logical laws, purely mathematical laws, stipulative
definitions, or the &ldquo;holistically&rdquo; determined analytic
parts of scientific theories in Carnap (1966) which Carnap shows do
not logically imply any statements in the observational sublanguage
except for logically true ones (see supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 4)</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Finally, normal science in Kuhn&rsquo;s (1962) sense may be
reconstructed as proceeding by the revision of the empirical
hypotheses <em>within</em> a linguistic framework, while paradigm
shifts at revolutionary stages of science can be reconstructed as
transitions from one linguistic framework <em>to</em> another, such as
from the Newtonian framework to a relativistic one. See Friedman
(2001) for details. (There is in fact a slight mismatch between
Friedman&rsquo;s proposal to view the Newtonian laws of motion as
constitutive of the Newtonian paradigm and his proposal to think of
analytic statements in a suitable Carnapian framework as
reconstructing such constitutive laws: for the conjunction of the
Newtonian laws of motion, unlike analytic statements in Carnap&rsquo;s
sense, can be shown to have weak empirical consequences [Stein 1998].
This mismatch can be repaired, however, by replacing the Newtonian
laws of motion in Friedman&rsquo;s argument by the definitional
clauses of what is called a &ldquo;classical particle mechanics&rdquo;
by Sneed [1971], which do not have any empirical consequences; see
Sneed 1971: 118.) There are even places where Carnap appears to
acknowledge incommensurability of exactly the kind Kuhn discusses;
see, e.g., Carnap&rsquo;s &ldquo;Truth and Confirmation&rdquo; (1936
[1949: 126]): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In translating one language into another the factual content of an
empirical statement cannot always be preserved unchanged. Such changes
are inevitable if the structures of the two languages differ in
essential points. For example: while many statements of modern physics
are completely translatable into statements of classical physics, this
is not so or only incompletely so with other statements. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Differences between the sets of analytic statements of two frameworks
can make such conceptual differences between frameworks visible.</p>

<p>
It follows that if Kuhn&rsquo;s paradigm-vs.-theory distinction in
science make sense at all, and if Friedman is right about Carnapian
frameworks being successful rational reconstructions of Kuhnian
paradigms, then, at least concerning these uses of frameworks, the
distinction between the analytic statements that are stipulated as
part of a framework and the synthetic empirical hypotheses that
presuppose a framework is not arbitrary and explicates an existing and
useful distinction in the methodology of science. This would address
Quine&rsquo;s concern in &ldquo;Carnap and Logical Truth&rdquo; in
which he worried that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Legislative acts occur again and again; on the other hand a dichotomy
of the resulting truths themselves into analytic and synthetic, truth
by meaning postulate and truths by force of nature, has been given no
tolerably clear meaning even as a methodological ideal. (Quine 1960b:
Section 10)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Summing up: Quine&rsquo;s criticism of the analytic-synthetic
distinction in his &ldquo;Two Dogmas&rdquo; casts some doubt on the
analytic-synthetic distinction for <em>existing natural languages and
(to some extent) existing scientific languages</em> as well as on
Carnap&rsquo;s occasional early speculations about generalizing the
analytic-synthetic distinction across <em>arbitrary artificial
languages</em>. However, Quine&rsquo;s critique does not undermine
Carnap&rsquo;s definitions and usage of analyticity so far as the
<em>particular constructed linguistic frameworks</em> are concerned
that Carnap constructed and put to use in his own work, especially in
his rational reconstruction of scientific theories&mdash;which was his
main interest (see supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories</a>).</p>
 
<p>
A remaining option for naturalists in the Quinean spirit would be to
criticize Carnap&rsquo;s philosophy by questioning the value of
constructing artificial linguistic frameworks for the rational
reconstruction of science and for the further development of science.
(That is, e.g., Mark Wilson&rsquo;s [2012] criticism of Carnap, and
also Penelope Maddy&rsquo;s in her <em>Second Philosophy</em> [2007:
Ch. 5].) Whether this kind of criticism is justified remains an open
question, as Carnap himself pointed out in the discussion after a
colloquium Quine gave at Chicago in 1951. Howard Stein, who was
present, reports (1992: 279) that Carnap said approximately this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Quine and I really differ, not concerning any matter of fact, nor any
question with cognitive content, but rather in our respective
estimates of the most fruitful course for science to follow. Quine is
impressed by the continuity between scientific thought and that of
daily life&mdash;between scientific language and the language of
ordinary discourse&mdash;and sees no philosophical gain, no gain
either in clarity or fruitfulness, in the construction of distinct
formalized languages for science. I concede the continuity, but, on
the contrary, believe that very important gains in clarity and
fruitfulness are to be had from the introduction of such formally
constructed languages. This is a difference of opinion which, despite
the fact that it does not concern (in my own terms) a matter with
cognitive content, is nonetheless in principle susceptible to a kind
of rational resolution. In my view, both programs&mdash;mine of
formalized languages, Quine&rsquo;s of a more free-flowing and casual
use of language&mdash;ought to be pursued; and I think that if Quine
and I could live, say, for two hundred years, it would be possible by
the end of that time for us to agree on which of the two programs had
proved more successful. (Stein 1992: 279)</p>

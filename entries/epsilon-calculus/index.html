<h1>The Epsilon Calculus</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri May 3, 2002; substantive revision Mon May 6, 2019</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The epsilon calculus is a logical formalism developed by David Hilbert
in the service of his program in the foundations of mathematics. The
epsilon operator is a term-forming operator which replaces quantifiers
in ordinary predicate logic. Specifically, in the calculus, a term
\(\varepsilon x A\) denotes some \(x\) satisfying \(A(x)\), if there
is one. In Hilbert&rsquo;s Program, the epsilon terms play the role of
ideal elements; the aim of Hilbert&rsquo;s finitistic consistency
proofs is to give a procedure which removes such terms from a formal
proof. The procedures by which this is to be carried out are based on
Hilbert&rsquo;s epsilon substitution method. The epsilon calculus,
however, has applications in other contexts as well. The first general
application of the epsilon calculus was in Hilbert&rsquo;s epsilon
theorems, which in turn provide the basis for the first correct proof
of Herbrand&rsquo;s theorem. More recently, variants of the epsilon
operator have been applied in linguistics and linguistic philosophy to
deal with anaphoric pronouns.</p>

<h2 id="Over">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
By the turn of the century David Hilbert and Henri Poincar&eacute;
were recognized as the two most important mathematicians of their
generation. Hilbert&rsquo;s range of mathematical interests was broad,
and included an interest in the foundations of mathematics: his
<em>Foundations of Geometry</em> was published in 1899, and of the
list of questions posed to the International Congress of
Mathematicians in 1900, three addressed distinctly foundational
issues.</p>

<p>
Following the publication of Russell&rsquo;s paradox, Hilbert
presented an address to the Third International Congress of
Mathematicians in 1904, where, for the first time, he sketched his
plan to provide a rigorous foundation for mathematics via syntactic
consistency proofs. But he did not return to the subject in earnest
until 1917, when he began a series of lectures on the foundations of
mathematics with the assistance of Paul Bernays. Although Hilbert was
impressed by the work of Russell and Whitehead in their <em>Principia
Mathematica</em>, he became convinced that the logicist attempt to
reduce mathematics to logic could not succeed, due in particular to
the non-logical character of their axiom of reducibility. At the same
time, he judged the intuitionistic rejection of the law of the
excluded middle as unacceptable to mathematics. Therefore, in order to
counter concerns raised by the discovery of the logical and
set-theoretic paradoxes, a new approach was needed to justify modern
mathematical methods.</p>

<p>
By the summer of 1920, Hilbert had formulated such an approach. First,
modern mathematical methods were to be represented in formal deductive
systems. Second, these formal systems were to be proved syntactically
consistent, not by exhibiting a model or reducing their consistency to
another system, but by a direct metamathematical argument of an
explicit, &ldquo;finitary&rdquo; character. The approach became known
as
 <a href="../hilbert-program/index.html">Hilbert's program</a>.
 The epsilon calculus was to provide the first component of this
program, while his epsilon substitution method was to provide the
second.</p>

<p>
The epsilon calculus is, in its most basic form, an extension of
first-order predicate logic with an &ldquo;epsilon operation&rdquo;
that picks out, for any true existential formula, a witness to the
existential quantifier. The extension is conservative in the sense
that it does not add any new first-order consequences. But,
conversely, quantifiers can be defined in terms of the epsilons, so
first-order logic can be understood in terms of quantifier-free
reasoning involving the epsilon operation. It is this latter feature
that makes the calculus convenient for the purpose of proving
consistency. Suitable extensions of the epsilon calculus make it
possible to embed stronger, quantificational theories of numbers and
sets in quantifier-free calculi. Hilbert expected that it would be
possible to demonstrate the consistency of such extensions.</p>

<h2 id="EpsiCalc">2. The Epsilon Calculus</h2>

<p>
In his Hamburg lecture in 1921 (1922), Hilbert first presented the
idea of using such an operation to deal with the principle of the
excluded middle in a formal system for arithmetic. These ideas were
developed into the epsilon calculus and the epsilon substitution
method in a series of lecture courses between 1921 and 1923, and in
Hilbert&rsquo;s (1923). The final presentation of the epsilon-calculus
can be found in Wilhelm Ackermann&rsquo;s dissertation (1924).</p>

<p>
This section will describe a version of the calculus corresponding to
first-order logic, while extensions to first- and second-order
arithmetic will be described below.</p>

<p>
Let \(L\) be a first-order language, which is to say, a list of
constant, function, and relation symbols with specified arities. The
set of epsilon terms and the set of formulae of \(L\) are defined
inductively, simultaneously, as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>Each constant of \(L\) is a term.</li>

<li>Each variable is a term.</li>

<li>If \(s\) and \(t\) are terms, then \(s = t\) is a formula.</li>

<li>If \(s_1, \ldots, s_k\) are terms and \(F\) is a \(k\)-ary
function symbol of \(L, F(s_1, \ldots, s_k)\) is a term.</li>

<li>If \(s_1, \ldots, s_k\) are terms and \(R\) is a \(k\)-ary
relation symbol of \(L, R(s_1, \ldots, s_k)\) is a formula.</li>

<li>If \(A\) and \(B\) are formulae, so are \(A \wedge B, A \vee B, A
\rightarrow B\), and \(\neg A\).</li>

<li>If \(A\) is a formula and \(x\) is a variable, \(\varepsilon x A\)
is a term.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Substitution and the notions of free and bound variable, are defined
in the usual way; in particular, the variable \(x\) becomes bound in
the term \(\varepsilon x A\). The intended interpretation is that
\(\varepsilon x A\) denotes <em>some</em> \(x\) satisfying \(A\), if
there is one. Thus, the epsilon terms are governed by the following

axiom (Hilbert&rsquo;s &ldquo;transfinite axiom&rdquo;): \[ A(x)
\rightarrow A(\varepsilon x A) \] In addition, the epsilon calculus

 includes a complete set of axioms governing the classical
propositional connectives, and axioms governing the equality symbol.
The only rules of the calculus are the following:</p>

<ul>

<li>Modus ponens</li>

<li>Substitution: from \(A(x)\), conclude \(A(t)\), for any term
\(t.\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Earlier forms of the epsilon calculus (such as that presented in
Hilbert 1923) use a dual form of the epsilon operator, in which
\(\varepsilon x A\) returns a value <em>falsifying</em> \(A(x)\). The
version above was used in Ackermann&rsquo;s dissertation (1924), and
has become standard.</p>

<p>
Note that the calculus just described is quantifier-free. Quantifiers

can be <em>defined</em> as follows: \[ \begin{align} \exists x A(x)
&amp;\equiv A(\varepsilon x A) \\ \forall x A(x) &amp;\equiv
A(\varepsilon x (\neg A)) \end{align} \] The usual quantifier axioms

 and rules can be derived from these, so the definitions
above serve to embed first-order logic in the epsilon calculus. The
converse is, however, not true: not every formula in the epsilon
calculus is the image of an ordinary quantified formula under this
embedding. Hence, the epsilon calculus is more expressive than the
predicate calculus, simply because epsilon terms can be combined in
more complex ways than quantifiers.</p>

<p>
It is worth noting that epsilon terms are nondeterministic. 
For example, in a language
with constant symbols \(a\) and \(b\), \(\varepsilon x (x = a \vee x =
b)\) is either \(a\) or \(b\), but the calculus leaves it entirely
open as to which is the case. One can add to the calculus a schema
of <em>extensionality</em>, \[ \forall x (A(x) \leftrightarrow B(x))
\rightarrow \varepsilon x A = \varepsilon x B \] which asserts that
the epsilon operator assigns the same witness to
equivalent formulae \(A\) and \(B\). For many applications, however,
this additional schema is not necessary.</p>

<h2 id="EpsiTheo">3. The Epsilon Theorems</h2>

<p>
The second volume of Hilbert and Bernays&rsquo; <em>Grundlagen der
Mathematik</em> (1939) provides an account of results on the
epsilon-calculus that had been proved by that time. This includes a
discussion of the first and second epsilon theorems with applications
to first-order logic, the epsilon substitution method for arithmetic
with open induction, and a development of analysis (that is,
second-order arithmetic) with the epsilon calculus.</p>

<p>
The first and second epsilon theorems are as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>First epsilon theorem:</strong> Suppose \(\Gamma \cup \{A\}\)
is a set of quantifier-free formulae not involving the epsilon symbol.
If \(A\) is derivable from \(\Gamma\) in the epsilon calculus, then
\(A\) is derivable from \(\Gamma\) in quantifier-free predicate
logic.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Second epsilon theorem:</strong> Suppose \(\Gamma \cup \{A\}\)
is a set of formulae not involving the epsilon symbol. If \(A\) is
derivable from \(\Gamma\) in the epsilon calculus, then \(A\) is
derivable from \(\Gamma\) in predicate logic.</p>

<p>
In the first epsilon theorem, &ldquo;quantifier-free predicate
logic&rdquo; is intended to include the substitution rule above, so
quantifier-free axioms behave like their universal closures. Since the
epsilon calculus includes first-order logic, the first epsilon theorem
implies that any detour through first-order predicate logic used to
derive a quantifier-free theorem from quantifier-free axioms can
ultimately be avoided. The second epsilon theorem shows that any
detour through the epsilon calculus used to derive a theorem in the
language of the predicate calculus from axioms in the language of the
predicate calculus can also be avoided.</p>

<p>
More generally, the first epsilon theorem establishes that quantifiers
and epsilons can always be eliminated from a proof of a
quantifier-free formula from other quantifier-free formulae. This is
of particular importance for Hilbert&rsquo;s program, since the
epsilons play the role of ideal elements in mathematics. If
quantifier-free formulae correspond to the &ldquo;real&rdquo; part of
the mathematical theory, the first epsilon-theorem shows that ideal
elements can be eliminated from proofs of real statements, provided
the axioms are also real statements.</p>

<p>
This idea is made precise in a certain general consistency theorem
which Hilbert and Bernays derive from the first epsilon-theorem, which
says the following: Let \(F\) be any formal system which results from
the predicate calculus by addition of constant, function, and
predicate symbols plus true axioms which are quantifier- and
epsilon-free, and suppose the truth of atomic formulae in the new
language is decidable. Then \(F\) is consistent in the strong sense
that every derivable quantifier- and epsilon-free formula is true.
Hilbert and Bernays use this theorem to give a finitary consistency
proof of elementary geometry (1939, Sec 1.4).</p>

<p>
The difficulty for giving consistency proofs for arithmetic and
analysis consists in extending this result to cases where the axioms
also contain ideal elements, i.e., epsilon terms.</p>

<p>
<em>Further reading.</em> The original sources on the epsilon-calculus
and the epsilon theorems (Ackermann 1924, Hilbert &amp; Bernays 1939)
remain available only in German. Leisenring 1969 is a relatively
modern book-length introduction to the epsilon calculus in English.
The first and second epsilon theorem are described in detail in Zach
2017. Moser &amp; Zach 2006 give a detailed analysis for the case
without equality. The original proofs are given for axiomatic
presentations of the epsilon-calculus. Maehara 1955 was the first to
consider sequent calculus with epsilon terms. He showed how to prove
the second epsilon theorem using cut elimination, and then
strengthened the theorem to include the schema of extensionality
(Maehara 1957). Baaz et al. 2018 give an improved version of the first
epsilon theorem. Corrections to errors in the literature (including
Leisenring&rsquo;s book) can be found in Flannagan 1975; Ferrari 1987;
and Yasuhara 1982. A variation of the epsilon calculus based on Skolem
functions, and therefore compatible with first-order logic, is
discussed in Davis &amp; Fechter 1991.</p>

<h2 id="HerbTheo">4. Herbrand&rsquo;s Theorem</h2>

<p>
Hilbert and Bernays used the methods of the epsilon calculus to
establish theorems about first order logic that make no reference to
the epsilon calculus itself. One such example is <em>Herbrand&rsquo;s
theorem</em> (Herbrand 1930; see Buss 1995, Girard 1982, and section
2.5 of Buss 1998). This is often formulated as the statement that if

an existential formula \[ \exists x_1 \ldots \exists x_k A(x_1,
\ldots, x_k) \] is derivable in first-order predicate logic (without

 equality), where \(A\) is quantifier-free, then there are
sequences of terms \(t_{1}^1, \ldots, t_{k}^1, \ldots, t_{1}^n,
\ldots, t_k ^n\), 

such that \[ A(t_{1}^1, \ldots, t_k ^1) \vee \ldots \vee A(t_{1}^n,
\ldots, t_k^n) \] is a tautology. If one is dealing with first-order

 logic <em>with</em> equality, one has to
replace &ldquo;tautology&rdquo; by &ldquo;tautological consequence of
substitution instances of the equality axioms&rdquo;; we will use the
term &ldquo;quasi-tautology&rdquo; to describe such a formula.</p>

<p>
The version of Herbrand&rsquo;s theorem just described follows
immediately from the <em>Extended First Epsilon Theorem</em> of
Hilbert and Bernays. Using methods associated with the proof of the
second epsilon theorem, however, Hilbert and Bernays derived a
stronger result that, like Herbrand&rsquo;s original formulation,
provides more information. To understand the two parts of the theorem
below, it helps to consider a particular example. Let \(A\) be the
formula</p> 

\[
\exists x_1 \forall x_2 \exists x_3 \forall x_4 B(x_1, x_2,  x_3, x_4)
\]

 where \(B\) is quantifier-free. The negation
of \(A\) is equivalent to 

\[
\forall x_1 \exists x_2 \forall x_3 \exists x_4 \neg B(x_1, x_2, x _3, x_4).
\]

 By Skolemizing, i.e., using
function symbols to witness the existential quantifiers, we obtain

\[
\exists f_2, f_4 \forall x_1, x_3 \neg B(x_1, f_2 (x_1), x_3, f_4 (x_1, x_3)).
\]

 Taking the negation of this, we see that the original
formula is &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; to 

\[
\forall f_2, f_4 \exists x_1, x_3 B(x_1, f_2 (x_1), x_3, f_4 (x_1, x_3)).
\]

<p>
The first clause of the theorem below, in this particular instance,
says that the formula \(A\) above is derivable in first-order logic if
and only if there is a sequence of terms \(t_{1}^1, t_{3}^1, \ldots,
t_{1}^n, t_{3}^n\) in the expanded language with \(f_2\) and \(f_4\)

such that \[ B(t_{1}^1, f_2 (t_{1}^1), t_{3}^1, f_4 (t_{1}^1,t_{3}^1))
\vee \ldots \vee B(t_{1}^n, f_2 (t_{1}^n), t_{3}^n, f_4
(t_{1}^n,t_{3}^n)) \] is a quasi-tautology.</p>

<p>
The second clause of the theorem below, in this particular instance,
says that the formula \(A\) above is derivable in first-order logic if
and only if there are sequences of variables \(x_{2}^1, x_{4}^1,
\ldots, x_2^n, x_4 ^n\) and terms \(s_{1}^1, s_{3}^1, \ldots, s_1^n,

s_3 ^n\) in the <em>original language</em> such that \[ B(s_{1}^1,
x_{2}^1, s_{3}^1, x_4 ^1 ) \vee \ldots \vee B(s_1^n, x_2^n, s_3^n,
x_4^n ) \] is a quasi-tautology, and such that \(A\) is derivable from

 this formula using only the quantifier and idempotency
rules described below.</p> 

<p> 

More generally, suppose \(A\) is any prenex formula, of the form \[
\mathbf{Q}_1 x_1 \ldots \mathbf{Q}_n x_n B(x_1, \ldots, x_n), \] where

 \(B\) is quantifier-free.
Then \(B\) is said to be the <em>matrix</em> of \(A\), and an
<em>instance of</em> \(B\) is obtained by substituting terms in the
language of \(B\) for some of its variables. The <em>Herbrand normal
form</em> \(A^H\) of \(A\) is obtained by</p>

<ul>

<li>deleting each universal quantifier, and</li>

<li>replacing each universally quantified variable \(x_i\) by \(f_i
(x_{i}^1,\ldots, x_{i}^{k(i)})\), where \(x_{i}^1,\ldots,
x_{i}^{k(i)}\) are the variables corresponding to the existential
quantifiers preceding \(\mathbf{Q}_i\) in \(A\) (in order), and
\(f_i\) is a new function symbol designated for this role.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When we refer to an <em>instance</em> of the matrix of \(A^H\), we
mean a formula that is obtained by substituting terms in the expanded
language in the matrix of \(A^H\). We can now state Hilbert and
Bernays&rsquo;s formulation of</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Herbrand&rsquo;s theorem.</strong> (1) A prenex formula \(A\)
is derivable in the predicate calculus if and only if there is a
disjunction of instances of the matrix of \(A^H\) which is a
quasi-tautology.</p>

<p>
(2) A prenex formula \(A\) is derivable in the predicate calculus if
and only if there is a disjunction \(\bigvee_j B_j\) of instances of
the matrix of \(A\), such that \(\bigvee_j B_j\) is a quasi-tautology,
and \(A\) is derivable from \(\bigvee_j B_j\) using the following
rules:</p>

<ul>

<li>from \(C_1 \vee \ldots \vee C_i (t) \vee \ldots \vee C_m\)
<br />
conclude \(C_1 \vee \ldots \vee \exists x C_i (x) \vee \ldots \vee
C_m\) and</li>

<li>from \(C_1 \vee \ldots \vee C_i (x) \vee \ldots \vee C_m\)
<br />
conclude \(C_1 \vee \ldots \vee \forall xC_i (x) \vee \ldots \vee
C_m\) (if \(x\) not in \(C_j\) for \(j \ne i)\),</li>
</ul>

<p>
as well as the idempotence of \(\vee\) (from \(C \vee C \vee D\)
conclude \(C \vee D)\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Herbrand&rsquo;s theorem can also be obtained by using cut
elimination, via Gentzen&rsquo;s &ldquo;midsequent theorem.&rdquo;
However, the proof using the second epsilon theorem has the
distinction of being the first complete and correct proof of
Herbrand&rsquo;s theorem. Moreover, and this is seldom recognized,
whereas the proof based on cut-elimination provides a bound on the
length of the Herbrand disjunction only as a function of the cut rank
and complexity of the cut formulas in the proof, the length obtained
from the proof based on the epsilon calculus provides a bound as a
function of the number of applications of the transfinite axiom, and
the rank and degree of the epsilon-terms occurring therein. In other
words, the length of the Herbrand disjunction depends only on the
quantificational complexity of the substitutions involved, and, e.g.,
not at all on the propositional structure or the length of the
proof.</p>

<p>
The version of Herbrand&rsquo;s theorem stated at the beginning of
this section is essentially the special case of (2) in which the
formula \(A\) is existential. In light of this special case, (1) is
equivalent to the assertion that a formula \(A\) is derivable in
first-order predicate logic if and only if \(A^H\) is. The forward
direction of this equivalence is much easier to prove; in fact, for
any formula \(A, A \rightarrow A^H\) is derivable in predicate logic.
Proving the reverse direction involves eliminating the additional
function symbols in \(A^H\), and is much more difficult, especially in
the presence of equality. It is here that epsilon methods play a
central role.</p>

<p>
Given a prenex formula, the <em>Skolem normal form</em> \(A^S\) is
defined dually to \(A^H\), i.e., by replacing existentially quantified
variables by witnessing functions. If \(\Gamma\) is a set of prenex
sentences, let \(\Gamma^S\) denote the set of their Skolem normal
forms. Using the deduction theorem and Herbrand&rsquo;s theorem, it is

not hard to show that the following are pairwise equivalent: \[
\begin{align} \Gamma &amp;\text{ proves } A \\ \Gamma &amp;\text{
proves } A^H \\ \Gamma^S &amp;\text{ proves }A \\ \Gamma^S &amp;\text{
proves } A^H \end{align} \]

 </p>

<p>
A striking application of Herbrand's theorem and related methods is
found in Luckhardt's (1989) analysis of Roth's theorem. For a
discussion of useful extensions of Herbrand's methods, see Sieg 1991.
A model-theoretic version of this is discussed in Avigad 2002a.</p>

<h2 id="EpsiSubsMethArit">5. The Epsilon Substitution Method and Arithmetic</h2>

<p>
As noted above, historically, the primary interest in the epsilon
calculus was as a means to obtaining consistency proofs.
Hilbert&rsquo;s lectures from 1917&ndash;1918 already note that one
can easily prove the consistency of propositional logic, by taking
propositional variables and formulae to range over truth values 0 and
1, and interpreting the logical connectives as the corresponding
arithmetic operations. Similarly, one can prove the consistency of
predicate logic (or the pure epsilon calculus), by specializing to
interpretations where the universe of discourse has a single element.
These considerations suggest the following more general program for
proving consistency:</p>

<ul>

<li>Extend the epsilon calculus in such a way as to represent larger
portions of mathematics.</li>

<li>Show, using finitary methods, that each proof in the extended
system has a consistent interpretation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, consider the language of arithmetic, with symbols for
\(0\), \(1\), \(+\), \(\times\), \(\lt\). Along with quantifier-free
axioms defining the basic symbols, one can specify that the epsilon
terms \(\varepsilon x A(x)\) picks out the least value satisfying

\(A\), if there is one, with the following axiom: \[ \tag{*} A(x)
\rightarrow A(\varepsilon x A(x)) \wedge \varepsilon x A(x) \le x \]

 The result is a system that is strong enough to interpret
first-order (Peano) arithmetic. Alternatively, one can take the
epsilon symbol to 

satisfy the following axiom: \[ A(y) \rightarrow A(\varepsilon x A(x))
\wedge \varepsilon x A(x) \ne y + 1.  \]</p>

<p>
In other words, if there is any witness \(y\) satisfying \(A(y)\), the
epsilon term returns a value whose predecessor does not have the same
property. Clearly the epsilon term described by (*) satisfies the
alternative axiom; conversely, one can check that given \(A\), a value
of \(\varepsilon x (\exists z \le x A(x))\) satisfying the alternative
axiom can be used to interpret \(\varepsilon x A(x)\) in (*). One can

further fix the meaning of the epsilon term with the axiom \[
\varepsilon x A(x) \ne 0 \rightarrow A(\varepsilon x A(x)) \] which

 requires that if there is no witness to \(A\), the
epsilon term return 0. For the discussion below, however, it is most
convenient to focus on (*) alone.</p>

<p>
Suppose we wish to show that the system above is consistent; in other
words, we wish to show that there is no proof of the formula \(0 =
1\). By pushing all substitutions to the axioms and replacing free
variables by the constant 0, it suffices to show that there is no
propositional proof of \(0 = 1\) from a finite set of closed instances
of the axioms. For that, it suffices to show that, given any finite
set of closed instances of axioms, one can assign numerical values to
terms in such a way that all the axioms are true under the
interpretation. Since the arithmetical operations \(+\) and \(\times\)
can be interpreted in the usual way, the only difficulty lies in
finding appropriate values to assign to the epsilon terms.</p>

<p>
Hilbert&rsquo;s <em>epsilon substitution method</em> can be described,
roughly, as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>Given a finite set of axioms, start by interpreting all epsilon
terms as 0.</li>

<li>Find an instance of the axiom (*) above that is false under the
interpretation. This can only happen if one has a term t such that
\(A(t)\) is true in the interpretation, but either \(A(\varepsilon x
A(x))\) is false or the value of \(t\) is smaller than the value of
\(\varepsilon x A(x)\).</li>

<li>&ldquo;Repair&rdquo; the assignment by assigning to \(\varepsilon
x A(x)\) the value of \(t\), and repeat the process.</li>
</ul>

<p>
A finitary consistency proof is obtained once it is shown in a
finitarily acceptable manner that this process of successive
&ldquo;repairs&rdquo; terminates. If it does, all critical formulas
are true formulas without epsilon-terms.</p>

<p>
This basic idea (the &ldquo;Hilbertsche Ansatz&rdquo;) was set out
first by Hilbert in his 1922 talk (1923), and elaborated in lectures
in 1922&ndash;23. The examples given there, however, only deal with
proofs in which all instances of the transfinite axiom correspond to a
single epsilon term \(\varepsilon x A(x)\). The challenge was to
extend the approach to more than one epsilon term, to nested epsilon
terms, and ultimately to second-order epsilons (in order to obtain a
consistency proof not just of arithmetic, but of analysis).</p>

<p>
The difficulty in dealing with nested epsilon terms can be described
as follows. Suppose one of the axioms in the proof is the transfinite

axiom \[ B(y) \rightarrow B(\varepsilon y B(y)) \] \(\varepsilon y

 B(y)\) may, of course, occur in other formulae in the
proof, in 

particular in other transfinite axioms, e.g., \[ A(x, \varepsilon y
B(y)) \rightarrow A(\varepsilon x A(x, \varepsilon y B(y)),
\varepsilon y B(y)) \] So first, it seems necessary to find a correct

 interpretation for \(\varepsilon y B(y)\)
before we attempt to find one for \(\varepsilon x A(x, \varepsilon y
B(y))\). However, there are more complicated patterns in which epsilon
terms may occur in a proof. An instance of the axiom, which plays a
role in determining the 

correct interpretation for \(\varepsilon y B(y)\) might be \[
B(\varepsilon x A(x, \varepsilon y B(y))) \rightarrow B(\varepsilon y
B(y)) \] If \(B\)(0) is false, then in the first round of the

 procedure \(\varepsilon y B(y)\)
will be interpreted by 0. A subsequent change of the interpretation of
\(\varepsilon x A(x, 0)\) from 0 to, say, \(n\), will result in an
interpretation of this instance as \(B(n) \rightarrow B\)(0) which
will be false if \(B(n)\) is true. So the interpretation of
\(\varepsilon y B(y)\) will have to be corrected to \(n\), which, in
turn, might result in the interpretation of \(\varepsilon x A(x,
\varepsilon y B(y))\) to no longer be a true formula.</p>

<p>
This is just a sketch of the difficulties involved in extending
Hilbert&rsquo;s idea to the general case. Ackermann (1924) provided
such a generalization using a procedure which &ldquo;backtracks&rdquo;
whenever a new interpretation at a given stage results in the need to
correct an interpretation already found at a previous stage.</p>

<p>
Ackermann&rsquo;s procedure applied to a system of second-order
arithmetic, in which, however, second order terms were restricted so
as to exclude cross-binding of second-order epsilons. This amounts,
roughly, to a restriction to arithmetic comprehension as the
set-forming principle available (see the discussion at the end of this
section). Further difficulties with second-order epsilon terms
surfaced, and it quickly became apparent that the proof as it stood
was fallacious. However, no one in Hilbert&rsquo;s school realized the
extent of the difficulty until 1930, when G&ouml;del announced his
incompleteness results. Until then, it was believed that the proof (at
least with some modifications introduced by Ackermann, some of which
involved ideas from von Neumann&rsquo;s (1927) version of the epsilon
substitution method) would go through at least for the first-order
part. Hilbert and Bernays (1939) suggest that the methods used only
provides a consistency proof for first-order arithmetic with open
induction. In 1936, Gerhard Gentzen succeeded in giving a proof of the
consistency of first-order arithmetic in a formulation based on
predicate logic without the epsilon symbol. This proof uses
transfinite induction up to \(\varepsilon_0\). Ackermann (1940) was
later able to adapt Gentzen&rsquo;s ideas to give a correct
consistency proof of first-order arithmetic using the
epsilon-substitution method.</p>

<p>
Even though Ackermann&rsquo;s attempts at a consistency proof for
second-order arithmetic were unsuccessful, they provided a clearer
understanding of the use of second-order epsilon terms in the
formalization of mathematics. Ackermann used second-order epsilon
terms \(\varepsilon f\ A(f)\), where \(f\) is a function variable. In
analogy with the first-order case, \(\varepsilon f\ A(f)\) is a
function for which \(A(f)\) is true, e.g., \(\varepsilon f (x + f(x) =
2x)\) is the identity function \(f(x) = x\). Again in analogy with the
first-order case, one can use second-order epsilons to interpret
second-order quantifiers. In particular, for any second-order formula

\(A(x)\) one can find a term \(t(x)\) such that \[ A(x)
\leftrightarrow t(x) = 1 \] is derivable in the calculus (the formula

 \(A\) may have other free variables, in which case these
appear in the term \(t\) as well). One can then use this fact to
interpret <em>comprehension</em> principles. In a language with

function symbols, these take the form \[ \exists f \forall x (A(x)
\leftrightarrow f(x) = 1) \] for an arbitrary formula

 \(A(x)\). Comprehension is more commonly expressed in
terms of set 

variables, in which case it takes the form \[ \exists Y \forall x
(A(x) \leftrightarrow x \in Y), \] asserting that every second order

 formula, with parameters, defines a set.</p>

<p>

 <a href="../proof-theory/index.html#BeyoAritSubsBZ2"><em>Analysis</em></a>,
 or <em>second-order arithmetic</em>, is the extension of first-order
arithmetic with the comprehension schema for arbitrary second-order
formulae. The theory is <em>impredicative</em> in that it allows one
to define sets of natural numbers using quantifiers that range over
the entire universe of sets, including, implicitly, the set being
defined. One can obtain <em>predicative</em> fragments of this theory
by restricting the type of formulae allowed in the comprehension
axiom. For example, the restriction discussed in connection with
Ackermann above corresponds to the <em>arithmetic comprehension
schema</em>, in which formulae do not involve second-order
quantifiers. There are various ways of obtaining stronger fragments of
analysis that are nonetheless predicatively justified. For example,
one obtains <em>ramified analysis</em> by associating an ordinal rank
to set variables; roughly, in the definition of a set of a given rank,
quantifiers range only over sets of lower rank, i.e., those whose
definitions are logically prior.</p>

<p>
<em>Further Reading</em>. Hilbert&rsquo;s and Ackermann&rsquo;s early
proofs are discussed in Zach 2003; 2004. Von Neumann&rsquo;s proof is
the topic of Bellotti 2016. Ackermann&rsquo;s 1940 proof is discussed
in Hilbert &amp; Bernays 1970, and Wang 1963. A modern presentation is
given by Moser 2006. An early application of epsilon substitution is
the no-counterexample interpretation (Kreisel 1951).</p>

<h2 id="ReceDeve">6. More Recent Developments</h2>

<p>
In this section we discuss the development of the epsilon-substitution
method for obtaining consistency results for strong systems; these
results are of a mathematical nature. We cannot, unfortunately,
discuss the details of the proofs here but would like to indicate that
the epsilon-substitution method did not die with Hilbert&rsquo;s
program, and that a significant amount of current research is carried
out in epsilon-formalisms.</p>

<p>

 <a href="../proof-theory/index.html#GentConsProo">Gentzen&rsquo;s consistency proofs for arithmetic</a>
 launched a field of research known as <em>ordinal analysis</em>, and
the program of measuring the strength of mathematical theories using
ordinal notations is still pursued today. This is particularly
relevant to the <em>extended Hilbert&rsquo;s program</em>, where the
goal is to justify classical mathematics relative to constructive, or
quasi-constructive, systems. Gentzen&rsquo;s methods of
cut-elimination (and extensions to infinitary logic developed by Paul
Lorentzen, Petr Novikov, and Kurt Sch&uuml;tte) have, in large part,
supplanted epsilon substitution methods in these pursuits. But epsilon
calculus methods provide an alternative approach, and there is still
active research on ways to extend Hilbert-Ackermann methods to
stronger theories. The general pattern remains the same:</p>

<ol>

<li>Embed the theory under investigation in an appropriate epsilon
calculus.</li>

<li>Describe a process for updating assignments to the epsilon
terms.</li>

<li>Show that the procedure is normalizing, i.e., given any set of
terms, there is a sequence of updates that results in an assignment
that satisfies the axioms.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Since the last step guarantees the consistency of the original theory,
from a foundational point of view one is interested in the methods
used to prove normalization. For example, one obtains an <em>ordinal
analysis</em> by assigning ordinal notations to steps in the
procedure, in such a way that the value of a notation decreases with
each step.</p>

<p>
In the 1960&rsquo;s, Tait (1960, 1965, 2010) extended
Ackermann&rsquo;s methods to obtain an ordinal analysis of extensions
of arithmetic with principles of transfinite induction. More
streamlined and modern versions of this approach can be found in Mints
2001 and Avigad 2002b. More recently, Mints, Tupailo, and Buchholz
have considered stronger, yet still predicatively justifiable,
fragments of analysis, including theories of arithmetic comprehension
and a \(\Delta^{1}_1\)-comprehension rule (Mints, Tupailo &amp;
Buchholz 1996; Mints &amp; Tupailo 1999; see also Mints 2016). Arai
2002 has extended the epsilon substitution method to theories that
allow one to iterate arithmetic comprehension along primitive
recursive well orderings. In particular, his work yields ordinal
analyses for predicative fragments of analysis involving transfinite
hierarchies and transfinite induction.</p>

<p>
Some first steps have been taken in using the epsilon substitution
method in the analysis of <em>impredicative</em> theories (see Arai
2003, 2006 and Mints 2015).</p>

<p>
A variation on step 3 above involves showing that the normalization
procedure is not sensitive to the choice of updates, which is to say,
<em>any</em> sequence of updates terminates. This is called <em>strong
normalization.</em> Mints 1996 has shown that many of the procedures
considered have this stronger property.</p>

<p>
In addition to the traditional, foundational branch of proof theory,
today there is a good deal of interest in <em>structural proof
theory</em>, a branch of the subject that focuses on logical deductive
calculi and their properties. This research is closely linked with
issues relevant to computer science, having to do with automated
deduction, functional programming, and computer aided verification.
Here, too, Gentzen-style methods tend to dominate (see again the
 <a href="../proof-theory/index.html">entry on proof theory</a>).
 But the epsilon calculus can also provide valuable insights; cf. for
example Aguilera &amp; Baaz 2019, or the discussion of
Herbrand&rsquo;s theorem above.</p>

<p>
Aside from the investigations of the epsilon calculus in proof theory,
two applications should be mentioned. One is the use of epsilon
notation in Bourbaki&rsquo;s <em>Theorie des ensembles</em> (1958).
The second, of perhaps greater current interest, is the use of the
epsilon-operator in the theorem-proving systems
 <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/HVG/HOL/" target="other">HOL</a>
 and
 <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/HVG/Isabelle/" target="other">Isabelle</a>,
 where the expressive power of epsilon-terms yields significant
practical advantages.</p>

<h2 id="EpsiOperLingPhilNonClasLogi">7. Epsilon Operators in Linguistics, Philosophy, and Non-classical Logics</h2>

<p>
Reading the epsilon operator as an indefinite choice operator
(&ldquo;an \(x\) such that \(A(x)\)&rdquo;) suggests that it might be
a useful tool in the analysis of indefinite and definite noun phrases
in formal semantics. The epsilon notation has in fact been so used,
and this application has proved useful in particular in dealing with
anaphoric reference.</p>

<p>
Consider the familiar example</p>

<ol>

<li>Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The generally accepted analysis of this sentence is given by the
universal sentence</p>

<ol>

<li value="2">\(\forall x \forall y (\mathrm{Farmer}(x) \wedge
\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \wedge \mathrm{Owns}(x, y)) \rightarrow
\mathrm{Beats}(x, y))\)</li>
</ol>

<p>
The drawback is that &ldquo;a donkey&rdquo; suggest an existential
quantifier, and thus the analysis should, somehow, parallel in form
the analysis of sentence 3 given by 4:</p>

<ol>

<li value="3">Every farmer who owns a donkey is happy,</li>

<li>\(\forall x (\mathrm{Farmer}(x) \wedge \exists y
(\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \wedge \mathrm{Owns}(x, y)) \rightarrow
\mathrm{Happy}(x))\),</li>
</ol>

<p>
but the closest possible formalization,</p>

<ol>

<li value="5">\(\forall x ((\mathrm{Farmer}(x) \wedge \exists y
(\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \wedge \mathrm{Owns}(x, y)) \rightarrow
\mathrm{Beats}(x, y))\)</li>
</ol>

<p>
contains a free occurrence of \(y\). Evans 1980 suggests that since
pronouns are referring expressions, they should be analyzed as
definite descriptions; and if the pronoun occurs in the consequent of
a conditional, the descriptive conditions are determined by the

antecedent. This leads to the following E-type analysis of (1): \[
\begin{multline*}\forall x ((\mathrm{Farmer}(x) \wedge \exists y
(\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \wedge \mathrm{Owns}(x, y))
\rightarrow\\(\mathrm{Beats}(x, \iota y (\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \wedge
\mathrm{Owns}(x, y))) \end{multline*} \] Here, \(\iota x\) is the

 definite description operator, so \(\iota y
(\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \wedge \mathrm{Owns}(x, y))\) is &ldquo;the donkey
owned by \(x\);&rdquo;. The trouble with this is that on the standard
analysis, the definite description carries a uniqueness condition, and
so (5) will be false if there is a farmer who owns more than one
donkey. A way out of this is to introduce a new operator, whe
(whoever, 

whatever) which works as a generalizing quantifier (Neale, 1990): \[
\begin{multline*} \forall x ((\mathrm{Farmer}(x) \wedge \exists y
(\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \wedge \mathrm{Owns}(x, y)) \rightarrow\\
(\mathrm{Beats}(x, \mathrm{whe}\, y (\mathrm{Donkey}(y) \wedge
\mathrm{Owns}(x, y))) \end{multline*} \]

 </p>

<p>
As pointed out by von Heusinger (1994), this suggests that Neale is
committed to pronouns being ambiguous between definite descriptions
\((\iota\)-expressions) and whe-expressions. Heusinger suggests
instead to use epsilon operators indexed by choice functions (which
depend on the context). According to this approach, the analysis of
(1) is</p>

<blockquote>
For every choice function \(i\): 

\[\begin{multline*}
\forall x ((\mathrm{Farmer}(x) \wedge \mathrm{Owns}(x, \varepsilon_i y
\mathrm{Donkey} (y)) \rightarrow \\\mathrm{Beats} (x,
\varepsilon_{a^*}y \mathrm{Donkey} (y))
\end{multline*}
\]

</blockquote>

<p>
Here \(a^*\) is a choice function which depends on \(i\) and the
antecedent of the conditional: If \(i\) is a choice function which
selects \(\varepsilon_i y \mathrm{Donkey}(y)\) from the set of all
donkeys, then \(\varepsilon_{a^*}y \mathrm{Donkey} (y)\) selects from
the set of donkeys owned by \(x\).</p>

<p>
This approach to dealing with pronouns using epsilon operators indexed
by choice functions enable von Heusinger to deal with a wide variety
of circumstances (see Egli and von Heusinger, 1995; von Heusinger,
2000).</p>

<p>
Applications of the epsilon-operator in formal semantics, and choice
functions in general, have received significant interest in recent
years. &nbsp;Von Heusinger and Egli (2000a) list, among others, the
following: representations of questions (Reinhart, 1992), specific
indefinites (Reinhart 1992; 1997; Winter 1997), E-type pronouns
(Hintikka and Kulas 1985; Slater 1986; Chierchia 1992, Egli and von
Heusinger 1995) and definite noun phrases (von Heusinger 1997,
2004).</p>

<p>
For discussion of the issues and applications of the epsilon operator
in linguistics and philosophy of language, see B. H. Slater&rsquo;s
article on epsilon calculi (cited in the Other Internet Resources
section below), and the collections von Heusinger and Egli 2000 and
von Heusinger and Kempson 2004.</p>

<p>
Another application of epsilon calculus is as a general logic for
reasoning about arbitrary objects. Meyer Viol (1995a) provides a
comparison of the epsilon calculus with Fine&rsquo;s (1985) theory of
arbitrary objects. Indeed, the connection is not hard to see. Given
the equivalence \(\forall x A(x) \equiv\) A\((\varepsilon x (\neg
A))\), the term \(\varepsilon x (\neg A)\) is an arbitrary object in
the sense that it is an object of which \(A\) is true iff \(A\) is
true generally.</p>

<p>
Meyer Viol (1995a, 1995b) contain further proof- and model-theoretic
studies of the epsilon calculus; specifically intuitionistic epsilon
calculi. &nbsp;Here, the epsilon theorems no longer hold, i.e.,
introduction of epsilon terms produces non-conservative extensions of
intuitionistic logic. Other investigations of epsilon operators in
intuitionistic logic can be found in Shirai (1971), Bell (1993a,
1993b) and DeVidi (1995). For epsilon-operators in many-valued logics,
see Mostowski (1963), for modal epsilon calculus, Fitting (1975).</p>

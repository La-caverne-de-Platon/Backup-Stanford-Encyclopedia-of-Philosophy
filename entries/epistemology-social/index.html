<h1>Social Epistemology</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Feb 26, 2001; substantive revision Wed Aug 28, 2019</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Until recently, epistemology&mdash;the study of knowledge and
justified belief&mdash;was heavily individualistic in focus. The
emphasis was on evaluating doxastic attitudes (beliefs and disbeliefs)
of individuals in abstraction from their social environment. Social
epistemology seeks to redress this imbalance by investigating the
epistemic effects of social interactions and social systems. After
giving an introduction, and reviewing the history of the field in
sections 1 and 2, we move on to discuss central topics in social
epistemology in section 3. These include testimony, peer disagreement,
and judgment aggregation, among others. Section 4 turns to recent
approaches which have used formal methods to address core topics in
social epistemology, as well as wider questions about the functioning
of epistemic communities like those in science. In section 5 we
briefly turn to questions related to social epistemology and the
proper functioning of democratic societies. </p>

<h2 id="WhatSociEpis">1. What is Social Epistemology?</h2>

<p>
What do we mean by the phrase &ldquo;social epistemology&rdquo;, the
topic covered in this entry?</p>

<p>
Social epistemology gets its distinctive character by standing in
contrast with what might be dubbed &ldquo;individual&rdquo;
epistemology. Epistemology in general is concerned with how people
should go about the business of trying to determine what is true, or
what are the <em>facts</em> of the matter, on selected topics. In the
case of individual epistemology, the person or agent in question who
seeks the truth is a single individual who undertakes the task all by
himself/herself, without consulting others. By contrast
<em>social</em> epistemology is, in the first instance, an enterprise
concerned with how people can best pursue the truth (whichever truth
is in question) <em>with the help</em> of, or <em>in the face</em> of,
others. It is also concerned with truth acquisition by groups, or
collective agents. </p>

<p>
According to the most influential tradition in (Western) epistemology,
illustrated vividly by Ren&eacute; Descartes (1637), standard
epistemology has taken the form of individual epistemology, in which
the object of study is how epistemic agents, using their personal
cognitive devices, can soundly investigate assorted questions.
Descartes contended that the most promising way to pursue truth is by
one&rsquo;s own reasoning. The remaining question was how, exactly,
truth was to be found by suitable individualistic maneuvers, starting
from one&rsquo;s own introspected mental contents. Another major
figure in the history of the field was John Locke (1690), who insisted
that knowledge be acquired through intellectual self-reliance. As he
put it, &ldquo;other men&rsquo;s opinions floating in one&rsquo;s
brain&rdquo; do not constitute genuine knowledge. </p>

<p>
In contrast with the individualistic orientations of Descartes and
Locke, social epistemology proceeds on the commonsensical idea that
information can often be acquired from others. To be sure, this step
cannot be taken unless the primary investigator has already determined
that there <em>are</em> such people, a determination that presumably
requires the use of individual resources (hearing, seeing, language,
etc.) Social epistemology should thus not be understood as a wholly
distinct and independent form of epistemology, but one that rests on
individual epistemology. </p>

<p>
Surprisingly, social epistemology does not have a very long, or rich,
history. With perhaps a few exceptions, it has not been explored by
philosophy with much systematicity until recent times. The case of
modern science, by contrast, was rather different. The Royal Society of London was created
in 1660, intended to highlight the importance of multiple observers in
establishing recognized facts. (And, as we will see throughout the
entry, there are important connections between philosophy of science
and social epistemology.) But the leading figures of philosophy
commonly tended to present themselves as solitary investigators. To be
sure, they did not refrain from debating with one another. But insofar
as the topic was &ldquo;epistemology&rdquo; (as it came to be called),
it centered on the challenges and practices of individual agents.</p>

<h2 id="GiviShapFielSociEpis">2. Giving Shape to the Field of Social Epistemology</h2>

<p>
A movement somewhat analogous to social epistemology was developed in
the middle part of the 20th century, in which sociologists and
deconstructionists set out to debunk orthodox epistemology, sometimes
challenging the very possibility of truth, rationality, factuality,
and/or other presumed desiderata of mainstream epistemology. Members
of the &ldquo;strong program&rdquo; in the sociology of science, such
as Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar (1986), challenged the notions of
objective truth and factuality, arguing that so-called
&ldquo;facts&rdquo; are not discovered or revealed by science, but
instead &ldquo;constructed&rdquo;, &ldquo;constituted&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;fabricated&rdquo;. &ldquo;There is no object beyond
discourse,&rdquo; they wrote. &ldquo;The organization of discourse
<em>is</em> the object&rdquo; (1986: 73).</p>

<p>
A similar version of postmodernism was offered by the philosopher
Richard Rorty (1979). Rorty rejected the traditional conception of
knowledge as &ldquo;accuracy of representation&rdquo; and sought to
replace it with a notion of &ldquo;social justification of
belief&rdquo;. As he expressed it, there is no such thing as a
classical &ldquo;objective truth&rdquo;. The closest thing to (so
called) truth is merely the practice of &ldquo;keeping the
conversation going&rdquo; (1979: 377). </p>

<p>
Other forms of deconstruction were also inspired by social factors but
were less extreme in embracing anti-objectivist conclusions about
science. Thomas Kuhn (1962/1970) held that purely objective
considerations could never settle disputes between competing theories;
hence scientific beliefs must be influenced by social factors.
Analogously, Michel Foucault developed a radically political view of
knowledge and science, arguing that practices of so-called
knowledge-seeking are driven by quests for power and social domination
(1969 [1972], 1975 [1977]).</p>

<p>
Debates about these topics persisted under the heading of &ldquo;the
science wars&rdquo;. Within the mainstreams of both science and
philosophy, however, the foregoing views have generally been rejected
as implausibly radical. This did not mean that no lessons were learned
about the status of social factors in science and philosophy. These
debates gave important insight into the role of cultural beliefs and
biases in the creation of knowledge. What we shall pursue, however, in
the remainder of this entry is how social epistemology has created a
new branch, or sphere, of mainstream epistemology. According to this
&ldquo;extension&rdquo; of epistemology, social factors can and do
make major contributions to traditional, truth-oriented epistemology
by introducing, broadening, and refining new problems, new techniques,
and new methodologies. But such factors do not undercut the very
notions of truth and falsity, knowledge and error.</p>

<p>
Sharply departing from the debunking themes sketched above, modern
social epistemology is prepared to advance proposals quite continuous
with traditional epistemology. It sees no reason to think that social
factors or practices inevitably interfere with, or pose threats to,
the attainment of truth and/or other epistemic desiderata, such as
justified belief, rational belief, etc. There may indeed be
identifiable cases (which we shall explore) in which specific types of
social factors or social interactions pose threats to truth
acquisition. But, conversely, the right kinds of social organization
may enhance the prospects of truth acquisition.</p>

<p>
A general overview of these different kinds of cases was advanced in a
wide-ranging monograph by Alvin Goldman: <em>Knowledge in a Social
World</em> (1999). This book emerged from several earlier papers
critiquing postmodernist attacks on truth and the prospects of truth
acquisition. They included papers on argumentation (Goldman 1994),
freedom of speech (Goldman and Cox 1996), and scientific inquiry
(Goldman 1987). Other contributions with broadly similar orientations
included C.A.J. Coady&rsquo;s <em>Testimony</em> (1992), Edward
Craig&rsquo;s <em>Knowledge and the State of Nature</em> (1990), and
Philip Kitcher&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Division of Cognitive Labor&rdquo;
(1990) and <em>The Advancement of Science</em> (1993). Margaret
Gilbert&rsquo;s monograph <em>On Social Facts</em> (1989) made a
forceful case for the existence of &ldquo;plural subjects&rdquo;, a
crucial metaphysical component for social epistemology. The journal
<em>Episteme: A Journal of Social Epistemology</em> (Goldman, editor),
was begun in 2004 and played a major role in the positive development
of the field. (A different journal with a similar title, <em>Social
Epistemology</em> (Steve Fuller, editor) began somewhat earlier in
1988, but tilted heavily toward a debunking orientation).</p>

<h2 id="CentTopiSociEpis">3. Central Topics in Social Epistemology</h2>

<p>
In exploring social epistemology we explore how assorted
social-epistemic activities or practices have an impact on the
epistemic outcomes of the agents (or groups) in question. Which
changes in social-epistemic practices are likely to promote, enhance,
or impede epistemic outcomes? To put more flesh on the varieties of
social-epistemic methods and outcomes, let us look at some core
topics. </p>

<h3 id="Test">3.1 Testimony</h3>

<p>
The first kind of social-epistemic scenario is very common. An
individual seeks to determine the truth-value of proposition <i>p</i>
by soliciting the opinion(s) of others. She might direct her question
to one of her personal confidants, or consult what is in print or
available online. Having received responses to her queries, she weighs
what has been said to help her assess the truth of the proposition in
question. This is commonly referred to as
&ldquo;testimony-based&rdquo; belief. The selected informant may still
be a single individual. But appealing to another individual for
testimony already locates the example as within the domain of social
epistemology.</p>

<p>
The main discussion here is framed in terms of justification rather
than knowledge. The standard question is: Under what circumstances is
a hearer justified in trusting an assertion made by a stranger, or by
a consultant or speaker of any variety? David Hume argued that we are
generally entitled to trust what others tell us; but this entitlement
only arises by virtue of what we previously learned from others. Each
of us can recall occasions on which we were told things that we could
not independently verify (from perception, e.g.) but later determined
to be true. This reliable track-record from the past (which we
remember) warrants us in inferring (via induction) that testimony is
generally reliable. As James Van Cleve formulates the view:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Testimony gives us justified belief &hellip; not because it shines by
its own light, but because it has often enough been revealed true by
our other lights. (Van Cleve 2006: 69)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This sort of view is called &ldquo;reductionism&rdquo; (about
testimony) because it &ldquo;reduces&rdquo; the
justification-conferring force of testimony to the combined forces of
perception, memory, and inductive inference. More precisely, the view
is usually called <em>global</em> reductionism, because it argues that
hearers of testimony are justified in believing particular instances
of testimony by inferential appeal to testimony&rsquo;s general
reliability.</p> However, global reductionism has come under fire.
C.A.J. Coady argues that the observational basis of ordinary epistemic
agents is much too thin and limited to allow an induction to the
general reliability of testimony. He writes:

<blockquote>

<p>
[It] seems absurd to suggest that, individually, we have done anything
like the amount of field-work that [reductionism] requires &hellip;
[M]any of us have never seen a baby born, nor have many of us examined
the circulation of the blood nor the actual geography of the world
&hellip; nor a vast number of other observations that [reductionism]
would seem to require. (Coady 1992: 82)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
An alternative to global reductionism is <em>local</em> reductionism
(E. Fricker 1994). Local reductionism does not require hearers to be
justified in believing the <em>general</em> reliability of testimony.
It only requires hearers to be justified in trusting the reliability
of the specific speakers whose current testimony is in question on a
particular subject. This requirement is more easily satisfied than
global reductionism. Local reductionism may still be too strong,
however, but for a different reason. Is a speaker <i>S</i> trustworthy
for hearer <i>H</i> only if <i>H</i> has positive evidence or
justification for <i>S</i>&rsquo;s general reliability? This is far
from clear. If I am at an airport or train station and hear a public
announcement of the departure gate (or track), am I justified in
believing this testimony only if I have prior evidence of the
announcer&rsquo;s general reliability? Normally I do not possess such
evidence for a given public address announcer. But, surely, I am
justified in trusting such announcements.</p>

<p>
Given these problems for both kinds of reductionism, some
epistemologists embrace testimonial <em>anti-reductionism</em> (Coady
1992; Burge 1993; Foley 1994; Lackey 2008). Anti-reductionism holds
that testimony is itself a basic source of evidence or justifiedness.
No matter how little positive evidence a hearer has about the
reliability and sincerity of a given speaker, or of speakers in
general, she has default or <em>prima facie</em> warrant in believing
what the speaker says. Thus Tyler Burge writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[A] person is entitled to accept as true something that is presented
as true and that is intelligible to him, unless there are stronger
reasons not to do so. (Burge 1993: 457) </p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="PeerDisa">3.2 Peer Disagreement</h3>

<p>
In the preceding example, it was tacitly assumed that the hearer had
no prior belief (one way or the other) about the topic in question.
His/her mind was completely open prior to receiving the testimony of
the speaker. Now let us consider a different class of examples
(modified from one given by David Christensen [2007]). Suppose that
two people start out with opposing views on a given topic; one of them
believes proposition <i>p</i> and the other believes not-<i>p</i>. To
add a little color, consider an example in which two friends, Harry
and Mary, have each acquired some evidence about a traffic accident
described in the morning newspaper. Neither has any other evidence
about the incident. For example, neither has any background knowledge
or information about the people said to be involved in the incident.
However, having read the newspaper account, both Harry and Mary form
beliefs about it. Harry believes that Jones (described in the
newspaper) was responsible for the accident. Mary believes that Jones
was not responsible. Harry and Mary now run into each other, find out
that their friend has read the same story, and discuss their views
about the accident. To make the example even more interesting, suppose
the two friends have as much respect for the other person&rsquo;s
judgment (in such matters) as they do for themselves. This might be
based on the fact that when they have disagreed with one another in
the past, each turned out to be right about 50% of the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
In such a situation, we shall call the two people epistemic peers.
Epistemologists have adopted the label &ldquo;peer disagreement&rdquo;
for the problem generated by such cases (actual or hypothetical). The
problem is: how, if at all, should an agent adjust her initial belief
about the specified proposition upon learning that her peer holds a
contrary position? Should she (always?) modify her belief (or strength
of belief) in the direction of the peer? Or is it sometimes
epistemically permissible to hold &ldquo;steadfast&rdquo; to
one&rsquo;s own original conviction?</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Conciliationism&rdquo; is the view that (some degree of)
modification is always called for, because it requires epistemic
agents in the specified type of situation to make some obeisance to
the belief of their peer, rather than ignoring or dismissing it
entirely. Proponents of conciliationism include Christensen (2007),
Richard Feldman (2007), and Adam Elga (2007).</p>

<p>
Feldman (2007) offers an abstract argument for conciliationism based
on what he calls the &ldquo;uniqueness thesis&rdquo;. This is the view
that for any proposition <i>p</i> and any body of evidence <i>E</i>,
exactly one doxastic attitude is the rational attitude to have toward
<i>p</i>, where the possible attitudes include believing <i>p</i>,
disbelieving <em>p,</em> and suspending judgment. Feldman&rsquo;s
argument seems to be that if the uniqueness theory is true, then when
I believe <i>p</i> and my peer believes not-<i>p</i>, at least one of
us must have formed an irrational opinion. Since I have no good reason
to believe that I am not the misguided believer, the only rational
option is to suspend judgment. But few people accept the uniqueness
thesis. Are epistemic rules or principles really (always) so precise
and restrictive?</p>

<p>
Critics of conciliationism offer a number of reasons for rejecting it
as a systematic epistemic requirement. One line of criticism runs as
follows. Conciliationism may well be self-refuting. Since the truth of
conciliationism is itself a matter of controversy, a proponent of
conciliationism should become much less convinced of its truth when he
learns about this controversy. One may worry that there is something
wrong with a principle that tells you not to believe in its own truth.
(For further discussion, see Christensen 2013.)</p>

<p>
Thomas Kelly (2010) offers a different reason for rejecting
conciliationism, or at least for denying its ubiquitous
appropriateness. He argues as follows: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[If] you and I have arrived at our opinions in response to a
substantial body of evidence, and your opinion is a reasonable
response to the evidence while mine is not, then you are not required
to give equal weight to my opinion and to your own. Indeed, one might
wonder whether you are required to give <em>any</em> weight to my
opinion in such circumstances. (2010: 135) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He acknowledges that whether one reasons well or badly, one might be
equally confident in one&rsquo;s conclusion in both cases. However, he
contends, &ldquo;We should not thereby be drawn to the conclusion that
the deliverances of good reasoning and bad reasoning have the same
epistemic status&rdquo; (2010: 141). Rather, the person that reasons
better (from the same evidence) may well be more entitled to his/her
conclusion than the person who reasons worse. It may be rational for
her to hold fast to her initial belief. This approach is what Kelly
calls the &ldquo;Total Evidence View&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="EpisCollAgen">3.3 The Epistemology of Collective Agents</h3>

<p>
The cases discussed thus far focus on epistemic agents who are
individuals. We subsumed these cases under the heading of
<em>social</em> epistemology not because the believers themselves have
some sort of social character, but because there are players who rely
upon, or appeal to, other epistemic agents. However, there are other
types of cases that are naturally treated as social epistemology for
an entirely different reason.</p>

<p>
It is common to ascribe actions, intentions, and representational
states&mdash;including belief states&mdash;to collections or groups of
people. Such collections would include juries, panels, governments,
assemblies, teams, etc. The State of California might be said to know
that chemical XYZ is a cause of cancer. What does it take for a group
to believe something? Some take what is called the &ldquo;summative
approach&rdquo;&mdash;a group believes something just in case all, or
almost all, of its members hold the belief (see, for instance, Quinton
1976: 17). Margaret Gilbert, however, has pointed out that in ordinary
language use it is common to ascribe a belief to a group without
assuming that all members hold the belief in question. In seeking to
address why this usage is acceptable, she advances a
&ldquo;collective&rdquo; account of group belief. Under this view:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A group <i>G</i> believes that <i>p</i> if and only if the members of
<i>G</i> are <em>jointly committed</em> to believe that <i>p</i> as a
body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Joint commitments create normative requirements for group members to
emulate a single believer of <em>p.</em> On Gilbert&rsquo;s account,
the commitment to act this way is common knowledge, and if group
members do not act accordingly they can be held normatively
responsible by their peers for failing to do so (see Gilbert 1987,
1989, 2004). Frederick Schmitt (1994a), similarly offers a collective,
commitment-based account of group belief.</p>

<p>
Some have argued that these views are not properly about group belief
because they focus on responsibility to peers, and not on the
beliefs-states of the group members. Wray (2001) suggests that these
should be considered accounts of group acceptance instead. Later in
the entry, we will address some accounts that take individual beliefs
as inputs and output some group belief. It will become clear how
different these are from a joint commitment type view.</p>

<p>
A different approach is taken by Alexander Bird (2014) who contends
that the acceptance model of group belief is only one of many
different (but legitimate) models. For instance, he introduces the
&ldquo;distributed model&rdquo; to deal with systems that feature
information-intensive tasks which cannot be processed by a single
individual. Several individuals must gather different pieces of
information while others coordinate this information and use it to
complete the task. A famous example is provided by Edwin Hutchins
(1995) who describes a large ship where different crew members take
different bearings so that a plotter can determine the ship&rsquo;s
position and course. Members in such a distributed system will not
ordinarily satisfy the conditions of mutual awareness and commitment
that Gilbert and Schmitt require. Nonetheless, this seems to be a
perfectly plausible species of group belief. Indeed, Bird contends
that this is a fairly standard type of group model that occurs in
science. Notice that for this model, again, it is quite possible that
not all members of the group hold the same belief.</p>

<h3 id="JudgAggr">3.4 Judgment Aggregation</h3>

<p>
What about other attempts to provide an account of group belief?
Christian List and Philip Pettit (2011) explore how individuals may
yield a group belief through &ldquo;judgment aggregation&rdquo;.
Although List and Pettit do not put it this way, it seems that
aggregation refers to metaphysical relations between beliefs of group
members and beliefs of the groups they compose. It refers to ways in
which a set of beliefs by group members can give rise to beliefs held
by the group. Here is how List and Pettit express these metaphysical
relations:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The things a group agent does are clearly determined by the things its
members do: they cannot emerge independently. In particular, no group
agent can form propositional attitudes without the latter
attitudes&rsquo; being determined, in one way or another, by certain
contributions of its members, and no group agent can act without one
or more of its members acting. (2011: 64)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The foregoing passage places some limits on the metaphysical relations
between member attitudes and group attitudes. It tells us something
about when group propositional attitudes occur, without implying
anything about when the latter attitudes are justified. But social
epistemologists are interested in the relation between the epistemic
statuses of members&rsquo; beliefs and the epistemic status of group
beliefs. List and Pettit address (something like) this question by
exploring the sorts of judgment &ldquo;functions&rdquo;, i.e., rules
for aggregation, that might come into play.</p>

<p>
A sticky problem that emerges here is the &ldquo;doctrinal
paradox,&rdquo; originally formulated by Kornhauser and Sager (1986)
in the context of legal judgments. Suppose that a court consisting of
three judges must render a judgment in a breach-of-contract case. The
group judgment is to be based on each of three related propositions,
where the first two propositions are premises and the third
proposition is the conclusion. For example:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>The defendant was legally obliged not to do a certain action.</li>

<li>The defendant did do that action.</li>

<li>The defendant is liable for breach of contract.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Legal doctrine entails that obligation and action are jointly
necessary and sufficient for liability. That is, conclusion (3) is
true if and only if the two preceding premises, (1) and (2), are each
true. Suppose, however, as shown in the table below, that the three
judges form the indicated beliefs, vote accordingly, and the
judgment-aggregation function delivers a conclusion guided by majority
rule. In this case, the court as a whole forms beliefs and casts votes
as shown below:</p>

<table class="hrules cellpad-small centered">
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td>Obligation?</td>
  <td>Action?</td>
  <td>Liable?</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>Judge 1</td>
  <td> True</td>
  <td> True</td>
  <td> True</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>Judge 2</td>
  <td> True</td>
  <td> False</td>
  <td> False</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>Judge 3 </td>
  <td>False</td>
  <td> True</td>
  <td> False</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td>Group</td>
  <td> True</td>
  <td> True</td>
  <td> False</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
In this example, each of the three judges has a logically
self-consistent set of beliefs. Moreover, a majority aggregation
function seems eminently reasonable. Nonetheless, the upshot is that
the court&rsquo;s judgments are jointly inconsistent.</p>

<p>
This kind of problem arises easily when a judgment is made by multiple
members of a collective entity. This led List and Pettit to prove an
impossibility theorem in which a reasonable-looking combination of
constraints is nonetheless shown to be jointly unsatisfiable in
judgment aggregation (List and Pettit 2011: 50). They begin by
introducing four conditions that seem to be ones that a reasonable
aggregation function should satisfy:</p>

<p>
<em>Universal domain</em>: The aggregation function admits as input
any possible profile of individual attitudes toward the propositions
on the agenda, assuming that individual attitudes are consistent and
complete.</p>

<p>
<em>Collective rationality</em>: The aggregation function produces as
output consistent and complete group attitudes toward the propositions
on the agenda.</p>

<p>
<em>Anonymity</em>: All individuals&rsquo; attitudes are given equal
weight in determining the group attitude.</p>

<p>
<em>Systematicity</em>: The group attitude on each proposition depends
on the individuals&rsquo; attitudes toward it, not on their attitudes
toward other propositions, and the pattern of dependence between
individual and collective attitudes is the same for all
propositions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Although these four conditions seem initially plausible, they cannot
be jointly satisfied. Having proved this List and Pettit proceed to
explore &ldquo;escape routes&rdquo; from this impossibility. They
offer ways to relax the requirements so that majority voting, for
example, does satisfy the collective rationality
desideratum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Briggs et al. (2014) offer a particular way out. As they argue, it may
be too strong to require that entities always have logically
consistent beliefs. For instance, we might have many beliefs about
matters of fact, and also believe it likely we are wrong about some of
them. Following Joyce (1998), they introduce a weaker notion of
coherence of beliefs. They show that the majority voting aggregation
of logically consistent beliefs will always be coherent, and the
aggregation of coherent beliefs will typically be coherent as well. In
other words, if we demand less from majority voting as a means of
judgment aggregation, we can get it.</p>

<p>
In thinking about practical cases outside jury deliberation, we might
ask whether the theory of judgment aggregation can apply to the
increasingly common problem of how collaborating scientific authors
should decide what statements to endorse. Solomon (2006), for
instance, argues that voting might help scientists avoid
&ldquo;groupthink&rdquo; arising from group deliberation. While Wray
(2014) defends deliberation as crucial to the production of group
consensus, Bright et al. (2018) point out that consensus is not always
necessary (or possible) in scientific reporting. In such cases, they
argue, majority voting is a good way to decide what statements a
report will endorse, even if there is disagreement in the group.</p>

<h3 id="GrouJust">3.5 Group Justification</h3>

<p>
Until this point, we have only looked at how a group belief may arise
from, or be determined by, its member beliefs. We have not yet
considered how&mdash;or whether&mdash;a group entity can achieve some
significant level of epistemic &ldquo;status&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;achievement&rdquo;. Believing something that is true is
certainly worth something, but if one gets the truth only by luck or
accident, that is not very significant. Similarly, simply having a set
of coherent beliefs isn&rsquo;t of unqualified significance, since
mere coherence can arise from pure imagination coupled with
inconsistency avoidance. Philosophers have long agreed that one of the
most important types of epistemic attainment is <em>knowledge.</em>
But what is knowledge? Almost everyone agrees that mere true belief
isn&rsquo;t knowledge. Again, true beliefs can sometimes arise
fortuitously, by pure guessing or wishful thinking.</p>

<p>
One popular way of strengthening the requirements for knowledge is to
add a <em>justification</em> requirement. A true belief doesn&rsquo;t
<em>per se</em> qualify as knowledge unless the belief is
<em>justified.</em> Justification is widely accepted as one species,
or variety, of epistemic achievement. In addition to providing
(arguably) an essential condition for knowledge, it seems to be an
achievement, or attainment, in its own right, even when it
doesn&rsquo;t bring truth in along with it. For this reason,
epistemologists have paid considerable attention to the nature of
justification. Of course, most of this attention is concentrated on
justification by <em>individual</em> believers. But, as we shall see,
it is worth pursuing the possibility that <em>group</em> beliefs can
also be evaluated as either justified or unjustified.</p>

<p>
If the government of the United States believes (or were to believe)
that there is a crisis of global warming, it would probably be
justified in believing this, because of the overwhelming consensus of
climate scientists to this effect. It is probably <em>not</em>
required, however, that <em>all</em> members of a group must believe a
given proposition in order that the group belief be justified, as
Jennifer Lackey rightly says in criticizing the view of Frederick
Schmitt (1994a: 265). It would make group justification too hard to
come by (Lackey 2016: 249&ndash;250). But how, more precisely, should
the requirement be specified?</p>

<p>
Goldman (1979) advocates process reliabilism as an account of
individual justification. He proposes an analogous approach to group
justification in Goldman (2014). Under individual process reliabilism,
a person is justified in believing a proposition <i>W</i> only if she
believes <i>W</i> through using a generally reliable belief-forming
process (or sequences of processes). In addition, if a person&rsquo;s
belief in <i>W</i> were produced by previous beliefs of hers, those
other beliefs must also have been justified in order that her belief
in <i>W</i> qualify as justified.</p>

<p>
As indicated, Goldman&rsquo;s approach to collective justifiedness is
analogous to individual justifiedness. But how exactly is it
analogous? First, members&rsquo; premises that contribute to the
justification of a group&rsquo;s belief must themselves be justified.
A further requirement for group justification is that the
group&rsquo;s belief be caused by a type of belief-forming process
that takes inputs from member beliefs in proposition <i>p</i> and
outputs a group belief in <i>p</i>. The constraint on group
justifiedness is a requirement that such a process type must be
generally conditionally reliable. An example of such a process type
might be a majoritarian process in which member beliefs (of the group)
are aggregated into a group belief. The process is conditionally
reliable only if, when it receives true input beliefs, most of the
output beliefs are also true.</p>

<p>
Lackey (2016), in critiquing Goldman&rsquo;s theory, offers a number
of challenging and insightful problems. Their numerosity and detail
make it unfeasible to present or even summarize many of them. Let us
consider one such objection.</p>

<p>
Goldman advances a certain principle (GJ) which runs as follows: If a
group belief in <i>p</i> is aggregated based on a profile of
members&rsquo; attitudes toward <i>p</i>, then <em>ceteris
paribus</em> the greater the proportion of members who justifiedly
believe <i>p</i> and the smaller the proportion of members who
justifiedly reject <i>p</i>, the greater the group&rsquo;s level, or
grade, of group justifiedness in believing <i>p</i> (Goldman 2014:
28). In other words, group justifiedness increases with a greater
percentage of individual members with justified beliefs.</p>

<p>
Lackey acknowledges that (GJ) &ldquo;is not only intuitively
plausible, it also is easily supported by applying an aggregative
framework to group justifiedness&rdquo; (2016: 361). Nonetheless, she
proceeds to argue that (GJ) should be rejected. One major theme in her
critique is that (GJ) falls prey to a paradox (on contradiction),
which she calls the &ldquo;Group Justification Paradox.&rdquo; It
questionably allows a group to end up justifiedly believing
<em>both</em> a certain relevant proposition <em>and</em> its
negation. Lackey hastens to acknowledge that not all contradictions,
or inconsistencies, are necessarily fatal. For example, the well-known
preface paradox is a case that generates inconsistent propositions,
but it is nevertheless reasonable to have. An author&rsquo;s apology
in the preface is epistemically reasonable, given our grounds for
holding that we all have our own fallibility (2016: 364). However,
Lackey continues, the Group Justification Paradox admits no such
approval. So the incidence of such contradictions <em>does</em>
constitute a challenge to the proposed theory of group justification,
even if the preface paradox does not present a problem.</p>

<h3 id="IdenExpeCaseApplSociEpis">3.6 Identifying Experts: A Case of Applied Social Epistemology</h3>

<p>
We return now to the basic form of social epistemology, in which
individual cognizers seek information from other individuals. Here we
are interested not in the concepts of justification or knowledge in
general, but in particular applications. This might be called
<em>applied</em> social epistemology. For example, how can one
identify other individuals as sources of accurate information? A
salient type of case is when one seeks information from an
&ldquo;expert,&rdquo; where the seeker is himself/herself a layperson.
Unfortunately, experts don&rsquo;t always agree with one another. If
you are offered advice by two different (putative) experts, but the
two advisers disagree, which one should you trust, or believe?</p>

<p>
What is meant by an &ldquo;expert&rdquo;? For present purposes, let us
focus on factual subject matters (rather than matters of taste, for
example). By an expert, then, we shall mean someone who&mdash;in a
specified domain&mdash;possesses a greater quantity of (accurate)
information than most other people do. A layperson, by contrast, is
someone who has very little information in the specified domain, and
who doesn&rsquo;t take him/herself to have such information. The
problem facing the layperson is how to select, among the disagreeing
putative experts, the one that is best (Goldman 2001).</p>

<p>
There are several possible methods by which the layperson might
proceed. A first possible method is to seek statements or arguments
from the competing (putative) experts to assess which one seems to be
more knowledgeable, better-informed, and savvy (in the domain) as
compared to his/her rivals. The problem here is: how can a layperson
make an accurate assessment of the competing experts&rsquo;
performance? By definition, the layperson is someone who is
ill-informed on the subject. Moreover, experts often use language that
is technical, arcane, rarified, or esoteric.</p>

<p>
A second possible method is for the layperson to obtain information
about the competing experts&rsquo; credentials. Where were the
competing experts trained in the domain in question? What were the
competing experts&rsquo; records of performance during their
education? These are matters that the layperson may be unable to
determine. And even if they are determined, is the layperson in a
position to assess their significance?</p>

<p>
A third method that a layperson might consider employing is how many
other putative experts <em>agree</em> with a specified target expert
on many of the questions in the target domain. If a given expert is an
outlier on the issue in question, that might be a reason to avoid
him/her. Conversely, if a large number of (putative) experts agree
with the selected target, doesn&rsquo;t that give extra weight to the
latter&rsquo;s promise as a sound advisor? Surely, a large number of
concurring experts should provide strong support for a selected
individual.</p>

<p>
This is a tricky matter. There are many possible reasons why so many
people in a field might agree, and such agreement doesn&rsquo;t always
signal that they are all correct. One possibility is that all the
foregoing putative experts were trained by one and the same
&ldquo;guru&rdquo;, who was a very persuasive and compelling figure.
(Using a Bayesian analysis, it becomes clear that identifying an extra
concurring believer need not strengthen one&rsquo;s evidence as
compared with a single believer. See Goldman (2001:
99&ndash;102).)</p>

<p>
A fourth possible method is for the layperson to verify, by his/her
own observation, that a candidate expert was <em>correct</em> in
previous cases where he/she offered a view on the topic in question.
The problem here is whether a layperson is capable of making such
observations or determinations. It <em>is</em> possible in a selected
range of cases. A layperson might consult with a broker to decide
whether a certain investment is advisable. The broker gives her the
go-ahead based on a prediction that the market in question will rise
in the next three years. The layperson makes the investment, waits
three years, and notes that the broker was right: the market did rise
in those three years. The layperson couldn&rsquo;t have made this
prediction on the basis of her own knowledge. But she is able (after
three years) to conclude that the putative expert was correct.
Repeated instances of this kind would strengthen the support.</p>

<h2 id="FormApprSociEpis">4. Formal Approaches to Social Epistemology</h2>

<p>
We have now seen some of the problems that face those who develop
knowledge within a community. In recent years philosophers have turned
to formal methods to understand some of these social aspects of belief
and knowledge formation. There are broadly two approaches in this
vein. The first comes from the field of formal epistemology, which
mostly uses proof-based methods to consider questions that mostly
originate within individual-focused epistemology. Some work in this
field, though, considers questions related to, for example, judgment
aggregation and testimony. The second approach, sometimes dubbed
&ldquo;formal social epistemology&rdquo;, stems largely from
philosophy of science, where researchers have employed modeling
methods to understand the workings of epistemic communities. While
much of this work has been motivated by a desire to understand the
workings of science, it is often widely applicable to social aspects
of belief formation.</p>

<p>
Another distinction between these traditions is that while formal
epistemologists tend to focus on questions related to ideal belief
creation, such as what constitutes rationality, formal <em>social</em>
epistemologists have been more interested in explaining real human
behavior, and designing good knowledge-creation systems. We will now
briefly discuss relevant work from formal epistemology, and then look
at three topics in formal social epistemology.</p>

<h3 id="FormEpisSociReal">4.1 Formal Epistemology in the Social Realm</h3>

<p>
As mentioned, formal epistemology has mostly focused on issues related
to individual epistemology. This said, there is a significant portion
of this literature addressing questions central to social
epistemology. In particular: how should a group aggregate their
beliefs? And: how should Bayesians update on the testimony of
others?</p>

<p>
As we have already seen, in aggregating propositional judgments groups
of people can reach paradoxical outcomes as a result of majority
voting. Let&rsquo;s change focus, though, from propositional beliefs,
to a more fine-grained notion of belief. Formal epistemologists more
commonly discuss degrees of belief, or &ldquo;credences&rdquo;. These
are numbers between 0 and 1 representing an agent&rsquo;s degree of
certainty in a statement. (For instance, if I think there is a 90%
chance it is raining, my credence that it is raining is .9.) This
representation changes the question of judgement aggregation to
something like this: Suppose a group of people hold different
credences, what should the group credence be?</p>

<p>
In formal epistemology, this ends up being very closely related to the
question of how an individual ought to update their credences upon
learning the credences of others. If a rational group ought to adopt
some aggregated belief, then it might also make sense for an
individual in the group to adopt the same belief as a result of
learning about the credences of his/her peers. In other words, the
problems of judgment aggregation, peer disagreement, and testimony are
entangled in this literature. (Though see Easwaran et al. (2016) for a
discussion of distinctions between these issues.) We&rsquo;ll focus
here on belief aggregation, though we will comment throughout on these
other issues.</p>

<p>
In principle, there are many ways that one can go about aggregating
credences or pooling opinions (Genest and Zidek 1986). A simple option
is to combine opinions by linear pooling&mdash;taking a weighted
average of credences. This averaging could respect all credences
equally, or put extra weights on the opinions of, say, recognized
experts. This option has some nice properties, such as preserving
unanimous agreement, and allowing groups to aggregate over different
topics independently (DeGroot 1974; Lehrer and Wagner
 1981).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In thinking about ideal knowledge creation though, we might ask how a
<em>Bayesian</em> should update their credences in light of peer
disagreement or how a group of Bayesians should aggregate beliefs.
Bayes rule gives the rational way an agent should update a prior
probabilistic credence in light of evidence to obtain a posterior
credence. In general, if evidence appears that is more likely given
<i>A</i> than <i>B</i>, a Bayesian will increase their credence that
<i>A</i> in fact obtains upon observing that evidence. (So if I have a
.9 credence that it is raining, and someone walks in wearing shorts
and with perfectly dry hair, my credence in rain should decrease
because my observation is more likely to occur on a sunny day than a
rainy one.) Why is this approach rational? An individual who does not
change credences according to Bayes rule can be Dutch
booked&mdash;offered a series of bets that they will take, but that
are guaranteed to lose money.</p>

<p>
A Bayesian will not simply average across beliefs, except under
particular assumptions or in special cases (Genest and Zidek 1986;
Bradley 2007; Steele 2012; Russell et al. 2015). And a group that
engages in linear averaging of this sort can typically be Dutch
booked.</p>

<p>
A fully-fledged Bayesian approach to aggregation demands that the
final credence be derived by Bayesian updating in light of the
opinions held by each group member (Keeney and Raiffa 1993). Notice,
this is also what a Bayesian individual should do to update on the
credences of others. To do this properly, though, is very
 complicated.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 It requires prior probabilities about what obtains in the world, as
well as probabilities about how likely each group member is to develop
their credences in light of what might obtain in world. This will not
be practical in real cases.</p>

<p>
Instead, many approaches consider features that are desirable for
rational aggregation, and then ask which simpler aggregation rules
satisfy them. For instance, one thing a rational aggregation method
should do (to prevent Dutch booking) is yield the same credence
regardless of whether information is obtained before or after
aggregating. For instance, if we all have credences about the rain,
and someone comes in wearing shorts, it should not matter to the final
group output whether 1) they entered and we all updated our credences
(in a Bayesian way) and then aggregated them, or 2) we aggregated our
credences, they entered, and we updated the aggregated credence (in a
Bayesian way). Geometric methods, which take the geometric average of
probabilities over <em>worlds</em>, yield this desirable property in
many cases (Genest 1984; Dietrich and List
 2015).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 These methods proceed by multiplying (weighted) credences over worlds
that might obtain and then renormalizing them to sum to 1.</p>

<p>
One thing that geometric averaging does not do, though, is allow for
credences over different propositions to be aggregated completely
independently from each other. (Recall that this was something List
and Pettit treated as a desideratum for judgment aggregation.) For
instance, our beliefs about the probabilities of hail might influence
how we will aggregate our beliefs over the probabilities of rain.
Instead, a more holistic approach to aggregation is required. This is
an important lesson for approaches to social epistemology which focus
on individual topics of interest in addressing peer disagreement and
testimony (Russell et al. 2015).</p>

<p>
Another thing that some take to be strange about geometric averaging
is that it sometimes will aggregate identical credences to a different
group credence. For instance, we might all have credence .7 that it is
raining, but our group credence might be .9. Easwaran et al. (2016)
argue, though, that this often makes sense when updating on the
credences of others&mdash;their confidence <em>should</em> make us
more confident (see also Christensen
 2009).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
This question of whether aggregated credences can be more extreme than
individual ones echoes much earlier work bearing on the question: are
groups smart? In 1785, the Marquis de Condorcet wrote an essay proving
the following. Suppose a group of individuals form independent beliefs
about a topic and they are each more than 50% likely to reach a
correct judgement. If they take a majority vote, the group is more
likely to vote correctly the larger it gets (in the limit this
likelihood approaches 1). This result, now known as the
&ldquo;Condorcet Jury Theorem&rdquo;, underlies what is sometimes
called the &ldquo;wisdom of the crowds&rdquo;: in the right conditions
combining the knowledge of many can be very effective.</p>

<p>
In many cases, though, real groups are prone to epistemic problems
when it comes to combining beliefs. Consider the phenomenon of
information cascades, first identified by Bikhchandani et al. (1992).
Take a group of agents who almost all have private information that
Nissan stock is better than GM stock. The first agent buys GM stock
based on their (minority) private information. The second agent has
information that Nissan is better, but on the basis of this observed
action updates their belief to think GM is likely better. They also
buy GM stock. The third agent now sees that two peers purchased GM and
likewise updates their beliefs to prefer GM stock. This sets off a
cascade of GM buying among observers who, without social information,
would have bought Nissan. The problem here is a lack of independence
in the &ldquo;vote&rdquo;&mdash;each individual is influenced by the
beliefs and actions of the previous individuals in a way that obscures
the presence of private information. In updating on the credences of
others, we thus may need to be careful to take into account that they
might already have updated on the credences of others.</p>

<h3 id="CredEcon">4.2 The Credit Economy</h3>

<p>
As noted, much of the work in formal social epistemology is by
philosophers of science, who investigate scientific communities in
particular. It will be useful to divide this literature into three
categories: credit economy models of science, network epistemology
models, and modeling approaches to diversity in epistemic
communities.</p>

<p>
Suppose you are a scientist choosing what to work on. There are two
live options. One is more promising, and you suspect that if an
advancement will be made, it will be on that problem. The other is
less promising, but, as a result, fewer scientists are attracted to
it. This means that should a discovery be made in that area, each
scientist will be more likely to have made it.</p>

<p>
The subfield of formal social epistemology arguably started with
Philip Kitcher&rsquo;s 1990 paper &ldquo;The Division of Cognitive
Labor&rdquo;, which takes a rationality-based approach to the question
of why scientists might divide labor effectively, even when they agree
on which problems are most promising. By rationality-based approach,
we mean that Kitcher represents scientists as utility-maximizers, in
much the same way that economists represent people as
utility-maximizers. The key innovation, though, is that scientists are
assumed to derive utility from <em>credit</em>&mdash;a proxy for
recognition and approbation of one&rsquo;s scientific work, along with
all the benefits (promotions, grants, etc.) that follow. The
sociologist Robert Merton was one of the first to recognize the credit
motives of scientists (Merton 1973). Models using this assumption are
often called <em>credit economy</em> models.</p>

<p>
Kitcher&rsquo;s model shows that scientists in the sort of scenario
sketched above will divide labor more effectively when they are
motivated by credit than when they are pure truth-seekers. Truth
seekers will each take the more promising approach. For
credit-maximizers, once too many individuals work on the better
problem, the expected credit for each scientist decreases to the point
that some individuals will prefer to switch. Strevens (2003) extends
Kitcher&rsquo;s work by arguing that an existing feature of credit
incentives, the priority rule, can lead to an even better division of
labor. This is the rule, identified by Merton, which stipulates that
credit will be allocated only to the scientist who first makes a
discovery. In Strevens&rsquo;s model, researchers incentivized by the
priority rule divide labor in a highly efficient way compared to
researchers incentivized by other credit schemes.</p>

<p>
Not all researchers are as optimistic about the consequences of
scientific credit norms like the priority rule. Romero (2017) points
out, for example, that the benefits Kitcher and Strevens identify
disappear in cases where results are not always replicable. (I.e.,
where, as in real scientific communities, any particular study could
give a misleading result, and thus findings require replications
before they can be considered &ldquo;truth&rdquo;.) In particular, the
priority rule strongly disincentivizes scientists from performing
replications because credit is so strongly associated with new,
positive findings.</p>

<p>
This debate reflects a deep question, going back as far as Du Bois
(1898), and at the heart of much of the work in this section: what is
the best motive for an epistemic community? Is it credit seeking or
&ldquo;pure&rdquo; truth seeking? Or some combination of the two?</p>

<p>
This sort of tension over the benefits and detriments of credit
practices also plays out with respect to debates about scientific
fraud. Starting with Merton many have argued that the desire to claim
priority, and thus credit, drives
 fraud.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 These arguments seem to suggest that scientists who ignore credit,
and instead attempt to yield truth will do a better job. Bright
(2017a), though, uses a model to point out that credit-seekers who
fear retaliation may publish more accurate results than truth-seekers
who are convinced of some fact, despite their experimental results to
the contrary. In other words, a true believer may be just as
incentivized to commit fraud as someone who simply seeks approval from
their community.</p>

<p>
We see this debate again over the Matthew effect, identified by Merton
(1968). As Merton points out, pre-eminent scholars often get more
credit for work than a less famous scholar would have gotten. Strevens
(2006) argues that this follows the scientific norm to reward credit
based on the benefit a discovery yields to science and society.
Because famous scientists are more trusted, their discoveries do more
good. Strevens claims that this norm of credit thus improves discovery
in a community. Heesen (2017), on the other hand, uses a credit
economy model to show how someone who gets credit early on due to luck
may later accrue more and more credit because of the Matthew effect.
When this kind of compounding luck happens, he argues, the resulting
stratification of credit in a scientific community does not improve
inquiry.</p>

<p>
As we have seen, credit economy models help answer questions like:
what is the best credit structure for an epistemic community? How do
we promote truth? And: what credit incentives should be
 avoided?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 Once we accept that epistemic communities are more than the sum of
their individual parts, it is crucial to probe the incentive
structures that members of these communities face in thinking about
how best to shape them. As credit economy models show us, designing
good epistemic communities is by no means a trivial task.</p>

<h3 id="NetwEpisMode">4.3 Network Epistemology Models</h3>

<p>
Another paradigm widely used by philosophers to explore social aspects
of epistemology is the epistemic network. This kind of model uses
networks to explicitly represent social or informational ties where
beliefs, evidence, and testimony can be shared.</p>

<p>
There are different ways to do this. In the social sciences generally,
the most popular approach takes a &ldquo;diffusion&rdquo; or
&ldquo;contagion&rdquo; view of beliefs. A belief or idea is
transmitted from individual to individual across their network
connections, much like a virus can be transmitted (Rogers 1962).
Imagine you live in a farming community where a new species of large
caterpillar has started decimating crops. Suppose you come to believe
that this kind of caterpillar is poisonous. You will immediately tell
your friends and neighbors what you have learned, they will tell their
friends and neighbors, and so on. Figure 1 shows this. Black nodes
represent those &ldquo;infected&rdquo; with an idea. It starts with a
focal individual and spreads, virally, through the community.</p>

<div class="figure centered" id="fig-1">
<img src="fig1.png" width="500" alt="a diagram: link to extended description below" />

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1:</span> A network contagion model
where a focal individual infects others with a belief. [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig-1">extended description of figure 1</a>
 is in the supplement.] </p>
</div>

<p>
In these diffusion/contagion models, though, the individuals do not
gather evidence from the world, share evidence with each other, or
form beliefs in any sort of rational way. For this reason,
philosophers of science have tended to use the <em>network
epistemology framework</em> instead. This framework was introduced by
economists Bala and Goyal (1998) to model how individuals learn from
neighbors. It was imported to philosophy by Kevin Zollman, who first
used it to represent scientific communities (Zollman 2007, 2010).</p>

<p>
Now imagine the same caterpillar example, but where the individuals
involved form evidence-based beliefs. One becomes suspicious that the
caterpillar is poisonous, and tests to see if this is true. She shares
the evidence she gathered (not just her belief) with those she is
connected to. Her neighbors, on the basis of this evidence, themselves
become more suspicious that the caterpillar is dangerous, and test for
themselves. They, in turn, share the evidence they gather with their
neighbors. Beliefs can still spread through a network, but now they do
so on the basis of at least semi-rational belief-forming
mechanisms.</p>

<p>
In more detail: network epistemology models start with a collection of
agents on a network, who choose from some set of options. One option
is preferable to the rest, but to find out which this is, the agents
must actually try them and see what results. These could represent
choices of action-guiding theories (like &ldquo;caterpillars are
safe&rdquo; and &ldquo;caterpillars are poisonous&rdquo; or else
&ldquo;vaccines are safe&rdquo; and &ldquo;vaccines cause
autism&rdquo;). They could alternatively represent research approaches
that yield different levels of scientific success.</p>

<p>
Agents have beliefs about which option is preferable, and change these
beliefs in light of the evidence they gather from their actions. In
addition, they also update on evidence gathered by neighbors in the
network, typically using some version of Bayes&rsquo; rule. It is in
this sense that agents are part of an epistemic community. Figure 2
shows what this might look like. The numbers next to each agent
represent their degree of belief in some proposition like
&ldquo;vaccines are safe&rdquo;. The black agents think this is more
likely than not. As this model progresses these agents gather data,
which increases their neighbors&rsquo; degrees of belief in turn.</p>

<div class="figure centered" id="fig-2">
<img src="fig2.png" width="500" alt="a diagram: link to extended description below" />

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 2:</span> Agents in a network
epistemology model use their credences to guide theory testing. Their
results change their credences, and those of their neighbors. [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig-2">extended description of figure 2</a>
 is in the supplement.] </p>
</div>

<p>
Communities in this model can develop beliefs that the better theory
(vaccines are safe) is indeed better, or else they can pre-emptively
settle on the worse theory (vaccines cause autism) as a result of
misleading evidence. Generally, since networks of agents are sensitive
to the evidence they gather, they are more likely to figure out the
&ldquo;truth&rdquo; of which is best (Zollman 2013; Rosenstock et al.
2017).</p>

<p>
Zollman (2007, 2010) describes what has now been dubbed the
&ldquo;Zollman effect&rdquo; in these models; the surprising
observation that it is sometimes worse for communities to communicate
more (see also, Grim 2009). In particular, groups with more network
connections will be generically less likely to arrive at a correct
consensus. The group needs to entertain all the possible options long
enough to gather good evidence and settle on the best one. In tightly
connected networks, misleading evidence is widely shared, and may
cause the community to pre-emptively settle on a poor theory.</p>

<p>
Mayo-Wilson et al. (2011, 2013) likewise defend a surprising thesis,
which supports central claims from social epistemology espoused by
Goldman (1999). They use epistemic network models, to support the so
called &ldquo;independence thesis&rdquo;&mdash;that rational groups
may be composed of irrational individuals, and rational individuals
may constitute irrational groups. For instance, consider a learner who
tests some preferred theory. Alone, she may fail to test other
successful theories, but a community representing a full diversity of
preferred theories will be expected to learn which is best.</p>

<p>
One thing we know about human learners is that they have various
cognitive and social biases that influence how they take up
information from peers. One of these is conformity bias, or a tendency
to espouse the views of group members, even if one secretly disagrees
with them (Asch 1951). Weatherall and O&rsquo;Connor (2018, Other
Internet Resources) show how conformity can prevent the adoption of
successful beliefs because agents who conform to their neighbors are
often unwilling to pass on good information that goes against the
grain. Mohseni and Williams (2019, Other Internet Resources) 
similarly find that conformity
slows learning, likewise because it prevents agents from sharing
information, and because group members who expect this are less
trusting of their 
peers.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Several authors have used variants on the epistemic network model to
explore the phenomenon of &ldquo;polarization&rdquo; within
 groups.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 Both Olsson (2013) and O&rsquo;Connor and Weatherall (2018) consider
versions of the model where actors place less trust in the evidence
(or testimony) of those who do not share their beliefs. A vaccine
skeptic, for instance, might be skeptical of evidence shared by a
physician, but accepting of evidence from a fellow skeptic. This can
lead to stable, polarized camps that each ignore evidence and
testimony coming from the other
 camp.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 The two sets of results just described help answer the question: in
light of real social and learning biases, what can go wrong? And: how
can we shape good epistemic networks to counteract these biases?
(These questions tie into how we should understand democracy in light
of social epistemology.)</p>

<p>
One of the most interesting recent uses of the network epistemology
framework involves investigating the role of pernicious influencers,
especially from industry, on epistemic communities. Holman and Bruner
(2015) look at a network model where one agent shares only fraudulent
evidence meant to support an inferior theory. As they show, this agent
can keep a network from reaching successful consensus by muddying the
water with misleading data. Holman and Bruner (2017) and Weatherall et
al. (forthcoming) use network epistemology models to explore specific
strategies that industry has used to influence scientific research. As
Holman and Bruner show, industry can shape the output of a community
through &ldquo;industrial selection&rdquo;&mdash;funding only agents
whose methods bias them towards preferred findings. Weatherall et al.
add a group of &ldquo;policy makers&rdquo; to the model, to show how a
propagandist can mislead these public agents simply by sharing a
biased sample of the real results produced in an epistemic network.
For example, Big Tobacco might gather up real, independent studies
that happen to find no link between smoking and cancer, and share
these widely (Oreskes and Conway 2011). Together these two papers give
insight into how strategies that do not involve fraud can shape
scientific research and mislead the public.</p>

<p>
One truth about epistemic communities is that relationships matter.
These are the ties that ground testimony, disagreement, and trust.
Epistemic network models allow philosophers to explore processes of
influence in social networks, yield insights into why social ties
matter to the way communities form beliefs, and think about how to
create better knowledge systems.</p>

<h3 id="ModeDiveEpisComm">4.4 Modeling Diversity in Epistemic Communities</h3>

<p>
Diversity has emerged several times in our discussion of formal social
epistemology. Credit incentives can encourage scientists to choose a
diversity of problems. In network models, a transient diversity of
beliefs is necessary for good inquiry. Let us now turn to models that
tackle the influence of diversity more
 explicitly.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 It has been suggested that cognitive diversity benefits epistemic
communities because a group where members start with different
assumptions, use different methodologies, or reason in different ways
may be more likely to find truth.</p>

<p>
Weisberg and Muldoon (2009) introduce a model where actors investigate
an &ldquo;epistemic landscape&rdquo;&mdash;a grid where each section
represents a problem in science, of varying epistemic importance.
Figure 3 shows an example of such a landscape. Scientists are randomly
scattered on the landscape, and follow search rules that are sensitive
to this importance. Investigators can then ask: how well did
scientists do? Did they fully search the landscape? Did they find the
peaks?</p>

<div class="figure centered" id="fig-3">
<img src="fig3.png" width="500" alt="3-d depiction of a surface with multiple peaks and valleys" />

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 3:</span> An epistemic landscape.
Location represents problem choice, and height represents epistemic
significance.</p>
</div>

<p>
Weisberg and Muldoon use the model to argue that a combination of
&ldquo;followers&rdquo; (scientists who work on problems similar to
other scientists) and &ldquo;mavericks&rdquo; (who prefer to explore
new terrain) do better than either group alone; i.e., there is a
benefit to cognitive diversity. Their modeling choices and main result
have been convincingly criticized (Alexander et al. 2015; Thoma 2015; Poyh&ouml;nen
2017; Fern&aacute;ndez Pinto and Fern&aacute;ndez Pinto 2018), but the
framework has been co-opted by other philosophers to useful ends.
Thoma (2015) and Poyh&ouml;nen (2017), for instance, show that in
modified versions of the model, cognitive diversity indeed provides
the sort of benefit Weisberg and Muldoon
 hypothesize.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
Hong and Page (2004) use a simple model to derive their famous
&ldquo;Diversity Trumps Ability&rdquo; result. Agents face a problem
modeled as a ring with some number of locations on it. Each location
is associated with a number representing its goodness as a solution.
An agent, in the model, is represented as a finite set of
&ldquo;heuristics&rdquo;, or integers, such as &lang;3, 7, 10&rang;.
Such an agent is placed on the ring, and can see the locations 3, 7,
and 10 spots ahead of their current position. They then move to
whichever has the highest number until they reach a location where
they can no longer improve their score.</p>

<p>
The central result is that randomly selected <em>groups</em> of agents
who tackle the task together tend to outperform groups created of top
performers. This is because the top performers have similar
heuristics, and thus gain relatively little from group membership,
whereas random agents have a greater variety of heuristics. This
result has been widely cited, though there have been criticisms of the
model either as insufficient to show something so complicated, as
lacking crucial representational features, or as failing to show what
it claims (Thompson 2014; Singer 2019).</p>

<p>
To this point we have addressed cognitive diversity. But we might also
be interested in diversity of social identity in epistemic
communities. Social diversity is an important source of cognitive
diversity, and for this reason can benefit the functioning of
epistemic groups. For instance, different life histories and
experiences may lead individuals to hold different assumptions and
tackle different research programs (Haraway 1989; Longino 1990;
Harding 1991; Hong and Page 2004). If so, then we may want to know:
why are some groups of people often excluded from epistemic
communities like those in academia? And what might we do about
this?</p>

<p>
In recent work, scholars have used models of bargaining to represent
academic collaboration. They have shown 1) how the emergence of
bargaining norms across social identity groups can lead to
discrimination with respect to credit sharing in collaboration (Bruner
and O&rsquo;Connor 2017; O&rsquo;Connor and Bruner 2019) and 2) why
this may lead some groups to avoid academia, or else cluster in
certain subfields (Rubin and O&rsquo;Connor 2018). In the
credit-economy tradition, Bright (2017b) explains why a noted
phenomenon&mdash;that women tend to publish fewer papers than
men&mdash;may not indicate a gap in quality of research. As he points
out, anticipation of rejection may lead women to overshoot by
producing papers of higher quality than necessary for publication.
This gap contributes to the underrepresentation of women in some
disciplines.</p>

<p>
As we have seen in this section, models can help explain how and when
cognitive diversity might matter to the production of knowledge by a
community. They can also tell us something about why epistemic
communities often, nonetheless, fail to be diverse with respect to
social identity.</p>

<h2 id="SociEpisSoci">5. Social Epistemology and Society</h2>

<p>
Let us now move on to see how topics from social epistemology
intersect with important questions about the proper functioning of
democratic societies, and questions about the ethics of social
knowledge and learning.</p>

<h3 id="TrutSeekPursDemo">5.1 Truth-Seeking in the Pursuit of Democracy </h3>

<p>
In our portrayal of social epistemology thus far, several different
mosaics have been sketched. In some cases, a single epistemic agent
seeks epistemic help from another agent. In other cases, a collective
agent seeks answers to questions using its members in a collaborative
fashion. A third kind of case, which arose especially in the last
section, is what we shall call a &ldquo;system-oriented&rdquo; or
&ldquo;institution-oriented&rdquo; application of social
epistemology.</p>

<p>
By a &ldquo;system&rdquo; we mean some entity with a multiplicity of
working &ldquo;parts&rdquo; and multiple goals that the system aims to
achieve. A question that arises, quite frequently, is how best to
design a system that will maximize the attainment, or satisfaction, of
its (most important) goals over time. As we have seen, this is a
question that philosophers have attempted to answer with respect to
the structure of scientific communities. Another good example of such
systems are political systems, especially democratic political
systems. There are many current democratic theorists who place much
emphasis on the epistemological, or epistemic, properties of
democratic institutions.</p>

<p>
Elizabeth Anderson (2006) focuses on the question of how the epistemic
properties of democratic systems can be designed to attain the best
possible form of democracy. She provides three epistemic models of
democracy: the Condorcet Jury Theorem, the Diversity Trumps Ability
result, and John Dewey&rsquo;s experimentalism (see Landemore 2011).
Anderson plumps for Dewey&rsquo;s experimentalist approach. He
highlights the importance of bringing together citizens from different
walks of life to define, through discussion, the principal problems
they confront and what might be the most promising solutions. Their
different walks of life constitute, in effect, a range of experiments
that can help them collectively appraise alternative solutions, thus
taking advantage of cognitive diversity. Anderson provides a
convincing illustration of Dewey&rsquo;s thesis by relating how women
in a South Asian village were able to manage their forests better when
they were given opportunities to make fuller use of their
&ldquo;situated knowledge&rdquo; (see Agarwal 2000).</p>

<p>
When we contemplate the meaning of democracy, we often mean (as a
starting point, anyway) a governmental system that features equal
voting rights for all citizens. A little reflection, however, readily
indicates how shallow a role is played by mere voting rights. A
citizen may be entitled to cast a vote for any of the candidates on
the ballot. But this will not help the voter promote positive results
(positive by her lights) if she has misguided views of what specific
candidates for office would do if they were actually elected, or about
what policy measures will be effective (for details, see Goldman 1999:
315&ndash;348).</p>

<p>
This raises the question of just how informed or misinformed ordinary
voters are, and what prospects there are for improving the present
situation. Many political scientists have shown that American voters
are strikingly uninformed with respect to textbook facts about their
government. Nonetheless, there are some rays of light. Several books
argue that ordinary citizens can make sense of their political world
despite a lack of detailed information about policies and candidates
(see Berelson, Lazarsfeld, &amp; McPhee 1954, and Katz &amp;
Lazarsfeld 1955; cited in Goldman 1999). One semi-optimistic idea is
that of a two-step flow of communication from well-informed
&ldquo;opinion leaders&rdquo; to the public at large. This approach
suggests that ordinary citizens&mdash;even those who pay little
attention to the details of politics&mdash;can learn what they need to
know to make suitable choices by listening to the opinions of experts
or news junkies. Cues and informational &ldquo;shortcuts&rdquo; are
available that can lead them to the same answers that more informed
citizens arrive at (cf. Goldman 1999: 318).</p>

<p>
If this account is correct, it suggests that a wide range of citizens
can make fairly &ldquo;accurate&rdquo; voting decisions if two
conditions hold: (1) there are political experts whose knowledge
enables them to pinpoint who would be good electoral choices relative
to specifiable citizens; and (2) these initially less-informed
citizens are capable of identifying who are (some of) the genuine
experts and who are not. An ability to recognize genuine expertise in
political matters can play a significant role in promoting the kind of
democratic success described above. As noted, though, it can be
difficult for laypeople to decide which experts to trust. And as we
saw in the last section, in our discussion of industrial influence on
public belief, there are forces that work to undermine the functioning
of democracy, and that often bring us away from this more optimistic
picture. In the next section we will briefly discuss some related
issues.</p>

<h3 id="MisiInte">5.2 Misinformation on the Internet </h3>

<p>
The latest challenge confronting the informational state of the public
is the accelerating spread of misinformation and disinformation on the
internet. On Twitter falsehoods spread further and faster than the
truth (Temming 2018a,b). In the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential
election, the most popular bogus articles got more Facebook shares,
reactions, and comments than the top real-news stories, according to a
BuzzFeed News analysis. And, as many have documented, online
misinformation and disinformation in a wide variety of forms have
created serious issues <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em> public belief and
democratic functioning.</p>

<p>
In trying to tackle the spread of misinformation, many online
platforms have implemented algorithms. For instance, in response to
&ldquo;fake news&rdquo;, programmers have built automated systems that
aim to judge the veracity of online stories. Researchers explore which
features of an article are the most reliable identifiers of fake news
(Temming 2018b: 24). Clearly, these sorts of tools have some promise
as part of the enterprise of social epistemology. But their power to
discriminate true stories from false ones still has limited
reliability. Furthermore, as O&rsquo;Connor and Weatherall (2019)
point out (drawing on the work of Holman (2015) who looks at arms
races between pharmaceutical companies and regulators) online
misinformation constitutes a kind of arms race. As platforms and
programmers and governments develop tools to fight it, the purveyors
of misinformation (the Russian state, various partisan groups,
advertisers, trolls, etc.) will develop new methods of shaping public
belief.</p>

<p>
All ill-informed populace, as noted, may not be able to effectively
represent their interests in a democratic society. In order to protect
democratic functioning, going forward it will be necessary for those
fighting online misinformation to keep adapting with the best tools
and theory available to them. This includes understanding social
aspects of knowledge and belief formation. In other words, social
epistemology has much to say to those faced with the challenging task
of protecting democracy from misinformation.</p>

<h3 id="MoraSociEpis">5.3 Moral Social Epistemology </h3>

<p>
Some recent writers seek to expand the notion of social epistemology
by incorporating moral or ethical elements. Miranda Fricker (2007) in
particular has made significant contributions to this literature.
Fricker introduces the notion of &ldquo;epistemic injustice,&rdquo;
which arises when somebody is wronged in their capacity as a knower.
An easily recognizable form of such injustice is when a person or a
social group is unfairly deprived of knowledge because of their lack
of adequate access to education or other epistemic resources.
Fricker&rsquo;s work also focuses on two less obvious forms of
epistemic injustice. The first is <em>testimonial injustice</em>,
which occurs when a speaker is given less credibility than she
deserves because the hearer has prejudices about a social group to
which the speaker belongs. The second kind is <em>hermeneutical
injustice</em>. This occurs when, as a result of a group being
socially powerless, members of the group lack the conceptual resources
to make sense of certain distinctive social experiences. For instance,
before the 1970s, victims of sexual harassment had trouble
understanding and describing the behavior of which they were the
victims, because the concept had not yet been articulated. Christopher
Hookway (2010) builds on Fricker&rsquo;s work and argues that there
are other forms of epistemic injustice that do not involve testimony
or conceptual resources</p>

<p>
These issues are relevant epistemological ones for those in democratic
societies. Epistemic injustices may leave some members of society
ill-equipped to engage in the debates that fuel a well-functioning
democracy. Testimonial injustice may prevent the spread of important
information and perspectives through a community.</p>

<p>
As we saw in the last section, misinformation can also pose epistemic
threats to democratic functioning. With respect to internet
misinformation, we might ask: do we have a right to protection against
such misinformation? Is it morally acceptable, or even morally
mandatory, for internet platforms, or government bodies, to protect
public belief by regulating and limiting misinformation? There are
deep political and moral issues here that we cannot possibly cover in
this entry. But we will note a fundamental tension that is relevant.
Free speech is protected in most democratic societies, but part of the
defense of free speech by thinkers like Mill (1859 [1966]) is that it
is crucial for freedom of thought. Once we recognize that human
beliefs are deeply social, and do not always follow Descartes&rsquo;
model of the individual, fully rational reasoner, we might acknowledge
that some sorts of speech interfere with our freedom of thought, and
in some cases we may need to decide to protect one in lieu of the
other.</p>

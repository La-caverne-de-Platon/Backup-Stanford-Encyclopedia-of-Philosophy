<h3><a id="desc"></a>Brief Description</h3>
<p>
 Welcome to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP), which as of
March 2018, has nearly 1600 entries online.  From its inception, the
SEP was designed so that each entry is maintained and kept up-to-date
by an expert or group of experts in the field. All entries and
substantive updates are refereed by the members of a distinguished
 <a href="board.html">Editorial Board</a>
 before they are made public. Consequently, our dynamic reference work
maintains academic standards while evolving and adapting in response
to new research. You can cite fixed editions that are created on a
quarterly basis and stored in our 
 <a href="archives/index.html">Archives</a> (every entry contains a
link to its complete archival history, identifying the fixed edition
the reader should cite). The
 <a href="contents.html">Table of Contents</a>
 lists entries that are published or assigned.  The
 <a href="projected-contents.html">Projected Table of Contents</a>
 also lists entries which are currently unassigned but nevertheless
projected.</p>

<h3><a id="pubmod"></a>The SEP's Publishing Model</h3>

<p>
 The combination of features exhibited by the SEP publishing model
distinguishes it from other attempts to build scholarly resources on
the web.  Our open access model has the following features: (1) a
password-protected web interface for authors, which allows them to
download entry templates, submit private drafts for review, and
remotely edit/update their entries; (2) a password-protected web
interface for the subject editors, which allows them to add new
topics, commission new entries, referee unpublished entries and
updates (updates can be displayed with the original and updated
versions side-by-side <em>with the differences highlighted</em>) and
accept/reject entries and revisions; (3) a secure administrative web
interface for the principal editor, by which the entire collaborative
process can be managed with a very small staff (the principal editor
can add people, add entries, assign entries to editors, issue
invitations, track deadlines, publish entries and updates, etc.); (4)
a tracking system which logs the actions taken at the web interfaces,
monitors the state of every entry, determines who owes work and when,
automatically sends occasional, friendly email reminders, and provides
a summary to the principal editor; (5) software which dynamically
cross-references the SEP when new entries are published, and which
periodically checks for broken links throughout the content; (6)
software which automatically creates an archive every quarter,
providing the proper basis for scholarly citation; and (7) mirror
sites at universities in other parts of the world, which provide
faster access to readers worldwide, provide access when the Stanford
server is down for maintenance, and safeguard the digital content as
extra backups.  The SEP's publishing model therefore has the ability
to deliver, with very low administrative and production costs, quality
content meeting the highest of academic standards via a medium that is
universally accessible.</p>

<p>
 Few dynamic reference works have been built to the specifications
described in the previous paragraph.  Most of the other encyclopedia
projects available on the web lack some of the dynamic and scholarly
features of the SEP. Either they (a) are costly and behind a
subscription wall, invisible to search engines and so not as useful to
academics and the general public; or (b) don't have an administrative
system capable of screening new entries and updates prior to
publication and ensuring that entries are responsive to new research;
or (c) don't allow the authors/editors to directly contact the server
to update/referee the content of the entries; or (d) lack a system of
archives for stable, scholarly citation (thus, when entries change,
the old content is just lost, and any citations to, or quotations
from, prior content become impossible to verify); or (e) lack a
university-based Advisory Board to vet the members of its Editorial
Board.</p>

<p>
  The SEP's model may therefore represent a unique digital library
concept: a scholarly dynamic reference work.  A scholarly dynamic
reference work differs from an academic journal, for academic journals
(1) do not typically update the articles they publish, (2) do not aim
to publish articles on a comprehensive set of topics, but rather, for
the most part, publish articles that are randomly submitted by the
members of the profession, (3) do not aim to cross-reference and
create links among the concepts used in the articles they publish, (4)
typically serve a narrow audience of specialists, and (5) do not have
to deal with the <em>asynchronous</em> activity of updating,
refereeing, and tracking separate deadlines for entries, since they
are published on a <em>synchronized</em> schedule.  Moreover, our
reference work differs from preprint exchanges, for the latter not
only exhibit features (1), (2), (3), and (4) just mentioned, but also
do not referee their publications and so need not incorporate a
work-flow system that handles the asynchronous refereeing process that
occurs between upload and publication in a dynamic reference work.
None of this is to say that electronic journals and preprint exchanges
have a faulty design, but rather that a scholarly dynamic reference
work is a distinctive new kind of publication that represents a unique
digital library concept.</p>

<h3><a id="hist"></a>History</h3>

<p>
 The SEP project began in September 1995 when
 <a href="https://www-csli.stanford.edu/people/perry-john" target="other">John Perry</a>
 was the Director of the Center for the Study of Language and
Information (CSLI).  Perry's suggestion that CSLI enhance its web presence
by creating a (static) online dictionary of philosophy was taken up by
 <a href="http://mally.stanford.edu/zalta.html" target="other">Edward N. Zalta</a>,
 who developed the idea into that of a dynamic reference work.
Zalta then started designing the SEP to be an online encyclopedia
that would satisfy the highest academic standards.  After two years of
support from CSLI, our prototype became a proof of concept that earned
the first of a series of successful grant applications. (See the
 <a href="#grants">History of Grants</a>
 below.) The addition of
 <a href="http://colinallen.dnsalias.org/" target="other">Colin Allen</a>
 and 
 <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~nodelman/" target="other">Uri Nodelman</a> 
 to the project in 1998 resulted in significant enhancements to the
design and implementation of our new academic publishing model.  They
introduced browser-based file-upload, workflow principles that
categorized the state of every entry and possible state transitions,
remote HTML editing, an engine which compares an original and revised
entry side-by-side in the browser with the differences highlighted,
etc. 
 <a href="http://pdaniell.org/" target="other">Paul Daniell</a>
 programmed/developed the new search engine that the
SEP brought online in September 2006. The SEP project
moved to the Department of Philosophy in September 2021.</p>

<h3><a id="ack"></a>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>
 The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is indebted to many people,
both at Stanford and elsewhere, who have supported the efforts of the
project in significant ways.  First, and foremost, we'd like to thank
Professor John Perry, who has served as the principal investigator on
the SEP grants, provided high-level supervision on the project, serves
as the SEP's advocate to the Stanford administration, and gave
generously of his time in SEP fund-raising activities. After Perry
served as the SEP's Faculty Sponsor for many years, the role finally
turned over first to Helen Longino, and then to R. Lanier
Anderson.</p>

<h4><a name="AdmAssist">Administrative Assistance</a></h4> 

<p>The SEP would like to acknowledge significant support from the
Administrative Staff of the Center for the Study of Language and
Information (CSLI) from Fall 1995 (when the SEP project started)
through Fall 2021, when it moved to the Department of
Philosophy. We especially thank
<a href="https://www-csli.stanford.edu/people/amita-kumar" target="other">Amita Kumar</a>
and
<a href="https://www-csli.stanford.edu/people/michelle-lodwick" target="other">Michelle Lodwick</a>
for their tireless efforts on behalf of the SEP. The project would not
be what it is today without their work.</p>

<h4>Editorial Assistance</h4>

<p>

The SEP would also like to thank the following people: Nathan Tawil,
Paul E. Oppenheimer, Jesse Alama, Ben Wolfson, Tamar Lando, Matthew
Barrett, and Arezoo Islami have provided, and in some cases continue
to provide, valuable editorial and document-editing assistance.
Kirsta Anderson (M.A./Philosophy) served as Assistant Editor during
the 2003&ndash;2004 academic year, and did an outstanding job in SEP
communications and control, offering many suggestions on how to
improve our workflow system.  Also, Daniel McKenzie served as
Assistant Editor during the 2004&ndash;2005 academic year, and did a
great job juggling communications/control and copy-editing.  Others,
including Matthew Barrett and Justin Pront, have helped on a smaller
scale with SEP editorial duties.  Benjamin Patrick Przybocki also
helped convert entries to HTML/MathJax.</p>

<h4>Fund-Raising Assistance</h4>

<p>
  We are especially indebted to Patrick Byrne (Ph.D., Stanford, 1995)
and The Byrne Foundation for a large and generous gift to the SEP,
creating the John Perry Fund. The John Perry Fund forms an important
part of the SEP's endowment.  We are also deeply indebted to Michelle
Wachs (J.D., Harvard, 1993) of Giving Solutions, whose tireless and
enthusiastic efforts as the SEP's fund-raising consultant during the
2005&ndash;2006 and 2006&ndash;2007 academic years helped us achieve
our fund-raising goals for those years.  We were able to hire Michelle
with funds from a generous grant by the Hewlett Foundation.  We would
also like to acknowledge the contribution of Javier Ergueta (M.B.A.,
Stanford, 1980), for his efforts and work in developing a business
plan for the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy during the first six
months of 2002.  Javier's time was paid for through a generous grant
by the Mellon Foundation.  Thanks go the following students in John
Perry's Fall 2004 Proseminar, for their help and assistance in
implementing an important element of the SEP's fund-raising plan: Dan
Giberman, Tomohiro Hoshi, Alistair Isaac, Daniel Long, Lindsay
McLeary, Sarah Paul, Josh Snyder, Quayshawn Spencer and Johanna
Wolff.</p>

<h4>Programming Assistance</h4>

 <p>
 The Associate Editor (Colin Allen) and the Senior Editor (Uri
Nodelman) have been the Principal and Associate Perl Programmers,
respectively, on this project since 1998. 
 <a href="http://pdaniell.org/" target="other">Paul Daniell</a> not only
developed a customized search engine for the SEP, but
also developed the software that administers the
 <a href="https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/">Friends of the SEP
 Society</a>.  During the 2007&ndash;2008 and 2008&ndash;2009 years,
 Jesse Alama has contributed his programming skills, in addition to
 his document editing skills.  Eric Hammer (Expedia.com) programmed on
 the project in its early years, from 1995 to 1997.  During the
 2000&ndash;2001 and 2001&ndash;2002 academic years, David James
 Anderson (M.A./Philosophy) wrote important Perl programs and made
 other contributions to the project. We'd also like to thank John
 MacFarlane for developing a program that produces PDF versions of SEP
 entries in two-column landscape mode. </p>

<h4>Web Design Assistance</h4>

<p>In March 2014, the SEP launched a new website design. We are
indebted to the team at
 <a href="https://swsblog.stanford.edu/about-stanford-web-services" target="other">Stanford Web Services</a>,
and especially Sara Worrell-Berg, Megan Miller, Anna Cobb, and Brian
Young.  They did a terrific job with the new design. In this
connection, we are also indebted to Scott Stocker, Zach Chandler, Lisa
Lapin, and John Etchemendy, for playing a role and helping to
facilitate this initiative.</p>

<h4>New Technologies Assistance</h4>

<p>
The <em>Encyclopedia</em>
would like acknowledge and thank the researchers and programmers
who are contributing to SEP-enhancement initiatives being pursued by the
<a href="https://www.inphoproject.org/" target="other">Internet Philosophy Ontology project</a>
(InPhO), directed by Colin Allen.  Special thanks go to:

the InPhO project is enhancing such critical functions as cross-referencing
the SEP, classifying topics, and organizing its bibliographic database. We also
indebted to the InPhO team for hosting a backup server for the SEP.</p>

We are grateful for the 
 <a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> project which we are now 
starting to use for mathematical formatting in our entries.
And we would also like to acknowledge 
  <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/" target="other">John MacFarlane</a>'s

  <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>, which has become an 
important part of our workflow in converting LaTeX document to HTML
with MathJax.

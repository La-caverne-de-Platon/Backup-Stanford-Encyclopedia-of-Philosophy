<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">The Kyoto School</a></h2>

<div id="note-1"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Japanese names
are written here in the Japanese order of family name first, followed
by given name. Exceptions are in the cases of Masao Abe
(Abe Masao in Japanese) and D. T. Suzuki (Suzuki Daisetsu in Japanese),
who write their given names first for their publications in Western
languages.</p></div>

<div id="note-2"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Keeping in mind
that all the Kyoto School thinkers drew inspiration from multiple
religious traditions, it is nevertheless possible to see the School's
generations of chair holders at Kyoto University as loosely alternating
between primarily Zen Buddhism (Z) oriented thinkers and primarily Shin
Buddhism (S) oriented thinkers: Nishida (Z and also S); Tanabe (S); Hisamatsu
Shinichi and Nishitani Keiji (Z); Takeuchi Yoshinori (S); Tsujimura
K&#333;ichi and Ueda Shizuteru (Z); Hase Sh&#333;t&#333; and Keta
Masako (S).</p></div>

<div id="note-3"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>  Frederick Franck's edited
volume, <em>The Buddha Eye: An Anthology of the Kyoto School</em>
(2004, first edition 1982), is often singled out for criticism in this
regard. While the book certainly provides us with an important
anthology of modern Japanese religious philosophy, it is misleading to
portray the Shin Buddhist thinkers Kiyozawa Manshi and Soga
Ry&#333;jin, and the Zen master Kobori S&#333;haku Nanrei, as members
of the Kyoto School. D. T. Suzuki is also normally not included under
strict definitions of the Kyoto School.</p></div>

<div id="note-4"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>  There are other shared
pivotal ideas of the Kyoto School that could have been chosen.  For
example, one could focus on the search for a new logic: a logic of
&ldquo;the self-identity of absolute contradictories,&rdquo; a
&ldquo;logic of <em>soku-hi</em> (is and is not),&rdquo; or an
&ldquo;absolute dialectic.&rdquo; Or one could focus on the idea of
&ldquo;self-awakening&rdquo; or &ldquo;self-awareness&rdquo;
(<em>jikaku</em>), which is not the self-consciousness of a subjective
ego but rather a &ldquo;seeing without a seer,&rdquo; an
&ldquo;action-intuition,&rdquo; or the non-dualistic awareness of a
&ldquo;self that is not a self.&rdquo; Alternatively, one could focus
on the manner in which many of the Kyoto School thinkers radically
problematize the relation between &ldquo;philosophy&rdquo; and
&ldquo;religion,&rdquo; that is to say, the way their thought calls
into question accustomed ways of thinking the relation between reason
and thought on the one hand, and experience, practice, and faith on
the other. For the purposes of this article, however, I think it best
to focus on what is generally accepted as the major philosophical
thesis and theme of the Kyoto School: their idea, or rather ideas, of
absolute nothingness.</p></div>

<div id="note-5"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Plato's
highest Form, that of the Good, is said to be &ldquo;beyond
being&rdquo; (see <em>The Republic</em> 509b). Plotinus interprets
Plato's Good as &ldquo;the One,&rdquo; but for him this is not
only beyond being but also beyond all form as such. In this respect,
at least, as well as in the idea that the soul too must become formless
in order to return to this formless One beyond being, Plotinus'
One is closer than Plato's Good to some of the Kyoto
School's ideas of absolute nothingness (however, see section 3.4
below for Tanabe's critique of Nishida's alleged affinity
with Plotinus, and for Nishida's response to this critique). The
following comment by Paul Friedl&auml;nder on the difference between
Plotinus and Plato is revealing in this context: &ldquo;That the
Highest must be without form or shape, that the soul must become
formless in order to comprehend it&mdash;there is nothing like this in
Plato. &hellip; It never did or could enter the mind of Plato, a
citizen of so form-conscious a world, to let the soul be dissolved in
formlessness&rdquo; (Friedl&auml;nder 1969, 83).</p></div>

<div id="note-6"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>  Nishitani reportedly
admitted much later in conversation with Graham Parkes that &ldquo;the
parallels between Nietzsche's thinking and his own run farther than he
was prepared to allow in <em>Religion and Nothingness</em>&rdquo;
(Parkes 1996, 381; see also Parkes 1984). For my own treatment of
Nishitani's sympathetic critique of Nietzsche, see Davis 2011a.  For a
defense of Heidegger from Nishitani's critique, and a reading that
sees a great deal of harmony in their thoughts of nothingness, see
Dallmayr 1993. It is hardly
surprising that Heidegger would show a keen interest in East Asian
thought, given that he wished to think being understood
as <em>das Nichts</em>, which he felt was unthinkable within the
Western tradition of philosophy as onto-theology. For my own treatment of the resonances and differences
between Heidegger's and the Kyoto School's Zen understanding of
nothingness, see Davis 2013d. See also Parkes 1987;
Buchner 1989; and Denker et al. 2013</p></div>

<div id="note-7"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>  A full explication of
the different notions of <em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em> in the
various schools of Mah&#257;y&#257;na philosophy, and an investigation
into their relation to the Kyoto School's philosophies of absolute
nothingness, are tasks that lie beyond the scope of this article. It
would be fruitful to compare, for example, the early Nishida's
philosophy of pure experience and his later philosophy of the
enveloping place of absolute nothingness, not only with the
M&#257;dhamaka stress on the emptiness of any self-subsistent
&ldquo;own-being&rdquo; in individual entities, and hence the
emptiness of linguistic concepts that inevitably isolate and reify and
thus fail to grasp things, but also with the Yog&#257;c&#257;ra idea
of <em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em> as the emptiness of the subject/object
distinction in the enlightened experience of the flow of dependent
origination, and with the Tath&#257;gatagarbha idea of
<em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em> as the emptiness of defilements, that
is, as an expression for the original purity of the Buddha-womb or
Buddha-nature. For a good introduction to these Mah&#257;y&#257;na
schools, see Williams 1989. For an engaging introduction to
philosophical Daoism, see Moeller 2004. It should be noted, however,
that Moeller critically downplays the Wang Bi metaphysical
interpretation of the Daoist <em>wu</em> (according to which
nothingness is an infinite and ineffable source of finite beings; see
Wagner 2003), while it is this influential traditional interpretation
that presumably exerted a significant influence on the topological
metaphysics of <em>mu</em> in at least Nishida's middle period
writings. For an intriguing investigation into Nishida's study of classical Chinese philosophy and the influence it exerted on his thought, see Dalissier 2009. For a lucid and insightful introduction to the
M&#257;dhamaka and Daoist philosophies of
<em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em> and <em>wu</em>, and to their
synthetic developments in the Zen tradition, see Kasulis 1981. For my
own attempt to elucidate the various interrelated yet distinct senses
of emptiness in Zen Buddhism, with references to Kyoto School
philosophies, see Davis 2013a.</p></div>

<div id="note-8"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 In his helpful
remarks on the Eastern intellectual history behind the Kyoto
School's idea of absolute nothingness, Whalen Lai writes:
&ldquo;Of the eighteen forms of <em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em>
(emptiness) in Mah&#257;y&#257;na, two have captured the Chinese
imagination more than the others:
<em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em>-<em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em> (the
emptiness of emptiness, a double negation that reaffirms the real); and
<em>atyanta</em>-<em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em> &hellip; or
&lsquo;ultimate emptiness&rsquo;. The latter is a total Emptiness all
around, and in that sense, is a precursor to [the Kyoto School's]
absolute nothingness&rdquo; (Lai 1990, 258). Indeed, if the notion of
<em>atyanta</em>-<em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em> can be seen as a
precursor to its topological aspect, the notion of
<em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em>-<em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em> can be
understood to prefigure the dialectical and kenotic (self-emptying)
aspect of the Kyoto School's absolute nothingness.</p></div>

<div id="note-9"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 I hyphenate
&ldquo;in-finite&rdquo; here to stress that the <em>infinite</em>
nothingness of the Dao is found only <em>in the midst of</em> the
natural flow of finite things. Mah&#257;y&#257;na notions of
<em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em> (as
<em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em>-<em>&#347;&#363;nyat&#257;</em>) and
the Kyoto School notions of absolute nothingness can be said to share
this double sense of &ldquo;in-finity.&rdquo; In other words, the truly
infinite is found only in the very midst of the finite.</p></div>

<div id="note-10"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>  Some scholars prefer
to translate &ldquo;<em>basho</em>&rdquo; as &ldquo;locus&rdquo; or
&ldquo;topos.&rdquo; Along with Plato's
<em>chora</em> as the &ldquo;receptacle of forms&rdquo;
(<em>Timaeus</em> 49; see NKZ IV, 209, 315; NKZ XI, 73) and
Aristotle's soul as the &ldquo;<em>topos</em> of forms&rdquo; (<em>De
Anima</em> 429a.15; see NKZ IV, 213), Nishida makes reference to
Husserl's notions of &ldquo;region&rdquo; (<em>Region</em>) and the
&ldquo;field of consciousness&rdquo; (<em>Bewusstseinsfeld</em>) in
working out his own idea of place (<em>basho</em>) (see NKZ IV, 210).
Since for Nishida the place of absolute nothingness completely enfolds
both subjective (noetic) and objective (noematic) polarities, he comes
to view Husserl's phenomenological notion of the <em>Region</em> as
implying only its noetic aspect (see NKZ V: 237). For a detailed
account of these and other philosophical sources that Nishida
critically appropriated when developing his logic of <em>basho</em>,
see Jacinto 2001.</p></div>

<div id="note-11"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>  An English
translation of &ldquo;Basho&rdquo; is available in Nishida 2012a. For a German
translation, see Elberfeld 1999. For studies of Nishida's logic of
place, see Wargo 2005 and Krummel 2012. For other studies of Nishida's
philosophy in English, see Carter 1997, Wilkinson 2009 (also see Davis
2011d), Maraldo 2011, and Krummel 2015.</p></div>

<div id="note-12"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 For an argument that Nishida's philosophy of
&ldquo;self-awareness&rdquo; precludes a genuine relationship with the
interpersonal other, see Heisig 2001, 82&ndash;83; for a response, see Davis 2002,
158ff., and Davis 2014.</p></div>

<div id="note-13"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 More
recently, Masao Abe was an outspoken proponent of the idea of the
<em>kenosis</em> or &ldquo;self-emptying&rdquo; of God as absolute
nothingness. While Abe inherits this interpretation of <em>kenosis</em>
from Nishida and Nishitani (see NKZ XI, 398&ndash;99; NKC X, 65;
Nishitani 1982, 59), he provocatively develops it in dialogue and
debate with leading Western theologians and philosophers of religion
(see Cobb/Ives 1990; Ives 1995).</p></div>

<div id="note-14"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Takeuchi
Yoshinori understands Tanabe's thought to have gone through three
transitions with regard to the question of the relation of philosophy
to religion (see Takeuchi 1999, Vol. 5, 47&ndash;65). According to
James Heisig's explication, Takeuchi &ldquo;lays out three
patterns for the philosophy of religion: a clear separation of the
religious experience from philosophical reflection, the pursuit of a
kind of thinking which sees philosophical thinking as at the same time
belonging to religious experience, and the search for a unity in the
tension between these two positions. These three patterns are then
shown to represent transitions in Tanabe's own philosophy&rdquo;
(Heisig 2001, 324&ndash;25).</p></div>

<div id="note-15"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 On
Nishitani's three-field topology of the step back through
nihilism, see Davis 2004a, 155ff.</p></div>

<div id="note-16"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 In an
uncharacteristic mistranslation Arisaka renders the phrase &ldquo;our
world&rdquo; as &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; giving the passage a far more
ethnocentric meaning (see Arisaka 1999, 242).</p></div>

<div id="note-17"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 In other
words, Nishida would be accused of promulgating a Japanese version of
what Derrida criticizes as the &ldquo;logic of the example&rdquo; used
by Eurocentric universalists such as Husserl, according to which Europe is the
particular that reveals the universal, the example that manifests the
rule (see Derrida 1992).</p></div>

<div id="note-18"><p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>  It should be kept in
mind that both of these assertions mirror ones frequently made in
&ldquo;the West,&rdquo; which has&mdash;as Edward Said and other
critics of &ldquo;Orientalism&rdquo; have
demonstrated&mdash;maintained its own identity and sense of
superiority in large part by positing an ultimately degrading image of
its &ldquo;Other&rdquo; as &ldquo;the East&rdquo; or &ldquo;the
Orient&rdquo; (see Said 1978 and 1993). For example, the idea that one
culture can provide the place toward which all cultures are to
progress also appears in the claim that American style liberal
democracy and free-market capitalism mark the teleological &ldquo;end
of history&rdquo; (see Fukuyama 1992). It is also found in the claim
that the true evolution of society lies in finishing the
&ldquo;unfinished project of [Western] modernity,&rdquo; which
involves articulating universal rules of discourse for communication
between cultures (Habermas 1979). It is also paradoxically found in
the claim that &ldquo;unity in diversity,&rdquo; not imperialistic
hegemony, is the &ldquo;true heritage of Europe,&rdquo; a heritage
that needs to be &ldquo;spread to all cultures around the world&rdquo;
(Gadamer 1989; also see Gadamer's statement quoted in Dallmayr 1996,
xiii).</p></div>

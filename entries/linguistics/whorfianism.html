<h2>Whorfianism</h2>

<p>
Emergentists tend to follow Edward Sapir in taking an interest in
interlinguistic and intralinguistic variation. Linguistic
anthropologists have explicitly taken up the task of defending a
famous claim associated with Sapir that connects linguistic variation
to differences in thinking and cognition more generally. The claim is
very often referred to as the <strong>Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis</strong>
(though this is a largely infelicitous label, as we shall see).</p>

<p>
This topic is closely related to various forms of
relativism&mdash;epistemological, ontological, conceptual, and
moral&mdash;and its general outlines are discussed elsewhere in this
encyclopedia; see the section on language in the Summer 2015 archived
version of the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/relativism/index.html#3.1">relativism</a>
 (&sect;3.1). Cultural versions of moral relativism suggest that,
given how much cultures differ, what is moral for you might depend on
the culture you were brought up in. A somewhat analogous view would
suggest that, given how much language structures differ, what is
thinkable for you might depend on the language you use. (This is
actually a kind of conceptual relativism, but it is generally called
linguistic relativism, and we will continue that practice.)</p>

<p>
Even a brief skim of the vast literature on the topic is not remotely
plausible in this article; and the primary literature is in any case
more often polemical than enlightening. It certainly holds no general
answer to what science has discovered about the influences of language
on thought. Here we offer just a limited discussion of the alleged
hypothesis and the rhetoric used in discussing it, the vapid and not
so vapid forms it takes, and the prospects for actually devising
testable scientific hypotheses about the influence of language on
thought.</p>

<p>
Whorf himself did not offer a hypothesis. He presented his &ldquo;new
principle of linguistic relativity&rdquo; (Whorf 1956: 214) as a fact
discovered by linguistic analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
When linguists became able to examine critically and scientifically a
large number of languages of widely different patterns, their base of
reference was expanded; they experienced an interruption of phenomena
hitherto held universal, and a whole new order of significances came
into their ken. It was found that the background linguistic system (in
other words, the grammar) of each language is not merely a reproducing
instrument for voicing ideas but rather is itself the shaper of ideas,
the program and guide for the individual&rsquo;s mental activity, for
his analysis of impressions, for his synthesis of his mental stock in
trade. Formulation of ideas is not an independent process, strictly
rational in the old sense, but is part of a particular grammar, and
differs, from slightly to greatly, between different grammars. We
dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages. The
categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do
not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the
contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscopic flux of
impressions which has to be organized by our minds&mdash;and this
means largely by the linguistic systems in our minds. We cut nature
up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do,
largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this
way&mdash;an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and
is codified in the patterns of our language. The agreement is, of
course, an implicit and unstated one, but 
<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">its terms are absolutely obligatory</span>;
 we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the
organization and classification of data which the agreement decrees.
(Whorf 1956: 212&ndash;214; emphasis in original)
</blockquote>

<p>
Later, Whorf&rsquo;s speculations about the &ldquo;sensuously and
operationally different&rdquo; character of different snow types for
&ldquo;an Eskimo&rdquo; (Whorf 1956: 216) developed into a familiar
journalistic meme about the Inuit having dozens or scores or hundreds
of words for snow; but few who repeat that urban legend recall
Whorf&rsquo;s emphasis on its being grammar, rather than lexicon, that
cuts up and organizes nature for us.</p>

<p>
In an article written in 1937, posthumously published in an academic
journal (Whorf 1956: 87&ndash;101), Whorf clarifies what is most
important about the effects of language on thought and world-view. He
distinguishes &lsquo;phenotypes&rsquo;, which are overt grammatical
categories typically indicated by morphemic markers, from what he
called &lsquo;cryptotypes&rsquo;, which are covert grammatical
categories, marked only implicitly by distributional patterns in a
language that are not immediately apparent. In English, the past tense
would be an example of a phenotype (it is marked by the -<i>ed</i>
suffix in all regular verbs). Gender in personal names and common
nouns would be an example of a cryptotype, not systematically marked
by anything. In a cryptotype, &ldquo;class membership of the word is
not apparent until there is a question of using it or referring to it
in one of these special types of sentence, and then we find that this
word belongs to a class requiring some sort of distinctive treatment,
which may even be the negative treatment of excluding that type of
sentence&rdquo; (p. 89).</p>

<p>
Whorf&rsquo;s point is the familiar one that linguistic structure is
comprised, in part, of distributional patterns in language use that
are not explicitly marked. What follows from this, according to Whorf,
is not that the existing lexemes in a language (like its words for
snow) comprise covert linguistic structure, but that patterns shared
by word classes constitute linguistic structure. In &lsquo;Language,
mind, and reality&rsquo; (1942; published posthumously in
<em>Theosophist</em>, a magazine published in India for the followers
of the 19th-century spiritualist Helena Blavatsky) he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
Because of the systematic, configurative nature of higher mind, the
&ldquo;patternment&rdquo; aspect of language always overrides and
controls the &ldquo;lexation&rdquo;&hellip;or name-giving aspect.
Hence the meanings of specific words are less important than we fondly
fancy. Sentences, not words, are the essence of speech, just as
equations and functions, and not bare numbers, are the real meat of
mathematics. We are all mistaken in our common belief that any word
has an &ldquo;exact meaning.&rdquo; We have seen that the higher mind
deals in symbols that have no fixed reference to anything, but are
like blank checks, to be filled in as required, that stand for
&ldquo;any value&rdquo; of a given variable, like &hellip;the
<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> of algebra. (Whorf 1942: 258)
</blockquote>

<p>
Whorf apparently thought that only personal and proper names have an
exact meaning or reference (Whorf 1956: 259).</p>

<p>
For Whorf, it was an unquestionable fact that language influences
thought to some degree:</p>

<blockquote>
Actually, thinking is most mysterious, and by far the greatest light
upon it that we have is thrown by the study of language. This study
shows that the forms of a person&rsquo;s thoughts are controlled by
inexorable laws of pattern of which he is unconscious. These patterns
are the unperceived intricate systematizations of his own
language&mdash;shown readily enough by a candid comparison and
contrast with other languages, especially those of a different
linguistic family. His thinking itself is in a language&mdash;in
English, in Sanskrit, in Chinese. [footnote omitted] And every
language is a vast pattern-system, different from others, in which are
culturally ordained the forms and categories by which the personality
not only communicates, but analyzes nature, notices or neglects types
of relationship and phenomena, channels his reasoning, and builds the
house of his consciousness. (Whorf 1956: 252)
</blockquote>

<p>
He seems to regard it as necessarily true that language affects
thought, given</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>the fact that language must be used in order to think, and</li>

<li>the facts about language structure that linguistic analysis
discovers.</li>
</ol>

<p>
He also seems to presume that the only structure and logic that
thought has is grammatical structure. These views are not the ones
that after Whorf&rsquo;s death came to be known as &lsquo;the
Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis&rsquo; (a sobriquet due to Hoijer 1954). Nor
are they what was called the &lsquo;Whorf thesis&rsquo; by Brown and
Lenneberg (1954) which was concerned with the relation of obligatory
lexical distinctions and thought. Brown and Lenneberg (1954)
investigated this question by looking at the relation of color
terminology in a language and the classificatory abilities of the
speakers of that language. The issue of the relation between
obligatory lexical distinctions and thought is at the heart of what is
now called &lsquo;the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis&rsquo; or &lsquo;the
Whorf Hypothesis&rsquo; or &lsquo;Whorfianism&rsquo;.</p>

<h3><a name="BanWho">1. Banal Whorfianism</a></h3>

<p>
No one is going to be impressed with a claim that some aspect of your
language may affect how you think in some way or other; that is
neither a philosophical thesis nor a psychological hypothesis. So it
is appropriate to set aside entirely the kind of so-called hypotheses
that Steven Pinker presents in <em>The Stuff of Thought</em> (2007:
126&ndash;128) as &ldquo;five banal versions of the Whorfian
hypothesis&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>

<li>&ldquo;Language affects thought because we get much of our
knowledge through reading and conversation.&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;A sentence can frame an event, affecting the way people
construe it.&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;The stock of words in a language reflects the kinds of
things its speakers deal with in their lives and hence think
about.&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;[I]f one uses the word language in a loose way to refer to
meanings,&hellip; then language is thought.&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;When people think about an entity, among the many
attributes they can think about is its name.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are just truisms, unrelated to any serious issue about
linguistic relativism.</p>

<p>
We should also set aside some methodological versions of linguistic
relativism discussed in anthropology. It may be excellent advice to a
budding anthropologist to be aware of linguistic diversity, and to be
on the lookout for ways in which your language may affect your
judgment of other cultures; but such advice does not constitute a
hypothesis.</p>

<h3><a name="SoCalSapWhoHyp">2. The so-called Sapir-Whorf hypothesis</a></h3>

<p>
The term &ldquo;Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis&rdquo; was coined by Harry
Hoijer in his contribution (Hoijer 1954) to a conference on the work
of Benjamin Lee Whorf in 1953. But anyone looking in Hoijer&rsquo;s
paper for a clear statement of the hypothesis will look in vain.
Curiously, despite his stated intent &ldquo;to review and clarify the
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis&rdquo; (1954: 93), Hoijer did not even attempt
to state it. The closest he came was this:</p>

<blockquote>
The central idea of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is that language
functions, not simply as a device for reporting experience, but also,
and more significantly, as a way of defining experience for its
speakers.
</blockquote>

<p>
The claim that &ldquo;language functions&hellip;as a way of defining
experience&rdquo; appears to be offered as a kind of vague
metaphysical insight rather than either a statement of linguistic
relativism or a testable hypothesis.</p>

<p>
And if Hoijer seriously meant that what qualitative experiences a
speaker <em>can</em> have are constituted by that speaker&rsquo;s
language, then surely the claim is false. There is no reason to doubt
that non-linguistic sentient creatures like cats can experience (for
example) pain or heat or hunger, so having a language is not a
necessary condition for having experiences. And it is surely not
sufficient either: a robot with a sophisticated natural language
processing capacity could be designed without the capacity for
conscious experience.</p>

<p>
In short, it is a mystery what Hoijer meant by his &ldquo;central
idea&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Vague remarks of the same loosely metaphysical sort have continued to
be a feature of the literature down to the present. The statements
made in some recent papers, even in respected refereed journals,
contain non-sequiturs echoing some of the remarks of Sapir, Whorf, and
Hoijer. And they come from both sides of the debate.</p>

<h3><a name="AntWhoRhe">3. Anti-Whorfian rhetoric</a></h3>

<p>
Lila Gleitman is an Essentialist on the other side of the contemporary
debate: she is against linguistic relativism, and against the broadly
Whorfian work of Stephen Levinson&rsquo;s group at the Max Planck
Institute for Psycholinguistics. In the context of criticizing a
particular research design, Li and Gleitman (2002) quote Whorf&rsquo;s
claim that &ldquo;language is the factor that limits free plasticity
and rigidifies channels of development&rdquo;. But in the claim cited,
Whorf seems to be talking about the psychological topic that holds
universally of human conceptual development, not claiming that
linguistic relativism is true.</p>

<p>
Li and Gleitman then claim (p. 266) that such (Whorfian) views
&ldquo;have diminished considerably in academic favor&rdquo; in part
because of &ldquo;the universalist position of Chomskian linguistics,
with its potential for explaining the striking similarity of language
learning in children all over the world.&rdquo; But there is no clear
conflict or even a conceptual connection between Whorf&rsquo;s views
about language placing limits on developmental plasticity, and
Chomsky&rsquo;s thesis of an innate universal architecture for syntax.
In short, there is no reason why Chomsky&rsquo;s I-languages could not
be innately constrained, but (once acquired) cognitively and
developmentally constraining.</p>

<p>
For example, the supposedly deep linguistic universal of
&lsquo;recursion&rsquo; (Hauser et al. 2002) is surely quite
independent of whether the inventory of colour-name lexemes in your
language influences the speed with which you can discriminate between
color chips. And conversely, universal tendencies in color naming
across languages (Kay and Regier 2006) do <em>not</em> show that
color-naming differences among languages are without effect on
categorical perception (Thierry et al. 2009).</p>

<h3><a name="StrWeaWho">4. Strong and weak Whorfianism</a></h3>

<p>
One of the first linguists to defend a general form of universalism
against linguistic relativism, thus presupposing that they conflict,
was Julia Penn (1972). She was also an early popularizer of the
distinction between &lsquo;strong&rsquo; and &lsquo;weak&rsquo;
formulations of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis (and an opponent of the
&lsquo;strong&rsquo; version).</p>

<p>
&lsquo;Weak&rsquo; versions of Whorfianism state that language
<em>influences</em> or defeasibly shapes thought. &lsquo;Strong&rsquo;
versions state that language <em>determines</em> thought, or fixes it
in some way. The weak versions are commonly dismissed as banal
(because of course there must be <em>some</em> influence), and the
stronger versions as implausible.</p>

<p>
The weak versions are considered banal because they are not adequately
formulated as testable hypotheses that could conflict with relevant
evidence about language and thought.</p>

<p>
Why would the strong versions be thought implausible? For a language
to make us think in a particular way, it might seem that it must at
least temporarily prevent us from thinking in other ways, and thus
make some thoughts not only inexpressible but unthinkable. If this
were true, then strong Whorfianism would conflict with the Katzian
effability claim. There would be thoughts that a person couldn&rsquo;t
think because of the language(s) they speak.</p>

<p>
Some are fascinated by the idea that there are inaccessible thoughts;
and the notion that learning a new language gives access to entirely
new thoughts and concepts seems to be a staple of popular writing
about the virtues of learning languages. But many scientists and
philosophers intuitively rebel against violations of effability:
thinking about concepts that no one has yet named is part of their job
description.</p>

<p>
The resolution lies in seeing that the language could <em>affect
certain aspects of our cognitive functioning without making certain
thoughts unthinkable for us</em>.</p>

<p>
For example, Greek has separate terms for what we call light blue and
dark blue, and no word meaning what &lsquo;blue&rsquo; means in
English: Greek forces a choice on this distinction. Experiments have
shown (Thierry et al. 2009) that native speakers of Greek react faster
when categorizing light blue and dark blue color
chips&mdash;apparently a genuine effect of language on thought. But
that does not make English speakers blind to the distinction, or imply
that Greek speakers cannot grasp the idea of a hue falling somewhere
between green and violet in the spectrum.</p>

<p>
There is no general or global ineffability problem. There is, though,
a peculiar aspect of strong Whorfian claims, giving them a local
analog of ineffability: the content of such a claim <em>cannot be
expressed in any language it is true of</em>. This does not make the
claims self-undermining (as with the standard objections to
relativism); it doesn&rsquo;t even mean that they are untestable. They
are somewhat anomalous, but nothing follows concerning the speakers of
the language in question (except that they cannot state the hypothesis
using the basic vocabulary and grammar that they ordinarily use).</p>

<p>
If there were a true hypothesis about the limits that basic English
vocabulary and constructions puts on what English speakers can think,
the hypothesis would turn out to be inexpressible in English, using
basic vocabulary and the usual repertoire of constructions. That might
mean it would be hard for us to discuss it in an article in English
unless we used terminological innovations or syntactic workarounds.
But that doesn&rsquo;t imply anything about English speakers&rsquo;
ability to grasp concepts, or to develop new ways of expressing them
by coining new words or elaborated syntax.</p>

<h3><a name="ConEvaWhoHyp">5. Constructing and evaluating Whorfian hypotheses</a></h3>

<p>
A number of considerations are relevant to formulating, testing, and
evaluating Whorfian hypotheses.</p>

<p>
Genuine hypotheses about the effects of language on thought will
always have a duality: there will be a linguistic part and a
non-linguistic one. The linguistic part will involve a claim that some
feature is present in one language but absent in another.</p>

<p>
Whorf himself saw that it was only obligatory features of languages
that established &ldquo;mental patterns&rdquo; or &ldquo;habitual
thought&rdquo; (Whorf 1956: 139), since if it were optional then the
speaker could optionally do it one way or do it the other way. And so
this would not be a case of &ldquo;constraining the conceptual
structure&rdquo;. So we will likewise restrict our attention to
obligatory features here.</p>

<p>
Examples of relevant obligatory features would include lexical
distinctions like the light vs. dark blue forced choice in Greek, or
the forced choice between &ldquo;in (fitting tightly)&rdquo; vs.
&ldquo;in (fitting loosely)&rdquo; in Korean. They also include
grammatical distinctions like the forced choice in Spanish 2nd-person
pronouns between informal/intimate and formal/distant (informal
<i>t&uacute;</i> vs. formal <i>usted</i> in the singular; informal
<i>vosotros</i> vs. formal <i>ustedes</i> in the plural), or the
forced choice in Tamil 1st-person plural pronouns between inclusive
(&ldquo;we = me and you and perhaps others&rdquo;) and exclusive
(&ldquo;we = me and others not including you&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
The non-linguistic part of a Whorfian hypothesis will contrast the
psychological effects that habitually using the two languages has on
their speakers. For example, one might conjecture that the habitual
use of Spanish induces its speakers to be sensitive to the formal and
informal character of the speaker&rsquo;s relationship with their
interlocutor while habitually using English does not.</p>

<p>
So testing Whorfian hypotheses requires testing two independent
hypotheses with the appropriate kinds of data. In consequence,
evaluating them requires the expertise of both linguistics and
psychology, and is a multidisciplinary enterprise. Clearly, the
linguistic hypothesis may hold up where the psychological hypothesis
does not, or conversely.</p>

<p>
In addition, if linguists discovered that some linguistic feature was
optional in two different languages, then even if psychological
experiments showed differences between the two populations of
speakers, this would not show linguistic determination or influence.
The cognitive differences might depend on (say) cultural
differences.</p>

<p>
A further important consideration concerns the strength of the
inducement relationship that a Whorfian hypothesis posits between a
speaker&rsquo;s language and their non-linguistic capacities. The
claim that your language shapes or influences your cognition is quite
different from the claim that your language makes certain kinds of
cognition impossible (or obligatory) for you. The strength of any
Whorfian hypothesis will vary depending on the kind of relationship
being claimed, and the ease of revisability of that relation.</p>

<p>
A testable Whorfian hypothesis will have a schematic form something
like this:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Linguistic part</strong>: Feature <i>F</i> is obligatory
in <i>L</i><sub>1</sub> but optional in <i>L</i><sub>2</sub>.</li>

<li><strong>Psychological part</strong>: Speaking a language with
obligatory feature <i>F</i> bears relation <i>R</i> to the cognitive
effect <i>C</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The relation <i>R</i> might in principle be causation or
determination, but it is important to see that it might merely be
correlation, or slight favoring; and the non-linguistic cognitive
effect <i>C</i> might be readily suppressible or revisable.</p>

<p>
Dan Slobin (1996) presents a view that competes with Whorfian
hypotheses as standardly understood. He hypothesizes that <em>when the
speakers are using their cognitive abilities in the service of a
linguistic ability</em> (speaking, writing, translating, etc.), the
language they are planning to use to express their thought will have a
temporary online effect on how they express their thought. The claim
is that as long as language users are thinking in order to frame their
speech or writing or translation in some language, the mandatory
features of that language will influence the way they think.</p>

<p>
On Slobin&rsquo;s view, these effects quickly attenuate as soon as the
activity of thinking for speaking ends. For example, if a speaker is
thinking for writing in Spanish, then Slobin&rsquo;s hypothesis would
predict that given the obligatory formal/informal 2nd-person pronoun
distinction they would pay greater attention to the formal/informal
character of their social relationships with their audience than if
they were writing in English. But this effect is not permanent. As
soon as they stop thinking for speaking, the effect of Spanish on
their thought ends.</p>

<p>
Slobin&rsquo;s non-Whorfian linguistic relativist hypothesis raises
the importance of psychological research on bilinguals or people who
currently use two or more languages with a native or near-native
facility. This is because one clear way to test Slobin-like hypotheses
relative to Whorfian hypotheses would be to find out whether language
correlated non-linguistic cognitive differences between speakers hold
for bilinguals only when are thinking for speaking in one language,
but not when they are thinking for speaking in some other language. If
the relevant cognitive differences appeared and disappeared depending
on which language speakers were planning to express themselves in, it
would go some way to vindicate Slobin-like hypotheses over more
traditional Whorfian Hypotheses. Of course, one could alternately
accept a broadening of Whorfian hypotheses to include Slobin-like
evanescent effects. Either way, attention must be paid to the
persistence and revisability of the linguistic effects.</p>

<p>
Kousta et al. (2008) shows that &ldquo;for bilinguals there is
intraspeaker relativity in semantic representations and, therefore,
[grammatical] gender does not have a conceptual, non-linguistic
effect&rdquo; (843). Grammatical gender is obligatory in the languages
in which it occurs and has been claimed by Whorfians to have
persistent and enduring non-linguistic effects on representations of
objects (Boroditsky et al. 2003). However, Kousta et al. supports the
claim that bilinguals&rsquo; semantic representations vary depending
on which language they are using, and thus have transient effects.
This suggests that although some semantic representations of objects
may vary from language to language, their non-linguistic cognitive
effects are transitory.</p>

<p>
Some advocates of Whorfianism have held that if Whorfian hypotheses
were true, then meaning would be globally and radically indeterminate.
Thus, the truth of Whorfian hypotheses is equated with global
linguistic relativism&mdash;a well known self-undermining form of
relativism. But as we have seen, not all Whorfian hypotheses are
global hypotheses: they are about what is induced by particular
linguistic features. And the associated non-linguistic perceptual and
cognitive differences can be quite small, perhaps insignificant. For
example, Thierry et al. (2009) provides evidence that an obligatory
lexical distinction between light and dark blue affects Greek
speakers&rsquo; color perception in the left hemisphere only. And the
question of the degree to which this affects sensuous experience is
not addressed.</p>

<p>
The fact that Whorfian hypotheses need not be global linguistic
relativist hypotheses means that they do not conflict with the claim
that there are language universals. Structuralists of the first half
of the 20th century tended to disfavor the idea of universals: Martin
Joos&rsquo;s characterization of structuralist linguistics as claiming
that &ldquo;languages can differ without limit as to either extent or
direction&rdquo; (Joos 1966, 228) has been much quoted in this
connection. If the claim that languages can vary without limit were
conjoined with the claim that languages have significant and permanent
effects on the concepts and worldview of their speakers, a truly
profound global linguistic relativism would result. But neither
conjunct should be accepted. Joos&rsquo;s remark is regarded by nearly
all linguists today as overstated (and merely a caricature of the
structuralists), and Whorfian hypotheses do not have to take a global
or deterministic form.</p>

<p>
John Lucy, a conscientious and conservative researcher of Whorfian
hypotheses, has remarked:</p>

<blockquote>
We still know little about the connections between particular language
patterns and mental life&mdash;let alone how they operate or how
significant they are&hellip;a mere handful of empirical studies
address the linguistic relativity proposal directly and nearly all are
conceptually flawed. (Lucy 1996, 37)
</blockquote>

<p>
Although further empirical studies on Whorfian hypotheses have been
completed since Lucy published his 1996 review article, it is hard to
find any that have satisfied the criteria of:</p>

<ul>

<li>adequately utilizing both the relevant linguistic and
psychological research,</li>

<li>focusing on obligatory rather than optional linguistic
features,</li>

<li>stating hypotheses in a clear testable way, and</li>

<li>ruling out relevant competing Slobin-like hypotheses.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is much important work yet to be done on testing the range of
Whorfian hypotheses and other forms of linguistic conceptual
relativism, and on understanding the significance of any Whorfian
hypotheses that turn out to be well supported.</p>

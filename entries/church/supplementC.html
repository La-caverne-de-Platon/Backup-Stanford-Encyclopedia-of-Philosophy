<h3 id="C1SlinArgu">C.1 The Slingshot Argument</h3>

<p>
A natural reaction to this argument is to think that while it works
for an extensional language, it cannot be extended to a language
containing modal constructions or other intensional elements. For
example, although &ldquo;Scott is Scott&rdquo; is a necessary truth
(or close enough), &ldquo;Scott is the author of Waverley&rdquo; is
not, and this might seem to translate into a counterexample to
 <a href="index-2.html#assA">(A)</a>&mdash;the
 principle that co-denoting names or definite descriptions are
interchangeable&mdash;assuming the conclusion of Church&rsquo;s
argument that sentences denote their truth values. But (A) is neutral
as to how such terms as &ldquo;Scott&rdquo; behave in modal or other
intensional constructions and so at the very least more needs to be
said if this criticism is to stick.</p>

<p>
In fact, in his 1943 review of Carnap&rsquo;s (1942), Church gives a
version of the Slingshot (the first, in fact) that is independent of
the distinction between extension and intension and applies to
sentences of any complexity:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
However, if a language, in addition to certain other common
properties, contains an abstraction operator &ldquo;\((\lambda
x)\)&rdquo; such that &ldquo;\((\lambda x)(\ldots)\)&rdquo; means
&ldquo;the class of all \(x\) such that &hellip;&rdquo;,
then&mdash;independently of the question whether the language is
intensional or extensional&mdash;it is possible to prove that the
designata of sentences of the language must be truth values rather
than propositions. (1943a [BE: 260])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The following is a somewhat pared down version of Church&rsquo;s
argument (cf. the entry on
 <a href="../truth-values/index.html">truth values</a>):</p>
 
\[ \tag{1} S \] 

\[ \tag{2} \{x: x = x \amp \{ \textrm{not-}S\} = \Lambda \] 

\[ \tag{3} \Lambda = \Lambda \]

<p>
Here \(S\) is any true sentence. \(\Lambda\) is the empty set. Line
(1) records that \(S\) is true. Line (2) is obviously true since
&ldquo;not-S&rdquo; is false, and so \(\{x: x = x \amp
\textrm{not-}S\}\) has no elements. (1) and (2) are logically
equivalent, so assuming that logically equivalent sentences have the
same denotation, (1) and (2) denote the same thing. (3) may be derived
from (2) by
 <a href="index-2.html#assA">(A)</a>.
 Thus (1) and (3) must have the same denotation; but as Church
exclaims, they are as different as can be: &ldquo;one sentence is
L-true and the other not!&rdquo; ((3) is &ldquo;L-true&rdquo; (a
logical truth), while \(S\) may be assumed not to be.)</p>

<p>
This argument relies not only on
 <a href="index-2.html#assA">(A)</a>
 but also on</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="assC">(C)</dt>
<dd>Logically equivalent sentences have the same denotation.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Other versions, such as G&ouml;del&rsquo;s, make the same assumption.
(Note that (C) is stronger than
 <a href="index-2.html#assB">(B)</a>
 in the main text, since logical equivalence is weaker than synonymy.)
For more on the Slingshot and its connection to other issues discussed
in this entry&mdash;such as compositionality and synonymy&mdash;see
the postscript to (Salm&oacute;n 2010).</p>

<h3 id="C2TranArguCTAMatePuzz">C.2 The Translation Argument (CTA) and Mates&rsquo; Puzzle</h3>

<p>
Church also employed the CTA for another purpose (1954)&mdash;to
resolve a puzzle posed by Mates (1950). Consider the following pair of
sentences:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exb1">(1)</dt>
<dd>Jones believes that lawyers are wealthy</dd>
<dt id="exb2">(2)</dt>
<dd>Jones believes that attorneys are wealthy.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Some philosophers have supposed that (1) and (2) can diverge in truth
value, contradicting the principle that synonyms (&ldquo;lawyer&rdquo;
and &ldquo;attorney&rdquo;) are intersubstitutable <em>salva
veritate</em> (without change in truth value). For example, Jones
might think that &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; means <em>law student</em> and
that lawyers are wealthy, so that (1) will be true, and (2) false.
(But we will shortly raise a question about this explanation.)</p>

<p>
Now, Mates cleverly observed that whether or not such a view is
correct, (that (1) and (2) can have different truth values), the mere
existence of philosophers who <em>think</em> it is correct renders the
following false:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exb3">(3)</dt>
<dd>No one doubts that whoever believes that lawyers are wealthy
believes that attorneys are wealthy.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Yet even such philosophers will acknowledge the truth of the
following:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exb4">(4)</dt>
<dd>No one doubts that whoever believes that lawyers are wealthy
believes that lawyers are wealthy.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It therefore seems that there is an outright counterexample to the
principle <em>that synonyms can be freely substituted for one another
without inducing a change of truth value</em>, provided only that
there happen to be philosophers who think the principle is false! For
the sake of further discussion, let us call the italicized principle
&ldquo;the synonyms principle&rdquo;
(&ldquo;<strong>syn</strong>&rdquo; for short). If
<strong>syn</strong> is deemed false by anyone, then (3) and (4)
constitute a counterexample to it and <strong>syn</strong> must be
abandoned and perhaps replaced by some subtler principle. (Putnam
[1954] pursues this latter course.)</p>

<p>
But if <strong>syn</strong> is true, the conclusion is inevitable that
anyone who entertains the slightest doubt that lawyers are attorneys
actually doubts that lawyers are lawyers. Similarly, anyone who
believes that lawyers are lawyers is committed to the belief that
lawyers are attorneys&mdash;even if they believe that
&ldquo;attorney&rdquo; means <em>law student</em>. Church defends
<strong>syn</strong> and was prepared to accept such results as these.
He argues that those who are not so prepared are confused.</p>

<p>
Church&rsquo;s argument in his (1954) turns on the fact that German
has no word for a fortnight as opposed to a period of fourteen days.
But the argument is applicable to the lawyer/attorney case too, and we
will stick with this example. We have only to imagine a possible
language that has no pair of synonyms corresponding to
&ldquo;lawyer&rdquo; and &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; but only a single
word, &ldquo;shmoyer&rdquo;, say, for either. It is then obvious that
the translations into this language, Shmenglish, of (3) and (4) are
identical. If now &ldquo;it is true that&rdquo; is prefixed to (4) and
&ldquo;it is false that&rdquo; to (3) and the results are translated
into Shmenglish, we have an outright contradiction. Church concludes
that one can no more doubt that lawyers are attorneys than one can
doubt that lawyers are lawyers.</p>

<p>
Church recognizes, however, that someone who thinks it is possible to
doubt that attorneys are lawyers and yet not possible to doubt that
lawyers are lawyers need not fail to understand that
&ldquo;lawyer&rdquo; and &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; are synonyms. They
might simply question the truth of <strong>syn</strong>. But Church
argues that such skepticism about <strong>syn</strong> is misdirected.
The culprit is not <strong>syn</strong> but rather a related
semantical principle concerning the satisfaction of open sentences
<em>mentioning</em> particular linguistic items. Compare:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exb5">(5)</dt>
<dd>Whoever is an attorney is a lawyer</dd>
<dt id="exb6">(6)</dt>
<dd>Whoever satisfies &ldquo;\(x\) is an attorney&rdquo; satisfies
&ldquo;\(x\) is a lawyer&rdquo;.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
We are accustomed to thinking of these two conditions as virtually
identical, but the subtle difference is that in (5)
&ldquo;attorney&rdquo; and &ldquo;lawyer&rdquo; are <em>used</em>
whereas in (6) they are <em>mentioned</em>, so the two linguistic
items are part of the subject matter of (6) but not of (5); and hence
the two sentences are arguably not synonymous. In fact, invoking the
CTA, Church would argue that the sentences are not synonymous
precisely on the grounds that their German translations are not
synonymous&mdash;since, once again, they would convey different
information to a German speaker who does not speak English. Church
would now argue that someone who appears to doubt that (5) should
instead be understood to doubt that (6), which Church would maintain
is possible without doubting that whoever satisfies &ldquo;\(x\) is a
lawyer&rdquo; satisfies &ldquo;\(x\) is a lawyer&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
There are thus two key steps to Church&rsquo;s reply to Mates. The
first is the argument that while (3) and (4) may not <em>seem</em>
synonymous, in fact they are, since their translations into Shmenglish
are synonymous and in fact it is not possible to assign them different
truth values. The second step is the argument that the seeming
possibility of doubting that attorneys are lawyers can be traced to
the real possibility of doubting (6) instead.</p>

<p>
Yet it may be felt that each of these steps involves some sleight of
hand. How could anyone who understands the meanings of
&ldquo;lawyer&rdquo; and &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; entertain any doubt
about (6)? And why should translation into a less expressive language
demonstrate anything about English&mdash;to wit that (3) and (4) are
synonymous? These are fair questions, but they reflect a
misunderstanding of Church&rsquo;s basic point of view (adumbrated
further in
 <a href="supplementE.html">supplement E</a>).
 First, as Church observes, it is no defect of German that it lacks a
special abbreviation such as &ldquo;fortnight&rdquo; for a period of
fourteen days. From the perspective of formal semantics such
abbreviations are in principle eliminable and the language without the
abbreviation is no less expressive than the language with it. In the
language of arithmetic, for example, we abbreviate &ldquo;less than or
equal to&rdquo; by &ldquo;\(\le\)&rdquo;, but this does not increase
the expressive power of the language. Similarly, Church would view
&ldquo;lawyer&rdquo;, &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; and &ldquo;shmoyer&rdquo;
as three eliminable (in principle) abbreviations for the same longer
phrase:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a person who is qualified to advise clients on their rights and
obligations according to the law as well as to represent them in court
and to conduct lawsuits.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Shmenglish is not any less expressive than English in the logical
sense. In response, some philosophers will say that even if
&ldquo;lawyer&rdquo; and &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; were introduced to
abbreviate the same longer phrase, there remains the question of why
they should remain synonymous in all contexts and so remain
eliminable. To this day, however, Church&rsquo;s view that
&ldquo;lawyer&rdquo; and &ldquo;attorney&rdquo; are eliminable
abbreviations for the same longer phrase seems to describe the
<em>correct</em> use of those words; as such, its intuitive appeal is
as least as great as that of Mates&rsquo; view that (3) and (4) can
differ in truth value. But there remains the issue of whether such
intuitions track semantic properties in a way that makes them immune
to reasonable challenge.</p>

<p>
Secondly, it is a curious feature of Church&rsquo;s discussion that he
does not directly address the question of just how someone who
understands English could actually doubt that (6) (or Church&rsquo;s
corresponding sentence (18) of (1954)). This must be left an open
question. What is clear from Church&rsquo;s discussion is that the
information conveyed by (5) differs from the information conveyed by
(6), and so insofar as it is possible to doubt that (6), it is
consistent to maintain, as Church would, that while it is not possible
to consistently doubt that (5) (which would amount to the doubt that
lawyers are lawyers), it is possible to doubt that (6).</p>

<p>
Some have thought that Church&rsquo;s resolution of the paradox of
analysis and his resolution of Mates&rsquo; problem are incompatible.
Anderson remarks of the former that it is &ldquo;Ingenious,
compelling, and undeniably correct&rdquo; (1998: 145). And yet:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Church has implicitly assumed, in his argument against Mates, that the
indirect senses of [&ldquo;brother&rdquo;] and [&ldquo;male
sibling&rdquo;] are identical because these two expressions are
synonymous. (1998: 145)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Anderson&rsquo;s examples are &ldquo;fortnight&rdquo; and
&ldquo;period of fourteen days&rdquo;.) Church suggests that the
concepts denoted by &ldquo;brother&rdquo; and &ldquo;male
sibling&rdquo; are the <em>customary senses</em> that
&ldquo;brother&rdquo; and &ldquo;male sibling&rdquo; express in
customary contexts in which they are viewed as denoting classes; in
the context of the sentence &ldquo;\(b = ms\)&rdquo; however, the two
terms <em>denote</em> these customary senses and acquire and
<em>different</em> indirect senses. (Church does not mention
Frege&rsquo;s notion of indirect sense (<em>ungerade Sinn</em>) in his
review, but he no doubt would have understood the problem if it had
been put to him.)</p>

<p>
However, Anderson claims that Church&rsquo;s reply to Mates requires
Church to assume that the indirect senses of a pair of synonyms must
be identical. For otherwise, apparently, in our terms there would be
no guarantee that the propositions expressed by (3) and (4) are
identical, as Church requires. As Anderson says, &ldquo;Something has
to give&rdquo; (1998). He suggests that Church&rsquo;s attempted
resolution of the Mates Problem must be abandoned in favor of one that
again invokes Frege&rsquo;s distinction between sense and denotation.
See Bealer (1982) and Salm&oacute;n (1993) for different assessments
of the problem.</p>

<h3 id="C3BurgReplChurMatePuzz">C.3 Burge&rsquo;s Reply to Church on Mates&rsquo; Puzzle</h3>

<p>
Church formulates Mates&rsquo; problem in terms of the pair of
synonyms &ldquo;fortnight&rdquo; and &ldquo;period of fourteen
days&rdquo; using analogues of (3), (4), (5), and (6) of the previous
subsection. Corresponding to (3) and (5), Church employs the following
sentences, where for readability &ldquo;SCM&rdquo; abbreviates the
phrase &ldquo;the seventh consulate of Marius&rdquo;:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exc1">(1)</dt>
<dd>Nobody doubts that whoever believes that SCM lasted less than a
period of fourteen days believes that SCM lasted less than a
fortnight</dd>
<dt id="exc2">(2)</dt>
<dd>Nobody doubts that whoever believes that SCM lasted less than a
period of fourteen days believes that SCM lasted less than a period of
fourteen days.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Church now observes that the German equivalents of (1) and (2) turn
out to be the very same sentence of German, since there is no single
word corresponding to &ldquo;fortnight&rdquo; in German. It then
follows that the German equivalents of (1) and (2) cannot differ in
truth value, unless we are to count the German language as
inconsistent for merely lacking a special term for
&ldquo;fortnight&rdquo;. Church also remarks that it cannot be a
defect of German that it lacks such term. The lack of a single-word
translation of &ldquo;fortnight&rdquo; cannot be regarded as a
deficiency of German</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
else we should be obliged to call it a deficiency of German also that
there is no word to mean a period of fifty-four days and six hours.
(1954 [BE: 354-5])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Church takes this argument to show that the perception that (1) and
(2) might differ in truth value (and therefore in meaning) is an
illusion.</p>

<p>
Church suggests that those who think that (1) and (2) differ in truth
value are confusing them with certain other sentences that
<em>mention</em> specific words and phrases of English and that,
therefore, via CTA, can be seen <em>not</em> to be synonymous.</p>

<p>
Let &ldquo;<em>Px</em>&rdquo; abbreviate the one-place predicate of
English &ldquo;\(x\) believes that the SCM lasted a fortnight&rdquo;
and let &ldquo;<em>Qx</em>&rdquo; abbreviate the one-place predicate
of English &ldquo;\(x\) believes that the SCM lasted a period of
fourteen days&rdquo;; and consider the following metalinguistic
counterparts of (1) and (2):</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exc3">(3)</dt>
<dd>Nobody doubts that if \(x\) satisfies \(Q\), then \(x\) satisfies
\(P\)</dd>
<dt id="exc4">(4)</dt>
<dd>Nobody doubts that if \(x\) satisfies \(Q\), then \(x\) satisfies
\(Q\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Church contends that those who think that (1) and (2) differ in truth
value and thus in meaning are confusing them with (3) and (4),
respectively. A German speaker who knows no English but who knows a
little logic might well assent to the German translation of (4), call
it, and dissent from the German translation of (3) precisely on the
grounds that they themselves have the relevant doubt in the one case,
and lack it in the other. Church concludes with the following
memorable summary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Granted this, let us translate into German &ldquo;Mates doubts that
(15) but does not doubt that (14)&rdquo;. As the resulting German
sentence is a direct self-contradiction, and as it cannot matter to
the soundness of our reasoning whether we carry it out in English or
in German, we must conclude that Mates (whatever he himself may tell
us) does not really so doubt-and that he must have mistaken the doubt
that (18) for the doubt that (15). (1954 [BE: 355])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The quoted sentence is:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exc5">(5)</dt>
<dd>Mates doubts that whoever believes that the SCM lasted a period of
fourteen days believes that the SCM lasted a fortnight but does not
doubt that whoever believes that the SCM lasted a period of fourteen
days believes that the SCM lasted a period of fourteen days.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Its metalinguistic counterpart is:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exc6">(6)</dt>
<dd>Mates doubts that if \(x\) satisfies \(Q\), then \(x\) satisfies
\(P\) but does not doubt that if \(x\) satisfies \(Q\), then \(x\)
satisfies \(Q\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Church&rsquo;s concluding argument is that since the German
translation of (5) is a direct contradiction, it cannot be true, and
(6) must be true instead. As noted above, however, Church never
addresses the question of how (6) could be true.</p>

<p>
The CTA has come in for some harsh criticism&mdash;even from prominent
philosophers, some of whom dismiss the argument out of hand (see
Salm&oacute;n 2001: fn. 4 for references). Most of this criticism can
be safely ignored. But there is one argument due to Tyler Burge that
is worth rehearsing, since it serves to reveal the (perhaps somewhat
hidden) force of the CTA.</p>

<p>
Burge remarks that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Interpreting Bates&rsquo;s doubt as metalinguistic will enable one to
avoid attributing to Bates the original object-language doubt, only if
one denies that Bates believes the most obvious truisms connecting
metalinguistic semantical sentences with the object-language
sentences. (1978: 123; &ldquo;Bates&rdquo; is a fictional stand-in for
Mates)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One such alleged truism is that in fact</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exc7">(7)</dt>
<dd>All lawyers are attorneys</dd>
<dt id="exc8">(8)</dt>
<dd>Whoever satisfies &ldquo;\(x\) is a lawyer&rdquo; satisfies
&ldquo;\(x\) is an attorney&rdquo;</dd>
</dl>

<p>
are logically equivalent since in general</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exc9">(9)</dt>
<dd>For any \(y\), \(y\) satisfies \(A(x)\) if and only if
\(A(y)\),</dd>
</dl>

<p>
is a logical truth about the satisfaction relation. This appears to
entail both of the following:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exc10">(10)</dt>
<dd>For any \(y\), \(y\) satisfies &ldquo;\(x\) is a lawyer&rdquo; if
and only if \(y\) is a lawyer</dd>
<dt id="exc11">(11)</dt>
<dd>For any \(y\), \(y\) satisfies &ldquo;\(x\) is an attorney&rdquo;
if and only if \(y\) is an attorney;</dd>
</dl>

<p>
And these equivalences can be used to show that (7) and (8) are
logically equivalent. Mates&rsquo; puzzle is thereby restored. Any
doubt about (8), which Church concedes is possible, reduces to a doubt
about (7), which Church claims amounts to the doubt that lawyers are
lawyers.</p>

<p>
Notice, however, that the left-to-right implication of (11) is
justified only on the assumption that &ldquo;\(x\) is an
attorney&rdquo; means in the language in which (11) is
written&mdash;English plus variables&mdash;that \(x\) is an attorney.
Without this assumption, there is no basis for the implication. This
is exactly the situation we encountered in
 <a href="index-2.html#TranArgu">section 3.3 of the main text</a>
 with the inference from the sentences (3) to (2) of that section. A
person who lacks this piece of information is not in a position to
deduce (7) from (8), and this stops Burge&rsquo;s argument in its
tracks. The formal sentence (9) obscures the problem since it obscures
the fact that the formula &ldquo;\(A(x)\)&rdquo; is mentioned, whilst
the formula &ldquo;\(A(y)\)&rdquo; is used. (Here &ldquo;\(y\)&rdquo;
functions as a mere place-holder and &ldquo;\(A(y)\)&rdquo; is short
for something like &ldquo;it is the case that \(y\) has the property
or belongs to the class \(A\)&rdquo;) Furthermore, it is built into
the symbolism used in (9) that &ldquo;\(A(x)\)&rdquo; means that
\(A(x)\) in the formal language in which (9) is written. But its
applications to natural language are another story.</p>

<p>
Burge&rsquo;s objection is therefore not successful and it joins a
myriad of failed objections to and false assessments of the CTA (cf.
Salm&oacute;n 2001). The fundamental point is that expressions of the
form &ldquo;believes that so and so&rdquo; or &ldquo;means that so and
so&rdquo; resist sententialist interpretation. This in turn supports
the idea, endorsed by both Frege and Church, that
&ldquo;that&rdquo;-complements are names of propositions or properties
as objective, language independent, abstract entities. Church was very
firm in his belief in the existence of such things (see
 <a href="index-2.html#RealAbouProp">&sect;6.3</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="C4ChurQuinParaAbouModa">C.4 Church on Quine&rsquo;s Paradox About Modality</h3>

<p>
Church discusses Quine&rsquo;s well-known critique of modal logic in
an early review (Church 1943b Postscript 1968) of Quine&rsquo;s
(1943), as well as in a much later paper (1982). Despite all the ink
spilt on this subject, Church&rsquo;s relatively brief remarks are
well worth reviewing. Church begins his review with the claim that
Quine&rsquo;s distinction between purely designative occurrences of
names and others&mdash;occurrences open or not open to substitution of
co-designative names&mdash;is &ldquo;fully anticipated&rdquo; by Frege
(1892a):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
who distinguishes in the same way between the ordinary
(<em>gew&ouml;hnliche</em>) and the oblique (<em>ungerade</em>) use of
a name. In fact the relationship between Quine&rsquo;s present paper
and Frege&rsquo;s of 1892 is close throughout, even to the use of
similar, and in one instance identical, illustrations. Quine&rsquo;s
failure to refer to Frege&rsquo;s paper indicates that he is
unacquainted with it, but it is probable that he is indirectly
indebted to Frege through Russell&rsquo;s 1119
[<em>sic</em>].&nbsp;(1943b [BE: 943])</p>
</blockquote> <!--- notes in supp so far -->

<p>
Church decided, as of the 1968 postscript to (1943b),
to call the problem of
substitutivity of co-designative names &ldquo;Quine&rsquo;s
Paradox&rdquo;. The following three sentences illustrate the
paradox:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="exd1">(1)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, \(9 = 9\)</dd>
<dt id="exd2">(2)</dt>
<dd>\(9 =\) the number of planets</dd>
<dt id="exd3">(3)</dt>
<dd>Necessarily, the number of planets \(= 9\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The substitution of &ldquo;the number of planets&rdquo; for the first
occurrence of &ldquo;9&rdquo; in (1), which is true, results in (3),
which is false. Quine&rsquo;s diagnosis was that the modal operator in
(1) &ldquo;seals off&rdquo; the sentence following it from
substitution in much the same way that &ldquo;so-called&rdquo; in
&ldquo;Giorgione was so-called because of his size&rdquo; &ldquo;seals
off&rdquo; the substitution of &ldquo;Barbarelli&rdquo; for
&ldquo;Giorgione&rdquo; (the occurrence of &ldquo;Giorgione&rdquo; is
not purely designative). Needless to say, modal logic has not
developed on the basis of this idea, but Quine&rsquo;s purpose was
only to draw attention to the problem. Extrapolating from Frege
(1892a)&mdash;who does not discuss modal logic&mdash;the occurrences
of &ldquo;9&rdquo; in (1) do not denote the number but rather the
ordinary sense of &ldquo;9&rdquo;&mdash;the sense it has in &ldquo;\(9
= 9\)&rdquo; standing alone, and the occurrence of this sentence in
(1) denotes the proposition that \(9 = 9\).</p>

<p>
Church was very keen to see this Fregean idea developed in detail.
Instead of treating &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo;, &ldquo;possibly&rdquo;,
&ldquo;believes that&rdquo;, &ldquo;asserts that&rdquo; and the like
as attaching to sentences to form new sentences (i.e., as sentential
operators syntactically on a par with sentential connectives) they
should rather be seen as predicates attaching to names of propositions
&ldquo;and the result of prefixing a modal operator to a sentence is
simply not well-formed&rdquo;. But Church also considers alternative
resolutions of the paradox more closely related to the language of
<em>Principia Mathematica.</em> He mentions, for example, a proposal
of Quine&rsquo;s to treat names as denoting not objects but rather
individual concepts. Accordingly, (2) is false and the faulty
inference is blocked. Such a proposal, among several others, has been
developed independently of the system of <em>Principia.</em></p>

<p>
In both the postscript (1968) and (1982), Church discusses
another&mdash;now famous&mdash;problem that Quine raises for modal
logic. This concerns not names but variables of quantification. Church
notes first that Quine&rsquo;s paradox is essentially the same as the
puzzle about King George IV and Sir Walter Scott of Russell&rsquo;s
(1905) and so</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is not surprising that Smullyan is able to resolve Quine&rsquo;s
paradox by means of Russell&rsquo;s theory of descriptions. (1982 [BE:
810])&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
See Smullyan 1947 and 1948. But now a further problem arises.
Elaborating on remarks by Quine, Church notes that the following
theorems are &ldquo;hardly avoidable&rdquo; if modal logic is
formulated using sentential operators:</p> 

\[\tag{4} 
\nsim F(x) \supset_x \hdot F(y) \supset_y x\ne y \] 

\[\tag{5} 
(x) \sim \Diamond x\ne x \] 

\[\tag{6} 
\Diamond[x \ne y] \supset_{xy} x\ne y.\]

<p>
(Note that Church adopts the following notational conventions from
Russell&rsquo;s (PM). First, a connective can take a variable as
subscript: that variable becomes a universal quantifier whose scope is
precisely that of the connective. Second, a dot placed before a
connective or (as above) a quantifier brackets a proposition.) (6)
follows from (4) and (5), which may be taken as axioms definitive of
equality. Church says of (6) that it is a version of Murphy&rsquo;s
Law: What can go wrong will go wrong! He also formulates a parallel
argument using belief in place of possibility:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(7)</dt>
<dd>For every \(x\) and every \(y\), if George IV does not believe
that \(x\ne x\), if George IV believes that \(x\ne y\), then \(x\ne
y\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This is merely another substitution instance of (4), and hence
assuming that</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(8)</dt>
<dd>For every \(x\), George IV does not believe that \(x\ne x.\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It follows that</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(9)</dt>
<dd>For every \(x\) and every \(y\), if George IV believes that \(x\ne
y\), then \(x\ne y\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
And it does seem to follow from (9) that if George IV believed, as he
might have believed at some point, that Scott was not the author of
Waverley, then Scott didn&rsquo;t write Waverley!</p>

<p>
Church&rsquo;s aim is to show that if intensional logic is formulated
using sentential operators rather than names of propositions, such
anomalies result. But in the case of modal logic, at least, his
argument has not been influential. (6) and the necessity of identity
are now accepted as theorems of quantified modal logic with identity.
We believe that (9) and the like deserve further attention. The issue
is closely related to a remark of Church&rsquo;s summarizing
Quine&rsquo;s query of quantified modal logic. Assume that George IV
believed that the author of Ivanhoe and the author of Waverley are one
and the same, but that he did not believe that Scott wrote Waverley.
Then let us ask for what objects (or individuals) \(y\) we have
that</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(10)</dt>
<dd>George IV believes that \(y\) wrote Waverley.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The ordinary notion of belief seems to require that although (10)
holds when \(y\) is specified in a special way, namely as having
written <em>Ivanhoe</em>, it may yet fail when the same \(y\) is
specified in some other way, for example as
&ldquo;scottizer&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Church&rsquo;s judgment is that this form of Quine&rsquo;s paradox is
more telling than the previous one concerning modality&mdash;it is the
problem of the &ldquo;transparency of belief&rdquo;&mdash;and he terms
the problem &ldquo;Russellian&rdquo; on the grounds that
Russell&rsquo;s theory of descriptions leads directly to it.
Nevertheless,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The sort of essentialism to which the transparency of notions such as
belief and necessity leads does not rise above the level of variables
and primitive constants. (1982 [BE: 813])&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For example, the universal quantifiers implicit in (6) cannot be
instantiated to definite descriptions. Although it is possible that
Scott did not write <em>Waverley</em>&mdash;and so was not identical
to that author, supposing there was one&mdash;, it does not follow
that Scott in fact did not write <em>Waverley</em>. By now, this
matter has received a good deal of attention (see Fitting &amp;
Mendelsohn, 1998). (It&rsquo;s worth mentioning parenthetically that
the general form of argument leading from (4) to (6) or from (7) to
(9) has frequently been used to argue for other theses&mdash;for
example, that there is no such thing as vague identity.)</p>

<p>
To avoid these problems with modal logic, Church suggests two ways
out: One is to eliminate names altogether by replacing them with
predicates&mdash;&ldquo;Scott&rdquo;, becomes
&ldquo;Scottizes&rdquo;&mdash;a method traceable to Russell. But this
still leaves the predicates which themselves are names of attributes,
and the attempt to eliminate these leads to a regress. In any case,
this approach would severely restrict the category of names and would
require that the variables range over intensional entities&mdash;with
the possible exception of the individual variables. The alternative is
the Fregean method which</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
maximizes the category of names and allows names of, and variables
for, a wide variety of entities, both intensional and extensional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Church&rsquo;s attempt to implement the latter approach resulted in
his logic of sense and denotation, but he also worked out a way of
implementing the Russellian approach (see
 <a href="supplementE.html">supplement E</a>;
 another Russellian solution is proposed by Salm&oacute;n [1986]).
It&rsquo;s important to note, however, that if type restrictions are
ignored, the idea of treating modality as a predicate of propositions
can lead to contradiction, assuming principles valid in standard modal
logics&mdash;that what is necessarily true, is true, for example (see
Montague 1962; Anderson 1983).</p>

<h3><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
David Hume&rsquo;s (1711&ndash;1776) wide-ranging philosophical works
discuss the emotions at length, most notably in his <em>Treatise of
Human Nature</em> (1739&ndash;40), which devotes the second of its three
books to the passions, as well as in the <em>Dissertation on the
Passions</em> (from <em>Four Dissertations</em> 1757), which covers
much the same material. Because of Hume&rsquo;s sentimentalist bent,
his works on moral philosophy are also important for his understanding
of the emotions: these include Book III of the <em>Treatise</em>, on
the moral sentiments, and the <em>Enquiry Concerning the Principles of
Morals</em> (1751). Hume&rsquo;s essays, published in various editions
during his lifetime, also cover diverse topics related to the
emotions, such as &ldquo;Of the Delicacy of Taste and Passion,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Of Love and Marriage,&rdquo; &ldquo;Of Superstition and
Enthusiasm&rdquo; (1741), and &ldquo;Of the Standard of Taste&rdquo;
(1757). Other texts, such as his autobiographical sketches, and the
six volumes of his <em>History of England</em> (1754&ndash;62), offer
material illustrating Hume&rsquo;s views on the topic. The
<em>Treatise</em>, however, contains ample material to serve as a
starting point.</p>

<h3><a name="Ter">2. Terminology</a></h3>

<p>
Hume groups the emotions in general among the perceptions of the mind,
although they also serve as motivations for acting and even for
reasoning. In doing so, he uses an array of terms to describe our
affective perceptions, especially the &lsquo;passion,&rsquo;
&lsquo;sentiment&rsquo; and &lsquo;taste&rsquo; familiar from
Shaftesbury and Hutcheson. Although he sometimes uses
&rsquo;emotion&rsquo; interchangeably with &rsquo;passion&rsquo; (see,
e.g., T I.3.5 85), he often seems to mean only a mental motion (see,
e.g., T I.2.3 36). But if Hume uses old terminology, he introduces
several new twists. For one, he borrows the distinction between calm
and violent from Hutcheson, but at least initially applies it to
distinguish among types of passions (T II.1.1 276).
&rsquo;Passions&rsquo; are impressions of reflection, yet as in
Hutcheson, they seem to be relatively low-order perceptions: they are
responses to pleasurable or painful perceptions &ndash; and sometimes even
innate impulses and instincts &ndash; not meta-perceptions. However, Hume
also talks about &rsquo;sentiments&rsquo; which seem relatively
refined affective responses. The essay &ldquo;Of the Delicacy of Taste
and Passion&rdquo; presents a clear contrast between that
&ldquo;higher and more refined taste,&rdquo; which is also identified
with sentiment, and the violent passions that disturb susceptible
souls (Hume 1985 6). Sentiment and taste are calm affective states,
susceptible to cultivation, subject to standards and capable of
reining in the excesses of overly &ldquo;delicate,&rdquo; i.e.,
violent, passions. This usage may explain why, when Hume moves to
moral philosophy in Book III of his <em>Treatise</em>, he uses
&rsquo;sentiment&rsquo; almost exclusively for the affective
impressions that enable us to make moral distinctions. However Hume
does not even acknowledge his change of terminology there, much less
explain it. So, whatever distinction he might have intended by the
different word choices remains elusive and subject to competing
interpretations (see, e.g., Loeb 1977, Fieser 1992, Schmitter 2013b,
Watkins 2019, chap. 4).</p>

<h3><a name="ConBooTre">3. Conclusion to Book I of the <em>Treatise</em></a></h3>

<p>
Hume does not merely discuss the emotions theoretically, he narrates
the philosophical experience of them in the &ldquo;Conclusion to this
Book&rdquo; that closes Book I of the <em>Treatise</em>. This section
treats the narrator&rsquo;s emotional landscape as a response to his
skeptical conclusions about reason, sense-perception, and the self.
The narrator feels himself &ldquo;a strange, uncouth monster,&rdquo;
shunned by society and marooned in a skeptical isolation in which even
his views about how to limit his beliefs are unstable (T I.4.7 264).
Hume treats this unhappy, skeptical view as a kind of illness, which
eventually receives a cure from &ldquo;nature herself.&rdquo; The
first sign of a return to health is &ldquo;a splenetic humour&rdquo;
that rejects philosophy (T I.4.7 269). But the conclusion resolves
with the narrator replacing his despairing skepticism with a cheerful
skepticism that is &ldquo;diffident of [its] philosophical doubts, as
well as of [its] philosophical conviction&rdquo; (T I.4.7 273). This
seems a fruitful approach, for the <em>Treatise</em> goes on for two
more Books, philosophizing in a &ldquo;careless,&rdquo; i.e.,
carefree, manner (see Baier 1991 1ff.).</p>

<p>
The exact source of the &ldquo;philosophical melancholy and
delirium&rdquo; in Book I, and just how nature comes to the rescue are
matters of much debate and a host of creative interpretations (see,
e.g., Baier 1991, Garrett 1997, Ainslie 2015, Goldhaber forthcoming).
What seems clear is that the cure wrought by nature is a matter of a
change of affective state &ndash; &ldquo;the returns of a serious good
humour&rsquo;d disposition&rdquo; (T I.4.7 270) &ndash; rather than
the cultivation of any new beliefs or reasoning techniques (although
the &ldquo;title principle&rdquo; Garret finds in the conclusion might
count as a belief that reason should be driven by &ldquo;natural
propensities,&rdquo; see 1997 232&ndash;7). This new mood inclines him again
to philosophy, and the <em>Treatise</em> proceeds to topics neglected
in the first book, particularly the nature of our passions and
sentiments and how they fit us for social life. The motivation
throughout is affective: pleasure, an &ldquo;ambition &hellip; of
contributing to the instruction of mankind&rdquo; (T I.4.7 271), and
above all, curiosity. Although this curiosity is not exactly the same
as Descartes&rsquo;s and Malebranche&rsquo;s &ldquo;wonder,&rdquo;
Hume does declare in the conclusion of Book II that the &ldquo;first
source of all our enquiries&rdquo; is &ldquo;curiosity, or that love
of truth&rdquo; (T II.3.10 448, see further Schafer 2014). It drives
both philosophy and hunting, of which &ldquo;there cannot be two
passions more nearly resembling each other&rdquo; (T II.3.10 451),
although the passion for gambling comes close. The passion for hunting
down truth becomes yet stronger when directed at the objects that
intrinsically interest us: human nature, particularly the shared
passions and sentiments that motivate us and our interactions with
other people &ndash; in short, the topics of Books II and III of the
<em>Treatise</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="ClaPasBooTre">4. The Classification of the Passions in Book II of the <em>Treatise</em></a></h3>

<p>
The perceptions of the mind divide into two kinds: impressions and
ideas (roughly, feeling and thinking): &ldquo;Those perceptions, which
enter with most force and violence, we may name <em>impressions</em>;
and under this name I comprehend all our sensations, passions and
emotions, as they make their first appearance in the soul. By
<em>ideas</em> I mean the faint images of these in thinking and
reasoning &hellip;&rdquo; (T I.1.1 1). Hume proposes a scale of
vivacity, in which impressions are vivid, ideas are faint, and beliefs
(e.g., in the existence of things we do not presently perceive) are
somewhere in the middle. But ideas can borrow vivacity from other
sources through the principles of association found in the
imagination.</p>

<p>
Impressions can also be divided into two kinds: impressions of sense
(original) and impressions of reflection (secondary). The impressions
of sense include all our sensations, as well as perceptions of
pleasure and pain; the impressions of reflection include all our
passions and sentiments. In Book I.1.2, Hume says that the impressions
of sense arise in the soul &ldquo;originally, from unknown
causes&rdquo; (T I.1.2 7), whereas secondary impressions
&ldquo;proceed from some of these original ones, either immediately or
by the interposition of its idea&rdquo; (T II.1.1 275). Still, Hume
considers even secondary impressions to be in some sense
&ldquo;original existences:&rdquo; they may follow on the heels of a
distinct impression (sensory or reflective) or idea, but are not
copies of them. On the other hand, impressions can be related
associatively through resemblance, and it is the associative
constructions they allow that provide structure to our often chaotic
thought processes (particularly through &ldquo;the double relation of
impressions and ideas&rdquo; discussed below).</p>

<p>
The passions, then, are impressions of reflection. The
<em>Treatise</em> separates this broad categorization into calm and
violent passions (although elsewhere Hume sometimes reserves
&rsquo;passion&rsquo; for the violent ones). But this &ldquo;vulgar
and specious division&rdquo; plays little role in the
<em>Treatise</em>, and Hume insists that calm passions are not
necessarily weak, nor violent ones strong. More important for
Hume&rsquo;s purposes is the distinction between direct and indirect
passions. Direct passions typically arise immediately from &ldquo;good
or evil, from plain or pleasure&rdquo; (although they also comprise
desire-like insincts and appetites); indirect passions require the
&ldquo;conjunction of other qualities,&rdquo; particularly the
interposition of an idea (T II.1.1 276). Curiosity, or love of truth
falls among the direct passions, which generally include desire and
aversion, grief and joy, hope and fear. Among the &ldquo;immediate
effects of pain and pleasure,&rdquo; Hume also counts the will, or
&ldquo;the internal impression we feel and are conscious of, when we
knowingly give rise to any new motion of our body, or new perception
of our mind&rdquo; (T II.3.1 399). The will is not itself a passion; it
is, however, closely connected to the direct passions, since they
constitute its &ldquo;influencing motives&rdquo; (see T II.3.3 413&ndash;4).
Among the direct passions that move the will, Hume includes both those
arising from pain or pleasure and those coming &ldquo;from a natural
impulse or instinct&rdquo; that &ldquo;properly speaking, produce good
or evil&rdquo; (T II.3.9 439; see also Radcliffe 2018, chap.1). In
contrast, Hume admits only that the indirect passions can influence
the will through their effects on the direct passions. Yet book II
begins with the indirect passions of pride and humility, love and
hate, which fill two of its three main divisions.</p>

<h3><a name="DouRelImpIdeCasPri">5. The Double Relation of Impressions and Ideas in the Case of Pride</a></h3>

<p>
Indirect passions differ from the direct not only in their connection
to the will, but also because of their complicated intentionality.
Indirect passions have objects that are distinct from their causes,
although their respective ideas are associated. The causes can be
further subdivided into the quality that excites the passion and the
subject in which the quality inheres. In the case of pride, the object
is self. The cause is the pleasing quality in a subject that is
(somehow) related to self. This forms the framework on which Hume
builds the &ldquo;double relation of ideas and impressions&rdquo; (T
II.1.5 286), in which impressions of sense are related to resembling
passions, and ideas of the cause are related through various
principles of association to the object of the passion. Although Hume
identifies the second impression as the passion proper, understanding
its nature and effects requires the whole structure, as we may see in
the case of pride. The cause of pride has a quality that gives a
pleasurable perception, which is found in a subject, the idea of which
is related to the idea of self. Consider, for example, the pleasurable
passion of pride Mr. Darcy may take in his beautiful estate:</p>


<table class="cellpad-small centered avoid-break">
<tr>
  <td><em>Cause</em></td>
  <td><em>(quality)</em></td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td><em>Passion</em></td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td><em>Impressions:</em></td>
  <td>Pleasure</td>
  <td>&mdash;(resemblance)&rarr;</td>
  <td>Pride</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>&uarr;</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>&darr;</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td><em>Ideas:</em></td>
  <td>My
<br />
Estate</td>
  <td>&mdash;(causation)&rarr;</td>
  <td>Self
<br />
(Mr. Darcy)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td><em>Cause</em></td>
  <td><em>(subject)</em></td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td><em>Object</em></td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
The same structure can be found in the other indirect passions of
humility, love and hate, as Hume shows in &ldquo;experiments to
confirm this system&rdquo; (T II.2.2 332), in which he varies either
the quality of the cause, or the object related to the idea of the
subject to produce each different passion in turn. For instance, that
which produces pride when connected to self can produce love in
another, as when the beautiful estate excites love in Elizabeth for
Mr. Darcy:</p>


<table class="cellpad-small centered avoid-break">
<tr>
  <td><em>Cause</em></td>
  <td><em>(quality)</em></td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td><em>Passion</em></td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td><em>Impressions:</em></td>
  <td>Pleasure</td>
  <td>&mdash;(resemblance)&rarr;</td>
  <td>Love</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>&uarr;</td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>&darr;</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td><em>Ideas:</em></td>
  <td>Mr. Darcy&rsquo;s
<br />
Estate</td>
  <td>&mdash;(causation)&rarr;</td>
  <td>Mr. Darcy
<br />
(another)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td><em>Cause</em></td>
  <td><em>(subject)</em></td>
  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td><em>Object</em></td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
Similarly, Elizabeth&rsquo;s dreadful relations may excite humility in
Elizabeth and &ldquo;hate&rdquo; in Mr. Darcy.</p>

<p>
As these examples show, the objects of the indirect passions Hume
discusses are persons: either self or other. Our experience of the
passions of pride or humility, love or hate directs us towards the
relevant person, who appears qualified by the cause of the passion.
For this reason, those distinct causes must be closely associated with
ideas of self or other. The causes must also be hedonically-qualified,
but otherwise can be wildly diverse &ndash; property, character traits,
virtues, or any other &rsquo;eminent&rsquo; feature. The passion,
however, is structured so that we experience them as belonging to the
relevant person for good or ill. The indirect passions thus go far
beyond what bare ideas can provide: they give us a robust, value-laden
sense for persons as bearers of various salient traits and relations
(see further Ainslie 1999).</p>

<p>
In this context, it is noteworthy that Hume begins his discussion with
pride. Its role for Hume may bear comparison to the importance
&ldquo;glory&rdquo; held for Hobbes, although they are clearly not the
same passion. Almost anything that invokes pleasurable impressions can
be the cause of pride, within the limitations that the idea of the
subject must allow us to build associative connections directing the
mind to the idea of self. The idea of self seems, however, to be
intrinsically attention-grabbing, which explains why love for another
somehow connected to us readily converts into pride, but not
vice-versa (so I may readily feel pride when considering my
children&rsquo;s many accomplishments, but consideration of my own
accomplishments does not tend to provoke love for my children).
Against the &ldquo;monkish&rdquo; preference for humility, Hume
emphasizes that virtue itself can be a just cause of pride, one that
becomes all the more powerful as our passions reverberate socially
through the mechanism Hume calls &ldquo;sympathy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Perhaps the most curious feature of pride is its indispensable
relation to the idea of self. The penultimate chapter of Book I of the
<em>Treatise</em> (I.4.6) advances a highly skeptical account of the
idea of self, maintaining that we have no such simple idea, but at
best the idea of an organized bundle: a &ldquo;kind of theatre, where
several perceptions successively make their appearance; pass, re-pass,
glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and
situations,&rdquo; without even &ldquo;the most distant notion of the
place, where these scenes are represented&rdquo; (T I.4.6 253). Hume
seems to find this a distressing thought, but allows that we
&ldquo;must distinguish betwixt personal identity, as it regards our
thought or imagination, and as it regards our passions or the concern
we take in ourselves&rdquo; (T I.4.6 253). The introduction of the
passion of pride, with its essential focus on self, shortly thereafter
may bear this distinction out. Indeed, pride seems both to require
reference to an idea of the self, and to buttress whatever meager idea
we may already have by directing the mind to an idea of the self
outfitted with various pleasurable associations. Hume needs some trick
to fortify the idea of the self, because he will rely on our
possession of a lively idea of the self, one that will serve as a
source of vivacity, for his account of the sympathetic communication
of passions.</p>

Sympathy is not itself a passion; it is not the passion of
&ldquo;pity,&rdquo; nor of &ldquo;compassion.&rdquo; Rather, it is a
causal mechanism, whereby we come to feel the passions we suppose
others feel. In its simplest form, it starts with an observation of
the outward signs of a passion in another (e.g., facial expressions,
behavior, talk), from which we form an idea of, indeed a belief in,
the existence of some passion. Sympathy vivifies that idea into an
impression, that is, a passion, by borrowing from the ever-present,
and lively sense of self. We do need some sort of associations between
the idea of the other and the idea of self for this transfer of
vivacity to work. But they are easy to come by: any sort of relation
between another person &ndash; contiguity, causation, or even simple
resemblance &ndash; can grease the associative wheels whereby an idea
of another&rsquo;s passion becomes a genuine passion in us.</p>

<p>
Hume&rsquo;s account owes a great deal to Malebranche&rsquo;s account
of the mechanical communication of passions (see
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotions-17th18th/LD4Malebranche.html#SocChaPas">Malebranche on the Emotions, sections 8 &amp; 9</a>).
 But Hume does not assume that sympathy produces exactly the same
passion in us as we imagine in another, particularly because the
transfer may alter the object of the passion. For instance, sympathy
can convert the love and admiration others feel for us into pride;
indeed, Hume introduces the mechanism of sympathy to explain our
&ldquo;love of fame,&rdquo; even in cases when we expect no particular
advantage from our admirers and take no other interest in their
opinions. To be sure, the love of fame still represents a
communication of &ldquo;like to like,&rdquo; since love and pride are
both pleasurable passions. But Hume elaborates on sympathy to show how
our affective communications can produce very different kinds of
passions (cf., James 2005, Schmitter 2010).</p>

<p>
Comparison is a mechanism similar to sympathy, but it produces
passions with affective tendencies directly opposed to those we
sympathize with in others. It works by invoking another principle,
superadded to the operations of sympathy: &ldquo;<em>that objects
appear greater or less by a comparison with others</em>&rdquo; (T
II.2.8 375). If, for instance, we come, through sympathy, to feel the
unhappy passion of another, we may feel our own (comparatively) happy
non-sympathetic passions all the more strongly. The operations of
comparison, thus, work to increase the pleasurable (or painful)
passions we feel by letting us feel the contrasting painful (or
pleasurable) passions of others (but cf. Postema 2005, Schmitter
2010). Hume uses comparison to explain the possibility of envy, and
even more, of malice, a sort of &ldquo;pity reverst,&rdquo; involving
an &ldquo;unprovok&rsquo;d desire of producing evil to another&rdquo;
(T II.2.8 377). This differs from hate and other simpler passions,
because the desire is unprovoked by any injury or even a desire to
obtain some good for ourselves (other than reaping pleasure from the
comparison). In this respect, Hume parts company with everyone from
Hobbes to Hutcheson, in recognizing the existence of a seemingly
disinterested, anti-social emotion. In general, Hume treats comparison
as producing socially destructive passions, while sympathy produces
sociable ones, but these do not seem to be the inevitable consequences
of each mechanism. And Hume does not seem to assume that the
production of like from like is the only, or even the primary, way in
which the communication of passions promotes social cohesion.</p>

<h3><a name="ReaOugOnlSlaPas">7. &ldquo;Reason Is and Ought Only to Be the Slave of the Passions&rdquo;</a></h3>

<p>
One of the most notorious of Hume&rsquo;s views about the passions
concerns their relation to our practical reason. Hume locates our
motivations in the passions. As noted in
 <a href="#ClaPasBooTre">section 4</a>,
 he treats the will in his discussion of the direct passions,
identifying it as &ldquo;the internal impression we feel and are
conscious of, when we knowingly give rise to any new motion of our
body, or new perception of our mind&rdquo; (T II.3.1 399). If the will
did not determine a person&rsquo;s actions, we would have no way to
trace those actions to their springs in character, which is the
prerequisite for forming moral judgments.</p>

<p>
Hume is particularly concerned with analyzing our practical reasoning,
our reasoning about how to act. Passions are the engine for all our
deeds: without passions we would lack all motivation, all impulse or
drive to act, or even to reason (practically or theoretically). This
gives at least one sense in which &ldquo;reason is, and ought only to
be the slave of the passions&rdquo; (T II.3.3 415). Hume also holds
that the passions are not themselves directly subject to rational
evaluation. In fact, it seems something of a category mistake to think
that they could be either rational or irrational. Passions are
impressions &ndash; strong and lively perceptions with a certain
&ldquo;feel&rdquo; and a direction, or impulse. Reasoning, however, is
a matter of connecting various ideas in order to come to a belief; it
may apply to, or even form, the circumstances under which passions
arise. But reason can generate no impulse by itself.</p>

<p>
On these grounds, many have attributed to Hume a belief-desire model
of practical reasoning, in which our ends are given by passions
(desires). On this view, reason is in the business of producing
beliefs, but our beliefs are relevant only to the means by which we
seek to obtain those ends: they do not determine the ends themselves.
So, reason has only an instrumental use. But whatever its other
virtues, this model does little to explain why reason &ldquo;ought to
be&rdquo; the slave of the passions. It also seems inappropriate to
reduce passions to desires: passions have a great deal more structure
than their attractive or aversive directions, important though those
may be. What seems central to Hume&rsquo;s view is the inertness of
reason, its inability to generate impulses for the mind (see Millgram
1995; for a different view that stresses the inertness of reason and
representational states in general, see Radcliffe 2018). It is the
inertness of reason that drives Hume to adopt a sentimentalist basis
for the origins of our &ldquo;moral distinctions&rdquo; (T
III.1.2).</p>

<h3><a name="SenArtVir">8. The Sentiments and Artificial Virtues</a></h3>

<p>
When Hume turns to our moral &ldquo;sense&rdquo; in Book III of the
<em>Treatise</em>, he largely abandons talk of passions in favor of
&ldquo;sentiment.&rdquo; He still takes it that our sense of the
morality of an action or character is motivating; for one, we tend to
pursue or avoid actions or persons according to how we have judged
them morally. Like Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, Hume also considers our
moral judgments to be directed at persons&rsquo; stable qualities, or
actions insofar as they express durable motivating dispositions, or
character. Moral sentiments underlie moral judgment, by allowing us to
make the distinctions expressed in such judgments. And since they are
also closely related to motives for action, they play the same roles
Hume has marked out for the passions.</p>

<p>
However, Hume&rsquo;s moral psychology also adds important elements to
the analysis of the passions we have already seen. Hume divides
virtues into the natural and the artificial. Both kinds present
puzzles about how they become the objects of sentiments, so that we
feel that they demand approval, or even impose an
&ldquo;obligation.&rdquo; But artificial virtues are particularly
tricky cases, since we have no natural motivation to approve them.
Artificial virtues, such as justice (which Hume understands as
property-justice), or the somewhat simpler example of promise-keeping,
are neither uncommon, nor arbitrary, but they do rest on an
&rsquo;artifice,&rsquo; or social convention. Moreover, however useful
(or pleasant), the practices informed by those conventions may be in
general, particular instances of the behavior they describe may not
be. Keeping a promise, say, to respect a deadline, may not promote
anyone&rsquo;s good. The difficulty for Hume is to explain why &ndash;
despite the artificial foundation of the practice &ndash; we nonetheless
experience moral sentiments toward the practice, even to the extent of
feeling that it imposes an obligation. We might, for instance, feel a
pleasant glow of esteem when someone cleaves to a promise at some
personal cost. More commonly, we tend to feel a pang of disapproval
for instances of promise-breaking or dishonesty; even if circumstances
so conspire that they cause no harm, we feel that they violate an
obligation.</p>

<p>
There are multiple puzzles here: what moves humanity to develop the
practices and conventions of property-justice and promise-keeping in
the first place; how and why we come to experience moral sentiments
surrounding the practices and conventions themselves; and how our
behavior and sentiments can be obligated by the practices and
conventions independently of the consequences in particular cases, and
sometimes even contrary to our own or others&rsquo; interests.
Hume&rsquo;s response is likewise multi-faceted. To explain how
justice is established, he invokes both our natural
&rsquo;interests,&rsquo; or the passions of avidity and care that he
calls &rsquo;affections,&rsquo; but modified through historical
experience and the understanding, as well as by the extension of our
affections through sympathy. Against Shaftesbury and Hutcheson, Hume
denies that we have a &ldquo;strong regard for the public good&rdquo; as
such (T III.2.6 529). But like them, he also denies that we are wholly
selfish. Rather, we have a natural &ndash; and thus estimable &ndash; partiality
for our near relations, feeling greater affection for family than for
strangers. As such, our affections are limited in scope, and in the
face of some scarcity of external goods, can be as much a source of
social conflict as any selfish passion. The solution, Hume declares,
is &ldquo;artifice,&rdquo; or rather &ldquo;nature provides a remedy in
the judgment and understanding for what is irregular and incommodious
in the affections&rdquo; (T III.2.2 489). Through time and experience,
we establish practices of mutual restraint that become conventions of
property &ndash; conventions established slowly and without any express
&ldquo;covenanting.&rdquo; What motivates our behavior in establishing
such conventions are precisely the natural passions that generated
conflict: interest and &ldquo;limited generosity,&rdquo; but mediated by
a greater insight into how to obtain our ends jointly with others. A
similar development explains the introduction of conventions of
promising by avowals or other signs (for further on these and points
below, see Santos Castro 2015).</p>

<p>
By resorting to the historical development of artifices, Hume can
argue that the effects of our practices of justice are in the general
public interest without supposing that we are motivated by either
general benevolence or mere reason: rather our self-interest and
natural affections restrain themselves, as we learn &ldquo;that the
passion is much better satisfy&rsquo;d by its restraint, than by its
liberty&rdquo; (T III.2.2 492). However, this enlightened interest does
not yet explain how we come to see the practices of justice as
imposing a moral obligation, much less an exceptionless,
context-independent obligation. Hume suggests that the moral
sentiments come into play as societies grow to such a size that
obeying the dictates of justice no longer seems like an exchange of
interested practices with familiar others, and so the benefits they
confer are not readily apparent. Instead, we must come to have a sense
of obligation to obey whatever justice decrees. Experience has shown
that the widespread interests advanced by the artifice of justice will
be served only if there are &ldquo;some general and inflexible
principles . . . unchangeable by spite and favor, and by particular
views of private or public interest&rdquo; (T III.2.6 533). The
inflexibility and universality of principles of justice seem to be a
hallmark of how the artificial virtues impose a sense of obligation
directed at condemning breaches, more than praising conformity.
Hume&rsquo;s most telling example, which appears both in the
<em>Treatise</em> and the second <em>Enquiry</em>, is the obligation
imposed on women to preserve their chastity and modesty. These sexual
virtues, Hume explains, are an artifice answering to a supposed social
interest in the paternity of children. But the way that these
obligations work on the imagination expands &ldquo;beyond the
principle, whence they first arise; and this in all matters of taste
and sentiment&rdquo; (EPM 4.7 207, see also T III.2.12 572, and for a
different case T III.2.9 551). The imagination and taste together work
to generalize the obligation of chastity so that it applies to all
women, independently of its usefulness in the particular case.</p>

<h3><a name="GenPoiVieStaAppSen">9. The General Point of View and Standards of Appropriateness for the Sentiments</a></h3>

<p>
The discussion of the general rules surrounding the artificial virtue
of justice introduces another kind of generalization, one which
applies to all virtues. Justice imposes a general obligation because
sympathy gives us a keen sense of how violations of justice might
affect those who suffer from them. That uneasiness becomes a genuinely
moral qualm when our sympathy is extended through what Hume dubs the
&ldquo;general survey&rdquo; (T III.2.2 499). Whereas the original
motive to justice is interest, it is &ldquo;a sympathy with public
interest [that] is the source of the moral approbation.&rdquo; Or as
Hume puts it later, in discussing the virtue of fidelity to promises,
&ldquo;interest is the first obligation to the performance of
promises,&rdquo; and &ldquo;afterwards a sentiment of morals concurs
with interest, and becomes a new obligation upon mankind.&rdquo;
Sympathy with public interest might sound like the general benevolence
Hume rejected in Hutcheson, albeit one that comes a bit late to the
story. And indeed, in the <em>Enquiry Concerning the Principles of
Morals</em>, Hume talks about the need for a &ldquo;sentiment of
humanity&rdquo; whereby we extend our concern beyond narrow interests.
But he also describes the importance of this sentiment for our ability
to take up a common point of view with others (EPM 9.5&ndash;6 SBN 272).
That is what the earlier <em>Treatise</em> emphasizes: simply for our
moral language to be intelligible to each other requires adopting
&ldquo;some steady and general points of view&rdquo; (T III.3.1 581&ndash;2)
that redirect sympathy through general rules to correct for the
idiosyncratic partiality of our particular position. We cannot so much
as identify instances of justice or injustice until we direct our
generous passions beyond their natural bounds, allowing us to approve
of the justice or honesty of diverse people in diverse situations, no
matter their connection to us. To explain how we can do so, Hume takes
sympathy to communicate passions between persons who are not
immediately present to each other by making use of experience and
counter-factual considerations, according to general rules, so that we
can sympathize from a general point of view &ndash; or at least imagine
what it would be like to do so. And so, the artifice of justice need
not harness some general concern we have for everyone; it presupposes
only that we can imaginatively put ourselves in the place of someone
suffering an injustice so as to sympathize with them.</p>

<p>
More generally, it is because they operate from that general point of
view that feelings of approbation or uneasiness qualify as
distinctively moral sentiments, whatever their origins; putting our
affective responses through these mechanisms of generalization gives
them their moral flavor. The resulting sentiments may sometimes be too
weak to counter our less estimable, but more immediate partial
passions. But even if they do not move us to action, such sentiments
typically have &ldquo;sufficient force to influence our taste, and give
us the sentiments of approbation or blame&rdquo; (T III.2.2 499).
Additional motives to buttress our moral sentimensts come from both
&ldquo;the public instructions of politicians, and the private
education of parents,&rdquo; which instill &ldquo;a sense of honour and
duty in the strict regulation of our actions with regard to the
properties of others&rdquo; (T III.2.6 534). These various artifices
explain how our natural impulses towards self-interest and limited
generosity are bent towards the obligations of justice,
promise-keeping and the like. But even our native regard for the
natural virtues must be steered through a general point of view in
order to count as genuinely moral &ndash; so that my sentiments appear not
merely what I like, but what anyone would (and should) approve.</p>

<p>
For this reason, the general point of view figures as a kind of
standard for the experience of sentiments. It both extends the scope
of the sentiments we feel, and corrects them by providing some sense
of what we ought to feel. To be sure, we may continue also to feel
many uncorrected passions, whether prejudices or innocuous preferences
for what is naturally connected to us. Still, whatever their origins,
only feelings of approbation or uneasiness that operate from a general
point of view qualify as distinctively moral sentiments. The general
point of view is not a standard of rationality; rather, it is a
standard of appropriateness. It is that standard that allows us to
shape, cultivate and constrain our sentiments in ways that provide the
sort of stability and reliability that will form the basis for shared
judgment.</p>

<p>
It is a matter of controversy, however, whether the general point of
view alone provides a genuinely normative standard (see, e.g.,
Korsgaard 1999; cf. also Sayre-McCord 1994). It is clear that it
allows sentiments to be coordinated across a society, so that much of
what its members feel will be more or less uniform and generally
accessible, without the vicissitudes to which the uncorrected and
idiosyncratic passions of individuals in peculiar circumstances are
subject. But this may simply mean that the general point of view
levels out sentiments to what is socially average and widely accepted.
Hume does seem to think that we have a standard more robust than mere
social acceptance for our moral sentiments. He also differentiates the
general point of view that is a touchstone for moral sentiments from
the points of view appropriate to other kinds of sentiments and
judgments, such as aesthetic judgments of taste and even seemingly
straightforward perceptual judgments about the world we share with
others. We correct our sentiments and judgments by appeal to various
points of view in those latter cases, which thereby seem to furnish
standards with differing kinds of normativity. This may be clearest in
Hume&rsquo;s musings on the standards of taste.</p>

<h3><a name="JudTas">10. The Judgment of Taste</a></h3>

<p>
The essay &ldquo;Of the Standard of Taste&rdquo; begins by admitting
the &ldquo;<em>de gustibus</em>&rdquo; principle: there is no
disputing taste. In many respects, this simply follows from
Hume&rsquo;s sentimentalist approach to aesthetic judgments: like
moral judgments, they are based on sense and sentiment, not reason.
Nevertheless, we have a real standard for taste, in the taste of a
good judge who is in the correct position for judgment. In part, the
good judge&rsquo;s ability seems a matter of adopting a general point
of view so that the judge is not so prejudiced by peculiarities of her
own position as to be incapacitated for judging as &lsquo;one&rsquo;
generally does. This requirement may disqualify some candidates on
completely circumstantial grounds, even those who might make perfectly
good judges under other circumstances. Parents, for instance, rarely
make good judges of their own children&rsquo;s artworks, even when
they are professional art critics.</p>

<p>
But the good judge must possess specific qualifications, particularly
those of practice and experience in judging. Such experience can help
judges to filter out peculiarities of their own position, that is, to
adopt the general point of view. But it also seems to afford the judge
resources that bear on the judging itself. Particularly important to
the good judge is &ldquo;delicacy&rdquo; in her discernment. Hume
provides an example in the story told by Sancho Panza in <em>Don
Quixote</em> of the feats of two of his ancestors in wine-tasting. On
being presented with what was universally declared a particularly fine
&ldquo;hogshead&rdquo; of wine, both approved of it, except that one
noted a faint touch of leather and the other a tinge of iron. Their
judgments were ridiculed until the hogshead was drained and a key on a
leathern thong was found at the bottom, &ldquo;which justified the
verdict of Sancho&rsquo;s kinsmen, and confounded those pretended
judges who had condemned them&rdquo; (Hume 1985 235). The good judge
should possess the sort of developed perception that allows her to
detect fine differences that may nonetheless be relevant to judgment.
This is not sufficient for good judgment, but is required for
credibility, and can provide a publicly accessible check.</p>

<p>
Hume maintains that &ldquo;the great resemblance between mental and
bodily taste will easily teach us to apply this story&rdquo; (Hume
1985 235). Presumably, he thinks that sensory qualities such as taste
are like moral and aesthetic qualities in that they are secondary, not
inherent properties of things, &ldquo;but belong entirely to the
sentiment, internal or external&rdquo; (Hume 1985 235). But they do
supervene on properties of things, those &ldquo;qualities in
objects,&rdquo; which are fitted by nature to produce the particular
feelings. The good judge, then, like the wine-tasters of the story,
may possess a developed ability to detect those formal qualities in
art works, or to descry whatever properties of people&rsquo;s actions
might be relevant to the formation of our moral sentiments. The good
judge would then be able to justify her judgment by pointing out
salient features of what is being judged that others might miss. A
good judge will thus be a good critic and teacher of appropriate
taste. There is much more to be said about the capabilities of the
good judge, particularly about how they are &ldquo;improved by practice
[and] perfected by comparison&rdquo; (Hume 1985 241). Nonetheless, we
can see that the good judge may provide standards that are neither
completely independent of the sentiments we are equipped to
experience, nor merely hostage to the common run of passions.</p>

<h3><a name="InfLatAut">11. Influences on Later Authors</a></h3>

<p>
Hume&rsquo;s influence on later authors may be most evident in those
features of his approach that differ from previous treatments of the
emotions and moral sense. Certainly, his account of how our sentiments
can be developed historically and socially was important to
Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and his explanation of the standard in our
judgments of taste served as both a model and foil for many later
theorists. Adam Smith seems to have taken some of the issues Hume
raised about the normative standards for moral judgments particularly
seriously in his <em>Theory of the Moral Sentiments</em> (1759). Like
Hume, he considers sympathy to provide the engine for such a standard.
But on Smith&rsquo;s view, sympathy operates less to communicate the
passions we suppose others actually feel than to allow us to imagine
what it would be like to be in their place. Sympathy arises from our
view of the situation that excites it, and puts us in the position of
a spectator on that situation. There are, in fact, a number of such
points of view, but they all seem inherently normative, for what the
spectator considers is what one <em>ought</em> to feel in the
situation, and one form of moral judgment concerns the appropriateness
of an agent&rsquo;s response to the situation. Because we can also
adopt the stance of a spectator on our own sentiments and actions, we
have the resources for evaluating our own emotional reactions; Smith
criticizes the moral sense theory of Hutcheson for disallowing the
importance, and indeed even the possibility of doing so. Smith&rsquo;s
spectator is not exactly the same as Hume&rsquo;s good judge,
especially since the sympathetic spectator occupies a normative
position independently of constructing a general point of view. But
the highly idealized spectator and the sorts of normative checks that
can be provided by adopting somewhat different spectator positions can
be seen as a response to and development of Hume&rsquo;s analyses of
the interactions of our sentiments in creating the general point of
view and standards for judgment.</p>

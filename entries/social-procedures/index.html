<h1>Formal Approaches to Social Procedures</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Sep 8, 2014; substantive revision Thu Nov 7, 2019</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Social procedures that have algorithmic aspects can often be improved
by redesign. This holds for voting and other peaceful decision making
procedures, for match-making, for auctioning, for fair division of
estates, and for many procedures of distributive justice. The
algorithmic aspects can be analyzed with formal methods. The term
&ldquo;social software&rdquo; was coined by Rohit Parikh (2002)
for the emerging interdisciplinary
enterprise that is concerned with the design and analysis of
algorithms that regulate social processes. Such analysis and
(re-)design uses methods from logic, game theory and theoretical
computer
 science.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 The goals of research in formal approaches to social procedures are
modeling social situations, developing theories of correctness, and
(re-)designing social procedures, ideally leading to new social
behavior.</p>

<p>
Logic, game theory and computer science are not the only disciplines
that have something to say about social mechanisms. Such mechanisms
are also an object of study in voting theory, in auction theory, in
social choice theory, in social epistemology, in mechanism design
theory, and in algorithmic game theory. Multi-agent interaction at a
more abstract level is studied in artificial intelligence and
distributed computing, so all these disciplines have something to say
about the formal analysis of social interaction.</p>

<h2><a id="SocProAlg">1. Social Procedures as Algorithms</a></h2>

<p>
Social software cannot be seen as a clearly defined research field on
its own, but rather an umbrella for certain types of research in
computer science, logic, and game theory. Nevertheless, the social
software perspective on social procedures and intelligent interaction,
emphasizing algorithms and information, has already produced a wide
variety of important insights. In this article, a number of examples
will be discussed and pointers will be given to related discussions in
philosophy.</p>

<p>
The prototypical example of an <em>algorithm</em> in
mathematics (see also entry on
 <a href="../computability/index.html">computability and complexity</a>)
 is Euclid&rsquo;s recipe for finding the greatest common divisor
(GCD) of two positive whole numbers \(A\) and \(B\). The GCD of two
numbers is the greatest number that divides both numbers without
residue.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If \(A\) is larger than \(B\), then replace \(A\) by \(A - B\),
otherwise, if \(B\) is larger than \(A\), replace \(B\) by \(B - A\).
Continue like this until \(A\) equals \(B\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The final \(A = B\) yields the greatest common divisor of the numbers
\(A\) and \(B\) that you started with. For instance, suppose you start
the algorithm with \(A = 20\), \(B = 12\). Then in the first step,
\(A\) gets replaced by \(20 - 12 = 8\), so \(8\) becomes the new
\(A\). In the second step, \(B\) gets replaced by \(12 - 8 = 4\), so
\(4\) becomes the new \(B\). In the third step, \(A\) gets replaced by
\(8 - 4 = 4\), so \(4\) becomes the new \(A\) and the two numbers
\(A\) and \(B\) have become equal. The algorithm yields \(4\) as the
GCD of \(20\) and \(12\).</p>

<p>
Euclid&rsquo;s recipe is <em>formal</em>, and we can
analyze it with formal means. The correctness of Euclid&rsquo;s
algorithm follows from the insight that if you have two numbers \(A\)
and \(B\) with \(A\) larger than \(B\), and you replace \(A\) by \(A -
B\), then the set of common divisors of the number pair does not
change.</p>

<p>
Algorithms come in many forms and flavors, for example, sequential and
parallel ones. For interesting introductions to algorithms in computer
science, see Harel &amp; Feldman (2004) and Miller &amp; Boxer (2012).
In a similar manner as these algorithms, social procedures can be
analyzed with the formal tools of logic and theoretical computer
 science.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
It appears that most amenable to a formal approach are those social
procedures for which one wants to guarantee that given certain
starting conditions, the procedure preserves or creates specific
desired properties. Examples are social procedures for fair division
(Section
 <a href="#Fai">2</a>),
 matching (Section
 <a href="#StaMarPro">3</a>),
 communication (Section
 <a href="#LogCom">4</a>).
 Finally, the formal perspective is useful for situations requiring
participants&rsquo; strategic reasoning (Section
 <a href="#StrReaCoo">5</a>).
 A common element is that in all these situations, agents&rsquo;
knowledge and lack of knowledge of other agents&rsquo; mental states
play an important role. As a counterpart to the examples in the
current article, Van Benthem (2018) provides an intriguing overview
about the current roles of social perspectives in computer science
itself, highlighting social agency and information. </p>

<h2><a id="Fai">2. Fairness</a></h2>

<p>
Formal methods by themselves do not solve philosophical issues, as the
following tale from Padma (2007)
illustrates.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Two farmers, Ram and Shyam were eating chapatis. Ram had 3 pieces of
the flat, round bread and Shyam had 5. A traveller who looked hungry
and tired rode up to the two men. Ram and Shyam decided to share their
chapatis with him. The 3 men stacked the 8 chapatis (like pancakes)
and cut the stack into 3 equal parts. They shared the pieces equally
and ate until nothing was left. The traveller, who was a nobleman, was
so grateful that he gave the two farmers 8 gold coins for his share of
the food.</p>

<p>
After the traveller left, Ram and Shyam wondered how they should share
the 8 gold coins. Ram said that there were 8 coins and only 2 people,
so each person should get an equal share of 4 coins. &ldquo;But
that&rsquo;s not fair,&rdquo; said Shyam, &ldquo;since I had 5
chapatis to begin with.&rdquo; Ram could see his point, but he
didn&rsquo;t really want to give 5 of the coins to Shyam. So he
suggested they go see Maulvi, who was very wise. Shyam agreed.</p>

<p>
Ram and Shyam told the whole story to Maulvi. After thinking for a
long time, he said that the fairest way to share the coins was to give
Shyam 7 coins and Ram only 1 coin. Both men were surprised. But when
they asked Maulvi to explain his reasoning, they were satisfied that
it was a fair division of the 8 coins.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here are reasons the participants could have given to explain each
mentioned division as being fair:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
Ram: &ldquo;If the traveller hadn&rsquo;t arrived, we would have
shared the chapatis equally. So it is only <em>fair</em>
if we now share the eight coins equally as well.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Shyam: &ldquo;If the traveller hadn&rsquo;t arrived, you would have
bought one chapati from me at the going rate for chapatis. Now that
the traveller was so generous, the going rate suddenly went up to one
gold coin for a chapati. So your chapatis turned out to be worth three
gold coins and mine five gold coins.&rdquo;</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Maulvi: &ldquo;The traveller has eaten one third of eight chapatis.
Ram had only three chapatis to start with, and therefore he has eaten
\(1/3\) chapati from Ram and \(7/3\) chapatis from Shyam. So it is
only fair if Ram gets one coin and Shyam gets seven.&rdquo;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
A moral of this could be that there is no obviously correct notion of
fairness, in this case, and in many cases. Formal analysis always
starts from an intuition and can help to turn that intuition into a
more precise definition. Then one can check if a given procedure fits
the definition; however, if it fits, that does not show that the
definition is right.</p>

<h3><a id="FaiDiv">2.1 Fair Division</a></h3>

<p>
Social procedures are as old as the world. <em>Divide and
choose</em> (also known as &ldquo;I cut, you choose&rdquo;) is
a procedure for two-person fair division of some desirable or
undesirable heterogeneous good. One person divides the good into what
she believes to be equal shares, and the other person chooses. If the
two participants have different value judgements on parts of the
goods, it is possible that both participants feel that they received
more than 50 percent of the goods. Indeed, let \(X\) be a set
representing the good to be divided. A valuation function \(V\) for
\(X\) is a function from \({{\cal P}}(X)\) to \([0,1]\) with the
properties that \(V(\emptyset) = 0\), \(V(X) = 1\), and for all
subsets \(A\), \(B\), it holds that \(A \subseteq B \subseteq X\)
implies \(V(A) \leq V(B)\) (for explanation of notation, see
supplement on
 <a href="../set-theory/basic-set-theory.html">basic set theory</a>).
 Suppose \(V_m\) and \(V_y\) are functions for my and your valuation
of the contents of \(X\). If \(V_m\) and \(V_y\) are different, this
means that you and I value some items in \(X\) differently. It
follows, as was already observed by Steinhaus in 1948, that there
exists a division that gives both parties more than their due part;
&ldquo;this fact disproves the common opinion that differences in
estimation make fair division difficult&rdquo; (Steinhaus
1948).</p>

<p>
It matters whether the valuations are known to the other party. Such
knowledge can be used to advantage by the one who cuts. First consider
the case that your valuation is unknown to me, and vice versa. Then if
I cut, the best I can do is pick sets \(A, B \subseteq X\) with \(A
\cap B = \emptyset\), \(A \cup B = X\), and \(V_m(A) = V_m(B)\). If
you choose, you will use \(V_y\) to pick the maximum of \(\{ V_y(A),
V_y(B) \}\). It follows immediately that cutting guarantees a fair
share, but no more than that, while choosing holds a promise for a
better deal. So if you ever get the choice between cutting and
choosing in a situation where both parties only know their own
valuation, then it is to your advantage to leave the cutting to the
other person.</p>

<p>
However, if the valuations are common knowledge (see entry on
 <a href="../common-knowledge/index.html">common knowledge</a>),
 the situation is reversed, for then it is more advantageous to take
the role of cutter. As cutter, you can attempt to make a division intp
sets \(A\) and \(B\) with \(A\) slightly more valuable than \(B\)
according to the valuation of the other party, while \(B\) is much
more valuable than \(A\) according to your own valuation.</p>

<p>
The example shows that issues of knowledge and ignorance, are crucial
for analysis of fair division protocols. Epistemic logic (see entry on
 <a href="../logic-epistemic/index.html">epistemic logic</a>)
 can shed much light on many subtle aspects of knowledge and ignorance
in social interactions, and in particular in fair division problems;
for an interesting cake-cutting experiment showing the importance of
knowledge and ignorance, see Kyropoulou et al.
2019. Still, in traditional studies of fair division the role
of knowledge is not taken into account, as is witnessed by the
comprehensive study of &ldquo;cake cutting algorithms&rdquo; in Robertson
&amp; Webb (1998).</p>

<h3><a id="CutCakAmoThaTwoPar">2.2 Cutting a Cake Among More than Two Participants</a></h3>

<p>
In the social choice literature (Brams 2005;
Brams &amp; Taylor 1996) it is common practice to use cake
cutting as a metaphor for a <em>division of a single
heterogeneous good</em>. Dividing a piece of land at
inheritance would be an example. The cake has different toppings that
cannot all be cut into pieces with the same composition: it may have
candied cherries on top that someone likes but another person abhors,
and so on. A cake division is <em>simply fair</em> if
each of \(n\) players feels she received at least \(1/n\) of the cake,
according to her individual valuation of its parts. A procedure may be
simply fair without ruling out the possibility of hard feelings. A
cake division is called <em>envy-free</em> if each person
feels that nobody else received a larger piece. A sure sign of a
division being envy-free is that nobody wishes to trade pieces with
anyone else. It turns out to be very hard to design cake cutting
procedures that are both fair and envy-free. The <em>I cut, you
choose</em> procedure is fair, and it is envy-free simply
because the rest of the cake is a single piece, so there is no
possibility for envy. See the entry on
 <a href="../economic-justice/index.html">economics [normative] and economic justice</a>
 for philosophical discussions of envy-freeness.</p>

<p>
R. Parikh (2002) analyzes the so-called
Banach-Knaster algorithm for cake cutting when the cake has to be
divided fairly among at least three persons, which goes like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I cut a piece intended for myself. All others consider it. If nobody
objects, I get my piece. If someone raises an objection, she has the
right to cut off a slice and put that back with the rest of the cake.
She then asks if she can have the reduced piece. If nobody objects,
she gets it, otherwise someone else takes the knife and reduces the
piece a bit further, and so on, until someone gets the trimmed piece.
Then on to the next round, with \(n-1\) players. When two players are
left, they use the <em>Divide and choose</em>
algorithm.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Parikh&rsquo;s discussion shows how the methods of theoretical
computer science can be used to argue that the procedure is fair. The
key ingredient of the procedure is a loop operation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Continue to trim the piece until there are no further objections about
the size.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Suppose \(r\) stands for the action of trimming a piece of cake and
putting it back with the main part of the cake, according to the
Banach-Knaster algorithm, and suppose \(F(m,k)\) is the proposition
that the main part of the cake is large enough for \(k\) people. Then
surely \(F(m,n)\) holds at the beginning: the whole cake is large
enough for the whole group to begin with. Moreover, Parikh (1983,
2002) uses his game logic to prove that
\(F(m,k)\) is invariant under the action \(r\): If \(F(m,k)\) is true
before \(r\), then it will still be true after \(r\) has occurred.
Clearly, if one can show that \(F(m,k)\) continues to hold through the
algorithm, for \(k\) running through \(n, \ldots, 1\), then this
establishes that the division is
 fair.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<h3><a id="SolJud">2.3 Solomon&rsquo;s Judgement</a></h3>

<p>
A variation on <em>Divide and choose</em> was played by
King Solomon in the famous Judgement of Solomon, in a dispute among
two women who both claimed to be the mother of a child. The full story
is in 1 Kings 3:16&ndash;28. Two women who lived in the same house
both had an infant son. One of the women claimed that the other woman
had stolen her child, after accidentally smothering her own son during
sleep. The other woman denied this and reversed the charge. After
hearing their stories, King Solomon called for a sword and declared
that there was only one fair solution: cut the living child in two and
give both women half of it. Upon hearing this, the true mother cried
out that she was willing to give up the child if it could be spared,
while the fake mother agreed with the judgement. This behaviour
revealed to Solomon who was the real mother, and her child was given
back to her.</p>

<p>
This procedure is not repeatable. As the Bible story puts it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and
they feared the king; for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him,
to do justice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Obviously, in a second similar dispute, both women would exclaim
&ldquo;Give it to her, but let it live!&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Solomon&rsquo;s handling of the situation can be turned into a social
procedure that is repeatable, as follows. Solomon does not call for a
sword, but instead explains to the two women the following procedure.
First he is going to ask the first woman if she is willing to give up
the child. If the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, the dispute is
resolved, with no further questions asked. Otherwise he will ask the
other woman if she is willing to give up the child. Again, if the
answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; the dispute is resolved. If they both
refuse, then the child is his, and then he will allow one of the women
to buy it back, at a price that is to be determined as follows. They
will both write an amount of money on a sheet of paper, without their
names. If the two bids are \(A\) and \(B\), then the price of the
child is set at \(\frac{A + B}{2}\), and fate will determine which
woman is going to get the child at that price, where the other woman
has to pay a small fine. If the two women are rational, one of them
will give up the child when being first asked (see Moore
1992 and Pauly 2005; for philosophical
discussions of rationality, see the entries on
 <a href="../practical-reason/index.html">practical reason</a>
 &amp;
 <a href="../game-ethics/index.html">game theory and ethics</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Both Moore (1992) and Pauly (2005)
discuss the importance of reasoning
about common knowledge and ignorance in the King Solomon cases. For
example, King Solomon is ignorant of who is the real mother, but both
women commonly know from the start who is the true mother, and that
the true mother will therefore bid much higher than the other one.
This makes the procedure safe. Again, epistemic logic and in
particular common knowledge help to shed light on a tricky social
procedure. For a more traditionally philosophical introduction to the
fair division problem, including more extensive explanations of
fairness, manipulability and envy-freeness, see the entry on
 <a href="../economic-justice/index.html">economics [normative] and economic justice</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The next section shows that the perspective of social software can
also shed light on social matching problems. These range from
marriages to the assignment of resident doctors to hospitals, college
admission procedures, and the assignment of students to housing.</p>

<h2><a id="StaMarPro">3. The Stable Marriage Problem</a></h2>

<p>
Suppose equal sets of men and women are given, all of them seeking to
marry someone of the opposite gender, and each man has listed his
preferences for the women by means of a strict ordering, and similarly
for each woman. A <em>stable marriage match</em> is a
one-to-one mapping between the men and women with the property that if
a man prefers another woman over his own wife, then that woman does
<em>not</em> prefer him to her own husband, and if a
woman prefers another man over her own husband, then that man does
<em>not</em> prefer her to his own wife.</p>

<h3><a id="GalShaAlg">3.1 The Gale-Shapley Algorithm</a></h3>

<p>
The computer scientists Gale and Shapley proved that stable matchings
always exist, and gave an algorithm for finding such matchings, the
so-called Gale-Shapley algorithm (Gale &amp;
Shapley 1962):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Initially, all men and all women are free (unengaged).</p>

<p>
Next, in a number of rounds, each free man proposes to the
most-preferred woman to whom he has not yet proposed and ticks her off
from his list. If the woman is free, she accepts, and they become
engaged. If the woman is not free, she compares the proponent to her
current fianc&eacute;. If she likes him better, she dumps the
fianc&eacute; who becomes free again, and the proponent and his woman
of choice become engaged.</p>

<p>
This goes on until all men and women are engaged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As an example, suppose that there are three men \(a, b, c\) and three
women \(d, e, f\), and the lists of preferences are as follows (with
the most preferred one first in the list): \(a: edf\), \(b: {\it
fed}\), \(c: {\it dfe}\), \(d: {\it abc}\), \(e: {\it cda}\), \(g:
{\it acb}\). So \(a: {\it edf}\) means that \(a\) prefers \(e\) to
\(d\) and \(d\) to \(f\). It is assumed that preferences are
transitive, so \(a\) also prefers \(e\) to \(f\).</p>

<p>
An example of a stable match for this situation is represented as
three pairs \((a,e)\), \((b,f)\), \((c,d)\). Note that woman \(d\)
ends up with the man that is at the bottom of her list. But this match
is still stable, for although \(c\) is willing to swap her husband for
any of the other two men, these two candidates will not agree, for
they both happen to be married to the woman who is on the top of their
own list.</p>

<p>
To check that the Gale-Shapley algorithm always produces stable
matchings, we can proceed as follows. Obviously, the situation where
no-one is engaged is stable.</p>

<p>
What does it mean for \(E\), an &ldquo;engagement&rdquo; mapping, to
be stable on the set of women \(W\) and the set of men \(M\)? Let us
use \(m &gt;_w m'\) for &ldquo;\(w\) prefers \(m\) over \(m'\)&rdquo;
(so bigger is better).</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li><span class="tag">(1) <span class="sen">For all \((m,w) \in
E\): if there is \(w'\) with \(w' &gt;_m w\) then there is no \(m'\)
with \((m',w') \in E\) and \(m &gt;_{w'} m'\);</li>

<li><span class="tag">(2) <span class="sen">For all \((m,w) \in
E\): if there is \(m'\) with \(m' &gt;_w m\) then there is no \(w'\)
with \((m',w') \in E\) and \(w &gt;_{m'} w'\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
What does it mean for a man to be <em>free</em>?</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li><span class="tag">(3) <span class="sen">The set of free men
should equal the set of all men minus the men that are engaged.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Next, inspect what happens in a single step in the algorithm. The
precondition for the step is that there is at least one free man \(m\)
left. Such a free man \(m\) proposes to the highest woman \(w\) on his
list to whom he has not yet proposed.</p>

<p>
There are two cases. If \(w\) is free, \(w\) accepts the proposal, and
they become engaged. Is the new set of engaged pairs stable? We only
have to check for the new pair \((w,m)\).</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
Suppose that there is a free \(w'\) with \(w' &gt;_m w\). This cannot
be, for \(w\) is at the top of \(m\)'s list.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Suppose there is \(m'\) with \(m' &gt;_w m\). Then if \(m'\) is
engaged, let us say to \(w'\), this must mean that not \(w &gt;_{m'}
w'\). For otherwise \(m'\) would have proposed to \(w\) instead of to
\(w'\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The new list of free men equals the old list, minus \(m\). This is
correct, for \(m\) just got engaged.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Now the other case: suppose that \(w\) is already engaged. There are
two subcases. In case \(w\) prefers her own current fianc&eacute;,
nothing happens. The resulting list of engaged pairs is still stable.
The list of free men remains the same, for \(m\) proposed and got
rejected.</p>

<p>
In case \(w\) prefers \(m\) to her own fianc&eacute; \(m'\), she
swaps: \((m,w)\) replaces \((m',w)\) in the set of engaged pairs.
Again, it is easy to see that the resulting list of engaged pairs is
stable. Man \(m\) gets replaced by \(m'\) in the set of free men. This
is also correct.</p>

<p>
Note that the Gale-Shapley matching algorithm is hugely favourable to
the party that is doing the proposing. The proposing party gets a
chance to make proposals to any candidate, in order of preference. But
at the start of the procedure the receiving party has to say
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; to any proposal! The result of swapping the roles of
the men and the women in the algorithm will also compute a stable
match, but one that is more advantageous to the women. </p>

<p>
The Gale-Shapley procedure runs in time quadratic in the number of men
and women (see, e.g., Cechl&eacute;rov&aacute; et al. 2005). Pini et
al. (2011) show how participants can easily manipulate the outcome of
the procedure by misrepresenting their true preferences. Fortunately,
Pini et al. also present an alternative procedure for which
manipulation is hard, in that coming up with an individually
profitable misrepresentation of one&rsquo;s preferences is a
computationally complex task.</p>

<p>
The Gale-Shapley algorithm has many important applications, also
outside of the area of marriage brokering; Gale and Shapley themselves
discuss college admission procedures (1962).
The next subsection presents another
application.</p>

<h3><a id="UniHouAssPro">3.2 A University Housing Assignment Procedure</a></h3>

<p>
Using the perspective of social software, Parikh and Pauly (2012)
investigate a variant of the
Gale-Shapley algorithm that is used in the Stanford Housing Draw to
assign students to rooms. The situation is more complex than in the
marriage setting, because students do not give a complete order on all
houses, but only on 8 of them; moreover, they may choose to enter the
Draw in groups. In the housing context, the students turn out to have
an incentive to honestly submit their true preferences: the draw is
<em>non-manipulable</em> for them. However, in theory
they could still strategize about choosing the subset of 8 houses on
which they submit their preferences.</p>

<p>
The issue of knowledge is interesting in this case. Even though the
algorithm can be found on the Stanford webpages, most students and
administrators do not fully understand how it works. Therefore, the
Stanford Housing Draw cannot be assumed as common knowledge among the
students. An interesting phenomenon seems to occur: even while
admitting not to understand the algorithm, most students would say
that they believe it to be fair (Parikh &amp;
Pauly 2012).</p>

<h2><a id="LogCom">4. The Logic of Communication</a></h2>

<p>
Communication protocols are important in distributed computing:
computing with distributed systems, where a distributed system is a
set of computers that are connected through a communication network.
Communication protocols are also interesting from a philosophical
perspective, especially in the context of discussions of the value of
privacy (see entries on
 <a href="../privacy/index.html">privacy</a>
 and
 <a href="../computing-responsibility/index.html">computing and moral responsibility</a>).
 The formal approach can help in answering philosophical questions
such as &ldquo;Does more security automatically lead to less
privacy?&rdquo;.</p>

<h3><a id="ComDisCom">4.1 Communication and Distributed Computing</a></h3>

<p>
In the following example, the inspiration does not only flow from
social problems to formal solutions, but also the other way, from
successful social practices to formal procedures. Many algorithms for
distributed computing are related to social protocols for
communication in everyday life. An example is the use of a
&ldquo;talking stick&rdquo; to regulate discussion and decision making
in a group of peers, with the rules that the talking stick gets passed
around and only the person who is holding the stick is allowed to talk
(Nerburn 1999).</p>

<p>
A computer communication protocol based on this social procedure is
the token ring protocol. A <em>token ring</em> in
distributed computing is a network where each computer is connected to
exactly two other computers in such a way that each computer is
reachable in the network, and where a single &ldquo;token&rdquo;
circulates around the ring-shaped network. Communication can only be
initiated by the current owner of the token.</p>

<p>
Sometimes the token gets lost through computer or network failure. In
such cases the token has to be regenerated, with a guarantee that only
one computer has the token. This problem of regenerating the token in
a token ring is called the <em>leader election
problem</em>. Here is an algorithm for it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Assume that communication takes place clockwise, and each computer can
distinguish its clockwise neighbour from its counterclockwise
neighbour. Assume that all computers have different identifiers
(positive whole numbers) and each computer knows its identifier.</p>

<p>
Each computer sends its identifier around the ring. When a computer
\(c\) receives an identifier, \(c\) compares it to its own. If the
identifier is greater than its own, \(c\) passes it on. If it is less
than its own, \(c\) discards it. If it is equal to its own, \(c\)
declares itself to be the leader.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is not hard to see that this guarantees the computer with the
highest identifier \(i_{\text{max}}\) to become the leader (see Lynch
1996). No assumptions need to be made
about the number of computers in the ring, nor about any computer
knowing anything about the size of the ring or the identifiers of the
other computers. A next stage of the protocol could be for the leader
to send around a request to register as non-leader and halt.</p>

<p>
One further level of abstraction is from distributed computers or
processes to interacting intelligent agents, or multi-agent systems.
These agents can be computers, robots, humans, teams of humans, or
some mix of these. It is commonly assumed that the agents have a
degree of autonomy, that the agents have a restricted local view of
the system as a whole, and that there is no designated controller of
the whole system (see Wooldridge 2002 [2009]).</p>

<h3><a id="ComKnoSocPro">4.2 Common Knowledge and Social Procedures</a></h3>

<p>
Many social procedures are designed to create common knowledge (Lewis
1969; van Ditmarsch et al. 2009; and entry on
 <a href="../common-knowledge/index.html">common knowledge</a>).
 The old-fashioned ritual that takes place when you withdraw a large
amount of money from your bank account and have it paid out to you in
cash by the cashier is an example.</p>

<p>
How and whether common knowledge can be achieved depends on available
communication facilities. Public announcement or publicly observable
ritual (the cashier ritual mentioned above) can create common
knowledge. But, as Halpern and Moses (1984)
proved, message exchange in a
distributed environment, where there is no guarantee that messages get
delivered, cannot. Halpern and Moses use the example of two generals
who are planning a coordinated attack on a city. The generals are on
two hills on opposite sides of the city, each with their own army, and
they know that they can only succeed in capturing the city if their
two armies attack at the same time. But the valley that separates the
two hills is in enemy hands, and any messengers that are sent from one
army base to the other run a severe risk to get captured. The generals
have agreed on a joint attack, but still have to settle the time. So
the generals start sending messages, for example, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
attack at 9:00 AM&rdquo;. But they cannot be sure that the messengers
succeed in delivering their message. And if they get through, there is
no guarantee that the message of acknowledgement will get delivered.
And so on.</p>

<p>
Even if common knowledge is sometimes hard to achieve in practice, it
serves as necessary presumption in regulating society. Roman lawgivers
found out long ago that if citizens within their jurisdiction could
plead innocence because of being unaware of the law, no offender could
ever get convicted. So they invented principles like
<em>Ignorantia legis neminem excusat</em>,
&ldquo;ignorance of the law excuses no one&rdquo;. Societies that
abide by the rule of law have to be organized in such a way that
citizens <em>in principle</em> are in a position to know
the law. The laws have to be properly published and distributed, for
example, by being printed in a government gazette to which every
citizen has access.</p>

<p>
In his book &ldquo;Rational Ritual&rdquo; (2001),
Michael Suk-Young Chwe points out the
importance of the <em>size</em> of groups for which
common knowledge gets established. A brand name that is common
knowledge in a large group is worth a lot of money. Chwe analyzes the
example of advertisements broadcasted during the American football
Super Bowl. He compares the enormous cost of making something common
knowledge by means of such advertisements to the obvious benefits.
Part of the benefit is in the fact that the advertisements create
common knowledge. An important consideration when deciding to buy a
smartphone of a particular brand, for example, is the knowledge that
others are going to buy the same model too.</p>

<p>
Of course in many social situations, you may want to <em>prevent</em>
common knowledge from arising, for example, if you want to keep a
secret from certain others. There are also more interesting cases
where everybody knows some fact, for example that a particular country
possesses nuclear weapons, but where it would lead to political
problems to make this fact common knowledge by making a public
announcement. For a number of such social situations where maintaining
privacy and ignorance are crucial, see van Eijck and Verbrugge (2009).
An interesting recent development is the study of dynamic-epistemic
logic-based <em>epistemic planning</em>, which enables us to
synthesize communication protocols in order to create certain exact
configurations of levels of higher-order knowledge within a group
(Bolander and Andersen 2011, L&ouml;we, Pacuit, and Witzel 2011).</p>

<h2><a id="StrReaCoo">5. Strategic Reasoning and Cooperation</a></h2>

<p>
The large field of game theory is extensively explained in other
lemmas in this encyclopedia (see among others the entry on
 <a href="../game-theory/index.html">game theory</a>).
 This field of research has been very active since the appearance of
the seminal book (Von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944). Similarly, social
choice theory and in particular voting theory (see entries on
 <a href="../social-choice/index.html">social choice theory</a>
 and
 <a href="../voting-methods/index.html">voting methods</a>)
 were already thriving fields of research long before the term social
software came along.</p>

<p>
It is useful to investigate how formal methods and an algorithmic
perspective can help solve societal problems. For example, in the case
of the famous prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma (see entry on
 <a href="../prisoner-dilemma/index.html">prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma</a>)
 it is interesting to try to design policies that make cheating the
other agent less profitable by penalizing it. Notice that this
&ldquo;social software engineering&rdquo; takes place at the
meta-level, on top of the level of the prisoners choosing their
strategies (van Eijck 2015).</p>

<p>
A related recent trend in game theory that is relevant for social
software, is to step away from solution concepts such as the Nash
equilibrium and instead to focus on the process of rational
deliberation: the &ldquo;theory of play&rdquo; (see van Benthem,
Pacuit and Roy, 2011, as well as the entry
 <a href="../logics-for-games/index.html">logics for analyzing games</a>).
 This type of research delineates both the normative principles
guiding the players&rsquo; strategic reasoning, and the psychological
phenomena explaining the differences between predicted and observed
behavior in games (Camerer 2003; Ghosh and Verbrugge 2018; Pacuit
2015; Meijering et al. 2012, 2014; Top et al. 2018).</p>

<p>
In Section 4.2 we briefly discussed the role of the study of knowledge
and belief when analyzing social procedures. In this vein, the field
of epistemic game theory focuses on agents&rsquo; beliefs about other
agents&rsquo; strategies and those agents&rsquo; beliefs about other
agents&rsquo; strategies, and so on, up to the idealized case of
common knowledge among a group of agents that they are all rational
(see the entry on
 <a href="../epistemic-game/index.html">epistemic foundations of game theory</a>;
 Perea 2012; Brandenburger 2014).</p>

<p>
It turns out that in voting theory in particular, it is useful to
design a logic to explicitly model the knowledge that agents bring to
bear when they are voting. It is especially interesting to model what
happens in a group when agents vote strategically by misrepresenting
their own preferences in order to manipulate the outcome (van Eijck
2015; van Ditmarsch et al. 2012).</p>

<p>
In recent years in the research area of multi-agent systems, formal
approaches to social procedures have also been used to help design
actual software, for example for cooperative problem solving in teams,
coalition formation, knowledge fusion, auctions, and negotiations
among software agents (Bulling et al. 2015; Chalkiadakis et al. 2011;
Dunin-K&#281;plicz and Verbrugge 2010; Pauly 2002; Shoham and
Leyton-Brown 2009; Vazirani et al. 2007). This literature is mostly
normative in nature.</p>

<p>
In contrast, another fascinating area of research, evolutionary game
theory (see entry on
 <a href="../game-evolutionary/index.html">evolutionary game theory</a>),
 investigates how features like altruism, social norms, moral behavior
and cooperation could actually have evolved. This area combines both
normative and descriptive work (Axelrod 1984; Bowles and Gintis 2011;
Sigmund 2010). As a particular social software contribution to this
area, G&auml;rdenfors (2012) characterized how much cognition and
communication are required for several kinds of cooperation, from
simple flocking behavior, through reciprocal altruism
(&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll scratch your back if you scratch mine&rdquo;), up
to fully fledged teamwork.</p>

<h2><a id="Con">6. Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>
In conclusion, the formal perspective on social procedures and
intelligent interaction, which emphasizes algorithms and information,
has produced a wide variety of important insights. It has also led to
interesting philosophical discussions. The main challenge for the
future appears to be to unify this currently relatively scattered
field, in which many contributors do not seem to be aware of relevant
work in other subfields.</p>

<h2><a id="Ack">Acknowledgments</a></h2>

<p>
I would like to express my gratitude to Jan van Eijck for the
enjoyable time of writing the first 2014 version of this article
together. Thanks are also due to two anonymous referees for suggesting
several improvements and additions for this updated version. Because
of Jan&rsquo;s retirement a few years ago, the 2019 update of the article
has been made by me (Rineke Verbrugge) and I therefore bear sole
responsibility for any remaining infelicities; please let me know if
you spot any.</p>

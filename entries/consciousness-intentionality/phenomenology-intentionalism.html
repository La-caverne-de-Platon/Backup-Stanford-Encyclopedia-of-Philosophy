<h2>Phenomenology and Intentionalism</h2>

<p>
At this point it may be illuminating to consider how the
intentionalist views surveyed in Section 5, and the
separatism/intentionalism contrast, might relate to the
phenomenologists&rsquo; views surveyed in Section 3. It seems the
latter could all plausibly be regarded as intentionalist, in a broad
sense: much or all of our actual experiences, and/or dispositions for
experience, could not be as they are for us, without our enjoying some
form of intentionality. This is clearest in the cases of Brentano and
Husserl. Even if Brentano does not rule out the possibility of
unconscious intentionality, he seems committed to the idea that our
mental states are invariably presented in consciousness just as the
intentional acts they are. And though it&rsquo;s true that Husserl
(unlike Brentano&mdash;or evidently, Heidegger, Sartre, or
Merleau-Ponty) maintains that there is a non-intentional sensory
<em>component</em> to perceptual consciousness that must be
&ldquo;interpreted&rdquo; to refer to objects, for Husserl the
interpretation of sensation belongs to consciousness no less than does
the sensation interpreted. Husserl also affirms the possibility that
there <em>could</em> be a kind of consciousness too unstructured or
chaotic to make objects apparent to a subject ([1913] 1983 &sect;49).
But clearly he regards this as far from how our experience ordinarily
is in actuality. The attribution of intentionalism is most problematic
in Heidegger&rsquo;s case because of his attitude towards
consciousness. But clearly Heidegger would not endorse a kind of
separatism once widespread in analytic circles, which finds in
perception inner sensory states (exhausting perceptual consciousness)
that can be involved in revealing objects to us only if they receive
some kind of interpretation (see Heidegger 1982, &sect; 9).</p>

<p>
Could any of the phenomenologists named be regarded as
<em>reductive</em> intentionalists in the sense explained above? Do
any try to explain the intentionality of experience wholly in terms of
a prior kind of non-experiential intentionality? The only candidate
would seem to be Brentano, given how he combines the possibility of
nonconscious intentionality with a conception of consciousness as a
special intentional act that takes an intentional act as object. But
it is doubtful this can make him a genuinely reductive intentionalist.
Even though Brentano&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;conscious&rdquo; allows for
the possibility of unconscious (i.e., unperceived) appearings, his
appeal to <em>appearing</em> to explain <em>presentation</em>, which
he takes to be fundamental to intentionality generally, makes it
doubtful he can be seen as explaining intentionality without primitive
resort to phenomenal notions (Brentano [1874] 1973: 81, 198). We might
then also wonder: could any of the phenomenologists named be regarded
as <em>restrictive</em> intentionalists? It seems not. Even when they
recognize that everyday perception exemplifies a kind of
intentionality that is not categorial/predicative, and a kind of
understanding that is not rationative, no phenomenologist seems to
have been drawn to the idea that these <em>exhaust</em> consciousness
in any sense.</p>

<p>
If phenomenologists were intensively concerned with the relationship
of consciousness and intentionality, why, one might ask, were
separatism, and reductive (sometimes restrictive) intentionalisms not
part of their repertoires, seeing how large these loom in analytic
treatments? This difference may be partly because the phenomenologists
would have rejected assumptions that help motivate both separatism and
reductive intentionalism, and along with this the general project of
ontologically subordinating the mental to the nonmental. However,
understanding the relevant divergence in background assumptions would
require much more exegesis and intellectual history. As a start one
might say this. Brentano famously claims that no physical phenomenon
exhibits intentionality (as <em>all</em> mental phenomena do). But
given Brentano&rsquo;s (now idiosyncratic) use of the expression
&ldquo;physical phenomenon&rdquo; specifically for a type of
<em>appearance</em> (so the orbit of an electron would not, for him,
count as a &ldquo;physical phenomenon&rdquo;), it is not exactly clear
how this bears on contemporary physicalism about the mind. In any
case, Brentano&rsquo;s metaphysics and his theoretical aims hardly
invite such an ontology. As for Husserl, he seems to have thought the
anti-psychologism regarding principles of inference that he defended
in his <em>Investigations</em> could be extended to rule out any
attempt to derive the normative implications of epistemology, ethics
and aesthetics from the causal laws of natural science (Husserl [1911]
1965). It seems likely he would have thought this also made futile any
attempt to &ldquo;naturalize&rdquo; intentionality. Finally, the
realist presuppositions of such ontological subordination projects
also sit poorly with the sort of &ldquo;transcendental&rdquo; outlook,
echoing Kant in some respects, embraced by <em>Ideas-</em>era Husserl,
and seemingly, in some form by Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty as
well.</p>

<p>
However, it would be a mistake to assume that these phenomenologists
shared <em>none</em> of the concerns that attracted analytic
philosophers of mind to separatism, and reductive or restrictive
intentionalism. Clearly they also found subjectivity deeply
philosophically challenging. They too aimed to show how to avoid
thinking of understanding as isolated in a private sphere of
consciousness. But unlike many analytic philosophers, they were not
concerned to see consciousness as somehow necessitated by a
fundamental objective reality whose constituents lacked it. So they
did not see the problem of subjectivity as that of how to interpret it
in such a way as to secure this necessitation. Thus phenomenologists
were also not liable&mdash;as were later philosophers of mind&mdash;to
think that cultivating first-person reflection is a hindrance to
metaphysics, to be removed by realizing it can tell us nothing of
substance about experience&mdash;since &ldquo;introspection&rdquo;
works only with empty &ldquo;topic neutral&rdquo; or brutely
demonstrative &ldquo;phenomenal concepts&rdquo;. In fact, that
attitude would appear antithetical to the very practice of
phenomenology. What problems then <em>did</em> the phenomenologists
find in subjectivity, and how were these met?</p>

<p>
We may distinguish two general issues. First, there is the problem of
transcendence&mdash;arguably the basic problem of intentionality for
phenomenology after Husserl. This appears in Husserl and Merleau-Ponty
as the challenge of explaining how a subject&rsquo;s perspectivally
limited experience, nearly constantly in flux, could at the same time
somehow constitute a consciousness of stable objectivity. Husserl and
Merleau-Ponty address this sort of issue by trying to show how,
properly described, and dynamically considered, the perspectival
character of sensory experience actually gives it an
experience-transcending reference. This would seem to serve also as
their argument for intentionalism. Notably, Heidegger conceives of
transcendence rather differently; for him the problem is to say how
intentionality is made possible by our relationship with time
(Heidegger 1982 &sect;&sect;9, 20&ndash;21). He addresses <em>his</em>
problem of transcendence by working out a notion of temporality
(influenced by Husserl on time-consciousness) that purports to explain
how our basic forms of comportment towards entities are possible.</p>

<p>
Subjectivity also raised for phenomenologists a second set of issues,
concerning how to combine a recognition of the peculiarity of
self-understanding with the possibility of understanding others and
participating in communal life. Generally, they tried to show how the
two are not as independent as they may seem. Husserl ([1929] 1960)
purports to link subjectivity closely to intersubjectivity, while
Heidegger ([1927] 1962) tries to explain how a peculiarly
individuating self-consciousness and authenticity can emerge only
against the background of one&rsquo;s prior understanding of social
norms (discussed in connection with &ldquo;<em>das Man</em>&rdquo;).
Sartre ([1943] 1956) addresses the issue in his famous discussion of
how self-consciousness arises in the consciousness of another&rsquo;s
gaze. And finally, Merleau-Ponty ([1945] 2012: II.4) appeals to the
idea that there is a basic, unified understanding of self and other
embodied in our own movements, gestures and postures. (It is unified,
because it is at once subjectively experienced and publicly
recognizable, expressive of self and responsive to others. It is
basic, because it precedes and makes possible both the understanding
of self in reflective judgments, and the understanding of others in
mentalistic explanations of their behavior. )</p>

<p>
We would need to take all this into account to assess any attempt to
map these earlier perspectives onto more recent discussions of
intentionality. However, without taking on such heavy tasks, we might
cursorily remark on a few connections. Again, there are the apparent
affinities between some phenomenologists&rsquo; views and recent
relational views of perception. (But even if, as suggested, some kind
of relationalism is attributable to Husserl, Heidegger, and
Sartre&mdash;and even more clearly so to Merleau-Ponty&mdash;this
would seem to be (as in Schellenberg 2011, 2018) a kind of
<em>intentionalist</em> relationalism.) We also may note parallels
between views found in the phenomenological tradition and recent
embodied or embedded conceptions of cognition. Merleau-Ponty, at
least, resembles their proponents in some respects&mdash;insofar as he
would locate understanding (and thus if you like, in a broad sense
&ldquo;cognitive processes&rdquo;) in our sensorimotor interactions
with the environment, rather than see them as mere effects (or causes)
of representational-inferential processes hidden in the brain or soul,
where the real cognition (understanding) allegedly happens. Heidegger
too has been appropriated as a precursor of contemporary
&ldquo;situated&rdquo; approaches to cognition (see Wheeler 2005 and
Ka&uuml;fer and Chemero 2015). Husserl and Merleau-Ponty both inspire
Evan Thompson&rsquo;s (2007) articulation of an explicitly
phenomenological &ldquo;enactivist&rdquo; account that locates mind
(and consciousness) in one&rsquo;s relationship with the environment.
And some of those who recently have argued in favor of locating
cognitive processes partly outside of our heads, such as Andy Clark
and Alva No&euml;, acknowledge affinities with Merleau-Ponty (even if,
unlike Thompson, they don&rsquo;t engage in the interpretation of his
ideas or identify with the phenomenological movement). Clark and
No&euml; significantly differ, however, on how to place consciousness
in such an account. For Clark (1997), while both belief-states and
cognitive processes (and so presumably in some sense, intentionality)
extend outside of the head into bodily interactions with and states of
one&rsquo;s environment, <em>consciousness</em> remains firmly
&ldquo;skull-bound&rdquo;. For No&euml; (2004, 2009), on the other
hand (somewhat like Merleau-Ponty), in both consciousness and
understanding we reach&mdash;sometimes literally&mdash;out to the
world.</p>

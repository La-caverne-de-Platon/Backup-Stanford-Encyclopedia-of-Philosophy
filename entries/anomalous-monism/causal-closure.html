<h2><a name="CauCloPhyArgForMon">Causal Closure of the Physical in the Argument for Monism</a></h2>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s argument for monism is supposed to be based upon
assumptions&mdash;the interaction, cause-law and anomalism
principles&mdash;each of which, on its own, is consistent with some
version of dualism. Otherwise, the question of monism or dualism will
have been begged at the outset. And the respective version of dualism
must be one the ruling out of which would be a substantive
philosophical achievement. Otherwise, the interest of Anomalous Monism
will have been compromised. As we shall now see, these two constraints
appear to be violated by Davidson&rsquo;s rather innocuous-appearing
invocation of a thesis of the causal closure of the physical:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Causal Closure of the Physical</em>: every physical event has a
physical explanation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this section we look at this thesis and its bearing both on the
argument for monism and, more broadly, the structure of Anomalous
Monism.</p>

<p>
Davidson assumes a version of this thesis when he writes &ldquo;It is
a feature of physical reality that physical change can be explained by
laws that connect it with other changes and conditions physically
described.&rdquo; (Davidson 1970, 222). Davidson is claiming that it
is part of the very nature of the physical realm that every physical
event has a purely physical explanation&mdash;this is constitutive of
the physical domain, a <em>synthetic a priori</em> principle (Davidson
1970, 221). (Given Davidson&rsquo;s openness to the possibility of
strict indeterministic laws
 (<a href="index-2.html#HolArg">4.1</a>),
 a more refined formulation of the closure principle would read
&lsquo;every physical event <em>that has an explanation</em> has a
physical explanation&rsquo;. For simplicity, we will work with the
deterministic version stated above.) With this assumption in place,
Davidson&rsquo;s subsequent denial of strict laws incorporating mental
predicates amounts to denying that there can be more than one fully
adequate and complete (i.e., strict) explanation of any physical
event. Only physical explanations can constitute such explanations of
physical phenomena. This assumption, however, is quite problematic
given Davidson&rsquo;s wider aims of establishing monism. (This has
been pointed out in different ways by McLaughlin 1985, Yalowitz 1998a,
Hancock 2001, Antony 2003.)</p>

<p>
This can be seen by considering the following dilemma: assuming the
interaction principle, to hold that all causally explainable events
have a physical causal explanation entails either that those mental
events which cause physical events are also
physical&mdash;<em>token-identity</em>&mdash;or else that these
physical effects are <em>overdetermined</em> by both physical and
mental events. Only these two mutually exclusive options would square
the interaction principle with causal closure (Antony (2003, 5),
arguing in a similar vein, fails to notice the second option).
Davidson cannot directly embrace the first horn of this dilemma, since
this would eliminate the need for independent argument, appealing to
mental anomalism, to establish the token-identity of those mental
events with physical events. He must, then, acknowledge the
&lsquo;overdetermining&rsquo; dualism of the second horn as an open
question. However, this is the <em>only</em> position available that
neither begs the question about monism nor conflicts with the
assumptions of closure and the interaction principle. It is therefore
the only position that the subsequent argument for monism, appealing
to mental anomalism (and assuming causal closure), would actually rule
out. There would thus be no argument against other forms of dualism
(such as Descartes&rsquo; classic formulation) which denied causal
closure of the physical domain.</p>

<p>
Now, perhaps such dualistic conceptions of mind and nature have lost
some credibility in the present philosophical and scientific climates
(however, are they really any <em>less</em> credible than
&lsquo;overdetermining&rsquo; dualism, which on this view would be
Davidson&rsquo;s central opponent?). However, it would be both
self-defeating and wasteful to give up a general argument for monism
that would ground their rejection by simply assuming closure, which
then rules them out by stipulation. It is also very difficult to
believe that Davidson&rsquo;s <em>only</em> opponent is
&lsquo;overdetermining&rsquo; dualism. It is far more ambitious and
interesting to limit oneself to premises that many forms of dualism
might share (such as the cause-law, interaction and anomalism
principles) and then show that they inexorably lead to monism without
reliance on the more controversial assumption of closure. That is true
of Davidson&rsquo;s argument for monism shorn of any commitment to
causal closure: someone who espouses dualism along with the cause-law,
interaction, and anomalism principles but eschews causal closure is
nevertheless shown by that argument that dualism is inconsistent with
her other commitments.</p>

<p>
It would seem, then, that causal closure should not simply be assumed
in Davidson&rsquo;s setup. Is it entailed by anything necessary to
that setup&mdash;the interaction, cause-law or anomalism principles?
Davidson&rsquo;s talk of the &lsquo;open&rsquo; nature of the mental
domain
 (<a href="index-2.html#PsyAno">2.3</a>)&mdash;the
 fact, expressed in the interaction principle, that some mental events
have physical causes&mdash;may have led him to think that the
&lsquo;closed&rsquo; nature of the physical domain followed directly,
especially given the cause-law principle. But this is false. Notice
first that to hold, as Davidson does, that the mental is an
&lsquo;open&rsquo; system&mdash;that mental events causally interact
with physical events&mdash;does not by itself entail that the physical
is &lsquo;closed&rsquo; in the sense that every causally explainable
physical event has a physical cause. More importantly, even with the
cause-law principle in place, the openness of the mental does not
entail that the physical domain (or any other domain, for that matter)
is closed. Closure also depends partly upon whether mental anomalism
is true. The latter&rsquo;s falsity&mdash;the existence of strict
psychophysical laws of succession&mdash;together with the cause-law
and interaction principles is compatible with there not being a
physical cause for every causally explainable physical event.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, even if the interaction, cause-law and anomalism
principles are all true, that still does not entail physical causal
closure. There are events other than mental ones that are picked out
in a non-physical vocabulary (e.g., biological events) and that cause
physical events. Mental anomalism and monism do not entail anything
about biology&rsquo;s nomic or ontological status, and so it is
consistent with Anomalous Monism that not all physical events have
physical causes (Crane 1995 fails to see this point). Therefore,
neither the interaction nor the cause-law principles (even together
with the anomalism principle) entails causal closure. If causal
closure is to figure in the arguments for anomalism or monism, it can
do so only as a primitive assumption relative to these other
premises.</p>

<p>
We now need to ask about the <em>motivation</em> for assuming causal
closure. What work does it do that might be worth the price of letting
go of the more general argument against dualism? Now, the clearest
appearance of the causal closure thesis comes when Davidson is
offering the official argument for the anomalism principle (Davidson
1970, 222). Rationality is there cited as the constitutive feature of
the mental, while closure is cited as the constitutive feature of the
physical. And it is then claimed that these disparate commitments
ground the anomalism principle (see
 <a href="index-2.html#RatArg">4.2</a>).
 Clearly the structure of this sort of argument requires some
characterization of the essence of the physical, in contrast to the
mental, and Davidson&rsquo;s strong commitment to causal closure may
have led to its invocation here, due to a lack of alternatives. (He
nonetheless insists that it does not provide a <em>criterion</em> of
the physical (Davidson 1970, 211)). But in any case, since an
assumption of closure conflicts with the aims of establishing monism,
and otherwise would appear question begging, it is probably best left
as a conclusion to be derived rather than as playing any supporting
role in establishing Anomalous Monism.</p>

<p>
Without the assumption, however, the question arises as to how to
demarcate the mental and physical vocabularies. Without such a
demarcation in hand, it can appear difficult to state what exactly is
at issue when it is asked whether there can be strict psychophysical
laws in particular. How can we recognize such a purported law without
knowing what makes something a physical (or mental) predicate? As
noted above
 (<a href="index-2.html#MenPhyEve">2.1</a>),
 Davidson despairs of the possibility of an intuitively adequate
definition of the mental. However, he allows, for his purposes of
establishing monism, a criterion in terms of
intentionality&mdash;having a propositional content. And this
criterion of the mental then allows us to pick out the
&lsquo;physical&rsquo; by exclusion, without need of a positive
criterion like causal closure (Davidson 1970, 211). So the
vocabulary-individuation problem does not appear significant enough,
even by Davidson&rsquo;s own lights, to motivate the assumption of
physical causal closure.</p>

<p>
The assumption of causal closure thus conflicts with many of
Davidson&rsquo;s aims and procedures in arguing for Anomalous Monism.
And, as we have seen, the assumption is not required in order to
establish mental anomalism
 (<a href="index-2.html#PreIIIAnoPri">4</a>).
 However, we have also seen that causal closure does appear to play a
role in Davidson&rsquo;s actual derivation of token-identity&mdash;it
allows him to identify the further property that causally interacting
mental events must instantiate as &lsquo;physical&rsquo;
 (<a href="index-2.html#TokIde">5.1</a>).
 On some readings of the anomalism principle, however, this role can
be eliminated (see
 <a href="index-2.html#CauDefArg">4.3</a>,
 and Yalowitz 1998a). Thus, although there is ample reason for setting
the causal closure thesis aside from the general framework within
which the argument for Anomalous Monism takes place, its ultimate
status is unclear. (For discussion of how causal closure may itself be
deduced from Davidson&rsquo;s framework once Anomalous Monism is in
place, see Yalowitz 1998a, 225.)</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Religion and Political Theory</a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>
Strauss borrows
the phrase from Spinoza. Smith (2006) lucidly explores Strauss'
views.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>
It proves tricky
to distinguish religious from secular reasons. For our purposes,
we'll assume that a secular reason is a set of claims that does not
include among its members any claim that has more or less explicit
theistic content, such as the claims <em>that God exists</em>, <em>that
the Bible has been inspired by God</em>, or <em>that the Pope
accurately represents the divine will</em>. A religious reason,
by contrast, is a set of claims that does include as a member a claim
that has such content. Far more complicated is what to make of
the concept of a &ldquo;plausible&rdquo; or &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; secular rationale.
Advocates of the standard position have articulated widely varying
accounts. We broach this issue in the next section.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>  Three clarifying points:
first, the DRR has been formulated in importantly different ways. In
this essay, we consider what we take to be one of its most plausible
formulations. Second, there is conceptual space for the view that
coercive legislation requires the support of both religious and
secular reasons. Since this view goes undefended, we will not explore
it. Finally, there are correlates of the DRR that apply to occupants
of social roles other than being a citizen. For example, there are
correlates of the DRR that we could formulate for judges, legislators,
military officers, and other public servants. For simplicity's sake,
we focus on its application to citizens.  That said, some theorists
claim that citizens need not adhere to the DRR, or any relevant
correlate, by virtue of the fact that their causal contribution to the
enactment of coercive state measures is negligible.  For discussion,
see Kevin Vallier, (2014).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>
To be maximally
explicit: we assume that if a citizen believes that she has only a
religious rationale for supporting a coercive law, then she also
believes that she does not have a plausible secular rationale for
supporting that law, which she can offer to other
citizens.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>
Habermas, it
should be noted, gives citizens wide latitude to rely on their
religious convictions in public political discourse, but also advocates
expunging religious intrusions from the legislative record.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>
It is plausible
to hold that the normative standards that apply to the political role
of religious reasons are context sensitive. For example,
religious reasons might play importantly different justificatory roles
in liberal democracies that have relevantly different histories,
traditions, levels of commitment to liberal democracy, and the
like. To keep things manageable, in this essay, we'll have our
eye on liberal democracies that bear a close resemblance to that found
in the United States.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
In that
case, advocates of the DRR might require that citizens have a
sufficiently wide spread of secular reasons, though there is room for
considerable disagreement regarding how wide that spread must be.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>
Mar Aba's
commitment to &ldquo;free faith&rdquo; has been echoed by many and varied religious
thinkers, from the early church fathers Tertullian and Lactantius to
the early modern theorists Sebastian Castellio, John Locke, and Roger
Williams. This free faith argument is a religious argument
insofar as it depends crucially on a claim about what makes for genuine
piety, a claim that some religious traditions have rejected (Digeser,
2000).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>
For an
expression of such a view, see Stout (2004).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>
It is
important to stress, however, that the argument receives other
formulations. For a nice summation, see Boettcher (2007).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>
For a
probing treatment of Qutb's objections to liberal democracy, see
Berman (2003).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>
A point of
clarification: we assume that even laws that protect certain freedoms,
such as the right to religious freedom, are coercive. For such
laws prohibit figures such as Qutb from practicing their religion as
they see fit; they are coercively prevented from, among other things,
implementing shariah code as legally binding.</p>

<p>

 On a different note, it might seem that
figures such as Qutb pose no threat to the standard view. For it
might be claimed that Qutb is not reasonable in the relevant
sense. Why not? To be reasonable in the relevant sense is
to be willing to cooperate with others. And, thus, it is to agree
to fair terms of social cooperation. Since coercion need be
justifiable only to persons who are reasonable in this sense, the
presence of figures such as Qutb does not undermine the legitimacy of
government's coercive enforcement of the right to religious
freedom.</p>

<p>

 Suppose, however, that what leads Qutb to
reject a right to religious freedom has nothing to do with his lack of
concern for fair cooperation and everything to do with a particular set
of background theological commitments that determine how fair
cooperation should take place. According to these background
theological commitments, rejection of a robust right to religious
freedom is essential to social harmony and communal flourishing.
Those who insist on the coercive imposition of that right are a grave
danger to both individual and communal well-being. If this is
correct, it is precisely Qutb's willingness to cooperate with others
that leads him to reject religious freedom.
</p>

<p>

 Advocates of the standard view will not be
satisfied with this response. The fact that Qutb relies in this
way on his religious convictions to determine what counts as legitimate
social cooperation is precisely what they regard as unreasonable.
Suffice it to say that the role that appeals to reasonableness (and
reciprocity) play in these discussions is vexed.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>
Perry
further argues that the inviolability of the person can be defended
satisfactorily only on theistic grounds. Other liberal critics,
such as Stout, however, do not accept this claim.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>
Of course,
advocates of the standard view have the option of reformulating the DRR
in a manner that accords to religious and secular reasons exactly the
same justificatory force. According to such a reformulation, a
citizen may support only those coercive laws for which she has, and is
prepared to offer, some spread of reasons that provide all affected
parties with reason that <em>they</em> regard as plausible.
According to this reformulation of the DRR, if a citizen knows that
some of her compatriots have (what they regard as) compelling religious
objections to a given coercive law, and if she cannot meet these
objections, then she should not support that law. She should do
so even if she has a plausible secular rationale for it. As we
say, a version of the standard view that incorporates this
thorough-going impartiality between the religious and the secular is a
theoretical possibility, though we doubt that many advocates of the
standard view will be inclined to embrace it. (So far as we know,
only one has formulated a version of it; see Gaus, forthcoming.)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>
This is what
Rawls calls &ldquo;the proviso&rdquo;: reasonable comprehensive doctrines (and so
religious reasons) may be offered &ldquo;in public reason at any time,
provided that in due course public reasons &hellip; are presented
sufficient to support whatever the comprehensive doctrines are
introduced to support&rdquo; (1993: li-lii).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>
By saying
that the narrative is similar to MacIntyre's, we do not mean to claim
that the New Traditionalists simply borrow their narrative from
MacIntyre. It is true that New Traditionalists such as Hauerwas
borrow liberally from MacIntyre. But, as best we can tell, New
Traditionalists such as Milbank tell a narrative that is not so much
indebted to MacIntyre's as isomorphic with it in crucial
respects.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>
Thus, for
example, Tertullian (2004): &ldquo;It is a fundamental human right, a
privilege of nature, that every man should worship according to his
own convictions: one man's religion neither harms nor helps another
man. It is assuredly no part of religion to compel religion&mdash;to
which free will and not force should lead us&mdash;the sacrificial
victims even being required of a willing mind. You will render no real
service to your gods be compelling us to sacrifice. For they can have
no desire of offerings from the unwilling, unless they are animated by
a spirit of contention, which is a thing altogether
undivine.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>The Slingshot Argument</h2>

<p>
The argument known as the &ldquo;slingshot&rdquo; was specially
designed to provide a formally strict proof of the claim that all true
sentences designate (denote, refer to) one and the same thing.
Moreover, according to the argument, all false sentences designate the
same thing as well. These things are precisely the truth values:
<em>the True</em> and <em>the False</em>. The argument is already
anticipated (implicitly at least) by Frege (see, e.g., Frege 1892:
49), and was first formulated explicitly by Alonzo Church in his
review of Carnap&rsquo;s <em>Introduction to Semantics</em> (Church
1943). Church took the result to show that sentences cannot designate
propositions&mdash;contrary to what Carnap had claimed in his
book.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The slingshot argument&rdquo; is a kind of an umbrella term
covering a broad family of arguments rather than a single line of
reasoning. However, in all its forms the argument essentially rests on
the assumption that every sentence has a designation. Another
important assumption is the principle of <em>Substitutivity</em> for
co-referential terms:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If a sentence is converted into another sentence by substituting any
term for a term with exactly the same designation, the resulting and
the initial sentences also designate the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Church formulates this principle as a demand of
&ldquo;interchangeability of synonymous expressions&rdquo;. This is
actually just an instance of the compositionality principle, according
to which the meaning of a complex expression (when identified with its
designation) is uniquely determined by the structure of this
expression and the meanings (designations) of its components.</p>

<p>
The next assumption, explicitly made by Church in 1943, is the
synonymity of logically equivalent sentences:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">

<dt>(A0)</dt>
<dd>If sentences \(A\) and \(B\) are <em>logically equivalent</em>,
then they have the same designation.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Church makes use of an abstraction operator \(\lambda x\) for
constructing <em>lambda-terms</em> of the form \(\lambda x X\)
understood as &ldquo;the class of all \(x\) such that \(X\)&rdquo;
(1943: 299), and considers the following three sentences (where \(A\)
is true):</p> 

\[
\begin{align}
A \tag{Ch1}\\
\lambda x (x = x \wedge {\sim}A) &amp;= \lambda x (x \neq x) \tag{Ch2}\\
\lambda x (x \neq x) &amp;= \lambda x (x \neq x)\tag{Ch3}
\end{align}
\]

<p>
Clearly, Ch2 is true, because \({\sim}A\) is false, and hence,
\(\lambda x (x = x \wedge {\sim}A)\) and \(\lambda x (x \neq x)\)
denote then one and the same object, namely the empty class. Moreover,
Ch1 and Ch2 cannot differ in their truth-value, and thus, are
logically equivalent. Indeed, if Ch1 is true, Ch2 must also be true as
stated above. If Ch1 is false, then \({\sim}A\) is true, hence
\(\lambda x (x = x \wedge {\sim}A)\) does not designate the empty
class, and thus Ch2 must be false. By (A0), Ch1 and Ch2 must have one
and the same designation. By substitutivity, the designation of Ch2
and Ch3 is also the same. Thus, Ch1 and Ch3 must designate the same
thing if any. \(A\) is arbitrary, and hence, we can restate
Ch1&ndash;Ch3 by taking any other true sentence \(B\) instead of
\(A\). Since the designation of \(A\) is the same as the one of Ch3,
it is also the designation of \(B\). As the result we get that any two
true sentences \(A\) and \(B\) must designate one and the same thing
(&ldquo;be synonymous&rdquo;). This means in particular that \(A\) and
\(B\) cannot designate propositions, since the propositions
corresponding to \(A\) and \(B\) are certainly not the same in
general. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
By a similar method any two false sentences can be shown to be
synonymous. Therefore finally no possibility remains for the designata
of sentences except that they be truth-values. (Church 1943: 300)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It seems that Carnap found this argument convincing enough: in his
next book (1947: 26) he <em>did</em> postulate truth values as
&ldquo;extensions&rdquo; of sentences and, moreover, provided
independent reasons for this. It should be noted, however, that the
evidential value of the argument depends heavily on the acceptance of
its assumptions&mdash;Substitutivity and (A0) in this version. Both
these assumptions have been frequently criticized by different
authors. In particular, Barwise and Perry (1981) reject them on the
basis of their situation semantics. For a critical discussion of these
principles, see also Bennett 1988, Neale 2001, Searle 1995, and Taylor
1985.</p>

<p>
A rather informal and pedagogically more comprehensible
textbook-version of the argument from Church 1956:
24&mdash;25&mdash;presented by items C1&ndash;C4 in the main body of
this entry&mdash;does not use assumption (A0). Yet, it relies on
another principle called <em>redistribution</em>: &ldquo;Rearrangement
of the parts of a sentence does not effect what it designates, as long
as the truth conditions remain the same&rdquo; (Perry 1996: 100). This
principle may seem controversial. Moreover, Barwise and Perry (1981:
396&ndash;397) argue that it is incompatible with Substitutivity, and
thus, taking them together appears to be problematic.</p>

<p>
Note that the sequence C1&ndash;C4, as well as the sequence Ch1-Ch3
above, does not constitute a logical inference in a strong sense. It
is rather a number of conversion steps each producing co-referential
sentences. However, the argument can be re-articulated as a formal
derivation by applying suitable technical machinery.</p>

<p>
An appropriate opportunity for such a strict deductive formalization
is given with a version of the argument sketched by G&ouml;del in
1944: 128&mdash;129, where he highlights the impact of various
theories of descriptions on the problem of what sentences designate.
According to G&ouml;del, if&mdash;in addition to
substitutivity&mdash;we take the apparently obvious view that a
descriptive phrase denotes the object described, then the conclusion
that &ldquo;all true sentences have the same signification (as well as
all false ones)&rdquo; is almost inevitable. G&ouml;del hints at a
&ldquo;rigorous proof&rdquo; of this claim by making use of some
further assumptions. Let \((\iota x)(x=a \wedge Fx)\) stand for the
definite description &ldquo;the \(x\) such that \(x\) is identical to
\(a\) and \(x\) is \(F\)&rdquo;, and let for any sentence \(A\), \([ A
]\) stand for what \(A\) designates. Then G&ouml;del&rsquo;s
assumptions can be articulated as follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">

<dt>(A1)</dt>
<dd>\([Fa] = [a=(\iota x)(x=a \wedge Fx)]\).</dd>

<dt>(A2)</dt>
<dd>Every sentence can be transformed into an equivalent sentence of
the form \(Fa\). (This assumption allows G&ouml;del to expand his
argument beyond the atomic sentences, cf. Neale 1995:
778.)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
(A1) is called the &ldquo;G&ouml;delian equivalence&rdquo; by Neale
(2001: 166) and is meant to be a weaker replacement for (A0). (A2)
simply says that any sentence can be put into a predicate-argument
form. This could be illustrated by a transformation of sentences like
&ldquo;Socrates snored and Plato snored&rdquo; into &ldquo;Socrates is
an \(x\) such that \(x\) snored and Plato snored &rdquo;, see Neale
2001: 130.</p>

<p>
One can reconstruct G&ouml;del&rsquo;s proof in the form of an
&ldquo;official&rdquo; logical inference. (The reconstruction below
stems essentially from Neale (1995: 777&mdash;779, 789), although the
exact formulation is somewhat different). Making use of the introduced
notation, it is possible to prove that for any true sentences \(A\)
and \(B\), \([A] = [B]\). For this an additional rule of inference
governing the description operator will be needed:</p> 

\[
\iota\dd\textsc{INTR}: \frac{A(x/a)}{a=(\iota x)(x=a \land A(x))}
\]

<p>
where \(a\) is a singular term, \(A (x)\) is a sentence containing at
least one free occurrence of the variable \(x\), and \(A(x/a)\) is the
result of replacing every occurrence of \(x\) in \(A(x)\) by
\(a\).</p>

<p>
Note the close connection between this rule and (A1). As Neale (1995:
789) observes, \(\iota\)-<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">intr</span>
(as well as its counterpart rule
\(\iota\)-<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">elim</span>, which
goes in the opposite direction) must be a valid rule of inference in
any (extensional) theory of descriptions (as it is in
Russell&rsquo;s).</p>

<p>
Another inference rule, which allows substitution for definite
descriptions, is also taken from Neale (1995: 787):</p> 

\[
\begin{array}{cccc}
\iota\dd\textsc{SUB} 
&amp; (\iota x)\phi = (\iota x) \psi 
&amp; (\iota x)\phi = a
&amp; (\iota x)\phi = a \\
&amp;\frac{A((\iota x)\phi)}{A((\iota x)\psi)}
&amp; \frac{A((\iota x)\phi)}{A(a)}
&amp;  \frac{A(a)}{A((\iota x)\phi)}
\end{array}
\]

<p>
where in an expression of the form \(\frac{A(y)}{A(z)}\) \(A(z)\) is
the result of replacing at least one occurrence of \(y\) in \(A(y)\)
by \(z\).</p>

<p>
With this machinery at hand, suppose the sentences G1&ndash;G3 below
are true.</p> 

\[
\begin{gather}
Fa \tag{G1}\\ 
a \ne b \tag{G2}\\
Gb \tag{G3}\\
\end{gather}
\]

<p>
Then one can proceed as follows:</p> 

\[
\begin{align}
a&amp;=(\iota x)(x=a \wedge Fx)  \quad\quad \textrm{G1}, \iota\dd\textsc{INTR}\tag{G4}\\
a&amp;=(\iota x)(x=a \wedge x \ne b)  \quad\quad\textrm{G2}, \iota\dd\textsc{INTR}\tag{G5}\\
b&amp; =(\iota x)(x=b \wedge Gx)  \quad\quad\textrm{G3}, \iota\dd\textsc{INTR}\tag{G6}\\
b&amp;=(\iota x)(x=b \wedge a \ne x)  \quad\quad\textrm{G2}, \iota\dd\textsc{INTR}\tag{G7}\\
(\iota x)(x=a \wedge Fx)&amp; =(\iota x)(x=a \wedge x \ne b) \quad\quad\textrm{G4, G5}, \iota\dd\textsc{SUB}\tag{G8}\\
(\iota x)(x=b \wedge Gx)&amp; =(\iota x)(x=b \wedge a \ne x)  \quad\quad\textrm{G6, G7}, \iota\dd\textsc{SUB}\tag{G9}\\
[Fa] &amp; = [a=(\iota x)(x=a \wedge Fx)]  \quad\quad\textrm{(A1)}\tag{G10}\\
[a \ne b] &amp; = [a=(\iota x)(x=a \wedge x \ne b)] \quad\quad\textrm{(A1)}\tag{G11}\\
[Fa] &amp; = [a=(\iota x)(x=a \wedge x \ne b)]  \quad\quad\textrm{G8, G10}, \iota\dd\textsc{SUB}\tag{G12}\\
[Fa] &amp; = [a \ne b]     \quad\quad \text{G11, G12}, \textit{Transitivity of} =\tag{G13}\\
[Gb] &amp; = [b=(\iota x)(x=b \wedge Gx)]  \quad\quad\textrm{(A1)}\tag{G14}\\
[a \ne b] &amp; = [b=(\iota x)(x=b \wedge a \ne x)] \quad\quad\textrm{(A1)}\tag{G15}\\
[Gb] &amp; = [b=(\iota x)(x=b \wedge x \ne a)]  \quad\quad\textrm{G9, G14}, \iota\dd\textsc{SUB}\tag{G16}\\
[Gb] &amp; = [a \ne b]  \quad\quad\textrm{G15, G16}, \textit{Transitivity of} =\tag{G17}\\
[Fa] &amp; = [Gb]  \quad\quad\textrm{G13, G17}, \textit{Transitivity of} =\tag{G18}\\
\end{align}
\]

<p>
The inference can be easily repeated if instead of G2 we take its
non-negated form \(a=b\). That is, in any case (in view of the
assumption that sentences do designate) \(Fa\) and \(Gb\) must have
one and the same designation. But \(Fa\) and \(Gb\) may be completely
different sentences having nothing (of semantic relevance) in common,
except that they are both true, as had been assumed, such as
&ldquo;Socrates is wise&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mount Everest is
high&rdquo;. Then, taking into account the assumption (A2), one can
easily extend this claim to any true sentences \(A\) and \(B\).</p>

<p>
The paper where G&ouml;del put forward his argument was published in a
volume from the &ldquo;Library of Living Philosophers&rdquo; devoted
to Bertrand Russell. As is well known, Russell considered facts to be
<em>meanings</em> of true sentences, so that, e.g., &ldquo;Socrates is
mortal&rdquo; means a certain fact, see Russell (1992 [1918,1919]:
186). In this case the argument above would demonstrate that all true
sentences mean one and the same fact, reducing thus Russell&rsquo;s
view to an absurdity.</p>

<p>
Therefore, the slingshot argument sometimes has been characterized as
a &ldquo;collapsing argument&rdquo;, for what it admittedly shows is
that there are fewer entities of a given kind than one might suppose
(Neale 1995: 761). In this sense the argument can be equally used to
show that sentences do not designate situations, states of affairs or
anything of the sort, leading any attempt to assume so to a breakdown
of the class of supposed designata &ldquo;into a class of just two
entities (which might as well be called &lsquo;Truth&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Falsity&rsquo;)&rdquo; (Neale 1995: 761). Another famous
argument of this kind is due to W.V. Quine (see 1953, 1960), who
intended to demonstrate that quantifying into modal contexts leads to
a collapse of modality.</p>

<p>
As G&ouml;del in contrast to Church offers only a rough outline of his
argument, one can find in the literature several different supposedly
authentic reconstructions of G&ouml;del&rsquo;s proof, and it is not
easy to see which one of them reproduces G&ouml;del&rsquo;s line of
reasoning more accurately than the others. However, such
reconstructions, being different in the assumptions involved or in
their technical implementation, all end up with the same conclusion.
It should be understood, that questioning these assumptions, and more
concretely, the supposed applicability of the rules
 \(\iota\)-<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">intr</span>
and \(\iota\)-<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">sub</span>
in a particular context
can undermine the certainty of this conclusion. For a critical
discussion of these rules in connection with G&ouml;del&rsquo;s
slingshot, see Neale 2001, Oppy 1997, and Stoutland 2003.</p>

<p>
An explicit feature of G&ouml;del&rsquo;s slingshot, besides replacing
(A0) with the less controversial (A1), is the use of an arbitrary
object \(a\) (rather than a class abstract or definite description),
and considering it to be the object which has some property and is
identical to \(a\). Interestingly, if one returns to the stronger
assumption (A0) maintained by Church and considers equivalent
transformations of G&ouml;delian expressions like \(a=(\iota x)(x=a
\wedge Fx)\), then one obtains another, very simple (even simplified)
version of the slingshot which&mdash;though not exactly
G&ouml;delian&mdash;is clearly inspired by G&ouml;del&rsquo;s ideas.
Moreover, this version (see, e.g., MacFarlane 2002) is to some degree
intermediate between G&ouml;del&rsquo;s original argument and the ones
developed by Church and Davidson.</p>

<p>
Namely, let \(R\) and \(T\) be any true sentences and \(a\) be some
term which has a designation. Then we have the following four
sentences which all have the same designation:</p> 

\[
\begin{gather}
R\tag{S1}\\
a=(\iota x)(x=a \wedge R) \tag{S2}\\
a=(\iota x)(x=a \wedge T) \tag{S3}\\
T\tag{S4}
\end{gather}
\]

<p>
Indeed, S1 and S2 are logically equivalent. As Stoutland (2003:
15&ndash;16) observes, since \((\iota x)(x=a \wedge R)\) has as its
reference the unique object \(x\) such that \(x = a\) and \(R\), then
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if \(R\) is true, this will simply be the unique object such that \(x
= a\); but if \(R\) is false, there will be no such thing as the
unique object such that \(x = a\) and \(R\). (notation adjusted) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The same holds for S3 and S4. Now, because \((\iota x)(x=a \wedge R)\)
and \((\iota x)(x=a \wedge T)\) designate one and the same object,
namely \(a\), by substitutivity, S2 and S3 also designate the same
object. Hence, S1 and S4 must have the same designation as well. And
there is nothing left but taking it to be their truth value.</p>

<p>
Davidson used his own version of the &ldquo;slingshot&rdquo; (see the
supplementary document to the entry &ldquo;Facts&rdquo;) to undermine
a widespread view that true sentences correspond to facts. The line of
reasoning in accordance with the slingshot schema forces us to admit
then that all true sentences refer to one and the same fact, which
Davidson (1969), nimbly enough, calls <em>The Great Fact</em>. This
conclusion is often employed to make a case against the correspondence
theory of truth. The idea is that facts&mdash;when related to a
sentence&mdash;appear to be non-localizable, and thus any true
sentence seems to correspond to the whole universe rather than to some
of its &ldquo;parts&rdquo;. As it was suggested by C.I. Lewis (1943:
242), a proposition refers then not to some limited state of affairs,
but to the &ldquo;kind of <em>total</em> state of affairs we call a
world&rdquo;. And further: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
All <em>true</em> propositions have the same extension, namely, this
actual world; and all <em>false</em> propositions have the same
extension, namely, zero-extension. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such an understanding is especially congenial to the Fregean account
of truth values.</p>

<p>
We conclude with the following observation by Frederick Stoutland
(2003: 4): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Although the slingshot can be made rigorously valid, its conclusion
can be evaded by challenging one or more of its assumptions, not all
of which are by any means self-evident. At the same time, reflection
on these assumptions sheds a great deal of light on philosophical
questions, and anyone who thinks about issues like truth ought to know
what is at stake in accepting or rejecting the argument and the
assumptions it requires.</p>

<h2>Method in Psychology</h2>

<p>

These reflections on method in psychology bring into focus
Aristotle&rsquo;s decision to describe psychic phenomena in terms of
his broader explanatory framework: he articulates his account of the
soul and its faculties as special cases of his general hylomorphism.
That is fair enough as far is it goes, because, as we see in the coming
sections, Aristotle most definitely does articulate his positive
account of the soul in hylomorphic terms, beginning in the second book
of <em>De Anima</em>. To some extent, however, this approach runs the
risk of skewing our understanding of Aristotle&rsquo;s positive
doctrine. This is because it tends to discount another, complementary
approach to Aristotle&rsquo;s psychology, namely the approach he
himself adopts in the first book of <em>De Anima</em>. In <em>De
Anima</em> i Aristotle engages his aporetic and endoxic methods, that
is, his characteristic methods of approaching a complex issue by laying
out the problems (the <em>aporiai</em>) he sees as requiring attention
and then surveying the theories already advanced by his predecessors
(the reputable opinions, or <em>endoxa</em>.) (For more on
Aristotle&rsquo;s method, see  &sect;3 of the main entry  on
<a href="../aristotle/index.html">Aristotle</a>). The
comparatively neglected first book of <em>De Anima</em> provides a
textbook approach of these methods, including especially the endoxic
method. The vast majority of it is given over to a critical recounting
of the views advanced by Aristotle&rsquo;s predecessors, many but not
all of whom he regards as worthy of investigation in so far as they
teach something of value about the soul and its capacities.</p>

<p>

When we read <em>De Anima</em> i carefully, two things become clear.
First, Aristotle has a specific agenda in psychology, set forth in a
series of questions which condition the direction and character of his
investigations. Second, his critical remarks reveal what he thinks is
lacking in the approaches to the soul adopted by his predecessors, and
so also, by implication, what he takes himself to have accomplished by
the time he has completed his own preferred account. Reflecting on
<em>De Anima</em> i thus permits us to understand Aristotle&rsquo;s
positive doctrine by taking into consideration the ways in which
Aristotle himself frames his study&mdash;its problems, its central
lines of inquiry, and his expectations about what must be accomplished
in a successful psychological theory.</p>

<p>

Taking up the first point, reflection on the questions Aristotle takes
as salient for his inquiry into the soul reveals how he directs and
delimits the scope of his inquiry. That is, his selection of questions
does more than reflect his local preoccupations. Rather, it reveals
what he thinks an adequate account must accomplish. In this respect,
Aristotle&rsquo;s situation with the soul is rather like, for instance,
the situation we face today in framing any inquiry into the nature of
consciousness. The questions we ask both set our agenda and reveal our
implicit success conditions. One researcher might take her task to be
the determination of the frequency of synchronic neural oscillation
patterns in conscious activity. Having determined that conscious
activity correlates strongly with neural oscillation frequencies in the
40 Hz range, she will have met with success in her own terms. Another
researcher, by contrast, might take as his dominant task an explication
of how the first-person qualitative feel of a subject&rsquo;s mental
states can be accommodated within a fully physicalist account of the
mind. Success here would not consist in, for instance, charting
correlations in oscillation frequencies. Different questions yield
different research programs and so also different success
conditions.</p>
<p>

Aristotle opens <em>De Anima</em> by setting forth in exceptionally
clear terms the questions of concern to him in psychological
theory:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is presumably first of all necessary to determine the genus of
the soul and what it is. I mean whether it is some this&mdash;that is,
a substance&mdash;or a quality, or a quantity, or something in some one
of the other delineated categories. Further, it is necessary to
determine whether it is one of the things which exist in potentiality
or whether it is, rather, an actuality. For this makes no small
difference. One must also consider whether it has parts or is without
parts, and whether or not all souls are uniform in kind, or if not
whether they differ in species or in genus. For as things are, those
discussing and inquiring into the soul would seem to consider only the
human soul.</p>

<p>

And one must take care not to overlook the question of whether there
is one account of soul, as there is one account of animal, or whether
there is a different account for each type of soul, for example, of
horse, of dog, of man, of god, while the universal animal is either
nothing or is posterior to these; and it would be the same if any other
common thing were being predicated.</p>

<p>

Further, if there are not many souls but rather the soul has parts,
one must determine whether it is necessary to inquire first into the
soul as a whole or into its parts. It is also difficult to determine
which of the parts differ by nature from one another, as well as
whether one ought to inquire into the parts or their functions first,
for example, whether one ought to inquire first into reasoning or
reason, or into perceiving or the perceptive faculty, and so on for the
other parts. And if one ought to inquire first into their functions,
someone might raise a puzzle (<em>aporia</em>) as to whether one must
inquire into their corresponding objects before these, for example,
into the objects of perception before the faculty of perception, and
the objects of reason before reason (<em>DA</em> i, 402a23-b16).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

One can appreciate Aristotle&rsquo;s forthrightness in laying out
his agenda so clearly, even while asking from a certain remove whether
his questions are the right ones to be posing about the soul.</p>

<p>

In sum, his questions are these:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>To what category of being does the soul belong? Is it, for
instance, a substance, a basic being, or is it rather a quality
belonging to a substance or a quantity of some sort? We may note that,
as posed, Aristotle&rsquo;s first question presupposes that souls do
in fact exist. In this respect, his question may be contrasted with
the similarly categorial questions he poses elsewhere, as, for
instance, about time in <em>Physics</em> iv 10&ndash;14, where finding
a categorial home for time also serves to reaffirm its existence (he
thinks time is a measure of motion, and so in the category of
quantity). In the Physics, then, Aristotle takes it as an open
question as to whether time exists at all; by contrast, in <em>De
Anima</em>, be takes it for granted that the soul exists and wants to
know only what kind of thing it is.</p></li>

<li><p>What is the soul&rsquo;s modality of being? Does it exist in
potentiality or in actuality? Such a question opens up the possibility
that the soul might be a mere capacity of a body, like, for instance,
someone&rsquo;s ability to swim: a person able to swim is actually
swimming only sometimes, but once she has learnt to swim she has the
capacity to swim all the while, even when it is unexercised. Is the
soul relevantly like the ability to swim, a capacity belonging to
something else which becomes manifest only when exercised?</p></li>

<li><p>Does the soul have parts?  At first glance, this seems to be a
question about psychic mereology, asking, for instance, whether the
soul is tri-partite, as Plato had maintained in <em>Republic</em>
iv. It does indeed have this focus, but upon closer inspection one
sees that Aristotle is equally interested in some further issues as
well. Is there is a single genus of soul to which all souls belong? Or
should we think that different kinds of beings&mdash;dogs, humans,
gods&mdash;have different kinds of souls, which might be related as
species falling under the same genus but, then again, might not? One
way to understand the way in which his concern about mereology merges
into a question about the possibility of there being a single genus of
soul turns on the fact that different kinds of souls have different
kinds of faculties, or, broadly speaking, different kinds of
parts. According to Aristotle, both non-human animals and humans have
the capacity to perceive but only humans have reason. The fact that
animals have one of these capacities (perception) without the other
(reason) might reinforce the idea that perception and reason are parts
of the human soul, but that then raises the question of whether these
two souls&mdash;the one with reason and perception and the one with
perception alone&mdash;might not be two species of the same genus. On
the one hand, one sort of soul seems in some sense to contain the
other, which is not the normal situation with two species of a single
genus. On the other hand, one might wonder whether there is one kind
of soul, the perceptual soul, which is distinct in kind from the
other, the rational soul, such that they are two species of the same
genus, differentiated precisely by the presence of reason in one of
them. In this way, questions of mereology link up with taxonomical
questions that need to be pursued.</p></li>

<li><p>Back on the more narrowly mereological side of the question,
assuming that individual souls do have parts, one will need to
determine whether these parts differ from one another by
nature&mdash;for instance, whether perception and imagination are
discrete faculties&mdash;or are rather &lsquo;parts&rsquo;
differentiated only as a kind of explanatory convenience, as when a
school teacher divides her pupils into &lsquo;the eager and the
reluctant&rsquo;. She may well be tracking something, but it seems
hard to credit the suggestion that this sort of division corresponds
to a division in nature.</p></li>

<li><p>Also wrapped up in this question, as Aristotle makes clear, is
the issue of whether the soul admits of a univocal definition, that
is, a single, non-disjunctive essence-specifying account,
like <em>animal</em>, or whether &lsquo;&hellip; has a soul&rsquo; is
rather like &lsquo;&hellip;is good&rsquo; when predicated of an opera
singer, some ice-cream, and a proposal to reform the economy. Perhaps,
in this case, as we should not be seeking a single account of
goodness, we should not be seeking a single account of soul. (For more
on univocity, see &sect;5 of the main entry on
 <a href="../aristotle/index.html">Aristotle</a>.)</p></li>

<li><p>Further on the question
of mereology, and still assuming that the soul does have parts, should
one first characterize the whole soul and then its parts? Or should one
begin with the parts first and then build an account of soul more
generally on that basis?</p></li>

<li><p>Still further along in
the same vein, if one should in fact look to the parts before looking
to the whole, should one begin with the parts themselves or should one
rather examine their activities at the outset? That is, assuming the
soul has a part call &lsquo;reason&rsquo; (or mind, or intellect,
<em>nous</em>), is the right order of business first to discuss
reasoning and thereafter the faculty of reason, or should one think
first about the nature of reason as a faculty before moving on to an
examination of its characteristic activities?</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, assuming that one should focus first on the activities
of the soul&rsquo;s parts, should one direct one&rsquo;s attention in
the first instance to the objects over which those activities range?
That is, should one think first about the differences between, say,
the objects of reason and the objects of perception, before moving on
to characterize reasoning and perceiving?</p></li>

<li><p>The final question leads in a characteristic fashion to a
puzzle (an <em>aporia</em>): if it is the case that faculties are
individuated by their objects&mdash;we say that vision is that faculty
which detects color, while smelling is that faculty which detects
scent&mdash;how do we go about identifying these objects without
having first identified the capacities with which they are associated?
Is scent anything other than an object of smell? If not, then we must
already have some notion about how the faculty of smell operates, so
that we can individuate scents from other sensible qualities. After
all, among the sensible qualities of a rose, damask is a scent and
redness is not; only one of these is thus a candidate for detection by
the sense of smell.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>

This puzzle then gives way to a series of additional puzzles, which
corporately make any inquiry into the soul especially daunting. In view
of these methodological hurdles, one can appreciate why Aristotle
registers a genuine conundrum: &lsquo;even if the method [of
investigating the soul] should be evident, whether it is demonstration
or division or even some other method, the question of where one ought
to begin our inquiry already involves many difficulties and quandaries
(<em>DA</em> i, 402a19&ndash;22).</p>

<p>

Aristotle&rsquo;s characteristic way forward when confronting such
puzzles and impediments, whether substantive or methodological, is to
engage in his endoxic method. This he does very clearly in <em>De
Anima</em> i&mdash;which brings us to our second reason for reflecting
first on that book before turning to the more often discussed material
of the following two books, where we encounter Aristotle&rsquo;s
positive theory of the soul and its capacities. If it seems anodyne to
recommend that we read the first book before the second, it is perhaps
worth remembering that even otherwise excellent translations sometimes
omit some or all of <em>De Anima</em> i, as being merely doxographical.
Still, when we do read it, we discover in that doxography
Aristotle&rsquo;s investigations into a broad spectrum of views,
beginning with those of Thales and ranging right up to Plato, whose
account of reason (<em>nous</em>) in the <em>Timaeus</em> commands his
special interest. He initially endorses two principal commitments which
he represents his predecessors as being virtually unanimous in
accepting:</p>

<blockquote>
What is ensouled seems to differ from what is not ensouled chiefly
in two respects: motion and perception. These are also very nearly the
two features of the soul which we have taken over from our predecessors
(<em>DA</em> i 2, 403b25&ndash;27).</blockquote>

<p>

So much seems more or less unexciting, until it emerges that
Aristotle argues repeatedly that his predecessors had made a common
mistake when thinking about motion, namely that only what is already in
motion can initiate motion. This mistake, he implies, inclines them to
think of the soul in crudely materialistic terms, since they are
looking to explain motion by positing something which is itself in
motion, which we would expect to be some manner of material body. So,
for instance, he chastises the atomist Democritus for making this sort
of error:</p>

<blockquote>
Some say that as the soul is in motion; it moves the body in which
it is, e.g. Democritus, speaking in a manner much like the comic
playwright Philippus. For Philippus claims that Daedalus made his
wooden Aphrodite move by pouring liquid silver into it. What Democritus
says is similar. He claims that since the indivisible spheres are in
motion, because it is their nature never to remain still, they draw the
whole body along with them and set it in motion (<em>DA</em> i 3,
406b15&ndash;21).</blockquote>

<p>

Notably, in rejecting the claim that the soul must be in motion to
initiate motion, Aristotle incurs a large debt. He must now explain how
the soul can manage to initiate motion without being itself in motion.
In the course of <em>De Anima</em> i he offers only the observation
that &lsquo;the soul does not appear to initiate motion in animals in
this way, but rather through some sort of decision and reasoning&rsquo;
(<em>DA</em> i 3, 406b24&ndash;25). This is fair enough where the first book
is concerned, since it is primarily aporetic and endoxic. Still,
a question arises as to how&mdash;and how well&mdash;Aristotle means to
account for the soul&rsquo;s ability to cause motion. Needless to
say, this account must supersede the criticisms he lays at the
doorsteps of his various predecessors.</p>

<p>

Of special note in this connection is Aristotle&rsquo;s reaction to the
doctrine that the soul is an attunement (or harmony,
<em>harmonia</em>), which he takes up in detail in <em>De Anima</em> i
4. As Aristotle notes, this is a view that had already occasioned
a good deal of discussion (<em>DA</em> i 4, 407b27&ndash;29), and we find one
such discussion presented in Plato&rsquo;s <em>Phaedo</em>. 
Although the doctrine of attunement admits of various formulations, its
basic contours are clear enough: in its terms, the soul is to be
identified with neither the material components of the body, as the
Presocratic materialists had thought, nor as an incorporeal entity
capable of existing without the body, as Plato had urged in the
<em>Phaedo</em>. Instead, it is something in-between: as the attunement
of a viola is neither the parts of the viola nor even the viola taken
as a whole but rather a condition of the viola, so the soul is neither
the material elements making up the body nor the body taken as a whole
but rather a condition or structure of the body. In neither case should
we suppose that being non-identical with the body or its parts suffices
for a something to exist apart from the body. As the attunement of a
viola ends when the viola goes out of existence, so too does the soul
cease when the body ceases. The soul, suggests Aristotle, exists when
and only when the body whose soul it is exists.</p>

<p>

Given his aim of finding a middle way between the reductive tendencies
of the Presocratic materialists and Platonic dualism, the attunement
theory ought to appear attractive to Aristotle. Indeed, as was noticed
already in antiquity, it bears a striking resemblance to his own
preferred hylomorphism. The Aristotelian commentator Themistius
(317&ndash;390 C.E.) fairly observes in this connection: &lsquo;It is
clear&hellip;that those calling the soul an attunement would seem to
land neither excessively near nor very far off from the truth&rsquo;
(<em>in DA</em> 25, 23&ndash;24). Especially apposite here is the contention
that proponents of the attunement do not land &lsquo;excessively
near&hellip;the truth&rsquo;, which truth is, presumably, encapsulated
in Aristotle&rsquo;s hylomorphism. The question thus arises: how does
it fall short of hylomorphism? Looked at from the opposite direction,
why is Aristotle&rsquo;s preferred hylomorphism itself not just a
notational variant of the attunement theory made to seem distinct only
by being articulated in Aristotle&rsquo;s preferred technical
terminology? Here too Aristotle incurs a debt which must be repaid when
advancing his preferred account of soul. How, precisely, does
Aristotle&rsquo;s hylomorphism improve upon&mdash;if indeed it does
improve upon&mdash;the attunement theory of soul?</p>

<p>

Aristotle does have answers to these questions, but they are not always
on the surface of his positive account. We see, then, that to
understand how he conceives of the soul and its relation to the body,
we should attend closely to Aristotle&rsquo;s criticisms of his
predecessors. These tell us both what in his view a successful theory
of soul must accomplish and also what pitfalls it must avoid.</p>

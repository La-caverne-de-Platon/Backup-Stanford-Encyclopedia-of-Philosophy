<h2>Hare&rsquo;s &ldquo;An Essay in Monism&rdquo;</h2>

<p>

While on leave in 1940, Hare wrote twenty pages setting out &ldquo;my
philosophy&rdquo;. When Singapore fell, he looted a ledger from Changi
jail, and started writing a monograph called &ldquo;An Essay in
Monism&rdquo;. He carried this on his back during the march, and
completed it just before being released. He typed it out, making
multiple copies, once he was free. He later dismissed it as
&ldquo;containing mostly rubbish&rdquo; (Seanor &amp; Fotion 1988:
201); even its Preface says it is &ldquo;based, I know, on
insufficient reading imperfectly remembered&rdquo;. There are
detectable influences from Alfred North Whitehead, Arthur Eddington,
and&mdash;indirectly&mdash;Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s neutral monism); yet it
is already characteristic in its clarity, consistency, lucidity, and
self-confidence. It remains very little known (but see John E. Hare
2007: 200&ndash;7), and is of interest both in itself, and for points
of connection with his mature thinking. As it is only accessible
within the archives of Balliol College, Oxford: it may be apt to
supply a density of quotation.</p>

<p>

A central notion, initially put to work in relating mind and matter
without dualism, is <em>rhythm</em>, which is an activity that unites
a thing with its causes and effects. The metaphysics that emerges is
one of process rather than substance. The identity of a
&ldquo;rhythm&rdquo; extends into its effects: </p>

<blockquote><p>A rhythm is a series of occurrences which includes
every effect caused by that rhythm; that is to say, a thing&rsquo;s effects,
or the energy which it gives off, are just as much a part of that
thing&rsquo;s entity as what we erroneously call its
&ldquo;matter&rdquo;. (ch. 4, p. 28)</p></blockquote>

<p>As Hare recognizes, &ldquo;This is nonsense if we are thinking of a
&lsquo;thing&rsquo; as &lsquo;a piece of matter&rsquo;&rdquo; (ch. 4,
p. 30); but this changes if a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; is analyzable as a
series of occurrences, for there is then &ldquo;nothing to prevent the
same occurrence being part of several different series&rdquo; (ch. 4,
p. 31). The reality (as on certain contemporary views of personal
identity) is that a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; possesses not a definite
boundary, but an indefinite periphery:</p>

<blockquote><p> Within one rhythm certain occurrences are more remote
(or more immediate) causes (or effects) than others. That is to say,
the coherence is stronger and more obvious at the <em>centre</em> than
on the fringe. The more remote causes of a rhythm count for less in
the entity of that rhythm than the more immediate causes, and the same
is true of effects. That is why in our everyday consideration of
rhythms we are content to ignore its fringes and to grasp at the
central part. (ch. 4, p. 33)</p></blockquote>

<p>Descartes&rsquo; inference from the experience of thinking to the
existence of a thing that thinks is rejected as importing an unreal
stasis:</p>

<blockquote><p>The fact is the cognition, not the thing cognised
&hellip; The &ldquo;facts&rdquo; of the world are not substantial
objects, but events or occurrences. In the grammar of
existence, <em>verbs</em> are the vital words, not subjects or
objects. (ch.  9, p. 82) </p></blockquote>

<p>

It is an upshot that &ldquo;things&rdquo; extend into one another in a
way that might be represented by overlapping sets of concentric
circles:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
If two rhythms exist side by side in the same universe,
rhythm <i>A</i> will in a certain degree be affected by
rhythm <i>B</i>, and will in a certain degree affect rhythm <i>B</i>
&hellip; <i>A</i>&rsquo;s sphere of influence extends within the boundaries
of <i>B</i>, and the influence is not uniform, but decreases as it
gets further from its source. To describe this concept we may borrow a
term of Whitehead&rsquo;s, &ldquo;prehension&rdquo;: <i>B</i>&rsquo;s sphere of
influence within the limits of <i>A</i> is called <i>A</i>&rsquo;s
&ldquo;prehension&rdquo; of <i>B</i>, and <em>vice versa</em> (ch.  7,
p. 53).</p></blockquote>

<p>

This may either enhance <i>A</i>&rsquo;s individuality or constrict it,
depending on the manner in which <i>A</i> acts upon <i>B</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When two rhythms prehend one another, their relations
can be either friendly or antagonistic. If <i>A</i>
influences <i>B</i> in such a way as to fit in with <i>B</i>&rsquo;s rhythm,
the two rhythms may be said to be in sympathy. In this case the two
rhythms are united in a combined rhythm without losing their rhythmic
individuality. (ch. 7, p. 54)</p></blockquote>

<p>

One corollary of this is the adoption of an externalist view of
perception:</p>

<blockquote><p> To isolate the body as something separate from our
environment, is to regard perception as beginning suddenly when our
bodies take part in it. But, as we have seen, cognition is a process
extending right from the object to ourselves; and whatever in this
process is consciously cognised by us, is cognition &hellip; Our
cognition extends outside our bodies into our environment; or we may
say that our bodies are merely a part of our environment; or better,
that both bodies and environment are rightfully parts of our
rhythms. (ch. 10, pp. 91&ndash;2)</p></blockquote>

<p>

Into this context Hare introduces talk of &ldquo;value&rdquo; which is
not easy to interpret, especially in light of his later views. He
distinguishes value from substance as he has distinguished substance
from rhythm, but how rhythm and value relate is less clear:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> The &ldquo;factor&rdquo; which determines a rhythm
from another rhythm is not a factor of substance but a factor of
value. A rhythm is an interpretation of the universe according to its
own standard of value; that is to say, it regards the events of the
universe <em>quoad</em> itself, and as turning towards or cohering to
itself, while turning away or being distinct from other rhythms
&hellip; The same occurrence may have greater value from the point of
view of one rhythm, less value from the point of view of
another. (ch. 4, p. 33)</p></blockquote>

<p> This connects with the use of the word &ldquo;I&rdquo;, which
should not be interpreted as referring to a substance:</p>

<blockquote><p> I am not setting up an &ldquo;Ego&rdquo; which is
something distinct from the cognition, something which would exist,
even if the cognition did not take place. Things are their actions;
the action is the thing.  Therefore the cognition is part of me, and I
do not exist apart from my experiences. By saying that this cognition
has reference to something called &ldquo;I&rdquo;, I mean that this
event called a cognition <em>coheres</em> in a certain direction; it
has a certain value &hellip; &ldquo;Cognovi&rdquo; implies, not a
subject and a verb, but an event cohering in a certain direction,
possessing a certain value.  &ldquo;I&rdquo; am that direction and
that value. I do not exist apart from my cognitions, any more than any
Rhythm exists apart from its constituent events (ch. 9,
p. 83).</p></blockquote>

<p>

John Hare suggests (2007: 203 n.) that this anticipates Hare&rsquo;s much
later proposal (on which see &sect; 4 above) that there is a
prescriptive aspect to the meaning of &ldquo;I&rdquo;. It may be
consistent with this that the perspective within which a rhythm
identifies itself is also, and <em>ipso facto</em>, one within which
there appear unequal values whose degree depends upon the centrality
or marginality of some cognition to the process of which it is a part.
Hare can never have meant to imply a freedom whereby a man might
relegate an event to the margins of his life, or even expel it beyond
its borders, by adopting towards it a voluntary attitude of
detachment.</p>

<p>

We meet anticipations of the later dichotomy between fact and value,
cognition and volition, that links Hare to David Hume. Goodness is
internally related to persons: &ldquo;Goodness is Rhythm <em>willed
from within</em> by a Person&rdquo;; beauty is
&ldquo;Rhythm <em>viewed from without</em> by a Person through the
exercise of sympathy&rdquo; (ch. 17, p. 38). Hare already adopts the
dichotomy, fundamental to his later philosophy, between cognition and
will:</p>

<blockquote><p>We say that a man cognises something when he is
consciously affected by it; we say that he wills something when he
consciously causes it &hellip; Cognition is the passive, will the
active function of personality. (ch. 8, pp.
63&ndash;4)</p></blockquote>

<p>A person, therefore, is &ldquo;the passage of a coherent system of
cognition into a coherent system of will&rdquo; (ch. 8, p.
72). However, he also recognizes that will presupposes cognition:</p>

<blockquote><p>Will is so absolutely dependent on foreknowledge, that
it is hard to imagine any effective act of will without some knowledge
of the future. Consider for example the act of stretching out a hand;
we could not will this, unless we were conscious that our hand would
obey the behest of our will &hellip; Foreknowledge therefore, although
logically distinct from will, is always a constituent of any act of
will. (ch. 15, pp. 22&ndash;3)</p></blockquote>

<p>This anticipates Hare&rsquo;s later insistence that a decision between
alternative acts is <em>ipso facto</em> one between different sets of
consequences:</p>

<blockquote><p> It is the effects which determine what I should be
doing; it is between the two sets of effects that I am deciding. The
whole point about a decision is that it makes a difference to what
happens; and this difference is the difference between the effects of
deciding one way, and the effects of deciding the other. (1952:
56&ndash;7).</p></blockquote>

<p>

Hare has applied Whitehead&rsquo;s term &ldquo;prehension&rdquo; to the
overflowing of one man&rsquo;s activity into the life of another.  He also
envisages an exercise of love and sympathy that gives him entry into
another life:</p>

<blockquote><p>The meaning of love is that two persons &ldquo;get
inside&rdquo; one another, so that the feelings of each become the
feelings of both. By Love we see through another&rsquo;s eyes, hear through
his ears, run with his feet, handle with his hands; and he does the
same with ours &hellip; Thus it is through Love that the greatest and
fullest extension of our person can be achieved, namely extension into
the person of another. (ch. 20, p. 70)</p></blockquote>

<p>Much later (see his 1978, reprinted with second thoughts in 1989a),
it was to become a question for Hare whether fully entering into the
mind of another is sufficient to necessitate wishing <em>for him</em>
what he wishes for himself, or only for forming wishes for what should
happen <em>to oneself</em> were one in his shoes.</p>

<p>

Very much later he was to regret his inability to convey more than
&ldquo;feebly and aridly&rdquo; supplementary reflections such as
these:</p>

<blockquote><p>The quality of mutual love and affection between
people, without which our life would have few joys, cannot be had
without the right dispositions; and these dispositions, therefore, are
the condition of both happiness and morality. (1981:
vii)</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, within a chapter on &ldquo;sin&rdquo;, he is happy to follow
Plato:</p>

<blockquote><p>Successful tyrants&mdash;that is, those who use other
people solely as means to their own selfish ends&mdash;have been few
in history, and it is open to question whether any of them have been
happy. For no man can be truly happy by himself; most human happiness
is a function of our association with other men &hellip; Such
association is barred to the man who has made other men hate him. The
person of a tyrant is inevitably stunted. (ch. 18,
p. 52)</p></blockquote>

<h2>Response-Dependence</h2>

<p>
Already early sentimentalists compared moral properties to other
mind-dependent properties. Locke had distinguished between <em>primary
qualities</em>, properties that can be conceived of independently of
our responses to them, and <em>secondary qualities</em>, which was his
term for &ldquo;powers to produce various sensations in us&rdquo;
(Locke 1694 [1975]: 2.8.10). Hutcheson pointed to this distinction in
somewhat misleading terms by saying that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we must remember that of the sensible ideas, some are allowed to be
only perceptions in our minds, and not images of any like external
quality, as colours, sounds, tastes, smells, pleasure, pain.
(Hutcheson 1728: 177) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He claimed that moral approbation belonged to the same category as the
latter. Hume picked up the point in almost exactly the same language,
saying that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Vice and virtue &hellip; may be compared to sounds, colours, heat and
cold, which, according to modern philosophy, are not qualities in
objects, but perceptions in the mind. (T 469)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These early sentimentalist accounts are somewhat confusing, and can
also be read as a kind of projectivism: virtue and colour are not
qualities of actions or objects, but only exist in the
perceiver&rsquo;s mind. But that wasn&rsquo;t Locke&rsquo;s view:
secondary qualities <em>are</em> properties of objects, albeit powers
of producing responses in perceivers. Hume did, occasionally, use this
kind of language, too, saying that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
these two particulars are to be consider&rsquo;d as equivalent
&hellip; <em>virtue</em> or the power of producing love or pride,
<em>vice</em> and the power of producing humility and hatred. (T
575)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such properties are neither brutely out there nor only in our minds,
but arise in the interaction between the subject and the object.
Whether they are &lsquo;real&rsquo; is not a particularly interesting
question &ndash; on some disambiguations, the answer is yes, on others
no. (For sophisticated efforts, see Pettit 1991 and Wright 1992; see
also the entry on
 <a href="../moral-anti-realism/index.html">moral anti-realism</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
It has become common to express the kind of mind-dependence at issue
in terms of <em>response-dependence</em>. Here is a basic schema for
such accounts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Necessarily/<em>a priori</em>, an action <i>x</i> is <i>M</i> if and
only if subject <i>S</i> would have response <i>R</i> to <i>x</i> in
circumstances <i>C</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is an immense variety of actual and possible theories fitting
this schema, given that the subject, response, and circumstance
variables can be filled in in many different ways. Most are patently
absurd (consider &ldquo;necessarily, an action is wrong if and only if
J. Edgar Hoover would snicker at it first thing in the
morning&rdquo;). The variants that will be considered below involve
substituting for <i>S</i> subjects as they are, non-normatively
idealized subjects, and virtuous or good subjects, respectively.</p>

<p>
Suitable circumstances <i>C</i> will depend on what kind of subject is
at issue. The important feature in response-dependence accounts is
that the circumstances are not specified in terms of whatever it takes
to get it right. After all, take a mind-independent property such as
being circular. It is a priori true that a shape is circular if and
only if we would believe it is circular, were we perfect circularity
trackers observing it in perfect circularity-tracking conditions. If
we meet the conditions on the right-hand side, there is no conceptual
room for error: we are guaranteed to get it right. But in the case of
a mind-independent property, this is only because we define the
subject and conditions in terms that presuppose there are
mind-independent truths about shapes (the right-hand side refers to
<em>tracking</em> circularity).</p>

<p>
When the property is genuinely response-dependent, such as being
disgusting, a corresponding claim is a priori or necessarily true
without a whatever-it-takes specification. If the link between
responses and properties is a priori knowable, then the equation
expresses some kind of conceptual or analytical truth. David Lewis,
for example, says that his version of the response-dependence equation
is <em>equivocally analytical</em> &ndash; analytically true under
some precisifications of the relevant ordinary concepts (Lewis 1989:
130). But some take the equation to be a posteriori necessary truth,
and are thus not committed to a claim about our ordinary concepts.</p>

<p>
The responses <i>R</i> may be thought of as the same sort of moral
sentiments or valuing attitudes that non-cognitivists appeal to. One
challenge is that it appears that the same action may cause or merit
many different responses, depending on the context, so specific
emotions and properties are not paired (Koons 2003: 280). A basic
rejoinder is to say that blame or disapprobation, for example, is
constituted by a spectrum of responses that do indeed vary from
context to context. According to Jesse Prinz, which emotion
constitutes blame depends on who is blamed and for what (2006: 34).
For example, violations of a perceived natural order arouse disgust
when committed by others, and shame when committed by oneself.</p>

<p>
It is also possible to substitute <em>judgment</em> or belief in the
response slot. Indeed, Crispin Wright argues that it is preferable to
do so, given that the relevant experiences will be conceptually
informed, such that someone who lacks the concept of being funny will
not be capable of amusement, for example (Wright 1988: 13). This is
controversial, and would rule out certain reductive explanatory
projects. Lewis points out that if valuing were just believing, there
would be &ldquo;no conceptual reason why valuing is a
<em>favourable</em> attitude&rdquo; (Lewis 1989: 115).</p>

<p>
There are a number of general motivations for accepting a
response-dependence (RD) account of some sort. In contrast to
<em>non-naturalism</em>, RD accounts aspire to be
<em>naturalistic</em>. They do not assume that moral facts are <em>sui
generis</em> or knowable by some kind of non-empirical intuition. They
also do not assume that moral facts are brute: there is a kind of
explanation for why some moral standards are correct (they would be
endorsed from the relevant perspective). Some response-dependence
views are <em>reductive</em>: moral facts are identified with natural
facts of a certain kind, such as dispositional facts. Others are
<em>non-reductive</em>: normative terms appear on both sides of the
equation, so it only elucidates relations among different kinds of
normative concepts or properties (Wiggins 1987). (Whether this
suffices for naturalism is debatable.)</p>

<p>
In contrast to <em>mind-independent naturalism</em>, RD accounts deny
that moral properties can be identified with response-independent
natural properties. One reason to do so is the alleged
<em>heterogeneity</em> or <em>natural shapelessness</em> of moral and
evaluative properties. (This is related to McDowell&rsquo;s (1979)
point about the uncodifiability of ethics.) As Prinz puts the
challenge,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Immoral acts comprise a hodgepodge: lying, stealing, hoarding,
hurting, killing, neglecting, harassing, polluting, insulting,
molesting, vandalizing, disrespecting, and so forth. What do these
things have in common other than the fact that we frown on all of
them? (Prinz 2007: 48; cf. Wiggins 1987: 193) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Put modestly, the argument is that mind-independent naturalists must
pay the cost of subscribing to wildly disjunctive properties.</p>

<p>
Further, even if there is a non-disjunctive pattern to be found at the
natural level, RD accounts distinguish between the property of
<em>being right</em> (the response-dependent property) and a
<em>right-making</em> property (a response-independent property).
Maximizing utility may be what makes an action right, but it is
distinct from rightness itself. One indication of this is that if our
moral concepts were concepts of natural properties, disagreements
about their application would necessarily involve conceptual error on
someone&rsquo;s part. But it seems that a utilitarian and a Kantian
may both be conceptually competent while disagreeing about what is
wrong. The concepts are <em>essentially contestable</em>: the focus of
moral disagreement is whether the action in question causes or merits
the pertinent response, not what response-independent properties it
has (Wiggins 1987: 198).</p>

<p>
Finally, response-dependence accounts bear some resemblance to
<em>constructivist</em> views of moral truth. Constructivists, too,
believe that moral and perhaps other normative facts depend on certain
responses of ours under certain conditions. But for them, such facts
depend on the responses of <em>rational</em> agents or those who
follow norms of <em>practical reasoning</em> in suitable conditions
(for a general account, see James 2007). Roughly, something is wrong,
for example, if and only if (and because) anyone would agree to a norm
prohibiting it in virtue of being reasonable or rational. Since the
real work in determining the relevant facts is done by the putative
norms of practical reason rather than our emotional or conative
responses, constructivist theories form an importantly different
category. Sentimentalists reject these views because of content
scepticism about practical reason (see
 <a href="supplement1.html">Anti-Rationalism Supplement</a>).</p>

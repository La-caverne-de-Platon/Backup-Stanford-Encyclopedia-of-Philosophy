<h2>Consciousness of Self</h2>

<p>
How should we bring together questions about the relation of
consciousness to &ldquo;state self-consciousness&rdquo; with questions
about its relation to consciousness of <em>oneself</em>&mdash;its
connection with &ldquo;subject self-consciousness&rdquo;? We can see
these topics are distinct, by noting how someone might hold that
conscious states are states one is conscious of, while denying this
involves any consciousness of the <em>subject</em> who has them.
Consider David Armstrong&rsquo;s (1968) theory of consciousness. This
holds that the higher-order perception of a state that constitutes
both its <em>being conscious</em> and its being <em>introspected</em>,
is a bare perception of the state&mdash;which does not assign that
state to anyone (or to any mind). To say that the state is
<em>someone&rsquo;s in particular</em> would be to go beyond
what is strictly found in inner perception.</p>

<p>
Armstrong&rsquo;s position recalls David Hume&rsquo;s famous remarks,
testifying to his failure to observe anything but
&ldquo;perceptions&rdquo; when, as he says, &ldquo;I enter into what I
call my self&rdquo;. These remarks have often been cited as expressing
insights about the &ldquo;elusiveness of self&rdquo; that we should
honor in our accounts of self-consciousness. Robert Howell (2006), for
example, speaks of the need to respect the &ldquo;phenomenological
data adduced by Hume&rdquo;, in arguing for his descriptivist account
of &ldquo;basic self reference&rdquo;. On Howell&rsquo;s proposal, I
understand to whom I refer in saying &ldquo;I&rdquo;, via an
acquaintance not with <em>the referent</em> (Hume&rsquo;s
phenomenology correctly denies there is any such
acquaintance)&mdash;but with <em>an experience</em>, an awareness of
which is naturally expressible in demonstrative terms: &ldquo;this
sensation&rdquo;. My basic self-reference&mdash;my understanding of
who <em>I</em> am&mdash;is grasped only by a description: <em>the
person who has this sensation.</em> Whether one tries in some such way
to reduce subject self-consciousness to state self-consciousness or
not, one may wish to separate what one is conscious of, in being
conscious of the state, from the subject or self to whom it is
attributed&mdash;consciousness of the <em>subject</em> being arrived
at, if at all, only by a distinct operation. In Armstrong&rsquo;s
account this extra operation is an implicit bit of theorizing,
positing a mind to which the introspected states belong. In
Howell&rsquo;s account it comes from forming a demonstrative-embedding
description. And one may recall an analogous position expressed in
Sartre&rsquo;s ([1943] 1956) view: his pre-reflective
self-consciousness (alleged to be inseparable from consciousness
generally) is a consciousness merely of <em>consciousness</em>, not of
an &ldquo;ego&rdquo; whose consciousness it is&mdash;the ego being a
reflective construct born of anxiety in the face of radical
freedom.</p>

<p>
In response to such views, one may resist the Humean phenomenology. If
one doubts that there is anything like &ldquo;inner sense&rdquo;, one
might well think that, far from observing <em>only</em> perceptions,
one <em>never</em> observes them. On the other hand, one does at least
perceive <em>one&rsquo;s own body</em>: why is this not a perception
of self? As for introspection, if this consists in judgments about
one&rsquo;s own experiences, the phenomenological question will be
whether a non-descriptive self-reference is rightly excluded from its
content in favor of purely demonstrative, egoless reference to
experiences. An affirmative answer to <em>this</em> question may seem
dubious, and would appear to render puzzling why in such reflection I
cannot reasonably wonder <em>whose</em> sensation <em>this</em> is.
(Regarding this last point, see the discussion of Howell in Gertler
2011: 217&ndash;221.) However, a broadly Humean orientation might be
defended while conceding these points. For example, Prinz (2012)
remarks that while one may indeed have non-descriptive (or
&ldquo;non-attributive&rdquo;) I-thoughts, and while one of course
experiences one&rsquo;s own body, none of this amounts to an
experience of self &ldquo;as <em>subject</em>&rdquo;. And that is what
ultimately is at issue.</p>

<p>
Here we join with the third idea earlier identified in phenomenology
when discussing the &ldquo;reflexivity&rdquo; theme: the idea that
there is a consciousness of self &ldquo;as subject&rdquo; basic to
experience. The contrast between &ldquo;as object&rdquo; and &ldquo;as
subject&rdquo; consciousness of self that is found in phenomenology
stems from the Kantian tradition. Andrew Brook (2006), in a helpful
overview of Kant&rsquo;s views on self-consciousness, identifies this
notion as an enduring part of Kant&rsquo;s contribution: necessarily
connected with one&rsquo;s experience of objects is an awareness of
oneself as subject of those experiences, in a self-consciousness that
is distinct from and prior to any attribution of properties to oneself
(see also Longuenesse 2006). This Kantian legacy may be discerned in
some of the aspects of phenomenologists&rsquo; views earlier noted
that take up the idea that a consciousness of self as subject is
associated with agency and the &ldquo;spontaneity of the
understanding&rdquo;. Recall how, for Husserl, commitments necessarily
involved in experienced acts of thought imply a persisting thinker who
makes and can be held to them. For Heidegger, we are pre-reflectively
disclosed to ourselves through discovering things in everyday
practical dealings with them. For Merleau-Ponty, the body we
experience as our own in ordinary active perception is an
understand<em>er,</em> a subject&mdash;understanding in a manner
directly exhibited in movement. More recently, a view of the
&ldquo;experiential self&rdquo;, inspired by an interpretation of the
phenomenological tradition, has been elaborated by Dan Zahavi (2005,
2014)&mdash;who locates the most primitive experience of
self&mdash;and indeed the <em>self</em> primitively
experienced&mdash;not in active understanding, but in a basic
&ldquo;for-me-ness&rdquo; he holds is essential to consciousness, and
which he also identifies with the &ldquo;first-person givenness&rdquo;
of experience. Other related, recent proposed articulations of a
pared-down experience of self, include Galen Strawson&rsquo;s (2009)
notion of ephemeral, primitive &ldquo;selves&rdquo; in consciousness,
and Barry Dainton&rsquo;s (2008) notion of a &ldquo;phenomenal
self&rdquo; understood in terms of the continuity of the stream of
consciousness. An experienced (or experiential) self so conceived is
sometimes contrasted with a &ldquo;narrative self&rdquo; (one&rsquo;s
self conceived of as the protagonist in autobiographical
accounts)&mdash;especially where this notion figures in claims that
the self is nothing but a kind of fiction spun out of such
narrative&mdash;a &ldquo;center of narrative gravity&rdquo;, in
Dennett&rsquo;s (1991) metaphor. Arguments that a purely
&ldquo;narrativist&rdquo; conception of self is at least incomplete,
missing some important aspect of a basic experience of self, have also
focused on the idea that we have an experience of ourselves as agents
(Bayne and Pacherie 2007).</p>

<p>
The idea that there is a consciousness distinctive of agency that
amounts to a special and important form of consciousness of self has
been taken up, in recent decades, in trying to understand both how
basic self-reference is possible (the sort of issues we saw Howell
addressing), and what makes a particular person (or a self, or
whatever the personal pronoun takes as referent) one and the same over
time. With respect to the former topic, one encounters the challenge
(forcefully raised in Berm&uacute;dez 1998) of understanding what sort
of primitive self-consciousness precedes and enables the kind of
self-consciousness exhibited in mastery of the first-person pronoun.
Taking up this challenge, Lucy O&rsquo;Brien (2007) argues we need to
recognize a distinctive sort of &ldquo;agent awareness&rdquo;&mdash;a
non-attributive, non-conceptual (and non-perceptual) awareness of
self, that arises through the basic exercise of practical reason, in
considering and choosing possibilities for action &ldquo;as
possibilities&rdquo;. Such awareness enables you to be conscious of
yourself as an agent (without <em>representing</em> yourself to be an
agent), and thereby to know yourself as a <em>speaker</em>, so that,
when you then acquire and apply knowledge of the &ldquo;self-reference
rule&rdquo; (the rule that &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo; refers to the
speaker&rdquo;) you may non-attributively grasp self-reference in
language. With respect to concerns about the identity of persons over
time, Christine Korsgaard (1989) has argued in a Kantian vein that, as
rational beings engaged in even the most ordinary sorts of planning
and choice, we must be conscious of ourselves as having, and must
construct for ourselves, a unique path through time&mdash;by
&ldquo;identifying with a future&rdquo; in our choice of what to do.
What sort of unity over time is available to you will depend on
various contingent constraints, having to do with the sort of body you
happen to have, and current technological limitations. But your right
to regard yourself as having an identify over time, and as possessed
of an individual moral status that resists a utilitarian
&ldquo;leveling&rdquo; of moral concern&mdash;<em>this</em> is
adequately secured by the demands of practical reason, and needs no
vindication from viewing the practical, moral subject you are as a
<em>theoretical</em> object with certain persistence conditions.</p>

<p>
Another view, recently developed by Martine Nida-R&uuml;melin (2017)
neatly pulls together many of the issues raised here in a novel way.
She argues that no experience can be subjectless, and any that
exhibits what she calls &ldquo;basic intentionality&rdquo; will
necessarily involve something being presented <em>to a subject</em>
who, moreover, is <em>pre-reflectively aware of itself being presented
to</em>. In being such a subject you are not, however, necessarily
<em>presented</em> to yourself&mdash;you are not an intentional
<em>object</em> of your own awareness. But this pre-reflective
self-awareness <em>is</em> intentional insofar as it is assessable for
correctness. This self-awareness inseparable from intentional
consciousness is held to be important for several reasons. It
furnishes your core &ldquo;I-concept&rdquo;; it makes
<em>reflective</em> self-consciousness possible for you (even as it
enables you also to see <em>unreflecting</em> creatures as conscious
subjects); and it secures an understanding of what it is to be
numerically the same subject over time.</p>

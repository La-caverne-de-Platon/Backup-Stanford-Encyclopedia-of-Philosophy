<h2>Visual Education</h2>

<p>
After 1921, Neurath became secretary of the Cooperative Housing and
Allotment Association in Vienna, a public housing program. From an
administrative and political standpoint, he remained interested in
central management but shifted towards guild socialism&mdash;according
to which professional guilds, common in Vienna, acquired enhanced
social and political roles. Having directed the Museum of War Economy
of Leipzig in 1918, his educational and social ambitions led him to
found a similar institution in Vienna, and he became Director of the
Settlement Museum or Museum of City Planning (1919&ndash;1924), soon
renamed Social and Economic Museum (1924&ndash;1934), supporting and
communicating reform policies on housing, health and education. The
methods of visual education started out of these resources and his
exhibitions became internationally renowned and commissioned (Burke et
al. 2014). </p>

<p>
The application of simple colors and figures along with the use of
lino-cutting and printing methods were best for the production of
graphic symbols; but they were all alien to Vienna&rsquo;s recent
artistic movements. One of the earliest artists willing and able to
work in those formats was Erwin Bernath, a Swiss living in Vienna.
Neurath&rsquo;s displays at the GESOLEI exhibition (<em>Gro&szlig;e
Ausstellung f&uuml;r Gesundheit, soziale F&uuml;rsorge und
Leibes&uuml;bungen</em>) in D&uuml;sseldorf in 1926 provided the
occasion for Neurath&rsquo;s acquaintance with the Cologne artist Gerd
Arntz. Arntz had held similar revolutionary socialist views in Germany
after 1918. He published his expressive modernist clear-cut figures
combining the dramatic contrast and simplicity of the woodcut and
linocut techniques of German expressionism and the geometrical
clarity, order and simplicity of Russian Constructivism. Neurath hired
him in 1928 to begin the professional design of a visual language for
the public communication of historical and statistical information
(see Figures 1 and 2 below)
 (<a href="http://www.gerdarntz.org/isotype" target="other">Gerd Arntz Web Archive</a>).

<p>
The pictograms of the Vienna Method of Picture Statistics, later in
the internationalist phase, in exile, relabeled ISOTYPE (International
System Of TYpogra phic Picture Education) method, expressed the
modernist ideals of minimalism, functionalism, of design, with the
factuality, universality and neutrality, relative autonomy and
stability, of the visual with respect to interpretation and cultural
references. It had an abstracted, simplified, elemental and
Gestalt-like conventional quality intended to convey a concept through
the constructed representation of a typical individual&mdash;also
similar to Bauhaus &lsquo;essential types&rsquo;, a graphic product of
the same German intellectual culture of typology which included
taxonomy, morphology, physiognomics (discussed by Neurath in 1921),
eugenics and Hempel and Oppenheim&rsquo;s logical analysis of types
(Hempel and Oppenheim 1936). The resulting symbol was both an index
and an icon, in Peirce&rsquo;s semiotics, adopted by Neurath&rsquo;s
American intellectual ally and encyclopedia co-editor, Charles Morris
(Lupton 1986). Morris offered an American-inspired general theory of
signs, which synthesized the formal accounts by Leibniz, Frege,
Russell and Carnap, with naturalistic and pragmatist accounts of
knowledge, language, communication and social behavior by William
James, Charles Peirce and George Herbert Mead. </p>

<p>
Like the political context, a broader context of modernist ideas,
projects, practitioners and institutions straddles the boundary
between art and philosophy, education and politics, theory and
practice, individual and social. In 1929 the architect Josef Frank
(brother of physicist and fellow Circle member Philip Frank) gave a
talk to the Verein Ernst Mach, &lsquo;Modern world conception and
architecture&rsquo;. Frank became the chief architect for the Austrian
model housing estate (<em>Werkbundsiedlung</em>) and even design
Neurath&rsquo;s Social and Economic Museum when it moved to the ground
floor of the New Town Hall. Frank compartmentalized the space into
areas where charts were displayed together around one topic and people
were brought together to discuss them (Neurath M. 1974, 142). Carnap,
Feigl and Neurath gave lectures at the Bauhaus School in Dessau. Franz
Roh, author of <em>Post-Expressionism</em> (1925), was a close friend
of Carnap from their student days in Jena and intellectual motor of
the modernist <em>Neue Sachlichkeit</em> (New Objectivity or
Factuality) movement. The anti-metaphysical, formal, constructive, and
pragmatic character of logical empiricist works resonated with the
constructive, reformist, anti-ornamental, functional and international
aesthetics of modernism (Galison 1990, Galison 1996, Dhams 2004, and
for a less mechanical and foundationalist reading of the modernist
connection, Potochnik and Yap 2006). </p>

<p>
Neurath lectured on 27 May 1929 with the talk &lsquo;Pictorial
statistics and the Present&rsquo; and 9 June 1930 with &lsquo;History
and economy; two lectures&rsquo;. Carnap lectured during the third
week of October 1929 with &lsquo;Science and Life&rsquo;, &lsquo;Task
and content of science&rsquo;, &lsquo;The logical construction of the
world&rsquo;, and &lsquo;The four-dimensional world of modern
physics&rsquo; (Dahms 2004, 362-6). Carnap told his audience &lsquo;I
work in science, and you in visible forms; the two are only different
sides of a single life&rsquo; (Galison, 1990, 710). Frank became a
founding member of the Congr&egrave;s Internationale
d&rsquo;Architecture Moderne started at La Sarraz, Switzerland, in
1928, chaired by Cornelius van Eesteren, city planner in Amsterdam.
The CIAM&rsquo;s philosophy became analytical, analysis through survey
preceded synthesis in design. The Netherlands became the main
destination for immigration of German architects, especially
modernists associated to the New Objectivity and Bauhaus movements.
The CIAM invited Neurath to become a member and to participate at
their fourth congress, in 1933, between Marseille and Athens, where an
exhibition was held on &lsquo;The Functional City&rsquo; to speak on
the Vienna Method of picture language: &lsquo;the problems of urbanism
are fundamentally problems of social order. But those are better
represented in the form of schemes of visual statistics than in the
form of geographic maps.&rsquo; (Neurath 1933, 1154, quoted in Faludi
406; Vossoughian 2008; Burke et al. 2014). Inseparable from the
cognitive theory of visual language was a pluralist, anti-foundational
theory of knowledge and planning: Experts and planners, with analyses,
arguments and calculations can only put forth (incommensurable)
alternative possibilities, patterns or solutions but reach no definite
unique conclusion, which requires a &lsquo;preparedness to act&rsquo;,
&lsquo;making a decision of performing an action&rsquo; based on a
&lsquo;path of life&rsquo; and attitude.</p>

<p>
With Morris as co-editor of the International Encyclopedia for Unified
Science, Neurath felt encouraged to plan for a visual Thesaurus (an
extension of children&rsquo;s education and the Enlightenment
Encyclopedic tradition he discussed with Einstein). Morris contributed
an essay &lsquo;Foundations of the Theory of Signs&rsquo; (Morris
1938) as a framework for understanding the intersubjectivity of
scientific language and knowledge, with a reference to iconic signs,
although without an explicit reference to Neurath&rsquo;s Isotype. He
would mention Neurath&rsquo;s plan of the visual thesaurus in Isotype
language in his personal account of the Encyclopedia (Morris 1960,
also in Neurath 1973, 67). </p>

<p>
The visualized concept could be used in charts to convey quantitative
information. The signs formed a language through their design: through
reduction (empiricist abstraction) and consistency (coherence) in
design. We have here the linguistic turn and the logical and
empiricist dimensions (M&uuml;ller 1991). The semiotics of the
pictorial language is based on rules that constrain the design of
symbols (M&uuml;ller 1991): (1) Basic symbols must be self-evident,
clear in themselves, representatives of a general concept or type; (2)
symbols must be independent of color; (3) the use of color is not
regulated in general; (4) symbols must be drawn without perspective;
(5) symbols must leave a vivid lasting impression on the mind; (6)
symbols must be combinable; (7) symbol can stand for a number of
things, as a graphic unit, and a number of symbols then stand for a
corresponding multiple number of things; (8) pictorial statistics are
to be red from top left to bottom right like a book, except when
comparing national statistics, on a geographical map; (9) combinations
of symbols may form a unit of information like a story. Clearly, the
pictorial language is semantically, syntactically and pragmatically
limited and underdeveloped. In addition, its transmission relied on
exemplars and training rather than an explicit theory (Gro&szlig;
2019).</p>

<p>
No rules of translation between the verbal and iconic were univocal.
The relation between the quantitative, verbal, and expert information,
and the final visual representation was described as a transformation,
and the expert in charge of carrying out this task was called a
transformer (<em>Transformator</em>), Marie Reidemeister, later Marie
Neurath, trained in mathematics and art was a chief transformer
(Neurath 1933/1973, 222; Neurath, M. 1974, 136; Kinross 1990, 42; and
Burke et al. 2014). </p>

<p>
The use of pictures in education and economic thinking required a
relational and constructive perspective (Nemeth 2019). Like Gestalt
psychology and aesthetics, art history, cartography, geography,
medicine, engineering, industrial management, statistics and other
disciplines relevant to the project at hand, the production of Isotype
work was an instance of scientific attitude through its commitment to
empirical testing and a cooperative, holistic and synthetic process of
production: at the levels of graphic design and intellectual
disciplinary integration. The scientific dimension of Isotype work was
established by the empirical status of its source sciences (Neurath,
M. 1974, 136); testing was hardly strict or systematic. </p>

<p>
Testing educational materials and producing visual attraction to
information as a cognitive property took advantage of opportunities to
reach target audiences developed by the educational institutions and
by the economy; in particular, marketing practices. Regarding the
latter, Neurath praised the value of some techniques in advertising
(Neurath 1944, 57, and Neurath 1925/1973, 214). Regarding testing, for
still images in Vienna Marie Neurath mentions
&lsquo;experiments&rsquo; which &lsquo;were made whether such
arrangements affected understandability&rsquo; (Neurath M. 1974, 131).
In The Hague, according to Neurath, Isotype material was given to
children of ages 4-10 at a Montessori school and psychology students
monitored peoples&rsquo; reactions to charts at public exhibition
(Neurath 1946, 99). About educational films, including Neurath&rsquo;s
animations for producer and director Paul Rotha&rsquo;s documentaries,
were often tested as part of the marketing research practices adopted
by production companies to test audiences at controlled screenings
calls &lsquo;mass observations&rsquo; (see, for instance, Marie
Neurath&rsquo;s reference to &lsquo;testing [films&rsquo;]
effectiveness&rsquo; during public viewings, in Neurath M., 1974, 143,
and the Report on &lsquo;Short Diagrammatic Film&rsquo; From
Mass-Observation M-O 25.11.41, in Neurath-Rotha Correspondence,
Isotype Institute Archive, University of Reading; Cat forthcoming and
Cat and Alford forthcoming).</p>

<p>
But the general success of the visual language was suggested by the
international scale of the commissions received and instruction for
the application of the method: from Russia, between 1931 and 1934,
Mexico in 1936, and the US, to West Africa (Burke et al. 2014).
After touring Germany and exhibitions in The Hague and Chicago in
1929, in 1931 the Soviet embassy in Vienna invited Neurath to
establish a Museum of Economy and Society in Moscow. The Council of
People&rsquo;s Commissars decreed: &lsquo;All public and co-operative
organisations, unions and schools are directed to use picture
statistics according to the method of Dr. Neurath.&rsquo;
Neurath&rsquo;s personal and intellectual efforts regarding unity of
science and pictorial language were enthusiastically chronicled in the
United States by his cousin Waldemar Kaempffert (Weybright 1936,
Kaempffert 1938 and Kaempffert 1939). In terms that resonated with
urban America, Neurath was described as a social scientist, social
showman and practical man (Weybright 1936). </p>

<p>
In The Hague in 1933, Neurath established the International Foundation
for Visual Education to house and continue international Isotype
activities. A year later he was in Moscow discussing Isotype method
and exhibitions with the Russian government when a Catholic fascist
government rose to power in Austria. He was denounced as a communist
and fled to exile to The Hague, where he was joined by Marie
Reidemeister and Gerd Arntz. Books became important vehicles of the
educational mission of the Isotype project, especially <em>Modern Man
in the Making</em> (1939) and <em>Tuberculosis</em> (1939). In exile
in Britain in 1940, Neurath and his wife resumed Isotype work out of a
newly created Isotype Institute Ltd, officially chaired by the
philosopher Susan Stebbing, based in Oxford and subsequently relocated
to London. </p>

<p>
The most important distinctive trait of the visual educational work of
the Isotype institute was, next to the design and publication of
books, the engagement in cinematographic work. Neurath main
collaborator and source of commissions was the socialist documentary
filmmaker Paul Rotha. Rotha was, with John Grierson and others, part
of a group of socially engaged members of the so-called British
Documentary Movement (Low 1979, Boon 2008, Cat forthcoming). They had
been inspired by the Russian Eisenstein&rsquo;s editing techniques of
<em>montage</em> and the social reformist value of objective realism:
Democracy and the improvement of social conditions demanded the shared
experience and knowledge of facts about life in society (Grierson
1939, Rotha 1936). </p>

<p>
Objectivity and realism in the documentary movement shared the
cognitive and political value of objectivity or factuality we have
seen in modernism, socialism, scientism and logical empiricism. The
documentarians&rsquo; works and views could easily straddle the grey
divide between information and propaganda, advertising and education.
The tools clearly underdetermined their possible usages. The example
of advertisement suggests that desirability of the usage or decision
cannot be determined just by the emphasis on visual language,
physicalist protocol statements, or science alone. Science and
engineering, and propaganda, may serve many masters. Voluntarism here
re-enters the picture as the necessary precondition for Rotha&rsquo;s
and Neurath&rsquo;s choice of notions of social and intellectual
ideals. Science and socialism, to the extent that they ultimately
involve ideas and ideals, objects and objectives, and require
decisions that cannot be reached by idealized inferences or
calculations alone, will stand or fall together as foundations.
Neither is privileged. Socialism is furthered by the scientific
attitude; and science is socially constructed and established, while
it is theoretically underdetermined and even possibly left
indeterminate by data; and, as Paul Feyerabend argued, even propaganda
yields acceptance and agreement (Feyerabend 1975 and private
communication). Science and socialism (or some equivalent social
ideal) may support each other, as in reflective equilibrium. </p>

<p>
Not surprisingly, then, ideological affinity, technical and pragmatic
attitude, and social and political opportunities brought Neurath and
Rotha together. Films were intellectual and social-political tools.
There was demand for childhood and adult education, especially
scientific education, and the government support of information and
war propaganda documentaries. Animation was already a developed visual
technique, so animated Isotype diagrams had a technical niche, whether
as pure-animation features (<em>A Few Ounces a Day</em> (1941)) or
part of a photographic documentary films (for instance, Rotha&rsquo;s
<em>Blood Transfusion</em> (1941), <em>World of Plenty</em> (1943) and
<em>Defeat Tuberculosis</em> (1944)). </p>

<p>
In his evaluation of the cognitive, and thereby educational values and
limitations of images mentioned, Neurath distinguished between still
images and cinematographic images (Neurath 1944b, Neurath 1925/1973,
214, Burke and Haggith 1999, Boon 2008, Burke et al. 2014). His
Isotype activities extended to both media. Yet, he noted the
limitation that moving images make comparative analyses difficult, as
the information disappears from our visual attention and cannot be
revisited (Neurath 1945/1973, 238). Film hinders what he called
meditation and argument (see above). By contrast, two of film&rsquo;s
virtues are the capacity to document the unfamiliar, especially human
customs, and turn motion into rest or complicated motion into simpler

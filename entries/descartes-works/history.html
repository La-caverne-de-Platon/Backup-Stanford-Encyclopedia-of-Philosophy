<h2>Descartes' Law Thesis</h2>

<p>
 In 1616 Descartes earned a degree and license in Canon and Civil Law
from the law school of the University of Poitiers. But, it would not be until an unexpected find in 1981
that we would know anything about his early interests in
law. While reframing a seventeenth-century engraving that had been
hanging in a museum restaurant, a curator for the Sainte-Croix Museum
discovered stuffed in the back of the engraving a public broadsheet,
printed in 1616, which advertised the oral defense of one Ren&eacute;
Descartes. As was customary for the time, a student would have
advertisements (broadsheets) of his upcoming defense printed, the
broadsheets usually containing an introduction or dedication and a
list of several statements that the student was prepared to
defend. They would be posted in public places.</p>

<p>
 In 1986 the discovery of the broadsheet was officially documented in
the <i>Archives departementales de la Vienne</i>, at
Poitiers. Jean-Robert Armogathe, Vincent Carraud, and Robert Feenstra
have verified the document's authenticity. In 1988 they published a
brief history of the document's discovery, a Latin transcription of
the original, and the first French translation in <i>Nouvelles De La
Republique Des Lettres</i>.</p>

<p>
 Descartes' broadsheet (hereafter referred to as the &ldquo;1616 Law
Thesis&rdquo;) contains an elaborately worded dedication to his
maternal uncle, Ren&eacute; Brochard, followed by a list of forty
statements--thirty-six of which would appear to be commonly held and
uncontroversial. Unfortunately, a corner of the original document has
been torn, and so the section of text containing the last four
statements, which very likely express the main (or at least the unique
part) of his thesis, is missing.</p>

<p>
 The dedication is flowery (and beautiful). It tells us of a young
Descartes who nursed at the well-springs of the liberal arts, desiring
only to &ldquo;drink in the poetical waters.&rdquo; However, he could
hear below (in the ground) the roar of a great current, which drew him to wanting to
drink from &ldquo;the wider rivers of eloquence.&rdquo; But, in time, he
discovered that neither the poetical waters nor the wider rivers of
eloquence quenched his thirst for knowing. He followed
the rivers out to the ocean, the sciences, from which all rivers of
knowledge flow (the analogy, of course, is a bit off, for rivers flow
<i>to</i> the ocean, not <i>from</i> it). He claims that at first he
wanted to drink in every river and stream. But, he came upon the
stream of his uncle, and discovered how silly his attempt at drinking
in everything was. The stream that supplied his uncle's well-spring
with the purest waters was that of the Law. And, it was to this stream
that he would dedicate the rest of his life. The metaphor changes and
Descartes tells us that a goddess had appeared to him, Themis
(Justice), and she enslaved him. He ends the dedication by expressing
his hope that his uncle, Ren&eacute; Brochard, will &ldquo;unite to me the
favor and benevolence of so lovable a goddess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
 The thesis itself deals with the legal concept of inheritance, which
is expressed by way of the forty propositions that follow the
dedication. Because of the missing section of text, it is impossible
to say with certainty what Descartes' main point was. However, given
what has survived, the bulk of it suggests that he was arguing that in
certain cases a specific branch of law, namely Singular Law, could be
applied in the making of a will.</p>

<p>
 There were several branches of Canon Law: Common Law, Universal Law,
General Law, and Singular Law. They are distinct in
light of the domain of objects over which they operate. For instance,
Common Law operates over things (owned), Universal Law over
territories, and General Law over (classes) of persons. Singular Law
operates over those individual cases which the other branches cannot
adequately handle. Since last wills deal with the dispensing of
things, they fell under the jurisdiction of Common Law.</p>

<p>
 At the beginning of the <i>1616 Law Thesis</i>, Descartes draws a
well-known distinction between Civil Law (<i>jus civilis</i>) and Law
of the Nations (<i>jus gentium</i>). The latter refers to those laws
found in common with all nations. It was sometimes referred to as
&lsquo;natural law&rsquo;. It was customary in Rome (and very likely in
seventeenth-century France) that when a strict application of Civil
Law would result in an injustice, a court could appeal to Law of the
Nations for help in hopes that a just decision could be reached.</p>

<p>
 Common Law, says Descartes, requires either that the one making the
will orally proclaim the will or state it in writing. In either case
seven witnesses are needed. Common Law is apparently very strict not
only in respect to the number of witnesses, but in respect to how the
will is proclaimed or written (and sealed), and so on. Descartes
mentions several special cases (Propositions 37-39) in which meeting
the criteria of Common Law is impossible&mdash;for example, in the case of
a soldier in battle, a farmer isolated in the countryside, or a man
who has come down with the plague. It may be impossible for them to
fulfill the seven witness criterion, for example. Justice would not be
brought about if these individuals were not able to make a last
will. Descartes's thesis seems to be that in these cases Singular Law
could be applied, and justice could be brought about. The precedent,
it seems, is the court's already appealing to Law of the Nations to
deal with those cases which Civil Law cannot handle.</p>

<h1>Temporal Logic</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Nov 29, 1999; substantive revision Fri Feb 7, 2020</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The term <em>Temporal Logic</em> has been broadly used to cover all
approaches to reasoning about time and temporal information, as well as their formal representation, within a logical framework, and also more narrowly to refer specifically to the modal-logic type of approach introduced around 1960 by Arthur Prior under the name <em>Tense Logic</em> and subsequently developed further by many logicians and computer
scientists. Applications of Temporal Logic include its use as a
formalism for clarifying philosophical issues about time, as a
framework within which to define the semantics of temporal expressions
in natural language, as a language for encoding temporal knowledge in
artificial intelligence, and as a tool for specification, formal
analysis, and verification of the executions of computer programs and
systems.</p>

<p>
Here we provide a broadly representative, yet concise and inevitably
incomplete, overview of the rich variety of temporal models and logics
introduced and studied over the past 50 years.</p>

<h2><a id="TemReaAntModDay">1. Temporal reasoning from antiquity to modern days</a></h2>

<p>
Discussions of temporality and reasoning about time go back to
antiquity, and examples can be found even in the Bible (Boyd 2014).
Zeno&rsquo;s famous flying arrow paradox refers to the nature of time
and broaches the corresponding notion of change. Much of the early
temporal discussion, however, centered around the problem of
<em>future contingents</em>, that is, the question whether statements
about future events that are neither necessary nor impossible can have
definite truth values. The most widely known and probably most cited
example is the sea-fight scenario discussed by Aristotle in <em>On
Interpretation</em> (Chapter 9). Aristotle argued that statements such
as &ldquo;There will be a sea-fight tomorrow&rdquo;, as well as the
contrary prediction &ldquo;There will not be a sea-fight
tomorrow&rdquo;, do not hold of necessity and hence lack definite
truth values at present, while conceding that it is necessary that
either there will be a sea-fight tomorrow or not. A few decades later,
the philosopher Diodorus Chronus demonstrated the problem of future
contingents in his famous <em>Master Argument</em>, which led him to
define the possible as &ldquo;what is or will be the case&rdquo;. A
detailed discussion of Diodorus&rsquo; argument is provided in e.g.
Rescher and Urquhart (1971, Chapter XVII) and the entry on
 <a href="../future-contingents/index.html">future contingents</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Philosophical discussions concerning time and the contingent future
continued in the Middle Ages, where the theme was taken up by writers
such as Peter Aureole, William of Ockham, and Luis Molina. In the
center of focus here was the question how to reconcile God&rsquo;s
foreknowledge with the idea of human freedom. Ockham, for example,
embraced the idea of a true or actual future, holding that future
contingent statements are either true or false even though only God
knows their truth values. According to Ockham, this is not to say,
however, that future contingents are necessary, meaning that there are
alternative possibilities for humans to choose from. Later, several
philosophers and logicians engaged in the problem of relating
temporality with free will, indeterminism, and the open future,
proposing various different solutions. C.S. Peirce objected to the
idea that future contingents can have definite truth values. He
advanced the view that only the present and the past are actual
whereas the future is the realm of possibility and necessity. In a
similar spirit, J. &#321;ukasiewicz devised a three-valued logic,
treating the truth values of future contingent statements as
undetermined. For a more recent philosophical discussion on free will,
indeterminism, and the open future, see e.g. Belnap et al. (2001) and
M&uuml;ller (2014).</p>

<p>
The modern era of formal temporal logic was initiated by the seminal
work of Arthur N. Prior, with important precursors such as H.
Reichenbach, J. Findlay, J. &#321;ukasiewicz, and J.
 &#321;o&#347;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 From the early 1950s, Prior introduced and analyzed in detail over
more than a decade several different versions of Tense Logic, many of
which are discussed below. Prior&rsquo;s invention of Tense Logic was
largely driven by philosophical considerations. In particular, the
Master Argument of Diodorus Chronus and the intricate relationship
between time, (in)determinism, God&rsquo;s foreknowledge, and human
freedom played a pivotal role in his work. Prior was convinced that a
proper logical approach could help to clarify and solve such
philosophical problems. He introduced temporal operators, studied
metric tense logic, was a pioneer in hybrid temporal logic, devised
two versions of branching time temporal logic, which he took to reflect the
views of Ockham and Peirce, respectively, etc. His work paved the way
for the development of the vast and diverse field of temporal logic,
with numerous important applications not only in philosophy, but also
in computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. For
more on Prior&rsquo;s views and work, see Hasle et al. (2017);
Blackburn et al. (2019); and the entry on
 <a href="../prior/index.html">Arthur Prior</a>.
 A comprehensive overview of the history of temporal reasoning and
logics is provided in &Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m and Hasle (1995). See
also &Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m and Hasle (2006) and Dyke and Bardon
(2013, Part I).</p>

<h2><a id="ForModTim">2. Formal models of time</a></h2>

<p>
The ontological nature and properties of time give rise to fundamental
philosophical questions, which find their expression in the rich
variety of formal models of time employed in temporal logics. For
example, is time instant-based or interval-based? Is it discrete,
dense, or continuous? Does time have a beginning or an end? Is it
linear, branching, or circular? Before we turn to the formal languages
of temporal logics and their semantics, we briefly introduce below the
two most basic types of formal models of time together with some of
their pertinent properties: instant-based and interval-based
models.</p>

<h3><a id="InsBasModFloTim">2.1 Instant-based models of time</a></h3>

<p>
In instant-based models the primitive temporal entities are points in
time, viz. <em>time instants</em>, and the basic relationship between
them (besides equality) is <em>temporal precedence</em>. Thus, the
flow of time is represented by a non-empty set of time instants \(T\)
with a binary relation \(\prec\) of precedence on it: \(\mathcal{T} =
\left\langle T, \prec \right\rangle.\)</p>

<p>
There are some basic properties which can naturally be imposed on
instant-based flows of time. The temporal precedence relation is
usually required to be a strict partial ordering, that is, an
irreflexive, transitive, and hence asymmetric relation. Sometimes,
however, it is assumed to be reflexive, and then the antisymmetry
condition is added. The relevant properties are listed below.</p>

<p>
One fundamental distinction in the realm of instant-based models of
time is the distinction between linear models, where the flow of time
is depicted as a line, and backward-linear models, which allow a
tree-like representation, supporting the view that the past is fixed
(and hence linear) while the future may be open (branching into
multiple possible futures). In either case, the temporal ordering may
or may not contain minimal or maximal elements, corresponding to first
or last instants in time, respectively.</p>

<p>
Another important distinction is between discrete models of time, which are prevalent in computer science, and dense or continuous ones, which are more common in natural sciences and
philosophy. In forward-discrete
(backward-discrete) models, each time instant that has a successor
(predecessor) always has a corresponding immediate successor
(immediate predecessor). In dense models, by contrast, between any two
subsequent time instants, there is another instant.</p>

<p>
Many, but not all, possible properties which an instant-based model of
time \(\mathcal{T} = \left\langle T, \prec \right\rangle\) may have
can be expressed by first-order sentences as follows (where
\(\preceq\) is an abbreviation of \(x\prec y \lor x=y\)):</p>

<ul>

<li><em>reflexivity</em>: \(\forall x (x\prec x);\)</li>

<li><em>irreflexivity</em>: \(\forall x\lnot (x\prec x);\)</li>

<li><em>transitivity</em>: \(\forall x\forall y\forall z(x\prec
y\wedge y\prec z\rightarrow x\prec z);\)</li>

<li><em>asymmetry</em>: \(\forall x\forall y \lnot(x\prec y\wedge
y\prec x);\)</li>

<li><em>anti-symmetry</em>: \(\forall x\forall y(x\prec y\wedge y\prec
x\rightarrow x=y);\)</li>

<li><em>linearity (trichotomy, connectedness)</em>: \(\forall x\forall
y(x=y\vee x\prec y\vee y\prec x);\)</li>

<li><em>forward-linearity</em>: \(\forall x\forall y\forall z(z\prec
x\wedge z\prec y\rightarrow (x=y \vee x \prec y\vee y\prec x));\)</li>

<li><em>backward-linearity</em>: \(\forall x\forall y\forall z(x\prec
z\wedge y\prec z\rightarrow (x=y \vee x \prec y\vee y\prec x));\)</li>

<li><em>beginning</em>: \(\exists x\lnot\exists y(y\prec x);\)</li>

<li><em>end</em>: \(\exists x\lnot\exists y(x\prec y);\)</li>

<li><em>no beginning</em>: \(\forall x\exists y(y\prec x);\)</li>

<li><em>no end (unboundedness)</em>: \(\forall x\exists y(x\prec
y);\)</li>

<li><em>density</em>: \(\forall x\forall y(x\prec y\rightarrow \exists
z(x\prec z\wedge z\prec y));\)</li>

<li><em>forward-discreteness</em>: \(\forall x\forall y(x\prec
y\rightarrow \exists z(x\prec z \wedge z\preceq y \wedge \lnot\exists
u(x\prec u\wedge u\prec z)));\)</li>

<li><em>backward-discreteness</em>: \(\forall x\forall y(y\prec
x\rightarrow \exists z(z\prec x \wedge y\preceq z \wedge \lnot\exists
u(z\prec u\wedge u\prec x))).\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that, in linear models, the two discreteness conditions simplify
to </p>

<ul>

<li>\(\forall x\forall y(x\prec y\rightarrow \exists z(x\prec z \wedge
\forall u(x\prec u \rightarrow z\preceq u)))\) and </li>

<li>\(\forall x\forall y(y\prec x\rightarrow \exists z(z\prec x \wedge
\forall u(u\prec x \rightarrow u\preceq z))),\) respectively.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Key examples of properties of instant-based models of time that cannot
be expressed by first-order sentences, but require a second-order
language with quantification over sets, are <em>continuity</em>,
<em>well-ordering</em>, and the <em>finite interval property</em>.
Continuity demands that there be no gaps in the temporal order. Not
only must the temporal order be dense, it must also be <em>Dedekind
complete</em>, i.e., every non-empty set of time instants that has an
upper bound has a least upper bound. An example is the ordered set of
real numbers, while a non-example is the ordering of the rational
numbers: consider e.g. the set of all rational numbers whose square is
less than 2. An instant-based model of time is well-ordered if every
non-empty, linear set of time instants has a least element, and it has
the finite interval property if between any two subsequent time
instants there are at most finitely many instants. The natural numbers
are well-ordered and have the finite interval property, the negative
integers are not well-ordered but still have the finite interval
property, and the positive rationals or reals are neither well-ordered
nor do they have the finite interval property. As we will see in
 <a href="#ExpTemProTLExtMat">Section 3.6</a>,
 these second-order properties can be expressed in propositional
temporal languages.</p>

<h3><a id="IntBasModTim">2.2 Interval-based models of time</a></h3>

<p>
Instant-based models of time are often not suitable for reasoning
about events with duration, which are better modeled if the underlying
temporal ontology uses <em>time intervals</em>, i.e. periods rather
than instants, as the primitive entities. The roots of interval-based
temporal reasoning can be traced back to Zeno and Aristotle
(&Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m and Hasle 1995). In an interval-based setting,
Zeno&rsquo;s famous flying arrow paradox (&ldquo;If at each instant
the flying arrow stands still, how is movement possible?&rdquo;) does
not arise. Other examples that naturally require interval-based
reasoning are: &ldquo;Last night Alice cried a lot while writing the
letter, and then she calmed down&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bill was drinking
his tea when the postman came&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Interval-based models usually presuppose linear time. Still, they are
ontologically richer than instant-based models, as there are many more
possible relationships between time intervals than between time
instants. An interval-based model of time can, for instance, include
the relations <em>temporal precedence</em> \(\prec,\)
<em>inclusion</em> \(\sqsubseteq,\) and <em>overlap</em> \(O\) over a
set of time intervals \(T\): formally, \(\mathcal{T}= \left\langle
T,\prec,\sqsubseteq, O \right\rangle.\) Some natural properties of
such interval-based relations and models include: </p>

<ul>

<li><em>reflexivity of</em> \(\sqsubseteq:\) \(\forall x(x\sqsubseteq
x);\)</li>

<li><em>anti-symmetry of</em> \(\sqsubseteq:\) \(\forall x\forall
y(x\sqsubseteq y\wedge y\sqsubseteq x\rightarrow x=y);\)</li>

<li><em>atomicity of</em> \(\sqsubseteq\) (for discrete time):
\(\forall x\exists y(y\sqsubseteq x\wedge \forall z(z\sqsubseteq
y\rightarrow z=y));\)</li>

<li><em>downward monotonicity of \(\prec\) w.r.t.
\(\sqsubseteq:\)</em> \(\forall x\forall y\forall z(x\prec y\wedge
z\sqsubseteq x\rightarrow z\prec y);\)</li>

<li><em>symmetry of</em> \(O\): \(\forall x\forall y(xOy\rightarrow
yOx);\)</li>

<li><em>overlapping intervals intersect in a subinterval</em>:
<br />
\(\forall x\forall y (xOy \rightarrow \exists z( z \sqsubseteq x \land
z \sqsubseteq y \land \forall u ( u \sqsubseteq x \land u \sqsubseteq
y \to u \sqsubseteq z)));\)</li>

<li><em>monotonicity of \(\sqsubseteq\) w.r.t. \(O\):</em> \(\forall
x\forall y \forall z(x \sqsubseteq y \land xOz \rightarrow z
\sqsubseteq y \lor zOy).\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
In an influential early work on the formal study of interval-based
temporal ontology and reasoning in AI, Allen (1983) considered the
family of all binary relations that can arise between two intervals in
a linear order, subsequently called <em>Allen relations</em>. These 13
relations, displayed in
 <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>,
 are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive, i.e., exactly one of
them holds between any given pair of strict intervals (excluding
point-intervals). Moreover, they turn out to be definable in terms of
only two of them, viz. in terms of &lsquo;meets&rsquo; and
&lsquo;met-by&rsquo; (Allen 1983).</p>

Given an abstract structure defined by a certain set of interval
relations of arbitrary arity that are required to satisfy certain
properties, the question arises whether it can be represented by means
of a concrete interval-based model over linear time. Answers are
provided by various representation theorems, see e.g. van Benthem
(1983); Ladkin (1987); and Venema (1990).</p>

<h3><a id="InsVsIntBasModTim">2.3 Instant-based vs. interval-based models of time</a></h3>

<p>
The choice between instants and intervals as the primary objects of
temporal ontology has been a highly debated philosophical theme since
the times of Zeno and Aristotle. Technically, the two types of
temporal ontologies are closely related, and they are reducible to
each other: on the one hand, time intervals can be defined by pairs of
time instants (beginning and end); on the other hand, a time instant
can be construed as a degenerate interval, viz. as a point-interval
whose beginning and end points coincide.</p>

<p>
Still, the technical reductions do not resolve the semantic question
whether sentences are to be evaluated with respect to instants or with
respect to intervals, and one may argue that both instants and
intervals are needed as mutually complementary. Two-sorted
point-interval models were studied in e.g. Balbiani et al. (2011), and
more complex models of time have been investigated as well, including
models of time granularity (Euzenat and Montanari 2005), which allow
for different resolution levels of temporal intervals (e.g. minutes,
hours, days, years, etc.), metric and layered temporal models
(Montanari 1996), etc.</p>

<p>
Here we discuss both instant-based and interval-based temporal logics.
For further discussion on the ontological primacy of instants versus
intervals in temporal logics, see Hamblin (1972); Kamp (1979);
Humberstone (1979); Galton (1996); as well as van Benthem (1983) for a
detailed comparative exploration of both approaches. A more
philosophical and historical overview is provided in e.g.
&Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m and Hasle (1995; 2006); Dyke and Bardon (2013);
and Meyer (2013).</p>

<h2><a id="PriBasTenLogTL">3. Prior&rsquo;s basic tense logic TL</a></h2>

<p>
In this section, we discuss the language, semantics, and
axiomatization of the basic tense logic TL introduced by Prior (1957;
1967; 1968), the founding father of temporal logic. Prior&rsquo;s
motivation for inventing tense logic was largely philosophical, and
his ideas were strongly inspired by the use of tense in natural
language. The innovative feature of Prior&rsquo;s approach was that he
treated propositions as tensed rather than tenseless. Technically,
this was achieved by the introduction of temporal operators into the
language, which were given a modal-logic type of semantics. In view of
the pivotal role that tense is playing in his framework, Prior himself
referred to his account as <em>Tense Logic</em>, whereas nowadays the
more general expression <em>Temporal Logic</em> is prevailing.</p>

<h3><a id="PriTenOpe">3.1 Prior&rsquo;s tense operators</a></h3>

<p>
The basic language of Prior&rsquo;s Tense Logic TL extends the
standard propositional language (with atomic propositions and
truth-functional connectives) by four temporal operators with intended
meaning as follows:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li><span class="tag">\(P\):</span> <span class="sen">&ldquo;It has at
some time been the case that &hellip;&rdquo;</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">\(F\):</span> <span class="sen">&ldquo;It will
at some time be the case that &hellip;&rdquo;</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">\(H\):</span> <span class="sen">&ldquo;It has
always been the case that &hellip;&rdquo;</span> </li>

<li><span class="tag">\(G\):</span> <span class="sen">&ldquo;It will
always be the case that &hellip;&rdquo;</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
For example, &ldquo;It will always be the case that Prior invented
Tense Logic&rdquo; translates in TL as \(GP(\mathsf{Prior\ invents\ TL})\) and has the formal reading &ldquo;It will always be the
case that it has at some time been the case that Prior invents Tense
Logic&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
TL comprises one pair of temporal operators for the past, \(P\) and
\(H\), and one pair of temporal operators for the future, \(F\) and
\(G\). The operators \(P\) and \(F\) are often referred to as the
&lsquo;weak&rsquo; temporal operators, while \(H\) and \(G\) are known
as the &lsquo;strong&rsquo; ones. The respective past and future
operators are duals of each other, i.e., they are interdefinable by
means of the following equivalences:</p> 

\[
P\varphi \equiv \neg H\neg \varphi, H\varphi \equiv \neg P\neg
\varphi \text{ and } F\varphi \equiv \neg G\neg \varphi, G\varphi \equiv \neg
F\neg \varphi.
\]

<p>
In light of these equivalences, the set of formulae of TL can be
recursively defined as follows, over a given set of atomic
propositions \(PROP\): 

\[
\varphi := p \in {PROP} \mid \bot \mid \lnot \varphi \mid (\varphi \land \varphi) \mid
P\varphi \mid F\varphi.
\] 

 The truth-functional connectives
\(\vee,\to,\) and \(\leftrightarrow\) are definable in terms of
\(\lnot\) and \(\land\) as usual. Besides, we can define \(A\varphi
=H\varphi \wedge \varphi \wedge G\varphi\) and, dually, \(E\varphi
=P\varphi \vee \varphi \vee F\varphi,\) which on linear flows of time
mean &ldquo;always&rdquo; and &ldquo;sometime&rdquo;,
respectively.</p>

<p>
As said, Prior&rsquo;s introduction of the temporal operators was
initially motivated by the use of tense in natural language, and
various tenses in natural language can, at least approximately, be
captured in TL. For example:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">\(P\varphi\)</span> <span class="sen">
corresponds to &ldquo;\(\varphi\) <em>was</em> the case&rdquo; or
&ldquo;\(\varphi\) <em>has been</em> the case&rdquo;.</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">\(F\varphi\)</span> <span class="sen">
corresponds to &ldquo;\(\varphi\) <em>will be</em> the
case&rdquo;.</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">\(PP\varphi\)</span> <span class="sen">corresponds
to &ldquo;<em>\(\varphi\) had been</em> the
case&rdquo;.</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">\(FP\varphi\)</span> <span class="sen">corresponds
to &ldquo;<em>\(\varphi\) will have been</em>
the case&rdquo;.</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">\(PF\varphi\)</span> <span class="sen">corresponds
to &ldquo;\(\varphi\) <em>would be</em> the
case&rdquo; or &ldquo;\(\varphi\) <em>was going to be</em> the
case&rdquo;.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Hamblin and Prior showed that, in models of linear time, any sequence
of temporal operators reduces to a sequence of at most two operators.
In total, they identified 15 different such combinations &mdash; or
<em>tenses</em>, as they call them &mdash; that can be expressed in TL
over linear flows of time (see Prior 1967, Chapter III.5). Even though
these combinations seem to surpass the number of verbal tenses in e.g.
English, there are also temporal properties of natural language that
cannot be captured in TL: Prior&rsquo;s temporal operators are, for
instance, not very well suited to model distinctions of aspect (e.g.
the distinction between &ldquo;I wrote a letter&rdquo; and &ldquo;I
was writing a letter&rdquo;), which are arguably more adequately dealt
with in an interval-based framework. For details, see Kuhn and Portner
(2006) and the entry on
 <a href="../tense-aspect/index.html">tense and aspect</a>.</p>
 
<h3><a id="SemTL">3.2 Semantics of TL</a></h3>

<p>
The standard semantics of TL is essentially a Kripke-style semantics,
familiar from modal logic. In modal logic, sentences are evaluated
over so-called Kripke frames consisting of a non-empty set of possible
worlds and an accessibility relation between them. In temporal logic,
the possible worlds are time instants, and the accessibility relation
has a concrete interpretation in terms of temporal precedence. In
other words, sentences are evaluated over instant-based models of time
\(\mathcal{T}=\left\langle T, \prec \right\rangle\), hereafter called
<em>temporal frames</em>. Note that so far no conditions, like
transitivity, irreflexivity, etc., are imposed on the precedence
relation \(\prec\).</p>

<p>
Given a set of atomic propositions \(PROP\), a <em>temporal model</em>
for TL is a triple \(\mathcal{M}= \left\langle T, \prec, V
\right\rangle\) where \(\mathcal{T} =\left\langle T, \prec
\right\rangle\) is a temporal frame and \(V\) is a <em>valuation</em>
assigning to each atomic proposition \(p\in{PROP}\) the set of time
instants \(V(p) \subseteq T\) at which \(p\) is considered true.
(Equivalently, the valuation can be given by a function \(I:
T\times{PROP}\to \{\mathit{true},\mathit{false}\},\) which assigns a
truth value to each atomic proposition at each time instant in the
temporal frame, or by a <em>labeling</em> or <em>state
description</em> \(L: T \to \mathcal{P}({PROP})\), which assigns to
each time instant the set of atomic propositions that are considered
true at that instant.)</p>

<p>
The <em>truth of an arbitrary formula \(\varphi\) of TL at a given
time instant \(t\) in a given temporal model \(\mathcal{M}\)</em>
(denoted \(\mathcal{M},t \models\varphi\)) is then defined inductively
as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t \models p\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp; \(t \in V(p)\), for
\(p \in {PROP}\);</li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t \not\models \bot\) &nbsp; (i.e., it is not the
case that \(\mathcal{M},t \models \bot\));</li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t \models \neg\varphi\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp;
\(\mathcal{M},t \not\models\varphi\);</li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t \models \varphi \wedge \psi\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp;
\(\mathcal{M},t \models\varphi\) and \(\mathcal{M},t
\models\psi\);</li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t \models P\varphi\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp;
\(\mathcal{M},t'\models \varphi\) for some time instant \(t'\) such
that \(t'\prec t\);</li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t \models F\varphi\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp;
\(\mathcal{M},t'\models \varphi\) for some time instant \(t'\) such
that \(t\prec t'\).</li>
</ul>

<p>That is, given a temporal model \(\mathcal{M}\), a formula of the form
\(P\varphi\) is true at an instant \(t\) iff \(\varphi\) is true at
some earlier instant \(t',\) and \(F\varphi\) is true at \(t\) iff
\(\varphi\) is true at some later instant \(t'.\) Consequently, for
the duals \(H\) and \(G\), it holds that \(H\varphi\) is true at \(t\)
iff \(\varphi\) is true at all earlier instants \(t',\) and
\(G\varphi\) is true at \(t\) iff \(\varphi\) is true at all later
instants \(t'.\)</p>

<ul>
<li>\(\mathcal{M},t \models H\varphi\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp;
\(\mathcal{M},t'\models \varphi\) for all time instants \(t'\) such
that \(t'\prec t\);</li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t \models G\varphi\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp;
\(\mathcal{M},t'\models \varphi\) for all time instants \(t'\) such
that \(t\prec t'\).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that, from the point of view of modal logic,
there are, formally speaking, two different accessibility relations
involved here: an &lsquo;earlier-relation&rsquo; in the case of the
past operators and a &lsquo;later-relation&rsquo; in the case of the
future operators. In temporal logic, these two relations are uniformly
captured by a single precedence relation; after all,
&lsquo;earlier&rsquo; and &lsquo;later&rsquo; are just converses of
each other (i.e., \(t\) is earlier than \(t'\) iff \(t'\) is later than
\(t\)).</p>

<p>
A formula \(\varphi\) of TL is <em>valid in a temporal model
\(\mathcal{M}\)</em> (denoted \(\mathcal{M} \models \varphi\)) iff it
is true at every time instant in that model. Moreover, we say that
\(\varphi\) is <em>valid in a temporal frame</em> \(\mathcal{T}\)
(denoted \(\mathcal{T} \models \varphi\)) iff it is valid in every
model on that frame. Accordingly, a formula \(\varphi\) is
<em>valid</em> (denoted \(\models \varphi\)) iff it is valid in all
temporal frames, i.e. true at all time instants in all temporal
models. A formula \(\varphi\) is <em>satisfiable</em> iff its negation
is not valid, i.e. if \(\varphi\) is true at some time instant in some
temporal model.</p>

<h3><a id="StaTraTLFirOrdLog">3.3 Standard translation of TL into first-order logic</a></h3>

<p>
As in the case of modal logic, the language and semantics of TL can be
translated into classical first-order logic (see e.g. van Benthem
1983).</p>

<p>
Suppose that the set of atomic propositions of TL is
\({PROP}=\left\{p_{0},p_{1},...\right\}\), and let \(L_{1}\) be a
first-order language with \(=,\) a binary predicate symbol \(R,\) and
a denumerable set of unary predicate symbols
\(\mathcal{P}=\left\{P_{0},P_{1},...\right\}\), one for each atomic
proposition of TL. The <em>standard translation</em> \(ST\) of TL into
\(L_{1}\) is defined as follows, where \(\theta[y/x]\) is the result
of substituting \(y\) for all free occurrences of \(x\) in
\(\theta\):</p>

<ul>

<li>\(ST(p_{i}) = P_{i}(x);\)</li>

<li>\(ST(\bot) = \bot;\)</li>

<li>\(ST(\lnot\varphi) = \lnot ST(\varphi);\)</li>

<li>\(ST(\varphi \land \psi) = ST(\varphi)\land ST(\psi);\)</li>

<li>\(ST(P\varphi) = \exists y(yRx\wedge ST(\varphi)[y/x]),\)
where \(y\) is a fresh variable;</li>

<li>\(ST(F\varphi) = \exists y(xRy\wedge ST(\varphi)[y/x]),\)
where \(y\) is a fresh variable.</li>
</ul>

<p>It then follows that</p>

<ul>

<li>\(ST(H\varphi) = \forall y(yRx\rightarrow ST(\varphi)[y/x]);\)</li>

<li>\(ST(G\varphi) = \forall y(xRy\rightarrow ST(\varphi)[y/x]).\)</li>

</ul>

<p>
For example:</p> 
\[ST(Gp_{1}\lor FHp_{2})=\forall y(xRy\rightarrow
P_{1}y)\lor \exists y(xRy\wedge \forall z(zRy\rightarrow
P_{2}z)).\]

<p>
Not every first-order formula has a correspondent in TL. Actually,
with a little extra care to re-use individual variables, TL can be
translated in the two-variable fragment FO\(^{2}\) of first-order
logic, which eventually implies decidability of validity in TL (for
validity in FO\(^{2}\) is decidable, as shown by Gr&auml;del and Otto
1999). For instance, the example above can be re-written as</p>

\[ST(Gp_{1}\lor FHp_{2})=\forall y(xRy\rightarrow
P_{1}y)\lor \exists y(xRy\wedge \forall x(xRy\rightarrow P_{2}x)).\]

<p>
Given the standard translation, every temporal model
\(\mathcal{M}=\left\langle T,\prec ,V\right\rangle\) can be regarded
as an \(L_{1}\)-model by interpreting \(R\) as \(\prec\) and each
\(P_{i}\) as \(V(p_{i}).\) Then:</p> 

\[\begin{align}
\mathcal{M},t  \models \varphi \ &amp; \text{ iff } \mathcal{M}\models  ST(\varphi)[x:=t], \\
\mathcal{M} \models \varphi \ &amp; \text{ iff } \mathcal{M}\models \forall x ST(\varphi).
\end{align}\]

<p>
Thus, validity of a formula of TL in a temporal model is a first-order
property. Validity in a temporal frame, on the other hand, turns out to be a
second-order property as it involves quantification over valuations.
If we treat the unary predicates from \(\mathcal{P}\) as predicate
variables of a second-order language \(L_{2},\) every temporal frame
\(\mathcal{T} = \langle T,\prec\rangle\) can be regarded as an
\(L_{2}\)-model, where the predicate variables represent the valuation
of the respective atomic propositions. Let \(\forall \overline{P}\varphi
\) denote the universal closure of an \(L_{2}\)-formula \(\varphi\) over
all predicate variables occurring in it. Then:</p> 

\[\begin{align}
\mathcal{T}\models \varphi \ &amp; \text{ iff }\mathcal{T}\models \forall \overline{P}\forall x ST(\varphi), \\
\models \varphi \ &amp; \text{ iff }\models \forall \overline{P}\forall x ST(\varphi). 
\end{align}\]

<p>
The standard translation of TL into first-order logic enables a
systematic treatment of various aspects of temporal logic with the
tools and techniques of classical logic (see e.g. Blackburn et al.
2006). As we will see in
 <a href="#ExpTemProTLExtMat">Section 3.6</a>,
 however, not all first-order properties of temporal frames are
definable by temporal formulae; and vice versa, not all properties of
temporal frames that can be expressed by formulae of TL are
first-order definable. A non-trivial correspondence between temporal
logic and first-order logic as alternative languages for describing
properties of time emerges.</p>

<h3><a id="TLVsFirOrdLogMcTTimSer">3.4 Tense logic, first-order logic, and McTaggart&rsquo;s time series</a></h3>

<p>
The standard translation discussed in the previous section links the
semantics of Prior&rsquo;s basic tense logic to first-order logic.
Yet, there are crucial differences between the two approaches to
formalizing the logic of time. In fact, in the early days of temporal
logic, Prior&rsquo;s approach was perceived as a rival to more
conventional approaches using first-order logic. The rivalry between
tense logic and first-order logic can be seen as reflecting a
fundamental distinction concerning the nature of time, namely the
distinction between the A-series and the B-series of time introduced
by McTaggart (1908).</p>

<p>
The A-series essentially amounts to a characterization of time and
temporal order in terms of past, present, and future. The B-series, in
contrast, is based on the notions &lsquo;earlier&rsquo; and
&lsquo;later&rsquo;. Thus, whereas the A-series presupposes a
distinguished present, the B-series involves an overarching, global
perspective on time. McTaggart argued that the B-series is
insufficient because it lacks an appropriate notion of change, and he
rejected the A-series as inconsistent because what is future now will
be past, which, according to him, requires that one and the same time
instant has incompatible properties. From this he concluded that time
is unreal. For a detailed discussion of McTaggart&rsquo;s account and
its philosophical relevance, see Ingthorsson (2016) and the entry on
 <a href="../time/index.html">time</a>.</p>
 
<p>
There is a close correspondence between the A-series of time and tense
logic, on the one hand, and between the B-series and first-order
logic, on the other, as was already noted by Prior (1967, Chapter 1)
himself. Consider, for example, the sentence &ldquo;It is dark, it was
light, and it will be light again.&rdquo; This sentence can be
formalized in TL as 

\[\mathsf{dark} \wedge P(\mathsf{light}) \wedge F(\mathsf{light})\] 

while its first-order formulation reads 

\[\mathsf{dark}(t_1) \wedge \exists t_0 (t_0 \prec t_1 \wedge \mathsf{light}(t_0)) \wedge \exists t_2 (t_1 \prec t_2 \wedge \mathsf{light}(t_2)).\] 

 The TL formula consists of tensed propositions
(propositions not containing temporal operators are present tensed),
and it invokes the local perspective of the present. In the
first-order formula, in contrast, propositions are untensed or
tenseless. Here we are provided with predicates of time instants
rather than with tenses, and the perspective involved is a global
perspective from outside of time. Prior felt that not everything that
can be expressed in a tensed language can likewise be expressed in a
tenseless one, his classic example being: &ldquo;Thank goodness,
that&rsquo;s over!&rdquo; (Prior 1959).</p>

<h3><a id="AxiSysMatForTL">3.5 Axiomatic system \(\mathbf{K}_{t}\) for TL</a></h3>

<p>
Like every formal logical system, temporal logic has two major
aspects: a <em>semantic</em> and a <em>deductive</em> one. In this section, we
present a deductive system for validity in TL, viz. the <em>minimal
temporal logic \(\mathbf{K}_{t}\)</em>. The logic \(\mathbf{K}_{t}\)
is an axiomatic system, i.e., it is given by a list of axioms and
inference rules. The system was first studied by Lemmon, following
earlier axiomatizations proposed by Hamblin and Prior (see Rescher and
Urquhart 1971, Chapter VI). </p>

<p>
The list of axioms of the minimal temporal logic \(\mathbf{K}_{t}\)
extends the list of classical propositional logic by the following
four axiom schemata:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">\((K_G)\)</span> <span class="sen">\(G(\varphi
\rightarrow \psi)\rightarrow (G\varphi \rightarrow G\psi)\)
</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">\((K_H)\)</span> <span class="sen">\(H(\varphi
\rightarrow \psi)\rightarrow (H\varphi \rightarrow H\psi)\)
</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(GP)</span> <span class="sen">\(\varphi
\rightarrow GP\varphi\) </span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(HF)</span> <span class="sen">\(\varphi
\rightarrow HF\varphi\) </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
The first two axiom schemata are the temporal correspondents of the
so-called <em>K-axiom</em> of modal logic, and hence the terminology
\(\mathbf{K}_{t}\). The third and the fourth axiom schemata capture
the interaction of the past and future operators. On the formal level,
they guarantee that these operators correspond to converse temporal
relations, viz. earlier and later, respectively.</p>

<p>
The inference rules comprise, in addition to the classical <em>modus
ponens</em>, two <em>necessitation rules</em> for the temporal
operators (where \(\vdash\) means, as usual,
&ldquo;deducible&rdquo;):</p>

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">(MP)</span> <span class="sen">If \(\vdash

<h3><a id="ExpTemProTLExtMat">3.6 Expressing temporal properties in TL and extensions of \(\mathbf{K}_{t}\)</a></h3>

<p>
The minimal temporal logic \(\mathbf{K}_{t}\) captures those
validities of TL that do not depend on any specific assumptions
concerning the properties of the temporal precedence relation. Yet,
many natural properties of temporal frames can be expressed by
temporal formulae, and, taken as additional axioms, these formulae can
be used to represent important ontological assumptions about the
structure of time.</p>

<p>
A temporal formula of TL <em>expresses</em> (<em>defines</em> or
<em>corresponds to</em>) a property of temporal frames if the formula
is valid in all and only those frames that have the property. The most
important correspondences between properties of temporal frames (see
list in

 and TL formulae include: </p>

<p>
The principle (LIN) combines forward-linearity (LIN-F) and
backward-linearity (LIN-P) in a single condition. The resulting
formula is, however, not sufficient to guarantee the connectedness of
the temporal order. In other words, it cannot rule out disjoint linear
time lines. It is also worthwhile to note that (IND\(_{G}\)) implies
backward-discreteness and that (IND\(_{H}\)) implies forward-discreteness
but not conversely. For instance, a time flow consisting of a copy of
the natural numbers followed by a copy of the integers is
backward-discrete, but it does not satisfy (IND\(_{G}\)).</p>

<p>
Recall that the last three properties mentioned above &mdash;
Dedekind completeness, well-ordering, and the finite interval property &mdash;
are not definable by first-order sentences, but they can be expressed
by temporal formulae. On the other hand, some very simple properties
of temporal frames that are first-order definable, such as
irreflexivity or anti-symmetry, are not expressible in TL. For more on
temporal axioms expressing properties of time and details on such
results, see Segerberg (1970); Rescher and Urquhart (1971); Burgess
(1979); van Benthem (1983; 1995); Goldblatt (1992); and Hodkinson and
Reynolds (2006).</p>

<p>
By extending the list of axioms of \(\mathbf{K}_{t}\) with one or
several of the above principles one can capture the validities of a
number of natural models of time; that is, there are axiomatic
extensions that are sound and complete for the corresponding classes
of temporal frames. Some of these extensions were already being
studied in the early days of Temporal Logic, and Prior (1967)
discusses various systems obtained by postulating different
combination of axioms.</p> 

\[\begin{align}
\mathbf{K4}_{t} &amp;= \mathbf{K}_{t} + \text{(TRAN): all transitive frames.} \\
\mathbf{S4}_{t} &amp;= \mathbf{K}_{t} + \text{(REF) + (TRAN): all partial orderings.} \\
\mathbf{L}_{t} &amp;=\mathbf{K}_{t} + \text{(TRAN) +(LIN): all strict linear orderings.} \\
\mathbf{N}_{t} &amp;=\mathbf{L}_{t} + \text{(NOEND) + (IND\(_{G}\)) +
  (WELLORD): } \langle \mathbf{N,\lt}\rangle. \\
\mathbf{Z}_{t} &amp;=\mathbf{L}_{t} + \text{(NOBEG) + (NOEND) +
  (IND\(_{G}\)) + (IND\(_{H}\)): } \langle \mathbf{Z,\lt}\rangle. \\
\mathbf{Q}_{t} &amp;=\mathbf{L}_{t} + \text{(NOBEG) + (NOEND) +
  (DENSE): } \left\langle \mathbf{Q, \lt}\right\rangle. \\
\mathbf{R}_{t} &amp;=\mathbf{L}_{t} + \text{(NOBEG) + (NOEND) +
  (DENSE) + (COMPL): } \left\langle \mathbf{R, \lt}\right\rangle.
\end{align}\]

<p>
As these axiomatizations illustrate, the fact that (LIN) does not
suffice to guarantee connectedness in the strict sense or the fact
that irreflexivity is not definable in TL do not constitute any severe
limitations here: connectedness and irreflexivity do not yield any new
validities.</p>

<p>
Each of the above logics turns out <em>decidable</em> (i.e. has a
decidable set of validities), which is typically shown by proving the
so-called <em>finite model property</em> (&ldquo;Every satisfiable
formula is satisfiable in a finite model&rdquo;), in most cases, with
respect to non-standard finite models. For detailed proofs of
completeness of variations of these axiomatic systems as well as
proofs of decidability, see Segerberg (1970); Rescher and Urquhart
(1971); Burgess (1979); Burgess and Gurevich (1985); Goldblatt (1992);
and Gabbay et al. (1994).</p>

<h2><a id="ExtTLOveLinTimFlo">4. Extensions of TL over linear time</a></h2>

<p>
A very natural class of instant-based models of time is the class of
linear models, and soon after Prior&rsquo;s invention of Tense Logic
several extensions of TL over linear time have been proposed. In this
section, we discuss two such extensions of Prior&rsquo;s basic
temporal logic: the extension of TL by a <em>Next Time</em> operator
over discrete, linear models of time and the introduction of the
operators <em>Since</em> and <em>Until</em>. These operators also form
the basis of the linear time temporal logic LTL, which has widespread
applications in computer science.</p>

<h3><a id="AddNexTimOpe">4.1 Adding the <em>Next Time</em> operator</a></h3>

<p>
In linear, unbounded, forward-discrete temporal models \(\mathcal{M}=
\left\langle T,\prec, V \right\rangle,\) where every instant \(t\) has
a unique immediate successor \(s(t),\) it is natural to add a new
temporal operator \(X\) (&ldquo;<em>NeXt Time</em>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;<em>Tomorrow</em>&rdquo;) with
 semantics:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 

\[
 \mathcal{M},t \models X\varphi \text{ iff } \mathcal{M},s(t) \models \varphi.
\]

<p>
That is, \(X\varphi\) is true at a time instant \(t\) iff \(\varphi\)
is true at the immediate successor \(s(t)\) of \(t\). The <em>Next
Time</em> operator was already mentioned by Prior (1967, Chapter
IV.3), but its importance was first fully appreciated in the context
of LTL.</p>

<p>
The operator \(X\) satisfies the K-axiom</p>

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">(K\(_{X}\))</span> <span class="sen">\(X(\varphi
\to \psi) \to (X\varphi \to X\psi);\) </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
and the functionality axiom</p>

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">(FUNC)</span> <span class="sen">\(X\lnot \varphi
\leftrightarrow \lnot X\varphi.\) </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
It also enables a recursive, fixed point definition of \(G\)
(FP\(_G\)), and, on the ordering of the natural numbers, the operators
\(X\) and \(G\) satisfy an induction principle (IND). Assuming that
the temporal precedence relation \(\prec\) is reflexive, which is a
standard assumption in computer science, we get the following
definitions:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">(FP\(_G\))</span> <span class="sen">\(G\varphi
\leftrightarrow (\varphi \wedge XG\varphi);\) </span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(IND)</span> <span class="sen">\(\varphi \wedge
G(\varphi \rightarrow X\varphi )\rightarrow G\varphi.\) </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
In the language with \(G,H,\) and \(X\):</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\mathbf{L}_{t}(X) = \mathbf{L}_{t}\) + K\(_{X}\) + FUNC + FP\(_{G}\)
<br />
axiomatizes completely the temporal logic of linear, unbounded,
forward-discrete orderings, while </p>

<p class="indent">
\(\mathbf{N}_{t}(X) = \mathbf{N}_{t}\) + K\(_{X}\) + FUNC + FP\(_{G}
\) + IND
<br />
axiomatizes completely the temporal logic of \(\left\langle
\mathbf{N},s,\leq \right\rangle,\) where \(s(n) = n+1.\)</p>

<p>
A past analogue of \(X\), usually denoted \(Y\)
(&ldquo;<em>Yesterday</em>&rdquo;), can be defined and axiomatized
likewise. For more detail, see Goldblatt (1992) and Andr&eacute;ka et
al. (1995).</p>

<h3><a id="AddSinUnt">4.2 Adding <em>Since</em> and <em>Until</em></a></h3>

<p>
Perhaps the most important extension of Prior&rsquo;s basic tense
logic TL was the introduction of the binary temporal operators \(S\)
(&ldquo;<em>Since</em>&rdquo;) and \(U\)
(&ldquo;<em>Until</em>&rdquo;) by Hans Kamp in his doctoral
dissertation (Kamp 1968). The intuitive meanings of these
 are<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></p>
 
<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">\(\varphi S\psi\)</span> <span class="sen">&ldquo;\(\varphi\)
has been the case since a time when
\(\psi\) was the case.&rdquo; </span></li>

<li><span class="tag">\(\varphi U\psi\)</span> <span class="sen">&ldquo;\(\varphi\)
will be the case until a time when
\(\psi\) is the case.&rdquo; </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
For instance, the sentence &ldquo;I will keep trying until I
succeed&rdquo; can be formalized as: \(\mathsf{try}\,
U\,\mathsf{succeed}.\) As another example, &ldquo;Ever since Mia left
home, Joe has been unhappy and has been drinking until losing
consciousness&rdquo; can be formalized using <em>Since</em> and
<em>Until</em> as:</p> 

\[ 
(\mathsf{Joe\ unhappy} \land (\mathsf{Joe\ drinks}\ U\ \lnot(\mathsf{Joe\
conscious})))\ S\ (\mathsf{Mia\ leaves}).
\]

<p>
The formal semantics of \(S\) and \(U\) in a temporal model
\(\mathcal{M} = \langle M,\prec,V\rangle\) is given by the following
two clauses:</p> 

\[\begin{array}{ll} \mathcal{M},t\vDash \varphi S\psi\quad \text{ iff }
&amp;\mathcal{M},s\vDash \psi \text{ for some } s \text{ such that }
s\prec t \\ &amp; \text{ and } \mathcal{M},u\vDash \varphi \text{
for every } u \text{ such that } s\prec u\prec t;  \\

\mathcal{M},t\vDash \varphi U\psi \quad \text{ iff }
&amp;\mathcal{M},s\vDash \psi \text{ for some } s \text{ such that } 
t\prec s \\ &amp; \text{ and } \mathcal{M},u\vDash \varphi
\text{ for every } u \text{ such that } t\prec u\prec s.
\end{array}\]

<p>
These are the &lsquo;strict&rsquo; versions of \(S\) and \(U\)
prevalent in philosophy. In computer science, usually reflexive
versions of the semantics clauses are considered.</p>

<p>
Prior&rsquo;s temporal operators \(P\) and \(F\) are definable in
terms of \(S\) and \(U\):</p> 

\[
P\varphi :=\top S\varphi \ \text{ and } \ F\varphi :=\top
U\varphi.
\]

<p>
On irreflexive, forward-discrete, linear temporal orders, \(S\) and
\(U\) also allow for a definition of the <em>Next Time</em> operator
\(X\):</p> 

\[
X\varphi := \bot U \varphi.
\]

<p>
Note that this definition fails on reflexive temporal orders, which
shows that the irreflexive versions of \(S\) and \(U\) are more
expressive than their reflexive
 counterparts.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 Other natural operators can be defined in terms of \(S\) and \(U\) as
well, such as for instance <em>Before</em>, given by \(\varphi B\psi
:=\lnot ((\lnot \varphi)U\psi)\) with intuitive reading &ldquo;If
\(\psi\) will be the case in the future, \(\varphi\) will occur before
\(\psi\)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Kamp (1968) proved the following remarkable result concerning the
expressive power of temporal languages with <em>Since</em> and
<em>Until</em>: </p>

<p class="indent">
<em>Every temporal operator on a class of continuous, strict linear
orderings that is definable in first-order logic is expressible in
terms of \(S\) and \(U\)</em>.</p>

<p>
Stavi later proposed two more operators, \(S^{\prime}\) and
\(U^{\prime},\) which, when added to \(S\) and \(U\), make the
temporal language expressively complete on <em>all linear frames</em>.
Yet, as shown by Gabbay, no finite number of new operators can make
the temporal language functionally complete on all <em>partial</em>
orderings. See Gabbay et al. (1994) for an overview of these
results.</p>

<p>
Burgess (1982a) provided a complete axiomatic system of the
Since-Until logic on the class of all linear orderings with reflexive
precedence relation, which was further simplified by Xu (1988).
Extensions of this axiomatization for strict linear orderings were
obtained by Venema (1993) and Reynolds (1994; 1996). For details and
related results see Burgess (1984); Zanardo (1991); Gabbay et al. (1994); Finger et
al. (2002); and Hodkinson and Reynolds (2006). The Burgess-Xu
axiomatic system and some of its extensions are presented 
in the supplementary document:</p>

</blockquote>


<h3><a id="LinTimTemLogLTL">4.3 The linear time temporal logic LTL</a></h3>

<p>
The most popular and widely used temporal logic in computer science is
the linear time temporal logic LTL, which was proposed in the seminal
paper Pnueli (1977), and it was first explicitly axiomatized and
studied in Gabbay et al. (1980). In LTL, time is conceived of as a
linear, discrete succession of time instants, and the language
involves the operators \(G,\) \(X\), and \(U\) (no past operators).
LTL is interpreted over \(\left\langle \mathbf{N},\leq\right\rangle,\)
where the temporal ordering is assumed to be reflexive as is common in
computer science.</p>

<p>
The logic LTL is very useful for expressing properties of infinite
computations in reactive systems, such as safety, liveness, and
fairness, as laid out in
 <a href="#TemLogComSci">Section 11.1</a>.
 For example, the specification &ldquo;Every time when a message is
sent, an acknowledgment of receipt will eventually be returned, and
the message will not be marked &lsquo;sent&rsquo; before an
acknowledgment of receipt is returned&rdquo; can be formalized in LTL
as:</p> 

\[
 G(\mathsf{Sent} \to (\lnot \mathsf{MarkedSent} \ U\ \mathsf{AckReturned})).
\]

<p>
The axiomatic system for LTL extends classical propositional logic by
the K-axiom for \(G\), the K-axiom and the functionality axioms for
\(X\), as well as by axioms providing fixed point characterizations of
the reflexive versions of \(G\) and \(U\): </p>

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">(K\(_G\))</span> <span class="sen">\(G(\varphi
\rightarrow \psi)\rightarrow (G\varphi \rightarrow G\psi)\)
</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(K\(_X\))</span> <span class="sen">\(X(\varphi
\rightarrow \psi)\rightarrow (X\varphi \rightarrow X\psi)\)
</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(FUNC)</span> <span class="sen">\(X\lnot \varphi
\leftrightarrow \lnot X\varphi\) </span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(FP\(_G\))</span> <span class="sen">\(G\varphi
\leftrightarrow (\varphi \wedge XG\varphi)\) </span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(GFP\(_G\))</span> <span class="sen">\(\psi
\land G(\psi \rightarrow (\varphi \land X\psi)) \rightarrow G\varphi\)
</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(FP\(_U\))</span> <span class="sen">\(\varphi
U\psi \leftrightarrow (\psi \vee (\varphi \wedge X(\varphi U\psi)))\)
</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(LFP\(_U\))</span> <span class="sen">\(G((\psi
\vee (\varphi \wedge X\theta))\rightarrow \theta)\rightarrow (\varphi
U\psi \rightarrow \theta)\) </span></li>
</ul>

<p>
The inference rules involve only the classical <em>modus ponens</em>
and the necessitation rule for \(G\). In technical terms, the axiom
(FP\(_{G}\)) says that \(G\varphi\) is a <em>fixed point</em> of the
operator \(\Gamma_{G}\) defined by \(\Gamma_{G} (\theta) = \varphi
\land X\theta,\) whereas (GFP\(_{G}\)) says that \(G\varphi\) is
(set-theoretically, in terms of its extensions) a <em>greatest
post-fixed point</em> of \(\Gamma_{G}.\) Likewise, the axiom
(FP\(_{U}\)) says that \(\varphi U\psi\) is a <em>fixed point</em> of
the operator \(\Gamma_{U}\) defined by \(\Gamma_{U}(\theta) = \psi
\lor (\varphi \land X\theta),\) whereas (LFP\(_{U}\)) says that
\(\varphi U\psi\) is a <em>least pre-fixed point</em> of
\(\Gamma_{U}\). Some variations of this axiomatic system are 
presented in the supplementary document:</p>

 <blockquote>
 <a href="axiomatic-ltl.html">Some Variations of the Axiomatic System for LTL</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
Early studies of temporal logics for linear time are presented in
Rescher and Urquhart (1971) and McArthur (1976). Proofs of
completeness of variations of the axiomatic system given above can be
found in Gabbay et al. (1980; 1994); Goldblatt (1992); and Finger et
al. (2002). All logics mentioned in this section have the finite model
property (usually, with respect to non-standard models) and therefore
are decidable. For proofs of decidability, see the references on
completeness.</p>



<h2><a id="BraTimTemLog">5. Branching time temporal logics</a></h2>

<p>
Much of Prior&rsquo;s work on Tense Logic was initially motivated by
the problems concerning the relationship between time and modality
raised by the Master Argument of Diodorus Chronus and its fatalistic
conclusion. Prior held a genuine interest in themes like indeterminism
and the open future. One of his major concerns here was to allow for
human freedom. In order to capture the notion of historical necessity
underlying Diodorus&rsquo; argument, he opted for a branching
representation of the interrelation of time and modality, which was
first suggested to him in a letter by Kripke in 1958 (see Ploug and
&Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m 2012). The Diodorean conception of modality as
quantification over linear time was abandoned and replaced by the
picture of a tree, whose branches depict alternative possibilities for
the future. Prior (1967, Chapter 7) considered two different versions
of branching time temporal logic, which he associated with the
historical views of Peirce and Ockham, respectively. An early formal
treatment of these ideas is provided in Thomason (1970; 1984) and
Burgess (1978). Many technical results and further developments have
been proposed since then, and we mention the most important ones
below. For Prior&rsquo;s motivational views on indeterminism and human
freedom, see &Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m and Hasle (1995, Chapters 2.6 and
3.2) and &Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m (2019). A detailed discussion of the
philosophical aspects of the theory of branching time is contained in
e.g. Belnap et al. (2001) and Correia and Iacona (2013).</p>

<h3><a id="PriBraTimLogHisNec">5.1 Prior&rsquo;s theory of branching time</a></h3>

<p>
The picture that is at the core of Prior&rsquo;s theory of branching
time is reminiscent of the one evoked by Borges&rsquo; <em>The Garden
of Forking Paths</em>. The interrelation of time and modality is
represented as a tree of alternative histories that is linear towards
the past and branches into multiple possible futures.
Backward-linearity captures the idea that the past is fixed;
forward-branching reflects the openness of the future. At each point
in time, there may be more than one path leading towards the future,
and each such path represents a future possibility.</p>

<p>
Formally, a <em>tree</em> (or <em>branching time structure</em>) is a
temporal frame \(\mathcal{T} = \left\langle T, \prec \right\rangle\)
where the temporal precedence relation \(\prec\) is a backward-linear
partial ordering on the set of time instants \(T\) which is such that
any two instants have a common \(\prec\)-predecessor in \(T\). That
is, every time instant in a tree has a linearly ordered set of
\(\prec\)-predecessors, and any two instants share some common past. The
former condition rules out backward-branching, while the latter
ensures &lsquo;historical connectedness&rsquo;. In the philosophical
literature, the temporal precedence relation \(\prec\) is commonly
assumed to be irreflexive, i.e. a strict partial order, whereas in
computer science, usually reflexive structures are studied.</p>

<p>
A tree \(\mathcal{T} = \left\langle T, \prec \right\rangle\) depicts
alternative, mutually incompatible possibilities for the future in a
unified structure, and it can be carved up into multiple histories. A
<em>history</em> in \(\mathcal{T}\) is a maximal (i.e. non-extendable)
set of time instants that is linearly ordered by \(\prec\), that is,
an entire path through the tree; and it represents a complete possible
course of events. We denote the set of all histories in
\(\mathcal{T}\) by \(\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{T})\), and we use
\(\mathcal{H}(t)\) for the set of histories passing through a given
time instant \(t\) in \(\mathcal{T}\). </p>

<p>
Some philosophers have criticized the label &lsquo;branching
time&rsquo; as a misnomer, arguing that time does not branch but
rather evolves linearly. Early criticism along these lines is found in
Rescher and Urquhart (1971), and a similar point is raised in Belnap
et al. (2001), who suggest the label &lsquo;branching histories&rsquo;
instead. This criticism also casts doubt on the appropriateness of the
terminology &lsquo;time instants&rsquo; used here to refer to the
primitive points of the tree. We stick to the terminology for reasons
of uniformity. In the branching time literature, the more neutral
expression &lsquo;moments&rsquo; is prevailing, and in Belnap et al.
(2001) the distinction between instants of time and moments is
formally worked out: branching time structures are associated with a
linearly ordered set of time instants, where an instant is defined as
the set of contemporaneous moments contained in different
histories.</p>

<h3><a id="PeiTemLog">5.2 The Peircean branching time temporal logic</a></h3>

<p>
Prior&rsquo;s basic tense logic TL is neutral about the structure of
time. In a branching time setting with alternative future
possibilities, the original semantics of the future operator \(F\) is,
however, no longer adequate to capture future truth. In such a
setting, the future operator \(F\) merely reads &ldquo;it will
possibly be the case that \(\dots\)&rdquo;. Prior (1967, Chapter 7)
therefore considered two alternative semantics for the future operator
in branching time, which give rise to the Peircean and Ockhamist
branching time temporal logics, respectively.</p>

<p>
In the Peircean branching time logic PBTL, the intuitive meaning of
the future operator \(F\) is &ldquo;it will necessarily be the case
that \(\dots\)&rdquo;. That is, future truth is conceived of as truth
in <em>all</em> possible futures. On this new reading, the future
operator \(F\) is no longer dual to the strong future operator \(G\),
which now needs to be included as an additional primitive operator
into the language. Given a set of atomic propositions \({PROP}\), the
set of formulae of PBTL can be recursively defined as follows:</p>

\[
\varphi := p \in {PROP}\mid \bot \mid \neg \varphi\mid (\varphi \wedge \varphi) \mid P \varphi \mid F\varphi \mid G \varphi. 
\]

<p>
Formulae of PBTL are evaluated in a temporal model \(\mathcal{M} =
\langle T,\prec,V\rangle\) on a tree \(\mathcal{T} = \langle
T,\prec\rangle\), called a <em>Peircean tree model</em>. As usual,
\(V\) is a valuation that assigns to every atomic proposition \(p \in
{PROP}\) the set of time instants \(V(p) \subseteq T\) at which \(p\)
is considered true, and the <em>truth of an arbitrary formula
\(\varphi\) of PBTL at a given time instant \(t\) in a Peircean tree
model \(\mathcal{M}\)</em> is defined inductively. The semantic
clauses for the truth-functional connectives and for the past operator
\(P\) (and its dual \(H\)) are as in TL (see
 <a href="#SemTL">Section 3.2</a>),
 and we only provide here the semantic clauses for the future
operators \(F\) and \(G\):</p> 

\[\begin{array}{ll} \mathcal{M},t\vDash F\varphi \quad \text{ iff }
&amp; \text{for all histories } h\in \mathcal{H}(t)\text{, there is some time }  \\ &amp; \text{instant } t'\in h \text{ such that } t\prec t' \text{ and } \mathcal{M},t'\vDash \varphi;  \\

\mathcal{M},t\vDash G\varphi \quad \text{ iff }
&amp; \text{for all histories } h\in \mathcal{H}(t) \text{ and for all time instants } \\ &amp; t'\in h \text{ such that } t\prec t', \mathcal{M},t'\vDash \varphi.
\end{array}\]

<p>
Thus, according to the Peircean semantics, a formula of the form
\(F\varphi\) is true at an instant \(t\) iff every history passing
through \(t\) contains some later instant \(t'\) at which \(\varphi\)
is true. The strong future operator \(G\) essentially retains its
original semantics but now reads &ldquo;it will necessarily always be
the case that \(\dots\)&rdquo;. Note that in this case the universal
quantification over histories is redundant and can be omitted without
loss of meaning. The dual of \(G\) is the weak future operator of TL,
which is now denoted by \(f\), while the dual of the Peircean \(F\) is
commonly written \(g\) (cf. Burgess 1980). All future operators
involve (implicitly or explicitly) quantification over histories and
are modalized: they capture possibility and necessity regarding the
future. There is no actual future and, accordingly, no notion of plain
future truth. As this accords well with the view held by Peirce, Prior
called this system &lsquo;Peircean&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Note that in the Peircean temporal logic, the formula \(\varphi
\rightarrow HF\varphi\) is no longer valid, which blocks the Master
Argument of Diodorus Chronus: what is the case now need not have been
necessary in the past. Moreover, while Peirceanism preserves bivalence
and the principle of excluded middle \(\varphi \vee \neg\varphi\), it
renders all formulae expressing future contingents false and hence
invalidates the principle of future excluded middle \(F\varphi \vee
F\neg\varphi\). This principle states that eventually either
\(\varphi\) or \(\neg\varphi\) will be the case and is usually judged
intuitively valid (see e.g. Thomason 1970).</p>

<p>
A complete finite axiomatization of the Peircean branching time temporal logic
was given by Burgess (1980), using a version of the so-called Gabbay
Irreflexivity Rule. Zanardo (1990) provides an alternative
axiomatization, where the Gabbay Irreflexivity Rule is replaced by an
infinite list of axioms.</p>

<h3><a id="OckTemLog">5.3 The Ockhamist branching time temporal logic</a></h3>

<p>
While Prior himself favored Peirceanism, the Ockhamist branching time
temporal logic, which he developed as a possible alternative, has been
gaining much more influence in the literature on branching time. In
the Ockhamist branching time logic OBTL, truth is not only relativized
to a time instant in the tree but also to a history passing through
that instant, and the future operator \(F\) is now evaluated along the
given history. Thus, the intuitive meaning of \(F\) becomes
&ldquo;<em>With respect to the given history</em>, it will be the case
that \(\dots\)&rdquo;. In addition to the temporal operators \(F\) and
\(P\), the language of OBTL contains a modal operator \(\Diamond\) and
its dual \(\Box\), which are interpreted as quantifiers over
histories. Given a set of atomic propositions \({PROP}\), the set of
formulae of OBTL can be recursively defined by</p> 

\[
\varphi := p \in {PROP}\mid \bot \mid \neg \varphi\mid (\varphi \wedge \varphi) \mid P\varphi \mid F\varphi \mid \Diamond\varphi. 
\]

<p>
In the Ockhamist semantics, formulae are interpreted in a model on a
tree \(\mathcal{T} = \langle T,\prec\rangle\) at pairs \((t,h)\)
consisting of a time instant \(t\in T\) and a history \(h \in
\mathcal{H}(t)\) containing that instant. Sometimes the
instant-history pairs \((t,h)\) are conceived of as &lsquo;initial
branches&rsquo; that start at the instant \(t\) and span the possible
future specified by the history \(h\) (see e.g. Zanardo 1996).</p>

<p>
Naturally, the question arises how to evaluate the atomic propositions
in the model: do the truth values of atomic propositions depend only
on the time instant, or do they depend on the history as well? The
answer to this question crucially hinges on whether atomic
propositions may contain &lsquo;traces of futurity&rsquo; or not
(Prior 1967, 124). There is no consensus on the treatment of atomic
propositions in the literature (cf. Zanardo 1996), and Prior himself
entertained the idea of a two-sorted language with two different kinds
of atomic propositions that each require a different treatment (Prior
1967, Chapter 7.4). Here we will allow the truth values of atomic
propositions to depend on both the time instant and the history. The
more specific case of instant-based propositions can be obtained by
imposing the additional requirement that the formula \(p
\leftrightarrow \Box p\) be valid for \(p \in {PROP}\).</p>

<p>
Thus, an <em>Ockhamist tree model</em> is a triple \(\mathcal{M} =
\left\langle T, \prec, V \right\rangle\) where \(\mathcal{T} = \langle
T,\prec\rangle\) is a tree and \(V\) is a valuation that assigns to
every atomic proposition \(p\in {PROP}\) the set of instant-history
pairs \(V(p) \subseteq T \times \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{T})\) at which
\(p\) is considered true. The <em>truth of an arbitrary formula
\(\varphi\) of OBTL at an instant-history pair \((t,h)\) in an
Ockhamist tree model \(\mathcal{M}\)</em> is defined inductively as
follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t,h\vDash p\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp; \((t,h)\in V(p)\), for \(p\in
{PROP}\); </li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t,h\not\vDash \bot\); </li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t,h \vDash \neg\varphi\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp; \(\mathcal{M},t,h
\not\vDash \varphi\); </li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t,h \vDash \varphi \wedge \psi\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp;
\(\mathcal{M},t,h \models \varphi\) and \(\mathcal{M},t,h \vDash
\psi\); </li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t,h\vDash P\varphi\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp; \(\mathcal{M},t',h\vDash
\varphi\) for some time instant \(t'\in h\) such that \(t' \prec t\);
</li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t,h\vDash F\phi\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp; \(\mathcal{M},t',h\models
\phi\) for some time instant \(t'\in h\) such that \(t \prec t'\);
</li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},t,h\vDash \Diamond \varphi\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp;
\(\mathcal{M},t,h'\vDash \varphi\) for some history \(h'\in
\mathcal{H}(t)\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
The temporal operators are essentially interpreted as they are in
linear temporal logic: the instant of evaluation is simply shifted
backwards and forwards on the given history. Note that the requirement
&ldquo;\(t'\in h\)&rdquo; is redundant in the semantic clause for the
past operator \(P\) as there is no backward branching. It is crucial,
however, in the clause for the future operator \(F\). As usual, the
strong temporal operators \(H\) and \(G\) are defined as the duals of
\(P\) and \(F\), respectively. The modal operators quantify over the
set of histories passing through the current instant. The operator
\(\Diamond\) is an existential quantifier over that set and captures
possibility, while its dual \(\Box\) involves universal quantification
and expresses &lsquo;inevitability&rsquo; or &lsquo;historical
necessity&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
We say that a formula of OBTL is <em>Ockhamist valid</em> iff it is
true at all instant-history pairs in all Ockhamist tree models.
Obviously, all temporal formulae that are valid in linear models of
time are Ockhamist valid as well. Hence, Ockhamism validates the principle of
future excluded middle \(F\varphi \vee F \neg\varphi\) (under the
assumption that time does not end) as well as the formula \(\varphi
\rightarrow HF\varphi\). It invalidates, however, the principle of the
necessity of the past \(P\varphi \rightarrow \Box P\varphi\), and it
thereby blocks Diodorus&rsquo; Master Argument. </p>

<p>
Whereas in the Peircean branching time logic PBTL future truth is
modalized, in the Ockhamist branching time logic OBTL future truth and
modality come apart. The Peircean formulae \(F\varphi\) and
\(G\varphi\) are equivalent to the Ockhamist \(\Box F\varphi\) and
\(\Box G\varphi\), respectively. In fact, PBTL can be regarded as a
proper fragment of OBTL, namely the fragment that comprises all and
only those formulae that are recursively built up from (instant-based)
atomic propositions using truth-functional connectives and the
combined modalities \(\Box F\), \(\Box G\), and their duals \(\Diamond
F\) and \(\Diamond G\). However, the Peircean language is less
expressive than the Ockhamist one, lacking e.g. an equivalent for
\(\Diamond GF\varphi\) (for a proof, see Reynolds 2002).</p>

<p>
By relativizing truth at an instant to a history in the tree, the
Ockhamist branching time logic provides a notion of plain future
truth. From a philosophical point of view, however, the relativization
to a history is not entirely unproblematic. There are essentially two
different ways to interpret the Ockhamist history parameter: first,
one may think of the history parameter as referring to the actual
course of events in the tree of possibilities and, since this idea
meshes well with Ockham&rsquo;s view on the future, Prior chose the
label &lsquo;Ockhamism&rsquo;. The actualist position has triggered a
variety of branching time temporal logics, which are often summarized under the
label &lsquo;Thin Red Line&rsquo; theories (for a discussion, see
Belnap and Green 1994; Belnap et al. 2001; and &Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m
2009). Second, one may think of the history parameter as an auxiliary
parameter of truth that cannot be initialized in a context: a context of utterance, one may argue, uniquely determines the time instant of the utterance, but it does not and cannot single out one of the histories passing through that instant if the future is genuinely open. This line
of thought has given rise to &lsquo;post-semantic&rsquo; accounts,
which aim to bridge the gap between the recursive semantic machinery
and a context by introducing a notion of <em>super-truth</em>, most
notably Thomason&rsquo;s supervaluationism (Thomason 1970) and
MacFarlane&rsquo;s assessment-sensitive post-semantics (MacFarlane
2003; 2014). These accounts sacrifice bivalence, but they preserve the
principles of excluded middle \(\varphi \vee \neg\varphi\) and
future excluded middle \(F\varphi \vee F\neg\varphi\).</p>

<p>
From a logical point of view, the Ockhamist approach to branching time
bears a strong resemblance to the idea underlying the notion of a
<em>\(T\times W\) frame</em> and the more general notion of a <em>Kamp
frame</em>, discussed in Thomason (1984); the latter is technically
equivalent to the notion of an <em>Ockhamist frame</em> introduced in
Zanardo (1996). These kinds of frames build on a set of distinct
possible worlds, each of which is endowed with an internal linear
temporal structural, and assume a time-relative, historical
accessibility relation between possible worlds. That is, overlap of
histories is replaced by accessibility, and possible worlds are
considered primitive elements whereas in branching time histories are
defined in terms of instants. As a consequence, if we merge a frame
consisting of historically related possible worlds into a single tree
(replacing accessibility by identity), new histories may emerge that
do not correspond to any of the possible worlds (for the construction,
see e.g. Reynolds 2002).</p>

<p>
Technically, the difference between a possible worlds based approach
and a branching time based approach can be overcome by equipping
branching time structures with a primitive set of histories that is
rich enough to cover the entire structure, a so-called
<em>bundle</em>. A <em>bundle tree</em> is defined as a triple
\(\langle T,\prec,\mathcal{B}\rangle\) where \(\mathcal{T} = \langle
T,\prec\rangle\) is a tree and the bundle \(\mathcal{B} \subseteq
\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{T})\) is a non-empty set of histories such that
every instant in \(\mathcal{T}\) belongs to some history in
\(\mathcal{B}\) (Burgess 1978; 1980). The Ockhamist branching time
logic straightforwardly generalizes to bundled trees: the sole
difference is that the semantics is now restricted to histories from
the bundle. Bundled tree validity is equivalent to Kamp validity
(Zanardo 1996; Reynolds 2002), but it is weaker than full Ockhamist
validity. Reynolds (2002) provides the following example of a formula
that is Ockhamist valid but falsifiable in bundled trees (further
counterexamples were provided in e.g. Burgess 1978 and Nishimura
1979): 

\[\Box G(\Box p \to \Diamond F \Box p) \to \Diamond G(\Box p \to F \Box p).\]

 The antecedent of this formula intuitively allows
one to construct a &lsquo;limit history&rsquo; in which \(\Box p\)
always holds from an infinite bundle of different histories. Such
limit histories may be omitted in bundled trees, which gave rise to
philosophical discussions concerning the adequacy of those frames (see
e.g. Nishimura 1979; Thomason 1984; and Belnap et al. 2001).</p>

<p>
A complete axiomatization of bundled tree validity is given in Zanardo
(1985) and Reynolds (2002). Finding a complete axiomatization for
Ockhamist validity turned out more difficult. It has been shown that
the class of Ockhamist trees is not definable in the class of bundled
trees (Zanardo et al. 1999). In Reynolds (2003), a complete
axiomatization for Ockhamist validity is claimed and a proof sketched. In this system, the problem of emergent histories is dealt with by an
infinite axiom scheme that is based on the formula given above and is
supposed to guarantee the &lsquo;limit closure property&rsquo;. The
full proof, however, has not appeared yet. The proposed axiomatic system can be found in the supplementary document:</p>

<h3><a id="GenPeiOck">5.4 Extensions of Peirceanism and Ockhamism</a></h3>

<p>
Several extensions and variations of the Peircean and Ockhamist
branching time temporal logics have been proposed and studied over the past
years, including logics that unify both frameworks, and we will
briefly mention some of them here.</p>

<p>
Brown and Goranko (1999) propose an axiomatization of a logic that
combines Peircean and Ockhamist ideas. The language of the Ockhamist
branching time logic is extended by a modality for an
<em>alternative</em> branch, and a special kind of <em>fan
variables</em> is introduced to represent all histories passing
through one instant.</p>

<p>
The branching time logic with <em>indistinguishability functions</em>
developed in Zanardo (1998) unifies Peirceanism and Ockhamism. The
language extends the Peircean temporal logic by modal operators, and
formulae are evaluated on so-called <em>I-trees</em>, which are trees
\(\mathcal{T} = \langle T,\prec\rangle\) with an indistinguishability
function \(I\) that assigns to each time instant in \(\mathcal{T}\) a
partition of the set of histories passing through that instant.
Whereas in the Ockhamist semantics truth at an instant is relativized
to a history, in the semantics on I-trees truth at an instant is
relativized to an equivalence class modulo indistinguishability at
that instant, i.e. to a set of histories. Peirceanism and Ockhamism
correspond to the limiting cases where the partition is trivial, that
is, a singleton or a set of singletons, respectively. For details, see
Zanardo (1998), as well as Zanardo (2013) and Ciuni and Zanardo
(2010), where the idea is combined with elements of the <em>stit</em>
logic of agency.</p>

<p>
An account that is similar in spirit and likewise unifies Peirceanism
and Ockhamism is the <em>transition semantics</em> presented in
Rumberg (2016). The novel feature of this framework is that possible
courses of events are successively built up from local future
possibilities: they are viewed as possibly non-maximal,
downward-closed chains of transitions, where each transition specifies a possible direction at a branching point. Incomplete possible courses of events become available as well,
which can then be extended towards the future, and the language
contains, in addition to temporal and modal operators, a so-called
stability operator, which allows one to capture how the truth value of
a formula about the future at an instant changes in the course of
time. Peirceanism and Ockhamism result as limiting cases by
restricting the range of admissible courses of events to the empty set of transitions and
maximal chains, respectively. For details, see Rumberg (2016; 2019)
and Rumberg and Zanardo (2019). A brief overview is presented
in the supplementary document:</p>

<h3><a id="ComTreLogCTLCTL">5.5 The computation tree logics CTL and CTL*</a></h3>

<p>
Branching time logics are extensively used in computer science. The
most popular ones are the computation tree logics CTL and CTL*, which
are variations of the Peircean and Ockhamist branching time temporal
logics. They are interpreted on the class of so-called <em>computation
trees</em>, where every history has the order type of the natural
numbers. These trees are naturally obtained as tree unfoldings of
discrete transition systems and represent the possible infinite
computations arising in such systems. While CTL historically preceded
CTL*, nowadays CTL is often viewed as a fragment of CTL*, and we
follow this convention here. </p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li>The <em>full computation tree logic</em> CTL* is the computational
variant of Ockhamism, and it was introduced by Emerson and Halpern
(1985). The language of CTL* contains (the reflexive versions of) the
future operators \(G\) and \(U\) (<em>Until</em>) as well as the
<em>Next Time</em> operator \(X\) (no past operators), which are now
interpreted on computation trees. As in the general Ockhamist
branching time logic, the evaluation is relativized to both an instant
(here called <em>state</em>) and a history (here called
<em>path</em>). We note that in computer science usually instant-based
atomic propositions are assumed, i.e., the valuation of the atomic
propositions depends only on the state.</li>

<li>The <em>computation tree logic</em> CTL is the computational
variant of Peirceanism, and it was introduced by Emerson and Clarke
(1982). CTL is the fragment of CTL* where each of the temporal
operators \(G\), \(U\), and \(X\) is immediately preceded by a modal
operator, \(\Box\) or \(\Diamond\), here usually denoted as the path
quantifiers \(\forall\) and \(\exists\). That is, the language of CTL
is recursively built up using the combined modalities \(\forall
G\varphi\), \(\forall(\varphi U\psi)\), \(\forall X\varphi\) and
\(\exists G\varphi\), \(\exists(\varphi U\psi)\), \(\exists
X\varphi\). A precursor of CTL is the logic UB, introduced by Ben-Ari
et al. (1983), in which \(U\) does not occur. </li>
</ul>

<p>
The logic CTL became widely used owing to its good computational
properties with regard to <em>model checking</em>, having linear
complexity both in the size of the input formula and in the size of
the input model (as finite transition system). However, CTL is not
very expressive, which led to its extension CTL*. The logic CTL* is
expressively much more powerful and subsumes the linear time temporal logic
LTL, but it has higher complexities of model checking (PSPACE) and of
deciding satisfiability (2EXPTIME). For references and further
details, see Emerson (1990) and Stirling (1992).</p>


  

<p>
A complete axiomatization of CTL can be obtained by replacing the
axioms of LTL by their path-quantified versions. For proofs of
completeness, see Emerson (1990) and Goldblatt (1992). For CTL* more
axioms must be added to account for the combinations of temporal and
modal operators and to enforce the limit closure property of trees. A
complete axiomatization for CTL* was obtained by Reynolds (2001), and
a completeness result for the extension of CTL* with past operators is
established in Reynolds (2005). A sketch of the axiomatic system for
CTL can be found in the supplementary document:</p>
 

<blockquote>

<p>We note that the Peircean and Ockhamist branching time logics, as well
as their computational variants, have the finite model property and
are decidable. Proofs of decidability of the respective logics can be
found in e.g. Burgess (1980); Emerson and Sistla (1984); Gurevich and
Shelah (1985); Emerson and Halpern (1985); Emerson
(1990); Goldblatt (1992); Gabbay et al. (1994); Finger et al. (2002); and Demri et al.

<h2><a id="IntTemLog">6. Interval temporal logics</a></h2>

<p>
Instant-based and interval-based models of time are two different
kinds of temporal ontologies and, even though they are technically
reducible to each other, this does not solve the main semantic issue
arising when developing a logical formalism to capture temporal
reasoning: should propositions about time, and therefore formulae in
the given logical language, be interpreted as referring to time
instants or to intervals?</p>

<p>
There have been various proposals and developments of interval-based
temporal logics in the philosophical logic literature. Important early
contributions include Hamblin (1972); Humberstone (1979); R&ouml;per
(1980); and Burgess (1982b). The latter provides an axiomatization for
an interval-based temporal logic involving the temporal precedence
relation between intervals on the rationals and the reals. The
interval-based approach to temporal reasoning has been very prominent
in Artificial Intelligence. Some notable works here include
Allen&rsquo;s logic of planning (Allen 1984), Kowalski and
Sergot&rsquo;s calculus of events (Kowalski and Sergot 1986), and
Halpern and Shoham&rsquo;s modal interval logic (Halpern and Shoham
1986). But, it also features in some applications in computer science,
such as <em>real-time logics</em> and <em>hardware verification</em>,
notably Moszkowski&rsquo;s Interval Logic (Moszkowski 1983) and Zhou, Hoare, and
Ravn&rsquo;s Duration Calculus (see Hansen and Zhou 1997).</p>

<p>
Here we will briefly present the propositional modal interval logic
proposed by Halpern and Shoham (1986), hereafter called
\(\mathsf{HS}.\) The language of \(\mathsf{HS}\) includes a family of
unary interval operators of the form \(\langle X\rangle,\) one for
each of Allen&rsquo;s interval relations over linear time. The respective notations are listed in <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>
 (<a href="#IntBasModTim">Section 2.2</a>). Given a set of atomic propositions \(PROP\), formulae
are recusively defined by the following grammar: 

\[\varphi := p \in {PROP} \mid \bot \mid \neg \varphi \mid (\varphi \wedge \varphi) \mid \langle X\rangle\varphi.\]</p>

<p>
The interval logic \(\mathsf{HS}\) starts from instant-based models
over linear time, and intervals are considered defined elements. So
let \(\mathcal{T} = \langle T,\prec\rangle\) be a temporal frame and
assume that the temporal precedence relation \(\prec\) induces a
strict linear order on the set of time instants \(T\). An
<em>interval</em> in \(\mathcal{T}\) is defined as an ordered pair
\([a,b]\) such that \(a,b\in T\) and \(a\leq b.\) The set of all
intervals in \(\mathcal{T}\) is denoted by
\(\mathbb{I}(\mathcal{T)}.\) Note that the definition allows for
&lsquo;point intervals&rsquo; whose beginning and end points coincide,
following the original proposal by Halpern and Shoham (1986).
Sometimes, only &lsquo;strict&rsquo; intervals are considered,
excluding point-intervals.</p>

<p>
In interval-based temporal logic, formulae are evaluated relative to
time intervals rather than instants. An <em>interval model</em> is a
triple \(\mathcal{M} = \langle T,\prec,V\rangle\) consisting of a
temporal frame \(\mathcal{T} = \langle T,\prec\rangle\) and a
valuation \(V\) that assigns to each atomic proposition \(p\in{PROP}\)
the set of time intervals \(V(p) \subseteq
\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{I}(\mathcal{T}))\) at which \(p\) is considered
true. The <em>truth of an arbitrary formula \(\varphi\) with respect to a given
interval \([a,b]\) in an interval model \(\mathcal{M}\)</em> is
defined by structural induction on formulae as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},[a,b] \models p\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp; \([a,b]\in
V(p)\), for \(p \in {PROP};\)</li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},[a,b] \not\models \bot;\)</li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},[a,b] \models \neg\varphi\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp;
\(\mathcal{M},[a,b] \not\models \varphi;\)</li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},[a,b] \models \varphi \wedge \psi\) &nbsp; iff
&nbsp; \(\mathcal{M},[a,b] \models \varphi\) and \(\mathcal{M},[a,b]
\models \psi;\)</li>

<li>\(\mathcal{M},[a,b] \models \langle X\rangle\varphi\) &nbsp; iff
&nbsp; \(\mathcal{M},[c,d] \models \varphi\) for some interval
\([c,d]\) such that \([a,b]R_{X}[c,d]\), where \(R_X\) is
Allen&rsquo;s interval relation corresponding to the modal operator
\(\langle X\rangle\) (cf.
 <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>).
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
That is, the new interval operators are given a Kripke-style semantics
over the associated Allen relations. E.g., for the Allen relation
&ldquo;meets&rdquo;, we have:</p> 

\[
\mathcal{M},[t_{0},t_{1}] \models \langle A\rangle \varphi \text{ iff } \mathcal{M},[t_{1},t_{2}] \models \varphi \text{ for some interval } [t_{1},t_{2}].
\]

<p>
For each diamond modality \(\langle X\rangle,\) the corresponding box
modality is defined as its dual: \([X] \varphi \equiv \neg \langle
X\rangle \neg \varphi.\) Sometimes it is useful to include an
additional modal constant for point intervals, denoted \(\pi,\) with
the following truth definition:</p> 

\[
 \mathcal{M},[a,b]\models\pi \text{ iff } a=b.
\]

<p>
Some of the \(\mathsf{HS}\) modalities are definable in terms of
others, and for each of the strict and non-strict semantics, minimal
fragments that are expressive enough to define all other operators
have been identified. Complete sets of equivalences that allow one to
define certain \(\mathsf{HS}\) modalities in terms of others are
presented in the supplementary document:</p>

The logic \(\mathsf{HS}\) has over a thousand expressively
non-equivalent fragments involving only some of the modal operators,
which have been studied extensively (see Della Monica et al. 2011 for
a recent survey). \(\mathsf{HS}\) and most of its fragments are very
expressive, and the respective notions of validity are usually
undecidable (under some additional assumptions even highly
undecidable, viz. \(\Pi^{1}_{1}\)-complete). However, some quite
non-trivial decidable fragments of HS have been identified. Probably
the best studied one is the <em>neighborhood interval logic</em>,
which involves the operators \(\langle A \rangle\) and
\(\langle\overline{A}\rangle\) (Goranko et al. 2003). One specific
axiom for \(\langle A\rangle\) (and symmetrically for
\(\langle\overline{A}\rangle\)) is \(\langle A \rangle\langle A
\rangle\langle A \rangle p \to \langle A \rangle\langle A \rangle p,\)
saying that any two consecutive right-neighboring intervals can be
joined into one right-neighboring interval.</p>

<p>
In addition to the unary \(\mathsf{HS}\) interval modalities
associated with Allen&rsquo;s binary interval relations, there is a
natural and important operation of chopping an interval into two
subintervals, which gives rise to the ternary interval relation
&lsquo;chop&rsquo;, proposed and studied in Moszkowski (1983). The
framework was later extended in Venema (1991) to the logic CDT, which
involves next to &lsquo;chop&rsquo; (\(C\)), the two residual
&lsquo;chop&rsquo; operators \(D\) and \(T.\) The logic CDT was
completely axiomatized in Venema (1991); see also Goranko et al.
(2004) and Konur (2013).</p>

<p>
There is a natural spatial interpretation of interval temporal logics,
based on the idea that the pairs of points that define an interval on
a linear order \(L\) can be considered coordinates of a point in the
\(L \times L\)-plane. Relations between intervals are then interpreted
as spatial relations between the corresponding points. This
interpretation has been fruitfully explored to transfer various
technical results between spatial and interval logics, such as
undecidability, see e.g. Venema (1990) and Marx and Reynolds
(1999).</p>

<p>
Lastly, a few words about the relationship between interval temporal
logics and first-order logic. The standard translation of
Prior&rsquo;s basic tense logic TL into first-order logic (presented
in
 <a href="#StaTraTLFirOrdLog">Section 3.3</a>)
 extends naturally to interval logics, where atomic propositions are
represented in the first-order language by binary relations. It turns
out that some fragments of \(\mathsf{HS}\) can be translated into the
two-variable fragment FO\(^{2}\) of first-order logic, which
eventually implies their decidability. The expressively strongest such
interval logic is the neighborhood interval logic, which was proven to
be expressively complete for FO\(^{2}\) (Bresolin et al. 2009). Other
fragments of \(\mathsf{HS}\) require at least three distinct variables
for the standard translation. Still, even the full logic
\(\mathsf{HS}\) is less expressive than the three-variable fragment
FO\(^{3}\) of first-order logic, for which Venema (1991) showed that
the logic CDT is expressively complete.</p>

<h2><a id="OthVarTemLog">7. Other variants of temporal logics</a></h2>

<p>
So far we have discussed the traditional family of temporal logics,
but there are numerous variations and alternative developments that
provide useful formalisms for various applications. We briefly present
some of them here: hybrid temporal logics, metric and real-time
temporal logics, and quantified propositional logics.</p>

<h3><a id="HybTemLog">7.1 Hybrid temporal logics</a></h3>

<p>
A notable family of temporal logics, enriching the traditional
framework, are <em>hybrid temporal logics</em>, which combine
propositional temporal logic with elements of first-order logic and
thereby considerably increase the expressive power of the
language.</p>

<p>
The most prominent notion in hybrid temporal logics is that of a
<em>nominal</em>. Nominals are special atomic propositions in that
they are considered to be true at exactly one instant of the temporal
model. Hence, one can think of a nominal \(a\) as saying &ldquo;It is
\(a\) o&rsquo;clock now&rdquo;. For this reason, nominals are
sometimes also called &lsquo;clock variables&rsquo;. The idea of
nominals can be traced back to Prior (1967, Chapter V; 1968, Chapter
XI), who considered the possibility of identifying instants with
instant-propositions: an instant can be conceived of as the
conjunction of all those propositions that are true at that instant. A
first systematic treatment of hybrid temporal logic was given in Bull
(1970). In addition to nominals, hybrid languages are often augmented
by further syntactic mechanisms, such as a satisfaction operator,
nominal quantifiers, and reference pointers, which we briefly discuss
below. The former two mechanisms can already be found in Prior&rsquo;s
work (see Blackburn 2006) and were reinvented independently in Passy and Tinchev (1985). Reference pointers were introduced only much later
in Goranko (1996), and a similar referencing mechanism is found in
Alur and Henzinger (1994).</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li><em>Satisfaction operator</em>: The satisfaction operator
\(@_{i}\) allows one to express that a given formula is true in a
model at the time instant denoted by the nominal \(i\). That is,
\(\mathcal{M},t\vDash @_{i}\varphi\) iff \(\mathcal{M},V(i)\vDash
\varphi,\) where \( V(i)\) is the unique instant where \(i\) is true.
The notion of truth at an instant of a temporal model is imported into
the object-language.</li>

<li><em>Quantifiers over nominals</em>: By means of the nominal
quantifier \(\forall i\) one can express that a given formula is true
at a given time instant in a temporal model under each possible
assignment of time instants to \(i\). More formally,
\(\mathcal{M},t\vDash \forall i\varphi\) iff \(\mathcal{M}_{[i\rightarrow
s]},t\vDash \varphi\) for any instant \(s\) in \(\mathcal{M},\) where
\(\mathcal{M}_{[i\rightarrow s]}\) is the model obtained from
\(\mathcal{M}\) by re-assigning the denotation of \(i\) to be \(s.\)
The full power of first-order quantification is brought into the
temporal language, while many of its propositional virtues are
preserved.</li>

<li><em>Reference pointers</em>: Reference pointers \(\downarrow_{i}\)
are often also referred to as &lsquo;binders&rsquo;, for they bind the
value of the nominal \(i\) to the current instant of evaluation. A
formula \(\downarrow_{i}\varphi\) is true at a given instant \(t\) in
a temporal model iff \(\varphi\) is true at \(t\) whenever the nominal
\(i\) denotes \(t\). That is, \(\mathcal{M},t\vDash
\downarrow_{i}\varphi\) iff \(\mathcal{M}_{[i\rightarrow t]},t\vDash
\varphi\). Reference pointers provide a mechanism for referring to the
current time instant, i.e. saying &lsquo;now&rsquo;. For a systematic
logical treatment of &lsquo;now&rsquo;, see Kamp (1971).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other operators that can be considered hybrid temporal logic operators
are the <em>universal modality</em>, the <em>difference modality</em>, and <em>propositional
quantifiers</em>. The universal modality \(A\) says that a given
formula is true at every instant of the temporal modal and hence
captures the global notion of truth in a model: \(\mathcal{M},t\vDash
A\varphi\) iff \(\mathcal{M}\vDash\varphi\). The difference
modality \(D\), on the other hand, states that the given formula
is true at some other instant. Note that both modalities abstract away
from the underlying accessibility relation. Propositional
quantifiers \(\forall p\) introduce second-order quantification
into the propositional language, and we discuss them in
 <a href="#QuaProTemLog">Section 7.3</a>
 below.</p>

<p>
Hybrid languages are very expressive. Here are just two examples:</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li>Irreflexivity of the precedence relation, which is not expressible
in TL, can be expressed in a language with nominals and the
satisfaction operator \(@_i\) as \(@_{i}G\lnot i.\)</li>

<li>The operators \(S\) and \(U\) are definable in a language with
nominals and binders: \(\varphi U\psi :={\downarrow _{i}}F(\psi \wedge
H(Pi\rightarrow \varphi))\) and likewise for \(S.\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
While the weaker versions of hybrid logics &mdash; with nominals,
satisfaction operators, universal modality, and difference modality
&mdash; are still decidable, the more expressive ones &mdash; with
quantifiers over nominals or reference pointers &mdash; are usually
undecidable. For details, see Goranko (1996); and Areces and ten Cate
(2006).</p>

<p>
Branching time versions of hybrid temporal logics have been
investigated as well. For an overview of varieties of hybrid temporal
logics and their historical development, see Blackburn and Tzakova
(1999) and the entry on
 <a href="../logic-hybrid/index.html">hybrid logic</a>.</p>
 
<h3><a id="MetReaTimTemLog">7.2 Metric and real-time temporal logics</a></h3>

<p>
Metric temporal logics go back to Prior, too (see Prior 1967, Chapter
VI). He used the notation \(Pn\varphi\) for &ldquo;It was the case the
interval \(n\) ago that \(\varphi\)&rdquo; (i.e. \(\varphi\) was the
case \(n\) time units ago) and \(Fn\varphi\) for &ldquo;It will be the
case the interval \(n\) hence that \(\varphi\)&rdquo; (i.e \(\varphi\)
will be the case \(n\) time units hence). These operators presuppose
that time has a certain metric structure and can be carved up into
temporal units, which may be associated with clock times (e.g. hours,
days, years, etc.). If the relevant units are days, for example, the
operator \(F 1\) reads &lsquo;tomorrow&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Prior noted that \(P n\varphi\) can be defined as \(F(-n)\varphi.\)
The case \(n=0\) accordingly amounts to the present tense. The metric
operators validate combination principles such as:</p> 

\[FnFm\varphi \rightarrow F(n+m)\varphi.\] 

<p>
The interrelation of the metric and non-metric versions of the
temporal operators is captured by the following equivalences:</p>

\[\begin{matrix}
P\varphi \equiv \exists {n}({n} \lt 0 \land Fn\varphi) 
   &amp; F\varphi \equiv \exists n(n \gt 0 \land Fn\varphi) \\
H\varphi \equiv \forall {n}({n} \lt 0 \rightarrow Fn\varphi) 
   &amp; G\varphi \equiv \forall n(n \gt 0 \rightarrow Fn\varphi).
\end{matrix}\]

<p>
Instant-based temporal logics for metric time are studied in e.g.
Rescher and Urquhart (1971, Chapter X); Montanari (1996); and
Montanari and Policriti (1996). For metric interval logics, see
Bresolin et al. (2013).</p>

<p>
Various metric extensions of temporal logics over the structure of the
real numbers have been proposed as well, giving rise to so-called
<em>real-time</em> logics. These logics introduce additional
operators, such as the following, which allow for different
formalizations of the example sentence &ldquo;whenever \(p\) holds in
the future, \(q\) will hold within three time units later&rdquo;:</p>

<ul>

<li>time-bounded operators, e.g.: \(G(p \to F_{_{\leq 3}} q);\)</li>

<li>freeze quantifiers (similar to hybrid logic reference pointers),
e.g.: \(Gx. (p \to Fy. (q \land y\leq x+3));\)</li>

<li>quantifiers over time variables, e.g.: \(\forall x G(p \land t=x
\to F(q \land t\leq x+3)).\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Such real-time extensions are usually very expressive and often lead
to logics with undecidable decision problems. A way to regain
decidability is to relax &ldquo;punctuality&rdquo; requirements
involving precise time durations, by requirements involving time
intervals. For details, see e.g. Koymans (1990); Alur and Henzinger (1992; 1993; 1994)
as well as Reynolds (2010; 2014) on the real-time linear temporal
logic RTL, and the survey Konur (2013).</p>

<h3><a id="QuaProTemLog">7.3 Quantified propositional temporal logics</a></h3>

<p>
Propositional temporal logics can be extended with quantifiers over
atomic propositions (see Rescher and Urquhart 1971, Chapter XIX).
Semantically, these quantify over all valuations of the respective
atomic propositions and hence are tantamount to monadic second-order
quantifiers. The resulting languages are very expressive, and the
respective logics are usually undecidable (often not even recursively
axiomatizable). Notable extensions include the logic QPTL, the
quantified propositional version of LTL (which is decidable albeit
with non-elementary complexity), as well as the extension of CTL* (see
French 2001). Complete axiomatic systems and decidability results for
the quantified propositional temporal logic QPTL (with and without
past operators) have been presented in Kesten and Pnueli (2002) and
French and Reynolds (2003).</p>

<h2><a id="FirOrdTemLog">8. First-order temporal logics</a></h2>

<p>
Objects exist in time, and they change their properties over time.
Propositional temporal logics are not expressive enough to capture
this dynamic aspect of the world, for all that is associated with a
time instant in a model of propositional temporal logics is a set of
abstract atomic propositions that are declared true there. What is
needed, instead, is a full-fledged model of the temporal history of
the world, with objects that may have certain properties and stand in
certain relations. Accordingly, the language should contain names for
objects, variables and quantifiers ranging over objects, as well as
predicates for denoting properties and relations, to adequately
describe how the world is at a given instant in time &mdash; in
addition to temporal operators for reasoning about how the world
changes over time. This is what first-order temporal logics
provide.</p>

<h3><a id="ExiQua">8.1 Existence and quantification in time</a></h3>

<p>
Existence in time is a major topic in the philosophy of time. Usually,
objects come into being at one point in time and go out of being at
some later time. But what is it for an object to exist in time? Do
only present objects exist, as a <em>presentist</em> would have it, or
is existence to be understood in a broader sense comprising past and
future objects as well, as an <em>eternalist</em> would hold? The
controversy between <em>presentism</em> and <em>eternalism</em> is
accompanied by a debate on <em>persistence</em>, that is, on the
question how objects exist through time. Are objects wholly present at
each instant at which they exist &mdash; a view known as
<em>endurantism</em> &mdash; or do they persist by having different
temporal stages at different instants in time &mdash; a view called
<em>perdurantism</em>? For a detailed overview of these debates, see
e.g.&nbsp;Dyke and Bardon (2013), Meyer (2013), as well as the entries
on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time/">time</a>,
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/temporal-parts/">temporal parts</a>, and
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-time/">identity over time</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Similar questions concerning the existence of objects in time and
their identity over time arise in the context of first-order temporal
logics, albeit under a different guise. These questions become
particularly important when it comes to the interaction of temporality
and quantification. For example, the sentence &ldquo;A philosopher
will be a king&rdquo; can be interpreted in several different ways,
such
 as<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<ul>

<li><p>
\(\exists {x}(philosopher({x})\land {F} \, king({x}))\)
<br />
<em>Someone who is now a philosopher will be a king at some future
time.</em></p></li>

<li><p>
\(\exists {x}{F} (philosopher({x})\land king({x}))\)
<br />
<em>There now exists someone who will at some future time be both a
philosopher and a king.</em></p></li>

<li><p>
\({F} \exists {x}(philosopher({x})\land {F}\, king({x}))\)
<br />
<em>There will exist someone who is a philosopher and later will be a
king.</em></p></li>

<li><p>
\({F} \exists {x}(philosopher({x})\land king({x}))\)
<br />
<em>There will exist someone who is at the same time both a
philosopher and a king.</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The interpretations given above assume that the domain of
quantification is always relative to a time instant and that the same
individual may exist at multiple times. To enable these
interpretations, we need to introduce in the models a <em>local
domain</em> of objects \({D}({t})\) for each time instant \(t\), to
restrict the range of the quantifiers to that domain, and to identify
the same object across different times.</p>

<p>
Moreover, the example above suggests that the local domain at a given
time instant contains exactly those individuals that do in fact exist
at that instant. From a logical point of view, however, there are
alternative ways how to think of the local domains associated with
time instants, which mirror different conceptions of existence in
time. Here are four natural options:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
Objects come into being at one point in time and go out of being at a
later time, i.e., they actually exist only over a certain period of
time. This idea can be formally captured by assuming that the local
domain at a given time instant comprises those, and only those,
objects that presently exist at that instant. Thus, objects belong to
the local domains of precisely those instants at which they actually
exist, and the local domains accordingly vary over time.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Objects actually exist over a period of time, but they remain in the
temporal history of the world once they have ceased to actually exist.
On this account, the local domain at an instant includes not only
those objects that presently exist but all past objects as well. That
is, the local domains increase as time progresses and new objects come
into being.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Alternatively, one may hold that all objects that will ever exist are
initially part of the temporal history of the world but drop out once
they have ceased to actually exist. Technically, this amounts to the
idea that the local domain at an instant comprises all present and
future objects. Thus, the local domains decrease as time progresses
and objects go out of being.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Past, present, and future objects likewise exist. This is the notion
of existence in an eternalist sense. One way to formally capture this
idea is by requiring that the local domain associated with a time
instant contains all objects that are part of the temporal history of
the world. Hence, the local domains remain constant over
time.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
A conceptually different but technically closely related issue
concerns the scope of quantification. What do we quantify over in a
temporal setting?</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
Only over those objects that presently exist at the current time
instant, as presupposed in the above example?</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Over all present, past, and future objects in the temporal history of
the world?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Adopting the terminology &lsquo;actualist quantification&rsquo; and
&lsquo;possibilist quantification&rsquo; by Fitting and Mendelsohn
(1998) to the temporal case, we may refer to the first kind of
quantification as <em>presentist quantification</em> and use the term
<em>eternalist quantification</em> for the latter. Depending on the
choice between these options, the sentence &ldquo;Every human is born
after 1888&rdquo;, for instance, can be true or false. It is true if
we quantify only over those humans that are currently alive; but it is
false if we quantify over all humans in the temporal history of the
world, including those that have ever lived. A further issue arising
here concerns fictitious entities, such as Santa Claus or Pippi
Longstocking, which do not actually exist at any time instant. Still,
they may be said to exist in a broader sense, and one may want to
include them in the domain of quantification. We set this issue aside
here and refer the reader to the entry on <a href="../logic-free/index.html">free logic</a>, which is a logic that allows reference to non-existing entities (cf. also <a href="#ExistPred">Section 8.6</a>).</p>

<p>
Many of the questions concerning the interrelation of existence and
quantification arising here correspond to well known problems in modal
first-order logics, where an extensive discussion on these issues
started already with Frege and Russell and peaked in the 1940s-1950s
in the works of R. Barcan-Marcus, R. Carnap, W. Quine, R. Montague,
and others (see the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal">modal logic</a>).
 A central issue in first-order modal logics relates to the validity or
invalidity of the so-called Barcan formula, a temporal version of
which intuitively says: &ldquo;If at some time in the future there
will be something that is \(Q\), then there is something now that will
be \(Q\) at some time in the future.&rdquo; Whether this statement is
guaranteed to be true crucially depends on how the local domains at
the various instants in time are construed and what our quantifiers
range over. What is more, temporal logic yields two versions of the
Barcan formula, one for the future and one for the past.</p>

<h3><a id="LanModFOL">8.2 The language and models of FOTL</a></h3>

<p>
A basic language of first-order temporal logic (FOTL) is essentially
an extension of a given first-order language by the operators \(P\)
and \(F\). Whereas in propositional temporal logics atomic
propositions are unstructured entities, in first-order temporal logics
atomic formulae are built up from terms denoting individuals and
predicate symbols denoting relations, and the language is equipped
with quantifiers ranging over individuals. (A brief overview of
first-order logic is provided in the supplementary document
  <a href="1st-order-relational.html">First-order Relational Structures and Languages</a>.) 
In what follows, we consider FOTL over a relational first-order
language (no function symbols) with equality. The set of formulae is
defined as follows:</p>

\[\varphi \ \ := \ R(\tau_1,\dots,\tau_n) \ | \ \tau_1 = \tau_2 \ | \
\bot \ | \ \neg \varphi \ | \ (\varphi \land \varphi) \ | \ \forall x
\varphi \ | \ P \varphi \ | \ F \varphi, \]

<p>
where \(R(\tau_1,\dots,\tau_n)\) and \(\tau_1 = \tau_2\) are atomic
formulae. The truth functional connectives \(\vee, \rightarrow\), and
\(\leftrightarrow\), as well as the temporal operators \(H\) and
\(G\), can be defined as usual. Moreover, the dual \(\exists\) of
\(\forall\) is defined by \(\exists x \varphi := \neg \forall x \neg
\varphi\).</p>




<p>
The models of FOTL are based on temporal frames where each time
instant is associated with a first-order relational structure.
Formally, a <em>first-order temporal model</em> is a quintuple:

\[\mathcal{M}= (T, \prec,\mathcal{U},D,\mathcal{I})
\]

 where:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
\(\mathcal{T}= \left\langle T, \prec \right\rangle\) is a temporal
frame;</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\mathcal{U}\) is the <em>global domain <span class="upright">(</span>universe<span class="upright">)</span></em>
of
the model;</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(D: T \to \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{U})\) is a <em>domain function</em>,
assigning to each time instant \(t\in T\) a <em>local domain</em>
\(D_{t} \subseteq \mathcal{U}\) such that \(\mathcal{U}= \bigcup_{t\in
 T}D_t\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup></p></li>
 
<li>

<p>
\(\mathcal{I}\) is an <em>interpretation function</em>, assigning for
each \(t\in T\):</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
an object \(\mathcal{I}_{t}(c) \in \mathcal{U}\) to each constant
symbol \(c\);</p></li>

<li>

<p>
an \(n\)-ary relation \(\mathcal{I}_{t}(R) \subseteq \mathcal{U}^{n}\)
to each \(n\)-ary predicate symbol \(R\).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note, that the interpretations of the constant and predicate symbols
are defined locally, i.e.&nbsp;with respect to a given time instant,
while the respective extensions range over the global domain. This
approach allows for reference to objects that do not currently exist
and enables a proper treatment of cross-temporal relations, as, for
example, in the sentence &ldquo;One of my friends is a descendant of a
follower of William the Conqueror&rdquo;.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The quadruple \(\mathcal{F} = (T,\prec,\mathcal{U},D)\) is called the
<em>augmented temporal frame</em> of the model \(\mathcal{M}\). Since
the model is supposed to represent the temporal evolution of the
world, the local domains at the different time instants in the
underlying augmented temporal frame must be suitably connected. There
are four natural cases to distinguish for an augmented temporal frame,
respectively for any first-order temporal model based on it:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
<em>varying domains</em>: no restrictions apply;</p></li>

<li>

<p>
<em>expanding <span class="upright">(</span>increasing<span class="upright">)</span>
domains</em>: for all \(t,t' \in T\), if
\(t \prec t',\) then \(D_{t} \subseteq D_{t'}\);</p></li>

<li>

<p>
<em>shrinking <span class="upright">(</span>decreasing<span class="upright">)</span>
domains</em>: for all \(t,t' \in T\), if
\(t \prec t',\) then \(D_{t'} \subseteq D_{t}\);</p></li>

<li>

<p>
<em>locally constant domains</em>: for all \(t,t' \in T\), if \(t
\prec t',\) then \(D_{t} = D_{t'}\).</p>

<p>
Thus, an augmented temporal frame \(\mathcal{F}\) has locally constant
domains if and only if it has both expanding and shrinking domains. In
particular, we say that \(\mathcal{F}\) has <em>a constant domain</em>
if all local domains are the same as the global domain. Since the
global domain is required to be the union of all local domains, having
locally constant domains implies having a constant domain in case the
set of time instants forms a temporally connected whole.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
One natural way to make sense of the four cases distinguished here is
by means of the four notions of existence in time discussed in
 Section&nbsp;<a href="#ExiQua">8.1</a>
 above.</p>

<h3><a id="ForSemFOL">8.3 Semantics of FOTL</a></h3>

<p>
As in propositional temporal logic, formulae of FOTL are evaluated in
first-order temporal models locally at time instants. However, since
the formulae of FOTL may contain variables, the notion of truth is
relativized not only to a model and a time instant but also to a
variable assignment. We denote the set of individual variables of FOTL
by \(\mathrm{VAR}\) and the set of individual terms
(i.e.&nbsp;variables and constants) by \(\mathrm{TERM}\).</p>

<p>
Given a first-order temporal model \(\mathcal{M}= (T,
\prec,\mathcal{U},D,\mathcal{I})\), a <em>variable assignment in
\(\mathcal{M}\)</em> is a mapping \(v: \mathrm{VAR} \to \mathcal{U}\)
that assigns to each variable \(x \in \mathrm{VAR}\) an element
\(v(x)\) in the global domain \(\mathcal{U}\) of the model. Each such
assignment \(v\) can be uniquely extended to a <em>term valuation</em>
\(v: T \times \mathrm{TERM} \to \mathcal{U}\) as follows: 

\[v_{t}(x) := v(x), \  v_{t}(c) :=  \mathcal{I}_{t}(c).
\]

Note that the variable assignment is defined globally, whereas the
valuation of the constant symbols depends on the respective time
instant.</p>

<p>
The <em>truth of an arbitrary formula \(\varphi\) of FOTL at a given
time instant \(t\) in a given first-order temporal model
\(\mathcal{M}\) with respect to a variable assignment \(v\)</em>
(denoted \(\mathcal{M},t \models_{v} \varphi\)) is now defined
inductively as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>
\(\mathcal{M},t \models_{v} R(\tau_{1},\ldots,\tau_{n})\) &nbsp; iff &nbsp;
\((v_{t}(\tau_{1}),\ldots,v_{t}(\tau_{n})) \in \mathcal{I}_{t}(R)\),

</ul>

<p>
where \(v[a/x]\) is the variant of the variable assignment \(v\) such
that \(v[a/x](x) = a\).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
As we mentioned earlier, there are two natural approaches to
quantification in temporal logic: <em>presentist quantification</em>
and <em>eternalist quantification</em>. Technically, presentist
quantification amounts to quantification over the <em>local</em>
domain at the given time instant whereas eternalist quantification is
construed as quantification over the <em>global</em> domain. The
respective semantic clauses for the dual \(\exists\) of \(\forall\)
accordingly read as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
\(\mathcal{M},t\models_{v} \exists x \varphi\) iff &mldr;</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
<em>presentist quantification</em>:
&mldr;\(\mathcal{M},t\models_{v[a/x]} \varphi\) for some \(a\in
D_t\);</p></li>

<li>

<p>
<em>eternalist quantification</em>:
&mldr;\(\mathcal{M},t\models_{v[a/x]} \varphi\) for some \(a\in
\mathcal{U}\).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that presentist quantification naturally relates to first-order
temporal models with varying domains, while in the semantics based on
eternalist quantification the local domains do not play any essential
role. In fact, from a technical point of view, eternalist
quantification amounts to the assumption that the model has a constant
domain, i.e., all local domains equal the global domain. Moreover, in
constant domain models the semantics based on presentist
quantification coincides with the semantics based on eternalist
quantification. Thus, presentist quantification suggests a <em>varying
domain semantics</em>, whereas the semantics associated with
eternalist quantification is a <em>constant domain semantics</em>, and
in what follows we will use these expressions interchangeably.</p>

<p>
In each of these semantics, a FOTL formula \(\varphi\) is said to be
<em>valid in a model \(\mathcal{M}\)</em> iff it is true in that model
at each time instant with respect to every variable assignment; it is
<em>valid in an augmented temporal frame</em> iff it is valid in each
model based on that frame; and it is <em>valid</em> iff it is valid in
every model.</p>

<p>
Adopting one or the other approach to quantification affects the
notion of validity, even for non-temporal principles. For instance, the
sentence \(\exists x(x= c)\) is valid in first-order logic, and it is
valid in the constant domain semantics as well, but it is no longer
valid in the varying domain semantics, because the object assigned to
the constant \(c\) may not belong to the local domain. Another
principle from plain first-order logic that distinguishes the two
semantics is the scheme of <em>Universal Instantiation</em> (where
\(\tau\) is any term free for substitution for \(x\) in \(\varphi\)):

\[\forall x \varphi(x) \to  \varphi(\tau),
\]

 which is, likewise, valid in the constant domain
semantics but invalid in the varying domain semantics, for analogous
reasons. The main distinction between the two semantics is, however,
in terms of principles that involve interaction of temporal operators
and quantification, such as the Barcan formula schemata and their
converses. In the following two sections, we take a closer look at
some important validities and non-validities in the respective
semantics.</p>

<h3><a id="EterConst">8.4 Eternalist quantification and constant domain semantics</a></h3>

<p>
Let us look at some FOTL validities and non-validities in the constant
domain semantics, that is, in the semantics with eternalist
quantification. We denote validity in the constant domain semantics by
\(\models_{\mathrm{CD}}\).</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
All FOTL instances of valid first-order formulae are
CD-valid.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
In particular, the scheme of <em>Universal Instantiation</em> is
CD-valid:
<br />
\(\models_{\mathrm{CD}} \forall x \varphi(x) \to \varphi(\tau)\), for
any term \(\tau\) free for substitution for \(x\) in
\(\varphi\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The <em>Future Barcan
 Formula</em><sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
 scheme, \(\mathsf{BF}_{G}\), is CD-valid:
<br />
\(\models_{\mathrm{CD}} \forall x G \varphi(x) \to G \forall x
\varphi(x)\) or, equivalently, 
<br />
\(\models_{\mathrm{CD}} F \exists x
\varphi(x) \to \exists x F \varphi(x)\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The <em>Converse Future Barcan Formula</em> scheme,
\(\mathsf{CBF}_{G}\), is CD-valid:
<br />
\(\models_{\mathrm{CD}} G \forall x \varphi(x) \to \forall x G
\varphi(x)\) or, equivalently, 
<br />
\(\models_{\mathrm{CD}} \exists x F
\varphi(x) \to F \exists x \varphi(x)\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Some important non-validities include:
<br />
\(\not\models_{\mathrm{CD}} \forall x F \varphi(x) \to F \forall x
\varphi(x)\) &nbsp;and &nbsp;\(\not \models_{\mathrm{CD}} G \exists x
\varphi(x) \to \exists x G \varphi(x)\).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Analogous claims hold for the past versions of the above schemes, with
\(H\) and \(P\) instead of \(G\) and \(F\). An axiomatic system for
the minimal FOTL with constant domain semantics, as well as some
important theorems of it, are provided in the supplementary
document:</p>

  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>
  
<h3><a id="PresVary">8.5 Presentist quantification and varying domain semantics</a></h3>

<p>
In the varying domain semantics, free variables range over the global
domain, whereas quantifiers are given a presentist reading, i.e., they
quantify over the local domains only. As a consequence, some formulae
that are valid in the semantics with constant domains are no longer
valid in the varying domain semantics. Most importantly, the varying
domain semantics invalidates Universal Instantiation \(\forall x
\varphi(x) \to \varphi(\tau)\) as well as both the Future and Past
Barcan Formula schemata and their converses. We denote validity in the
varying domain semantics by \(\models_{\mathrm{VD}}\).</p>

<p>
In fact, the Barcan formulae schemata \(\mathsf{BF}_{G}\) and
\(\mathsf{BF}_{H}\) and their converses \(\mathsf{CBF}_{G}\) and
\(\mathsf{CBF}_{H}\) correspond to conditions on the local domains.
For any augmented temporal frame \(\mathcal{F}\), the following
holds:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
\(\mathcal{F}\) has expanding domains iff \(\mathcal{F}
\models_{\mathrm{VD}} \mathsf{BF}_{H}\) iff \(\mathcal{F}
\models_{\mathrm{VD}} \mathsf{CBF}_{G}\);</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\mathcal{F}\) has shrinking domains iff \(\mathcal{F}
\models_{\mathrm{VD}} \mathsf{BF}_{G}\) iff \(\mathcal{F}
\models_{\mathrm{VD}} \mathsf{CBF}_{H}\).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that the Future Barcan scheme \(\mathsf{BF}_{G}\) semantically
corresponds to the converse Past Barcan scheme \(\mathsf{CBF}_{H}\),
and <em>vice versa</em>. From the above it follows that an augmented
temporal frame \(\mathcal{F}\) has locally constant domains iff either
of the following formulae is <span>VD</span>-valid in \(\mathcal{F}\):
\(\mathsf{BF}_{G} \wedge \mathsf{BF}_{H}\), \(\mathsf{CBF}_{G} \wedge
\mathsf{CBF}_{H}\), \(\mathsf{BF}_{G} \wedge \mathsf{CBF}_{G}\), or
\(\mathsf{BF}_{H} \wedge \mathsf{CBF}_{H}\).</p>

<p>
An axiomatic system for the minimal FOTL with varying domain semantics
is provided in the supplementary document:</p>

<h3><a id="ExistPred">8.6 The existence predicate</a></h3>

<p>
While presentism and eternalism are alternative theories in the
philosophy of time, their respective technical manifestations are
interreducible. On the one hand, the constant domain semantics with
eternalist quantification can be obtained from the varying domain
semantics with presentist quantification by imposing the constraint
that the Past and Future Barcan Formula schemata and their converses
be valid. On the other hand, the varying domain semantics can be
simulated in the constant domain semantics by adding to the language
of FOTL an <em>existence predicate</em> for &lsquo;existence at the
current time instant&rsquo;, which can be defined in the varying
domain semantics by \(E(\tau) := \exists x (x=\tau)\).</p>

<p>
With the existence predicate at our disposal, the sentence &ldquo;Some
man exists who signed the Declaration of Independence&rdquo; can be
formalized in two different ways: 

\[\exists x(\mathsf{man}(x) \land P(\mathsf{signs}(x)))
\]

 and 

\[\exists x(E(x) \land \mathsf{man}(x) \land P(\mathsf{signs}(x))).
\]

 While
the former formula is true at the present instant in the constant
domain semantics with eternalist quantification, the latter formula is
presently false in that semantics, but it was true in 1777.</p>

<p>
To generalize, for every formula \(\varphi\) of FOTL, its
<em>\(E\)-relativization</em> in the extended language can be obtained
by replacing every occurrence of \(\forall x\) in \(\varphi\) by
&ldquo;\(\forall x (E(x) \to ...)\)&rdquo; and every occurrence of
\(\exists x\) by &ldquo;\(\exists x (E(x) \land ...)\)&rdquo;. Then
the following holds: for any FOTL sentence \(\varphi\) not containing
\(E\), \(\varphi\) is valid in the varying domain semantics if and
only if its \(E\)-relativization is valid in the constant domain
semantics. The question that remains, from a philosophical
point of view, is whether existence is a legitimate predicate. An axiomatic system for the minimal FOTL with existence
predicate can be obtained along the lines of free logic, as outlined
in the supplementary document:</p>

<blockquote>
  <a href="axiomatic-fotl-free.html">Axioms for the Minimal FOTL with \(E\): the Free Logic Version</a>
  </blockquote>


<h3><a id="NameDesc">8.7 Proper names and definite descriptions</a></h3>

<p>
A further issue arising in first-order temporal logic relates to the
interpretation of individual terms. Depending on what kind of terms we
are dealing with, we may or may not want to allow their interpretation
to vary with time.</p>

<p>
In the semantics outlined above, variable assignments are defined
globally, and hence individual variables pick out the same object at
all times. The interpretation of constant symbols, on the other hand, is
specified locally, relative to a time instant, even though the
respective extensions range over the global domain. From a
philosophical point of view, it seems natural to treat constant
symbols as <em>proper names</em> or as <em>rigid designators</em>,
that is, to impose the additional requirement that their
interpretations be constant across different times. Constant symbols
can then be used to identify an object in time. For instance, treating
\(a\) as a name for Aristotle, the sentence &ldquo;Aristotle existed
but does no longer exist&rdquo; can be formalized in the varying domain
semantics as \(P \exists x(x=a) \wedge \neg\exists x(x=a)\).</p>

<p>
If constants are treated as rigid designators, the principle of
<em>Necessity of Identity</em> \(\tau_1 = \tau_2 \rightarrow A(\tau_1
= \tau_2)\) is valid, for both variables and constants (recall that
\(A \varphi = H \varphi \land \varphi \land G\varphi\)). However, the
language may also contain individual terms for which this principle
fails. A core example are <em>definite descriptions</em>, such as
&ldquo;the Pope&rdquo;, which may pick out different objects at
different times. Importantly, proper names and definite descriptions
require a different semantic treatment and are not freely
inter-substitutable. For example &ldquo;The Pope has been the
sovereign of the Vatican City since 1929&rdquo; is true, whereas
&ldquo;Jorge Mario Bergoglio has been the sovereign of the Vatican
City since 1929&rdquo; is false. Moreover, in a temporal setting, the
question arises how to deal with definite descriptions that refer to
objects that do no longer or not yet exist, such as &ldquo;the first
child to be born in South Africa in 2050&rdquo;. The problems get even
more intricate in a branching time setting, where time and modality
are combined. Note, for instance, that some definite descriptions that
are temporally rigid may be modally non-rigid. For more on definite
descriptions in the context of temporal logic, see Rescher and
Urquhart (1971, Chapters XIII and XX) and Cocchiarella (2002).</p>

<p>
One way to deal with definite descriptions is to switch from an
extensional to an intensional account of individual terms. That is,
rather than assigning to each term at each time instant an
<em>extension</em>, i.e.&nbsp;an object from the domain, one may
assign to each term an <em>intension</em>, i.e.&nbsp;a function from
time instants to objects. A general framework in which individual
terms are assigned both extensions and intensions is the Case
Intensional First-Order Logic (CIFOL) proposed in Belnap and
M<span>&uuml;</span>ller (2014a; 2014b). In CIFOL, identity is
extensional, predication is intensional, and individuals can be
identified across times without making use of rigid designation. The
framework is also interesting against the background of the debate on
persistence as it remains metaphysically neutral with respect to the
precise nature of the objects included in the overall domain.</p>

<h3><a id="TechRes">8.8 Some technical results on first-order temporal logics</a></h3>

<p>
First-order temporal logics are very expressive, and this often comes
with a high computational price: these logics can be deductively very
complex and are typically <em>highly</em> undecidable (cf. Merz 1992;
Gabbay et al.&nbsp;1994; Hodkinson et al. 2002). The first-order
temporal logic with constant domain semantics over the natural
numbers, for example, with only two variables and unary relation
symbols, is not only undecidable but not even recursively
axiomatizable (cf. B&ouml;rger et al.&nbsp;1997; Hodkinson et al.
2000).</p>

<p>
Few axiomatizable, and even fewer decidable, natural fragments of
first-order temporal logics have been identified and investigated so
far. These include first-order temporal logics with <em>Since</em> and
<em>Until</em> over the class of all linear flows of time and over the
order of the rationals (Merz 1992; Reynolds 1996), the fragment T(FOs) of
FOTL, where temporal operators may not occur inside the scope of a
quantifier (Gabbay et al.&nbsp;1994, Chapter 14), as well as the
<em>monodic fragment</em>, only allowing formulae with at most one free variable in the scope of a temporal operator (see Hodkinson et al.&nbsp;2000; 2001; 2002
and Wolter and Zakharyaschev 2002). Still, as shown in the latter
paper, already the monodic fragment with equality is no longer
recursively axiomatizable. For further decidability results for
suitably restricted fragments of FOTL, see Hodkinson et
al.&nbsp;(2000). Additional technical references are given in Gabbay
et al.&nbsp;(1994, Chapter 14) and Kr&ouml;ger and Merz (2008). For
completeness results for first-order modal logics see also Fitting and
Mendelsohn (1998) and the entry on
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal">modal logic</a>.</p>
 
<p>

logics, see Rescher and Urquhart (1971, Chapter XX); McArthur (1976);

<h2><a id="ComTemOthLog">9. Combining temporal and other logics</a></h2>

<p>
Logics can be used to reason about dynamically changing aspects of the
world, and time plays a role in many domains. For instance, the notion
of knowledge studied in epistemic logic, the idea of an action
underlying logics of agency, or the physical concept of space in
spatial logics all bear an intimate relation to time. It is therefore
natural to add a temporal dimension to these logics and equip the
corresponding languages with temporal operators that are suited to
capture the relevant notion of change.</p>

<p>
From a technical point of view, there are several ways of combining
models and logical systems: products, fusions, etc. (see the entry on
 <a href="../logic-combining/index.html">combining logics</a>).
 These constructions provide different mechanisms for temporalizing a
logic and raise generic questions about transfer of logical
properties, such as axiomatizations, completeness, decidability.
Decidability, for instance, is usually preserved in fusions, while it
is often lost in products of logical systems. For a general discussion
of temporalizing logical systems and properties of temporalized
logics, see Finger and Gabbay (1992; 1996); Finger et al. (2002); and
Gabbay et al. (2003). Here we only present and briefly discuss some of
the most popular cases of temporalized logical systems.</p>

<h3><a id="TemEpiLog">9.1 Temporal-epistemic logics</a></h3>

<p>
Temporal-epistemic logics bring together temporal logics and
(multi-agent) logics of knowledge. Some interesting properties can
naturally be expressed by combining the epistemic modality \(K\)
(&ldquo;the agent knows that&rdquo;) with temporal operators, e.g.
<em>perfect recall</em>: \(K \varphi \to GK \varphi\) (If the agent
knows \(\varphi\) now, then the agent will always know \(\varphi\) in
the future) and <em>no learning</em>: \(FK \varphi \to K
\varphi\).</p>

<p>
Various temporal-epistemic logics were developed during the 1980s,
with a unifying study by Halpern and Vardi (1989). They consider a
variety of 96 temporal-epistemic logics on so-called <em>interpreted
systems</em>, i.e. sets of runs in a transition system with epistemic
indistinguishability relations on the state space for each agent. The
variety is based on several parameters: <em>number of agents</em> (one
or many), <em>the language</em> (with or without common knowledge),
<em>the formal model of time</em> (linear or branching time),
<em>recall abilities</em> (no recall, bounded recall, or perfect
recall), <em>learning abilities</em> (learning or no learning),
<em>synchrony</em> (synchronous or asynchronous), <em>unique initial
state</em>. Depending on the particular choice of these parameters,
the computational complexity of the decision problem for these logics
ranges very broadly from PSPACE-complete to highly undecidable
(\(\Pi^{1}_{1}\)-complete). For details, see Halpern and Vardi (1989);
Fagin et al. (1995); as well as the more recent van Benthem and Pacuit
(2006), which surveys a number of decidability and undecidability
results for temporal-epistemic logics and illustrates how the
combination of time with other modalities bears on computational
complexity.</p>

<h3><a id="TemLogLogAge">9.2 Temporal logics and logics of agency</a></h3>

<p>
Temporal reasoning is an important aspect of reasoning about agents
and their actions. The probably most influential family of logics of
agency in philosophical studies is the family of so-called
<em>stit</em> logics, originating from the work of Belnap and Perloff
(1988). These logics contain formulae of the form
<em>stit</em>\(\varphi\), reading &ldquo;The agent sees to it that
\(\varphi\)&rdquo;, which allow one to reason about how an
agent&rsquo;s choices to act bear on the world. The original versions
of <em>stit</em> logic do not involve temporal operators.
Nevertheless, their semantics is based on Ockhamist branching time
models, where an agent&rsquo;s set of choices at a given time instant
is represented by a partition of the set of histories passing through
that instant. Intuitively, the formula <em>stit</em>\(\varphi\) is
true at a given time instant \(t\) with respect to a given history
\(h\) iff the agent&rsquo;s choice at the instant \(t\) with respect
to the history \(h\) guarantees that \(\varphi\), i.e. if \(\varphi\)
is true at \(t\) relative to all histories in the respective choice
cell. For a detailed discussion of varieties of <em>stit</em> logic
and their historical development, see Belnap et al. (2001) and the
entry on
 <a href="../logic-action/index.html">the logic of action</a>.
 Temporal extensions of <em>stit</em> logics have been proposed in
Broersen (2011) and Lorini (2013): in Broersen (2011) the
<em>stit</em> operator is combined with the <em>Next Time</em>
operator \(X\) into a single operator which requires that the
objective be met in the next step, whereas in Lorini (2013) the
<em>stit</em> operator and the temporal operators are treated
separately.</p>

<p>
Another important family of temporal logics of agency are the
<em>alternating-time logics</em> ATL and ATL*, introduced in Alur et
al. (2002). ATL and ATL* are multi-agent extensions of the computation
tree logics CTL and CTL*, and they have become a popular logical
framework for strategic reasoning in multi-agent systems.
Alternating-time temporal logics enrich the language with strategic
path quantifiers \(\langle\!\langle C \rangle\!\rangle \varphi,\)
intuitively saying &ldquo;The coalition \(C\) has a collective
strategy to guarantee that the objective \(\varphi\) is met on every
path enabled by that collective strategy&rdquo;, where the objective
\(\varphi\) is a temporal formula. While <em>stit</em> logics build on
the rather abstract notion of a history, ATL and ATL* are interpreted
over so-called concurrent game structures, in which paths are viewed
as sequences of successor states that are generated by discrete
transitions caused by collective actions of all agents. A combination
of ATL and <em>stit</em> theory was developed in Broersen et al.
(2006). The branching time logics CTL and CTL* can be regarded as
single-agent versions of ATL and ATL*. Even though the latter are
quite more expressive, they generally preserve the good computational
properties of the former. For further details, see Alur et al. (2002),
as well as Goranko and van Drimmelen (2006), where a complete
axiomatization and decidability results for ATL are established. A
general introduction to ATL from a temporal logic perspective is
provided in Demri et al. (2016, Chapter 9).</p>

<h3><a id="SpaTemLog">9.3 Spatial-temporal logics</a></h3>

<p>
Space and time are intimately related in the physical world, and they
have become inseparable in modern physical theories. While early
physical theories, culminating in Newton&rsquo;s classical mechanics,
presuppose an absolute notion of time independent from space,
Einstein&rsquo;s relativity theory views time and space as
inextricably interwoven, as modeled by Minkowski&rsquo;s
four-dimensional space-time manifold.</p>

<p>
Combined logical reasoning about space-time is discussed in Rescher
and Urquhart (1971, Chapter XVI). In Goldblatt (1980), the Diodorean
modal logic of Minkowski space-time was studied and proved to be
exactly the modal logic D4.2; further results are provided in Uckelman
and Uckelman (2007). Logical investigations into relativity theory
have been conducted as well, see e.g. Andr&eacute;ka et al.
(2007).</p>

<p>
In Artificial Intelligence, space-time reasoning has been actively
evolving over the past decades, particularly in the context of
spatio-temporal databases, ontologies, and constraint networks. The
main focus here is on the logical characterization of spatio-temporal
models, expressiveness, and computational complexity (Gabelaia et al.
2005; Kontchakov et al. 2007).</p>

<p>
Another interesting line of research is triggered by the theory of
branching space-times developed in Belnap (1992). This theory relates
to space-time just as Prior&rsquo;s theory of branching time relates
to linear time; that is, it combines space-time reasoning with
indeterminism. See e.g. M&uuml;ller (2013) and Placek (2014), where
the topology of branching space-times is studied against the
background of relativity theory. An extensive overview of branching space-times can be found in Belnap et al. (2022).</p>

<h3><a id="TemDesLog">9.4 Temporal description logics</a></h3>

<p>
Description logics are essentially variations of modal logics. They
involve <em>concepts</em> (unary predicates) and <em>roles</em>
(binary predicates) and are used to describe various ontologies and
the relations between the concepts in them (see e.g. Baader and Lutz
2006). Description logics can be temporalized in various ways. For
details, see Artale and Franconi (2000); Wolter and Zakharyaschev
(2000); and Lutz et al. (2008).</p>

<h3><a id="TemLogOthNonClaLog">9.5 Temporal logics and other non-classical logics</a></h3>

<p>
Temporal reasoning can naturally be combined with various
non-classical logical systems, resulting, for instance, in many-valued
temporal logics (Rescher and Urquhart 1971, Chapter XVIII),
intuitionistic temporal logics (Ewald 1986), constructive and
paraconsistent temporal logics (Kamide and Wansing 2010; 2011),
probabilistic temporal logics (Hart and Sharir 1986; Konur 2013),
etc.</p>

<h2><a id="LogDedDecMetForTemLog">10. Logical deduction and decision methods for temporal logics</a></h2>

<p>
Extensive research and numerous publications over the past 50 years
have developed a variety of logical deduction systems and decision
methods for the temporal logics mentioned here and many more.
<em>Hilbert style axiomatic systems</em> are the most common logical
deduction systems for temporal logics, but many complete systems of
<em>semantic tableaux</em>, <em>sequent calculi</em>, and
<em>resolution-based systems</em> have been proposed as well. Some
general references on deductive systems for temporal logics (in
addition to the more specific references mentioned elsewhere in this
text) include: Rescher and Urquhart (1971); McArthur (1976); Burgess
(1984); Emerson (1990); Goldblatt (1992); Gabbay et al. (1994); van
Benthem (1995); Bolc and Szalas (1995); Gabbay and Guenthner (2002);

Baier and Katoen (2008); Kr&ouml;ger and Merz (2008); Fisher (2011);
Demri et al. (2016).</p>

<p>
One of the most important logical decision problems is to determine
whether a given formula of a given logic is valid (resp. satisfiable)
in the semantics provided for that logic. Particularly efficient and
practically useful for deciding satisfiability are the
<em>tableaux-based methods</em>, originating from pioneering work of
Beth, Hintikka, Smullyan, and Fitting. These methods are based on a
systematic search of a satisfying model (resp. falsifying countermodel)
if an input formula that is tested for satisfiability is provided, and
they are guaranteed to find such a model whenever it exists.
Tableaux-based methods have been successfully developed for
constructive satisfiability testing for a variety of temporal logics.
See Gor&eacute; (1999) for a survey on tableaux systems for many
temporal logics and more specifically: Ben-Ari et al. (1983) for the
branching time logic UB; Emerson and Halpern (1985) for the
computation tree logic CTL; Wolper (1985) for the linear time temporal
logic LTL; Kontchakov et al. (2004) on temporalizing tableaux;
Reynolds (2007) for CTL with bundled tree semantics; Goranko and
Shkatov (2010) for ATL; Reynolds (2011) for the full computation tree
logic CTL*; Reynolds (2014) for the real-time temporal logic RTL,
etc.</p>

<p>
Other methods that have proven practically fruitful for deciding
satisfiability as well as for model checking of temporal logics in
computer science are the <em>automata-based methods</em>, which have
been actively developing since the early 1990s. These methods
transform temporal formulae into automata on infinite words (for
linear time logics) or infinite trees (for branching time logics) and
represent models for the logics as input objects (infinite words or
trees) for their associated automata. Thus, satisfiability of a
formula becomes equivalent to the language of the associated automaton
being non-empty. The methods are based on classical results about
decidability of the monadic second-order theories of the natural
numbers (by B&uuml;chi) and of the infinite binary tree (by Rabin).
For instance, in Emerson and Sistla (1984), automata on infinite trees
and Rabin&rsquo;s theorem were used to obtain a decision procedure for
CTL*. For further details see Vardi (2006).</p>

<p>
Important references on decidability results and decision procedures
for various temporal logics include: Burgess (1980) and Gurevich and
Shelah (1985) for branching time logics; Burgess and Gurevich (1985)
for linear temporal logics; Goldblatt (1992) for both linear and
branching time logics; Montanari and Policriti (1996) for metric and
layered temporal logics; French (2001) for some quantified
propositional branching time logics.</p>

<p>
While most propositional temporal logics are decidable, adding some
syntactic or semantic features can make them explode computationally
and become undecidable. The most common causes of undecidability of
temporal logics, besides combinations with other expressive logics,
include: grid-like models; temporal operators along multiple time-lines;
products of temporal logics; interval-based logics with no locality
assumptions; time reference mechanisms, such as hybrid reference pointers and freeze quantifiers; arithmetic features, such as time addition,
exact time constraints, etc. However, there are various ways to tame
temporal logics and restore decidability, such as adding syntactic and
parametric restrictions (e.g. on the number of propositional variables
or the depth of nesting), imposing suitable semantic restrictions
(e.g. locality for interval logics), identifying decidable fragments
(e.g. the two-variable fragment FO\(^{2}\) of classical first-order
logic, guarded fragments, monodic fragments), etc.</p>

<h2><a id="AppTemLog">11. Applications of temporal logics</a></h2>

<p>
Temporal logic is a field whose development has been heavily driven by
philosophical considerations. At the same time, the logical formalisms
and technical systems developed over the years have found application
in various different disciplines, ranging from computer science,
artificial intelligence, and linguistics, to natural, cognitive, and
social sciences. In this section, we briefly discuss some pertinent
applications of temporal logics in computer science, artificial
intelligence, and linguistics.</p>

<h3><a id="TemLogComSci">11.1 Temporal logics in Computer Science</a></h3>

<p>
The idea to apply temporal reasoning to the analysis of deterministic
and stochastic transition systems was already present in the theory of
processes and events in Rescher and Urquhart (1971, Chapter XIV).
However, it was with the seminal paper of Pnueli (1977) that temporal
logic became really prominent in computer science. Pnueli proposed the
application of temporal logics to the specification and verification
of <em>reactive and concurrent programs and systems</em>. In order to
ensure correct behavior of a reactive program, in which computations
are non-terminating (e.g. an operating system), it is necessary to
formally specify and verify the acceptable infinite executions of that
program. In addition, to ensure correctness of a concurrent program,
where two or more processors are working in parallel, it is necessary
to formally specify and verify their interaction and
synchronization.</p>

<p>
Key properties of infinite computations that can be captured by
temporal patterns are liveness, safety, and fairness (see Manna and
Pnueli 1992):</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li><em>Liveness</em> properties or <em>eventualities</em> involve
temporal patterns of the forms \(F{p},\) \(q \to F {p},\) or \(G(q \to
F {p}),\) which ensure that if a specific precondition (\(q\)) is
initially satisfied, then a desirable state (satisfying \(p\)) will
eventually be reached in the course of the computation. Examples are
&ldquo;If a message is sent, it will eventually be delivered&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Whenever a printing job is activated, it will eventually be
completed&rdquo;.</li>

<li><em>Safety</em> or <em>invariance</em> properties involve temporal
patterns of the forms \({G} {p},\) \(q \to {G} {p},\) or \(G(q \to {G}
{p}),\) which ensure that if a specific precondition (\(q\)) is
initially satisfied, then undesirable states (violating the safety
condition \(p\)) will never occur. Examples are: &ldquo;No more than
one process will be in its critical section at any moment of
time&rdquo;, &ldquo;A resource will never be used by two or more
processes simultaneously&rdquo;, or, to give more practical examples:
&ldquo;The traffic lights will never show green in both
directions&rdquo;, &ldquo;A train will never pass a red
semaphore&rdquo;.</li>

<li><em>Fairness</em> properties involve combinations of temporal
patterns of the forms \({GF} {p}\) (&ldquo;infinitely often
\(p\)&rdquo;) or \({FG} {p}\) (&ldquo;eventually always \(p\)&rdquo;).
Intuitively, fairness requires that whenever several processes that
share resources are run concurrently, they must be treated
&lsquo;fairly&rsquo; by the operating system, scheduler, etc. A
typical fairness requirement says that if a process is persistent
enough in sending a request (e.g. keeps sending it over and over
again), its request will eventually be granted.</li>
</ul>

<p>
An infinite computation is formally represented by a model of the
linear time temporal logic LTL. Non-deterministic systems are modeled
by branching time structures. Thus, both LTL and the computation tree
logics CTL and CTL* have been very important for specification and
verification of reactive and concurrent systems.</p>

<p>
The following example combines liveness and safety properties of a
single computation: &ldquo;Whenever a state of alert is reached, the
alarm is activated and remains activated until a safe state is
eventually reached&rdquo;. This property is expressible in LTL as</p>

\[
 G(\textsf{alert} \to (\textsf{alarm} \ U\ \textsf{safe})).
\]

<p>
Another example, referring to all computations in the system, is:
&ldquo;If the process \(\sigma\) is eventually enabled on some
computation starting from the current state, then on every computation
starting there, whenever \(\sigma\) is enabled, it will remain enabled
until the process \(\tau\) is disabled&rdquo;. This property can be
formalized in CTL* as</p> 

\[ 
\Diamond F\,\textsf{enabled}_{\sigma} \to \Box
G(\textsf{enabled}_{\sigma} \to (\textsf{enabled}_{\sigma} \,U\,
\textsf{disabled}_{\tau})).  
\]

<p>
A variation of LTL with useful applications for specifying and
reasoning about concurrent systems is Lamport&rsquo;s (1994)
<em>temporal logic of actions</em> TLA. Other applications of temporal
logics in computer science include: temporal databases, real-time
processes and systems, hardware verification, etc. Further information
on such applications can be found in e.g. Pnueli (1977); Emerson and
Clarke (1982); Moszkowski (1983); Galton (1987); Emerson (1990); Alur
and Henzinger (1992); Lamport (1994); Vardi and Wolper (1994); Bolc
and Szalas (1995); Gabbay et al. (2000); Baier and Katoen (2008);
Kr&ouml;ger and Merz (2008); Fisher (2011); Demri et al. (2016).</p>

<h3><a id="TemLogArtInt">11.2 Temporal logics in Artificial Intelligence</a></h3>

<p>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the major areas of application
of temporal logics. Relating temporal reasoning to AI was suggested
already in the early philosophical discussion on AI by McCarthy and
Hayes (1969), the theory of processes and events in Rescher and
Urquhart (1971, Chapter XIV), and the period-based theories of Hamblin
(1972); see &Oslash;hrstr&oslash;m and Hasle (1995) for an overview of
these early developments. In the 1980s, temporal representation and
reasoning gradually became an increasingly prominent theme in AI with
several influential works, including McDermott&rsquo;s temporal logic
for reasoning about processes and plans (McDermott 1982);
Allen&rsquo;s general theory of action and time (Allen 1984); the
Event Calculus of Kowalski and Sergot (1986); the reified temporal
logic by Shoham (1987); the logic of time representation by Ladkin
(1987); and the work on temporal database management by Dean and
McDermott (1987). Galton (1987) provides a systematic account of these
and other important developments in that period; see also Vila (1994)
and Pani and Bhattacharjee (2001) for comprehensive reviews.
Influential works in the 1990s include the introduction of
interval-based temporal logics by Halpern and Shoham (1991) and by
Allen and Ferguson (1994), with representation of actions and events;
the Situation Calculus of Pinto and Reiter (1995); and Lamport&rsquo;s
Action Theory (Lamport 1994), etc. Further important developments
relating temporal reasoning and AI since then include: temporal
reasoning in natural language, temporal ontologies, temporal databases
and constraint solving, temporal planning, executable temporal logics,
spatial-temporal reasoning, temporal reasoning in agent-based systems,
etc. The field has gradually grown so rich and broad &mdash; as
witnessed by the 20-chapter handbook edited by Fisher et al. (2005)
&mdash; that it is impossible to even briefly survey it here, so we
only bookmark a few of the main issues of philosophical relevance that
have been in the focus of temporal reasoning and logics in AI.</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li>The prevailing logical approach to temporal representation and
reasoning in AI, especially in the 1980s-1990s, has traditionally been
based on temporalized variations of first-order logic rather than on
Prior-style temporal logic. The approach is best illustrated by the
so-called <em>method of temporal arguments</em> (McCarthy and Hayes
1969; Shoham 1987; Vila 1994). According to this method, the temporal
dimension is captured by augmenting propositions and predicates with
&lsquo;time stamp&rsquo; arguments, as for example &ldquo;Publish(A.
Prior, <em>Time and Modality</em>, 1957)&rdquo;. An alternative, yet
closely related approach, is the one of <em>reified temporal
logics</em> (McDermott 1982; Allen 1984; Shoham 1987; see Ma and
Knight 2001 for a survey). This approach makes use of reifying
meta-predicates, such as &lsquo;TRUE&rsquo; and &lsquo;FALSE&rsquo;,
but also &lsquo;HOLDS&rsquo;, &lsquo;OCCURS&rsquo;,
&lsquo;BEFORE&rsquo;, &lsquo;AFTER&rsquo;, interval relations such as
&lsquo;MEETS&rsquo;, &lsquo;OVERLAPS&rsquo;, etc., which are applied
to propositions of some standard logical language (e.g. classical
first-order logic). An example of a reified expression is
&ldquo;OCCUR(Born(A. Prior), 1914)&rdquo;. Associated with theories of
time are theories of <em>temporal incidence</em> (cf. Vila 2005).
Still, the prominence of the modal logic based approach has always
been strong, and it has more recently resurged, e.g. in the context of
agent-based temporal reasoning (cf. Fisher and Wooldridge 2005).</li>

<li>Theories of temporal reasoning in AI distinguish between
<em>fluents</em>, which are propositions describing states of the
world that may change over time, and <em>events</em>, representing
what happens in the world and causes changes between states.
Philosophical issues arising here concern the nature of fluents and
events, the meaning of instantaneous events, the distinction between
homogeneous states and inhomogeneous events, the <em>dividing instant
problem</em>, the <em>frame problem</em>, etc. For further discussion,
see Shoham (1987); Galton (1990); and Vila (2005). See also the
related discussion on reasoning about action and change in Section 4
of the entry on
 <a href="../logic-ai/index.html">logic and artificial intelligence</a>.</li>
 
<li>Both fluents and events can be considered in discrete or
continuous time and they can be instantaneous or durational. This
keeps the debate on <em>instant-based</em> versus
<em>interval-based</em> formal models of time alive, with various
theories following and comparing both approaches, including van
Benthem (1983); Allen (1983); Allen and Hayes (1989); Allen and
Ferguson (1994); Galton (1995); Vila (2005); etc. </li>
</ul>

AI, see Vila (1994); Galton (1995); the comprehensive handbook Fisher
et al. (2005); and the more concise handbook chapter Fisher
(2008).</p>

<h3><a id="TemNatLanLin">11.3 Temporal logics in Linguistics</a></h3>

<p>
Tense is an important feature of natural languages. It is a linguistic
device that allows one to specify the relative location of events in
time, usually with respect to the speech time. In most languages,
including English, tense becomes manifest in a system of different
verbal tenses. English allows for a distinction between past, present,
and future tense (&lsquo;will&rsquo; future) and, traditionally, the
respective perfect and progressive forms are referred to as tenses as
well.</p>

<p>
As laid out above, Prior&rsquo;s invention of tense logic was largely
motivated by the use of tense in natural language. An alternative
early logical approach to tense was provided by Reichenbach (1947),
who suggested an analysis of the English verbal tenses in terms of
three points in time: speech time, event time, and reference time,
where the reference time is a contextually salient point in time,
which, intuitively, captures the perspective from which the event is
viewed. Using the notion of reference time, Reichenbach was able to
distinguish, for example, between the simple past (&ldquo;I wrote a
letter&rdquo;) and the present perfect (&ldquo;I have written a
letter&rdquo;), which are conflated in Prior&rsquo;s account. In both
cases, of simple past and of present perfect, the event time precedes
the speech time; but, in the former case the reference time coincides
with the event time whereas in the latter case the reference time is
simultaneous with the speech time.</p>

<p>
Neither Prior&rsquo;s nor Reichenbach&rsquo;s frameworks can account
for the difference between, for instance, the simple past (&ldquo;I
wrote a letter&rdquo;) and the past progressive (&ldquo;I was writing
a letter&rdquo;). The relevant distinction here is one of aspect
rather than of tense and naturally requires an interval-based or
event-based setting to be adequately dealt with. For accounts along
these lines, see e.g. Dowty (1979); Parsons (1980); Galton (1984); and
van Lambalgen and Hamm (2005).</p>

<p>
Whereas Reichenbach&rsquo;s analysis makes reference to a contextually
salient point in time, on Prior&rsquo;s account tenses are construed
as temporal operators, which are interpreted as quantifiers over
instants in time. This raises the general question: are tenses in
natural language to be treated as quantifiers, or do they refer to
specific points in time? In an influential paper, Partee (1973)
provided the following counterexample against a quantifier treatment
of tenses: the sentence &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t turn off the
stove&rdquo; means neither (1) there is an earlier time instant at
which I do not turn off the stove, nor does it mean (2) there is no
earlier instant at which I turn off the stove. The first requirement
is too weak, the second too strong. Partee suggested an analogy
between tenses and referential pronouns. According to this proposal,
tenses refer to specific, contextually given points in time (e.g. 8
o&rsquo;clock this morning), which are presupposed to stand in
appropriate temporal relations to the speech time. Subsequently,
accounts that restrict quantification to a contextually given time
interval (e.g. this morning) have become popular. On these accounts,
Partee&rsquo;s example sentence has the intuitive meaning: there is no
earlier time instant in the contextually salient time interval at
which I turn off the stove. Formally, this idea is compatible with
both a quantifier and a referential treatment of tenses; for details
see Kuhn and Portner (2002) and Ogihara (2011).</p>

<p>
Other pertinent issues in linguistics relating to time concern the
meaning of temporal adverbs and connectives, the interaction of tense
and quantification, the interpretation of embedded tenses and sequence
of tense, as well as the interrelation of tense and modality. For an
overview and further discussion on the application of temporal logics
in linguistics, see e.g. Steedman (1997); Kuhn and Portner (2002);
Mani et al. (2005); ter Meulen (2005); Moss and Tiede (2006); Ogihara
(2007; 2011); Dyke (2013); and the entry on

The first version of this entry was written by Antony Galton in 1999,
later revised in Galton (2008). In 2015 the entry was substantially
re-written and extended by the first author of the present version,
which is itself a major revision and further extension of the 2015
version. We acknowledge Galton&rsquo;s contribution to the previous
versions, and we retained one example from Galton (2008) in Section
8.1, as indicated there. We are grateful to Johan van Benthem, Rob
Goldblatt, Angelo Montanari, Yde Venema, Michael Zakharyaschev, Ed
Zalta, and Alberto Zanardo for some helpful suggestions and
corrections on the 2015 version.</p>

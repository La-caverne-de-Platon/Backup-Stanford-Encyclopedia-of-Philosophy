<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Envy</a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1" id="note-1">1.</a>
 Although the term is widely enough used that various non-emotional
patterns of behavior and motivation can be called
&ldquo;envious&rdquo; without linguistic impropriety, it seems clear
that these are so called because of their resemblance to the emotional
syndrome.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2" id="note-2">2.</a>
 This test case, and its upshot, are explored in Farrell (1980).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3" id="note-3">3.</a>
 Farrell (1989), Neu, Protasi, Roberts, Young. Typically, the point of
the distinction is to identify a class of cases in which envy is
somehow legitimate or justifiable from another class in which it is
not.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4" id="note-4">4.</a>
 This is the simplest way to draw the distinction, and the one that
will be used to frame a debate in what follows. It fits best with a
Motivational Theory of the nature of emotions. But the distinction can
also be expressed in terms that better suit a Cognitive Theory of
emotion. Then the idea would be, roughly, that invidious envy
involves, among other things, the thought that it is bad that Rival
has the good, given that Subject lacks it; whereas benign envy does
not involve a negative evaluation of the rival having the good
[em-dash] only of the subject lacking it.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5" id="note-5">5.</a>
 Thus, for instance, Rawls characterizes the distinction as being
between benign envy and &ldquo;envy proper.&rdquo; See also Nozick,
D'Arms and Jacobson (2000), D'Arms and Kerr (2008).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6" id="note-6">6.</a>
 For a discussion of this general problem, and a proposal about how
best to make sense of competing accounts of the characteristic beliefs
and desires in a range of emotions, see D'Arms and Jacobson 2002.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7" id="note-7">7.</a>
 For instance, Gabrielle Taylor (2006, p. 43) introduces a notion of
&ldquo;object-envy&rdquo; in which &ldquo;&hellip; the envy is of the
good the other has; its possessor plays a relatively minor role as
being merely the occasion for the envious person's realization of her
deficiencies.&rdquo; She then says that object envy is not vicious, in
part on the grounds that the subject of such envy &ldquo;may admire
those who possess the good and strive to improve her own position in
the relevant respect.&rdquo; It is not clear whether she thinks such
an admiring attitude would suffice for attributing object-envy, but if
so this makes it quite unclear why it should be treated as envy.
Protasi (2016) expresses a similar misgiving about Taylor's proposal,
noting that admiration is not unpleasant. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8" id="note-8">8.</a>
 See van de Ven, Zeelenberg and Pieters (2009) for some relevant
discussion. They treat this linguistic point as evidence in support of
the idea that benign envy is a kind of envy. But it is at least
unclear that the linguistic point supports that conclusion. Some
scholars, including Kripke (1977), treat the existence of distinct
words in a foreign language that are translated with a single word in
our own as evidence of ambiguity in English. In any case, it is not
clear that anything in van de Ven et al's interesting experiments
motivates translating the relevant terms as &ldquo;benign envy&rdquo;
rather than as &ldquo;emulative desire,&rdquo; or understanding the
benign and malicious phenomena they distinguish as two variants of one
emotion.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9" id="note-9">9.</a>
 This view of the characteristic motivation of envy is advanced in
D'Arms and Jacobson, 2000, and further developed in D'Arms and Kerr,
2008.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10" id="note-10">10.</a>
 See Smith; Smith, Parrott et al; and Ortony et al. Ben Ze'ev suggests
that envy is concerned with inferiority and desert, but urges that the
notion of desert in play is not moral.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11" id="note-11">11.</a>
 This gloss of the common supposition is intended to be neutral on the
controversy between judgmentalists, who hold that emotions essentially
involve beliefs or judgments, and their opponents. Note that evidence
for claims about the content of the appraisal involved in a given type
of emotion comes not only from beliefs a subject may be said to have,
but from desires and feelings as well. It is in part because envy is a
form of pain or distress at the rival's possession of the good that
the subject can be said to regard it as bad in some way that rival has
what he has.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12" id="note-12">12.</a>
 cf. Neu; Farrell (1980).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13" id="note-13">13.</a>
 This is Nozick's gloss of envy.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14" id="note-14">14.</a>
 cf. de Sousa on axiological mistakes.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15" id="note-15">15.</a>
 At least, this will be so if moral considerations are permitted to be
adduced in support of axiological claims. Consequentialists and others
who insist on treating the good as conceptually prior to the right
would either have to reject the relevance of the considerations
advanced above to the fittingness of envy, or find alternative,
nonmoral terms in which to express the axiological mistake
involved.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16" id="note-16">16.</a>
 The suggestion can be found in Nietszche and Freud, and arguably, as
far back as Aristotle. A comprehensive survey of historical sources is
to be found in Schoeck. It receives a sympathetic treatment in Nozick,
though he does not explicitly endorse it. See also Cooper.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17" id="note-17">17.</a>
 Some defenders of the charge appear willing to settle for something
much less contentious: that many claims of injustice on the basis of
inequality are motivated by envy. But of course, egalitarians can and
do grant that appeals to justice in ordinary life are often enough
rationalizations for envy.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18" id="note-18">18.</a>
 <em>Genealogy Treatise 1</em>. Nietzsche's notion of
&lsquo;ressentiment&rsquo; seems to be a propensity that begins life
as envy and takes on moral content only with the creation of the moral
ideals to which it gives rise.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19" id="note-19">19.</a>
 Of course, defenders of the genetic thesis may also hold the
occurrent one, and Freud at least seems to have thought them closely
connected. For Freud, emotional energies are highly labile, so that
occurrent moral resentment may be an outlet of psychic forces
springing from envy.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20" id="note-20">20.</a>
 One particularly careful effort to defend egalitarianism in this
context is Young. He points out that the charge would be more
promising if egalitarians were committed to &ldquo;levelling
down&rdquo; differences in cases where redistribution is not
available, but argues that none of the most prominent egalitarians are
so committed. For a discussion of varieties of egalitarianism, see
 <a href="../egalitarianism/index.html">egalitarianism</a>
 and
 <a href="../equality/index.html">equality</a>.</p>
 
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21" id="note-21">21.</a>
 This reply is offered by Neu and by Rawls.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22" id="note-22">22.</a>
 cf. Rawls p. 540; Ben-Ze'ev 1992.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23" id="note-23">23.</a>
 Nozick appears to deny this: &ldquo;Nor is [the claim that
egalitarianism is not motivated by envy] proven by the fact that once
people accept egalitarian principles, they might support the worsening
of their own position as an application of these general
principles.&rdquo; (p. 240). Perhaps proof is too much to hope for
here&mdash;the relevant data does seem to constitute powerful evidence
against the charge of occurrent envy. His remark is most easily
understood in defense of an ontogenetic version of the charge, yet his
surrounding discussion seems to be addressed to the occurrent
charge.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24" id="note-24">24.</a>
 The term originates in economic theory, where it has generated a vast
literature. See Foley; Varian 1974. Varian 1975 uses the idea as the
foundation for a theory of fairness, which is incisively criticized in
Sugden. Dworkin takes up the idea in his influential definition of
equality.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25" id="note-25">25.</a>
 It is easy to see that even a distribution that is not envy-free
might be one where there is no actual envy, since people can prefer
someone else's bundle of resources without envying it. Elster points
out, in addition, that an envy-free allocation does not ensure that no
one experiences envy, if an individual can envy someone else's
utility, rather than his resources. (Elster p. 179-80f.)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26" id="note-26">26.</a>
 This rationale is also somewhat problematic, since it is plausible
that one's absolute share of some primary goods, such as power, is
determined by ones relative share of other goods.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27" id="note-27">27.</a>
 See the entry on
 <a href="../justice-distributive/index.html">distributive justice</a>
 </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28" id="note-28">28.</a>
 It might be supposed that the phenomenon Rawls is concerned with is
not envy at all, then, but resentment. But the supposition that a
society is well-ordered ensures that the imagined underclass accepts
the principles of justice. They must therefore grant that there is no
complaint of justice against the better off. Yet it seems undeniable
that gross differences in distribution would likely occasion some sort
of rancorous feelings. It is tempting then to characterize the
responses as resentment that is unfitting by the subjects' own lights.
But Rawls wants to grant that such feelings are rational, if in fact
the differences are damaging to the subjects' self-esteem.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29" id="note-29">29.</a>
 Ben-Ze'ev 1992 provides references to empirical literature in support
of this claim. See also Frank.</p>

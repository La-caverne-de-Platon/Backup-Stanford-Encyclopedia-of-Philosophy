<h1>Action</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Mar 18, 2002; substantive revision Wed Apr 4, 2012</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

If a person's head moves, she may or may not have moved her head,
and, if she did move it, she may have actively performed the movement
of her head or merely, by doing something else, caused a passive
movement. And, if she performed the movement, she might have done so
intentionally or not. This short array of contrasts (and others like
them) has motivated questions about the nature, variety, and identity
of action. Beyond the matter of her moving, when the person moves her
head, she may be indicating agreement or shaking an insect off her ear.
Should we think of the consequences, conventional or causal, of
physical behavior as constituents of an action distinct from but
&lsquo;generated by&rsquo; the movement? Or should we think that there
is a single action describable in a host of ways? Also, actions, in
even the most minimal sense, seem to be essentially
&lsquo;active&rsquo;. But how can we explain what this property
amounts to and defend our wavering intuitions about which events fall
in the category of the &lsquo;active&rsquo; and which do not?</p>

<p>

Donald Davidson [1980, essay 3] asserted that an action, in some
basic sense, is something an agent does that was &lsquo;intentional
under some description,&rsquo; and many other philosophers have agreed
with him that there is a conceptual tie between genuine action, on the
one hand, and intention, on the other. However, it is tricky to
explicate the purported tie between the two concepts. First, the
concept of &lsquo;intention&rsquo; has various conceptual inflections
whose connections to one another are not at all easy to delineate, and
there have been many attempts to map the relations between intentions
for the future, acting intentionally, and acting with a certain
intention. Second, the notion that human behavior is often intentional
under one description but not under another is itself hard to pin down.
For example, as Davidson pointed out, an agent may intentionally cause
himself to trip, and the activity that caused the tripping may have
been intentional under that description while, presumably, the foreseen
but involuntary tripping behavior that it caused is not supposed to be
intentional under any heading. Nevertheless, both the tripping and its
active cause are required to make it true that the agent intentionally
caused himself to trip. Both occurrences fall equally, in that sense,
&lsquo;under&rsquo; the operative description. So further clarification
is called for.</p>

<p>

There has been a notable or notorious debate about whether the agent's
reasons in acting are causes of the action &mdash; a longstanding
debate about the character of our common sense explanations of
actions.  Some philosophers have maintained that we explain why an
agent acted as he did when we explicate how the agent's normative
reasons rendered the action intelligible in his eyes. Others have
stressed that the concept of &lsquo;an intention with which a person
acted&rsquo; has a teleological dimension that does not, in their
view, reduce to the concept of &lsquo;causal guidance by the agent's
reasons.&rsquo; But the view that reason explanations are somehow
causal explanations remains the dominant position. Finally, recent
discussions have revived interest in important questions about the
nature of intention and its distinctiveness as a mental state, and
about the norms governing rational intending.</p>

<h2><a name="NatActAge">1. The Nature of Action and Agency</a></h2>

<p>

It has been common to motivate a central question about the nature of
action by invoking an intuitive distinction between the things that
merely <em>happen</em> to people &mdash; the events they undergo
&mdash; and the various things they genuinely <em>do</em>. The latter
events, the doings, are the <em>acts</em> or <em>actions</em> of the
agent, and the problem about the nature of action is supposed to be:
what distinguishes an action from a mere happening or occurrence? For
some time now, however, there has been a better appreciation of the
vagaries of the verb &lsquo;to do&rsquo; and a livelier sense that the
question is not well framed. For instance, a person may cough, sneeze,
blink, blush, and thrash about in a seizure, and these are all things
the person has, in some minimal sense, &lsquo;done,&rsquo; although in
the usual cases, the agent will have been altogether passive
throughout these &lsquo;doings.&rsquo; It is natural to protest that
this is not the sense of &ldquo;do&rdquo; the canny philosopher of
action originally had in mind, but it is also not so easy to say just
what sense that is. Moreover, as Harry Frankfurt [1978] has pointed
out, the purposeful behavior of animals constitutes a low-level type
of &lsquo;active&rsquo; doing. When a spider walks across the table,
the spider <em>directly controls</em> the movements of his legs, and
they are directed at taking him from one location to another. Those
very movements have an aim or purpose for the spider, and hence they
are subject to a kind of teleological explanation. Similarly, the
idle, unnoticed movements of my fingers may have the goal of releasing
the candy wrapper from my grasp. All this behavioral <em>activity</em>
is &lsquo;action&rsquo; in some fairly weak sense.</p>

<p>

Nevertheless, a great deal of human action has a richer
psychological structure than this. An agent performs activity that is
directed at a goal, and commonly it is a goal the agent has adopted on
the basis of an overall practical assessment of his options and
opportunities. Moreover, it is immediately available to the agent's
awareness both that he is performing the activity in question and that
the activity is aimed by him at such-and-such a chosen end. At a still
more sophisticated conceptual level, Frankfurt [1988, 1999] has also
argued that basic issues concerning freedom of action presuppose and
give weight to a concept of &lsquo;acting on a desire with which the
agent <em>identifies</em>.&rsquo; Under Frankfurt's influence on this
point, a good deal has been written to elucidate the nature of
&lsquo;full-blooded&rsquo; human agency, whether the notion is finally
delineated either in Frankfurt's way or along different but related
lines [see Velleman 2000, essay 6, Bratman 1999, essay 10]. Thus, there
are different levels of action to be distinguished, and these include
at least the following: unconscious and/or involuntary behavior,
purposeful or goal directed activity (of Frankfurt's spider, for
instance), intentional action, and the autonomous acts or actions of
self-consciously active human agents. Each of the key concepts in these
characterizations raises some hard puzzles.</p>

<h3><a name="KnoOneOwnAct">1.1 Knowledge of one's own actions.</a></h3>

<p>

It is frequently noted that the agent has some sort of <em>immediate
awareness</em> of his physical activity and of the goals that the
activity is aimed at realizing. In this connection, Elizabeth Anscombe
[1963] spoke of &lsquo;knowledge without observation.&rsquo; The agent
knows &lsquo;without observation&rsquo; that he is performing certain
bodily movements (perhaps under some rough but non-negligible
description), and he knows &lsquo;without observation&rsquo; what
purpose(s) the behavior is meant to serve [see also Falvey 2000].
Anscombe's discussion of her claim is rich and suggestive, but her
conception of &lsquo;knowledge through observation&rsquo; is
problematic. Surely, one wants to say, proprioception and kinesthetic
sensation play some role in informing the agent of the positions and
movements of his body, and it is uncertain why these informational
roles should fail to count as modes of inner &lsquo;observation&rsquo;
of the agent's own overt physical behavior. What Anscombe explicitly
denies is that agents generally know of the positions or movements of
their own bodies by means of &lsquo;separably describable
sensations&rsquo; that serve as criteria for their judgements about the
narrowly physical performance of their bodies. However, when a person
sees that there is a goldfinch in front of him, his knowledge is not
derived as an inference from the &lsquo;separably describable&rsquo;
visual impressions he has in seeing the goldfinch, but this is an
instance of knowledge through observation nonetheless.</p>

<p>In a related vein, David Velleman [1989] describes knowledge of
one&rsquo;s present and incipient actions as &lsquo;spontaneous&rsquo;
(knowledge that the agent has achieved without deriving it from
evidence adequate to warrant it), and as &lsquo;self-fulfilling&rsquo;
(expectations of acting that tend to produce actions of the kind
expected).  For Velleman, these expectations are themselves
intentions, and they are chiefly derived by the agent through
practical reasoning about what she is to perform.  Thus, Velleman is
what Sarah Paul (2009) calls a Strong Cognitivist, i.e., someone
who <em>identifies</em> an intention with a certain pertinent belief
about what she is doing or about to do.  Setiya (2009) holds a similar
view. A Weak Cognitivist, in Paul's terminology, is a theorist that
holds that intentions to F are <em>partially constituted</em> by but
are not identical with relevant beliefs that one will <em>F</em>.  For
instance, Paul Grice (1971) held that an intention to <em>F</em>
consisted in the agent&rsquo;s &lsquo;willing&rsquo; herself
to <em>F</em> combined with a belief that she will actually F as a
more or less immediate consequence of her having so willed.  Because
Strong Cognitivists maintain that the intention/beliefs of the agent
are predominantly not based either on observation or evidence of any
sort, and because they claim in addition that these states are
causally reliable in producing actions that validate their contents,
such theorists believe that these intentions, when they have been
carried out, constitute a mode of &lsquo;practical&rsquo; knowledge
that has not been derived from observation.  Weak Cognitivists can
construct a similar story about how the agent's own actions can,
in a plausible sense, be known without relying on observation.</p>

<p> However, it is not obvious that an agent&rsquo;s knowledge of her
intentional actions is not <em>inferred</em> from immediate knowledge
of her own intentions.  Consider, to illustrate the line of thought,
Grice's theory of intention and belief.  As noted above, he held a
Weak Cognitivist view according to which an agent wills that
he <em>F</em>s and derives from his awareness of willing that he will
in fact <em>F</em> (or at least try to <em>F</em>) precisely because
he has willed to do so.  However, it seems plausible, as Sarah Paul
argues at length in her 2009, that intentions to <em>F</em>, rightly
understood, can take the place of the counterpart
&lsquo;willings&rsquo; in Grice's account.  Thus, an agent, intending
to F in the near future, and being immediately aware of so intending,
forms <em>inferentially</em> the belief that she will <em>F</em> soon
(or at least try to <em>F</em>) precisely because she has intended to
do so.  After all, the conditional,</p>

<blockquote>
  If the agent intends to <em>F</em> shortly and does not change her
  mind, then shortly she will at least try to <em>F</em>.</blockquote>

<p>
appears to be knowable <em>a priori</em>.  The belief that the agent
thereby derives is, although it is inferred, not derived from
observation.  Paul labels this the &ldquo;the inferentialist
account,&rdquo; and it is not easily ruled out.  [See also Wilson 2000
and Moran 2001.]  These puzzles about the nature of an agent's
knowledge of her own intentional actions are thus closely intertwined
with questions about the nature of intention and about the nature of
the explanation of action.  In the final section, we address briefly
some further key issues that arise in this connection.</p>

<h3><a name="GovOneOwnAct">1.2 Governance of one's own actions.</a></h3>

<p>

It is also important to the concept of &lsquo;goal directed
action&rsquo; that agents normally implement a kind of <em>direct</em>
control or guidance over their own behavior. An agent may guide her
paralyzed left arm along a certain path by using her active right arm
to shove it through the relevant trajectory. The moving of her right
arm, activated as it is by the normal exercise of her system of motor
control, is a genuine action, but the movement of her left arm is not.
That movement is merely the causal upshot of her guiding action, just
as the onset of illumination in the light bulb is the mere effect of
her action when she turned on the light. The agent has direct control
over the movement of the right arm, but not over the movement of the
left. And yet it is hardly clear what &lsquo;direct control of
behavior&rsquo; can amount to here. It does not simply mean that
behavior <em>A</em>, constituting a successful or attempted
<em>F</em>ing, was initiated and causally guided throughout its course
by a present-directed intention to be <em>F</em>ing then. Even the
externally guided movement of the paralyzed left arm would seem to
satisfy a condition of this weak sort. Alfred Mele [1992] has suggested
that the intuitive &lsquo;directness&rsquo; of the guidance of action
<em>A</em> can partially be captured by stipulating that the
action-guiding intention must trigger and sustain <em>A</em>
<em>proximally</em>. In other words, it is stipulated that the agent's
present-directed intention to be <em>F</em>ing should govern action
<em>A</em>, but not by producing some other prior or concurrent action
<em>A</em>* that causally controls <em>A</em> in turn. But the proposal
is dubious. On certain assumptions, most ordinary physical actions are
liable to flunk this strengthened requirement. The normal voluntary
movements of an agent's limbs are caused by complicated contractions of
suitable muscles, and the muscle contractions, since they are aimed at
causing the agent's limbs to move, may themselves count as causally
prior human actions. For instance, on Davidson's account of action they
will since the agent's muscle contracting is intentional under the
description &lsquo;doing something that causes the arm to move&rsquo;
[see Davidson 1980, essay 2]. Thus, the overt arm movement, in a normal
act of voluntary arm moving, <em>will</em> have been causally guided by
a prior action, the muscle contracting, and consequently the causal
guidance of the arm's movement will fail to be an instance of
&lsquo;proximal&rsquo; causation at all [see Sehon 1998].</p>

<p>

As one might imagine, this conclusion depends upon how an act of
moving a part of one's body is to be conceived. Some philosophers
maintain that the movements of an agent's body are never actions. It is
only the agent's direct <em>moving</em> of, say, his leg that
constitutes a physical action; the leg movement is merely caused by
and/or incorporated as a part of the act of moving [see Hornsby 1980].
This thesis re-opens the possibility that the causal guidance of the
moving of the agent's leg by the pertinent intention <em>is</em>
proximal after all. The intention proximally governs the moving, if not
the movement, where the act of moving is now thought to start at the
earliest, inner stage of act initiation. Still, this proposal is also
controversial. For instance, J.L. Austin [1962] held that the
statement</p>

<blockquote>(1) The agent moved his leg</blockquote>

<p>

is ambiguous between (roughly) </p>

<blockquote>(1&prime;) The agent caused his leg to move</blockquote>

<p>

and the more specific </p>

<blockquote>(1&Prime;) The agent performed a movement with his
leg.</blockquote>

<p>

If Austin is right about this, then the nominalization &ldquo;the
agent's moving of his leg&rdquo; should be correspondingly ambiguous,
with a second reading that denotes a certain leg movement, a movement
the agent has <em>performed</em>. Thus, no simple appeal to a putative
distinction between &lsquo;movement&rsquo; and &lsquo;moving&rsquo;
will easily patch up the conception of &lsquo;direct control of
action&rsquo; under present scrutiny.</p>

<p>

In any event, there is another well-known reason for doubting that
the &lsquo;directness&rsquo; of an agent's governance of his own
actions involves the condition of causal proximality &mdash; that an action
is not to be controlled by still another action of the same agent. Some
philosophers believe that the agent's moving his leg is triggered and
sustained by the agent's <em>trying</em> to move his leg in just that
way, and that the efficacious trying is itself an action [see Hornsby
1980, Ginet 1990, and O'Shaughnessy 1973, 1980]. If, in addition, the
agent's act of leg moving is distinct from the trying, then, again, the
moving of the leg has not been caused proximally by the intention. The
truth or falsity of this third assumption is linked with a wider issue
about the individuation of action that has also been the subject of
elaborate discussion.</p>

<p>

Donald Davidson [1980, essay 1], concurring with Anscombe, held
that</p>

<blockquote>(2) If a person <em>F</em>s <em>by</em> <em>G</em>ing, then
her act of <em>F</em>ing = her act of <em>G</em>ing.
 </blockquote>

<p>

In Davidson's famous example, someone alerts a burglar by
illuminating a room, which he does by turning on a light, which he does
in turn by flipping the appropriate switch. According to the
Davidson/Anscombe thesis above, the alerting of the burglar = the
illuminating of the room = the turning on of the light = the flipping
of the switch. And this is so despite the fact that the alerting of the
burglar was unintentional while the flipping of the switch, the turning
on of the light, and the illuminating of the room were intentional.
Suppose now that it is also true that the agent moved his leg
<em>by</em> trying to move his leg in just that matter. Combined with
the Davidson/Anscombe thesis about act identification, this implies
that the agent's act of moving his leg = his act of trying to move that
leg. So, perhaps the act of trying to move the leg doesn't cause the
act of moving after all, since they are just the same.</p>

<p>

The questions involved in these debates are potentially quite
confusing. First, it is important to distinguish between phrases
like</p>

<blockquote>(a) the agent's turning on the light</blockquote>

<p>

and gerundive phrases such as </p>

<blockquote>(b) the agent's turning on of the light.</blockquote>

<p>

Very roughly, the expression (a) operates more like a
&lsquo;that&rsquo; clause, viz.</p>

<blockquote>(a&prime;) that the agent turned on the light,</blockquote>

<p>

while the latter phrase appears to be a definite description,
i.e.,</p>

<blockquote>(b&prime;) the turning on of the light [performed] by the
agent.
 </blockquote>

<p>

What is more, even when this distinction has been drawn, the
denotations of the gerundive phrases often remain ambiguous, especially
when the verbs whose nominalizations appear in these phrases are
causatives. No one denies that there is an internally complex process
that is initiated by the agent's switch-flipping hand movement and that
is terminated by the light's coming on as a result. This process
includes, but is not identical with, the act that initiates it and the
event that is its culminating upshot. Nevertheless, in a suitable
conversational setting, the phrases (b) and (b&prime;) can be properly
used to designate any of the three events: the act that turned on the
light, the onset of illumination in the light, and whole process
whereby the light has come to be turned on. [For further discussion,
see Parsons 1990, Pietrofsky 2000, and Higginbotham 2000].</p>

<p>

Now, the Davidson-Anscombe thesis plainly is concerned with the
relation between the agent's <em>act</em> of turning on the light, his
<em>act</em> of flipping the switch, etc. But which configuration of
events, either prior to or contained within the extended causal process
of turning on the light, really constitutes the agent's action? Some
philosophers have favored the overt arm movement the agent performs,
some favor the extended causal process he initiates, and some prefer
the relevant event of trying that precedes and &lsquo;generates&rsquo;
the rest. It has proved difficult to argue for one choice over another
without simply begging the question against competing positions. As
noted before, Hornsby and other authors have pointed to the intuitive
truth of</p>

<blockquote>(3) The agent moved his arm <em>by</em> trying to move his
arm,</blockquote>

<p>

and they appeal to the Davidson-Anscombe thesis to argue that the act
of moving the arm = the <em>act</em> of trying to move the arm. On
this view, the act of trying &mdash; which <em>is</em> the act of
moving &mdash; causes a movement of the arm in much the same way that
an act of moving the arm causes the onset of illumination in the
light. Both the onset of illumination and the overt arm movement are
simply causal consequences of the act itself, the act of trying to
move his arm in just this way. Further, in light of the apparent
immediacy and strong first person authority of agents' judgements that
they have tried to do a certain thing, it appears that acts of trying
are intrinsically mental acts. So, a distinctive type of mental act
stands as the causal source of the bodily behavior that validates
various physical re-descriptions of the act.</p>

<p>

And yet none of this seems inevitable. It is arguable that</p>

<blockquote>(4) The agent tried to turn on the light</blockquote>

<p>

simply means, as a first approximation at least, that</p>

<blockquote>(4&prime;) The agent <em>did something</em> that was
directed at turning on the light.</blockquote>

<p>

Moreover, when (4) or (4&prime;) is true, then the something the
agent did that was directed at turning on the light will have been some
other causally prior action, the act of flipping the switch, for
example. If this is true of trying to perform basic acts (e.g., moving
one's own arm) as well as non-basic, instrumental acts, then trying to
move one's arm may be nothing more than doing something directed at
making one's arm move. In this case, the something which was done may
simply consist in the contracting of the agent's muscles. Or, perhaps,
if we focus on the classic case of the person whose arm, unknown to
her, is paralyzed, then the trying in that case (and perhaps in all)
may be nothing more than the activation of certain neural systems in
the brain. Of course, most agents are not aware <em>that</em> they are
initiating appropriate neural activity, but they are aware <em>of</em>
doing something that is meant to make their arms move. And, in point of
fact, it may well be that the something of which they are aware as a
causing of the arm movement just is the neural activity in the brain.
From this perspective, &lsquo;trying to <em>F</em>&rsquo; does not name
a natural kind of mental act that ordinarily sets off a train of
fitting physical responses. Rather, it gives us a way of describing
actions in terms of a goal aimed at in the behavior without committing
us as to whether the goal was realized or not. It also carries no
commitment,</p>

<ol type="i">
<li>concerning the intrinsic character of the behavior that was aimed
at <em>F</em>ing,</li>

<li>whether one or several acts were performed in the course of trying,
and</li>

<li>whether any further bodily effects of the trying were themselves
additional physical actions [see Cleveland 1997].</li>
</ol>

<p>

By contrast, it is a familiar doctrine that what the agent does, in
the first instance, in order to cause his arm to move is to form a
distinctive mental occurrence whose intrinsic psychological nature and
content is immediately available to introspection. The agent
<em>wills</em> his arm to move or produces a <em>volition</em> that his
arm is to move, and it is this mental willing or volition that is aimed
at causing his arm to move. Just as an attempt to turn on the light may
be constituted by the agent's flipping of the switch, so also, in
standard cases, trying to move his arm is constituted by the agent's
willing his arm to move. For traditional &lsquo;volitionalism,&rsquo;
willings, volitions, basic tryings are, in Brian O'Shaughnessy's apt
formulation, &lsquo;primitive elements of animal
 consciousness.&rsquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
 They are elements of consciousness in which
the agent has played an active role, and occurrences that normally have
the power of producing the bodily movements they represent.
Nevertheless, it is one thing to grant that, in trying to move one's
body, there is some &lsquo;inner&rsquo; activity that is meant to
initiate an envisaged bodily movement. It is quite another matter to
argue successfully that the initiating activity has the particular
mentalistic attributes that volitionalism has characteristically ascribed
to acts of willing.</p>

<p>

It is also a further question whether there is only a
<em>single</em> action, bodily or otherwise, that is performed along
the causal route that begins with trying to move and terminates with a
movement of the chosen type. One possibility, adverted to above, is
that there is a whole causal chain of <em>actions</em> that is
implicated in the performance of even the simplest physical act of
moving a part of one's body. If, for example, &lsquo;action&rsquo; is
goal-directed behavior, then the initiating neural activity, the
resulting muscle contractions, and the overt movement of the arm may
<em>all</em> be actions on their own, with each member in the line-up
causing every subsequent member, and with all of these actions causing
an eventual switch flipping somewhere further down the causal chain. On
this approach, there may be nothing which is <em>the</em> act of
flipping the switch or of turning on the light, because each causal
link is now an act which flipped the switch and (thereby) turned on the
light [see Wilson 1989]. Nevertheless, there still will be a single
<em>overt</em> action that made the switch flip, the light turn on, and
the burglar become alert, i.e., the overt movement of the agent's hand
and arm. In this sense, the proposal supports a modified version of the
Davidson/Anscombe thesis.</p>

<p>

However, all of this discussion suppresses a basic metaphysical
mystery. In the preceding two paragraphs, it has been proposed that the
neural activity, the muscle contractions, and the overt hand movements
may all be actions, while the switch's flipping on, the light's coming
on, and the burglar's becoming alert are simply happenings outside the
agent, the mere effects of the agent's overt action. As we have seen,
there is plenty of disagreement about where basic agency starts and
stops, whether within the agent's body or somewhere on its surface.
There is less disagreement that the effects of bodily movement beyond
the body, e.g., the switch's flipping on, the onset of illumination in
the room, and so on, are not, by themselves at least, purposeful
actions. Still, what could conceivably rationalize <em>any</em> set of
discriminations between action and non-action as one traces along the
pertinent complex causal chains from the initial mind or brain
activity, through the bodily behavior, to the occurrences produced in
the agent's wider environment?</p>

<p>

Perhaps, one wants to say, as suggested above, that the agent has a
certain kind of direct (motor) control over the goal-seeking behavior
of his own body. In virtue of that fundamental biological capacity, his
bodily activity, both inner and overt, is governed by him and directed
at relevant objectives. Inner physical activity causes and is aimed at
causing the overt arm movements and, in turn, those movements cause and
are aimed at causing the switch to flip, the light to go on, and the
room to become illuminated. Emphasizing considerations of this sort,
one might urge that they validate the restriction of action to events
in or at the agent's body. And yet, the stubborn fact remains that the
agent also does have a certain &lsquo;control&rsquo; over what happens
to the switch, the light, and even over the burglar's state of mind. It
is a goal for the agent of the switch's flipping on that it turn on the
light, a goal for the agent of the onset of illumination in the room
that it render the room space visible, etc. Hence, the basis of any
discrimination between minimal agency and non-active consequences
within the extended causal chains will have to rest on some special
feature of the person's guidance: the supposed &lsquo;directness&rsquo;
of the motor control, the immediacy or relative certainty of the
agent's expectations about actions vs. results, or facts concerning the
special status of the agent's living body. The earlier remarks in this
section hint at the serious difficulty of seeing how any such routes
are likely to provide a rationale for grounding the requisite
metaphysical distinction(s).</p>

<h2><a name="IntActInt">2. Intentional Action and Intention</a></h2>

<p>

Anscombe opened her monograph <em>Intention</em> by noting that the
concept of &lsquo;intention&rsquo; figures in each of the
constructions:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>(5) The agent intends to <em>G</em>;</p>

 <p>(6) The agent <em>G</em>'d intentionally; and</p>

 <p>(7) The agent <em>F</em>'d with the intention of
<em>G</em>ing,</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>

For that matter, one could add</p>

<blockquote>(7&prime;) In <em>F</em>ing (by <em>F</em>ing), the agent
intended to <em>G</em>.</blockquote>

<p>

Although (7) and (7&prime;) are closely related, they seem not to
say quite the same thing. For example, although it may be true that</p>

<blockquote>(8) Veronica mopped the kitchen then with the intention of
feeding her flamingo afterwards,</blockquote>

<p>

it normally won't be true that</p>

<blockquote>(8&prime;) In (by) mopping the kitchen, Veronica intended
to feed her flamingo afterwards.</blockquote>

<p>

Despite the differences between them, we will call instances of (7)
and (7&prime;) ascriptions of <em>intention in
 action</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup>
 These
sentential forms represent familiar, succinct ways of
<em>explaining</em> action. A specification of the intention with which
an agent acted or the intention that the agent had in acting provides a
common type of explanation of why the agent acted as he did. This
observation will be examined at some length in Section 3.</p>

<p>

Statements of form (5) are ascriptions of <em>intention for the
future</em>, although, as a special case, they include ascriptions of
<em>present-directed intentions</em>, i.e., the agent's intention to be
<em>G</em>ing <em>now</em>. Statements of form 6), ascriptions of
<em>acting intentionally</em>, bear close connections to corresponding
instances of (7). As a first approximation at least, it is plausible
that (6) is true just in case</p>

<blockquote>(6&prime;) The agent <em>G</em>'d with the intention of
(thereby) <em>G</em>ing.</blockquote>

<p>

However, several authors have questioned whether such a simple
equivalence captures the special complexities of what it is to
<em>G</em>
 intentionally.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Here is an example adapted from Davidson
[1980, essay 4]. Suppose that Betty kills Jughead, and she does so with
the intention of killing him. And yet suppose also that her intention
is realized only by a wholly unexpected accident. The bullet she fires
misses Jughead by a mile, but it dislodges a tree branch above his head
and releases a swarm of hornets that attack him and sting him until he
dies. In this case, it is at least dubious that, in this manner, Betty
has killed Jughead <em>intentionally</em>. (It is equally doubtful that
Betty killed him <em>unintentionally</em> either.) Or suppose that
Reggie wins the lottery, and having bizarre illusions about his ability
to control which ticket will win, he enters the lottery and wins it
with the intention of winning it [Mele 1997]. The first example
suggests that there needs to be some condition added to (6&prime;) that
says the agent succeeded in <em>G</em>ing in a manner sufficiently in
accordance with whatever plan she had for <em>G</em>ing as she acted.
The second suggests that the agent's success in <em>G</em>ing must
result from her competent exercise of the relevant skills, and it must
not depend too much on sheer luck, whether the luck has been foreseen
or not. Various other examples have prompted additional emendations and
qualifications [see Harman 1976].</p>

<p>

There are still more fundamental issues about intentions in action
and how they are related to intentions directed at the present and the
immediate future. In &ldquo;Actions, Reasons, and Causes,&rdquo;
Davidson seemed to suppose that ascriptions of intention in action
reduce to something like the following.</p>

<blockquote>(7*) The agent <em>F</em>'ed, and at that time he had a
pro-attitude toward <em>G</em>ing and believed that by <em>F</em>ing he
would or might promote <em>G</em>ing, and the pro-attitude in
conjunction with the means-end belief caused his <em>F</em>ing, and
together they caused it &lsquo;in the right way.&rsquo;
<br />
<br />
</blockquote>

<p>

(In Davidson's widely used phrase, the pro-attitude and associated
means-end belief constitute a <em>primary reason</em> for the agent to
<em>F</em>.) In this account of &lsquo;acting with an intention&rsquo;
there is, by design, no mention of a distinctive state of intending.
Davidson, at the time of this early paper, seemed to favor a reductive
treatment of intentions, including intentions for the future, in terms
of pro-attitudes, associated beliefs, and other potential mental causes
of action. In any case, Davidson's approach to intention in action was
distinctly at odds with the view Anscombe had adopted in
<em>Intention</em>. She stressed the fact that constructions like (7)
and (7&prime;) supply commonsense explanations of why the agent
<em>F</em>'d, and she insisted that the explanations in question do not
cite the agent's reasons as causes of the action. Thus, she implicitly
rejected anything like (7*), the causal analysis of &lsquo;acting with
a certain intention&rsquo; that Davidson apparently endorsed. On the
other hand, it was less than clear from her discussion how it is that
intentions give rise to an alternative mode of action explanation.</p>

<p>

Davidson's causal analysis is modified in his later article
&ldquo;Intending&rdquo; [1980, essay 5]. By the time of this essay, he
dropped the view that there is no primitive state of intending.
Intentions are now accepted as irreducible, and the category of
intentions is distinguished from the broad, diverse category that
includes the various pro-attitudes. In particular, he identifies
intentions for the future with the agent's all-out judgments
(evaluations) of what she is to do. Although there is some lack of
clarity about the specific character of these practical
&lsquo;all-out&rsquo; judgements, they play an important role in
Davidson's overall theory of action, particularly in his striking
account of weakness of will [1980, essay 2]. Despite his altered
outlook on intentions, however, Davidson does not give up the chief
lines of his causal account of intentions in action &mdash; of what it
is to act with a certain intention. In the modified version,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

(7**) The agent's primary reason for <em>G</em>ing must cause her,
in the right way, to intend to <em>G</em>, and her intending to
<em>G</em> must itself cause, again in the right way, the agent's
particular act of
 <em>F</em>ing.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup></p>

</blockquote>

<p>

The interpolated, albeit vague, conditions that require causation in
&lsquo;the right way&rsquo; are meant to cover well-known
counterexamples that depend upon deviant causal chains occurring
either in the course of the agent's practical reasoning or in the
execution of his intentions. Here is one familiar type of example. A
waiter intends to startle his boss by knocking over a stack of glasses
in their vicinity, but the imminent prospect of alarming his irascible
employer unsettles the waiter so badly that he involuntarily staggers
into the stack and knocks the glasses over. Despite the causal role of
the waiter's intention to knock over the glass, he doesn't do this
intentionally. In this example, where the deviant causation occurs as
part of the performance of the physical behavior itself, we have what
is known as &lsquo;primary causal deviance.&rsquo; When the deviant
causation occurs on the path between the behavior and its intended
further effects &mdash; as in the example of Betty and Jughead above
&mdash; the deviance is said to be &lsquo;secondary.&rsquo; There have
been many attempts by proponents of a causal analysis of intention in
action (&lsquo;causalists,&rsquo; in the terminology of von Wright
1971) to spell out what &lsquo;the right kind(s)&rsquo; of causation
might be, but with little agreement about their success [see Bishop
1989, Mele 1997]. Some other causalists, including Davidson, maintain
that no armchair analysis of this matter is either possible or
required.  However, most causalists agree with Davidson's later view
that the concept of &lsquo;present directed intention&rsquo; is needed
in any plausible causal account of intention in action and acting
intentionally. It is, after all, the present directed intention that
is supposed to guide causally the ongoing activity of the agent [see
also Searle 1983].</p>

<p>

The simplest version of such an account depends on what Michael
Bratman has dubbed &ldquo;the Simple View.&rdquo; This is the thesis
that proposition (6) above, [The agent <em>G</em>'d intentionally]
and, correspondingly, proposition (7) [The agent <em>F</em>ed with the
intention of <em>G</em>ing] entail that, at the time of action, the
agent intended <em>to G</em>. Surely, from the causalist point of
view, the most natural account of <em>G</em>ing intentionally is that
the action of <em>G</em>ing is governed by a present directed
intention whose content for the agent is, &ldquo;I am <em>G</em>ing
now.&rdquo; So the causalist's natural account presupposes the Simple
View, but Bratman [1984, 1987] has presented a well-known example to
show that the Simple View is false. He describes a type of case in
which the agent wants either to &phi; or to &Theta;, without having
any significant preference between the two alternatives. The agent
does know, however, that it is flatly impossible, in the given
circumstances, for him to <em>both</em> &phi; and &Theta; although, in
these same circumstances, it <em>is</em> open to him to try to &phi;
and try to &Theta; concurrently.  (Perhaps, in trying to &phi;, he
does something with one hand, and, in trying to &Theta;, he does
something with the other.) Believing that such a two-pronged strategy
of trying to achieve each goal maximizes his chances of achieving his
actual goal of either &phi;ing or &Theta;ing, the agent actively aims
at both of the subordinate ends, trying to accomplish one or the
other. The example can be spelled out in such a way that it seems
clear that the agent is wholly rational, in his actions and attitudes,
as he knowingly pursues this bifurcated attack on his disjunctive goal
(but see Yaffe 2010 for skepticism about this claim). Suppose now that
the agent actually succeeds in, say, &phi;ing and that he succeeds in
virtue of his skill and insight, and not through some silly
accident. So, the agent &phi;'s intentionally.  It follows from the
Simple View that the agent intended to &phi;.  And yet, the agent was
also doing something with the intention of &Theta;ing and had this
attempt succeeded instead (without the intervention of too much luck),
then the agent would have &Theta;'d intentionally. By a second
application of the Simple View, it follows that he also intended to
&Theta;.  And yet, just as it is irrational to intend to &phi; while
believing that it is flatly impossible for him to &phi;, so also does
it seem irrational to have an intention to &phi; <em>and</em> an
intention to &Theta;, while believing that it is flatly impossible to
do the two things together. So the agent here should be open to
criticisms of irrationality in his endeavor to &phi; or &Theta;.
Nevertheless, we observed at the outset that he is not. The only way
out is to block the conclusion that, in trying to &phi; and trying to
&Theta; in these circumstances, the agent has the contextually
irrational pair of intentions, and rejecting the Simple View is the
most direct manner of blocking that conclusion.</p>

<p>

Even if Bratman's argument defeats the Simple View [see McCann 1986,
Knobe 2006], it doesn't rule out some type of causal analysis of
acting intentionally; it doesn't even rule out such an analysis that
takes the crucial controlling cause to be an intention in every
instance. One might suppose, for example, that (i) in a Bratman case,
the agent merely intends to <em>try</em> to &phi; and intends to
<em>try</em> to &Theta;, and that (ii) it is these intentions that
drive the agent's actions [Mele 1997]. The analysis in (7**) would be
modified accordingly. However, the project of finding a workable and
non-circular emendation of (7**) remains an open question.</p>

<p>

The conceptual situation is complicated by the fact that Bratman
holds that (7) [The agent <em>F</em>'d with the intention of
<em>G</em>ing] is ambiguous between</p>

<blockquote>The agent <em>F</em>'d with the aim or goal of
<em>G</em>ing</blockquote>

<p>

and</p>

<blockquote>The agent <em>F</em>'d as part of a plan that incorporated
an intention to <em>G</em>.</blockquote>

<p>

(8) above is an especially clear example in which the second reading
is required. The second reading does entail that the agent intends to
<em>F</em>, and it is only the first that, according to Bratman's
argument, does not. Therefore, Bratman thinks that we need to
distinguish intention as an aim or goal of actions and intention as a
distinctive state of commitment to future action, a state that results
from and subsequently constrains our practical endeavors as planning
agents. It can be rational to aim at a pair of ends one knows to be
jointly unrealizable, because aiming at both may be the best way to
realize one or the other. However, it is not rational to plan on
accomplishing both of two objectives, known to be incompatible, since
intentions that figure in rational planning should agglomerate, i.e.,
should fit together in a coherent larger plan. Bratman's example and
the various critical discussions of it have stimulated interest in the
idea of the <em>rationality</em> of intentions, measured against
the backdrop of the agent's beliefs and suppositions. We discuss some
of these issues at greater length in Section 4. </p>

<p>

It has been mentioned earlier that Davidson came to identify
intentions for the future with all out judgements about what the agent
is to be doing now or should do in the relevant future. Velleman
[1989], by contrast, identifies an intention with the agent's
spontaneous belief, derived from practical reflection, which says that
he is presently doing a certain act (or that he will do such an act in
the future), and that his act is (or will be) performed precisely as a
consequence of his acceptance of this self-referential belief. Paul
Grice [1971] favored a closely related view in which intention consists
in the agent's willing that certain results ensue, combined with the
belief that they will ensue as a consequence of the particular willing
in question. Hector-Neri Casta&ntilde;eda [1975], influenced by Sellars
[1966] maintained that intentions are a special species of internal
self-command, which he calls &ldquo;practitions.&rdquo; Bratman [1987]
develops a functionalist account of intention: it is the psychological
state that plays a certain kind of characteristic causal role in our
practical reasoning, in our planning for the future, and in the
carrying out of our actions. This causal role, he argues, is distinct
from the characteristic causal or functional roles of expectations,
desires, hopes, and other attitudes about the agent's future
actions.</p>

<p>Casta&ntilde;eda's views on intention are distinctive, and they
deserve greater attention than they have recently received.  For
instance, he holds that intentions and beliefs are structurally
parallel in the following key respect.  Both involve the endorsing of
an appropriate type of structured content.  When a person believes
that <em>P</em>, she <em>endorses</em> or <em>accepts</em> the proposition that
<em>P</em>; when a person intends to <em>F</em>, she <em>endorses</em>
or <em>accepts</em> the practition, &lsquo;I [am]
to <em>F</em>.&rsquo; Roughly a practition ascribes an action property
<em>F</em> to an agent, but the ascription involves a distinctive type of
predication that essentially carries some kind of imperative force.
Orders, commands, and requests all have practitions as their contents
as well, but, as a rule, these will represent prescriptions directed
at others.  They express the content, e.g., &lsquo;You [are] to
<em>F</em>.&rsquo; An intention is, by contrast, self-directed, but it
is not only that the intended practition is self-directed in this
sense; in intending the agent conceives of himself under a
distinctively &lsquo;first person&rsquo; conception.  Other
philosophers, e.g., Hare [1971] and Kenny [1973] have likened
intentions to self-directed commands. Still others, notably Annette
Bair [1970], have wanted to construe the logical objects of intending
as non-propositional and as represented by an unmodified infinitive.
Versions of both of these ideas are worked out more carefully and
extensively in some of Casta&ntilde;eda's key writings on action.
Castaneda was concerned to assign a systematic semantics to the chief
locutions that figure in practical thinking and reasoning.  These
include ascriptions of belief and ascriptions of intention, but they
also include the varieties of &lsquo;ought&rsquo; statements that make
explicit the normative character of practical reflection.  It was a
chief ambition in his investigations to chart out the structure of
implicative relations that hold between propositions and practitions
of these varied sorts and thereby to elaborate the conceptual
foundations of deontic logic. (For a rich exegesis of Casta&ntilde;eda
on action see essay 12 in Bratman 1999.)</p>

<p>

Individuals do not always act alone. They may also share intentions
and act in concert. There has been growing interest in the philosophy
of action about how shared intention and action should be
understood. A central concern is whether the sharing of intentions
should be given a reductive account in terms of individual agency (see
Searle 1990 for an important early discussion of the issue). Michael
Bratman [1992] offers an influential proposal in a reductive vein that
makes use of his planning conception of intentions. A central
condition in his account of shared cooperative activity is that each
participant individually intends the activity and pursues it in
accordance with plans and subplans that do not conflict with those of
the other participants. But Margaret Gilbert [2000] has objected that
reductive approaches overlook the mutual obligations between
participants essential to shared activity: each participant is
obligated to the others to do his or her share of the activity, and
unilateral withdrawal constitutes a violation of this obligation.
Gilbert argues that a satisfactory account of these mutual obligations
requires that we give up reductive individualist accounts of shared
activity and posit a primitive notion of joint commitment (see also
Tuomela, 2003).</p>

<p>

Roth [2004] takes seriously the mutual obligations identified by Gilbert,
and offers an account that, while non-reductive, nevertheless invokes a
conception of intention and commitment that in some respects is
friendlier to that invoked by Bratman. It is not entirely clear
whether, in positing primitive joint commitments, Gilbert means to
commit herself to the ontological thesis that there exist group agents
over and above the constituent individual agents. Pettit [2003] defends just
such a thesis. He argues that rational group action often involves the
&ldquo;collectivizing of reason,&rdquo; with participants acting in
ways that are not rationally recommended from the participant's
individual point of view. The resulting discontinuity between
individual and collective perspectives suggests, on his view, that
groups can be rational, intentional agents distinct from their
members.</p>

<h2><a name="ExpAct">3. The Explanation of Action</a></h2>

<p>

For many years, the most intensely debated topic in the philosophy of
action concerned the explanation of intentional actions in terms of
the agent's reasons for acting. As stated previously, Davidson and
other action theorists defended the position that reason explanations
are causal explanations &mdash; explanations that cite the agent's
desires, intentions, and means-end beliefs as causes of the action
[see Goldman 1970]. These causalists about the explanation of action
were reacting against a neo-Wittgensteinian outlook that claimed
otherwise. In retrospect, the very terms in which the debate was
conducted were flawed. First, for the most part, the non-causalist
position relied chiefly on negative arguments that purported to show
that, for conceptual reasons, motivating reasons could not be causes
of action.  Davidson did a great deal to rebut these arguments. It was
difficult, moreover, to find a reasonably clear account of what sort
of non-causal explanation the neo-Wittgensteinians had in
mind. Charles Taylor, in his book <em>The Explanation of Action</em>
[1964], wound up claiming that reason explanations are grounded in a
kind of &lsquo;non-causal bringing about,&rsquo; but neither Taylor
nor anyone else ever explained how any bringing about of an event
could fail to be causal.  Second, the circumstances of the debate were
not improved by the loose behavior of the ordinary concept of &lsquo;a
cause.&rsquo; When someone says that John has cause to be offended by
Jane's truculent behavior, then &ldquo;cause&rdquo; in this setting
just means &lsquo;reason,&rsquo; and the statement, &ldquo;John was
caused to seek revenge by his anger,&rdquo; may means nothing more
than, &ldquo;John's anger was among the reasons for which he sought
revenge.&rdquo; If so, then presumably no one denies that reasons are
<em>in some sense</em> causes. In the pertinent literature, it has
been common to fall back on the qualified claim that reasons are not
&lsquo;efficient&rsquo; or &lsquo;Humean&rsquo; or
&lsquo;producing&rsquo; causes of action.  Unfortunately, the import
of these qualifications has been less than perspicuous.</p>

<p>

George Wilson [1989] and Carl Ginet [1990] follow Anscombe in
holding that reason explanations are distinctively grounded in an
agent's intentions in action. Both authors hold that ascriptions of
intention in action have the force of propositions that say <em>of</em>
a particular act of <em>F</em>ing that it was intended by its agent to
<em>G</em> (by means of <em>F</em>ing), and they claim that such <em>de
re</em> propositions constitute non-causal reason explanations of why
the agent <em>F</em>ed on the designated occasion. Wilson goes beyond
Ginet in claiming that statements of intention in action have the
meaning of</p>

<blockquote>(9) The agent's act of <em>F</em>ing was directed by him at
[the objective] of <em>G</em>ing,</blockquote>

<p>

In this analyzed form, the teleological character of ascriptions of
intention in action is made explicit. Given the goal-directed nature of
action, one can provide a familiar kind of teleological explanation of
the relevant behavior by mentioning a goal or purpose of the behavior
for the agent at the time, and this is the information (9) conveys. Or,
alternatively, when a speaker explains that</p>

<blockquote>(10) The agent <em>F</em>'d because he wanted to
<em>G</em>,</blockquote>

<p>

the agent's desire to <em>G</em> is cited in the explanation, not as
a cause of the <em>F</em>ing, but rather as indicating a desired goal
or end at which the act of <em>F</em>ing came to be directed.</p>

<p>

Most causalists will allow that reason explanations of action are
teleological but contend that teleological explanations in terms of
goals &mdash; purposive explanations in other words &mdash; are
themselves analyzable as causal explanations in which the agent's
primary reason(s) for <em>F</em>ing are specified as guiding causes of
the act of <em>F</em>ing. Therefore, just as there are causalist
analyses of what it is to do something intentionally, so there are
similar counterpart analyses of teleological explanations of goal
directed and, more narrowly, intentional action. The causalist about
teleological explanation maintains that the goal of the behavior for
the agent just is a goal the agent had at the time, one that caused
the behavior and, of course, one that caused it in the right way [for
criticism, see Sehon 1998, 2005].</p>

<p>

It has not been easy to see how these disagreements are to be
adjudicated. The claim that purposive explanations do or do not
<em>reduce</em> to suitable counterpart causal explanations is
surprisingly elusive. It is not clear, in the first place, what it is
for one form of explanation to reduce to another. Moreover, as
indicated above, Davidson himself has insisted that it is not possible
to give an explicit, reductive account of what &lsquo;the right kind
of causing&rsquo; is supposed to be and that none is
needed. Naturally, he may simply be right about this, but others have
felt that causalism about reason explanations is illicitly protected
by endemic fuzziness in the concept of &lsquo;causation of the right
kind.&rsquo; Some causalists who otherwise agree with Davidson have
accepted the demand for a more detailed and explicit account, and some
of the proposed accounts get extremely complicated. Without better
agreement about the concept of &lsquo;cause&rsquo; itself, the
prospects for a resolution of the debate do not appear
cheerful. Finally, Abraham Roth [2000] has pointed out that reasons
explanations might both be irreducibly teleological <em>and</em> also
cite primary reasons as efficient causes at the same time. It is
arguable that similar explanations, having both causal and
teleological force, figure already in specifically homeostatic
(feedback) explanations of certain biological phenomena. When we
explain that the organism <em>V</em>ed <em>because</em> it needed
<em>W</em>, we may well be explaining both that the goal of the
<em>V</em>ing was to satisfy the need for <em>W</em> <em>and</em> that
it was the need for <em>W</em> that triggered the <em>V</em>ing.</p>

<p>In a recent article, Brian McLaughlin (2012) agrees that reason
explanations are teleological, explaining an action in terms of a
purpose, goal or aim for which it was performed.  He also agrees that
these purposive explanations are not species of causal explanation.
However, he rejects the view that these same explanations are grounded
on claims about the agent's intentions in acting, and he thereby sets
aside the issues, sketched above, about purpose, intention, and their
role in rationalizations.  McLaughlin takes the following position: if
(i) an agent <em>F</em>-ed for the purpose of <em>G</em>-ing, then,
(ii) in <em>F</em>-ing, the agent was thereby trying to <em>G</em>.
To assert (i) is to offer an explanation of the action
(the <em>F</em>-ing) in terms of the agent's trying
to <em>G</em>. Moreover, if (i) is true then the act of <em>F</em>-ing
is identical with or is a proper part of the agent's attempt
to <em>G</em>.  Thus, statement (ii) offers what purports to be, in
effect, a mere redescription of the act of <em>F</em>-ing.  Assuming
Hume's maxim that if an event <em>E</em> causes an
event <em>E</em>&prime;, then <em>E</em> and <em>E</em>&prime; must be
wholly distinct, McLaughlin maintains that purposive explanations of
actions are constitutive and not causal in character.</p>

<p>
Michael Thompson has defended a position that makes a rather radical
break from the familiar post-Davidson views on the explanation of
action. He rejects as misconceived the debates between causalist and
non-causalist accounts of explaining action.  He does not deny that
actions are sometimes explained by appeal to wants, intentions, and
attempts, but he thinks that the nature of these explanations is
radically misunderstood in standard theorizing.  He thinks that
desires, intentions, and attempts are not &lsquo;propositional
attitudes,&rsquo; as they are usually understood, and the
&lsquo;sophisticated&rsquo; explanations that appeal to them are
secondary to and conceptually parasitic upon what he calls
&lsquo;na&iuml;ve action explanations.&rsquo; The na&iuml;ve
explanations are given in statements in which one action is explained
by mentioning another, e.g., &ldquo;I am breaking an egg because
I&rsquo;m making an omelet.&rdquo; It is a part of the force of these
explanations that the explanandum (the egg breaking) is present as
part of a broader, unfolding action or activity (the explanans: the
omelet making). Similarly, &ldquo;I am breaking a egg because I'm
trying to make an omelet,&rdquo; the explanans (the trying) is itself
an action, under a certain description, that incorporates the breaking
of the egg.  Kindred forms such as &lsquo;<em>A</em> is <em>F</em>-ing
because he wants to <em>G</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>A</em>
is <em>F</em>-ing because he intends to <em>G</em>&rsquo; are held to give
explanations that fall in &lsquo;the same categorical space&rsquo; as
the na&iuml;ve action explanations.  Thompson's overall position
is novel, complex, and highly nuanced.  It is sometimes elusive, and
it is certainly not easy to summarize briefly.  Nevertheless, it is a
recent approach that has rapidly been drawing growing interest and
support.</p>

<p>

One of the principal arguments that was used to show that reason
explanations of action could not be causal was the following. If the
agent's explaining reasons <em>R</em> were among the causes of his
action <em>A</em>, then there must be some universal causal law which
nomologically links the psychological factors in <em>R</em> (together
with other relevant conditions) to the <em>A</em>-type action that they
rationalize. However, it was argued, there simply are no such
psychological laws; there are no strict laws and co-ordinate conditions
that ensure that a suitable action will be the invariant product of the
combined presence of pertinent pro-attitudes, beliefs, and other
psychological states. Therefore, reasons can't be causes. In
&ldquo;Actions, Reasons, and, Causes,&rdquo; Davidson first pointed out
that the thesis that there are no reason-to-action laws is crucially
ambiguous between a stronger and a weaker reading, and he observes that
it is the stronger version that is required for the non-causalist
conclusion. The weaker reading says that there are no reason-to-action
laws in which the antecedent is formulated in terms of the
&lsquo;belief/desire/intention&rsquo; vocabulary of commonsense
psychology and the consequent is stated in terms of goal directed and
intentional action. Davidson accepted that the thesis, on this reading,
is correct, and he has continued to accept it ever since. The stronger
reading says that there are no reason-to-action laws in any guise,
including laws in which the psychological states and events are
re-described in narrowly physical terms and the actions are
re-described as bare movement. Davidson affirms that there <em>are</em>
laws of this second variety, whether we have discovered them or
 not.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Many have felt that this position only lands Davidson (<em>qua</em>
causalist) in deeper trouble. It is not simply that we suppose that
states of having certain pro-attitudes and of having corresponding
means-end beliefs are among the causes of our actions. We suppose
further that the agent did what he did because the having of the
pro-attitude and belief were states with (respectively) a conative and
a cognitive nature, and even more importantly, they are psychological
states with certain propositional contents. The specific character of
the causation of the action depended crucially on the fact that these
psychological states had &lsquo;the direction of fit&rsquo; and the
propositional contents that they did. The agent <em>F</em>'ed at a
given time, we think, because, at that time, he had a desire that
represented <em>F</em>ing, and not some other act, as worthwhile or
otherwise attractive to him.</p>

<p>

Fred Dretske [1988] gave a famous example in this connection. When the
soprano's singing of the aria shatters the glass, it will have been
facts about the acoustic properties of the singing that were relevant
to the breaking. The breaking does <em>not</em> depend upon the fact
that she was singing lyrics and that those lyrics expressed
such-and-such a content. We therefore expect that it will be the
acoustic properties, and not the &lsquo;content&rsquo; properties that
figure in the pertinent explanatory laws. In the case of action, by
contrast, we believe that the contents of the agent's attitudes
<em>are</em> causally relevant to behavior. The contents of the
agent's desires and beliefs not only help justify the action that is
performed but, according to causalists at least, they play a causal
role in determining the actions the agent was motivated to attempt. It
has been difficult to see how Davidson, rejecting laws of mental
content as he does, is in any position to accommodate the intuitive
counterfactual dependence of action on the content of the agent's
motivating reasons.  His theory seems to offer no explication
whatsoever of the fundamental role of mental content in reason
explanations. Nevertheless, it should be admitted that no one really
has a very good theory of how mental content plays its role. An
enormous amount of research has been conducted to explicate what it is
for propositional attitudes, realized as states of the nervous system,
to express propositional contents at all. Without some better
consensus on this enormous topic, we are not likely to get far on the
question of mental causation, and solid progress on the attribution of
content may still leave it murky how the contents of attitudes can be
among the causal factors that produce behavior.</p>

<p>

In a fairly early phase of the debate over the causal status of
reasons for action, Norman Malcolm [1968] and Charles Taylor [1964]
defended the thesis that ordinary reason explanations stand in
potential rivalry with the explanations of human and animal behavior
the neural sciences can be expected to provide. More recently, Jaegwon
Kim [1989] has revived this issue in a more general way, seeing the
two modes of explanation as joint instances of a Principle of
Explanatory Exclusion. That Principle tells us that, if there exist
two &lsquo;complete&rsquo; and &lsquo;independent&rsquo; explanations
of the same event or phenomenon, then one or the other of these
alternative explanations must be wrong. Influenced by Davidson, many
philosophers reject more than just reason-to-action laws. They
believe, more generally, that there are no laws that connect the
reason-giving attitudes with <em>any</em> material states, events, and
processes, under purely physical descriptions. As a consequence,
commonsense psychology is not strictly reducible to the neural
sciences, and this means that reason explanations of action and
corresponding neural explanations are, in the intended sense,
&lsquo;independent&rsquo; of one another. But, detailed causal
explanations of behavior in terms of neural factors should also be,
again in the intended sense, &lsquo;complete.&rsquo; Hence,
Explanatory Exclusion affirms that either the reason explanations or
the prospective neural explanations must be abandoned as
incorrect. Since we are not likely to renege upon our best, most
worked-out scientific accounts, it is the ultimate viability of the
reason explanations from commonsense &lsquo;vernacular&rsquo;
psychology that appear to be threatened. The issues here are
complicated and controversial &mdash; particularly issues about the
proper understanding of &lsquo;theoretical reduction.&rsquo; However,
if Explanatory Exclusion applies to reason explanations of action,
construed as causal, we have a very general incentive for searching
for a workable philosophical account of reason explanations that
construes them as non-causal. Just as certain function explanations in
biology may not reduce to, but also certainly do not compete with,
related causal explanations in molecular biology, so also non-causal
reason explanations could be expected to co-exist with neural analyses
of the causes of behavior.</p>

<h2><a name="IntRat">4. Intentions and Rationality</a></h2>

<p>

Earlier we introduced the Cognitivist view that intentions are
special kinds of beliefs, and that, consequently, practical reasoning
is a special form of theoretical reasoning. Some theorists of action
have been attracted to Cognitivism because of its promise to vindicate
Anscombe&rsquo;s (admittedly controversial) claim that, in acting
intentionally, we have knowledge of what we&rsquo;re doing that we do
not get by observation. But an opposing tradition has been at least as
equally prominent in the last twenty-five years of thinking about the
nature of intention. Philosophers in this tradition have turned their
attention to the project of giving an account of intention that
captures the fact that intentions are <em>distinctive</em> mental
states, states which play unique roles in psychological explanations
and which are subject to their own sorts of normative requirements.</p>

<p>

This project of articulating the distinctive nature of intention was
influentially undertaken in Michael Bratman&rsquo;s <em>Intention,
Plans, and Practical Reason</em> (1987), partially as a response to the
reductive view, which had once been endorsed by the early Davidson,
according to which intentions could be analyzed as complexes of beliefs
and desires. Much contemporary work on normativity and moral psychology
can be seen as flowing from Bratman&rsquo;s central (purported) insight
about the distinctive nature of intention.</p>

<p>

On the simple desire-belief model, an intention is a combination of
desire-belief states, and an action is intentional in virtue of
standing in the appropriate relation to these simpler states. For
example, to say that someone intentionally turns on the air conditioner
is just to explain her action by appealing to (e.g.) a desire to turn
on the air conditioner and a belief that moving her hand in a certain
way is a token of that type of act. It is important to note that
Bratman&rsquo;s early arguments were directed against this simple
desire-belief model of intention, and not necessarily against the model
proposed by Cognitivists. We turn in a moment to the question of to
what degree Bratman&rsquo;s theory of intention militates against the
latter view.</p>

<p>

Bratman motivated the idea that intentions are psychologically real
and not reducible to desire-belief complexes by observing that they are
motivationally distinctive, and subject to their own unique standards
of rational appraisal. First, he noted that intentions involve
characteristic kinds of motivational commitment. Intentions are conduct
controlling, in the sense that if you intend to <em>F</em> at t, and
nothing changes before t, then (other things equal) you will
<em>F</em>. The same is clearly not true for desire; we habitually
resist present-directed desires. Second, he noted that intentions
involve characteristic kinds of normative commitment (or
&ldquo;reasoning-centered commitment&rdquo;). Intentions resist
reconsideration&mdash;they are relatively stable, in the sense that we
take ourselves to be settled on a course of action when we intend it,
and it seems to be irrational to reconsider an intention absent
specific reason for doing so. In addition, intentions put pressure on
us to form further intentions in order to more efficiently coordinate
our actions. When we intend to go to the park, for example, we feel
pressure to form intentions concerning how to get there, what to bring,
etc. Again, desires do not appear to be subject to norms of
non-reconsideration, and they do not seem to put pressure on us to form
further desires about means.</p>

<p>

Bratman went on to provide a more rigorous characterization of the
constitutive norms on intention, a characterization that has been
hugely influential. The three main norms he discussed are requirements
of <em>internal consistency</em>, <em>means-end coherence</em>, and
<em>consistency with the agent&rsquo;s beliefs</em>. The applicability
of these requirements to states of intention was, for Bratman, a
further strike against the desire-belief model.</p>

<p>

The first norm requires agents to make their intentions consistent
with one another. Imagine that Mike intends to go to the game, and also
intends to refrain from going. Mike seems obviously irrational. Yet it
would be in no way irrational for Mike to desire to go to the game and
to desire to refrain from going. So it appears that the irrationality
of having inconsistent intentions cannot be explained by appealing to
run of the mill norms on desire and belief. Likewise, intentions seem
subject to a norm of means-end coherence. If Mike intends to go to the
game, and believes that he must buy a ticket in advance in order to go,
then he is obviously irrational if he does not intend to buy a ticket
(provided he persists in intending to go to the game). Again, merely
desiring to go to the game, and believing that going to the game
requires buying a ticket, would not be sufficient to render Mike
irrational in the event that he failed to desire to buy one. So again
it appears that the norms on beliefs and desires cannot suffice to
generate the norms on intentions.</p>

<p>

Finally, Bratman claimed that rational agents have intentions that
are consistent with their beliefs. The exact nature of this
intention-belief consistency norm has since been the subject of
considerable attention [Bratman 1987, Wallace 2001, Yaffe 2010]. But
the general idea is that it is irrational to intend to <em>F</em> while
also believing that one will not <em>F</em>&mdash;this would amount to
an objectionable form of inconsistency. Yet desiring to <em>F</em>
while believing that one will not <em>F</em> seems like no rational
error at all.</p>

<p>

[It should be noted that the general intuition about the
irrationality of this form of inconsistency is by no means
unassailable. As Bratman himself points out, it seems perfectly
possible, and not irrational, to intend to stop at the library without
believing that I will (recognizing, say, my own forgetful nature). If
that is correct, then it is not immediately obvious why I could not
permissibly intend to stop while also believing that I will not.] </p>

<p>

However, while Bratman&rsquo;s arguments do seem devastating for the
desire-belief view of intention, they are not necessarily as persuasive
against the Cognitivist&rsquo;s reduction of intentions to beliefs. For
example, consider again the norm of intention consistency, which
convicts Mike of error when he intends to go to the game and also
intends to refrain from going. Above we suggested that this norm could
not be explained by appealing to norms on desire, since it is
permissible to have inconsistent desires. But now imagine that the
intention to <em>F</em> just is (or necessarily involves) the belief
that one will <em>F</em>. Then intending to <em>F</em>, and intending
to refrain from <em>F</em>-ing, will entail that one has contradictory
beliefs. So if the Cognitivist can help himself to this constitutive
claim about the link between intending and believing, he appears to
have an attractive explanation of the norm requiring intention
consistency. The status of this constitutive claim, and of the
plausibility of deriving other norms (e.g. means-end coherence) from
it, is a matter of dispute (see Ross 2008). Of course, if
Bratman was right to contend that one can intend to <em>F</em> without
believing that she will <i>F</i>, then the Cognitivist picture of intention
seems doomed from the get-go.</p>

<p>

Seen in another light, then, the conclusion that intentions are
psychologically real and irreducible to simpler states may be
vindicated by way of a critique of the motivations for Cognitivism. In
this vein, some philosophers (notably Sarah Paul (2009)) have
influentially argued that the Cognitivist is committed to an
unattractive picture of the justification of intention formation. An
intention is, according to the Cognitivist, just a belief of something
like the following form: &lsquo;I will now <em>F</em>&rsquo;. But as
Paul points out, before I form an intention I typically lack sufficient
reason for thinking that I will perform the action intended&mdash;if I
have sufficient reason to believe that I will <em>F</em>, then I
needn&rsquo;t form the intention to <em>F</em> at all. It seems to
follow that intending constitutively involves forming a belief for
which I lack sufficient evidence. Indeed, it appears that the only sort
of consideration potentially counting in favor of the belief that I
will <em>F</em> is my preference that this proposition turns out true.
So intending appears to be a form of wishful thinking on the
Cognitivist picture of intentions. This can be seen as a troubling
result, given that we ordinarily regard wishful thinking as deeply
irrational and intending as perfectly rational. [It should be noted
that Velleman (1989) embraces this idea; he thinks it sufficient to
justify the rationality of intentions that they will be rationally
supported once they are in place. Paul is arguing more directly against
Setiya (2008), who does not regard Velleman&rsquo;s faith in post hoc
justification as sufficient for justifying the formation of an
intention.] Paul takes this and other problems for the Cognitivist to
establish that intentions are distinctive practical attitudes,
incapable of reduction to the theoretical attitude of belief. So
conceived, this critique of Cognitivism is continuous with
Bratman&rsquo;s critique of Davidson&rsquo;s early reductive picture of
intention.</p>

<p>

The issues about intention just canvassed are an instance of a more
general project of understanding the nature of our mental states by
understanding the normative requirements that apply to them. Just as
some philosophers attempt to illuminate the nature of belief in a way
that will be profitable for epistemology and the philosophy of mind by
making normative claims about it&mdash;for example by claiming that
belief &lsquo;aims at truth&rsquo; (Velleman 2000, Shah
2003)&mdash;many philosophers interested in agency have become
increasingly hopeful that a thorough investigation of the norms on
intentions will result in important conclusions for other
areas of inquiry. One guiding thought of Gideon Yaffe&rsquo;s ambitious
<em>Attempts</em> (2010) is precisely that an adequate account of the
normative commitments of intention will have a great deal to tell us
about how the criminal law ought to be structured.</p>

<p>

But the idea that there are distinctive norms on intention has been
challenged from another direction as well. Niko Kolodny (2005, 2007,
2008) makes the skeptical claim that we have no reason to be rational,
and one main consequence of this thought is that there are no
distinctively rational norms on our propositional attitudes at all.
(Raz (2005) argues for a similar claim, but restricts his skepticism to
what he regards as the mythical norm of means-end coherence.) We do not
have the space to present the details of Kolodny&rsquo;s arguments.
There are two main ideas: first, that all putative coherence
requirements of rationality are in fact underwritten by two
&ldquo;core&rdquo; requirements, which appeal to the rational pressure
to form and refrain from forming attitudes on the basis of our beliefs
about whether there are sufficient reasons for having those attitudes;
and second, that these core requirements are not themselves genuinely
normative. If Kolodny were correct, then the rational norms on
intention would be explicable by appeal to the same principles as the
norms on belief, and any other normatively assessable
attitudes&mdash;and would moreover be, at best, pseudo-norms, or
principles that <em>merely appear</em> normative to us. This would not
amount to a win for Cognitivism, since the explanation would turn on
underlying features of all reasoning processes, and not on any
necessary connection between the possession of intentions and beliefs.
But Kolodny&rsquo;s view might well be viewed as a threat to the idea
that inquiry into the norms on intention is a useful way to get
traction on other issues. In any event, this skeptical view about the
authority and autonomy of rationality is highly controversial, and
depends on disputed claims about reasoning and the logical form of
rational requirements (see Bridges (2009), Broome (1999, 2007),
Schroeder (2004, 2009), Finlay (2010), Brunero (2010), Shpall (2012),
Way (2010)).</p>

<p>

Finally, Richard Holton (2008, 2009) has initiated a new direction
in contemporary work on the nature of intention with his advocacy of a
novel theory of partial intentions. On his view, partial intentions are
intention-like states that figure as sub-strategies in the context of
larger, more complex plans to accomplish a given end. Such partial
intentions are, Holton thinks, necessary for adequately rich
psychological explanations: merely appealing to full intentions cannot
succeed in capturing the wide range of phenomena that intention-like
states appear to explain. And much like credential doxastic states,
partial intentions will presumably bring with them their own sets of
norms. Intuitively, having high credence that Spain will win the World
Cup places me under different commitments than believing that Spain
will win. Likewise, only partially intending to steal the cookie from
the cookie jar seems to be in some way normatively different than fully
intending to steal the cookie.</p>

<p>

There are many outstanding questions about Holton&rsquo;s account,
and about the nature of partial intentions more generally. For example,
why can&rsquo;t Holton&rsquo;s states of partial intention be analyzed
as regular intentions with conditional content? And why should we think
that there is any connection between an intention&rsquo;s being partial
and it&rsquo;s being a part of a more complex plan? If competing
accounts of partial intention result in a more unified picture of
partial attitudes is this a substantial consideration in their favor?
Consider accounts that link the notion of partial intention to the
(partial) degree to which an agent is committed to the action in
question. Such accounts have a nice story to tell about the
relationship between credential states and partial
intentions&mdash;they are species of the same genus, in the sense that
they involve not full but partial commitment to the proposition or
action in question. Thought about these
questions is still in its early stages, but is likely to shed light on
at least some of the central normative questions of interest to
philosophers of action.</p>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Moreover, proportionality is not an absolute requirement of
justice&mdash;in some contexts (though probably not parking), the
opportunity costs of achieving proportionality might be too great,
taking resources that were more urgently required elsewhere to redress
or reduce injustice.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 The appearance of a closer connection between causation and justice
may reflect the use of the same moral baseline for determining both,
i.e., the view that a disadvantage is caused by a social arrangement
if and only if it would not have existed under a morally-privileged
baseline&mdash;e.g., a state of nature or a collectivist utopia. If
causation is assessed by the latter baseline, then any disadvantage
caused by an existing social arrangement will be an injustice. But the
use of such a baseline for determining causation or justice needs to
be justified. (See
 <a href="#note-9">note 9</a>.)</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 For a distinction between several ways in which social institutions
can causally contribute to the distribution of advantage, and an
argument that these distinctions are morally relevant to the
assessment of justice claims, see Pogge 2004a,b.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 The term &ldquo;stimming&rdquo; is short for self-stimulatory
behavior, sometimes also called &ldquo;stereotypic&rdquo; behavior. In
a person with autism, stimming usually refers to specific behaviors
such as flapping, rocking, spinning, or repetition of words and
phrases.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Profound intellectual and psychiatric impairments may also pose
serious challenges for the medical model, in that many of those
impairments may be difficult to understand as biomedical dysfunction
or disease or to treat with biomedical interventions.</p>

 One case that appears to present a clear contrast involved the
installation of a ramp for a White Mountain hut in New Hampshire. The
hut was accessible only by trails that appeared too rough and steep
for wheelchair users. Proponents of the ramp did not argue for the
reconstruction of the rugged trails, but for the symbolic value of the
ramp as welcoming visitors who &ldquo;mobilized&rdquo; in varying
ways. Critics argued that given the trails&rsquo; inaccessibility, the
ramp&rsquo;s &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; was an idle, even disingenuous,
gesture of recognition. A distributive aspect was introduced, however,
when several wheelchair users reached the hut by trail, with
considerable assistance from other hikers, and availed themselves of
the ramp. Despite their achievement, it is difficult to justify the
ramp as a distributive measure, since the companions needed to help
the wheelchair users up the steep trail could surely have helped them
up the small set of steps leading to a hut, as could a high-tech
trail-mastering wheelchair. But requiring such a final effort would
have been a deficient welcome&mdash;the hut is supposed to be a place
where hikers can rest and lay down their loads, not a site for further
exertion. The ramp&rsquo;s significance as recognition, as opposed to
redistribution, might thus have been strengthened by the occasional
appearance of wheelchair users.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 It may be tempting to respond to such claims by invoking a state of
nature as a baseline for assessing which disadvantages are natural.
The thought is that if we &ldquo;subtract away&rdquo; society&rsquo;s
contribution to disadvantage, which is man-made, then we are left with
the contribution of impairment alone, which is &ldquo;natural.&rdquo;
But states of nature are artificial constructs, and the conclusions
yielded by their examination largely depend on the features built into
them. Proponents of a medical model of disability might invoke a
Hobbesian state of nature, wherein people who are missing limbs or
senses would be at a fatal disadvantage in the war of all against all.
It should be apparent that such a state of nature is not merely a
fiction, but an implausible one: any human environment contains
pervasive artifice, technology, some social order, and an implicit or
explicit system of entitlements. There is no obvious reason for
relying on a hypothetical state of affairs lacking these features as a
baseline for assessing the causal role of impairments, or the
advantages conferred on people with impairments in moving to a
political state. In contrast, some disability activists appear to
invoke an environment of limitless resources and
technologically-assisted access. Although the reliance on such an
environment as a baseline may seem utopian, it can more reasonably be
seen as a corrective for the tendency to take the present environment
as fixed or past environments as nasty and brutish (Gliedman and Roth
1980: 13&ndash;15; Wasserman 2001). Some philosophers have attempted
to make the distinction between artificial and natural disadvantages
without recourse to a state of nature (see Lippert-Rasmussen 2004 and
Nagel 1997). But in the absence of an accepted basis for making the
distinction, what counts as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; for humanity remains
a contentious normative judgment.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 A second, related, way in which distributive justice theorists have
approached social and cultural identity is as a commitment that gives
rise to inefficiencies in the conversion of resources into welfare. A
culture with elaborate traditions of celebration and gift giving may
be more expensive to maintain than one emphasizing simplicity and
austerity, though no less central to its participants&rsquo; well
being. But even if a culture is not inherently expensive, it may be
costly to sustain if only a small number or proportion of the
population participates in it (Heath 1998; Kymlicka 1989). This view
of culture is similar to the conventional view of disability in
distributive justice&mdash;an unchosen circumstance that makes it
harder to convert resources into welfare. Though culture may be more
voluntary than disability, both are subject to varying
identification&mdash;an individual may repudiate or embrace a culture,
or regard a disability as a burden to be alleviated or an identity to
be affirmed. To the extent that either is regarded as more of a choice
than a circumstance&mdash;to employ a standard distinction in
distributive justice&mdash;it might appear that its additional costs
should not be collectively borne. But to the extent that those
additional costs arise not from anything inherent in the culture or
disability, but from its minority status, there is a stronger case for
collective support&mdash;its cost is attributable to bad demographic
luck (Kymlicka 1989). In treating the disadvantages of people with
disabilities as due in significant part to their position as a
statistical minority, this view of disability has interesting
affinities with the human variation model.</p>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Appiah also notes that individual identity may have features that do
not form the basis of a collective identity and for which there is no
corresponding social category. These features may be in a sense
social, but they differ from features like race, religion, or sex in
that there are no societal expectations for how people who share those
features ought to behave. Thus, for example freelance workers are
creating group spaces to work, to give them community despite their
deliberately independent styles of work. But there are at present no
societal expectations governing their behavior. Admittedly, the line
between an individual&rsquo;s personal and the collective dimensions
of individual identity is somewhat fuzzy, but the distinction is
helpful when we move on to consider whether disability status is or
should be an aspect of individual identity.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 The sentence in the text reflects a distinction between
&ldquo;Deaf&rdquo; as a culture and &ldquo;deaf&rdquo; as a lack of
hearing.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Deaf culture necessarily lacks this enveloping and insular quality in
part because of the epidemiology of deafness: most deaf children are
raised by hearing parents, and vice-versa, and except for occasional
concentrations, (like Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard in the nineteenth
century), deaf people are geographically dispersed.</p>

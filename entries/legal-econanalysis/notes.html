<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">The Economic Analysis of Law</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 With the rise of behavioral economics, it may no longer be
appropriate to place rationality at the core of economics.
Rationality, however, still plays a central role in economics as
behavioral economics typically considers at least some actors in a
market rational. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 The economic analysis of accident law, for instance, asserts that
negligence with contributory negligence is efficient. This claim is
true in the model introduced by Brown [1973]. Negligence with
contributory negligence, however, does not obviously induce efficient
behavior in the real world in which accidents cause personal injury
and litigation is costly, not completely accurate, and rarely fully
compensatory.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 When Posner first enunciated the explanatory claim, his critics
rejected it because, as judges seemed to pay no attention to economic
efficiency in rendering judgment and announcing rules, it was
improbable that the resulting rules were, in fact, efficient. Rubin
[1977] and Priest [1977], in response, claimed that litigant selection
of cases for review led to the evolution of efficient rules. The model
in Cooter and Kornhauser [1982] questions the generality of this
result. Fernandez and Ponzetto [2010] offer a different evolutionary
account. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 One might classify the various enterprises that comprise economic
analysis of law differently. Economic analysts of law distinguish
theoretical from empirical studies. They then distinguish different
strands within each of these. So, for example, one might differentiate
the theoretical strands in terms of the nature of the theory used &ndash;
game theory, simple price theory, or behavioral economics (which
abandons one or more of the rationality postulates of neoclassical
economic theory). Similarly, one might distinguish the empirical
strands in terms of the methodology used: case study, laboratory
experiment, field experiment, or &ldquo;natural&rdquo; experiment.
These observations suggests that we might contrast neo-classical
economic analysis of law with behavioral economic analysis of law or
theoretical vs. empirical economic analysis of law. Alternatively, one
might differentiate strands in terms of the aim of the enterprise:
policy analysis, explanation or prediction.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 In many articles that explicitly address policy issues, the analyst
employs cost-benefit analysis. Cost-benefit analysis is often regarded
as an implementation of some welfarist social objective function. For
criticism of this assumption, see Kornhauser [2000].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 The intellectual geography of political economy is actually more
complex. Buchanan is a founder and exemplar of the
&ldquo;Virginia&rdquo; school of the theory of political institutions,
sometimes called &ldquo;public choice theory.&rdquo; Its evaluative
commitments are indeed contractarian. The Rochester school of the
theory of political institutions, sometimes called &ldquo;positive
political theory,&rdquo; however, has not in general rejected
welfarism. Both schools apply economic techniques to the analysis of
political institutions and both schools have influenced the economic
analysis of law. (One might differentiate them crudely in the
following way. Public choice theory fixes political institutions and
asks how the distribution of preferences within the polity affects
outcomes. Positive political theory, by contrast, fixes the
distribution of preferences within the polity and asks how
institutional design affects outcomes.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Political economic accounts of adjudication will also reject a
purposive account of adjudication. Even if a judge pursues a specific
purpose, no judge has complete control over the development of the
law. Consequently, the legal rules that evolve are unlikely to be
efficient or to further the aims of a specific individual. Nor can a
particular aim be attributed to the courts as a whole.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Institutional instrumentalism is somewhat at odds with a
contractarian evaluative position. Note that one might identify a
third type of legal instrumentalism, <em>systemic
instrumentalism</em>, in which the legal system as a whole promotes
some goal. One might understand Durkheim&rsquo;s theory of law in this
manner. On legal instrumentalism generally see Kornhauser [2000].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 An alternative account identifies the behavioral claim as the core
project. This account interprets the attention to efficiency as a
convenient way to identify and illustrate the effects of legal rules
on behavior.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>Terminology
 here is unfortunately confusing. In the policy analysis project, an
&ldquo;outcome&rdquo; refers to the <em>behavior</em> induced by the legal rule
under study not the disposition of the case. From an economic
perspective, the immediate consequences of the disposition are
distributional; it has no efficiency implication. Thus, the efficient
outcomes to which doctrinal analysis refers cannot be the dispositions
of the cases rationalized. The efficient &ldquo;outcomes&rdquo; must be the
behavior induced by the rules that rationalize the disposition or the
behavior that some model says would be induced by the rationalizing
rules.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Kraus [2007] makes the same distinction between rationalizing
outcomes and rationalizing reasons. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Felipe Jeminenz Castro, in a private communication, points out that
the focus of doctrinal analysis on dispositions is a peculiarly common
law approach to doctrine so that doctrinal analysis may be more
limited in scope than the text suggests. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Thus in the mid seventies, various authors proposed evolutionary
theories of the common law that asserted that it tended towards
efficiency.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 In the standard economic models of accident law when there is only
one active agent, for example, a negligence rule with the standard set
optimally, strict liability, and negligence rules with very high
standards of care all induce efficient behavior. But, when the agent
adopts the optimal level of care and an accident occurs, the
negligence rule with the optimal standard of care dictates a different
disposition than the other rules.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 On the other hand, some legal positivists justify the sources thesis
on the grounds that moral criteria are too controversial to serve as
an identification criterion for law. Efficiency, too, may be difficult
to apply which would argue against its use as a criterion.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 Some models in fact investigate the conditions under which such
centralized institutions emerge.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Metered parking or a free parking zone do give a permission but the
permission is often backed by a fine for violation of the terms of the
permission, e.g. failing to pay the metered fee or overstaying a time
allotment.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 In many instances,the policymaker regulates the same conduct with
multiple legal forms. One might understand this &ldquo;overregulation&rdquo; as an
attempt to balance the types of error that different forms create and
thereby refine the incentives created by the regulation.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 That is, the rule specifies an action that is not necessarily a best
response, under perfect information and costless deliberation, to the
specific situation. The rule might be an optimal response to the class
of situations, given costly deliberation and imperfect
information.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 See Raz [1994]. Raz, at times, seems to ground legal authority in
convention; such a grounding would provide a third, economic account
of authority as the analysis of convention rests on self-interest.
This argument, too, fails to provide an account of authority that
treats legal rules as exclusionary reasons. For a clear exposition of
this argument see Green [1985].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 In accident situations where the agents are symmetrically placed,
each taking due care may be in the interests of both but, in the
non-cooperative solution to this strategic situation, each would, in
the absence of a legal rule, adopt a suboptimal level of care. In the
prudential account, by contrast, it is in each agent&rsquo;s interest to
follow the rule because the costs of identifying the better action
exceed the gains from such efforts.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 Heiner [1986]. This account assumes that each judge has an interest
in &ldquo;correctly&rdquo; deciding cases. It thus assumes away the
first difficulty. Rasmusen [1994] provides an equilibrium account (see
below) of <em>stare decisis</em>, on the other hand, that relies only
on the interest of each individual judge. Rasmusen&rsquo;s theory of
<em>stare decisis</em>, though it grounds the practice in judicial
&ldquo;self-interest&rdquo; (understood as the desire to influence
policy), does not yield a rule that functions as an exclusionary
reason to follow the law.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 Rational economic agents deliberate in the sense that they update
their beliefs about the state of the world in light of the evidence
available. In fact, they deliberate rationally in the sense that they
update according to Bayes&rsquo; Rule.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 Constitutional political economy generally argues that, even at the
design phase, agents act self-interestedly. Impartiality arises not
from a shift in motivation but from the difference in the environment
so that self-interest coincides with a more impartial perspective. See
generally Brennan and Buchanan [1981, 1985] for this argument. Brennan
has subsequently rejected his earlier views in Brennan and Hamlin
[2000]. For a critique, see Kornhauser [2002].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 <em>Z</em> is pareto preferred to <em>Y</em> if and only if no one in
the population prefers <em>Y</em> to <em>Z</em> and at least one
person prefers <em>Z</em> to <em>Y</em>. Technically, the Kaldor-Hicks
criterion is not a purely welfarist criterion as it requires reference
to the underlying distribution of goods and not simply the underlying
distribution of well-being.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 Suppose agent <em>K</em> has wealth <em>w</em><sub><em>K</em></sub>
with preferences over wealth and policies representable by an indirect
utility function <i>u</i>. Let <i>P</i> be the prevailing policy and
<i>P</i>&prime; the proposed policy. Then cost benefit analysis
assigns a number <i>m</i> defined by the equation
<i>u</i>[<i>P</i>&prime;, <em>w</em><sub><em>K</em></sub>] =
<i>u</i>[<i>P</i>, <em>w</em><sub><em>K</em></sub> &minus; <i>m</i>]
where negative numbers indicate the amount one must pay <em>K</em> in
order for her to accept that state of affairs.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>
 The critique of cost-benefit analysis here is thus related to but
different from the standard critique that cost-benefit analyses depend
on the underlying distribution of income. That critique contends that
an unjust distribution would undermine the moral legitimacy of the
cost benefit analysis. The discussion in the text suggests that, even
if the underlying distribution of income and wealth were morally
acceptable, we would require additional argument to establish that the
representation of preference derived by willingness to pay would yield
interpersonally comparable measures of well-being.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 They fare no better as interpretive theories of adjudication within
civil law countries. Economic analysis of law, however, has
concentrated predominantly on the study of common law systems of
adjudication.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>
 Kaplow and Shavell [2001] offers a defense of welfarism consistent
with the characterization in the text. A more comprehensive discussion
and critique of Kaplow and Shavell&rsquo;s argument is provided in
Kornhauser [2003].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>
 Fleurbaey, Tungodden and Chang [2003] argue against the claim that
the Pareto criterion is incompatible with non-welfarist criteria.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-31">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a>
 Kaplow and Shavell [2002] acknowledge this distinction. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-32">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-32">32.</a>
 The strategy of incorporation in some sense confuses the direction of
causation. An agent&rsquo;s well-being depends on the proper resolution of
the moral conflict rather than the aggregation of well-being
determining the proper resolution of the conflict.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-33">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-33">33.</a>
 This claim does not rely on a cognitive view of morality. Even
expressivists such as Gibbard [1990] and Blackburn [1998] acknowledge
that moral assertions are not personal and that the individual has no
sovereignty over them. For a fuller discussion, see Kornhauser
[2003].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-34">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-34">34.</a>
 In some contexts of course majority rule is used to resolve conflict
in belief but we defend this aggregation method in a different way.
Compare the defense of majority rule in jury decisions to its defense
in interest group theories of politics.</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">William of Ockham</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 For an account of
Ockham's life, including a discussion of how these dates are calculated
in Ockham's case, see Wood [1997], Chap. 1. For further details of
Ockham's life, see Courtenay [1999].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Earlier
biographies generally put the date in 1285, but scholars now put it
later. The modern English spelling of the village's name is
&lsquo;Ockham&rsquo;, although because of the distinguished prominence
of several French medievalists early in the twentieth century, one
still occasionally sees the spelling &lsquo;Occam&rsquo;. One also
sometimes sees his name without the &lsquo;of&rsquo;, treating
&lsquo;Ockham&rsquo; as a surname rather than a place name. See, e.g.,
the title of Adams [1987].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 By this time Latin was virtually no one's native language. Ockham's
first language was probably Middle English. Latin was
exclusively a second language that lived primarily in very specialized
and artificial contexts: academic, ecclesiastical, legal,
diplomatic. This fact suggests that it is probably wrong to look for
&ldquo;ordinary language&rdquo; considerations in the Latin
philosophical writings of this period, whether by Ockham or anyone
else.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 The technical
term is <em>&lsquo;oblatus&rsquo;</em> (&ldquo;offered&rdquo;); Ockham
was an &ldquo;oblate.&rdquo; Although this perhaps sounds shocking to
us, like giving away one's children, in fact the practice was quite
common and amounted to little more than sending one's child to boarding
school. Various religious schools would often take in children from the
surrounding area, educate them, feed and house them. The children were
not necessarily expected to pursue a religious vocation later in life,
although many of them did. For families that were not especially
wealthy, this practice was a good way to educate their children.
Moreover, it offered the possibility of social mobility, since the
Church was probably the only institution of the day where it was
possible to advance on the basis of hard work and one's own native
talent, regardless of social origins. (Even for wealthy families, the
practice provided a good solution to the problem posed by
primogeniture: what to do with the <em>second</em> son.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Ockham's accuser
may have been John Lutterell, who had been Chancellor at the University
of Oxford for a while. Recall that the Papacy at this time, together
with all the offices and bureaucracy that went with it, was
 not located in Rome, but at Avignon, a moderate-sized town in
southeastern France, on the Rhone River. It was there between 1309 and
1377.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 It is not certain
that Ockham had ever actually been ordered to stay in Avignon. Michael
of Cesena later on claimed that this was an utter fabrication (Wood
[1997], p. 10 n. 21). Note that Ockham was excommunicated for his
<em>actions</em>, not for his views.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 With the possible
exception of two short works on logic&mdash;<em>Lesser Treatise on
Logic</em> (<em>Tractatus minor logicae</em>) and <em>Primer of
Logic</em> (<em>Elementarium logicae</em>)&mdash;the authenticity of
which has been questioned.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 One still often
sees it stated that Ockham died in 1349. But G&aacute;l [1982]
convincingly establishes the correct date as 1347.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 There are two
doubtful exceptions, the <em>Lesser Treatise on Logic</em> and the
<em>Primer of Logic,</em> which appear to be late and may not be
authentic. See
 <a href="#note-7">note 7</a>
 above.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 A
list of Ockham's works, with information on modern editions and English
translations, can be found in Spade [1999], pp. 4-11. References below
to the works will be made using the titles, abbreviations, internal
divisions and other conventions specified in Spade [1999], xv-xvii. The
<em>Dialogue</em> is being published in an on-line web edition and
English translation by the British Academy, available at
 <a href="http://www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/dialogus/ockdial.html" target="other">www.britac.ac.uk/pubs/dialogus/ockdial.html</a>
(in progress).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Ockham's
treatment of <em>insolubilia</em> (paradoxes like the Liar Paradox),
for instance, appears to be greatly inspired by Walter Burley (Spade
[1974]), and his account of the semantics of relative pronouns as well
as the machinery (although not the underlying semantics) of his theory
of supposition are likewise derived from Burley (Brown [1972]).
Important details of his theory of truth conditions for tensed and
modal propositions likewise already appear in Burley, although this may
reflect more a &ldquo;British,&rdquo; as distinct from a
&ldquo;Continental,&rdquo; way of formulating these conditions (Spade
[1980], section III, pp. 13-22).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 For example,
his theory of topical &ldquo;middles&rdquo; and their role in his
theory of consequence. See Normore [1999], p. 46.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 In medieval
terminology, &ldquo;hypothetical&rdquo; propositions included more than
conditionals. The distinction between categorical and hypothetical
propositions is approximately the same as the modern distinction
between atomic and molecular propositions&mdash;with one important
difference: the negation of an atomic proposition is molecular, whereas
the negation of a categorical proposition is still categorical, not
hypothetical. A hypothetical proposition requires two or more
categorical components.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Ockham's
treatment of modal syllogistic is fuller and more complete than any of his
predecessors', and is a significant achievement. See Normore [1999], p.
33.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 This notion of signification is ultimately derived from Aristotle,
<em>On Interpretation</em> 3, 16<sup>b</sup>19-21, and especially from
Augustine, <em>De doctrina christiana</em>, II, 1.1.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 See Spade
[1975a] for a discussion of the implications of this.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 This way of
putting the matter suggests that Ockham sees no problem with referring
to presently non-existing objects by means of demonstratives. But the secondary
literature is not agreed on this. See Normore [1975] and Karger
[1976].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>  This first
 approximation is not strictly correct, but will serve as a
 start. In fact, matters are greatly complicated by considerations
 that go beyond the scope of this article. For a discussion, see Spade
 [1975] and Panaccio [2004], Chap. 4. See also the discussion of mental language
 in <a href="index-2.html#MentLangConnDefi">Section 3.3</a> below.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 This ignores
a prior division Ockham and others make, between &ldquo;proper&rdquo;
and &ldquo;improper&rdquo; supposition. Improper supposition is in
effect metaphorical or figurative reference. Medieval semantics did not
have a good theory of metaphor, so that this part of supposition theory
remained undeveloped, by Ockham and others, beyond a few sketchy
remarks. Ockham's three main kinds of supposition were not original,
and were in fact fairly standard among medieval logicians, although his
way of defining them reflects peculiarities of his own theory of
signification. The origins of supposition theory are not yet well
understood, although the terminology of &ldquo;personal&rdquo;
supposition suggests that it had something to do with theological
considerations about &ldquo;person&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;nature&rdquo; in
Trinitarian and Christological theory.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Note that the
subject of &lsquo;Every dog is a mammal&rsquo; and of &lsquo;Dog has
three letters&rsquo; is (apart from the quantifier in the former)
exactly the same term. Medieval logic did not have quotation mark
conventions, which were not regularly used until after the invention of
printing, and the theory of material supposition provided a substitute
for them. But material supposition had other uses that cannot be easily
handled by quotation marks. For example, in &lsquo;It is possible for
him to run&rsquo;, according to Ockham and many other medieval
logicians, the expression &lsquo;for him to run&rsquo; has material
supposition not for itself but for the proposition &lsquo;He
runs&rsquo; or &lsquo;He is running&rsquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>

of these claims, see Spade [1988].</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>  On the history of the
idea of mental language up to the time of Ockham, see Panaccio
[1999].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>  The respective role
of causality and similarity with respect to natural signification in
Ockham has been a somewhat controversial issue in recent secondary
literature. See e.g. Adams [1987], Chap. 4, Panaccio [2004], Chap. 7,
and [2015].</p>
</div>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>  For details of the
following discussion, see Spade [1975], Panaccio [1990] and [2004],
Chap. 4-6.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 For example,
proper names of individuals and the names of the Aristotelian
categories. The reasons for these exceptions need not detain us
here.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 This tells us
that the real definitions of absolute terms will be complex
<em>connotative</em> expressions.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>  This holds at any
rate within mental language. In conventional languages, there can in
principle be several variants of a given nominal definition insofar as
a simple term can legitimately be substituted for a synonymous one
within a spoken or written nominal definition. This, however, does not
happen in mental language since there is no plurality of synonyms
among simple concepts according to Ockham.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>  The phrase
&ldquo;endowed with&rdquo; in the example must not be taken to refer
to special things: it is what Ockham calls a &lsquo;syncategorematic
term&rsquo;, the function of which is merely to connect in the right
way the referring terms (or categorematic terms) with each others.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">

 In addition to the <em>Exposition</em> and the <em>Questions on
Aristotle's Book of the Physics</em>, cited
 <a href="index-2.html#physicalwritings">earlier</a>,
 Ockham wrote:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Brief Summa of the Physics</em>,</li>

<li><em>Little Summa of Natural Philosophy</em>,</li>
</ul>

<p>

plus occasional treatises:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>On the Eternity of the World</em> (considered a problem of
natural philosophy as well as of theology),</li>

<li><em>On Final Causality</em>,</li>

<li><em>On the Mirror and Its Object</em>,</li>

<li><em>On the Agent Intellect</em> and <em>On the Possible Intellect
according to Averroes</em>. These were considered topics in natural
philosophy,</li>

<li><em>Treatise on Quantity</em> and <em>On the Body of Christ</em>.
These two works are about the Eucharist, but devote a great deal of
discussion to the natural philosophy underlying the doctrine of the
Eucharist, particularly questions about the category of
quantity.</li>

</ul>

<p>

In addition, there is much material relevant to natural philosophy
in the <em>Quodlibets</em> and in the <em>Commentary on the
Sentences.</em></p>

 Translated in
Boehner [1990], Chap. 1. Ockham also treats this question in
<em>Sent.</em> I, d. 2, q. 4, translated in Spade [1994], pp. 114-48,
where he is arguing against Walter Burley, who explicitly held that one
reason we need universals in our ontology is to make science (in the
Aristotelian sense) possible.</p>

&lsquo;Species&rsquo; in this sense should not be confused with species
as opposed to genus. In the present usage, &lsquo;species&rsquo; means
something like &ldquo;appearance.&rdquo; English preserves traces of
this meaning in our term &lsquo;specious&rsquo;.</p>

 That last
step is the difficult one, and the one over the details of which
medieval authors disagree the most. It goes without saying that many
details of the epistemological story are omitted from this quick
sketch.</p>

 cognition, see Karger [1999], Panaccio [2004], Chap. 1, and Panaccio [2014]. Much has been written, on the other
 hand, about Ockham's distinctive thesis about the (supernatural)
 possibility of intuiting <em>non-existing</em> beings (in which case
 the relevant intuitive cognition would cause, he thinks,
 the <em>true</em> judgement that the intuited thing does <em>not</em>
 exist); see in particular Panaccio and Pich&eacute; [2010].</p>

 This remark
needs to be carefully qualified, since Aquinas's moral psychology is
very subtle. But this is not the place to do it.</p>

 Duns Scotus
allowed that we can choose not to act toward our ultimate good; but he
did not think we can knowingly choose to act directly <em>against</em>
it. For a discussion of Aquinas, Scotus, Ockham and others on these
issues, see Adams [1999].</p>

 McGrade
[1999] argues that this difference does not represent a real change of
mind on Ockham's part, but instead only a shift of emphasis. See

 Note that the
Franciscan ideal of poverty did not imply that there was anything
morally wrong with property, that property was evil, either
individually or collectively. Poverty was not a duty but a
&ldquo;counsel of perfection.&rdquo; That is, it is perfectly
acceptable to own property, but it is better&mdash;more
perfect&mdash;not to have any. St. Francis seems to have wanted his
friars not just to do their duty, but to go beyond that and be
<em>perfect</em> as far as possible. The issue was not, therefore,
strictly a moral one.</p>

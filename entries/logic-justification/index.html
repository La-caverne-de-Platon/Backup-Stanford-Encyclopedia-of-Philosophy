You may say, &ldquo;I know that Abraham Lincoln was a tall man. 
&rdquo; In turn you may be asked how you know. You would almost 
certainly not reply semantically, Hintikka-style, that Abraham 
Lincoln was tall in all situations compatible with your knowledge. 
Instead you would more likely say, &ldquo;I read about Abraham 
Lincoln&rsquo;s height in several books, and I have seen photographs of him
next to other people. &rdquo; One certifies knowledge by providing a 
reason, a justification. Hintikka semantics captures knowledge as 
true belief. Justification logics supply the missing third component 
of Plato&rsquo;s characterization of knowledge as <em>justified</em> true 
belief.</p>

<h2><a id="WhyJusLog">1. Why Justification Logic?</a></h2>

<p>

Justification logics are epistemic logics which allow knowledge and 
belief modalities to be &lsquo;unfolded&rsquo; into <em>justification
terms</em>: instead of \(\Box X\) one writes 
\(t : X\), and reads it as &ldquo;\(X\) is justified
by reason \(t\)&rdquo;. One may think of traditional modal 
operators as <em>implicit</em> modalities, and justification terms as
their <em>explicit</em> elaborations which supplement modal logics 
with finer-grained epistemic machinery. The family of justification 
terms has structure and operations. Choice of operations gives rise 
to different justification logics. For all common epistemic logics 
their modalities can be completely unfolded into explicit 
justification form. In this respect Justification Logic reveals and 
uses the explicit, but hidden, content of traditional Epistemic Modal
Logic.</p>

<p>

Justification logic originated as part of a successful project to 
provide a constructive semantics for intuitionistic 
logic&mdash;justification terms abstracted away all but the most 
basic features of mathematical proofs. Proofs are justifications in 
perhaps their purest form. Subsequently justification logics were 
introduced into formal epistemology.
This article presents the general range of justification logics as 
currently understood. It discusses their relationships with 
conventional modal logics. In addition to technical machinery, the 
article examines in what way the use of explicit justification terms 
sheds light on a number of traditional philosophical problems. The 
subject as a whole is still under active development.</p>

<p>

The roots of justification logic can be traced back to many different
sources, two of which are discussed in detail: epistemology and 
mathematical logic.</p>

<h3><a id="EpiTra">1.1 Epistemic Tradition</a></h3>

<p>

The properties of knowledge and belief have been a subject for formal
logic at least since von Wright and Hintikka, (Hintikka 1962, von 
Wright 1951). Knowledge and belief are both treated as modalities in 
a way that is now very familiar&mdash;<em>Epistemic Logic</em>. But 
of Plato&rsquo;s three criteria for knowledge, <em>justified, true, 
belief</em>, (Gettier 1963, Hendricks 2005), epistemic logic really 
works with only two of them. Possible worlds and indistinguishability
model belief&mdash;one believes what is so under all circumstances 
thought possible. Factivity brings a trueness component into 
play&mdash;if something is not so in the actual world it cannot be 
known, only believed. But there is no representation for the 
justification condition. Nonetheless, the modal approach has been 
remarkably successful in permitting the development of a rich 
mathematical theory and applications, (Fagin, Halpern, Moses, and 
Vardi 1995, van Ditmarsch, van der Hoek, and Kooi 2007). Still, it is
not the whole picture.</p>

<p>

The modal approach to the logic of knowledge is, in a sense, built 
around the universal quantifier: \(X\) is known in a situation 
if \(X\) is true in <em>all</em> situations indistinguishable 
from that one. Justifications, on the other hand, bring an 
existential quantifier into the picture: \(X\) is known in a 
situation if <em>there exists</em> a justification for \(X\) in 
that situation. This universal/existential dichotomy is a familiar 
one to logicians&mdash;in formal logics there exists a proof for a 
formula \(X\) if and only if \(X\) is true in all models 
for the logic. One thinks of models as inherently non-constructive, 
and proofs as constructive things. One will not go far wrong in 
thinking of justifications in general as much like mathematical 
proofs. Indeed, the first justification logic was explicitly designed
to capture mathematical proofs in arithmetic, something which will be
discussed further in Section 1.2.</p>

<p>

In Justification Logic, in addition to the category of formulas, 
there is a second category of <em>justifications</em>. Justifications
are formal terms, built up from constants and variables using various
operation symbols. Constants represent justifications for commonly 
accepted truths&mdash;typically axioms. Variables denote unspecified 
justifications. Different justification logics differ on which 
operations are allowed (and also in other ways too). If \(t\) is
a justification term and \(X\) is a formula, 
\(t : X\) is a formula, and is intended to be read:</p>

<p class="indent">
  \(t\) is a justification for X.
</p>

<p>

One operation, common to all justification logics, is 
<em>application</em>, written like multiplication. The idea is, if 
\(s\) is a justification for \(A \rightarrow B\) and 
\(t\) is a justification for \(A\), then 
[\(s\cdot t\)] is a justification for 
 \(B\)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>.
 That is, the validity of the following is generally assumed:</p>

\[\tag{1}
s :( A \rightarrow B ) \rightarrow ( t : A \rightarrow [ s\cdot t ]: B).
\]

<p>

This is the explicit version of the usual distributivity of knowledge
operators, and modal operators generally, across implication:</p>

\[\tag{2}
\Box ( A \rightarrow B ) \rightarrow ( \Box A \rightarrow \Box B).
\]

<p>

In fact, formula (2) is behind many of the problems of <em>logical 
omniscience</em>. It asserts that an agent knows everything that is 
implied by the agent&rsquo;s knowledge&mdash;knowledge is closed under 
consequence. While knowable-in-principle, knowability, is closed 
under consequence, the same cannot be said for any plausible version 
of actual knowledge. The distinction between (1) and (2) can be 
exploited in a discussion of the paradigmatic Red Barn Example of 
Goldman and Kripke; here is a simplified version of the story taken 
from (Dretske 2005).</p>

<blockquote>
  Suppose I am driving through a neighborhood in which, unbeknownst to
  me, papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; barns are scattered, and I see that
  the object in front of me is a barn. Because I have barn-before-me
  percepts, I believe that the object in front of me is a barn. Our
  intuitions suggest that I fail to know barn. But now suppose that
  the neighborhood has no fake red barns, and I also notice that the
  object in front of me is red, so I know a red barn is there. This
  juxtaposition, being a red barn, which I know, entails there being a
  barn, which I do not, &ldquo;is an embarrassment&rdquo;.
</blockquote>

<p>

In the first formalization of the Red Barn Example, logical 
derivation will be performed in a basic modal logic in which \(\Box\)  
is interpreted as the &lsquo;belief&rsquo; modality. Then some of the
occurrences of \(\Box\)  will be externally interpreted as 
&lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; according to the problem&rsquo;s description. Let 
\(B\) be the sentence &lsquo;the object in front of me is a 
barn&rsquo;, and let \(R\) be the sentence &lsquo;the object in 
front of me is red&rsquo;.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    \(\Box B\), &lsquo;I believe that the object in front of
    me is a barn&rsquo;;
  </li>
  <li>
    \(\Box ( B \wedge R)\), &lsquo;I believe that the
    object in front of me is a red barn&rsquo;.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>

At the metalevel, 2 is actually knowledge, whereas by the problem 
description, 1 is not knowledge.</p>

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    \(\Box ( B \wedge R \rightarrow B)\), a
    knowledge assertion of a logical axiom.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>

Within this formalization, it appears that epistemic closure in its
modal form (2) is violated: line 2, \(\Box ( B \wedge R )\), and line
3, \(\Box ( B \wedge R \rightarrow B)\) are cases of knowledge whereas
\(\Box B\) (line 1) is not knowledge. The modal language here does not
seem to help resolving this issue.</p>

<p>

Next consider the Red Barn Example in Justification Logic where 
\(t : F\) is interpreted as &lsquo;I 
<strong>believe</strong> \(F\) for reason \(t\)&rsquo;. Let \(u\) be a
specific individual justification for belief that \(B\), and \(v\),
for belief that \(B \wedge R\). In addition, let \(a\) be a
justification for the logical truth \(B \wedge R \rightarrow B\). Then
the list of assumptions is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    \(u : B\), &lsquo;\(u\) is a reason to believe
    that the object in front of me is a barn&rsquo;;
  </li>
  <li>
    \(v :( B \wedge R)\), &lsquo;\(v\) is a
    reason to believe that the object in front of me is a red
    barn&rsquo;;
  </li>
  <li>
    \(a :( B \wedge R \rightarrow B)\).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>

On the metalevel, the problem description states that 2 and 3 are 
cases of knowledge, and not merely belief, whereas 1 is belief which 
is not knowledge. Here is how the formal reasoning goes:</p>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    \(a :( B \wedge R \rightarrow B ) \rightarrow ( v :( B \wedge R )
    \rightarrow [ a\cdot v ]: B)\), by principle (1);
  </li>
  <li>
    \(v :( B \wedge R ) \rightarrow [ a \cdot v ]: B\), from 3 and 4, by propositional
    logic;
  </li>
  <li>
    [\(a\cdot v ]: B\), from 2 and 5, by
    propositional logic.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>

Notice that conclusion 6 is [\(a\cdot v ]: B\), 
and not \(u : B\) ; epistemic closure holds. By reasoning
in justification logic it was concluded that 
[\(a\cdot v ]: B\) is a case of knowledge, i.e.,
&lsquo;I know \(B\) for reason 
\(a\cdot v\)&rsquo;. The fact that 
\(u : B\) is not a case of knowledge does not spoil the 
closure principle, since the latter claims knowledge specifically for
[\(a\cdot v ]: B\). Hence after observing a red 
fa&ccedil;ade, I indeed know \(B\), but this knowledge has 
nothing to do with 1, which remains a case of belief rather than of 
knowledge. The justification logic formalization represents the 
situation fairly.</p>

<p>

Tracking justifications represents the structure of the Red Barn 
Example in a way that is not captured by traditional epistemic modal 
tools. The Justification Logic formalization models what seems to be 
happening in such a case; closure of knowledge under logical 
entailment is maintained even though &lsquo;barn&rsquo; is not 
perceptually 
 known.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>

<h3><a id="MatLogTra">1.2 Mathematical Logic Tradition</a></h3>

<p>

According to Brouwer, truth in constructive (intuitionistic) 
mathematics means the existence of a proof, cf. (Troelstra and van 
Dalen 1988). In 1931&ndash;34, Heyting and Kolmogorov gave an 
informal description of the intended proof-based semantics for 
intuitionistic logic (Kolmogorov 1932, Heyting 1934), which is now 
referred to as the <em>Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov (BHK) 
semantics</em>. According to the BHK conditions, a formula is 
&lsquo;true&rsquo; if it has a proof. Furthermore, a proof of a 
compound statement is connected to proofs of its components in the 
following way:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    a proof of \(A \wedge B\) consists of a proof of
    proposition \(A\) and a proof of proposition \(B\);
  </li>
  <li>
    a proof of \(A \vee B\) is given by presenting either
    a proof of \(A\) or a proof of \(B\);
  </li>
  <li>
    a proof of \(A \rightarrow B\) is a construction
    transforming proofs of \(A\) into proofs of \(B\);
  </li>
  <li>
    falsehood \(\bot\)  is a proposition which has no proof,
    \(\neg A\) is shorthand for \(A \rightarrow \bot\) .
  </li>
</ul>

<p>

Kolmogorov explicitly suggested that the proof-like objects in his 
interpretation (&ldquo;problem solutions&rdquo;) came from classical 
mathematics (Kolmogorov 1932). Indeed, from a foundational point of 
view it does not make much sense to understand the 
&lsquo;proofs&rsquo; above as proofs in an intuitionistic system 
which these conditions are supposed to be specifying.</p>

<p>

The fundamental value of the BHK semantics is that informally but 
unambiguously it suggests treating justifications, here mathematical 
proofs, as objects with operations.</p>

<p>

In (G&ouml;del 1933), G&ouml;del took the first step towards 
developing a rigorous proof-based semantics for intuitionism. 
G&ouml;del considered the classical modal logic
 \(\mathsf{S4}\)
 to be a calculus describing 
properties of provability:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Axioms and rules of classical propositional logic;
  </li>
  <li>
    \(\Box ( F \rightarrow G ) \rightarrow ( \Box F \rightarrow \Box G)\);
  </li>
  <li>
    \(\Box F \rightarrow F\);
  </li>
  <li>
    \(\Box F \rightarrow \Box \Box F\);
  </li>
  <li>
    Rule of necessitation: if \(\vdash F\), then
    \(\vdash \Box F\).

    </li>
</ul>

<p>

Based on Brouwer&rsquo;s understanding of logical truth as provability, 
G&ouml;del defined a translation tr\((F)\) of the propositional 
formula \(F\) in the intuitionistic language into the language 
of classical modal logic: tr\((F)\) is obtained by prefixing 
every subformula of \(F\) with the provability modality \(\Box\).
Informally speaking, when the usual procedure of determining 
classical truth of a formula is applied to tr\((F)\), it will 
test the provability (not the truth) of each of \(F\)&rsquo;s 
subformulas, in agreement with Brouwer&rsquo;s ideas. From G&ouml;del&rsquo;s 
results and the McKinsey-Tarski work on topological semantics for 
modal logic, it follows that the translation tr\((F)\) provides 
a proper embedding of the Intuitionistic Propositional Calculus, 
\(\mathsf{IPC}\), into
 \(\mathsf{S4}\), i.e., an embedding of 
intuitionistic logic into classical logic extended by the provability
operator.</p>

\[\tag{3}
\text{If } \mathsf{IPC} \text{ proves } F, 
 \text{ then } \mathsf{S4} \text{ proves tr}(F).
\]

<p>

Still, G&ouml;del&rsquo;s original goal of defining intuitionistic
logic in terms of classical provability was not reached, since the
connection of \(\mathsf{S4}\) to the usual mathematical notion of
provability was not established. Moreover, G&ouml;del noted that the
straightforward idea of interpreting modality \(\Box F\) as <em>F is
provable in a given formal system T</em> contradicted
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s second incompleteness theorem. Indeed, \(\Box (
\Box F \rightarrow F)\) can be derived in \(\mathsf{S4}\) by the rule
of necessitation from the axiom \(\Box F \rightarrow F\). On the other
hand, interpreting modality \(\Box\) as the predicate of formal
provability in theory \(T\) and \(F\) as contradiction, converts this
formula into a false statement that the consistency of \(T\) is
internally provable in \(T\).</p>

<p>

The situation after (G&ouml;del 1933) can be described by the 
following figure where &lsquo;\(X \hookrightarrow Y\)&rsquo;
 should be read as &lsquo;\(X\) is interpreted in 
\(Y\)&rsquo;</p>

\[
\mathsf{IPC} \hookrightarrow \mathsf{S4} \hookrightarrow ? \hookrightarrow
 \textit{CLASSICAL PROOFS}
\]

<p>

In a public lecture in Vienna in 1938, G&ouml;del observed that using
the format of explicit proofs:</p>

\[\tag{4}
t \text{ is a proof of } F.
\]

<p>

can help in interpreting his provability calculus
 \(\mathsf{S4}\) (G&ouml;del 1938). Unfortunately, 
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s work (G&ouml;del 1938) remained unpublished until 1995, 
by which time the G&ouml;delian logic of explicit proofs had already 
been rediscovered, and axiomatized as the Logic of Proofs
 \(\mathsf{LP}\) and supplied with 
completeness theorems connecting it to both
 \(\mathsf{S4}\)
 and classical proofs (Artemov 1995).</p>

<p>

The Logic of Proofs
 \(\mathsf{LP}\)
 became the first in the Justification Logic 
family. Proof terms in
 \(\mathsf{LP}\)
 are nothing but BHK terms understood as 
classical proofs. With
 \(\mathsf{LP}\),
 propositional intuitionistic logic received 
the desired rigorous BHK semantics:</p>

\[
\mathsf{IPC} \hookrightarrow \mathsf{S4} \hookrightarrow \mathsf{LP}
 \hookrightarrow \textit{CLASSICAL PROOFS} \]

<h2><a id="Hyp">1.3 Hyperintensionality</a></h2>

<p>The <span><em>hyperintensional paradox</em></span> was formulated by Cresswell in 1975.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is well known that it seems possible to have a situation in
which there are two propositions \(p\) and \(q\) which are logically
equivalent and yet are such that a person may believe the one but not
the other. If we regard a proposition as a set of possible worlds then
two logically equivalent propositions will be identical, and so if
&lsquo;\(x\) believes that&rsquo; is a genuine sentential functor, the
situation described in the opening sentence could not arise. I call
this the paradox of hyperintensional contexts. Hyperintensional
contexts are simply contexts which do not respect logical
equivalence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starting with Cresswell himself, several ways of dealing with this
have been proposed. Generally these involve adding more layers to
familiar possible world approaches so that some way of distinguishing
between logically equivalent sentences is available. Cresswell
suggested that the syntactic form of sentences be taken into
account. Justification Logic, in effect, takes sentence form into
account through its mechanism for handling justifications for
sentences. Thus Justification Logic addresses some of the central
issues of hyperintensionality and, as a bonus, we automatically have
an appropriate proof theory, model theory, complexity estimates and a
broad variety of applications.</p>

<p>A good example of a hyperintensional context is the informal
language used by mathematicians conversing with each other. Typically
when a mathematician says he or she knows something, the understanding
is that a proof is at hand. But as the following illustrates, this
kind of knowledge is essentially hyperintensional.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fermat&rsquo;s Last Theorem, FLT, is logically equivalent to
\(0=0\) since both are provable, and hence denote the same
proposition. However, the context of proofs distinguishes them
immediately: a proof \(t\) of \(0=0\) is not necessarily a proof of
FLT, and vice versa.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To formalize mathematical speech the justification logic
\({\textsf{LP}}\) is a natural choice since \(t{:}X\) was designed to
have characteristics of &ldquo;\(t\) <em>is a proof of</em>
\(X\).&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fact that propositions \(X\) and \(Y\) are equivalent in
\({\textsf{LP}}\), \(X\leftrightarrow Y\), does not warrant the
equivalence of the corresponding justification assertions and
typically \(t{:}X\) and \(t{:}Y\) are not equivalent,
\(t{:}X\not\leftrightarrow t{:}Y\).</p>

<p>Going further \({\textsf{LP}}\), and Justification Logic in
general, is not only sufficiently refined to distinguish justification
assertions for logically equivalent sentences, it provides a flexible
machinery to connect justifications of equivalent sentences and hence
to maintain constructive closure properties necessary for a quality
logic system. For example, let \(X\) and \(Y\) be provably equivalent,
i.e., there is a proof \(u\) of \(X\leftrightarrow Y\), and so
\(u{:}(X\leftrightarrow Y)\) is provable in \({\textsf{LP}}\). Suppose
also that \(v\) is a proof of \(X\), and so \(v{:}X\). It has already
been mentioned that this does not mean \(v\) is a proof of
\(Y\)&mdash;this is a hyperintensional context. However within the
framework of Justification Logic, building on the proofs of \(X\) and
of \(X\leftrightarrow Y\), we can <em>construct</em> a proof term
\(f(u,v)\) which represents the proof of \(Y\) and so \(f(u,v){:}Y\)
is provable. In this respect, Justification Logic goes beyond
Cresswell&rsquo;s expectations: logically equivalent sentences display
different but constructively controlled epistemic behavior.</p>

<h2><a id="BasComJusLog">2. The Basic Components of Justification Logic</a></h2>

<p>

In this section the syntax and axiomatics of the most common systems 
of justification logic are presented.</p>

<h3><a id="LanJusLog">2.1 The Language of Justification Logic</a></h3>

<p>

In order to build a formal account of justification logics one must 
make a basic structural assumption: <em>justifications are abstract 
objects which have structure and operations on them</em>. A good 
example of justifications is provided by formal proofs, which have 
long been objects of study in mathematical logic and computer science
(cf. Section 1.2).</p>

<p>

Justification Logic is a formal logical framework which incorporates 
epistemic assertions \(t : F\), standing for 
&lsquo;\(t\) is a justification for \(F\)&rsquo;. 
Justification Logic does not directly analyze what it means for 
\(t\) to justify \(F\) beyond the format 
\(t : F\), but rather attempts to characterize this 
relation axiomatically. This is similar to the way Boolean logic 
treats its connectives, say, disjunction: it does not analyze the 
formula \(p \vee q\) but rather assumes certain logical
axioms and truth tables about this formula.</p>

<p>

There are several design decisions made. Justification Logic starts 
with the simplest base: <em>classical Boolean logic</em>, and for good
reasons. Justifications provide a sufficiently serious challenge on 
even the simplest level. The paradigmatic examples by Russell, 
Goldman-Kripke, Gettier and others, can be handled with Boolean 
Justification Logic. The core of Epistemic Logic consists of modal 
systems with a classical Boolean base
 (<span class="sanserif">K, T, K4, S4, K45, KD45, S5</span>,
 etc.), and each of 
them has been provided with a corresponding Justification Logic 
companion based on Boolean logic. Finally, factivity of 
justifications is not always assumed. This makes it possible to 
capture the essence of discussions in epistemology involving matters 
of belief and not knowledge.</p>

<p>

The basic operation on justifications
is <em>application</em>. The <em>application</em> operation takes
justifications \(s\) and \(t\) and produces a justification \(s\cdot
t\) such that if \(s :( F \rightarrow G)\) and \(t : F\), then
[\(s\cdot t ]: G\). Symbolically,</p>

\[
s :( F \rightarrow G ) \rightarrow ( t : F \rightarrow [ s\cdot t ]: G)
\]

<p>

This is a basic property of justifications assumed in combinatory 
logic and <em>\(\lambda\) </em> -calculi (Troelstra and Schwichtenberg 
1996), Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov semantics (Troelstra and van Dalen 
1988), Kleene realizability (Kleene 1945), the Logic of Proofs
 \(\mathsf{LP}\),
 etc.</p>

<p>

Another common operation on justifications is sum: it has been introduced to
make explicit the modal logic reasoning (Artemov 1995).  However, some meaningful
justification logics like \({\mathsf{J}}^{-}\) (Artemov and Fitting 2019)
do not use the operation sum.  With sum, any two justifications can safely be combined
into something with broader scope.  If \(s : F\), 
then whatever evidence \(t\) may be, the combined evidence 
\(s\) + \(t\) remains a justification for \(F\). More 
properly, the operation &lsquo;+&rsquo; takes justifications 
\(s\) and \(t\) and produces \(s\) + \(t\), which
is a justification for everything justified by \(s\) or by 
\(t\).</p>

\[
s : F \rightarrow [ s + t ]: F
\text{ and }
t : F \rightarrow [ s + t ]: F
\]

<p>

As motivation, one might think of \(s\) and \(t\) as two 
volumes of an encyclopedia, and \(s\) + \(t\) as the set of
those two volumes. Imagine that one of the volumes, say \(s\), 
contains a sufficient justification for a proposition \(F\), 
i.e., \(s : F\) is the case. Then the larger set 
\(s\) + \(t\) also contains a sufficient justification for 
\(F\), [\(s\) + \(t ]: F\). In the Logic of 
Proofs \(\mathsf{LP}\), Section 
1.2, &lsquo;\(s\) + \(t\)&rsquo; can be interpreted as a 
concatenation of proofs \(s\) and \(t\).</p>

<h3><a id="BasJusLogMat">2.2 Basic Justification Logic \(\mathsf{J}_{0}\)</a></h3>

<p>

Justification terms are built from justification variables 
\(x , y , z\), &hellip; and justification 
constants \(a , b , c\), &hellip; (with indices 
\(i\) = 1, 2, 3, &hellip; which are omitted whenever it is safe)
by means of the operations &lsquo;\(\cdot\) &rsquo; and &lsquo;+&rsquo;. 
More elaborate logics considered below also allow additional 
operations on justifications. Constants denote atomic justifications 
which the system does not analyze; variables denote unspecified 
justifications. The Basic Logic of Justifications,
 \(\mathsf{J}_{0}\) is axiomatized by the 
following.</p>

  <dl class="indent">
    <dt>Classical Logic</dt>
    <dd><em>Classical propositional axioms and the rule Modus Ponens</em></dd>
    <dt>Application Axiom</dt>
    <dd>\(s :( F \rightarrow G ) \rightarrow ( t : F \rightarrow [ s\cdot t ]: G)\),</dd>
    <dt>Sum Axioms</dt>
    <dd>\(s : F \rightarrow [ s\)
    + \(t ]: F , s : F \rightarrow [ t\)
    + \(s ]: F\).</dd>
  </dl>

<p>

\(\mathsf{J}_{0}\) is the
logic of general (not necessarily factive) justifications for an 
absolutely skeptical agent for whom no formula is provably justified,
i.e., \(\mathsf{J}_{0}\) 
does not derive \(t : F\) for any \(t\) and 
\(F\). Such an agent is, however, capable of drawing 
<em>relative justification conclusions</em> of the form</p>

\[
\text{If } x : A , y : B, \ldots, z : C
 \text{ hold, then  } t : F.
\]

<p>

With this capacity
 \(\mathsf{J}_{0}\)
 is able to adequately emulate many other 
Justification Logic systems in its language.</p>

<h3><a id="LogAwaConSpe">2.3 Logical Awareness and Constant Specifications</a></h3>

<p>

The <em>Logical Awareness principle</em> states that logical axioms 
are justified <em>ex officio</em>: an agent accepts logical axioms as
justified (including the ones concerning justifications). As just 
stated, Logical Awareness may be too strong in some epistemic 
situations. However Justification Logic offers the flexible mechanism
of Constant Specifications to represent varying shades of Logical 
Awareness.</p>

<p>

Of course one distinguishes between an assumption and a justified 
assumption. In Justification Logic constants are used to represent 
justifications of assumptions in situations where they are not 
analyzed any further. Suppose it is desired to postulate that an 
axiom \(A\) is justified for the knower. One simply postulates 
\(e_{1} : A\) for some evidence constant 
\(e_{1}\) (with index 1). If, furthermore, it is desired
to postulate that this new principle 
\(e_{1} : A\) is also justified, one can 
postulate \(e_{2} :( e_{1} : A)\) 
for a constant \(e_{2}\) (with index 2). And so on. 
Keeping track of indices is not necessary, but it is easy and helps 
in decision procedures (Kuznets 2008). The set of all assumptions of 
this kind for a given logic is called a <em>Constant 
Specification</em>. Here is the formal definition:</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>

A <strong>Constant Specification</strong> \(CS\) for a given 
justification logic \(\mathcal{L}\) is a set of 
formulas of the form</p>

\[
e_{n} : e_{n- 1}: \ldots : e_{1} : A ( n \ge  1),
\]

<p>

where \(A\) is an axiom of \(\mathcal{L}\), and 
\(e_{1} , e_{2}, \ldots, e_{n}\) are similar constants with indices 1,
2, &hellip;, \(n\). It is assumed that \(CS\) contains all 
intermediate specifications, i.e., whenever 
\(e_{n} : e_{n- 1}:\ldots:e_{1} : A\)
is in \(CS\), then 
\(e_{n- 1}:\ldots:e_{1} : A\)
is in \(CS\) too.</p>

</div>

<p>

There are a number of special conditions that have been placed on 
constant specifications in the literature. The following are the most
common.</p>

<dl class="indent">
  <dt>Empty</dt>
  <dd>\(CS = \varnothing\) . This corresponds to an absolutely
  skeptical agent. It amounts to working with the
  logic \(\mathsf{J}_{0}\).</dd>
  <dt>Finite</dt>
  <dd>\(CS\) is a finite set of formulas. This is a fully
  representative case, since any specific derivation in Justification
  Logic will involve only a finite set of constants.</dd>
  <dt>Axiomatically Appropriate</dt>
  <dd>Each axiom, including those newly acquired through the constant
  specification itself, have justifications. In the formal setting,
  for each axiom \(A\) there is a constant \(e_{1}\) such that \(e_{1}
  : A\) is in \(CS\), and if \(e_{n} : e_{n- 1} : \ldots : e_{1} : A
  \in CS\), then \(e_{n+1} : e_{n} : e_{n- 1} : \ldots : e_{1} : A
  \in CS\), for each \(n \ge 1\). Axiomatically appropriate constant
  specifications are necessary for ensuring the Internalization
  property, discussed at the end of this section.</dd>
  <dt>Total</dt>
  <dd>For each axiom \(A\) and any constants 
\(e_{1} , e_{2}, \ldots, e_{n}\),

\[e_{n} : e_{n- 1} : \ldots : e_1 : A \in CS.
\]

The name <em>TCS</em> is reserved for the total constant 
specification (for a given logic). Naturally, the total constant 
specification is axiomatically appropriate.</dd>
</dl>

<p>We may now specify:</p>

<div class="indent">
  <b>Logic of Justifications with given Constant Specification</b>:<br />
   Let \(CS\) be a constant specification.
 \(\mathsf{J}_{CS}\) is the
logic
 \(\mathsf{J}_{0}\)
+ \(CS\) ; the axioms are those of
 \(\mathsf{J}_{0}\)
 together with the members
of \(CS\), and the only rule of inference is <em>Modus
Ponens</em>. Note that
 \(\mathsf{J}_{0}\) is
 \(\mathsf{J}_{\varnothing}\).
  
  <p>
  <b>Logic of Justifications</b>:<br />
  \(\mathsf{J}\)
 is the logic
 \(\mathsf{J}_{0}\) + 
<strong>Axiom Internalization Rule</strong>. The new rule states:</p>

    <p class="indent">
      For each axiom \(A\) and any
      constants \(e_{1} , e_{2}, \ldots, e_{n}\)
      infer \(e_{n} : e_{n- 1} : \ldots : e_{1} : A\).
    </p>

</div>

<p>The latter embodies the idea of unrestricted Logical Awareness for
\(\mathsf{J}\). A similar rule appeared in the Logic of Proofs
\(\mathsf{LP}\), and has also been anticipated in Goldman&rsquo;s
(Goldman 1967). Logical Awareness, as expressed by axiomatically
appropriate Constant Specifications, is an explicit incarnation of the
Necessitation Rule in Modal Logic: \(\vdash F \Rightarrow\, \vdash \Box
F\), but restricted to axioms. Note that \(\mathsf{J}\) coincides with
\(\mathsf{J}_{TCS}\).</p>

<p>

The key feature of Justification Logic systems is their ability to 
internalize their own derivations as provable justification 
assertions within their languages. This property was anticipated in 
(G&ouml;del 1938).</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>

<strong>Theorem 1</strong>: For each axiomatically appropriate 
constant specification \(CS\), J\(_{CS}\) enjoys 
Internalization:</p>

  <p class="indent">
If \(\vdash F\), then \(\vdash p : F\) for some justification term \(p\).
  </p>

<p>

<strong>Proof.</strong> Induction on derivation length. Suppose
\(\vdash\) &thinsp;\(F\). If \(F\) is a member of \(\mathsf{J}_{0}\),
or a member of \(CS\), there is a constant \(e_{n}\) (where \(n\)
might be 1) such that \(e_{n} : F\) is in \(CS\), since \(CS\) is
axiomatically appropriate. Then \(e_{n} : F\) is derivable. If \(F\)
is obtained by <em>Modus Ponens</em> from \(X \rightarrow F\) and
\(X\), then, by the Induction Hypothesis, \(\vdash s :( X \rightarrow
F)\) and \(\vdash t : X\) for some \(s , t\). Using the Application
Axiom, \(\vdash [ s\cdot t ]: F\).</p>
</div>

<p>

 for examples of concrete syntactic derivations in
 justification logic.</p>

<h3><a id="ExtBasJusLog">2.4 Extending Basic Justification Logic</a></h3>

<p>The basic justification logic \({\textsf{J}}_0\), and its extension
with a constant specification \({\textsf{J}}_{CS}\), is an explicit
counterpart of the smallest normal modal logic \({\textsf{K}}\). A
proper definition of counterpart will be given in Section&nbsp;4
because the notion of <em>realization</em> is central, but some hints
are already apparent at this stage of our presentation. For instance,
it was noted in Section&nbsp;1.1 that (1), \(s{:}(A\rightarrow
B)\rightarrow(t{:}A\rightarrow [s\cdot t]{:}B)\), is an explicit
version of the familiar modal principle (2), \({\square}(A\rightarrow
B) \rightarrow ({\square}A\rightarrow {\square}B)\). In a similar way
the first justification logic \(\textsf{LP}\) is an explicit
counterpart of modal \({\textsf{S4}}\). It turns out that many modal
logics have justification logic counterparts&mdash;indeed, generally
more than one. In what follows we begin by discussing some very
familiar logics, leading up to \({\textsf{S4}}\) and
\(\textsf{LP}\). Up to this point much of our original motivation
applies&mdash;we have justification logics that are interpretable in
arithmetic. Then we move on to a broader family of modal logics, and
the arithmetic motivation is no longer applicable. The phenomenon of
having a modal logic with a justification logic counterpart has turned
out to be unexpectedly broad.</p>

<p>In almost all cases, one must add operations to the \(+\) and
\(\cdot\) of \({\textsf{J}}_0\), along with axioms capturing their
intended behavior. The exception is factivity, discussed next, for
which no additional operations are required, though additional axioms
are. It is always understood that constant specifications cover axioms
from the enlarged set. We continue using the terminology of Section
2.3; for instance a constant specification is axiomatically
appropriate if it meets the condition as stated there, <em>for all
axioms including any that have been added to the original set.</em>
Theorem 1 from Section 2.3 continues to apply to our new justification
logics, and with the same proof: if we have a justification logic
\(\textsf{JL}_{CS}\) with an axiomatically appropriate constant
specification, Internalization holds.</p>

<h3><a id="Fac">2.5 Factivity</a></h3>

<p>

Factivity states that justifications are sufficient for an agent to 
conclude truth. This is embodied in the following.</p>

<p class="indent">
  <strong>Factivity Axiom</strong> \(t : F \rightarrow F\).
</p>

<p>

The Factivity Axiom has a similar motivation to the Truth Axiom of 
Epistemic Logic, \(\Box F \rightarrow F\), which is widely
accepted as a basic property of knowledge.</p>

<p>

Factivity of justifications is not required in basic Justification Logic 
systems, which makes them capable of representing both partial and
factive justifications.
The Factivity Axiom appeared in the Logic of Proofs 
\(\mathsf{LP}\), Section 1.2, as 
a principal feature of mathematical proofs. Indeed, in this setting 
Factivity is clearly valid: if there is a mathematical proof 
\(t\) of \(F\), then \(F\) must be true.</p>

<p>

The Factivity Axiom is adopted for justifications that lead to 
knowledge. However, factivity alone does not warrant knowledge, as 
has been demonstrated by the Gettier examples (Gettier 1963).</p>

<div class="indent">
  <p>

<strong>Logic of Factive Justifications</strong>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>\(\mathsf{JT}_{0} = \mathsf{J}_{0}\) + Factivity;</li>
    <li>\(\mathsf{JT} = \mathsf{J}\) + Factivity.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>

Systems \(\mathsf{JT}_{CS}\) corresponding to Constant
Specifications \(CS\) are defined as in Section 2.3.</p>

<h3><a id="PosInt">2.6 Positive Introspection</a></h3>

<p>

One of the common principles of knowledge is identifying 
<em>knowing</em> and <em>knowing that one knows</em>. In a modal
setting, this corresponds to \(\Box F \rightarrow \Box \Box F\). This
principle has an adequate explicit counterpart: the fact that an agent
accepts \(t\) as sufficient evidence for \(F\) serves as sufficient
evidence for \(t : F\). Often such &lsquo;meta-evidence&rsquo; has a
physical form: a referee report certifying that a proof in a paper is
correct; a computer verification output given a formal proof \(t\) of
\(F\) as an input; a formal proof that \(t\) is a proof of \(F\),
etc. A <em>Positive Introspection</em> operation &lsquo;!&rsquo; may
be added to the language for this purpose; one then assumes that given
\(t\), the agent produces a justification !\(t\) of \(t : F\) such
that \(t : F \rightarrow ! t :( t : F)\).  Positive Introspection in
this operational form first appeared in the Logic of Proofs
\(\mathsf{LP}\).</p>

<p class="indent">
  <strong>Positive Introspection Axiom</strong>: \(t : F \rightarrow ! t :( t : F)\).
</p>

<p>

We then define:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(\mathsf{J4} := \mathsf{J}\) + Positive Introspection;</li>
  <li>\(\mathsf{LP} := \mathsf{JT}\) + Positive
 Introspection.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>

Logics \(\mathsf{J4}_{0} , \mathsf{J4}_{CS} , \mathsf{LP}_{0}\), and
 \(\mathsf{LP}_{CS}\) are defined in
the natural way (cf. Section 2.3).</p>

<p>

In the presence of the Positive Introspection Axiom, one can limit 
the scope of the Axiom Internalization Rule to internalizing axioms 
which are not of the form \(e : A\). This is how it was 
done in \(\mathsf{LP}\): Axiom 
Internalization can then be emulated by using 
!!\(e :(! e :( e : A))\) instead of 
\(e_{3} :( e_{2} :( e_{1} : A))\), etc.
The notion of Constant Specification can also be simplified 
accordingly. Such modifications are minor and they do not affect the 
main theorems and applications of Justification Logic.</p>

<h3><a id="NegInt">2.7 Negative Introspection</a></h3>

<p>

(Pacuit 2006, Rubtsova 2006) considered the <em>Negative
Introspection</em> operation &lsquo;?&rsquo; which verifies that a
given justification assertion is false. A possible motivation for
considering such an operation is that the positive introspection
operation &lsquo;!&rsquo; may well be regarded as capable of
providing <em>conclusive</em> verification judgments about the
validity of justification assertions \(t : F\), so when \(t\) is not a
justification for \(F\), such a &lsquo;!&rsquo; should conclude that
\(\neg t : F\). This is normally the case for computer proof
verifiers, proof checkers in formal theories, etc. This motivation is,
however, nuanced: the examples of proof verifiers and proof checkers
work with both \(t\) and \(F\) as inputs, whereas the Pacuit-Rubtsova
format ?\(t\) suggests that the only input for &lsquo;?&rsquo; is a
justification \(t\), and the result ?\(t\) is supposed to justify
propositions \(\neg t : F\) uniformly for all \(F\)s for which \(t :
F\) does not hold. Such an operation &lsquo;?&rsquo; does not exist
for formal mathematical proofs since ?\(t\) should then be a single
proof of infinitely many propositions \(\neg t : F\), which is
impossible.  The operation &lsquo;?&rsquo; was, historically, the
first example that did not fit into the original framework in which
justifications were abstract versions of formal proofs.
</p>

<p class="indent">
  <strong>Negative Introspection Axiom</strong>
  \(\neg t : F \rightarrow ? t :( \neg t : F)\)
</p>

<p>

We define the systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(\mathsf{J45} = \mathsf{J4}\) + Negative Introspection;</li>
  <li>\(\mathsf{JD45} = \mathsf{J45}\) + \(\neg t : \bot\) ;</li>
  <li>\(\mathsf{JT45} = \mathsf{J45}\) + Factivity</li>

and naturally extend these definitions to

<h3><a id="GeaLog">2.8 Geach Logics and More</a></h3>

<p>Justification logics involving \(?\) were the first examples that
went beyond sublogics of \({\textsf{LP}}\). More recently it has been
discovered that there is an <em>infinite</em> family of modal logics
that have justification counterparts, but for which the connection
with arithmetic proofs is weak or missing. We discuss a single case in
some detail, and sketch others.</p>

<p>Peter Geach proposed the axiom scheme
\({\lozenge}{\square}X{\rightarrow}{\square}{\lozenge}X\). When added
to axiomatic \({\textsf{S4}}\) it yields an interesting logic known as
\(\textsf{S4.2}\). Semantically, Geach&rsquo;s scheme
imposes <em>confluence</em> on frames. That is, if two possible
worlds, \(w_1\) and \(w_2\) are accessible from the same world
\(w_0\), there is a common world \(w_4\) accessible from both \(w_1\)
and \(w_2\). Geach&rsquo;s scheme was generalized
in <span class="citation">Lemmon and Scott (1977)</span> and a
corresponding notation was introduced: \({\textsf{G}}^{k,l,m,n}\) is
the scheme \({\lozenge}^k{\square}^l X
{\rightarrow}{\square}^m{\lozenge}^n X\), where \(k, l, m, n\geq
0\). Semantically these schemes correspond to generalized versions of
confluence. Some people have begun referring to the schemes
as <em>Geach schemes</em>, and we will follow this practice. More
generally, we will call a modal logic a <em>Geach</em> logic if it can
be axiomatized by adding a finite set of Geach schemes to
\({\textsf{K}}\). The original Geach scheme is
\({\textsf{G}}^{1,1,1,1}\), but also note that
\({\square}X{\rightarrow}X\) is \({\textsf{G}}^{0,1,0,0}\),
\({\square}X{\rightarrow}{\square}{\square}X\) is
\({\textsf{G}}^{0,1,2,0}\),
\({\lozenge}X{\rightarrow}{\square}{\lozenge}X\) is
\({\textsf{G}}^{1,0,1,1}\), and \(X{\rightarrow}{\square}{\lozenge}X\)
is \({\textsf{G}}^{0,0,1,1}\), so Geach logics include the most common
of the modal logics. Geach logics constitute an infinite family.</p>

<p>Every Geach logic has a justification counterpart. Consider the
original Geach logic, with axiom scheme \(\textsf{G}^{1,1,1,1}\),
\({\lozenge}{\square}X{\rightarrow}{\square}{\lozenge}X\) added to a
system for \(\textsf{S4}\)&mdash;the system \(\textsf{S4.2}\)
mentioned above. We build a justification counterpart for
\(\textsf{S4.2}\) axiomatically by starting with
\({\textsf{LP}}\). Then we add two function symbols, \(f\) and \(g\),
each two-place, and adopt the following axiom scheme, calling the
resulting justification logic \(\textsf{J4.2}\). </p>

\[\lnot
f(t,u){:}\lnot t{:}X {\rightarrow}g(t,u){:}\lnot u{:}\lnot X\] 

<p>
There
is some informal motivation for this scheme. In \({\textsf{LP}}\),
because of the axiom scheme \(t{:}X{\rightarrow}X\), we have
provability of \((t{:}X\land u{:}\lnot X){\rightarrow}\bot\) for any
\(t\) and \(u\), and thus provability of \(\lnot t{:}X \lor\lnot
u{:}\lnot X\). In any context one of the disjuncts must hold. The
scheme above is equivalent to \(f(t,u){:}\lnot t{:}X \lor
g(t,u){:}\lnot u{:}\lnot X\), which informally says that in any
context we have means for computing a justification for the disjunct
that holds. It is a strong assumption, but not implausible at least in
some circumstances.</p>

<p>A realization theorem connects \(\textsf{S4.2}\) and
\(\textsf{J4.2}\), though it is not known if this has a constructive
proof.</p>

<p>As another example, consider \({\textsf{G}}^{1,2,2,1}\),
\({\lozenge}{\square}{\square}X{\rightarrow}{\square}{\square}{\lozenge}X\),
or equivalently \({\square}\lnot{\square}{\square}X \lor
{\square}{\square}\lnot{\square}X\). It has as a corresponding
justification axiom scheme the following, where \(f\), \(g\), and
\(h\) are three-place function symbols.</p>

\[f(t,u,v){:}\lnot
t{:}u{:}X\lor g(t,u,v){:}h(t,u,v){:}\lnot v{:}\lnot X\] 

<p>
An intuitive
interpretation for \(f\), \(g\), and \(h\) is not as clear as it is
for \(\textsf{G}^{1,1,1,1}\), but formally things behave quite
well.</p>

<p>Even though the Geach family is infinite, these logics do not cover
the full range of logics with justification counterparts. For
instance, the normal modal logic using the axiom scheme
\({\square}({\square}X{\rightarrow}X)\), sometimes called <em>shift
reflexivity</em>, is not a Geach logic, but it does have a
justification counterpart. Add a one-place function symbol \(k\) to
the machinery building up justification terms, and adopt the
justification axiom scheme \(k(t){:}(t{:}X{\rightarrow}X)\). A
Realization Theorem holds; this is shown
in <span class="citation">Fitting (2014b)</span>. We speculate that
all logics axiomatized with Sahlquist formulas will have justification
counterparts, but this remains a conjecture at this point.</p>


<h2><a id="Sem">3. Semantics</a></h2>

<p>

The now-standard semantics for justification logic originates in
(Fitting 2005)&mdash;the models used are generally called <em>Fitting
models</em> in the literature, but will be called <em>possible world
justification models</em> here. Possible world justification models
are an amalgam of the familiar possible world semantics for logics of
knowledge and belief, due to Hintikka and Kripke, with machinery
specific to justification terms, introduced by Mkrtychev in (Mkrtychev
1997), (cf. Section 3.4).</p>

<h3><a id="SinAgePosWorJusModForMat">3.1 Single-Agent Possible World Justification Models for \(\mathsf{J}\)</a></h3>

<p>

To be precise, a semantics for \(\mathsf{J}_{CS}\), where \(CS\) is
any constant specification, is to be defined. Formally, a <em>possible
world justification logic model</em> for \(\mathsf{J}_{CS}\) is a
structure \(\mathcal{M} = \langle \mathcal{G} , \mathcal{R} ,
\mathcal{E} , \mathcal{V}\rangle\) . Of this, \(\langle \mathcal{G} ,
\mathcal{R}\rangle\) is a standard \(\mathsf{K}\) frame, where
\(\mathcal{G}\) is a set of possible worlds and \(\mathcal{R}\) is a
binary relation on it.  \(\mathcal{V}\) is a mapping from
propositional variables to subsets of \(\mathcal{G}\), specifying
atomic truth at possible worlds.</p>

<p>

The new item is \(\mathcal{E}\), an <em>evidence 
function</em>, which originated in (Mkrtychev 1997). This maps 
justification terms and formulas to sets of worlds. The intuitive 
idea is, if the possible world \(\Gamma\)  is in
 \(\mathcal{E} ( t , X)\), then \(t\) is 
<em>relevant</em> or <em>admissible</em> evidence for \(X\) at 
world \(\Gamma\) . One should not think of relevant evidence as 
conclusive. Rather, think of it as more like evidence that can be 
admitted in a court of law: this testimony, this document is 
something a jury should examine, something that is pertinent, but 
something whose truth-determining status is yet to be considered. 
Evidence functions must meet certain conditions, but these are 
discussed a bit later.</p>

<p>

Given a \(\mathsf{J}_{CS}\) possible world justification model
\(\mathcal{M} = \langle \mathcal{G} , \mathcal{R} , \mathcal{E} ,
\mathcal{V}\rangle\) , truth of formula \(X\) at possible world
\(\Gamma\) is denoted by \(\mathcal{M} , \Gamma \Vdash X\), and is
required to meet the following standard conditions:</p>

<div class="indent">
<p>

For each \(\Gamma \in \mathcal{G}\):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    \(\mathcal{M} , \Gamma \Vdash P\)
    iff \(\Gamma \in \mathcal{V} ( P)\) for \(P\) a propositional letter;
  </li>
  <li>it is not the case that
 \(\mathcal{M} , \Gamma \Vdash \bot\) ;</li>
  <li>
    \(\mathcal{M} , \Gamma \Vdash X \rightarrow Y\) iff it is not the
    case that \(\mathcal{M} , \Gamma \Vdash X\) or \(\mathcal{M} ,
    \Gamma \Vdash Y\).
  </li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>

These just say that atomic truth is specified arbitrarily, and 
propositional connectives behave truth-functionally at each world. 
The key item is the next one.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    \(\mathcal{M} , \Gamma \Vdash ( t : X)\) if and only if \(\Gamma
    \in \mathcal{E} ( t , X)\) and, for every \(\Delta \in
    \mathcal{G}\) with \(\Gamma \mathcal{R} \Delta\) , we have that
    \(\mathcal{M} , \Delta \Vdash X\).
  </li>
</ol>

<p>

This condition breaks into two parts. The clause requiring that
 \(\mathcal{M} , \Delta \Vdash X\) for every \(\Delta \in
 \mathcal{G}\) such that \(\Gamma \mathcal{R} \Delta\) is the familiar
 Hintikka/Kripke condition for \(X\) to be believed, or be believable,
 at \(\Gamma\) . The clause requiring that \(\Gamma \in \mathcal{E} (
 t , X)\) adds that \(t\) should be relevant evidence for \(X\) at
 \(\Gamma\) . Then, informally, \(t : X\) is true at a possible world
 if \(X\) is believable at that world in the usual sense of epistemic
 logic, and \(t\) is relevant evidence for \(X\) at that world.</p>

<p>

It is important to realize that, in this semantics, one might not 
believe something for a particular reason at a world either because 
it is simply not believable, or because it is but the reason is not 
appropriate.</p>

<p>

Some conditions must still be placed on evidence functions, and the 
constant specification must also be brought into the picture. Suppose
one is given \(s\) and \(t\) as justifications. One can 
combine these in two different ways: simultaneously use the 
information from both; or use the information from just one of them, 
but first choose which one. Each gives rise to a basic operation on 
justification terms, \(\cdot\)  and +, introduced axiomatically in 
Section 2.2.</p>

<p>

Suppose \(s\) is relevant evidence for an implication and 
\(t\) is relevant evidence for the antecedent. Then \(s\) 
and \(t\) together provides relevant evidence for the 
consequent. The following condition on evidence functions is assumed:</p>

\[\mathcal{E}(s,X \rightarrow Y ) \cap \mathcal{E} 
( t , X ) \subseteq \mathcal{E} ( s\cdot t,Y)
\]

<p>

With this condition added, the validity of</p>

\[
s :( X \rightarrow Y ) \rightarrow ( t : X \rightarrow [ s\cdot t ]: Y)
\]

<p>

is secured.</p>

<p>

If \(s\) and \(t\) are items of evidence, one might say 
that something is justified by one of \(s\) or \(t\), 
without bothering to specify which, and this will still be evidence. 
The following requirement is imposed on evidence functions.</p>

\[
\mathcal{E}(s,X) \cup \mathcal{E} ( t , X ) \subseteq \mathcal{E} ( s + t , X)
\]

<p>

Not surprisingly, both</p>

\[
s : X \rightarrow [ s + t ]: X
\]

<p>

and</p>

\[
t : X \rightarrow [ s + t ]: X
\]

<p>

now hold.</p>

<p>

Finally, the Constant Specification \(CS\) should be taken into 
account. Recall that constants are intended to represent reasons for 
basic assumptions that are accepted outright. A model
 \(\mathcal{M} = \langle \mathcal{G} , \mathcal{R} , \mathcal{E} , \mathcal{V}\rangle\)  
<em>meets</em> Constant Specification \(CS\) provided: if 
\(c : X \in CS\) then
 \(\mathcal{E}\)(<em>c,X</em>) = \(\mathcal{G}\).</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Possible World Justification Model</strong> A possible world
 justification model for \(\mathsf{J}_{CS}\) is a structure
 \(\mathcal{M} = \langle \mathcal{G} , \mathcal{R} , \mathcal{E} ,
 \mathcal{V}\rangle\) satisfying all the conditions listed above, and
 meeting Constant Specification \(CS\).
</p>

<p>

Despite their similarities, possible world justification models allow
a fine-grained analysis that is not possible with Kripke models. See
Section 3 of the supplementary document
 <a href="supplement.html">Some More Technical Matters</a>
for more details.</p>

<h3><a id="WeaStrCom">3.2 Weak and Strong Completeness</a></h3>

<p>

A formula \(X\) is <em>valid</em> in a particular model for 
\(\mathsf{J}_{CS}\) if it is true at all 
possible worlds of the model. Axiomatics for
 \(\mathsf{J}_{CS}\) was given in 
Sections 2.2 and 2.3. A completeness theorem now takes the expected 
form.</p>

<p class="indent">
 <strong>Theorem 2</strong>: A formula \(X\) is provable
 in \(\mathsf{J}_{CS}\)
 if and only if \(X\) is valid
 in all \(\mathsf{J}_{CS}\) models.
</p>

<p>

The completeness theorem as just stated is sometimes referred to as 
<em>weak</em> completeness. It maybe a bit surprising that it is 
significantly easier to prove than completeness for the modal logic 
\(\mathsf{K}\). Comments on this 
point follow. On the other hand it is very general, working for all 
Constant Specifications.</p>

<p>

In (Fitting 2005) a stronger version of the semantics was also
introduced. A model \(\mathcal{M} = \langle \mathcal{G} , \mathcal{R}
, \mathcal{E} , \mathcal{V}\rangle\) is called <em>fully
explanatory</em> if it meets the following condition. For each
\(\Gamma \in \mathcal{G}\), if \(\mathcal{M} , \Delta \Vdash X\) for
all \(\Delta \in \mathcal{G}\) such that \(\Gamma \mathcal{R} \Delta\)
, then \(\mathcal{M} , \Gamma \Vdash t : X\) for some justification
term \(t\). Note that the condition, \(\mathcal{M} , \Delta \Vdash X\)
for all \(\Delta \in \mathcal{G}\) such that \(\Gamma \mathcal{R}
\Delta\) , is the usual condition for \(X\) being believable at
\(\Gamma\) in the Hintikka/Kripke sense.  So, fully explanatory really
says that if a formula is believable at a possible world, there is a
justification for it.</p>

<p>

Not all weak models meet the fully explanatory condition. Models that
do are called <em>strong</em> models. If constant specification 
\(CS\) is rich enough so that an Internalization theorem holds, 
then one has completeness with respect to strong models meeting 
\(CS\). Indeed, in an appropriate sense completeness with 
respect to strong models is equivalent to being able to prove 
Internalization.</p>

<p>

The proof of completeness with respect to strong models bears a close
similarity to the proof of completeness using canonical models for 
the modal logic \(\mathsf{K}\). 
In turn, strong models can be used to give a semantic proof of the 
Realization Theorem (cf. Section 4).</p>

<h3><a id="SinAgeFam">3.3 The Single-Agent Family</a></h3>

<p>

So far a possible world semantics for one justification logic has been 
discussed, for \(\mathsf{J}\), 
the counterpart of
 \(\mathsf{K}\). Now things are broadened to encompass 
justification analogs of other familiar modal logics.</p>

<p>Simply by adding reflexivity of the accessibility relation
\(\mathcal{R}\) to the conditions for a model in Section 3.1, one
gains the validity of \(t{:}X \rightarrow X\) for every \(t\) and
\(X\), and obtains a semantics for \(\mathsf{JT}\), the justification logic analog of
the modal logic \({\textsf{T}}\), the weakest logic of
knowledge. Indeed, if \({\mathcal{M},\Gamma{\Vdash}t{:}X}\) then, in particular,
\(X\) is true at every state accessible from \(\Gamma\). Since the
accessibility relation is required to be reflexive,
\({\mathcal{M},\Gamma{\Vdash}X}\). Weak and strong completeness theorems are
provable using the same machinery that applied in the case of \(\textsf{J}\), and a
semantic proof of a Realization Theorem connecting  \(\mathsf{JT}\) and
\({\textsf{T}}\) is also available. The same applies to the logics
discussed below.</p>

<p>For a justification analog of \({\textsf{K4}}\) an additional unary
operator &lsquo;!&rsquo; is added to the term language, see Section
2.5. Recall this operator maps justifications to justifications, where
the idea is that if \(t\) is a justification for \(X\), then \(!t\)
should be a justification for \(t{:}X\). Semantically this adds
conditions to a model \(\mathcal{M} = \langle
\mathcal{G},\mathcal{R},\mathcal{E},\mathcal{V}\rangle\), as
follows.</p>

<p>First, of course, \(\mathcal{R}\) should be transitive, but not
necessarily reflexive. Second, a monotonicity condition on evidence
functions is required:</p>

<p>\[\mbox{If } \Gamma \mathcal{R} \Delta \mbox{ and } \Gamma\in
\mathcal{E}(t,X) \mbox{ then } \Delta \in \mathcal{E}(t,X)\] And
finally, one more evidence function condition is needed.</p>

<p>\[\mathcal{E}(t,X) \subseteq \mathcal{E}(!t,t{:}X)\] These
conditions together entail the validity of \(t{:}X \rightarrow
!t{:}t{:}X\) and produce a semantics for \(\mathsf{J4}\), a
justification analog of \(\mathsf{K4}\), with a Realization Theorem
connecting them. Adding reflexivity leads to a logic that is called
\({\textsf{LP}}\) for historical reasons.</p>

<p>We have discussed justification logics that are sublogics of
\({\textsf{LP}}\), corresponding to sublogics of the modal logic
\(\textsf{S4}\). The first examples that went beyond \({\textsf{LP}}\)
were those discussed in Section 2.7, involving a negative
introspection operator, &lsquo;?&rsquo;. Models for justification
logics that include this operator add three conditions. First R is
symmetric. Second, one adds a condition that has come to be known
as <em>strong evidence</em>: \({\mathcal{M},\Gamma{\Vdash}t{:}X}\) for
all \(\Gamma\in \mathcal{E}(t, X)\). Finally, there is a condition on
the evidence function:</p>

\[\overline{\mathcal{E}(t,X)} \subseteq \mathcal{E}(?t, \lnot t{:}X)\] 

<p>If this machinery is added to that for \(\mathsf{J4}\) we get the
logic \(\mathsf{J45}\), a justification counterpart of
\(\mathsf{K45}\). Axiomatic soundness and completeness can be
proved. In a similar way, related logics \(\mathsf{JD45}\) and
\(\mathsf{JT45}\) can be formulated semantically. A Realization
Theorem taking the operator \(?\) into account was shown in (Rubtsova
2006).</p>

<p>Moving to Geach logics as introduced in Section 2.8, a semantic
model for \(\textsf{J4.2}\) can also be specified. Suppose \(G =
\langle \mathcal{G}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{V}\rangle\) is
an \({\textsf{LP}}\) model. We add the following requirements. First,
the frame must be convergent, as with \(\textsf{S4.2}\). Second, as
with \(?\), \(\mathcal{E}\) must be a <em>strong</em> evidence
function. And third, \(\mathcal{E}(f(t,u), \lnot t{:}X)\cup
\mathcal{E}(g(t,u), \lnot u{:}\lnot X) = \mathcal{G}\). Completeness
and soundness results follow in the usual way.</p>

<p>In a similar way every modal logic axiomatized by Geach schemes in
this family has a justification counterpart, with a Fitting semantics
and a realization theorem connecting the justification counterpart
with the corresponding modal logic. In particular, this tells us that
the justification logic family is infinite, and certainly much broader
than it was originally thought to be. It is also the case that some
modal logics not previously considered, and not in this family, have
justification counterparts as well. Investigating the consequences of
all this is still work in progress.</p>

<h3><a id="SinWorJusMod">3.4 Single World Justification Models</a></h3>

<p>

Single world justification models were developed considerably before
the more general possible world justification models we have been
discussing, (Mkrtychev 1997). Today they can most simply be thought of
as possible world justification models that happen to have a single
world. The completeness proof for \(\mathsf{J}\) and the other
justification logics mentioned above can easily be modified to
establish completeness with respect to single world justification
models, though of course this was not the original argument. What
completeness with respect to single world justification models tells
us is that information about the possible world structure of
justification models can be completely encoded by the admissible
evidence function, at least for the logics discussed so far. Mkrtychev
used single world justification models to establish decidability of
\(\mathsf{LP}\), and others have made fundamental use of them in
setting complexity bounds for justification logics, as well as for
showing conservativity results for justification logics of belief
(Kuznets 2000, Kuznets 2008, Milnikel 2007, Milnikel 2009). Complexity
results have further been used to address the problem of logical
omniscience.</p>

<h3><a id="OntTraSem">3.5 Ontologically Transparent Semantics</a></h3>

<p>The formal semantics for Justification Logic described above in
3.1&ndash;3.4 defines truth value at a given world \(\Gamma\) the same
way it is done in Awareness Models: \(t{:}F\) holds at \(\Gamma\)
iff</p>

<ol>
<li><p>\(F\) holds at all worlds accessible from \(\Gamma\) and</p></li>
<li><p>\(t\) is admissible evidence for \(F\) according to the given
evidence function.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, there is a different kind of semantics, so-called
modular semantics, which focuses on making more transparent the
ontological status of justifications. Within modular semantics
propositions receive the usual classical truth values and
justifications are interpreted syntactically as sets of formulas. We
retain a classical interpretation \(\ast\) of the propositional
formulas \(Fm\), which, in the case of a single world, reduces to
\[\ast: Fm \mapsto\ \ \{0,1\}\] i.e., each formula gets a truth value
0 (false) or 1 (true), with the usual Boolean conditions:
\({\Vdash}A\rightarrow B\) iff \(\not\Vdash A\) or \({\Vdash}B\),
etc. The principal issue is how to interpret justification
terms. For <em>sets of formulas</em> \(X\) and \(Y\), we define
\[X\cdot Y = \{ F \mid G{\rightarrow}F \in X\ \mbox{and} \ G \in Y\
\mbox{for some}\ G\}.\] Informally, \(X\cdot Y\) is the result of
applying <em>Modus Ponens</em> once between all members of \(X\) and
of \(Y\) (in that order). Justification terms <em>Tm</em> are
interpreted as subsets of the set of formulas: \[\ast: Tm \mapsto\ \
2^{Fm}\] such that \[(s\cdot t)^\ast\supseteq s^\ast\cdot t^\ast \ \
\mbox{and}\ \ \ (s+t)^\ast\supseteq s^\ast\cup t^\ast .\] These
conditions correspond to the basic justification logic \(\textsf{J}\);
other systems require additional closure properties of \(\ast\). Note
that whereas propositions in modular models are interpreted
semantically, as truth values, justifications are interpreted
syntactically, as sets of formulas. This is a principal hyperintensional feature: a
modular model may treat distinct formulas \(F\) and \(G\) as equal in
the sense that \(F^\ast = G^\ast\), but still be able to distinguish
justification assertions \(t{:}F\) and \(t{:}G\), for example when \(F
\in t^\ast\) but \(G\not\in t^\ast\) yielding \({\Vdash}t{:}F\) but
\(\not\Vdash t{:}G\). In the general possible world setting, formulas
are interpreted classically as subsets of the set \(W\) of possible
worlds, \[\ast: Fm \mapsto\ \ 2^W ,\] and justification terms are
interpreted syntactically as sets of formulas at each world \[\ast:
W\times Tm \mapsto\ \ 2^{Fm}.\] Soundness and completeness of
Justification Logic systems with respect to modular models have been
demonstrated in <span class="citation">Artemov (2012; Kuznets and
Studer 2012)</span>.</p>

<h3><a id="ConAwaMod">3.6 Connections with Awareness Models</a></h3>

<p>The logical omniscence problem is that in epistemic logics all
tautologies are known and knowledge is closed under consequence, which
is unreasonable. In <span class="citation">Fagin and Halpern
(1988)</span> a simple mechanism for avoiding the problems was
introduced. One adds to the usual Kripke model structure an awareness
function \(\cal A\) indicating for each world which formulas the agent
is aware of at this world. Then a formula is taken to be known at a
possible world \(\Gamma\) if 1) the formula is true at all worlds
accessible from \(\Gamma\) (the Kripkean condition for knowledge) and
2) the agent is aware of the formula at \(\Gamma\). Awareness
functions can serve as a practical tool for blocking knowledge of an
arbitrary set of formulas. However as logical structures, awareness
models can exhibit unusual behavior due to the lack of natural closure
properties. For example, the agent can know \(A\wedge B\) but be aware
of nether \(A\) nor \(B\) and hence not know either.</p>

<p>Possible world justification logic models use a forcing definition
reminiscent of the one from the awareness models: for any given
justification \(t\) the justification assertion \(t{:}F\) holds at
world \(\Gamma\) iff 1) \(F\) holds at all worlds \(\Delta\)
accessible from \(\Gamma\) and 2) \(t\) is admissible evidence for
\(F\) at \(\Gamma\), \(\Gamma\in{\cal E}(t,F)\). The principal
difference is in the operations on justifications and corresponding
closure conditions on admissible evidence function \(\cal E\) in
Justification Logic models, which may hence be regarded as a dynamic
version of awareness models which necessary closure properties
specified. This idea has been explored
in <span class="citation">Sedl&aacute;r (2013)</span> which worked
with the language of \(\textsf{LP}\), thinking of it as a multi-agent
modal logic, and taking justification terms as agents (more properly,
actions of agents). This shows that Justification Logic models absorb
the usual epistemic themes of awareness, group agency and dynamics in
a natural way.</p>

<h2><a id="ReaThe">4. Realization Theorems</a></h2>

<p>

The natural modal epistemic counterpart of the evidence assertion 
\(t : F\) is \(\Box F\), read <em>for some x, 
x</em>:\(F\). This observation leads to the notion of 
<em>forgetful projection</em> which replaces each occurrence of 
\(t : F\) by \(\Box F\) and hence converts a 
Justification Logic sentence \(S\) to a corresponding Modal 
Logic sentence \(S^{o}\). The forgetful 
projection extends in the natural way from sentences to logics.</p>

<p>

Obviously, different Justification Logic sentences may have the same 
forgetful projection, hence \(S^{o}\) loses 
certain information that was contained in \(S\). However, it is 
easily observed that the forgetful projection always maps valid 
formulas of Justification Logic (e.g., axioms of
 \(\mathsf{J})\)
 to valid formulas of a corresponding
Epistemic Logic \((\mathsf{K}\) 
in this case). The converse also holds: any valid formula of 
Epistemic Logic is the forgetful projection of some valid formula of 
Justification Logic. This follows from the Correspondence Theorem 3.</p>

<p class="indent">
  <strong>Theorem 3</strong>:
 \(\mathsf{J}^{o} = \mathsf{K}\).
</p>

<p>

This correspondence holds for other pairs of Justification and 
Epistemic systems, for instance
 \(\mathsf{J4}\) and
 \(\mathsf{K4}\), or
 \(\mathsf{LP}\) and
 \(\mathsf{S4}\),
 and many others. In such extended form, the 
Correspondence Theorem shows that major modal logics such as
 \(\mathsf{K} , \mathsf{T} , \mathsf{K4} , \mathsf{S4} , \mathsf{K45} , \mathsf{S5}\)
 and some others have exact Justification Logic 
counterparts.</p>

<p>

At the core of the Correspondence Theorem is the following 
Realization Theorem.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem 4</strong>: There is an algorithm which, for each
modal formula \(F\) derivable in
 \(\mathsf{K}\), assigns evidence terms to each occurrence of
modality in \(F\) in such a way that the resulting formula
\(F^{r}\) is derivable in
 \(\mathsf{J}\). Moreover, the realization assigns evidence
variables to the negative occurrences of modal operators in \(F\), thus
respecting the existential reading of epistemic modality.
</p>

<p>

Known realization algorithms which recover evidence terms in modal 
theorems use cut-free derivations in the corresponding modal logics. 
Alternatively, the Realization Theorem can be established 
semantically by Fitting&rsquo;s method or its proper modifications. 
In principle, these semantic arguments also produce 
realization procedures which are based on exhaustive search.</p>

<p>

It would be a mistake to draw the conclusion that 
<strong>any</strong> modal logic has a reasonable Justification Logic
counterpart. For example the logic of formal provability,
 \(\mathsf{GL}\), (Boolos 1993) contains
the <em>L&ouml;b Principle</em>:</p>

\[\tag{5}
\Box ( \Box F \rightarrow F ) \rightarrow \Box F,
\]

<p>

which does not seem to have an epistemically acceptable explicit 
version. Consider, for example, the case where \(F\) is the 
propositional constant \(\bot\)  for <em>false</em>. If an analogue of 
Theorem 4 would cover the L&ouml;b Principle there would be 
justification terms \(s\) and \(t\) such that 
\(x :( s : \bot \rightarrow \bot ) \rightarrow t : \bot\) . 
But this is intuitively false for factive justification. Indeed, 
\(s : \bot \rightarrow \bot\)  is an instance of the Factivity Axiom.
Apply Axiom Internalization to obtain 
\(c :( s : \bot \rightarrow \bot )\) for some constant 
\(c\). This choice of \(c\) makes the antecedent of 
\(c :( s : \bot \rightarrow \bot ) \rightarrow t : \bot\)  
intuitively true and the conclusion 
 false<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>.
 In particular, the L&ouml;b Principle (5) is not valid for the proof 
interpretation (cf. (Goris 2007) for a full account of which 
principles of \(\mathsf{GL}\) are
realizable).</p>

<p>

The Correspondence Theorem gives fresh insight into epistemic modal 
logics. Most notably, it provides a new semantics for the major modal
logics. In addition to the traditional Kripke-style 
&lsquo;universal&rsquo; reading of \(\Box F\) as <em>F holds 
in all possible situations</em>, there is now a rigorous 
&lsquo;existential&rsquo; semantics for \(\Box F\) that can be
read as <em>there is a witness (proof, justification) for F</em>.</p>

<p>

Justification semantics plays a similar role in Modal Logic to that 
played by Kleene realizability in Intuitionistic Logic. In both 
cases, the intended semantics is <strong>existential</strong>: the 
Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation of Intuitionistic Logic 
(Heyting 1934, Troelstra and van Dalen 1988, van Dalen 1986) and 
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s provability reading of
 \(\mathsf{S4}\) (G&ouml;del 1933, G&ouml;del 1938). In both 
cases there is a possible-world semantics of 
<strong>universal</strong> character which is a highly potent and 
dominant technical tool. It does not, however, address the 
existential character of the intended semantics. It took Kleene 
realizability (Kleene 1945, Troelstra 1998) to reveal the 
computational semantics of Intuitionistic Logic and the Logic of 
Proofs to provide exact BHK semantics of
proofs for Intuitionistic and Modal Logic.</p>

<p>

In the epistemic context, Justification Logic and the Correspondence 
Theorem add a new &lsquo;justification&rsquo; component to modal 
logics of knowledge and belief. Again, this new component was, in 
fact, an old and central notion which has been widely discussed by 
mainstream epistemologists but which remained out of the scope of 
classical epistemic logic. The Correspondence Theorem tells us that 
justifications are compatible with Hintikka-style systems and hence 
can be safely incorporated into the foundation for Epistemic Modal 
Logic.</p>

<h2><a id="Gen">5. Generalizations</a></h2>

<p>

So far in this article only single-agent justification logics, 
analogous to single-agent logics of knowledge, have been considered. 
Justification Logic can be thought of as logic of <em>explicit</em> 
knowledge, related to more conventional logics of <em>implicit</em> 
knowledge. A number of systems beyond those discussed above have been
investigated in the literature, involving multiple agents, or having 
both implicit and explicit operators, or some combination of these.</p> 

<h3><a id="MixExpImpKno">5.1 Mixing Explicit and Implicit Knowledge</a></h3>

<p>

Since justification logics provide explicit justifications, while
conventional logics of knowledge provide an implicit knowledge
operator, it is natural to consider combining the two in a single
system. The most common joint logic of explicit and implicit knowledge
is \(\mathsf{S4LP}\) (Artemov and Nogina 2005). The language of
\(\mathsf{S4LP}\) is like that of \(\mathsf{LP}\), but with an
implicit knowledge operator added, written either \(\mathbf{K}\) or
\(\Box\) . The axiomatics is like that of \(\mathsf{LP}\), combined
with that of \(\mathsf{S4}\) for the implicit operator, together with
a connecting axiom, \(t : X \rightarrow \Box X\), anything that has an
explicit justification is knowable.</p>

<p>

Semantically, possible world justification models for
 \(\mathsf{LP}\) need no modification, since they already have 
all the machinery of Hintikka/Kripke models. One models the \(\Box\)  
operator in the usual way, making use of just the accessibility 
relation, and one models the justification terms as described in 
Section 3.1 using both accessibility and the evidence function. Since 
the usual condition for \(\Box X\) being true at a world is 
one of the two clauses of the condition for \(t : X\) 
being true, this immediately yields the validity of 
\(t : X \rightarrow \Box X\), and soundness follows
easily. Axiomatic completeness is also rather straightforward.</p>

<p>

In \(\mathsf{S4LP}\) both implicit and explicit knowledge is
represented, but in possible world justification model semantics a
single accessibility relation serves for both. This is not the only
way of doing it. More generally, an explicit knowledge accessibility
relation could be a proper extension of that for implicit
knowledge. This represents the vision of explicit knowledge as having
stricter standards for what counts as known than that of implicit
knowledge. Using different accessibility relations for explicit and
implicit knowledge becomes necessary when these epistemic notions obey
different logical laws, e.g., \(\mathsf{S5}\) for implicit knowledge
and \(\mathsf{LP}\) for explicit.  The case of multiple accessibility
relations is commonly known in the literature as Artemov-Fitting
models, but will be called multi-agent possible world models
here. (cf. Section 5.2).</p>

<p>

Curiously, while the logic
 \(\mathsf{S4LP}\) seems quite natural, a Realization Theorem 
has been problematic for it: no such theorem can be proved if one 
insists on what are called <em>normal</em> realizations (Kuznets 
2010). Realization of implicit knowledge modalities in
 \(\mathsf{S4LP}\) by explicit 
justifications which would respect the epistemic structure remains a 
major challenge in this area.</p>

<p>

Interactions between implicit and explicit knowledge can sometimes be
rather delicate. As an example, consider the following mixed 
principle of negative introspection (again \(\Box\)  should be read as 
an implicit epistemic operator),</p>

\[\tag{6}
\neg t : X \rightarrow \Box \neg t : X.
\]

<p>

From the provability perspective, it is the right form of negative 
introspection. Indeed, let \(\Box F\) be interpreted as <em>F 
is provable</em> and \(t : F\) as <em>t is a proof of 
F</em> in a given formal theory \(T\), e.g., in Peano Arithmetic
\(\mathsf{PA}\). Then (6) states 
a provable principle. Indeed, if \(t\) is not a proof of 
\(F\) then, since this statement is decidable, it can be 
established inside \(T\), hence in \(T\) this sentence is 
provable. On the other hand, the proof \(p\) of 
&lsquo;\(t\) is not a proof of \(F\)&rsquo; depends on both
\(t\) and \(F , p = p ( t , F)\) and 
cannot be computed given \(t\) only. In this respect, \(\Box\)  
cannot be replaced by any specific proof term depending on \(t\)
only and (6) cannot be presented in an entirely explicit 
justification-style format.</p>

<p>

The first examples of explicit/implicit knowledge systems appeared in
the area of provability logic. In (Sidon 1997, Yavorskaya (Sidon) 
2001), a logic \(\mathsf{LPP}\) 
was introduced which combined the logic of provability
 \(\mathsf{GL}\) with the logic of 
proofs \(\mathsf{LP}\), but to 
ensure that the resulting system had desirable logical properties 
some <em>additional operations</em> from outside the original 
languages of \(\mathsf{GL}\) and 
\(\mathsf{LP}\) were added. In 
(Nogina 2006, Nogina 2007) a complete logical system,
 \(\mathsf{GLA}\), for proofs and 
provability was offered, in the sum of the <em>original 
languages</em> of \(\mathsf{GL}\)
and
 \(\mathsf{LP}\). Both
 \(\mathsf{LPP}\) and
 \(\mathsf{GLA}\)
 enjoy completeness relative to the 
class of arithmetical models, and also relative to the class of 
possible world justification models.</p>

<p>

Another example of a provability principle that cannot be made 
completely explicit is the L&ouml;b Principle (5). For each of
 \(\mathsf{LPP}\) and
 \(\mathsf{GLA}\),
 it is easy to find a proof term 
\(l ( x)\) such that</p>

\[\tag{7}
x :( \Box F \rightarrow F ) \rightarrow l ( x ): F
\]

<p>

holds. However, there is no realization which makes all 
<em>three</em> \(\Box\) s in (5) explicit. In fact, the set of 
realizable provability principles is the intersection of
 \(\mathsf{GL}\) and
 \(\mathsf{S4}\) (Goris 2007).</p>

<h3><a id="MulAgePosWorJusMod">5.2 Multi-Agent Possible World Justification Models</a></h3>

<p>

In <em>Multi-Agent possible world justification models</em> multiple
accessibility relations are employed, with connections between them,
(Artemov 2006). The idea is, there are multiple agents, each with an
implicit knowledge operator, and there are justification terms, which
each agent understands. Loosely, everybody understands explicit
reasons; these amount to <em>evidence-based common knowledge</em>.</p>

<p>

An \(n\)-agent possible world justification model is a structure
 \(\langle \mathcal{G} , \mathcal{R}_{1}\), &hellip;,\(\mathcal{R}_{n}
 , \mathcal{R} , \mathcal{E} , \mathcal{V}\rangle\) meeting the
 following conditions.  \(\mathcal{G}\) is a set of possible
 worlds. Each of \(\mathcal{R}_{1}\),&hellip;,\(\mathcal{R}_{n}\) is
 an accessibility relation, one for each agent. These may be assumed
 to be reflexive, transitive, or symmetric, as desired. They are used
 to model implicit agent knowledge for the family of agents. The
 accessibility relation \(\mathcal{R}\) meets the \(\mathsf{LP}\)
 conditions, reflexivity and transitivity. It is used in the modeling
 of explicit knowledge.  \(\mathcal{E}\) is an evidence function,
 meeting the same conditions as those for \(\mathsf{LP}\) in Section
 3.3. \(\mathcal{V}\) maps propositional letters to sets of worlds, as
 usual. There is a special condition imposed: for each \(i\) = 1,
 &hellip;,\(n , \mathcal{R}_{i} \subseteq \mathcal{R}\).</p>

<p>

If \(\mathcal{M} = \langle \mathcal{G} , \mathcal{R}_{1}\),
 &hellip;,\(\mathcal{R}_{n} , \mathcal{R} , \mathcal{E} ,
 \mathcal{V}\rangle\) is a multi-agent possible world justification
 model a truth-at-a-world relation, \(\mathcal{M} , \Gamma \Vdash X\),
 is defined with most of the usual clauses. The ones of particular
 interest are these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    \(\mathcal{M} , \Gamma \Vdash K_{i}X\) if and only if, 
    for every \(\Delta \in \mathcal{G}\) with
    \(\Gamma \mathcal{R}_{i} \Delta\), we have that \(\mathcal{M} , \Delta \Vdash X\).
  </li>
  <li>
    \(\mathcal{M} , \Gamma \Vdash t : X\) if and only if \(\Gamma \in
    \mathcal{E} ( t , X)\) and, for every \(\Delta \in \mathcal{G}\)
    with \(\Gamma \mathcal{R} \Delta\), we have that \(\mathcal{M} ,
    \Delta \Vdash X\).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>

The condition \(\mathcal{R}_{i} \subseteq \mathcal{R}\) entails the validity of 
\(t : X \rightarrow K_{i}X\), for each agent \(i\).
If there is only a single agent, and the accessibility relation for 
that agent is reflexive and transitive, this provides another 
semantics for \(\mathsf{S4LP}\). 
Whatever the number of agents, each agent accepts explicit reasons as
establishing knowledge.</p>

<p>

A version of \(\mathsf{LP}\) with
two agents was introduced and studied in (Yavorskaya (Sidon) 
2008), though it can be generalized to any finite number of agents. In
this, each agent has its own set of justification operators, 
variables, and constants, rather than having a single set for 
everybody, as above. In addition some limited communication between 
agents may be permitted, using a new operator that allows one agent 
to verify the correctness of the other agent&rsquo;s justifications. 
Versions of both single world and more general possible world
justification semantics were created for the two-agent logics. This
involves a straightforward extension of the notion of an evidence
function, and for possible world justification models, using two
accessibility relations. Realization theorems have been proved
syntactically, though presumably a semantic proof would also work.</p>

<p>

There has been some recent exploration of the role of public 
announcements in multi-agent justification logics (Renne 2008, Renne 
2009).</p>

<p>

There is more on the notion of evidence-based common knowledge in
Section 5 of the supplementary document
 <a href="supplement.html">Some More Technical Matters</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="RusExaIndFac">6. Russell&rsquo;s Example: Induced Factivity</a></h2>

<p>

There is a technique for using Justification Logic to analyze 
different justifications for the same fact, in particular when some 
of the justifications are factive and some are not. To demonstrate 
the technique consider a well-known example:</p>

<blockquote>
  If a man believes that the late Prime Minister&rsquo;s last name began
  with a &lsquo;B,&rsquo; he believes what is true, since the late
  Prime Minister was Sir Henry Campbell
  Bannerman<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>. 
  But if he believes that Mr. Balfour was
  the late Prime
  Minister<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>,
  he will still believe that the late
  Prime Minister&rsquo;s last name began with a &lsquo;B,&rsquo; yet this
  belief, though true, would not be thought to constitute
  knowledge. (Russell 1912)
</blockquote>

<p>

As in the Red Barn Example, discussed in Section 1.1, here one has to
deal with two justifications for a true statement, one of which is 
correct and one of which is not. Let \(B\) be a sentence 
(propositional atom), \(w\) be a designated justification 
variable for the wrong reason for \(B\) and \(r\) a 
designated justification variable for the right (hence factive) 
reason for \(B\). Then, Russell&rsquo;s example prompts the following 
set of 
 assumptions<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>:
 </p>

\[
\mathcal{R} = \{w : B , r : B , r : B \rightarrow B\}
\]

<p>

Somewhat counter to intuition, one can logically deduce factivity of 
\(w\) from \(\mathcal{R}\):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    \(r : B\) (assumption)
  </li>
  <li>
    \(r : B \rightarrow B\) (assumption)
  </li>
  <li>
    \(B\) (from 1 and 2 by Modus Ponens)
  </li>
  <li>
    \(B \rightarrow ( w : B \rightarrow B)\) (propositional axiom)
  </li>
  <li>
    \(w : B \rightarrow B\) (from 3 and 4 by Modus Ponens)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>

However, this derivation utilizes the fact that \(r\) is a 
factive justification for \(B\) to conclude 
\(w : B \rightarrow B\), which constitutes a case of 
&lsquo;induced factivity&rsquo; for \(w : B\). The 
question is, how can one distinguish the &lsquo;real&rsquo; factivity
of \(r : B\) from the &lsquo;induced factivity&rsquo; of 
\(w : B\) ? Some sort of evidence-tracking is needed here, 
and Justification Logic is an appropriate tool. The natural approach 
is to consider the set of assumptions <strong>without</strong> 
\(r : B\), i.e.,</p>

\[
\mathcal{S} = \{w: B, r :B \rightarrow B\}
\]

<p>

and establish that factivity of \(w\), i.e., 
\(w : B \rightarrow B\) is not derivable from
 \(\mathcal{S}\). Here is a possible world justification model
 \(\mathcal{M}\) =
 \((\mathcal{G} , \mathcal{R} , \mathcal{E} , \mathcal{V})\) in which
 \(\mathcal{S}\) 
holds but \(w : B \rightarrow B\) does not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(\mathcal{G} = \{\mathbf{1}\}\),</li>
  <li>\(\mathcal{R} = \varnothing\) ,</li>
  <li>\(\mathcal{V} ( B)\) = \(\varnothing\)  (and so
  not-\(\mathbf{1} \Vdash B)\),</li>
  <li>\(\mathcal{E} ( t , F)\) =
  \(\{\mathbf{1}\}\) for all pairs \((t , F)\) except
  \((r , B)\),and</li>
  <li>\(\mathcal{E} ( r , B)\) = \(\varnothing\) .</li>
</ul>

<p>

It is easy to see that the closure conditions <em>Application</em> 
and <em>Sum</em> on \(\mathcal{E}\) are fulfilled. At
\(\mathbf{1} , w : B\) holds, i.e.,</p>

\[
\mathbf{1} \Vdash w : B
\]

<p>

since \(w\) is admissible evidence for \(B\) at 
\(\mathbf{1}\) and there are no possible worlds accessible from 
\(\mathbf{1}\). Furthermore,</p>

\[
  \text{not-}\mathbf{1} \Vdash r : B
\]

<p>

since, according to \(\mathcal{E} , r\) is 
not admissible evidence for \(B\) at \(\mathbf{1}\). Hence:</p>

\[
\mathbf{1} \Vdash r : B \rightarrow B
\]

<p>

On the other hand,</p>

\[
  \text{not-}\mathbf{1} \Vdash w : B \rightarrow B
\]

<p>

since \(B\) does not hold at \(\mathbf{1}\).</p>

<h2><a id="SelRefJus">7. Self-referentiality of justifications</a></h2>

<p>

The Realization algorithms sometimes produce Constant Specifications 
containing self-referential justification assertions 
\(c : A ( c)\), that is, assertions in which the 
justification (here \(c)\) occurs in the asserted proposition 
(here \(A ( c))\).</p>

<p>

Self-referentiality of justifications is a new phenomenon which is 
not present in the conventional modal language. In addition to being 
intriguing epistemic objects, such self-referential assertions 
provide a special challenge from the semantical viewpoint because of 
the built-in vicious circle. Indeed, to evaluate \(c\) one would
expect first to evaluate \(A\) and then assign a justification 
object for \(A\) to \(c\). However, this cannot be done 
since \(A\) contains \(c\) which is yet to be evaluated. 
The question of whether or not modal logics can be realized without 
using self-referential justifications was a major open question in 
this area.</p>

<p>

The principal result by Kuznets in (Brezhnev and Kuznets 2006) states
that self-referentiality of justifications is unavoidable in 
realization of \(\mathsf{S4}\) in
\(\mathsf{LP}\). The current 
state of things is given by the following theorem due to Kuznets:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem 5</strong>: Self-referentiality can be avoided in
realizations of modal logics
 \(\mathsf{K}\) and
 \(\mathsf{D}\).
 Self-referentiality cannot be avoided in
realizations of modal logics
 \(\mathsf{T} , \mathsf{K4} , \mathsf{D4}\)
 and
 \(\mathsf{S4}\).
</p>

<p>

This theorem establishes that a system of justification terms for 
\(\mathsf{S4}\) will necessarily 
be self-referential. This creates a serious, though not directly 
visible, constraint on provability semantics. In the G&ouml;delian 
context of arithmetical proofs, the problem was coped with by a 
general method of assigning arithmetical semantics to 
self-referential assertions \(c : A ( c)\) stating
that \(c\) is a proof of \(A ( c)\). In the Logic of
Proofs \(\mathsf{LP}\) it was 
dealt with by a non-trivial fixed-point construction.</p>

<p>

Self-referentiality gives an interesting perspective on Moore&rsquo;s 
Paradox. See Section 6 of the
supplementary document
 <a href="supplement.html">Some More Technical Matters</a>
 for details.</p>

<p>
The question of the self-referentiality of BHK-semantics for
intuitionistic logic \(\mathsf{IPC}\) has been answered by Junhua Yu
(Yu 2014).  Extending Kuznets&rsquo; method, he established</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem 6</strong>: Each \(\mathsf{LP}\) realization of the
intuitionistic law of double negation \(\neg\neg(\neg\neg p
\rightarrow p)\) requires self referential constant
specifications.</p>

More generally, Yu has proved that any double negation of a classical
tautology (by Glivenko&rsquo;s Theorem all of them are theorems of
\(\mathsf{IPC}\)) needs self-referential constant specifications for
its realization in \(\mathsf{LC}\).  Another example of unavoidable
self-referentiality was found by Yu in the purely implicational
fragment of \(\mathsf{IPC}\).  This suggests that the BHK semantics of
intuitionistic logic (even just of intuitionistic implication) is
intrinsically self-referential and needs a fixed-point construction to
connect it to formal proofs in PA or similar systems.  This might
explain, in part, why any attempt to build provability BHK semantics
in a direct inductive manner without self-referentiality was doomed to
failure.

<h2><a id="QuaJusLog">8. Quantifiers in Justification Logic</a></h2>

<p>

While the investigation of propositional Justification Logic is far 
from complete, there has also been some work on first-order 
versions. Quantified versions of Modal Logic already offer 
complexities beyond standard first-order logic. Quantification has an
even broader field to play when Justification Logics are involved. 
Classically one quantifies over &lsquo;objects,&rsquo; and models are
equipped with a domain over which quantifiers range. Modally one 
might have a single domain common to all possible worlds, or one 
might have separate domains for each world. The role of the Barcan 
formula is well-known here. Both constant and varying domain options 
are available for Justification Logic as well. In addition there is a
possibility that has no analog for Modal Logic: one might quantify 
over justifications themselves.</p>

<p>

Initial results concerning the possibility of Quantified 
Justification Logic were notably unfavorable. The arithmetical 
provability semantics for the Logic of Proofs
 \(\mathsf{LP}\), naturally generalizes to a 
first-order version with conventional quantifiers, and to a version 
with quantifiers over proofs. In both cases, axiomatizability 
questions were answered negatively.</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem 7</strong>: The first-order logic of proofs is not
recursively enumerable (Artemov and Yavorskaya (Sidon) 2001). The
logic of proofs with quantifiers over proofs is not recursively
enumerable (Yavorsky 2001).
</p>

<p>

Although an arithmetic semantics is not possible, in (Fitting 2008) a
possible world semantics, and an axiomatic proof theory, was given for 
a version of \(\mathsf{LP}\) with
quantifiers ranging over justifications. Soundness and completeness 
were proved. At this point possible world semantics separates from 
arithmetic semantics, which may or may not be a cause for alarm. It 
was also shown that
 \(\mathsf{S4}\)
 embeds into the quantified logic by translating
\(\Box Z\) as &ldquo;there exists a justification \(x\) 
such that \(x : Z^{*}\),&rdquo; where 
\(Z^{*}\) is the translation of \(Z\). While this 
logic is somewhat complicated, it has found applications, e.g., in 
(Dean and Kurokawa 2009b) it is used to analyze the Knower Paradox, 
though objections have been raised to this analysis in (Arlo-Costa 
and Kishida 2009).</p>

<p>A First-Order Logic of Proofs, \(\textsf{FOLP}\), with quantifiers
over individual variables, has been presented
in <span class="citation">Artemov and Yavorskaya (Sidon)
(2011)</span>. In \(\textsf{FOLP}\) proof assertions are represented
by formulas of the form \(t{:}_X A\) where \(X\) is a finite set of
individual variables that are considered global parameters open for
substitution. All occurrences of variables from \(X\) that are free in
\(A\) are also free in \(t{:}_X A\). All other free variables of \(A\)
are considered local and hence bound in \(t{:}_X A\). For example, if
\(A(x,y)\) is an atomic formula, then in \(p{:}_{\{x\}} A(x,y)\)
variable \(x\) is free and variable \(y\) is bound. Likewise, in
\(p{:}_{\{x,y\}} A(x,y)\) both variables are free, and in
\(p{:}_{\emptyset} A(x,y)\) neither \(x\) nor \(y\) is free.</p>

<p>Proofs (justifications) are represented by proof terms which do not
contain individual variables. In addition to \(\textsf{LP}\)
operations there is one more series of operations on proof terms,
\({\sf gen}_x(t)\), corresponding to generalization over individual
variable \(x\). The new axiom that governs this operation is \(t{:}_X
A {\rightarrow}{\sf gen{:}_x(t)}_X\forall x A\), with \(x\not\in
X\). The complete list of \(\textsf{FOLP}\) principles along with
realization of First-Order \(\textsf{S4}\) can be found
in <span class="citation">Artemov and Yavorskaya (Sidon)
(2011)</span>. A semantics for \(\textsf{FOLP}\) has been developed
in <span class="citation">Fitting (2014a)</span>.</p>

<h2><a id="HisNot">9. Historical Notes</a></h2>

<p>

The initial Justification Logic system, the Logic of Proofs
 \(\mathsf{LP}\),
 was introduced in 1995 in (Artemov 1995) (cf. 
also (Artemov 2001)) where such basic properties as Internalization, 
Realization, arithmetical completeness, were first established.
\(\mathsf{LP}\) offered an intended
provability semantics for G&ouml;del&rsquo;s provability logic
 \(\mathsf{S4}\),
 thus providing a formalization of Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov
semantics for intuitionistic propositional logic. 
Epistemic semantics and completeness (Fitting 2005) were first 
established for \(\mathsf{LP}\). 
Symbolic models and decidability for
 \(\mathsf{LP}\)
 are due to Mkrtychev (Mkrtychev 1997). 
Complexity estimates first appeared in (Brezhnev and Kuznets 2006, 
Kuznets 2000, Milnikel 2007). A comprehensive overview of all 
decidability and complexity results can be found in (Kuznets 2008). 
Systems \(\mathsf{J} , \mathsf{J4}\), and
 \(\mathsf{JT}\)
 were first considered in (Brezhnev 
2001) under different names and in a slightly different setting. 
\(\mathsf{JT45}\) appeared 
independently in (Pacuit 2006) and (Rubtsova 2006), and
 \(\mathsf{JD45}\) in (Pacuit 2006). The
logic of uni-conclusion proofs has been found in (Krupski 1997). 
A more general approach to common knowledge based on justified
knowledge was offered in (Artemov 2006).  Game
semantics of Justification Logic and Dynamic Epistemic Logic with 
justifications were studied in (Renne 2008, Renne 2009). Connections 
between Justification Logic and the problem of logical omniscience 
were examined in (Artemov and Kuznets 2009, Wang 2009).
The name <em>Justification Logic</em> was introduced in
(Artemov 2008), in which Kripke, Russell, and Gettier examples were
formalized; this formalization has been used for the resolution of
paradoxes, verification, hidden assumption analysis, and eliminating
redundancies.  In (Dean and Kurokawa 2009a), Justification Logic was
used for the analysis of Knower and Knowability paradoxes.
</p>

<p>
The first two monographs on Justification Logic were published in 2019
(Artemov and Fitting 2019, Kuznets and Studer 2019).</p>

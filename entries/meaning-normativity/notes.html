<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">The Normativity of Meaning and Content</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a> The relations between
these notions are themselves a matter of debate. We assume that not
every truth about a certain matter <em>X</em> that is metaphysically
necessary, in the sense of being true in every (accessible) possible
world, is essential to <em>X</em>. Along with most participants in the
debate, we also take it that that which is conceptually necessary is
metaphysically necessary, but not necessarily vice versa. Thus, those
who argue that it is a conceptual truth that meaning is normative
usually think that this is sufficient to show that meaning is
essentially normative. But not everyone agrees. Wedgwood (2009, 424),
for instance, argues that the claim that normativity is built into our
concept of meaning/content could be true even if the corresponding
metaphysical claim was false. See also Gibbard (2012) who argues that
while the <em>concept</em> of meaning is normative, the property of
meaning is not normative. Gibbard therefore does not accept meaning
normativism as discussed in this entry.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>  The neutral claim might
also be true without either norms or meaning/content being prior to
the other: If something else, <em>X</em>, is such that there is both
meaning/content and the norms in question are in force
<em>because</em> <em>X</em> is the case. In this case, however, it is
arguably <em>X</em> that is essential to meaning/content, and not the
norms.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>  Gl&uuml;er &amp;
Wikforss (2009) carves out (part of) the same terrain in a slightly
different, purely systematic way, treating CE and CD normativism as
mutually exclusive claims implying opposite directions of metaphysical
determination. The current, wider use of &lsquo;ME/CE
normativity&rsquo; allows for the combination of ME/CE and MD/CD
normativism and is entirely due to the actual shape of the debate to
be outlined in this article.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>  Soames (1997), for
instance, distinguishes between determination by relations of
necessary consequence and by relations of a priori consequence. He
argues that the argument Kripke's skeptic provides against determinate
meaning facts suffers from equivocation between these two readings of
determination (Soames 1997, 222ff, esp. 232).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>  Such principles can be
of different kinds. For instance, they can be more or less
holistic. According to a holistic determination principle for
linguistic meaning the meanings of all the expressions of a language
are determined together and by the whole of what is in
<em>S<sub>B</sub></em> (cf. Pagin 1997). They can determine a single
correct mapping, or effect rankings between different mappings
according to some standard of &ldquo;best fit&rdquo; (for instance,
being most &ldquo;charitable&rdquo; (Davidson 1973) or providing the
best teleo-biological explanation (Millikan 1990, Neander 1995, Dretske
1986), thus potentially leaving an opening for indeterminacy (i.e. the
possibitity of more than one equally good
&ldquo;best&rdquo; mapping).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a> This is not completely
uncontroversial. For a discussion of some related issues, see Gibbard
1994. Wedgwood (2009, 425) voices some doubts. Jackson (2000) argues
that non-cognitivism cannot be combined with the claim that belief is
subject to constraints of rationality, where &lsquo;rational&rsquo; is
understood as a normative term. Gibbard (2012) provides a detailed
proposal for how an expressivist analysis can be applied to statements
about meaning and mental content on the assumption that such
statements are normative. For some skepticism about extending
expressivism to meaning and content statements, see Hattiangadi
forthcoming.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>  Cf. von Wright 1963, 14;
Schn&auml;delbach 1990, 83ff. In the German tradition, there is the
distinction between <em>Tun-Sollen</em> and
<em>Sein-Sollen</em>; see, for instance, Nicolai Hartmann's
<em>Ethik</em> (1925). See also G.E. Moore, &ldquo;The Nature of Moral
Philosophy&rdquo;, in his <em>Philosophical Studies</em> (1922).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>  Cf. Pagin 1987 for more on this.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>  However, ME normativity
need not be construed prescriptively. We return to this briefly
below.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a> Presumably, the notion
of application can be extended to other terms in a suitable way, so as
to allow the normativity thesis to apply to all meaningful
expressions. Whiting (2008) argues that semantic norms do not govern
the act of assertion but the more basic sentential act of producing a
sentence. This has the implication that merely voicing a sentence
could involve the violation of a semantic norm.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a> Peregrin (2012) defends
the claim that (CM) entails normativism on the grounds that the
concept of truth is to be analyzed in terms of correct
assertability. This goes beyond the simple argument since it
presupposes a controversial analysis of the concept of truth. However,
notice, even if one accepts the analysis and agrees that the central
notion of semantic correctness is that of warranted asertibility, it
remains to be shown that the latter notion is to be understood in
deontic terms.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a> In this context, it is
also sometimes pointed out that anti-normativists do not deny that
semantic categorization, like all categorization (such as sorting
objects into chairs and non-chairs) <em>can</em> be used to generate
normative consequences &mdash;<em> taken together with a
suitable norm</em>. For instance, it may be that we ought to speak the
truth. This norm, taken together with (CM), implies that <em>S</em>
ought to apply &lsquo;green&rsquo;only to green objects. However, the
normative force does then not derive from the categorization itself,
but from the categorization in conjunction with the relevant norm (c.f
Gl&uuml;er&amp;Wikforss 2009, 469).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a> Here are the three main
entries from Merriam-Webster: 1) true or accurate, agreeing with
facts, 2) having no errors or mistakes, 3) proper or appropriate in a
particular situation.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a> Moreover, to the extent
that there is a disanalogy, wouldn&rsquo;t it be due to the
(constitutive) nature of the <em>relation</em> between meaning and
correctness conditions? In which case one might wonder whether the
source of the normativity isn&rsquo;t precisely the constitutivity of
the relation, rather than meaning itself &mdash; as you would
get the same type of practical consequences whenever there is a
relation like that, independently of what the relata are.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>  This discussion is
also inspired by passages in the Wittgensteinian discussion of a pure
sense-datum language in <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>,
paragraphs 243&ndash;271. Here, Wittgenstein argues that such a language is
not possible because there would be no distinction between what seems
right to the speaker and what is right.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>  An alternative
reading of the notion of use in accordance with meaning is
&lsquo;transtemporal&rsquo;, and turns on the idea that there has to
be consistency over time. For instance, McGinn suggests that incorrect
use amounts to &lsquo;using the same expression with a different
meaning from that originally intended&rsquo; (1984: 60). One might try
to motivate the requirement on consistency over time by appealing to
considerations having to do with the determination of meaning; if so,
the resulting ME normativity derives from MD normativity. For a
criticism of this transtemporal construal see Boghossian 1989b and Whiting 2013.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>  This suggests a wide
scope reading of the deontic operator. It should be noted, though,
that since Millar replaces &lsquo;ought&rsquo; with &lsquo;is
committed&rsquo;, on his construal of ME normativity the relevant
normative consequences are not prescriptive.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a> For example, although
Gibbard (2012) construes meaning statements as having a prescriptive
content he denies that this has any metaphysical implications for the
nature of meaning. The slogan he defends, he writes, is &ldquo;the
concept of meaning is normative, whereas the property of meaning is
natural&rdquo;(ibid. 25). For a discussion see Wikforss (forthcoming-a).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>  Hattiangadi (2007:
194&ndash;195) also suggests that the proposal of Lance &amp; O'Leary
Hawthorne leads to a regress if construed as the thesis that the
prescriptive meaning sentences serve to determine meaning.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>  According to some,
this is the conclusion Kripke himself draws when presenting his
skeptical solution to the skeptical paradox (Wilson 2006: 161&ndash;163).
Kripke suggests that we should reject the search for meaning facts and
consider the conditions under which meaning statements are properly
assertible (Kripke 1982: 69&ndash;79). However, as noted above, the
anti-realist theory of meaning entails substantial metaphysical claims
about meaning, and this theory is no less in conflict with the
skeptical conclusion that there are no meaning facts than is the
classical realist theory (Boghossian 1989a: 522&ndash;527, Wright 1984:
769&ndash;770).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>  One reason the
prescriptive construal has played a central role derives from the
assumed connection between normativism and anti-naturalism. It is the
allegedly prescriptive character of meaning that is said to pose an
insurmountable obstacle to naturalist accounts of meaning (see section
4 below). However, to the extent that normativism poses a challenge to
naturalist accounts of meaning, it might also be that the axiological
construal of ME normativism poses such a challenge.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>  Assume that meaning
is ME normative, i.e. that an expression <em>e</em>'s having
meaning <em>M</em> entails a set of normative consequences
<em>N</em>, and that for each <em>M<sub>i</sub></em>, there is
precisely one distinctive set <em>N<sub>i</sub></em> such that,
necessarily, <em>e<sub>i</sub></em> has <em>M<sub>i</sub></em> iff
<em>N<sub>i</sub></em>. Does this mean that MD normativism is true? Not
necessarily; in this case, there is an equivalence relation between
<em>M<sub>i</sub></em> and <em>N<sub>i</sub></em>, which of course is a
determination relation, but for all we know so far, it may be of the
merely mathematical kind. To get MD normativism, the claim that
determination by norms is metaphysically &lsquo;responsible for&rsquo;,
or constitutive of, meaning needs to be added: It is <em>because</em>
of the norms that expressions have meaning, not vice versa.
Mathematical determination can be two-ways but metaphysical
determination is one way only.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a> Jackman
argues that the Davidsonian principle of charity is a normative
principle of meaning and content determination. Whether Davidson
espoused normativism about meaning/content is a matter of dispute,
however (see section 2.2.2 below).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>  Another question
about determination by normative facts arises from the commonly held
view that normative facts themselves supervene upon non-normative
facts. This might suggest that ultimately there is no real
metaphysical difference between what we might call normative and
non-normative determination. Greenberg 2005 suggests, by giving
examples, that there nevertheless is a distinction between levels of
metaphysical determination that are truly &ldquo;constitutive&rdquo;
of a phenomenon and those that are not. But even though a distinction
between what is essential and what is (merely) necessary (in the
&lsquo;metaphysical&rsquo; sense of true in all (accessible) possible
worlds) seems plausible at one and the same level of determination, it
is less clear that there is a corresponding distinction operating
between levels. The level at which we give an account of a phenomenon
might depend not so much on whether there is an underlying level of
determination but, among other things, on whether there is reduction
from one level to the next, as well as on the kind of account we are
interested in. Moreover, it would seem to be a metaphysically
interesting fact distinctive of a class of phenomena that there is
<em>a</em> level of determination in their metaphysical ancestry that
involves normative facts.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>  It is not immediately
clear that (MD) could be strengthened into a bi-conditional, at least
if such a bi-conditional is supposed to provide an <em>analysis</em>
of &lsquo;<em>e</em> means
<em>M</em>&rsquo;; for this, we would need to ensure that <em>R</em> is
of the right kind, for instance, that it is a semantic, not a pragmatic
rule, and that its being in force determines <em>M</em>, and not some
other, or no, meaning. It might not be possible to do this in an
informative way, however; for some arguments to this effect, see Pagin
(1987, 88&ndash;139).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a> Moreover, even if the
relation in question is conventional, it does not follow that it is
normative in the sense that interests a particular kind of meaning
normativist. According to David Lewis&rsquo;s influential account of
convention, for instance, a convention is a regularity in the behavior
of a community which is arbitrary but perpetuates itself because it
serves &ldquo;some sort of common purpose. Past conformity breeds
future conformity because it gives one a reason to go on
conforming&rdquo; (Lewis 1975, 4). This requires a degree of common
knowledge, but &mdash; prima facie at least &mdash; it
does not imply, for instance, that any prescription to conform is in
force in the community.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>  To illustrate:
According to Davidson, meaning supervenes upon non-semantic,
non-normative dispositions to hold (uninterpreted) sentences
true. This is a form of non-reductive naturalism. The principle by
which meaning so supervenes is the principle of charity.  Prima facie,
there is nothing incoherent about interpreting this, or any other
principle with the same function, as in some sense normative.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a> For a thorough
investigation of the concept of being in force regarding norms or
rules, cf. Pagin 1987, 12ff.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a> Cf. Jarvis 2012 for a
proposal regarding content determining normativity along such
lines.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a> Steglich-Petersen
(2013b) suggests that for belief formation to be guided by, for
instance, the truth rule the existence of a causal mechanism by means
of which relevant differences in output beliefs are effected is
sufficient. An analogous suggestion could be made for guidance by
meaning determining rules or norms. Gl&uuml;er &amp; Wikforss
(forthcoming) argue that, as long as we are concerned with an
intuitive conception of rule-following or rule-guidedness, the
possibility of deviant causal chains makes it highly improbable that
any true sufficiency claim will be forth-coming along these lines.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-31">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a> According to Ginsborg,
a primitively normative attitude is an intentional attitude, a
judgment even &mdash; thus preventing her account of meaning
(and content) determination from being fully reductive in the
naturalistic sense (2011a, 252). But it is a judgment only minimally
different from a brute, &ldquo;natural&rdquo; reaction, a judgment
&ldquo;not in the first instance to be identified with the acceptance
of some proposition as true&rdquo; (Ginsborg 2011b, 177). Its content
need not consist in more than an awareness of primitive
appropriateness in the form of &lsquo;<em>this</em> is appropriate to
<em>that</em>&rsquo; (cf. ibid., 169f; 2012, 137). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-32">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-32">32.</a> Primitive normativity
thus is a notion not only needed in an account of meaning
determination, but in any account of rule-following in
general. According to Ginsborg, &ldquo;it is only if we endorse the
pretheoretical intuitions on which I am relying [intuitions regarding
the primitive appropriateness of certain responses, but not others]
that we can make sense of there being justification in terms of rules
in the first place&rdquo; (2012, 249). Ginsborg&rsquo;s thought then
seems to be that we are <em>entitled</em> to our intuitive judgments
of primitive normativity precisely because there would be no
rule-following whatsoever unless these judgements were warranted
(cf. 2012, 240f; 249). On the assumption that meaningful use of
expressions indeed is a case of rule-following, an assumption quite
clearly implicit in Ginsborg&rsquo;s writings, this would of course
also hold for intuitive judgments of appropriateness regarding the use
of these expressions. Moreover, Ginsborg seems to hold not only that
the primitively normative attitudes required by meaning amount to
warranted judgments, but to judgments corresponding to objective
normative reality: &ldquo;on the position I shall defend&rdquo;, she
writes, &ldquo; expressions have meaning <em>only in virtue of there
being ways in which they ought to be applied</em>&rdquo; (2012, 132,
emph. added).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-33">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-33">33.</a> At times, it looks as
if Ginsborg wants to locate the difference exclusively in the
anti-extension: the anti-extension of the primitive notion of
correctness contains a &ldquo;broader class of responses&rdquo; than
that of the semantic notion of correctness. An example she gives is
that of reacting by sneezing: If we understand her correctly, it would
be primitively, but not semantically incorrect to react to the
question &lsquo;What is 68 + 57?&rsquo; by sneezing (cf. Ginsborg
2011b, 169, fn. 17, cf. also 2011a, 243).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-34">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-34">34.</a>  Boghossian (2003: 39)
withdraws his earlier claim that meaning is essentially normative,
suggesting that the &ldquo;the linguistic version of the normativity
thesis, in contrast with its mentalistic version, has no plausibility
whatever&hellip;&rdquo;. But see Boghossian (2008) where he argues
that there is a sense in which meaning is normative (as noted in
section 2.2.1 above).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-35">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-35">35.</a>  Again, it is not
immediately clear that (C) could be strengthened into a
bi-conditional, at least if such a bi-conditional is supposed to
provide an analysis of <em>M has content p</em>. Such an analysis
would have to specify the rule or norm in question without using the
concept of content. It is not clear, for instance, that the rules of
rational reasoning &ndash; which many think are promising candidates
here &ndash; themselves can be specified without using the concept of
content.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-36">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-36">36.</a>  Alex Byrne calls this
the &ldquo;pleonastic sense of &lsquo;concept&rsquo;&rdquo; (Byrne
2005). Note the contrast with the meaning of linguistic expressions
that this notion of concept induces: On this notion of concept, the
connection between a concept and &lsquo;its meaning&rsquo; or
&lsquo;its content&rsquo; is not arbitrary, or even contingent; quite
the contrary, a concept would naturally seem to <em>be</em> a meaning
or a content; the meaning or content of the corresponding linguistic
expression. There is here, thus, no route to normativism via
arbitrariness; rather, the idea of norms governing the
&lsquo;use&rsquo; of concepts seems to derive from the idea of
essential relations, such as inferential relations, between
contents.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-37">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-37">37.</a>  In the case of belief
there is also the general question of whether beliefs are voluntary in
the first place (Alston 1988, Shah &amp; Velleman 2005, Williams
1973, McHugh 2013; 2014). If not, the idea that belief is intrinsically prescriptive
stands in prima facie conflict with the principle that
&lsquo;ought&rsquo; implies &lsquo;can&rsquo;. In this respect both
(NB<sub>1</sub>) and (NB<sub>2</sub>) are, prima facie, more
problematic than (ME<sub>1</sub>), since the application of
expressions is something that is clearly within the voluntary control
of <em>S</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-38">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-38">38.</a>  Another proposal is
that the norm of belief is made conditional on <em>S</em> considering
whether <em>p</em>: &ldquo;If S considers whether <em>p</em>,
then <em>S</em> ought to believe <em>p</em> iff <em>p</em> is
true&rdquo; (Wedgwood 2002: 273). This proposal is criticized in
Bykvist &amp; Hattianagadi 2007: 281. For a response, see Wedgwood (2014).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-39">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-39">39.</a>  For a general
discussion of this idea, and its Aristotelian background, see
Korsgaard 1996. See also R&ouml;dl 2003 for an application to
intentional states.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-40">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-40">40.</a>  Another option would
be to regard the norms in question as merely axiological.  Thus, it
could be claimed that it is essential to belief, and constitutive of
content, that true, or knowledgeable, or rational belief is
intrinsically valuable (Karlander 2008). If this is meant to be a
conceptual a priori truth, it certainly is controversial, however.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-41">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-41">41.</a> Since the appeal to
teleological norms involves the idea that the norms constitutive of a
telos <em>determine</em> mental content it constitutes a form of CD
normativism (see section 3.2).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-42">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-42">42.</a>  So is
(NB<sub>2</sub>), of course, and the same questions concerning
guidance can be raised with respect to it.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-43">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-43">43.</a> For criticisms of the
so-called &ldquo;no-guidance argument&rdquo;, cf. Steglich-Petersen
2010; 2013a. For responses, see Gl&uuml;er &amp; Wikforss 2010;
2015b.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-44">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-44">44.</a> It has also been argued
that the problem concerning guidance is solved if (NB<sub>1</sub>) is
supplemented with the subjective norms of rationality:
(NB<sub>1</sub>) guides, but <em>via</em> these further norms
(Boghossian 2003: 39, Gibbard 2005: 343, Shah 2003: 471, Wedgwood
2002: 282). See section 3.2 below. For a critical discussion of the
appeal to subjective norms in defense of belief normativism see
Gl&uuml;er &amp; Wikforss (2015b).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-45">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-45">45.</a>  Note, also, that the
argument presupposes that conceptual necessity implies metaphysical
necessity. Otherwise it might be asked why the alleged conceptual
links between the concepts of content and belief should entail that
what is essential to belief is also essential to content.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-46">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-46">46.</a>  For a related
argument for the normativity of content see Greenberg (2007).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-47">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-47">47.</a>  Cf.  Willamson 2000,
238ff.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-48">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-48">48.</a> Therefore, he argues,
there is nothing problematic about the prima facie weird consequence
of objective epistemic normativity that every non-normative fact
whatsoever analytically entails a normative fact: You objectively
ought to believe that <em>p</em> iff <em>p</em>. See also Gibbard
(2012, 82&ndash;84) for a discussion of the relation between the subjective
ought and the objective ought.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-49">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-49">49.</a>  There is controversy
about the extent to which these integrate with one another,
controversy, that is, about the question as to whether epistemic value
is just one value among others determining the rationality of actions
and beliefs alike. Gibbard (2005), for instance, holds that it is,
while writers such as Owens (2003) and Shah &amp;Velleman (2005)
insist that the rationality of belief is solely determined by
epistemic value.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-50">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-50">50.</a>  It is instructive to
compare the contemporary debate between naturalists and normativists
about meaning, content, the propositional attitudes, or the
intentional in general with that between psychologists and
(neo-Kantian) normativists regarding the &lsquo;laws&rsquo; of logic
around the turn of the previous century. It is recorded in quite some
detail in Husserl's <em>Prolegomena</em> (1913). Husserl here came to
adopt a third position according to which these laws are neither
prescriptions nor psychological laws, but what he called
&ldquo;ideal&rdquo;. He greatly influenced Frege in this.</p>

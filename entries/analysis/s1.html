This supplement collects together various definitions and 
descriptions of analysis that have been offered in the history of 
philosophy (including all the classic ones), to indicate the range of
different conceptions and the issues that arise. (There are also some
remarks on related topics such as analyticity, definition, and 
methodology more generally.) In most cases, abbreviated references 
are given; full details can be found in the Annotated Bibliography on
Analysis, in the section mentioned in curly brackets after the 
relevant definition or description. Where there is more than one passage 
quoted from a particular author, passages are numbered in 
chronological order of composition (as far as that can be 
determined).</p>

<h3><a name="2">2. Descriptions of Analysis</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Alexander">Alexander of Aphrodisias</a></h4>

<ol>
<li><p>

And he [Aristotle] called them <em>Analytics</em> because the 
resolution of every compound into those things out of which the 
synthesis [is made] is called <em>analysis</em>. For analysis is the 
converse of synthesis. Synthesis is the road from the principles to 
those things that derive from the principles, and analysis is the 
return from the end to the principles. For geometers are said to 
<em>analyze</em> when, beginning from the conclusion they go up to 
the principles and the problem, following the order of those things 
which were assumed for the demonstration of the conclusion {1}. But 
he also uses analysis who reduces composite bodies into simple bodies
{2}, and he analyzes who divides the word into the parts of the word 
{3}; also he who divides the parts of the word into the syllables 
{4}; and he who divides these into their components {5}. And they are
severally said to analyse who reduce compound syllogisms into simple 
ones {6}, and simple ones into the premisses out of which they get 
their being {7}. And further, resolving imperfect syllogisms into 
perfect ones is called analyzing {8}. And they call analysis the 
reducing of the given syllogism into the proper schemata {9}. And it 
is especially in this meaning of analysis that these are entitled 
<em>Analytics</em>, for he describes for us a method at the end of 
the first book with which we shall be able to do this. 
(<em>Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s Prior Analytics</em>, 
&sect;1.2.1 (7, lines 11-33); tr. in Gilbert 1960, 32; the square 
brackets are in the original translation, the curly brackets have 
been added here to highlight the nine senses that Alexander 
distinguishes) 
 {<a href="bib2.html#2.4">&sect;2.4</a>,
 
 <a href="bib3.html#3.2">&sect;3.2</a>}
 </p></li></ol>

<h4><a name="Aristotle">Aristotle</a></h4>
<ol>
<li><p>


 <a name="AristotleSR"></a>it
 is not the same thing to take an argument in one&rsquo;s hand and 
then to see and solve its faults, as it is to be able to meet it 
quickly while being subjected to questions; for what we know, we 
often do not know in a different context. Moreover, just as in other 
things speed or slowness is enhanced by training, so it is with 
arguments too, so that supposing we are unpractised, even though a 
point is clear to us, we are often too late for the right moment. 
Sometimes too it happens as with diagrams; for there we can sometimes
analyse the figure, but not construct it again: so too in 
refutations, though we know on what the connexion of the argument 
depends, we still are at a loss to split the argument apart. 
(<em>SR</em>, 16, 175a20-30) 
 {<a href="bib2.html#2.4">&sect;2.4</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>


 <a name="AristotlePrA"></a>We
 must next explain how to reduce syllogisms to the figures previously 
described; this part of our inquiry still remains. For if we examine 
the means by which syllogisms are produced, and possess the ability 
to discover them, and can also analyse [<em>analuoimen</em>] the 
syllogisms when constructed into the figures previously described, 
our original undertaking will be completed. ((<em>PrA</em>, I, 32, 
46b40-47a6; Tredennick tr. slightly modified) 
 {<a href="bib2.html#2.4">&sect;2.4</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

Thus it is evident (1) that the types of syllogism which cannot be 
analysed in these figures [viz., second figure syllogisms into the 
third figure, and third figure syllogisms into the second figure] are
the same as those which we saw could not be analysed into the first 
figure; and (2) that when syllogisms are reduced to the first figure 
these alone are established <em>per impossibile</em>.</p>
<p>

It is evident, then, from the foregoing account [taken as including 
the discussion prior to chapter 45] how syllogisms should be reduced;
and also that the figures can be analysed into one another. 
(<em>PrA</em>, I, 45, 51a40-b5; Tredennick tr., substituting 
&lsquo;analysed&rsquo; for &lsquo;resolved&rsquo;) 
 {<a href="bib2.html#2.4">&sect;2.4</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>


 <a name="AristotlePoA"></a>If
 it were impossible to prove truth from falsehood, it would be easy to
make analyses [<em>analuein</em>]; for then the propositions would 
convert from necessity. Let <em>A</em> be something that is the case;
and if <em>A</em> is the case, then <em>these</em> things are the 
case (things which I know to be the case&mdash;call them <em>B</em>).
From the latter, then, I shall prove that the former is the case. (In
mathematics conversion is more common because mathematicians assume 
nothing incidental&mdash;and in this too they differ from those who 
argue dialectically&mdash;but only definitions.) (<em>PoA</em>, I, 
12, 78a6-13) 
 {<a href="bib2.html#2.4">&sect;2.4</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>


 <a name="AristotleNE"></a>We
 deliberate not about ends but about means. For a doctor does not 
deliberate whether he shall heal, nor an orator whether he shall 
convince, nor a statesman whether he shall produce law and order, nor
does any one else deliberate about his end. Having set the end, they 
consider how and by what means it is to be attained; and if it seems 
to be produced by several means they consider by which it is most 
easily and best produced, while if it is achieved by one only they 
consider how it will be achieved by this and by what means 
<em>this</em> will be achieved, till they come to the first cause, 
which in the order of discovery is last. For the person who 
deliberates seems to inquire and analyse in the way described as 
though he were analysing a geometrical construction (not all inquiry 
appears to be deliberation&mdash;for instance mathematical 
inquiries&mdash;but all deliberation is inquiry), and what is last in
the order of analysis seems to be first in the order of becoming. And
if we come on an impossibility, we give up the search, e.g. if we 
need money and this cannot be got; but if a thing appears possible we
try to do it. (<em>NE</em>, III, 3, 1112b8-27) 
 {<a href="bib2.html#2.4">&sect;2.4</a>}
 </p></li></ol>

<h4><a name="Arnauld">Arnauld, Antoine and Nicole, Pierre</a></h4>
<ol>
<li><p>

The art of arranging a series of thoughts properly, either for 
discovering the truth when we do not know it, or for proving to 
others what we already know, can generally be called method.</p>
<p>

Hence there are two kinds of method, one for discovering the truth, 
which is known as <em>analysis</em>, or the <em>method of 
resolution</em>, and which can also be called the <em>method of 
discovery</em>. The other is for making the truth understood by 
others once it is found. This is known as <em>synthesis</em>, or the 
<em>method of composition</em>, and can also be called the <em>method
of instruction</em>.</p>
<p>

Analysis does not usually deal with the entire body of a science, but
is used only for resolving some issue. (<em>LAT</em>, 233-4) 
 {<a href="bib4.html#4.1">&sect;4.1</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

Now analysis consists primarily in paying attention to what is known 
in the issue we want to resolve. The entire art is to derive from 
this examination many truths that can lead us to the knowledge we are
seeking.</p>
<p>

Suppose we wondered whether the human soul is immortal, and to 
investigate it we set out to consider the nature of the soul. First 
we would notice that it is distinctive of the soul to think, and that
it could doubt everything without being able to doubt whether it is 
thinking, since doubting is itself a thought. Next we would ask what 
thinking is. Since we would see nothing contained in the idea of 
thought that is contained in the idea of the extended substance 
called body, and since we could even deny of thought everything 
belonging to body - such as having length, width, and depth, having 
different parts, having a certain shape, being divisible, etc. - 
without thereby destroying the idea we have of thought, from this we 
would conclude that thought is not at all a mode of extended 
substance, because it is the nature of a mode not to be able to be 
conceived while the thing of which it is a mode is denied. From this 
we infer, in addition, that since thought is not a mode of extended 
substance, it must be the attribute of another substance. Hence 
thinking substance and extended substance are two really distinct 
substances. It follows from this that the destruction of one in no 
way brings about the destruction of the other, since even extended 
substance is not properly speaking destroyed, but all that happens in
what we call destruction is nothing more than the change or 
dissolution of several parts of matter which exist forever in nature.
Likewise it is quite easy to judge that in breaking all the gears of 
a clock no substance is destroyed, although we say that the clock is 
destroyed. This shows that since the soul is in no way divisible or 
composed of parts, it cannot perish, and consequently is immortal.</p>
<p>

This is what we call <em>analysis</em> or <em>resolution</em>. We 
should notice, first, that in this method - as in the one called 
<em>composition</em> - we should practice proceeding from what is 
better known to what is less known. For there is no true method which
could dispense with this rule.</p>
 
<p>

Second, it nevertheless differs from the method of composition in 
that these known truths are taken from a particular examination of 
the thing we are investigating, and not from more general things as 
is done in the method of instruction. Thus in the example we 
presented, we did not begin by establishing these general maxims: 
that no substance perishes, properly speaking; that what is called 
destruction is only a dissolution of parts; that therefore what has 
no parts cannot be destroyed, etc. Instead we rose by stages to these
general notions.</p>
<p>

Third, in analysis we introduce clear and evident maxims only to the 
extent that we need them, whereas in the other method we establish 
them first, as we will explain below.</p>
<p>

Fourth and finally, these two methods differ only as the route one 
takes in climbing a mountain from a valley differs from the route 
taken in descending from the mountain into the valley, or as the two 
ways differ that are used to prove that a person is descended from 
St. Louis. One way is to show that this person had a certain man for 
a father who was the son of a certain man, and that man was the son 
of another, and so on up to St. Louis. The other way is to begin with
St. Louis and show that he had a certain child, and this child had 
others, thereby descending to the person in question. This example is
all the more appropriate in this case, since it is certain that to 
trace an unknown genealogy, it is necessary to go from the son to the
father, whereas to explain it after finding it, the most common 
method is to begin with the trunk to show the descendants. This is 
also what is usually done in the sciences where, after analysis is 
used to find some truth, the other method is employed to explain what
has been found.</p>
<p>

This is the way to understand the nature of analysis as used by 
geometers. Here is what it consists in. Suppose a question is 
presented to them, such as whether it is true or false that something
is a theorem, or whether a problem is possible or impossible; they 
assume what is at issue and examine what follows from that 
assumption. If in this examination they arrive at some clear truth 
from which the assumption follows necessarily, they conclude that the
assumption is true. Then starting over from the end point, they 
demonstrate it by the other method which is called 
<em>composition</em>. But if they fall into some absurdity or 
impossibility as a necessary consequence of their assumption, they 
conclude from this that the assumption is false and impossible.</p>
<p>

This is what may be said in a general way about analysis, which 
consists more in judgment and mental skill than in particular rules.

<ol>
<li><p>

It is advisable to stress the point that philosophy, as we understand
it, is wholly independent of metaphysics, inasmuch as the analytic 
method is commonly supposed by its critics to have a metaphysical 
basis. Being misled by the associations of the word 
&lsquo;analysis&rsquo;, they assume that philosophical analysis is an
activity of dissection; that it consists in &lsquo;breaking up&rsquo;
objects into their constituent parts, until the whole universe is 
ultimately exhibited as an aggregate of &lsquo;bare 
particulars&rsquo;, united by external relations. If this were really
so, the most effective way of attacking the method would be to show 
that its basic presupposition was nonsensical. For to say that the 
universe was an aggregate of bare particulars would be as senseless 
as to say that it was Fire or Water or Experience. It is plain that 
no such possible observation would enable to veify such an assertion.
But, so far as I know, this line of criticism is in fact never 
adopted. The critics content themselves with pointing out that few, 
if any, of the complex objects in the world are simply the sum of 
their parts. They have a structure, an organic unity, which 
distinguishes them, as genuine wholes, from mere aggregates. But the 
analyst, so it is said, is obliged by his atomistic metaphysics to 
regard an object consisting of parts <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, 
<em>c</em>, and <em>d</em>, in a distinctive configuration as being 
simply <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> + <em>c</em> + <em>d</em>, and thus 
gives an entirely false account of its nature.</p>

<p>

If we follow the Gestalt psychologists, who of all men talk most 
constantly about genuine wholes, in defining such a whole as one in 
which the properties of every part depend to some extent on its 
position in the whole, then we may accept it as an empirical fact 
that there exist genuine, or organic, wholes. And if the analytic 
method involved a denial of this fact, it would indeed be a faulty 
method. But, actually, the validity of the analytic method is not 
dependent on any empirical, much less any metaphysical, 
presupposition about the nature of things. For the philosopher, as an
analyst, is not directly concerned with the physical properties of 
things. He is concerned only with the way in which we speak about 
them.</p>

<p>

In other words, the propositions of philosophy are not factual, but 
linguistic in character &ndash; that is, they do not describe the 
behaviour of physical, or even mental, objects; they express 
definitions, or the formal consequences of definitions. Accordingly, 
we may say that philosophy is a department of logic. For we shall see
that the characteristic mark of a purely logical inquiry is that it 
is concerned with the formal consequences of our definitions and not 
with questions of empirical fact.</p>

<p>

It follows that philosophy does not in any way compete with science. 
The difference in type between philosophical and scientific 
propositions is such that they cannot conceivably contradict one 
another. And this makes it clear that the possibility of 
philosophical analysis is independent of any empirical assumptions. 
That it is independent of any metaphysical assumptions should be even
more obvious still. For it is absurd to suppose that the provision of
definitions, and the study of their formal consequences, involves the
nonsensical assertion that the world is composed of bare particulars,
or any other metaphysical dogma.</p>

<p>

What has contributed as much as anything to the prevalent 
misunderstanding of the nature of philosophical analysis is the fact 
that propositions and questions which are really linguistic are often
expressed in such a way that they appear to be factual. A striking 
instance of this is provided by the proposition that a material thing
cannot be in two places at once. This looks like an empirical 
proposition, and is constantly invoked by those who desire to prove 
that it is possible for an empirical proposition to be logically 
certain. But a more critical inspection shows that it is not 
empirical at all, but linguistic. It simply records the fact that, as
the result of certain verbal conventions, the proposition that two 
sense-contents occur in the same visual or tactual sense-field is 
incompatible with the proposition that they belong to the same 
material thing. And this is indeed a necessary fact. But it has not 
the least tendency to show that we have certain knowledge about the 
empirical properties of objects. For it is necessary only because we 
happen to use the relevant words in a particular way. There is no 
logical reason why we should not so alter our definitions that the 
sentence &lsquo;A thing cannot be in two places at once&rsquo; comes 
to express a self-contradiction instead of a necessary truth. (1936, 
75-7)

 </p></li>


<li><p>

From our assertion that philosophy provides definitions, it must not 
be inferred that it is the function of the philosopher to compile a 
dictionary, in the ordinary sense. For the definitions which 
philosophy is required to provide are of a different kind from those 
which we expect to find in dictionaries. In a dictionary we look 
mainly for what may be called <em>explicit</em> definitions; in 
philosophy, for definitions <em>in use</em>. ...</p>
<p>

We define a symbol <em> in use</em>, not by saying that it is 
synonymous with some other symbol, but by showing how the sentences 
in which it significantly occurs can be translated into equivalent 
sentences, which contain neither the <em>definiendum</em> itself, nor
any of its synonyms. A good illustration of this process is provided 
by Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s so-called theory of descriptions, which 
is not a theory at all in the ordinary sense, but an indication of 
the way in which all phrases of the form &lsquo;the so-and-so&rsquo; 
are to be defined. (<em>Ibid</em>., 80-1) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.7">&sect;6.7</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

[A serious mistake in my account in <em>Language, Truth and 
Logic</em>] was my assumption that philosophical analysis consisted 
mainly in the provision of &lsquo;definitions in use&rsquo;. It is, 
indeed, true that what I describe as philosophical analysis is very 
largely a matter of exhibiting the inter-relationship of different 
types of propositions; but the cases in which this process actually 
yields a set of definitions are the exception rather than the rule. 
...</p>
<p>

... Thus, when Professor Moore suggests that to say that 
&lsquo;existence is not a predicate&rsquo; may be a way of saying 
that &lsquo;there is some very important difference between the way 
in which &ldquo;exist&rdquo; is used in such a sentence as 
&ldquo;Tame tigers exist&rdquo; and the way in which 
&ldquo;growl&rdquo; is used in &ldquo;Tame tigers 
growl&rdquo;&rsquo;, he does not develop his point by giving rules 
for the translation of one set of sentences into another. What he 
does is to remark that whereas it makes good sense to say &lsquo;All 
tame tigers growl&rsquo; or &lsquo;Most tame tigers growl&rsquo; it 
would be nonsense to say &lsquo;All tame tigers exist&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;Most tame tigers exist&rsquo;. Now this may seem a rather 
trivial point for him to make, but in fact it is philosophically 
illuminating. For it is precisely the assumption that existence is a 
predicate that gives plausibility to &lsquo;the ontological 
argument&rsquo;; and the ontological argument is supposed to 
demonstrate the existence of a God. Consequently Moore by pointing 
out a peculiarity in the use of the word &lsquo;exist&rsquo; helps to
protect us from a serious fallacy; so that his procedure, though 
different from that which Russell follows in his theory of 
descriptions, tends to achieve the same philosophical end. (1946, 
31-3)

By intuition is meant the kind of <em>intellectual sympathy</em> by 
which one places oneself within an object in order to coincide with 
what is unique in it and consequently inexpressible. Analysis, on the
contrary, is the operation which reduces the object to elements 
already known, that is, to elements common both to it and other 
objects. To analyse, therefore, is to express a thing as a function 
of something other than itself. All analysis is thus a translation, a
development into symbols, a representation taken from successive 
points of view from which we note as many resemblances as possible 
between the new object which we are studying and others which we 
believe we know already. In its eternally unsatisfied desire to 
embrace the object around which it is compelled to turn, analysis 
multiplies without end the number of its points of view in order to 
complete its always incomplete representation, and ceaselessly varies
its symbols that it may perfect the always imperfect translation. It 
goes on, therefore, to infinity. But intuition, if intuition is 
possible, is a simple act. (1903, 6-7) 
 {<a href="bib5.html#5.1">&sect;5.1</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

[Analysis] operates always on the immobile, whilst intuition places 
itself in mobility, or, what comes to the same thing, in duration. 
There lies the very distinct line of demarcation between intuition 
and analysis. The real, the experienced and the concrete are 
recognised by the fact that they are variability itself, the element 
by the fact that it is invariable. And the element is invariable by 
definition, being a diagram, a simplified reconstruction, often a 
mere symbol, in any case a motionless view of the moving reality.

Modern science is neither one nor simple. It rests, I freely admit, 
on ideas which in the end we find clear; but these ideas have 
gradually become clear through the use made of them; they owe most of
their clearness to the light which the facts, and the applications to
which they led, have by reflection shed on them - the clearness of a 
concept being scarcely anything more at bottom than the certainty, at
last obtained, of manipulating the concept profitably. At its origin,
more than one of these concepts must have appeared obscure, not 
easily reconcilable with the concepts already admitted into science, 
and indeed very near the borderline of absurdity. This means that 
science does not proceed by an orderly dovetailing together of 
concepts predestined to fit each other exactly. True and fruitful 
ideas are so many close contacts with currents of reality, which do 
not necessarily converge on the same point. However the concepts in 
which they lodge themselves manage somehow, by rubbing off each 
other's corners, to settle down well enough together. (1903, 74)

It may help to be reminded that many philosophers who might allow 
themselves to be described as &ldquo;analysts&rdquo; have been 
strongly influenced by the work of Russell, Moore, and Wittgenstein. 
For while all three have been engaged in &ldquo;clarification of 
meaning&rdquo; they have done so in different and distinctive ways; 
and the resulting divergences in conceptions of philosophical method 
have not yet been reconciled. This makes it hard to give any simple 
account of what is meant today by &ldquo;philosophical 
analysis&rdquo;. (1950a, 2) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.1">&sect;6.1</a>}
 </p></li>

<li><p>

A man who had to describe &ldquo;philosophical analysis&rdquo; might 
resort to talking about a climate of opinion. The weather, he might 
say, is congenial to empiricists, naturalists, agnostics; the well 
acclimatized have admired the two <em>Principia&rsquo;s</em> and the 
<em> Tractatus</em> and have read a hundred pages of Hume for one of 
Kant. Here rhetoric is viewed with suspicion and enthusiasm barely 
tolerated; this is a land of &ldquo;prose writers, hoping to be 
understood&rdquo; [J.M. Keynes, <em>A Treatise on Probability</em>, 
1921, preface].</p>

<p>

... If a formula or a slogan is wanted, it is easy enough to say that
these writers (like Russell, Moore, and Wittgenstein before them) are
engaged in <em>clarification of meaning</em>. ... And if those who 
are best at the work of clarification might feel embarrassed to 
provide a satisfactory analysis of &ldquo;analysis&rdquo;, that is 
perhaps no cause for apology or alarm. For it is a mark of life to 
resist arbitrary confinement, and &ldquo;philosohical analysis&rdquo;
is still much alive. (1950a, 12-13)

It is a very common and most ruinous superstition to suppose that 
analysis is no alteration, and that, whenever we distinguish, we have
at once to do with divisible existence. It is an immense assumption 
to conclude, when a fact comes to us as a whole, that some parts of 
it may exist without any sort of regard for the rest. Such naive 
assurance of the outward reality of all mental distinctions, such 
touching confidence in the crudest identity of thought and existence,
is worthy of the school which so loudly appeals to the name of 
Experience. ... If it is true in any sense (and I will not deny it) 
that thought in the end is the measure of things, yet at least this 
is false, that the divisions we make within a whole all answer to 
elements whose existence does <em>not</em> depend on the rest. It is 
wholly unjustifiable to take up a complex, to do any work we please 
upon it by analysis, and then simply predicate as an adjective of the
given these results of our abstraction. These products were never 
there as such, and in saying, as we do, that as such they are there, 
we falsify the fact. You can not always apply in actual experience 
that coarse notion of the whole as the sum of its parts into which 
the school of &lsquo;experience&rsquo; so delights to torture 
phenomena. If it is wrong in physiology to predicate the results, 
that are reached by dissection, simply and as such of the living 
body, it is here infinitely more wrong. The whole that is given to us
is a continuous mass of perception and feeling; and to say of this 
whole, that any one element would be what it is there, when apart 
from the rest, is a very grave assertion. We might have supposed it 
not quite self-evident, and that it was possible to deny it without 
open absurdity. (<em>PL</em>, &sect;64/ <em>WLM</em>, 77-8)

At any moment my actual experience, however relational its contents, 
is in the end non-relational. No analysis into relations and terms 
can ever exhaust its nature or fail in the end to belie its essence. 
What analysis leaves for ever outstanding is no mere residue, but is 
a vital condition of the analysis itself. Everything which is got out
into the form of an object implies still the felt background against 
which the object comes, and, further, the whole experience of both 
feeling and object is a non-relational immediate felt unity. The 
entire relational consciousness, in short, is experienced as falling 
within a direct awareness. This direct awareness is itself 
non-relational. It escapes from all attempts to exhibit it by 
analysis as one or more elements in a relational scheme, or as that 
scheme itself, or as a relation or relations, or as the sum or 
collection of any of these abstractions. And immediate experience not
only escapes, but it serves as the basis on which the analysis is 
made. Itself is the vital element within which every analysis 
still moves, while, and so far as, and however much, that analysis 
transcends immediacy. (<em>ETR</em>, 176/<em>WLM</em>, 280-1)

I think of analytic philosophy as having at its center a concern with
semantic relations between what I will call 
&lsquo;vocabularies&rsquo;. &hellip; Its characteristic form of question 
is whether and in what way one can make sense of the meanings 
expressed by one kind of locution interms of the meanings expressed 
by another kind of locution. So, for instance, two early paradigmatic
projects were to show that everything expressible in the vocabulary 
of number-theory, and again, everything expressible using definite 
descriptions, is expressible already in the vocabulary of first-order
quantificational logic with identity.</p>
<p>

The nature of the key kind of semantic relation between vocabularies 
has been variously characterized during the history of analytic 
philosophy: as analysis, definition, paraphrase, translation, 
reduction of different sorts, truth-making, and various kinds of 
supervenience&mdash;to name just a few contenders. In each case, 
however, it is characteristic of classical analytic philosophy that 
<em>logical</em> vocabulary is accorded a privileged role in 
specifying these semantic relations. It has always been taken at 
least to be <em>licit</em> to appeal to logical vocabulary in 
elaborating the relation between <em>analysandum</em> and 
<em>analysans</em>&mdash;target vocabulary and base 
vocabulary&mdash;and, according to stronger versions of this thesis, 
that may be the <em>only</em> vocabulary it is licit to employ in 
that capacity. I will refer to this aspect of the analytic project as
its commitment to &lsquo;<em>semantic logicism</em>&rsquo;. (2006,

<li><p>

What I want to call the &ldquo;classical project of analysis&rdquo;, 
then, aims to exhibit the meanings expressed by various target 
vocabularies as intelligible by means of the logical elaboration of 
the meanings expressed by base vocabularies thought to be privileged 
in some important respects&mdash;epistemological, ontological, or 
semantic&mdash;relative to those others. This enterprise is visible 
in its purest form in what I have called the &ldquo;core 
programs&rdquo; of empiricism and naturalism, in their various forms.
In my view the most significant conceptual development in this 
tradition&mdash;the biggest thing that ever happened to it&mdash;is 
the <em>pragmatist challenge</em> to it that was mounted during the 
middle years of the twentieth century. Generically, this movement of 
thought amounts to a displacement from the center of philosophical 
attention of the notion of <em>meaning</em> in favor of that of 
<em>use</em>: in suitably broad senses of those terms, replacing 
concern with <em>semantics</em> by concern with <em>pragmatics</em>.

explicating, or of giving an <em>explication</em> for, the earlier 
concept &hellip; (1947, 8-9) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.7">&sect;6.7</a>}
 </p></li>

<li><p>


 <a name="Carnap1950"></a>By
 the procedure of <em>explication</em> we mean the transformation of 
an inexact, prescientific concept, the <em>explicandum</em>, into a 
new exact concept, the <em>explicatum</em>. Although the explicandum 
cannot be given in exact terms, it should be made as clear as 
possible by informal explanations and examples. ...</p>

<p>

The term &lsquo;explicatum&rsquo; has been suggested by the following
two usages. Kant calls a judgement explicative if the predicate is 
obtained by analysis of the subject. Husserl, in speaking about the 
synthesis of identification between a confused, nonarticulated sense 
and a subsequently intended distinct, articulated sense, calls the 
latter the &lsquo;Explikat&rsquo; of the former. (For both uses see 
<em>Dictionary of philosophy</em> [1942], ed. D. Runes, p. 105). What
I mean by &lsquo;explicandum&rsquo; and &lsquo;explicatum&rsquo; is 
to some extent similar to what C.H. Langford calls 
&lsquo;analysandum&rsquo; and &lsquo;analysans&rsquo;: &ldquo;the 
analysis then states an appropriate relation of equivalence between 
the analysandum and the analysans&rdquo; [Langford 1942, 323 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.4">&sect;6.4</a>}];
 he says that the motive of an analysis &ldquo;is usually that of 
supplanting a relatively vague idea by a more precise one&rdquo; 
(<em>ibid</em>., p. 329).</p>

<p>

(Perhaps the form &lsquo;explicans&rsquo; might be considered instead
of &lsquo;explicatum&rsquo;; however, I think that the analogy with 
the terms &lsquo;definiendum&rsquo; and &lsquo;definiens&rsquo; would
not be useful because, if the explication consists in giving an 
explicit definition, then both the definiens and the definiendum in 
this definition express the explicatum, while the explicandum does 
not occur.) The procedure of explication is here understood in a 
wider sense than the procedures of analysis and clarification which 
Kant, Husserl, and Langford have in mind. The explicatum (in my 
sense) is in many cases the result of analysis of the explicandum 
(and this has motivated my choice of the terms); in other cases, 
however, it deviates deliberately from the explicandum but still 
takes its place in some way; this will become clear by the subsequent
examples. (1950, 3)

[T]he sense of all objective judgments reduces to a final original 
relation, which can be expressed in different formulations as the 
relation of &ldquo;form&rdquo; to &ldquo;content&rdquo;, as the 
relation of &ldquo;universal&rdquo; to &ldquo;particular&rdquo;, as 
the relation of &ldquo;validity [<em>Geltung</em>]&rdquo; to 
&ldquo;being [<em>Sein</em>]&rdquo;. Whatever designation one may 
finally choose here, what is alone decisive is that the basic 
relation itself is to be retained as a strictly <em>unitary</em> 
relation, which can only be designated through the two opposed 
moments that enter into it &ndash; but never constructed out of them,
as if they were independent constituents present in themselves. The 
original relation is not to be defined in such a way that the 
&ldquo;universal&rdquo; somehow &ldquo;subsists&rdquo; next to or 
above the &ldquo;particular&rdquo; &ndash; the form somehow separate 
from the content &ndash; so that the two are then melded with one 
another by means of some or another fundamental synthesis of 
knowledge. Rather, the unity of mutual <em>determination</em> 
constitutes the absolutely first datum, behind which one can go back 
no further, and which can only be analyzed via the duality of two 
&ldquo;viewpoints&rdquo; in an artificially isolating process of 
abstraction. It is the basic flaw of all metaphysical epistemologies 
that they always attempt to reinterpret this duality of 
&ldquo;moments&rdquo; as a duality of &ldquo;elements&rdquo;. (1913,

When philosophical analysis proceeds from intuitively sanctioned

from analysandum to analysans. It seeks to ensure that any muddles or

are replaced by an explicitly formulated, consciously co-ordinated,

Socrates was essentially the inventor of a method. ... His revolt 
against the study of nature was essentially a revolt against 
observation in favour of thought; and whereas mathematical method, as
an example of thought, had already been discovered by his 
predecessors, his own discovery was that a similar method, for which 
he invented an appropriate technique, could be applied to ethical 
questions. This technique, as he himself recognized, depended on a 
principle which is of great importance to any theory of philosophical
method: the principle that in a philosophical inquiry what we are 
trying to do is not to discover something of which until now we have 
been ignorant, but to know better something which in some sense we 
knew already; not to know it better in the sense of coming to know 
more about it, but to know it better in the sense of coming to know 
it in a different and better way&mdash;actually instead of 
potentially, or explicitly instead of implicitly, or in whatever 
terms the theory of knowledge chooses to express the difference: the 
difference itself has been a familiar fact ever since Socrates 
pointed it out. (1933, 10-11)

[The] work of disentangling and arranging questions, which ... I 
[call] analysis, may be alternatively described as the work of 
detecting presuppositions. ... The analysis which detects absolute 
presuppositions I call metaphysical analysis; but as regards 
procedure and the qualifications necessary to carry it out there is 
no difference whatever between metaphysical analysis and analysis 
pure and simple ... (1940, 39-40)

 </p></li>


<li><p>

It is only by analysis that any one can ever come to know either that
he is making any absolute presuppositions at all or what absolute 
presuppositions he is making.</p>
<p>

Such analysis may in certain cases proceed in the following manner. 
If the inquirer can find a person to experiment upon who is well 
trained in a certain type of scientific work, intelligent and earnest
in his devotion to it, and unaccustomed to metaphysics, let him probe
into various presuppositions that his &lsquo;subject&rsquo; has been 
taught to make in the course of his scientific education, and invite 
him to justify each or alternatively to abandon it. If the 
&lsquo;inquirer&rsquo; is skilful and the &lsquo;subject&rsquo; the 
right kind of man, these invitations will be contemplated with 
equanimity, and even with interest, so long as relative 
presuppositions are concerned. But when an absolute presupposition is
touched, the invitation wil be rejected, even with a certain degree 
of violence.</p>
<p>

The rejection is a symptom that the &lsquo;subject&rsquo;, 
co-operating with the work of analysis, has come to see that the 
presupposition he is being asked to justify or abandon is an absolute
presupposition; and the violence with which it is expressed is a 
symptom that he feels the importance of this absolute presupposition 
for the kind of work to which he is devoted. This is what ... I 
called being &lsquo;ticklish in one&rsquo;s absolute 
presuppositions&rsquo;; and the reader will see that this 
ticklishness is a sign of intellectual health combined with a low 
degree of analytical skill. A man who is ticklish in that way is a 
man who knows, &lsquo;instinctively&rsquo; as they say, that absolute
presuppositions do not need justification. (<em>Ibid.</em>, 43-4)

In philosophy we are used to definitions, analyses,

better understood, or clear, or more basic epistemologically or

suggested fits none of these categories.  I have proposed a looser
relation between concepts to be illuminated and the relatively more
basic. (&lsquo;Radical Interpretation&rsquo;, 1972, <em>Inquiries into

Unlike the primitives who gave a face to every moving thing, or the 
early Greeks who defined all the aspects and forces of nature, modern
man is obsessed by the need to depersonalise (or impersonalise) all 
that he most admires. There are two reasons for this tendency. The 
first is <em>analysis</em>, that marvellous instrument of scientific 
research to which we owe all our advances but which, breaking down 
synthesis after synthesis, allows one soul after another to escape, 
leaving us confronted with a pile of dismantled machinery, and 
evanescent particles. The second reason lies in the discovery of the 
sidereal world, so vast that it seems to do away with all proportion 
between our own being and the dimensions of the cosmos around us.

Up until now the idea of philosophy remained defined in a formal way
as an idea of an infinite task <em>theoria</em>. Could a history of
this infinite theoretical life, which merges itself in its efforts and
failures with a simple <em>realization of the self</em>, take on the
value of a genetic description? Will the history of the
&ldquo;transcendental motive&rdquo; through all the stages of European
philosophy, enlighten us at last on the genesis of transcendental
subjectivity? But such a history presupposes the possibility of such a
going backward, the possibility of finding again the originary sense
of the former presents as such. It implies the possibility of a
transcendental &ldquo;regression&rdquo; (<em>Ruckfrage</em>) through a
history that is intelligible and transparent to consciousness, a
history whose sedimentations can be unmade and remade without
alteration. (<em>The Problem of Genesis in Husserl's Philosophy</em>,

[discussing his &lsquo;Rule Four&rsquo;: &ldquo;<em>We need a method

the human mind has within it a sort of spark of the divine, in which 
the first seeds of useful ways of thinking are sown, seeds which, 
however neglected and stifled by studies which impede them, often 
bear fruit of their own accord. This is our experience in the 
simplest of sciences, arithmetic and geometry: we are well aware that
the geometers of antiquity employed a sort of analysis which they 
went on to apply to the solution of every problem, though they 
begrudged revealing it to posterity. At the present time a sort of 
arithmetic called &lsquo;algebra&rsquo; is flourishing, and this is 
achieving for numbers what the ancients did for figures. (<em>Rules

<li><p>

As for the method of demonstration, this divides into two varieties: 
the first proceeds by analysis and the second by synthesis.</p>
<p>

Analysis shows the true way by means of which the thing in question 
was discovered methodically and as it were <em>a priori</em>, so that
if the reader is willing to follow it and give sufficient attention 
to all points, he will make the thing his own and understand it just 
as perfectly as if he had discovered it for himself. But this method 
contains nothing to compel belief in an argumentative or inattentive 
reader; for if he fails to attend even to the smallest point, he will
not see the necessity of the conclusion. Moreover there are many 
truths which - although it is vital to be aware of them - this method
often scarcely mentions, since they are transparently clear to anyone
who gives them his attention.</p>
<p>

Synthesis, by contrast, employs a directly opposite method where the 
search is, as it were, <em>a posteriori</em> (though the proof itself
is often more <em>a priori</em> than it is in the analytic method). 
It demonstrates the conclusion clearly and employs a long series of 
definitions, postulates, axioms, theorems and problems, so that if 
anyone denies one of the conclusions it can be shown at once that it 
is contained in what has gone before, and hence the reader, however 
argumentative or stubborn he may be, is compelled to give his assent.
However, this method is not as satisfying as the method of analysis, 
nor does it engage the minds of those who are eager to learn, since 
it does not show how the thing in question was discovered.</p>
<p>

It was synthesis alone that the ancient geometers usually employed in
their writings. But in my view this was not because they were utterly
ignorant of analysis, but because they had such a high regard for it 
that they kept it to themselves like a sacred mystery.</p>
<p>

Now it is analysis which is the best and truest method of 
instruction, and it was this method alone which I employed in my 
<em>Meditations</em>. As for synthesis, which is undoubtedly what you
are asking me to use here, it is a method which it may be very 
suitable to deploy in geometry as a follow-up to analysis, but it 
cannot so conveniently be applied to these metaphysical subjects.</p>
<p>

The difference is that the primary notions which are presupposed for 
the demonstration of geometrical truths are readily accepted by 
anyone, since they accord with the use of our senses. Hence there is 
no difficulty there, except in the proper deduction of the 
consequences, which can be done even by the less attentive, provided 
they remember what has gone before. Moreover, the breaking down of 
propositions to their smallest elements is specifically designed to 
enable them to be recited with ease so that the student recalls them 
whether he wants to or not.</p>
<p>

In metaphysics by contrast there is nothing which causes so much 
effort as making our perception of the primary notions clear and 
distinct. Admittedly, they are by their nature as evident as, or even
more evident than, the primary notions which the geometers study; but
they conflict with many preconceived opinions derived from the senses
which we have got into the habit of holding from our earliest years, 
and so only those who really concentrate and meditate and withdraw 
their minds from corporeal things, so far as is possible, will 
achieve perfect knowledge of them. Indeed, if they were put forward 
in isolation, they could easily be denied by those who like to 
contradict just for the sake of it. (&lsquo;Second Set of

 <a name="FregeRH"></a>[In
 replying to the objections that Husserl had raised in his 
<em>Philosophie der Arithmetik</em> (1891) to Frege&rsquo;s 
<em>Grundlagen</em> definitions] If words and combinations of words 
refer to [<em>bedeuten</em>] ideas, then for any two of them there 
are only two possibilities: either they designate the same idea or 
they designate different ideas. In the former case it is pointless to
equate them by means of a definition: this is &lsquo;an obvious 
circle&rsquo;; in the latter case it is wrong. These are also the 
objections the author raises, one of them regularly. A definition is 
also incapable of analysing the sense, for the analysed sense just is
not the original one. In using the word to be explained, I either 
think clearly everything I think when I use the defining expression: 
we then have the &lsquo;obvious circle&rsquo;; or the defining 
expression has a more richly articulated sense, in which case I do 
not think the same thing in using it as I do in using the word to be 
explained: the definition is then wrong. One would think that a 
definition was unobjectionable in the case where the word to be 
explained had as yet no sense at all, or where we were asked 
explicitly to regard its sense as non-existent so that it was first 
given a sense by the definition. But in the last case too, the author
refutes the definition by reminding us of the difference between the 
ideas (p. 107). To evade all objections, one would accordingly have 
to create a new verbal root and form a word out of it. This reveals a
split between psychological logicians and mathematicians. What 
matters to the former is the sense of the words, as well as the ideas
which they fail to distinguish from the sense; whereas what matters 
to the latter is the thing itself: the <em>Bedeutung</em> of the 
words. The reproach that what is defined is not the concept but its 
extension actually affects all mathematical definitions. For the 
mathematician, it is no more right and no more wrong to define a 
conic as the line of intersection of a plane with the surface of a 
circular cone than to define it as a plane curve with an equation of 
the second degree in parallel coordinates. His choice of one or the 
other of these expressions or of some other one is guided solely by 
reasons of convenience and is made irrespective of the fact that the 
expressions have neither the same sense nor evoke the same ideas. I 
do not intend by this that a concept and its extension are one and 
the same, but that coincidence in extension is a necessary and 
sufficient criterion for the occurrence between concepts of the 
relation that corresponds to identity [<em>Gleichheit</em>] between 
objects. (<em>RH</em>, 319-20/<em>FR</em>, 225-6)

 <a name="FregeLM"></a>We
 come to <em>definitions</em>. Definitions proper must be 
distinguished from <em>elucidations</em> 
[<em>Erl&auml;uterungen</em>]. In the first stages of any discipline 
we cannot avoid the use of ordinary words. But these words are, for 
the most part, not really appropriate for scientific purposes, 
because they are not precise enough and fluctuate in their use. 
Science needs technical terms that have precise and fixed 
<em>Bedeutungen</em>, and in order to come to an understanding about 
these <em>Bedeutungen</em> and exclude possible misunderstandings, we
provide elucidations. Of course in so doing we have again to use 
ordinary words, and these may display defects similar to those which 
the elucidations are intended to remove. So it seems that we shall 
then have to provide further elucidations. Theoretically one will 
never really achieve one&rsquo;s goal in this way. In practice, 
however, we do manage to come to an understanding about the 
<em>Bedeutungen</em> of words. Of course we have to be able to count 
on a meeting of minds, on others&rsquo; guessing what we have in 
mind. But all this precedes the construction of a system and does not
belong within a system. In constructing a system it must be assumed 
that the words have precise <em>Bedeutungen</em> and that we know 
what they are. (<em>LM</em>, 224/<em>FR</em>, 313)

<li><p>

We have ... to distinguish <em>two quite different cases</em>:</p>
<p>

1. We construct a sense out of its constituents and introduce an 
entirely new sign to express this sense. This may be called a 
&lsquo;constructive definition&rsquo; [&lsquo;<em>aufbauende 
Definition</em>&rsquo;], but we prefer to call it a 
&lsquo;definition&rsquo; <em>tout court</em>.</p>
<p>

2. We have a simple sign with a long-established use. We believe that
we can give a logical analysis [<em>Zerlegung</em>] of its sense, 
obtaining a complex expression which in our opinion has the same 
sense. We can only allow something as a constituent of a complex 
expression if it has a sense we recognize. The sense of the complex 
expression must be yielded by the way in which it is put together. 
That it agrees with the sense of the long established simple sign is 
not a matter for arbitrary stipluation, but can only be recognized by
an immediate insight. No doubt we speak of a definition in this case 
too. It might be called an &lsquo;analytic definition&rsquo; 
[&lsquo;<em>zerlegende Definition</em>&rsquo;] to distinguish it from
the first case. But it is better to eschew the word 
&lsquo;definition&rsquo; altogether in this case, because what we 
should here like to call a definition is really to be regarded as an 
axiom. In this second case there remains no room for an arbitrary 
stipulation, because the simple sign already has a sense. Only a sign
which as yet has no sense can have a sense arbitrarily assigned to 
it. So we shall stick to our original way of speaking and call only a
constructive definition a definition. According to that a definition 
is an arbitrary stipulation which confers a sense on a simple sign 
which previously had none. This sense has, of course, to be expressed
by a complex sign whose sense results from the way it is put 
together.</p>
<p>

Now we still have to consider the difficulty we come up against in 
giving a logical analysis when it is problematic whether this 
analysis is correct.</p>
<p>

Let us assume that <em>A</em> is the long-established sign 
(expression) whose sense we have attempted to analyse logically by 
constructing a complex expression that gives the analysis. Since we 
are not certain whether the analysis is successful, we are not 
prepared to present the complex expression as one which can be 
replaced by the simple sign <em>A</em>. If it is our intention to put
forward a definition proper, we are not entitled to choose the sign 
<em>A</em>, which already has a sense, but we must choose a fresh 
sign <em>B</em>, say, which has the sense of the complex expression 
only in virtue of the definition. The question now is whether 
<em>A</em> and <em>B</em> have the same sense. But we can bypass this
question altogether if we are constructing a new system from the 
bottom up; in that case we shall make no further use of the sign 
<em>A</em> &ndash; we shall only use <em>B</em>. We have introduced 
the sign <em>B</em> to take the place of the complex expression in 
question by arbitrary fiat and in this way we have conferred a sense 
on it. This is a definition in the proper sense, namely a 
constructive definition.</p>
<p>

If we have managed in this way to construct a system for mathematics 
without any need for the sign <em>A</em>, we can leave the matter 
there; there is no need at all to answer the question concerning the 
sense in which &ndash; whatever it may be &ndash; this sign had been 
used earlier. In this way we court no objections. However, it may be 
felt expedient to use sign <em>A</em> instead of sign <em>B</em>. But
if we do this, we must treat it as an entirely new sign which had no 
sense prior to the definition. We must therefore explain that the 
sense in which this sign was used before the new system was 
constructed is no longer of any concern to us, that its sense is to 
be understood purely from the constructive definition that we have 
given. In constructing the new system we can take no account, 
logically speaking, of anything in mathematics that existed prior to 
the new system. Everything has to be made anew from the ground up. 
Even anything that we may have accomplished by our analytical 
activities is to be regarded only as preparatory work which does not 
itself make any appearance in the new system itself.</p>
<p>

Perhaps there still remains a certain unclarity. How is it possible, 
one may ask, that it should be doubtful whether a simple sign has the
same sense as a complex expression if we know not only the sense of 
the simple sign, but can recognize the sense of the complex one from 
the way it is put together? The fact is that if we really do have a 
clear grasp of the sense of the simple sign, then it cannot be 
doubtful whether it agrees with the sense of the complex expression. 
If this is open to question although we can clearly recognize the 
sense of the complex expression from the way it is put together, then
the reason must lie in the fact that we do not have a clear grasp of 
the sense of the simple sign, but that its outlines are confused as 
if we saw it through a mist. The effect of the logical analysis of 
which we spoke will then be precisely this &ndash; to articulate the 
sense clearly. Work of this kind is very useful; it does not, 
however, form part of the construction of the system, but must take 
place beforehand. Before the work of construction is begun, the 
building stones have to be carefully prepared so as to be usable; 
i.e. the words, signs, expressions, which are to be used, must have a
clear sense, so far as a sense is not to be conferred on them in the 
system itself by means of a constructive definition.</p>
<p>

We stick then to our original conception: <em>a definition is an 
arbitrary stipulation</em> by which a new sign is introduced to take 
the place of a complex expression whose sense we know from the way it
is put together. A sign which hitherto had no sense acquires the 
sense of a complex expression by definition. (<em>LM</em>,

The <em>analysis</em> of an idea, as it used to be carried out, was, 
in fact, nothing else than ridding it of the form in which it had 
become familiar. To break an idea up into its original elements is to
return to its moments, which at least do not have the form of the 
given idea, but rather constitute the immediate property of the self.
This analysis, to be sure, only arrives at <em>thoughts</em> which 
are themselves familiar, fixed, and inert determinations. But what is
thus <em>separated</em> and non-actual is an essential moment; for it
is only because the concrete does divide itself, and make itself into
something non-actual, that it is self-moving. The activity of 
dissolution is the power and work of the <em>Understanding</em>, the 
most astonishing and mightiest of powers, or rather the absolute 
power. The circle that remains self-enclosed and, like substance, 
holds its moments together, is an immediate relationship, one 
therefore which has nothing astonishing about it. But that an 
accident as such, detached from what circumscribes it, what is bound 
and is actual only in its context with others, should attain an 
existence of its own and a separate freedom&mdash;this is the 
tremendous power of the negative; it is the energy of thought, of the
pure &lsquo;I&rsquo;. Death, if that is what we want to call this 
non-actuality, is of all things the most dreadful, and to hold fast 
what is dead requires the greatest strength. Lacking strength, Beauty
hates the Understanding for asking of her what it cannot do. But the 
life of Spirit is not the life that shrinks from death and keeps 
itself untouched by devastation, but rather the life that endures it 
and maintains itself in it. It wins its truth only when, in utter 
dismemberment, it finds itself. It is this power, not as something 
positive, which closes its eyes to the negative, as when we say of 
something that it is nothing or is false, and then, having done with 
it, turn away and pass on to something else; on the contrary, Spirit 
is this power only by looking the negative in the face, and tarrying 
with it. This tarrying with the negative is the magical power that 
converts it into being. This power is identical with what we earlier 
called the Subject, which by giving determinateness an existence in 
its own element supersedes abstract immediacy, i.e. the immediacy 
which barely is, and thus is authentic substance: that being or 
immediacy whose mediation is not outside of it but which is this 
mediation itself. (<em>PS</em>, &lsquo;Preface&rsquo;, &sect;32, 
18-19)</p>

<p>

[Summary of above passage offered by J.N. Findlay] The analysis of an
idea is the removal of its familiarity, its reduction to elements 
that are the true possessions of the thinking self. In such reduction
the idea itself changes and renders itself unreal. The force which 
effects analysis is that of the Understanding, the most remarkable 
and absolute of powers, the power of the thinking self and also of 
death. It is above all marvellous that this thinking self should be 
able to isolate, and to look at apart, what can only exist as an 
aspect or &lsquo;moment&rsquo; in a living whole. Thinking Spirit 
can, however, only grasp such a whole by first tearing it into parts,
each of which it must look at separately for a while, before putting 
them back in the whole. The thinking self must destroy an immediate, 
existent unity in order to arrive at a unity which includes 
mediation, and is in fact mediation itself. (&lsquo;Analysis of the

What we are trying to bring to light here by means of 
phenomenological analysis in regard to the intentional structure of 
production is not contrived and fabricated but already present in the

<em>What philosophers seek to know.</em> Philosophers seek scientific
knowledge either simply or indefinitely, that is, they seek to knkow 
as much as they can when no definite question is proposed or the 
cause of some definite phenomenon or at least to discover something 
definite, such as what the cause of light is, or of heat, or gravity,
of a figure which has been proposed, and similar things; or in what 
subject some proposed accident inheres; or which of many accidents is
above all conducive to the production of some proposed effect; or in 
what way particular proposed causes ought to be conjoined in order to
produce a definite effect. Because of the variety of the things 
sought for, sometimes the analytic method, sometimes the synthetic 
method, and sometimes both ought to be applied.</p>
<p>

<em>The first part, by which principles are found, is purely 
analytic.</em> Seeing that the causes of all singulars are composed 
from the causes of universals or simples, it is necessary for those 
who are looking simply for scientific knowledge, which consists of 
the knowledge of the causes of all things insofar as this can be 
achieved, to know the causes of universals or those accidents which 
are common to all bodies, that is, to every material thing, before 
they know the causes of singular things, that is, of the accidents by
which one thing is distinguished from another. Again, before the 
causes of those things can be known, it is necessary to know which 
things are universals. But since universals are contained in the 
nature of singular things, they must be unearthed by reason, that is,
by resolution. For example, let any conception or idea of a singular 
thing be proposed, say a square. The square is resolved into: 
<em>plane, bounded by a certain number of lines equal to one another,
and right angles</em>. Therefore we have these universals or 
components of every material thing: <em>line, plane</em> (in which a 
surface is contained), <em> being bounded, angle, rectitude</em>, and
<em>equality</em>. If anyone finds the causes or origin of these, he 
will put them together as the cause of the square. Again, if he 
proposes to himself the conception of gold, the ideas of being solid,
visible, and heavy (that is, of tending to the center of the earth or
of motion downwards) and many others more universal than gold itself,
which can be resolved further until one arrives at the most 
universal, will come from this by resolution. And by this same method
of resolving things into other things one will know what those things
are, of which, when their causes are known what those things are, of 
which, when their causes are known and composed one by one, the 
causes of all singular things are known. We thus conclude that the 
method of investigating the universal notions of things is purely 
analytic. (<em>Ibid</em>., &sect;&sect; 3-4, 291-5)

The terms &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; and &ldquo;synthesis&rdquo; bring to
mind, on the one hand, certain methodological practices in the works 
of Plato, Descartes, Newton, Kant, Hegel, and others and, on the 
other hand, techniques in fields as disparate as chemistry and logic,
mathematics and psychology. The width of this spectrum of 
associations alerts us to the realization that at the base of these 
two related terms there lies a specific methodological 
thema-antithema ... pair. Indeed, it is one of the most pervasive and
fundamental ones, in science and outside. This chapter attempts to 
uncover and identify this thematic content, to clarify the meanings 
and uses of the terms &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;synthesis&rdquo;, and especially to distinguish among four 
general meanings: (1) Analysis and Synthesis, and particularly 
synthesis, used in the grand, <em>cultural</em> sense, (2) Analysis 
and Synthesis used in the <em>reconstitutional</em> sense (e.g., 
where an analysis, followed by a synthesis, re-establishes the 
original condition), (3) Analysis and Synthesis used in the 
<em>transformational</em> sense (e.g., where the application of 
Analysis and Synthesis advances one to a qualitatively new level), 
and (4) Analysis and Synthesis used in the <em>judgmental</em> sense 
(as in the Kantian categories and their modern critiques). (1998,

somehow enter into its service as component parts or preliminary

<em>Explication is penetration of the internal horizon of the object 
by the direction of perceptual interest.</em> In the case of the 
unobstructed realization of this interest, the protentional 
expectations fulfill themselves in the same way; the object reveals 
itself in its properties as that which it was anticipated to be, 
except that what was anticipated now attains original givenness. A 
more precise determination results, eventually perhaps partial 
corrections, or&mdash;in the case of obstruction&mdash;disappointment
of the expectations, and partial modalization. (<em>EJ</em>,

&ldquo;object as substrate&rdquo; and &ldquo;determination &alpha;

&sect;1. MATHEMATICS ARRIVES AT ALL ITS DEFINITIONS SYNTHETICALLY, 
WHEREAS PHILOSOPHY ARRIVES AT ITS DEFINITIONS ANALYTICALLY</p>
<p>

There are two ways in which one can arrive at a general concept: 
either by the <em>arbitrary combination</em> of concepts, or by 
<em>separating out</em> that cognition which has been rendered 
distinct by means of analysis. Mathematics only ever draws up its 
definitions in the first way. For example, think arbitrarily of four 
straight lines bounding a plane surface so that the opposite sides 
are not parallel to each other. Let this figure be called a 
<em>trapezium</em>. The concept which I am defining is not given 
prior to the definition itself; on the contrary, it only comes into 
existence as a result of that definition. Whatever the concept of a 
cone may ordinarily signify, in mathematics, the concept is the 
product of the arbitrary representation of a right-angled triangle 
which is rotated on one of its sides. In this and in all other cases 
the definition obviously comes into being as a result of 
<em>synthesis</em>.</p>
<p>

The situation is entirely different in the case of philosophical 
definitions. In philosophy, the concept of a thing is always given, 
albeit confusedly or in an insufficiently determinate fashion. The 
concept has to be analysed; the characteristic marks which have been 
separated out and the concept which has been given have to be 
compared with each other in all kinds of contexts; and this abstract 
thought must be rendered complete and determinate. For example, 
everyone has a concept of time. But suppose that that concept has to 
be defined. The idea of time has to be examined in all kinds of 
relation if its characteristic marks which have been abstracted have 
to be combined together to see whether they yield an adequate 
concept; they have to be collated with each other to see whether one 
characteristic mark does not partly include another within itself. 
If, in this case, I had tried to arrive at a definition of time 
synthetically, it would have had to have been a happy coincidence 
indeed if the concept, thus reached synthetically, had been exactly 
the same as that which completely expresses the idea of time which is
given to us. (<em>IDP</em>, 2:276-7/<em>TP</em>, 248-9)

 </p></li>


<li><p>

The true method of metaphysics is basically the same as that 
introduced by <em>Newton</em> into natural science and which has been
of such benefit to it. <em>Newton&rsquo;s</em> method maintains that 
one ought, on the basis of certain experience and, if need be, with 
the help of geometry, to seek out the rules in accordance with which 
certain phenomena of nature occur. (<em>IDP</em>, 2:286/<em>TP</em>, 
259) 
 {<a href="bib4.html#4.5">&sect;4.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

What I am chiefly concerned to establish is this: in metaphysics one 
must proceed analytically throughout, for the business of metaphysics
is actually the analysis of confused cognitions. If this procedure is
compared with the procedure which is adopted by philosophers and 
which is currently in vogue in all schools of philosophy, one will be
struck by how mistaken the practice of philosophers is. With them, 
the most abstracted concepts, at which the understanding naturally 
arrives last of all, constitute their starting point, and the reason 
is that the method of the mathematicians, which they wish to imitate 
throughout, is firmly fixed in their minds. This is why there is a 
strange difference to be found between metaphysics and all other 
sciences. In geometry and in the other branches of mathematics, one 
starts with what is easier and then one slowly advances to the more 
difficult operations. In metaphysics, one starts with what is the 
most difficult: one starts with possibility, with existence in 
general, with necessity and contingency, and so on &ndash; all of 
them concepts which demand great abstraction and close attention. And
the reason for this is to be sought chiefly in the fact that the 
signs for these concepts undergo numerous and imperceptible 
modifications in use; and the differences between them must not be 
overlooked. One is told that one ought to proceed synthetically 
throughout. Definitions are thus set up right at the beginning, and 
conclusions are confidently drawn from them. Those who practise 
philosophy in this vein congratulate each other for having learnt the
secret of thorough thought from the geometers. What they do not 
notice at all is the fact that geometers acquire their concepts by 
means of <em>synthesis</em>, whereas philosophers can only acquire 
their concepts by means of <em>analysis</em> &ndash; and that 
completely changes the method of thought. ...</p>

<p>

Metaphysics has a long way to go yet before it can proceed 
synthetically. It will only be when analysis has helped us towards 
concepts which are understood distinctly and in detail that it will 
be possible for synthesis to subsume compound cognitions under the 
simplest cognition, as happens in mathematics. (<em>IDP</em>,

Such a system of pure (speculative) reason I hope myself to deliver 
under the title <b>Metaphysics of Nature</b>, which will be not half 
so extensive but will be incomparably richer in content than this 
critique, which had first to display the sources and conditions of 
its possibility, and needed to clear and level a ground that was 
completely overgrown. Here I expect from my reader the patience and 
impartiality of a <b>judge</b>, but there I will expect the 
cooperative spirit and assistance of a <b>fellow worker</b>; for 
however completely the <b>principles</b> of the system may be 
expounded in the critique, the comprehensiveness of the system itself
requires also that no <b>derivative</b> concepts should be lacking, 
which, however, cannot be estimated <em>a priori</em> in one leap, 
but must be gradually sought out; likewise, just as in the former the
whole <b>synthesis</b> of concepts has been exhausted, so in the 
latter it would be additionally demanded that the same thing should 
take place in respect of their <b>analysis</b>, which would be easy 
and more entertainment than labor. (<em>CPR</em>, Axxi)

<li><p>

I understand by an analytic of concepts not their analysis, or the 
usual procedure of philosophical investigations, that of analyzing 
[<em>zergliedern</em>] the content of concepts that present 
themselves and bringing them to distinctness, but rather the much 
less frequently attempted <b>analysis [<em>Zergliederung</em>] of the
faculty of understanding</b> itself, in order to research the 
possibility of <em>a priori</em> concepts by seeking them only in the
understanding as their birthplace and analyzing its pure use in 
general; for this is the proper business of a transcendental 
philosophy; the rest is the logical treatment of concepts in 
philosophy in general. We will therefore pursue the pure concepts 
into their first seeds and predispositions in the human 
understanding, where they lie ready, until with the opportunity of 
experience they are finally developed and exhibited in their clarity 
by the very same understanding, liberated from the empirical 
conditions attaching to them. (<em>CPR</em>, A65-6/B90-1)

[in offering a refutation of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s proof of the 
persistence of the soul] If we take the above propositions in a 
<b>synthetic</b> connection, as valid for all thinking beings, as 
they must be taken in rational psychology as a system, and if from 
the category of relation, starting with the proposition &ldquo;All 
thinking beings are, as such, substances&rdquo; we go backward 
through the series of propositions until the circle closes, then we 
finally come up against the existence of thinking beings, which in 
this system are conscious of themselves not only as independent of 
external things but also as being able to determine themselves from 
themselves (in regard to the persistence belonging necessarily to the
character of a substance). But from this it follows that 
<b>idealism</b>, at least problematic idealism, is unavoidable in 
that same rationalistic system, and if the existence of external 
things is not at all required for the determination of one&rsquo;s 
own existence in time, then such things are only assumed, entirely 
gratuitously, without a proof of them being able to be given.</p>
<p>

If, on the contrary, we follow the <b>analytic</b> procedure, 
grounded on the &ldquo;I think&rdquo; given as a proposition that 
already includes existence in itself, and hence grounded on modality,
and then we take it apart so as to cognize its content, whether and 
how this I determines its existence in space or time merely through 
it, then the propositions of the rational doctrine of the soul begin 
not from the concept of a thinking being in general but from an 
actuality; and from the way this is thought, after everything 
empirical has been detached from it, it is concluded what pertains to
a thinking being in general ... (<em>CPR</em>, B416-19)

 <a name="KantTDM"></a>Give
 a philosopher the concept of a triangle, and let him try to find out 
in his way how the sum of its angles might be related to a right 
angle. He has nothing but the concept of a figure enclosed by three 
straight lines, and in it the concept of equally many angles. Now he 
may reflect on this concept as long as he wants, yet he will never 
produce anything new. He can analyze [<em>zergliedern</em>] and make 
distinct the concept of a straight line, or of an angle, or of the 
number three, but he will not come upon any other properties that do 
not already lie in these concepts. But now let the geometer take up 
this question. He begins at once to construct a triangle. Since he 
knows that two right angles together are exactly equal to all of the 
adjacent angles that can be drawn at one point on a straight line, he
extends one side of his triangle, and obtains two adjacent angles 
that together are equal to two right ones. Now he divides the 
external one of these angles by drawing a line parallel to the 
opposite side of the triangle, and sees that here there arises an 
external adjacent angle which is equal to an internal one, etc. In 
such a way, through a chain of inferences that is always guided by 
intuition, he arrives at a fully illuminating and at the same time 
general solution of the question. (<em>CPR</em>, A716-7/B744-5)

by contrast all the more useful if it comes after. For one will

In the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> I worked on this question [Is
metaphysics possible at all?] <em>synthetically</em>, namely by 
inquiring within pure reason itself, and seeking to determine within 
this source both the elements and the laws of its pure use, according
to principles. This work is difficult and requires a resolute reader 
to think himself little by little into a system that takes no 
foundation as given except reason itself, and that therefore tries to
develop cognition out of its original seeds without relying on any 
fact whatever. <em>Prolegomena</em> should by contrast be preparatory
exercises; they ought more to indicate what needs to be done in order
to bring a science into existence if possible, than to present the 
science itself. They must therefore rely on something already known 
to be dependable, from which we can go forward with confidence and 
ascend to the sources, which are not yet known, and whose discovery 
not only will explain what is known already, but will also exhibit an
area with many cognitions that all arise from these same sources. The
methodological procedure of prolegomena, and especially of those that
are to prepare for a future metaphysics, will therefore be 
<em>analytic</em>. (<em>PFM</em>, 4:274-5/ 25-6)

 <a name="LeibnizUSA"></a>Synthesis
 is when, beginning from principles and running through truths in 
order, we discover certain progressions and form tables, as it were, 
or sometimes even general formulae, in which the answers to what 
arises later can be discovered. Analysis, however, goes back to 
principles solely for the sake of a given problem, just as if nothing
had been discovered previously, by ourselves or by others. It is 
better to produce a synthesis, since that work is of permanent value,
whereas when we begin an analysis on account of particular problems 
we often do what has been done before. However, to use a synthesis 
which has been established by others, and theorems which have already
been discovered, is less of an art than to do everything by oneself 
by carrying out an analysis; especially as what has been discovered 
by others, or even by ourselves, does not always occur to us or come 
to hand. There are two kinds of analysis: one is the common type 
proceeding by leaps, which is used in algebra, and the other is a 
special kind which I call &lsquo;reductive&rsquo;. This is much more 
elegant, but is less well-known. In practice, analysis is more 
necessary, so that we may solve the problems which are presented to 
us; but the man who can indulge in theorising will be content to 
practice analysis just far enough to master the art. For the rest, he
will rather practise synthesis, and will apply himself readily only 
to those questions to which order itself leads him. For in this way 
he will always progress pleasantly and easily, and will never feel 
any difficulties, nor be disappointed of success, and in a short time
he will achieve much more than he would ever have hoped for at the 
outset. (<em>USA</em>, 16-17)

There are therefore <em>three ways whereby we get the complex</em> 
Ideas <em>of mixed Modes</em>. 1. By Experience and 
<em>Observation</em> of things themselves. Thus by seeing two Men 
wrestle, or fence, we get the <em>Idea</em> of wrestling or fencing. 
2. By <em>Invention</em>, or voluntary putting together of several 
simple <em>Ideas</em> in our own Minds: So he that first invented 
Printing, or Etching, had an <em>Idea</em> of it in his Mind, before 
it ever existed. 3. Which is the most usual way, by <em>explaining 
the names</em> of Actions we never saw, or Notions we cannot see; and
by enumerating, and thereby, as it were, setting before our 
Imaginations all those <em>Ideas</em> which go to the making them up,
and are the constituent parts of them. For having by 
<em>Sensation</em> and <em>Reflection</em> stored our Minds with 
simple <em>Ideas</em>, and by use got the Names, that stand for them,
we can by those Names represent to another any complex <em>Idea</em>,
we would have him conceive; so that it has in it no simple 
<em>Idea</em>, but what he knows, and has, with us, the same name 
for. For all our complex <em>Ideas</em> are ultimately resolvable 
into simple <em>Ideas</em>, of which they are compounded, and 
originally made up, though perhaps their immediate Ingredients, as I 
may so say, are also complex <em>Ideas</em>. Thus the <em>mixed

The certainty of mathematics is based upon the general axiom that 
nothing can be and not be at the same time. In this science each 
proposition such as, for example, &ldquo;A is B&rdquo;, is proven in 
one of two ways. Either one unpacks the concepts of A and shows 
&ldquo;A is B&rdquo;, or one unpacks the concepts of B and infers 
from this that not-B must also be not-A. Both types of proof are thus
based upon the principle of contradiction, and since the object of 
mathematics in general is <em>magnitude</em> and that of geometry in 
particular <em>extension</em>, one can say that in mathematics in 
general our concepts of magnitude are unpacked and analyzed, while in
geometry in particular our concepts of extension are unpacked and 
analyzed. In fact, since geometry lays nothing else as its basis than
the abstract concept of extension and derives all its conclusions 
from this single source &ndash; deriving them, to be sure, in such a 
way that one recognizes distinctly that everything maintained in it 
is necessarily connected by the principle of contradiction with the 
abstracted concept of extension, there is no doubt that all geometric
truths that geometry teaches us to <em>unpack</em> or 
<em>untangle</em> from the concept of extension must be encountered 
all <em>tangled up</em> in it. For what else can the profoundest 
inferences do but analyze a concept and make distinct what was 
obscure? Such inferences cannot bring in what is not to be found in 
the concept, and it is easy to see that it is also not possible, by 
means of the principle of contradiction, to derive from the concept 
what is not to be found in it. In the concept of extension, for 
example, there lies the inner possibility that a space is limited by 
three straight lines in such a way that two of them include a right 
angle. For it follows from the essence of extension that it is 
capable of many sorts of limitations and that the assumed sort of 
limitation of one of its level planes contains no contradiction. If 
one subsequently shows that the concept of this assumed limitation or
of a right-angled triangle necessarily entails that the square of the
hypotenuse is such-and-such, then it must have also been possible to 
find this truth originally and implicitly in the initial concept of 
extension. Otherwise it could never have been derived from it by 
means of the principle of contradiction. The idea of extension is 
inseparable from the idea of the possibility of such a limitation, as
was previously assumed, and the limitation is in turn necessarily 
connected to the concept of the equality of the aforesaid square. 
Thus, this truth also lay tangled up, as one might say, in the 
original concept of extension, but it escaped our attention and could
not be distinctly known and distinguished until, through analysis, we
unpacked all the parts of this concept and separated them from one 
another. The analysis of concepts is for the understanding nothing 
more than what the maginfying glass is for sight. It does not produce
anything that was not to be found in the object. But it spreads out 
the parts of the object and makes it possible for our senses to 
distinguish much that they would otherwise not have noticed. The 
analysis of concepts does nothing different from this; it makes the 
parts and members of these concepts, which were previously obscure 
and unnoticed, distinct and recognizable, but it does not introduce 
anything into the concepts that was not already to be found in them.

 <a name="MoorePE"></a>It
 appears to me that in Ethics, as in all other philosophical studies, 
the difficulties and disagreements, of which its history is full, are
mainly due to a very simple cause: namely to the attempt to answer 
questions, without first discovering precisely what question it is 
which you desire to answer. I do not know how far this source of 
error would be done away, if philosophers would try to discover what 
question they were asking, before they set about to answer it; for 
the work of analysis and distinction is often very difficult: we may 
often fail to make the necessary discovery, even though we make a 
definite attempt to do so. But I am inclined to think that in many 
cases a resolute attempt would be sufficient to ensure success; so 
that, if only this attempt were made, many of the most glaring 
difficulties and disagreements in philosophy would disappear.

My point is that &lsquo;good&rsquo; is a simple notion, just as 
&lsquo;yellow&rsquo; is a simple notion; that, just as you cannot, by
any manner of means, explain to any one who does not already know it,
what yellow is, so you cannot explain what good is. Definitions of 
the kind that I was asking for, definitions which describe the real 
nature of the object or notion denoted by a word, and which do not 
merely tell us what the word is used to mean, are only possible when 
the object or notion in question is something complex. You can give a
definition of a horse, because a horse has many different properties 
and qualities, all of which you can enumerate. But when you have 
enumerated them all, when you have reduced a horse to his simplest 
terms, then you no longer define those terms. They are simply 
something which you think of or perceive, and to any one who cannot 
think of or perceive them, you can never, by any definition, make 
their nature known. (<em>PE</em>, 7)

As in Mathematicks, so in Natural Philosophy, the Investigation of 
difficult Things by the Method of Analysis, ought ever to precede the
Method of Composition. This Analysis consists in making Experiments 
and Observations, and in drawing general Conclusions from them by 
Induction, and admitting of no Objections against the Conclusions, 
but such as are taken from Experiments, or other certain Truths. For 
Hypotheses are not to be regarded in experimental Philosophy. And 
although the arguing from Experiments and Observations by Induction 
be no Demonstration of general Conclusions; yet it is the best way of
arguing which the Nature of Things admits of, and may be looked upon 
as so much the stronger, by how much the Induction is more general. 
And if no Exception occur from Ph&aelig;nomena, the Conclusion may be
pronounced generally. But if at any time afterwards any Exception 
shall occur from Experiments, it may then begin to be pronounced with
such Exceptions as occur. By this way of Analysis we may proceed from
Compounds to Ingredients, and from Motions to the Forces producing 
them; and in general, from Effects to their Causes, and from 
particular Causes to more general ones, till the Argument end in the 
most general. This is the Method of Analysis: and the Synthesis 
consists in assuming the Causes discover&rsquo;d, and 
establish&rsquo;d as Principles, and by them explaining the 
Ph&aelig;nomena proceeding from them, and proving the Explanations.

The so-called Treasury of Analysis [<em>analuomenos</em>] .. is, in 
short, a special body of doctrines furnished for the use of those 
who, after going through the usual elements, wish to obtain the power
of solving theoretical problems, which are set to them, and for this 
purpose only is it useful. It is the work of three men, Euclid the 
author of the <em>Elements</em>, Apollonius of Perga, and Aristaeus 
the Elder, and proceeds by the method of analysis and synthesis.</p>
<p>

Now analysis is the way from what is sought&mdash;as if it were 
admitted&mdash;through its concomitants [<em>akolouth&ocirc;n</em>] 
in order to something admitted in synthesis. For in analysis we 
suppose that which is sought to be already done, and we inquire from 
what it results, and again what is the antecedent 
[<em>pro&ecirc;goumenon</em>] of the latter, until we on our backward
way light upon something already known and being first in order. And 
we call such a method analysis, as being a solution backwards 
[<em>anapalin lysin</em>].</p>
<p>

In synthesis, on the other hand, we suppose that which was reached 
last in analysis to be already done, and arranging in their natural 
order as consequents [<em>epomena</em>] the former antecedents 
[<em>pro&ecirc;goumena</em>] and linking them one with another, we in
the end arrive at the construction of the thing sought. And this we 
call synthesis.</p>
<p>

Now analysis is of two kinds. One seeks the truth, being called 
theoretical. The other serves to carry out what was desired to do, 
and this is called problematical. In the theoretical kind we suppose 
the thing sought as being and as being true, and then we pass through
its concomitants [<em>akolouth&ocirc;n</em>] in order, as though they
were true and existent by hypothesis, to something admitted; then, if
that which is admitted be true, the thing sought is true, too, and 
the proof will be the reverse of analysis. But if we come upon 
something false to admit, the thing sought will be false, too. In the
problematic kind we suppose the desired thing to be known, and then 
we pass through its concomitants [<em>akolouth&ocirc;n</em>] in 
order, as though they were true, up to something admitted. If the 
thing admitted is possible or can be done, that is, if it is what the
mathematicians call given, the desired thing will also be possible. 
The proof will again be the reverse of analysis. But if we come upon 
something impossible to admit, the problem will also be impossible.

For we should remember that if a person goes on analyzing names into
words, and inquiring also into the elements out of which the words are
formed, and keeps on always repeating this process, he who has to
answer him must at last give up the inquiry in despair &hellip; But if
we take a word which is incapable of further resolution, then we shall
be right in saying that we at last reached a primary element, which
need not be resolved any further. (&lsquo;Cratylus&rsquo;, Benjamin

Then, said I, is not dialectic the only process of inquiry that
advances in this manner, doing away with hypotheses, up to the first
principle itself in order to find confirmation there? And it is
literally true that when the eye of the soul is sunk in the barbaric
slough of the Orphic Myth, dialectic gently draws it forth and leads
it up, employing as helpers and cooperators in this conversation the
studies and sciences which we enumerated, which we called sciences
often from habit, though they really need some other designation,
connoting more clearness than opinion and more obscurity than
science. &lsquo;Understanding&rsquo; I believe was the term we
employed. But, I presume we shall not dispute about the name when
things of such moment lie before us for

Understand then, said I, that by the other section of the intelligible
I mean that which the reason lays hold of by the power of dialectic,
treating its assumptions not as absolute beginnings but literally as
hypotheses, underpinnings, footings and springboards so to speak, to
enable it to rise to that which requires no assumption and is the
starting point of all, and after attaining to that again taking hold
of the first dependencies from it, so to proceed downward to the
conclusion, making no use whatever of any object of sense but only of
pure ideas moving on through ideas to ideas and ending with
ideas. (&lsquo;Republic VI&rsquo;, Paul Shorey (trans.),

<em>Nonmathematical illustration [of the method of analysis described
by Pappus]</em>. A primitive man wishes to cross a creek; but he 
cannot do so in the usual way because the water has risen overnight. 
Thus, the crossing becomes the object of a problem; &ldquo;crossing 
the creek&rsquo; is the <em>x</em> of this primitive problem. The man
may recall that he has crossed some other creek by walking along a 
fallen tree. He looks around for a suitable fallen tree which becomes
his new unknown, his <em>y</em>. He cannot find any suitable tree but
there are plenty of trees standing along he creek; he wishes that one
of them would fall. Could he make a tree fall across the creek? There
is a great idea and there is a new unknown; by what means could he 
tilt the tree over the creek?</p>
<p>

This train of ideas ought to be called analysis if we accept the 
terminology of Pappus. If the primitive man succeeds in finishing his
analysis he may become the inventor of the bridge and of the axe. 
What will be the synthesis? Translation of ideas into actions. The 
finishing act of the synthesis is walking along a tree across the 
creek.</p>
<p>

The same objects fill the analysis and the synthesis; they exercise 
the mind of the man in the analysis and his muscles in the synthesis;
the analysis consists in thoughts, the synthesis in acts. There is 
another difference; the order is reversed. Walking across the creek 
is the first desire from which the analysis starts and it is the last
act with which the synthesis ends. (1957, 145)

as Nous is set over understanding and dispenses principles to it from
above, perfecting it out of its own riches, so in the same way 
dialectic, the purest part of philosophy, hovers attentively over 
mathematics, encompasses its whole development, and of itself 
contributes to the special sciences their various perfecting, 
critical, and intellective powers&mdash;the procedures, I mean, of 
analysis, division, definition, and demonstration. Being thus endowed
and led towards perfection, mathematics reaches some of its results 
by analysis, others by synthesis, expounds some matters by division, 
others by definition, and some of its discoveries binds fast by 
demonstration, adapting these methods to its subjects and employing 
each of them for gaining insight into mediating ideas. Thus its 
analyses are under the control of dialectic, and its definitions, 
divisions, and demonstrations are of the same family and unfold in 
conformity with the way of mathematical understanding. It is 
reasonable, then, to say that dialectic is the capstone of the 
mathematical sciences. It brings to perfection all the intellectual 
insight they contain, making what is exact in them more irrefutable, 
confirming the stability of what they have established and referring 
what is pure and incorporeal in them to the simplicity and 
immateriality of Nous, making precise their primary starting-points 
through definitions and explicating the distinctions of genera and 
species within their subject-matters, teaching the use of synthesis 
to bring out the consequences that follow from principles and of 
analysis to lead up to the first principles and starting-points.

Magnitudes, figures and their boundaries, and the ratios that are 
found in them, as well as their properties, their various positions 
and motions&mdash;these are what geometry studies, proceeding from 
the partless point down to solid bodies, whose many species and 
differences it explores, then following the reverse path from the 
more complex objects to the simpler ones and their principles. It 
makes use of synthesis and analysis, always starting from hypotheses 
and first principles that it obtains from the science above it and 
employing all the procedures of dialectic&mdash;definition and 
division for establishing first principles and articulating species 
and genera, and demonstrations and analyses in dealing with the 
consequences that follow from first principles, in order to show the 
more complex matters both as proceeding from the simpler and also 
conversely as leading back to them. (<em>CEE</em>, 57/46)

there are certain methods that have been handed down, the best being 
the method of analysis, which traces the desired result back to an 
acknowledged principle. Plato, it is said, taught this method to 
Leodamas, who also is reported to have made many discoveries in 
geometry by means of it. A second is the method of 
<em>diaeresis</em>, which divides into its natural parts the genus 
proposed for examination and which affords a starting-point for 
demonstration by eliminating the parts irrelevant for the 
establishment of what is proposed. This method also Plato praised as 
an aid in all the sciences. A third is the reduction to 
impossibility, which does not directly show the thing itself that is 
wanted but by refuting its contradictory indirectly establishes its 
truth. (<em>CEE</em>, 211-12/165-6)

In general we must understand that all mathematical arguments proceed
either from or to the starting-points, as Porphyry somewhere says. 
Those that proceed from the starting-points are themselves of two 
kinds, as it happens, for they proceed either from common notions, 
that is, from self-evident clarity alone, or from things previously 
demonstrated. Those that proceed to the starting-points are either 
affirmative of them or destructive. But those that affirm first 
principles are called &ldquo;analyses&rdquo;, and their reverse 
procedures &ldquo;syntheses&rdquo; (for it is possible from those 
principles to proceed in orderly fashion to the thing sought, and 
this is called &ldquo;synthesis&rdquo;); when they are destructive, 
they are called &ldquo;reductions to impossibility&rdquo;, for it is 
the function of this procedure to show that something generally 
accepted and self-evident is overthrown. There is a kind of syllogism
in it, though not the same as in analysis ... (<em>CEE</em>,

A <em>maxim of shallow analysis</em> prevails: <em>expose no more 
logical structure than seems useful</em> for the deduction or other 
inquiry at hand. In the immortal words of Adolf Meyer, where it 
doesn&rsquo;t itch don't scratch.</p>

<p>

On occasion the useful degree of analysis may, conversely, be such as
to cut into a simple word of ordinary language, requiring its 
paraphrase into a composite term in which other terms are compounded 
with the help of canonical notation. When this happens, the line of 
analysis adopted will itself commonly depend on what is sought in the
inquiry at hand; again there need be no question of the uniquely 
right analysis, nor of synonymy. (1960, &sect;33, 160-1)

<li><p>

This construction [of the ordered pair as a class, such as 
Wiener&rsquo;s identification of the ordered pair <em>x</em>, 
<em>y</em>> with the class {{<em>x</em>}, {<em>y</em>, &Lambda;}}] is
paradigmatic of what we are most typically up to when in a 
philosophical spirit we offer an &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;explication&rdquo; of some hitherto inadequately formulated 
&ldquo;idea&rdquo; or expression. We do not claim synonymy. We do not
claim to make clear and explicit what the users of the unclear 
expression had unconsciously in mind all along. We do not expose 
hidden meanings, as the words &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;explication&rsquo; would suggest; we supply lacks. We fix on 
the particular functions of the unclear expression that make it worth
troubling about, and then devise a substitute, clear and couched in 
terms to our liking, that fills those functions. Beyond those 
conditions of partial agreement, dictated by our interests and 
purposes, any traits of the explicans come under the head of 
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t-cares&rdquo; &hellip; Under this head we are free to 
allow the explicans all manner of novel connotations never associated
with the explicandum. &hellip;</p>

<p> Philosophical analysis, explication, has not always been seen in
this way. Only the reading of a synonymy claim into analysis could
engender the so-called paradox of analysis, which runs thus: how can a
correct analysis be informative, since to understand it we must
already know the meanings of its terms, and hence already know that
the terms which it equates are synonymous? The notion that analysis
must consist somehow in the uncovering of hidden meanings underlies
also the recent tendency of some of the Oxford philosophers to take as
their business an examination of the subtle irregularities of ordinary
language. And there is no mistaking the obliviousness of various
writers to the point about the don&rsquo;t-cares. &hellip;</p>

<p>

... <em>explication is elimination</em>. We have, to begin with, an 
expression or form of expression that is somehow troublesome. It 
behaves partly like a term but not enough so, or it is vague in ways 
that bother us, or it puts kinks in a theory or encourages one or 
another confusion. But also it serves certain purposes that are not 
to be abandoned. Then we find a way of accomplishing those same 
purposes through other channels, using other and less troublesome 
forms of expression. The old perplexities are resolved.</p>

<p>

According to an influential doctrine of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s, the 
task of philosophy is not to solve problems but to dissolve them by 
showing that there were really none there. This doctrine has its 
limitations, but it aptly fits explication. For when explication 
banishes a problem it does so by showing it to be in an important 
sense unreal; viz., in the sense of proceeding only from needless 
usages. (1960, &sect;53, 258-60)

This brings us to the second of the five turning points, the shift 
from terms to sentences. The medievals had the notion of 
syncategorematic words, but it was a contemporary of John Horne Tooke
who developed it into an explicit theory of contextual definition; 
namely, Jeremy Bentham. He applied contextual definition not just to 
grammatical particles and the like, but even to some genuine terms, 
categorematic ones. If he found some term convenient but 
ontologically embarrassing, contextual definition enabled him in some
cases to continue to enjoy the services of the term while disclaiming
its denotation. He could declare the term syncategorematic, despite 
grammatical appearances, and then could justify his continued use of 
it if he could show systematically how to paraphrase as wholes all 
sentences in which he chose to imbed it. Such was his theory of 
fictions: what he called paraphrasis, and what we now call contextual
definition. The term, like the grammatical particles, is meaningful 
as a part of meaningful wholes. If every sentence in which we use a 
term can be paraphrased into a sentence that makes good sense, no 
more can be asked. (1975, 68-9)

The issue is: is there such an activity as &ldquo;conceptual
analysis&rdquo; or can philosophers do no more than describe usage
and, perhaps, make recommendations for change in usage? One&rsquo;s
answer to this question will determine whether one thinks that
Wittgenstein was wrong to give up on the idea of a systematic theory
of meaning, and Quine right to suggest that the very notion of
&ldquo;meaning&rdquo; was a hangover of Aristotelean essentialism. If
they were right, it is hard to hang on to the idea that
&ldquo;conceptual clarity&rdquo; is a goal of philosophical inquiry
&hellip; Metaphilosophical issues hover in the wings of the debates over
whether the content of an assertion varies from utterer to utterer and
from audience to audience. If it does not, if something remains
invariable &ndash; the concepts expressed by the words that make up the
sentence &ndash; then perhaps there really are entities with intrinsic
properties which philosophical analysis can hope to pin down. But, if
content does vary in this way, then concepts are like persons - never
quite the same twice, always developing, always maturing. You can
change a concept by changing usage, but you cannot get a concept
right, once and for all. (&lsquo;Analytic and Conversational

we must see <em>where we are going</em>, or what will 
&ldquo;count&rdquo; as the successful resolution to the given 
exercise of analysis. &hellip; Analysis is the admittedly indispensable 
road to our destination, but it is no more the destination than it is
the intention to begin the voyage. One could perhaps say that the 
destination is an articulated structure. But we know that we have 
reached the destination only when we recognize a given articulation 
as the <em>explanation</em> of that structure. We cannot see that an 
analysis explains a structure by performing an additional step in the
analysis. At some point we must see that we are finished. And to see 
an analysis is not to analyze. It is rather to see an articulated 
structure as a unity, whole, or synthesis. (<em>Ibid</em>., 9)

If to understand is to possess an explanation, and if an explanation 
is an analysis, it remains the case that an analysis is intelligible 
because it is also a synthesis. Explanation may be called 
&ldquo;recollection&rdquo; in the Platonic sense because it is the 
process of retracing, by the method of counting and measuring, the 
joints of an internally articulated unity, one prefigured within the 
initial formulation of the entire analytical exercise. In slightly 
more prosaic terms, analysis is never merely the application of 
rules. It is also at once a seeing of which rules to apply and how to
apply them. This is what it means to say that analysis is also 
synthesis. And this is why it is false to say, as is at least implied
by so much contemporary analytical philosophy, that we begin with 
intuitions and then replace them with ever more sophisticated 
analyses. Not only is it false to say this, but strictly speaking, it
is meaningless. If &ldquo;to mean&rdquo; is &ldquo;to provide an 
analysis&rdquo;, there is no analysis of analysis without ingredient 
intuition. Without intuition, there is at each stage nothing to 
analyze. Intuition (of syntheses or unities) without analysis is 
mute, but analysis without intuition is inarticulate as well as 
blind: the sounds it utters cannot be distinguished from noise.

That all sound philosophy should begin with an analysis of 
propositions, is a truth too evident, perhaps, to demand a proof. 
That Leibniz&rsquo;s philosophy began with such an analysis, is less

<li><p> It is necessary to realize that definition, in mathematics,
does not mean, as in philosophy, an analysis of the idea to be defined
into constituent ideas. This notion, in any case, is only applicable
to concepts, whereas in mathematics it is possible to define terms
which are not concepts. Thus also many notions are defined by symbolic
logic which are not capable of philosophical definition, since they
are simple and unanalyzable. (<em>POM</em>, ch. 2, &sect;31, 27) {<a

For the comprehension of analysis, it is necessary to investigate the
notion of whole and part, a notion which has been wrapped in 
obscurity&mdash;though not without certain more or less valid logical
reasons&mdash;by the writers who may be roughly called Hegelian.

<li><p>

I have already touched on a very important logical doctrine, which 
the theory of whole and part brings into prominence&mdash;I mean the 
doctrine that analysis is falsification. Whatever can be analyzed is 
a whole, and we have already seen that analysis of wholes is in some 
measure falsification. But it is important to realize the very narrow
limits of this doctrine. We cannot conclude that the parts of a whole
are not really its parts, nor that the parts are not presupposed in 
the whole in a sense in which the whole is not presupposed in the 
parts, nor yet that the logically prior is not usually simpler than 
the logically subsequent. In short, though analysis gives us the 
truth, and nothing but the truth, yet it can never give us the whole 
truth. This is the only sense in which the doctrine is to be 
accepted. In any wider sense, it becomes merely a cloak for laziness,
by giving an excuse to those who dislike the labour of analysis. 
(<em>POM</em>, ch. 16, &sect;138, 141) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.3">&sect;6.3</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

We are sometimes told that things are organic unities, composed of 
many parts expressing the whole and expressed in the whole. This 
notion is apt to replace the older notion of substance, not, I think,
to the advantage of precise thinking. The only kind of unity to which
I can attach any precise sense&mdash;apart from the unity of the 
absolutely simple&mdash;is that of a whole composed of parts. But 
this form of unity cannot be what is called organic; for if the parts
express the whole or the other parts, they must be complex, and 
therefore themselves contain parts; if the parts have been analyzed 
as far as possible, they must be simple terms, incapable of 
expressing anything except themselves. A distinction is made, in 
support of organic unities, between conceptual analysis and real 
division into parts. What is really indivisible, we are told, may be 
conceptually analyzable. This distinction, if the conceptual analysis
be regarded as subjective, seems to me wholly inadmissible. All 
complexity is conceptual in the sense that it is due to a whole 
capable of logical analysis, but is real in the sense that it has no 
dependence upon the mind, but only upon the nature of the object. 
Where the mind can distinguish elements, there must <em>be</em> 
different elements to distinguish; though, alas! there are often 
different elements which the mind does not distinguish. The analysis 
of a finite space into points is no more objective than the analysis 
(say) of causality into time-sequence + ground and consequent, or of 
equality into sameness of relation to a given magnitude. In every 
case of analysis, there is a whole consisting of parts with 
relations; it is only the nature of the parts and the relations which
distinguishes different cases. Thus the notion of an organic whole in
the above sense must be attributed to defective analysis, and cannot 
be used to explain things.</p>
<p>

It is also said that analysis is falsification, that the complex is 
not equivalent to the sum of its constituents and is changed when 
analyzed into these. In this doctrine, as we saw in Parts I and II, 
there is a measure of truth, when what is to be analyzed is a unity. 
A proposition has a certain indefinable unity, in virtue of which it 
is an assertion; and this is so completely lost by analysis that no 
enumeration of constituents will restore it, even though itself be 
mentioned as a constituent. There is, it must be confessed, a grave 
logical difficulty in this fact, for it is difficult not to believe 
that a whole must be constituted by its constituents. For us, 
however, it is sufficient to observe that all unities are 
propositions or propositional concepts, and that consequently nothing
that exists is a unity. If, therefore, it is maintained that things 
are unities, we must reply that no things exist. (<em>POM</em>, ch. 
53, &sect;439, 466-7)

<li><p>

What we want to be clear about is the twofold method of analysis of a
proposition, <em>i.e.</em>, first taking the proposition as it stands
and analyzing it, second taking the proposition as a special case of 
a <em>type</em> of propositions. Whenever we use variables, we are 
already necessarily concerned with a <em>type</em> of propositions. 
E.g. &ldquo;<em>p</em> &sup; <em>q</em>&rdquo; stands for any 
proposition of a certain type. When values are assigned to <em>p</em>
and <em>q</em>, we reach a particular proposition by a different road
from that which would have started with those values plus 
implication, and have so built up the particular proposition without 
reference to a type. This is how functions come in.

 <a name="RussellTK"></a><em>Analysis</em>
 may be defined as the discovery of the constituents and the manner of
combination of a given complex. The complex is to be one with which 
we are acquainted; the analysis is <em>complete</em> when we become 
acquainted with all the constituents and with their manner of 
combination, and know that there are no more constituents and that 
that is their manner of combination. We may distinguish 
<em>formal</em> analysis as the discovery of the manner of 
combination, and <em>material</em> analysis as the discovery of the 
constituents. Material analysis may be called <em>descriptive</em> 
when the constituents are only known by description, not by 
acquaintance. (<em>TK</em>, 119)

Philosophy, if what has been said is correct, becomes 
indistinguishable from logic as that word has now come to be used. 
The study of logic consists, broadly speaking, of two not very 
sharply distinguished portions. On the one hand it is concerned with 
those general statements which can be made concerning everything 
without mentioning any one thing or predicate or relation, such for 
example as &lsquo;if <em>x</em> is a member of the class 
<em>&alpha;</em> and every member of <em>&alpha;</em> is a member of 
<em>&beta;</em>, then <em>x</em> is a member of the class 
<em>&beta;</em>, whatever <em>x</em>, <em>&alpha;</em>, and 
<em>&beta;</em> may be.&rsquo;. On the other hand, it is concerned 
with the analysis and enumeration of logical <em>forms</em>, i.e. 
with the kinds of propositions that may occur, with the various types
of facts, and with the classification of the constituents of facts. 
In this way logic provides an inventory of possibilities, a repertory
of abstractly tenable hypotheses. (<em>SMP</em>, 84-5) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.3">&sect;6.3</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

The essence of philosophy as thus conceived is analysis, not 
synthesis. To build up systems of the world, like Heine&rsquo;s German
professor who knit together fragments of life and made an 
intelligible system out of them, is not, I believe, any more feasible
than the discovery of the philosopher&rsquo;s stone. What is feasible
is the understanding of general forms, and the division of 
traditional problems into a number of separate and less baffling 
questions. &lsquo;Divide and conquer&rsquo; is the maxim of success 
here as elsewhere. (<em>SMP</em>, 86) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.3">&sect;6.3</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

Kant, under the influence of Newton, adopted, though with some 
vacillation, the hypothesis of absolute space, and this hypothesis, 
though logically unobjectionable, is removed by Occam&rsquo;s razor, 
since absolute space is an unnecessary entity in the explanation of 
the physical world. Although, therefore, we cannot refute the Kantian
theory of an <em>a priori</em> intuition, we can remove its grounds 
one by one through an analysis of the problem. Thus, here as in many 
other philosophical questions, the analytic method, while not capable
of arriving at a demonstrative result, is nevertheless capable of 
showing that all the positive grounds in favour of a certain theory 
are fallacious and that a less unnatural theory is capable of 
accounting for the facts.</p>
<p>

Another question by which the capacity of the analytic method can be 
shown is the question of realism. Both those who advocate and those 
who combat realism seem to me to be far from clear as to the nature 
of the problem which they are discussing. If we ask: &lsquo;Are our 
objects of perception <em>real</em> and are they <em>independent</em>
of the percipient?&rsquo; it must be supposed that we attach some 
meaning to the words &lsquo;real&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;independent&rsquo;, and yet, if either side in the controversy
of realism is asked to define these two words, their answer is pretty
sure to embody confusions such as logical analysis will reveal. 
(<em>SMP</em>, 90-1) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.3">&sect;6.3</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

The supreme maxim in scientific philosophizing is this:</p>
<p>

<em>Wherever possible, logical constructions are to be substituted 
for inferred entities.</em></p>
<p>

Some examples of the substitution of construction for inference in 
the realm of mathematical philosophy may serve to elucidate the uses 
of this maxim. Take first the case of irrationals. In old days, 
irrationals were inferred as the supposed limits of series of 
rationals which had no rational limit; but the objection to this 
procedure was that it left the existence of irrationals merely 
optative, and for this reason the stricter methods of the present day
no longer tolerate such a definition. We now define an irrational 
number as a certain class of ratios, thus constructing it logically 
by means of ratios, instead of arriving at it by a doubtful inference
from them. Take again the case of cardinal numbers. Two equally 
numerous collections appear to have something in common: this 
something is supposed to be their cardinal number. But so long as the
cardinal number is inferred from the collections, not constructed in 
terms of them, its existence must remain in doubt, unless in virtue 
of a metaphysical postulate <em>ad hoc</em>. By defining the cardinal
number of a given collection as the class of all equally numerous 
collections, we avoid the necessity of this metaphysical postulate, 
and thereby remove a needless element of doubt from the philosophy of
arithmetic. A similar method, as I have shown elsewhere, can be 
applied to classes themselves, which need not be supposed to have any
metaphysical reality, but can be regarded as symbolically constructed
fictions.</p>
<p>

The method by which the construction proceeds is closely analogous in
these and all similar cases. Given a set of propositions nominally 
dealing with the supposed inferred entities, we observe the 
properties which are required of the supposed entities in order to 
make these propositions true. By dint of a little logical ingenuity, 
we then construct some logical function of less hypothetical entities
which has the requisite properties. The constructed function we 
substitute for the supposed inferred entities, and thereby obtain a 
new and less doubtful interpretation of the body of propositions in 
question. This method, so fruitful in the philosophy of mathematics, 
will be found equally applicable in the philosophy of physics, where,
I do not doubt, it would have been applied long ago but for the fact 
that all who have studied this subject hitherto have been completely 
ignorant of mathematical logic. I myself cannot claim originality in 
the application of this method to physics, since I owe the suggestion
and the stimulus for its application entirely to my friend and 
collaborator Dr Whitehead, who is engaged in applying it to the more 
mathematical portions of the region intermediate between sense-data 
and the points, instants and particles of physics.</p>
<p>

A complete application of the method which substitutes constructions 
for inferences would exhibit matter wholly in terms of sense-data, 
and even, we may add, of the sense-data of a single person, since the
sense-data of others cannot be known without some element of 
inference. This, however, must remain for the present an ideal, to be
approached as nearly as possible, but to be reached, if at all, only 
after a long preliminary labour of which as yet we can only see the 
very beginning. (<em>RSDP</em>, 115-6)

<li><p>

In the special sciences, when they have become fully developed, the 
movement is forward and synthetic, from the simpler to the more 
complex. But in philosophy we follow the inverse direction: from the 
complex and relatively concrete we proceed towards the simple and 
abstract by means of analysis, seeking, in the process, to eliminate 
the particularity of the original subject-matter, and to confine our 
attention entirely to the logical <em>form</em> of the facts 
concerned. (<em>OKEW</em>, 189-90)

 </p></li>


<li><p>

The nature of philosophic analysis &hellip; can now be stated in 
general terms. We start from a body of common knowledge, which 
constitutes our data. On examination, the data are found to be 
complex, rather vague, and largely interdependent logically. By 
analysis we reduce them to propositions which are as nearly as 
possible simple and precise, and we arrange them in deductive chains,
in which a certain number of initial propositions form a logical 
guarantee for all the rest. (<em>OKEW</em>, 214)

 </p></li>

<li><p>

it is very important to distinguish between a definition and an
analysis. All analysis is only possible in regard to what is complex,
and it always depends, in the last analysis, upon direct acquaintance
with the objects which are the meanings of certain simple symbols. It
is hardly necessary to observe that one does not define a thing but a
symbol. (<em>PLA</em>, 194) {<a href="bib6.html#6.3">&sect;6.3</a>}
</p></li>

<li><p>

Analysis is not the same thing as definition. You can define a term by
means of a correct description, but that does not constitute an
analysis. (<em>PLA</em>, 196) {<a href="bib6.html#6.3">&sect;6.3</a>}

Philosophy must then involve the exercise of systematic restatement. 
But this does not mean that it is a department of philology or 
literary criticism.</p>
<p>

Its restatement is not the substitution of one noun for another or 
one verb for another. That is what lexicographers and translators 
excel in. Its restatements are transmutations of syntax, and 
transmutations of syntax controlled not be desire for elegance or 
stylistic correctness but by desire to exhibit the forms of the facts
into which philosophy is the enquiry.</p>
<p>

I conclude, then, that there is, after all, a sense in which we can 
properly enquire and even say &ldquo;what it really means to say so 
and so&rdquo;. For we can ask what is the real form of the fact 
recorded when this is concealed or disguised and not duly exhibited 
by the expression in question. And we can often succeed in stating 
this fact in a new form of words which does exhibit what the other 
failed to exhibit. And I am for the present inclined to believe that 
this is what philosophical analysis is, and that this is the sole and
whole function of philosophy. (1932, 100)

false that this examination is a sort of garage inspection of one

dogmatically, it is always a traffic inspector&rsquo;s examination of
a conceptual traffic-block, involving at least two streams of 
vehicles hailing from the theories, or points of view or platitudes

[in discussing Ryle 1953 
 {<a href="#Ryle1953">Quotation</a>}]
 Personally, I have no axe to grind about what it takes to analyze a 
concept. Very likely, there are different sorts of cases. It may well
be that sometimes what we want from an analysis is the tracing of the
sort of intricate web of conceptual relations in which Ryle delights.
But there is little reason for thinking that this is always 
so&mdash;at least, if analysis is construed as whatever it is that 
philosophers do to solve their problems. What strikes me as worrisome
is Ryle&rsquo; tendency to use the web metaphor as a rationale for 
rejecting the old, Russellian conception of analysis, with its 
emphasis on precisely formulated logical forms, and replacing it with
methodology which, in some cases, may degenerate into a recipe for 
generating a conceptual fog. It is all well and good to recognize 
that sometimes the concepts philosophers deal with will be vague, 
imprecise, and open-ended, with close conceptual connections to other
concepts of the same sort. We do have to be able to deal with such 
cases&mdash;perhaps along the lines Ryle suggests. What is not good 
is a prior ideological commitment to blurred edges, indirectness, and
an unwillingness to separate tangential from central issues. 
Sometimes Ryle and other ordinary language philosophers seem to go 
too far in this direction; substituting one confining orthodoxy about
analysis for another. When this happens, central philosophical points
get missed ... (2003, II, 80-1)

<em>Philosophical analysis</em> is a term of art. At different times 
in the twentieth century, different authors have used it to mean 
different things. What is to be analyzed (e.g., words and sentences 
versus concepts and propositions), what counts as a successful 
analysis, and what philosophical fruits come from analysis are 
questions that have been vigorously debated since the dawn of 
analysis as a self-conscious philosophical approach. Often, different
views of analysis have been linked to different views of the nature 
of philosophy, the sources of philosophical knowledge, the role of 
language in thought, the relationship between language and the world,
and the nature of meaning&mdash;as well to more focused questions 
about necessary and apriori truth. Indeed the variety of positions is
so great as to make any attempt to extract a common denominator from 
the multiplicity of views sterile and not illuminating.</p>

<p>

Nevertheless analytic philosophy&mdash;with its emphasis on what is 
called &ldquo;philosophical analysis&rdquo;&mdash;is a clear and 
recognizable tradition. Although the common core of doctrine uniting 
its practitioners scarcely exceeds the platitudinous, a pattern of 
historical influence is not hard to discern. The tradition begins 
with G.E. Moore, Bertrand Russell, and Ludwig Wittgenstein (as well 
as Gottlob Frege, whose initial influence was largely filtered 
through Russell and Wittgenstein). These philosophers set the agenda,
first, for logical positivists such as Rudolf Carnap, Carl Hempel, 
and A.J. Ayer and then later for Wittgenstein, who in turn ushered in
the ordinary language school led by Gilbert Ryle and J.L. Austin. 
More recently the second half of the twentieth century has seen a 
revival of Russellian and Carnapian themes in the work of W.V. Quine,
Donald Davidson, and Saul Kripke. Analytic philosophy, with its 
changing views of philosophical analysis, is a trail of influence ...

In my opinion Logical Positivism fails in its treatment of analysis. 
Wittgenstein and the other Logical Positivists talk much about 
analysis, but they do not consider the various kinds of analysis, nor
do they show in what sense philosophy is the analysis of facts. They 
make use of analytic definition of a symbolic expression, and of the 
analytic clarification of a concept, but they do not distinguish 
between them. They also employ postulational analysis. But they do 
not seem to understand directional analysis, and, accordingly, they 
fail to apprehend the need for it. In this way they depart, in my 
opinion, from the practice of Moore. Not only is their conception of 
analysis defective, but, further, their conception of the 
<em>kinds</em> of facts to be analysed is inadequate. They treat all 
facts as <em>linguistic facts</em>. Hence, they suppose that the 
first problem of philosophy is to determine the principles of 
symbolism, and <em>from these principles</em> to draw limits with 
regard to what we <em>can</em> think. This assumption has two 
important consequences. First, it leads to the view that philosophy 
is &lsquo;the activity of finding meaning&rsquo;, to quote 
Schlick&rsquo;s statement. The second consequence is that they are 
apt to place too much reliance upon the construction of postulational
systems. (1933b, 82-3)

An analysis, I suppose, may be thought of as a kind of breaking down
or decomposing of something. So we have the picture of a kind of
intellectual taking to pieces of ideas or concepts; the discovering of
what elements a concept or idea is composed and how they are
related. Is this the right picture or the wrong one&mdash;or is it
partly right and partly wrong? That is a question which calls for a
considered response &hellip; (<em>Analysis and Metaphysics</em>, Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 1992, 2) </p></li>


<li><p>

If we took this notion [of analysis as decomposition] completely
seriously for the case of conceptual analysis&mdash;analysis of
ideas&mdash;we should conclude that our task was to find ideas that
were completely simple, that were free from internal conceptual
complexity; and then to demonstrate how the more or less complex ideas
that are of interest to philosophers could be assembled by a kind of
logical or conceptual construction out of these simple elements. The
aim would be to get a clear grasp of complex meanings by reducing
them, without remainder, to simple meanings. Thus baldly stated, this
may seem a rather implausible project. And so it is. Nevertheless it,
or some close relation of it, has been, and is, taken seriously. Even
when not taken to the lengths I have just described, it continues to
exercise a certain influence on the philosophical
mind. (<em>Ibid.</em> 18) </p></li>

Among the philosophers who were most influential in England in the
period between the two world wars were the analysts. Their analytic
theories were sometimes associated with the metaphysical view which
Russell called logical atomism, sometimes with the supposedly
anti-metaphysical doctrines of logical positivism, and sometimes, as
in the case of G. E. Moore, the analytic practice had no clearly
defined dogmatic background at all. But they were united at least in
the view that analysis was at least one of the most important tasks of
the philosopher; and by analysis they meant something which, whatever
precise description of it they chose, at least involved the attempt to
rewrite in different and in some way more appropriate terms those
statements which they found philosophically puzzling. (1956, vii) {<a
href="bib6.html#6.1">&sect;6.1</a>} </p></li>

<li><p>

analysis is a familiar philosophical method. I shall not attempt to 
offer you a complete historical account of analytic philosophy. Even 
the minute examination of a particular analytic philosopher, or group
of analytic philosophers, would not be of great interest. I propose 
rather to sketch, in broad strokes, four major forms of philosophical
analysis which I think important to distinguish carefully from one 
another. I shall call the first of these: classical analysis. It 
corresponds, roughly, to the traditional method of analysis used by 
English philosophers, a method which Russell did so much to develop. 
I shall then examine three other, more recent forms of philosophical 
analysis: (1) the type of analysis which involves the construction of
artificial languages; (2) the type of analysis practiced by 
Wittgenstein in his later period; (3) the type of analysis which 
characterizes present-day Oxford Philosophy.</p>
<p>

The fundamental notion of classical analysis is that propositions 
couched in ordinary language are correct, in the sense that they are 
not objectionable in principle. They are neither logically nor 
metaphysically absurd. On the other hand, insofar as the form of 
these propositions of ordinary language hides their true meaning, 
they are neither metaphysically nor logically satisfactory. The task 
of the analyst is, therefore, to reformulate them so that this 
meaning will be clearly and explicitly presented, rather then to 
reject them. To analyze, is to reformulate,&mdash;to translate into a
better wording. (1962, 294-5) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.1">&sect;6.1</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

The logical positivism of the Vienna Circle did not modify the 
methodology of classical analysis. However, because of the 
anti-metaphysical standpoint which was characteristic of positivism, 
it could not accept the notion of the goal of analysis as 
metaphysical discovery. For the positivists of this school, the goal 
of philosophical analysis is to clarify the language of science, a 
clarification which would result from, for example, elucidating the 
relationships between observation and theory, or between scientific 
concepts at different levels of abstraction. (<em>Ibid</em>., 296) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.1">&sect;6.1</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

A second school [or third school, after &lsquo;classical 
analysis&rsquo; and logical positivism] was inspired (largely, but 
not entirely) by the thought of Wittgenstein in his later period. 
Wittgenstein had himself been led tothis new point of view in his 
criticism of his own <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em> 
(<em>Logische-Philosophische Abhandlung</em>), a book which itself 
espoused implicitly a certain form of classical analysis. According 
to Wittgenstein, classical analysis rested upon a false conception of
language and of thought. ...</p>
<p>

... for an analyst of this sort, philosophical problems do not result
from ignorance of the precise meaning of a concept, but from an 
entirely false conception of its function. ... Such a false 
conception is what Ryle calls a &ldquo;category mistake&rdquo;. To 
resolve a philosophical problem, one should exhibit the generic 
character of the concepts involved in it, rather than attempting to 
give a perfect definition or explication of these concepts. ...</p>
<p>

This conception of philosophical analysis&mdash;of analysis as the 
resolution of conceptual enigmas&mdash;has sometimes been 
condescendingly called &ldquo;therapeutic positivism&rdquo;. 
(<em>Ibid</em>., 297-9) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.1">&sect;6.1</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

The fourth method of analysis ... is that of Oxford Philosophy. ...</p>
<p>

The analytic philosophers of the Cambridge School&mdash;for example, 
Russell and Wittgenstein&mdash;came to philosophy after considerable 
work in the sciences and in mathematics. Philosophy of mathematics 
was the first topic to which Russell applied his classical method of 
analysis. But the Oxford philosophers came to their subject, almost 
without exception, after extensive study of classics. Thus they were 
naturally interested in words, in syntax, and in (idioms. They did 
not wish to use linguistic analysis simply to resolve philosophical 
problems; they were interested in the study of language for its own 
sake. Therefore these philosophers are, perhaps, both more given to 
making linguistic distinctions, and better at finding such 
distinctions, than most. <em>Ibid</em>., 299) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.1">&sect;6.1</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

Many English philosophers (including many who owe allegiance to 
Oxford Philosophy) would place themselves at a position between that 
of Wittgenstein and the view I have just sketched. It may therefore 
be in point to indicate briefly the principal differences between the
two schools:</p>
<p>

(1) Wittgensteinian analysis has, for its sole end, the resolution of
philosophical enigmas. If there were no such enigmas, there would be 
no need for analysis. For Oxford, on the other hand, analysis has an 
intrinsic value.</p>
<p>

(2) According to Wittgenstein and his disciples, all that is 
necessary is to exhibit the <em>generic</em> character of the 
concepts which we analyze. For Oxford, a minute analysis is 
indispensable.</p>
<p>

(3) For Wittgenstein, analysis is the only useful method in 
philosophy. For Oxford, it is only one among others, and no one 
claims that it is sufficient, by itself, to resolve all philosophical
problems. (<em>Ibid</em>., 301) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.1">&sect;6.1</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

It is not sensible to ask for <em>the</em> method of making 
one&lsquo;s fortune (or of ruining oneself); there are many. It is no
more sensible to ask &ldquo;What is the analytical method?&rdquo; 
There is not one &ldquo;analytic philosophy&rdquo;. There are 
several. (<em>Ibid</em>., 301 [closing sentences]) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.1">&sect;6.1</a>}
 </p></li>
</ol>

<h4><a name="Whitehead">Whitehead, Alfred North</a></h4>
<ol>
<li><p>

The primary weapon is analysis. And analysis is the evocation of 
insight by the hypothetical suggestions of thought, and the evocation
of thought by the activities of direct insight. In this process the 
composite whole, the interrelations, and the things related, 
concurrently emerge into clarity. (<em>Essays in Science and 
Philosophy</em>, New York: Philosophical Library, 1947, 157)</p></li></ol>

<h4><a name="Wilson">Wilson, John Cook</a></h4>
<ol>
<li><p>

Analysis is often understood to imply a whole of which the parts are
explicitly known before the analysis; but logical elements are for our
ordinary consciousness only implicit: we use them without reflecting
on them, just as we use grammatical distinctions long before we have
any knowledge of grammar. Logic does not merely analyse: it makes
explicit what was implicit. (<em>Statement and Inference</em>, Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 1926, 49)</p></li>

<li><p>The hypothetical process therefore combines in itself both the
method of discovery and the proof, and is the proper scientific
exposition. The non-hypothetical proof to which we are accustomed is a
sort of scientific pedantry, and it is consequently a great mistake
first to give what is called analysis, which corresponds to the
hypothetical process, and then to follow it by a synthesis, which is
the non-hypothetical part, thus putting aside analysis as if it were a
sort of accident. It is an error because it conceals the true process
of thinking. (<em>Ibid.</em>, 560) </p></li></ol>


<h4><a name="Wittgenstein">Wittgenstein, Ludwig</a></h4>
<ol>
<li><p>

I have changed my views on &ldquo;atomic&rdquo; complexes: I now 
think that qualities, relations (like love) etc. are all copulae! 
That means I for instance analyse a subject-predicate proposition, 
say, &ldquo;Socrates is human&rdquo; into &ldquo;Socrates&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;something is human&rdquo;, (which I think is not complex). The
reason for this is a very fundamental one. I think that there cannot 
be different Types of things! In other words whatever can be 
symbolized by a simple proper name must belong to one type. And 
further: every theory of types must be rendered superfluous by a 
proper theory of symbolism: For instance if I analyse the proposition
Socrates is mortal into Socrates, mortality and (&exist;x,y) 
&isin;<sub>1</sub> (x,y) I want a theory of types to tell me that 
&ldquo;mortality is Socrates&rdquo; is nonsensical, because if I 
treat &ldquo;mortality&rdquo; as a proper name (as I did) there is 
nothing to prevent me to make the substitution the wrong way round. 
<em>But</em> if I analyse (as I do now) into Socrates and 
(&exist;x).x is mortal or generally into x and (&exist;x) &phi;x it 
becomes impossible to substitute the wrong way round because the two 
symbols are now of a different <em>kind</em> themselves. What I am 
<em>most</em> certain of is not however the correctness of my present
way of analysis, but of the fact that all theory of types must be 
done away with by a theory of symbolism showing that what seem to be 
<em>different kinds of things</em> are symbolized by different kinds 
of symbols which <em>cannot</em> possibly be substituted in one 
another&rsquo;s places. I hope I have made this fairly clear!</p>

<p>

Propositions which I formerly wrote &isin;<sub>2</sub> (a,R,b) I now 
write R(a,b) and analyse them into a,b and (&exist;x,y)R(x,y) [with 
(&exist;x,y)R(x,y) marked in the text as &ldquo;not complex&rdquo;] 
(<em>NB</em>, 121-2) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

How is it reconcilable with the task of philosophy, that logic should
take care of itself? If, for example, we ask: Is such and such a fact
of the subject-predicate form?, we must surely know what we mean by 
&ldquo;subject-predicate form&rdquo;. We must know <em>whether</em> 
there is such a form at all. How can we know this? &ldquo;From the 
signs&rdquo;. But how? For we haven&rsquo;t got any <em>signs</em> of
this form. We may indeed say: We have signs that behave like signs of
the subject-predicate form, but does that mean that there really must
be facts of this form? That is, when those signs are completely 
analysed? And here the question arises again: Does such a complete 
analysis exist? <em>And if not</em>: then what is the task of 
philosophy?!!? (<em>NB</em>, 2) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

Our difficulty now lies in the fact that to all appearances 
analysability, or its opposite, is not reflected in language. That is
to say: We can <em>not</em>, as it seems, gather from language alone 
whether for example there are real subject-predicate facts or not. 
But how COULD we <em>express</em> this fact or its opposite? <em>This
must</em> be <em>shewn</em>. (<em>NB</em>, 10) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

The trivial fact that a completely analysed proposition contains just
as many names as there are things contained in its reference 
[<em>Bedeutung</em>]; this fact is an example of the all-embracing 
representation of the world through language. (<em>NB</em>, 11) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

The completely analysed proposition must image its reference 
[<em>Bedeutung</em>]. (<em>NB</em>, 18) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

A question: can we manage without simple objects in LOGIC?</p>
<p>

<em>Obviously</em> propositions are possible which contain no simple 
signs, i.e. no signs which have an immediate reference 
[<em>Bedeutung</em>]. And these are really <em>propositions</em> 
making sense, nor do the definitions of their component parts have to
be attached to them.</p>
<p>

But it is clear that components of our propositions can be analysed 
by means of a definition, and must be, if we want to approximate to 
the real structure of the proposition. <em>At any rate, then, there 
is a process of analysis</em>. And can it not now be asked whether 
this process comes to an end? And if so: What will the end be?</p>
<p>

If it is true that every defined sign signifies <em>via</em> its 
definitions then presumably the chain of definitions must some time 
have an end. [Cf. <em>TLP</em> 3.261.]</p>
<p>

The analysed proposition mentions more than the unanalysed.</p>
<p>

Analysis makes the proposition more complicated than it was, but it 
cannot and must not make it more complicated than its meaning 
[<em>Bedeutung</em>] was from the first.</p>
<p>

When the proposition is just as complex as its reference 
[<em>Bedeutung</em>], then it is <em>completely</em> analysed.</p>
<p>

But the reference [<em>Bedeutung</em>] of our propositions is not 
infinitely complicated. (<em>NB</em>, 46) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

But it also seems certain that we do not infer the existence of 
simple objects from the existence of particular simple objects, but 
rather know them&mdash;by description, as it were&mdash;as the 
end-product of analysis, by means of a process that leads to them. 
(<em>NB</em>, 50) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

Let us assume that every spatial object consists of infintely many 
points, then it is clear that I cannot mention all these by name when
I speak of that object. Here then would be a case in which I 
<em>cannot</em> arrive at the complete analysis in the old sense at 
all; and perhaps just this is the usual case.</p>
<p>

But this is surely clear: the propositions which are the only ones 
that humanity uses will have a sense just as they are and do not wait
upon a future analysis in order to acquire a sense.</p>
<p>

Now, however, it seems to be a legitimate question: 
Are&ndash;e.g.&ndash;spatial objects composed of simple parts; in 
analysing them, does one arrive at parts that cannot be further 
analysed, or is this not the case?</p>
<p>

&mdash;But what kind of question is this?&mdash;</p>
<p>

<em>Is it</em>, A PRIORI, <em>clear that in analysing we must arrive 
at simple components&mdash;is this, e.g., involved in the concept of 
analysis&mdash;</em>, or is analysis <em>ad infinitum</em> 
possible?&mdash;Or is there in the end even a third possibility? 
(<em>NB</em>, 62) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

In a proposition a thought can be expressed in such a way that 
elements of the propositional sign correspond to the objects of the 
thought.</p>
<p>

I call such elements &lsquo;simple signs&rsquo;, and such a 
proposition &lsquo;completely analysed&rsquo;. (<em>TLP</em>, 3.2, 
3.201) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

A proposition has one and only one complete analysis. (<em>TLP</em>, 
3.25) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

It is obvious that the analysis of propositions must bring us to 
elementary propositions which consist of names in immediate 
combination.</p>
<p>

This raises the question how such combination into propositions comes
about. (<em>TLP</em>, 4.221) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

If we know on purely logical grounds that there must be elementary 
propositions, then everyone who understands propositions in their 
unanalysed form must know it. (<em>TLP</em>, 5.5562) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

A proposition is completely logically analysed if its grammar is made
completely clear: no matter what idiom it may be written or expressed
in. (<em>PR</em>, 51; cf. <em>BT</em>, 308) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

Logical analysis is the analysis of something we have, not of 
something we don&rsquo;t have. Therefore it is the analysis of 
propositions <em>as they stand</em>. (<em>PR</em>, 52) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

a mathematical proof is an analysis of the mathematical proposition. 
(<em>PR</em>, 179) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

Complex is not like fact. For I can, e.g., say of a complex that it 
moves from one place to another, but not of a fact.</p>
<p>

But that this complex is now situated here is a fact. ...</p>
<p>

A complex is composed of its parts, the things of a kind which go to 
make it up. (This is of course a grammatical proposition concerning 
the words &lsquo;complex&rsquo;, &lsquo;part&rsquo; and 
&lsquo;compose&rsquo;.)</p>
<p>

To say that a red circle is <em>composed</em> of redness and 
circularity, or is a complex with these component parts, is a misuse 
of these words and is misleading. (Frege was aware of this and told 
me.) It is just as misleading to say the fact that this circle is red
(that I am tired) is a complex whose component parts are a circle and
redness (myself and tiredness).</p>
<p>

Neither is a house a complex of bricks and their spatial relations; 
i.e. that too goes against the correct use of the word. (<em>PR</em>,
301-2) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}
 </p></li>


<li><p>

When I say: &ldquo;My broom is in the corner&rdquo;,&mdash;is this 
really a statement about the broomstick and the brush? Well, it could
at any rate be replaced by a statement giving the position of the 
stick and the position of the brush. And this statement is surely a 
further analysed form of the first one.&mdash;But why do I call it 
&ldquo;further analysed&rdquo;?&mdash;Well, if the broom is there, 
that surely means that the stick and brush must be there, and in a 
particular relation to one another; and this was as it were hidden in
the sense of the first sentence, and is <em>expressed</em> in the 
analysed sentence. Then does someone who says that the broom is in 
the corner really mean: the broomstick is there, and so is the brush,
and the broomstick is fixed in the brush?&mdash;If we were to ask 
anyone if he meant this he would probably say that he had not thought
specially of the broomstick or specially of the brush at all. And 
that would be the <em>right</em> answer, for he meant to speak 
neither of the stick nor of the brush in particular. Suppose that, 
instead of saying &ldquo;Bring me the broom&rdquo;, you said 
&ldquo;Bring me the broomstick and the brush which is fitted on to 
it.&rdquo;!&mdash;Isn&rsquo;t the answer: &ldquo;DO you want the 
broom? Why do you put it so oddly?&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;Is he going to
understand the further analysed sentence better?&mdash;This sentence,
one might say, achieves the same as the ordinary one, but in a more 
roundabout way.&mdash; Imagine a language-game in which someone is 
ordered to bring certain objects which are composed of several parts,
to move them about, or something else of that kind. And two ways of 
playing it: in one (a) the composite objects (brooms, chairs, tables,
etc.) have names, as in (15); in the other (b) only the parts are 
given names and the wholes are described by means of them.&mdash;In 
what sense is an order in the second game an analysed form of an 
order in the first? Does the former lie concealed in the latter, and 
is it now brought out by analysis?&mdash;True, the broom is taken to 
pieces when one separates broomstick and brush; but does it follow 
that the order to bring the broom also consists of corresponding 
parts? ... </p>

<p>

To say, however, that a sentence in (b) is an &lsquo;analysed&rsquo; 
form of one in (a) readily seduces us into thinking that the former 
is the more fundamental form; that it alone shews what is meant by 
the other, and so on. For example, we think: If you have only the 
unanalysed form you miss the analysis; but if you know the analysed 
form that gives you everything.&mdash;But can I not say that an 
aspect of the matter is lost on you in the <em>latter</em> case as 
well as the former? (<em>PI</em>, &sect;&sect; 60, 63) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}

 <a name="WittgensteinPI90"></a>Our
 investigation is therefore a grammatical one. Such an investigation 
sheds light on our problem by clearing misunderstandings away. 
Misunderstandings concerning the use of words, caused, among other 
things, by certain analogies between the forms of expression in 
different regions of language.&mdash;Some of them can be removed by 
substituting one form of expression for another; this may be called 
an &ldquo;analysis&rdquo; of our forms of expression, for the process
is sometimes like one of taking a thing apart.</p>
<p>

But now it may come to look as if there were something like a final 
analysis of our forms of language, and so a <em>single</em> 
completely resolved form of every expression. That is, as if our 
usual forms of expression were, essentially, unanalysed; as if there 
were something hidden in them that had to be brought to light. When 
this is done the expression is completely clarified and our problem 
solved.</p>
<p>

It can also be put like this: we eliminate misunderstandings by 
making our expressions more exact; but now it may look as if we were 
moving towards a particular state, a state of complete exactness; and
as if this were the real goal of our investigation. (<em>PI</em>, 
&sect;&sect; 90-1) 
 {<a href="bib6.html#6.5">&sect;6.5</a>}

We are not analysing a phenomenon (e.g. thought) but a concept (e.g. 
that of thinking), and therefore the use of a word. (<em>PI</em>,

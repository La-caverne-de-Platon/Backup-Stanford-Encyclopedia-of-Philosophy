<h2>Indicating and Things</h2>

<p>
Less than 300 graphs long, the &ldquo;Discourse on Indicating
Things,&rdquo; has been the focus of intense interpretive attention
yet remains profoundly obscure. A reasonable conjecture is that its
author intended just this result. Interpreters have applied a variety
of approaches to crack this enigmatic text. Some import exotic
philosophical machinery; others resort to textual emendation. Despite
their efforts, however, most accounts of the text are not clearly
superior to the hypothesis that &ldquo;Indicating&rdquo; never fully
made sense in the first place. The text may well be an ancient
practical joke, one that still ensnares victims today, more than 2000
years after Gongsun Long used it to bewilder audiences. </p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indicating Things&rdquo; discusses the apparently
self-contradictory thesis that &ldquo;When no thing is not indicated,
indicating is not indicating.&rdquo; The interpretive problems begin
with the very structure of the text. It is not clear whether
&ldquo;indicating&rdquo; comprises several arguments for this thesis,
a dialogue between a sophist and an objector, or an argument for the
thesis followed by a refutation. The opening statement, the
paradoxical thesis, appears to be a syntactic contradiction. The
parsing of several lines near the beginning is uncertain. The
motivation for many of the steps in the argument is hard to see. The
key term, <em>zhi,</em> roughly &ldquo;pointing&rdquo; or
&ldquo;indicating,&rdquo; can be rendered as &ldquo;finger,&rdquo;
&ldquo;to point,&rdquo; &ldquo;to refer,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;referent,&rdquo; each of which works well as an English
equivalent in some contexts, but not all. The text slides back and
forth between verbal and nominal uses of <em>zhi,</em> all the while
embedding them in complex strings of quantifiers and negations whose
scope is often vague. On top of these difficulties, from the
reputation associated with Gongsun Long, we should expect the text to
trade in semantic ambiguity and to slip in a category mistake or two,
the more to baffle and entertain the audience. </p>

<p>
The following sample gives a taste of the original, leaving the key
term <em>zhi</em> (indicating, what is indicated) untranslated:</p>

<blockquote>
The world lacking <em>zhi,</em> things cannot be called <em>zhi</em>.

<p>
Not being able to be called <em>zhi</em> is not <em>zhi</em>. </p>

<p>
Not <em>zhi</em> is no thing is not <em>zhi</em>. </p>

<p>
The world lacking <em>zhi</em> and things not being able to be called
<em>zhi</em> is there not being anything that&rsquo;s not
<em>zhi</em>. </p>

<p>
There not being anything that&rsquo;s not <em>zhi</em> is no thing is
not <em>zhi</em>. </p>

<p>
[Therefore] No thing is not <em>zhi</em> is <em>zhi</em> not being
<em>zhi</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The text opens with the claim that &ldquo;No thing is not
<em>zhi,</em> yet <em>zhi</em> is not <em>zhi</em>.&rdquo; Some
interpreters identify <em>zhi</em> with a Western, often Platonic,
philosophical notion such as meaning, class, property, or universal.
The opening claim, for instance, might be rendered &ldquo;Every
particular instantiates a universal, but universals do not instantiate
universals.&rdquo; Such interpretations are unconvincing, however, for
they attempt to make sense of the text by cutting it off from the
intellectual context that provides the content of its terms. Ancient
Chinese theories of language as presented by the Mohists, Xunzi, the
<em>Analects,</em> and <em>The Annals of L&uuml; Buwei</em> employ no
concept corresponding to meaning, property, or universal. Moreover,
they clearly use <em>zhi</em> to mean simply &ldquo;indicate&rdquo; or
&ldquo;refer&rdquo; as a verb and &ldquo;what is indicated&rdquo; or
&ldquo;referent&rdquo; as a noun (cf. Graham 1989: 91, Hansen 1992:
259&ndash;61).</p>

<p>
One interpretation of the thesis consistent with the ancient Chinese
intellectual context is that it concerns a paradoxical feature of
&ldquo;all-inclusive&rdquo; general terms such as &lsquo;things&rsquo;
or &lsquo;the world&rsquo;. The extension of such terms includes
everything there is, so when we use them, &ldquo;no thing is not
pointed to.&rdquo; But precisely because their scope includes
everything, they do not distinguish their referents from anything
else. So &ldquo;indicating is not indicating,&rdquo; since by
referring to everything, such terms fail to point anything out from
anything else. Graham develops an interpretation along roughly these
lines (1989: 91ff.). He proposes, partly on the basis of clues in the
<em>Zhuangzi</em> and <em>Liezi,</em> that &ldquo;Indicating
Things&rdquo; concerns the issue of how the word &lsquo;world&rsquo;
functions as a name. According to Chinese theories of language, names
designate things by distinguishing them from other things. But since
&lsquo;world&rsquo; refers to the whole comprising everything, it
doesn&rsquo;t distinguish anything from other things. Reading the
sample passage quoted above along these lines yields an interpretation
roughly like the following: </p>

<blockquote>
There being no indicating the world, things cannot be called the
indicated.

<p>
Not being able to be called the indicated is not the indicated. </p>

<p>
Not the indicated is no thing is not the indicated. </p>

<p>
There being no indicating the world and things not being able to be
called the indicated is there not being anything that&rsquo;s not the
indicated. </p>

<p>
There not being anything that&rsquo;s not the indicated is no thing is
not the indicated. </p>

<p>
[Therefore] No thing is not the indicated is indicating not being
indicating. </p>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Translation modified from Graham 1989: 92.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We can tentatively understand this as follows. The passage assumes the
claim, previously established, that the world can&rsquo;t be pointed
out from other things, because it is not a thing in itself distinct
from the things that constitute it. The text claims that if the world
can&rsquo;t be indicated in this way, then neither can things. Then it
moves, in obscure steps, from that claim to the paradoxical conclusion
of the last line. Perhaps the point is that when we refer to the
world, we refer to everything: no thing is not indicated. Yet in
referring to the world, we do not distinguish it from anything, so
indicating it is not indicating anything. The steps in the reasoning
are confusing, however, and their justification murky. In the third
line above, for instance, why is &ldquo;not the indicated&rdquo;
considered equivalent to &ldquo;no thing is not the indicated&rdquo;?
One would think it ought to be equivalent to &ldquo;<em>all
things</em> are not the indicated.&rdquo; </p>

<p>
The core theme of Graham&rsquo;s interpretation is plausible, grounded
as it is in the context of ancient Chinese philosophy of language. On
his approach, the text concerns a category mistake: the error of
demanding that, in addition to collectively indicating all the parts
that constitute a whole, we also be able to indicate the whole in
itself, as if it were a thing of the same order as the parts. The
mistake would be parallel to that in Gilbert Ryle&rsquo;s well-known
example of someone being given a campus tour, shown the classrooms,
library, administration building, and dormitories, and then asking to
see the university as well. This interpretive approach explains the
following passage particularly well: </p>

<blockquote>
There being no indicating the world arises from things each having a
name and not being deemed the indicated.

<p>
Though they&rsquo;re not deemed the indicated, we say they&rsquo;re
the indicated; this is collecting together the not deemed the
indicated. </p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s inadmissible to move from there being the not deemed the
indicated to there not being the not deemed the indicated.&hellip;
</p>

<p>
Moreover, indicateds are what the world collects together. </p>

<p>
There being no indicating the world, we can&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s
no indicating things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On a Graham-style interpretation, this passage refutes the paradox
with which the text opens. Each kind of thing has its own name, such
as &lsquo;ox&rsquo; or &lsquo;horse&rsquo;. No distinct thing or kind
of thing is deemed &lsquo;the world&rsquo;. Hence we cannot indicate
the world as distinct from other things. But though no thing in the
world is deemed or named &lsquo;the world&rsquo;&mdash;there is no one
thing or kind of thing specifically indicated by the name &lsquo;the
world&rsquo;&mdash;we nevertheless say that &lsquo;the world&rsquo;
refers to all things. In doing so, we collect together all of the
things in the world and &ldquo;indicate&rdquo; them jointly. So there
are things that are referred to by &lsquo;the world&rsquo; but are not
deemed &lsquo;the world&rsquo;; &lsquo;the world&rsquo; is not their
name, and they are not specifically deemed what is indicated by
&lsquo;the world&rsquo;. But it is illegitimate to claim on that basis
that there&rsquo;s nothing that is not deemed what&rsquo;s indicated
by &lsquo;the world&rsquo;. Rather, &lsquo;the world&rsquo; is the
name of the sum of everything. Moreover, though &lsquo;the
world&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t indicate something distinct from other
things, we can&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s no indicating things. In that
case, the paradox is wrong to claim that &ldquo;indicating is not
indicating.&rdquo; </p>

<p>
Even on this approach, the text remains so full of contradictions,
circular arguments, and logical gaps that it is next to impossible to
interpret the argument with assurance. A satisfactory interpretation
must provide an explanation of the text demonstrably superior to that
of rival readings. While some interpretations of &ldquo;Indicating
Things&rdquo; can be ruled out as inferior to alternatives, so many
uncertainties surround the text that it is difficult to see how any
one reading could be shown to be clearly better than plausible rivals.

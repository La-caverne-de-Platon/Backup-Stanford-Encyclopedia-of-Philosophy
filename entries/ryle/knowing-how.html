<h2>Some Problems in Contemporary Work on Knowing-How and Knowing-That</h2>

<p>
Ryle&rsquo;s work, and in particular his arguments against &ldquo;The
Intellectualist Legend&rdquo;, have garnered a great deal of attention
in the past 20 years by epistemologists. The purpose of this
(necessarily brief) section is to sound a warning about how this work,
insofar as it is attributed to Ryle, has mis-appropriated, if not
misunderstood, him. It ignores (among other things) most of the
arguments in <em>The Concept of Mind</em> and in his <em>Philosophical
Papers</em> about the use of mental conduct concepts, Ryle&rsquo;s
admonition against the &lsquo;cargo-content&rsquo; model of thoughts,
his antipathy toward Propositions or Meanings, and the elasticities of
significance of most, if not all, natural language expressions. The
discussion here presupposes some familiarity with the contemporary
literature, and note, first, that re-framing Ryle&rsquo;s arguments
against the Intellectualist by presupposing mental representations or
content-bearing, causally efficacious mental states surreptitiously
reintroduces the very difficulties the introduction of
&lsquo;know-how&rsquo; was meant to solve. Second, unless they are
used in a special sense (as does Ryle), the English expressions
&lsquo;know-how&rsquo; and &lsquo;know-that&rsquo; cannot be said to
pick out or refer to anything, a fortiori to different &lsquo;states
of knowledge&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
1. It has become commonplace to assume that thinking involves the
grasp of Propositions or &lsquo;propositional content&rsquo; (whatever
that may turn out to be): for what else are the
&lsquo;accusatives&rsquo; of acts of thinking specified by an
indicative sentence in a
 &lsquo;that&rsquo;-clause?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 But in one of his earliest essays, Ryle argues that it is pointless
to construe what is thought or meant as substantial Propositions or
other &ldquo;denizen of the realm of Platonized
&lsquo;that-clauses&rsquo;&rdquo; (Ryle, 1930b, 34). He has several
arguments against these supposed objects of thought, which should be a
concern for any theory of representational ideas: Lockean or
 Fodorian.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 We concentrate here on the regress argument.</p>

<p>
When evaluating Ryle&rsquo;s claim against the Intellectualist that
&ldquo;there are many activities which directly display qualities of
mind which are neither intellectual operations nor yet effects of
intellectual operations&rdquo;, we should ask ourselves, first, what
counts for Ryle as an intellectual operation or its effects.
Calculating, rehearsing lessons one has been taught, following
instructions such as recipes, maps, or other &lsquo;rules&rsquo;,
broadly speaking, are among the examples he uses. But since
calculating, rehearsing lessons, following instructions, commands, or
&lsquo;rules,&rsquo; are themselves achievements, admit of error,
often need correction, and are mastered by practice, skill, or drill
&mdash;in short, they require intelligence&mdash;the
Intellectualist has simply pushed back the problem and not resolved it
by invoking these operations. And merely to push the problem back
without resolving it is tantamount to admitting that the putative
explanation fails.</p>

<p>
But what if these rules are preconscious and their operations tacit or
implicit? If this simply means that we no longer need to rehearse the
lessons we have learned because, as a result of training and practice,
we now know how to act in accordance with them and are on the alert to
correct our errors and those of others, or to justify our actions in
the light of the lessons we have learned, and so on, this would be one
thing. For the following of rules will eventually culminate in knowing
how to act or in acting in accordance with a practice&mdash;&ldquo;I
have been trained to react to this sign in a particular way, and now I
do so react to it&rdquo; (Wittgenstein 1953, &sect;198). That is to
say, having mastered a particular skill (say), we will be able to act
in accordance with instructions (say), without having to go through
the procedure of making sense of them, of understanding how they are
to apply in the present situation, and of succeeding in acting as they
prescribe. But if these successful operations are supposed to occur
via some sort of preconscious &lsquo;mental mechanism&rsquo; or
&lsquo;rational causation&rsquo; then what explains their success is
left mysterious.</p>

<p>
We do not need to go so far as to consider the
&lsquo;operations&rsquo;, for we have the same difficulty accounting
for the success of the posited &lsquo;mental states&rsquo; or (more
recently) &lsquo;states of intelligence&rsquo; which are alleged to
figure in these operations. Consider, for example, the relation
between the &lsquo;mental state&rsquo; and its supposed content. It
does not matter if this is &lsquo;apprehending&rsquo; (Frege, 1956),
&lsquo;latching onto&rsquo; or &lsquo;epistemically engaging
with&rsquo; (see, for example, Bengson and Moffett, 2012), or
&lsquo;entertaining under a particular mode of presentation&rsquo;
(Stanley and Williamson 2001), and so on. We still must ask whether
the (alleged) content is &lsquo;apprehended&rsquo;, &lsquo;engaged
with&rsquo;, &lsquo;latched onto&rsquo;, or &lsquo;entertained&rsquo;
properly, reasonably, or &lsquo;under the correct mode&rsquo;.
Attempting to conceal or halt the regress at any point once these
entities and their operations are introduced&mdash;by, for example,
suggesting that an &lsquo;intelligent state&rsquo; is
&lsquo;triggered&rsquo;, &lsquo;deployed&rsquo;, &lsquo;applied&rsquo;
or &lsquo;utilized&rsquo; <em>appropriately</em> but not intelligently
(see Bengson &amp; Moffett, 29 ), or that &ldquo;behavior can be
<em>informed</em> in a non-deliberative way by propositional attitude
states&rdquo; (Stanley, 2011b, 19, italics added)&mdash;even if this
strategy made sense&mdash;invites the question why these theoretical
posits and their operations are needed in the first place when they
fail to explain what they were introduced to explain. But this
strategy does not make sense. The merit of understanding propositions
as grammarians do, as statements, inscriptions, or what we
&ldquo;think and talk <em>in</em>&rdquo; (Ryle, 1930b, 39), is that we
can specify what would count in particular circumstances as following
a rule or acting in accordance with it, and, most importantly, what
would count as evidence either way. In any case, once the
(undiscoverable) supposed rational process is mechanized, we should
wonder whether our subject matter really is that of thinking. For,
daydreams presumably aside, &ldquo;[thought] is not something that
just happens to us and in us, like digestion. It is something that we
do, and do well or badly, carefully or carelessly, expertly or
amateurishly.&rdquo; Ryle (1965,
 161)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
In sum, Ryle does indeed deny that intelligence requires the
apprehension of truths, that it requires specific internal acts, and
that practical activities merit the description
&lsquo;intelligent&rsquo;, &lsquo;clever&rsquo;, and so on only
because they are accompanied by some such ostensibly internal acts.
But this cannot be reinterpreted on Ryle&rsquo;s behalf as an argument
against the view that &ldquo;internal, non-overt, mental states of
grasping propositions are&hellip; to make the difference between the
Intelligent and the non-Intelligent&rdquo; (Bengson and Moffett, 2012,
 6&ndash;7).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 The dispute between the Intellectualist and his adversaries cannot
invoke propositional attitude states or mental representations without
begging the question against Ryle at the outset.</p>

<p>
2. Ryle puts his regress argument in a memorable way by saying that
knowing-how is logically prior to knowing-that, making clear in the
context what he means by &lsquo;knowledge-that&rsquo; (viz. the
consideration of regulative propositions, such as recipes or other
instructions, in order to guide one&rsquo;s actions) and
&lsquo;knowledge-how&rsquo; (viz. the ability to act intelligently
without consideration of such maxims.) But these catchy phrases have
been reintroduced in contemporary debates as &ldquo;two types of
knowledge&rdquo; and great energy is expended attempting to glean how
they, together with knowledge-when, where, what, etc., are used in
snippets of ordinary discourse in order to theorize about
&lsquo;nature&rsquo; of these types of knowledge&mdash;that which
the expressions are alleged to pick out.</p>

<p>
But these, like most natural language expressions, are not names: they
do not pick out or refer to anything. They are more akin to tools,
employed for various purposes, with different situation-dependent
inflections of meaning and, indeed, interchangeable in many contexts.
My puppy, Rasteau, has learned, within a few days, to sit and stay
when commanded. Does he know that he should sit down when commanded?
But is that not what I just said&mdash;in other words? Does he know
how to sit down when commanded? Yes; did I not say so&mdash;using a
slightly different expression? Should I attribute to him two kinds of
knowledge? The dog?? Yet this ordinary, unremarkable
interchangeability of expressions is taken by philosophers to show
that &lsquo;factual&rsquo; knowledge&mdash;understood as the grasp
of true propositions&mdash;accompanies, or is prior to, abilities
acquired by training and drill. Nobody would think, however, to
attribute to Rasteau the apprehension of a &lsquo;proposition&rsquo;
or &lsquo;truth&rsquo;. Why should this be different for my husband,
John? How would the apprehension of a truth, or the grasp of a
proposition add to, explain, or elucidate my claim that John knows,
for example, how to clean up after the dog? Or that it is his turn?
John, unlike Rasteau, has the ability to learn by following diagrams,
symbols, propositions written down in books or the instructions I
give, and later to teach, and to justify, if needed, the moves he
makes in his cleaning-up-after-the-dog practice. Rasteau can 
follow&mdash;through training, drill, reward, and correction&mdash;simple
commands. Eventually, it is to be hoped, the dog (perhaps even the
husband) will engage in these respective behaviors automatically. In
Ryle&rsquo;s technical sense, Rasteau will know how to behave
properly. But no one should doubt that Rasteau knows both how to sit
and that he should sit when I so command. In natural language, in this
context, these say the same thing. Thus, when Ryle contrasts
&lsquo;knowledge-that&rsquo; and &lsquo;knowledge-how&rsquo; he
employs the expressions in a technical sense: specially tailored for
the particular view he wishes to rebut: viz., that intelligence
requires the apprehension of truths, or effects of operations upon
them. Attempting to chart the way the expressions figure in ordinary
discourse, without acknowledging Ryle&rsquo;s introduction of a
special, technical context when he employs them will get us
 nowhere.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 No wonder there is no agreement as to which is logically prior:
unless a special use is introduced, they are often ways of saying the
same thing.</p>

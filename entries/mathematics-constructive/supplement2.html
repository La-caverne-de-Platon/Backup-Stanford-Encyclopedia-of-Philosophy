<h2>Approaches to Constructive Topology</h2>

<p>
One of the basic results of classical point set topology is the
Heine-Borel theorem (HBT): if a set of open intervals covers the
closed unit interval [0,1], then already finitely many of them cover
the interval; in other words, [0,1] is <em>open-cover
compact</em>. Within INT the theorem is still valid by an appeal to
the full fan theorem (Dummett [2000]). Moerdijk [1984] has shown that
HBT is strictly weaker than the full fan theorem, but we do not know
of any natural fan theorem to which the Heine-Borel theorem is
equivalent relative to BISH. HBT is one example of how fan theorems
facilitate the development of topology within INT; see also Troelstra
[1978] and Waaldijk [1996]. However the effectivity of HBT can be called
into question, as within RUSS the existence of \(\varepsilon\)-singular
covers (see Section 3.2 above) provides a strong recursive
counterexample to the theorem.</p>

<p>
In his practice of analysis, Bishop [1967] took a radical approach by limiting his attention to
metric spaces, in which compactness can be defined as completeness
plus total boundedness. Moreover, he took the continuity of a function
from a compact metric space into a metric space to mean uniform
continuity, by definition. This allowed him to regain most of the
useful theorems about, for example, suprema and positive measures,
without referring to HBT. It is possible to generalise his theory to
uniform spaces, but for some applications this is clearly not
sufficient: for instance, quotient spaces of uniform spaces need not
be uniform spaces, a fact that bars direct applicability to fields
such as algebraic topology.</p>

<p> However, almost in passing, Bishop [1967] mentions two possible
approaches to the constructive development of topology: neighbourhood
spaces and function spaces. Little appears to have been done in the
former topic, but Petrakis [2016, 2016a] has made considerable
progress in the latter. The two are linked in an interesting article
of Ishihara [2013].</p>

<p>
The neighborhood structure on a topological space tells us only when
points are close, but in general gives little information about the
more global structure of the space. In order to go significantly
beyond metric and uniform spaces, we need to consider topological
spaces endowed with some not-necessarily-uniform structure over and
above the neighbourhood one. One such endowment is the function space
structure mentioned in the preceding paragraph. We now describe two
alternative approaches: apartness spaces, where the fundamental axioms
capture the idea of subspaces being apart from one another; and
point-free topology, where the notion of open sets and their mutual
cover relations are taken as basics.</p>

<h3>Apartness spaces</h3>

<p> A classical theory of proximity spaces, based on the primitive
notion of two sets being near each other, has been around for over 100
years and has been developed substantially over the last 60 or so; see
Riesz [1908], Naimpally &amp; Warrack [1970], and Naimpally [2009]. It
soon becomes clear, however, that the notion&mdash;a negative one,
logically speaking&mdash;of nearness does not have much computational
strength, and that, in some constructive form, its classical
obverse&mdash;apartness&mdash;is what one needs for a constructively
fruitful theory. We sketch such a theory based on a few axioms
specifying the fundamental properties of the notion of apartness (a)
between a point and a set, and (b) between two sets.</p>

<p>
Let \(X\) be an inhabited set equipped with an inequality
relation \(\ne\) : that is, a binary relation on \(X\) that
satisfies these two properties for all \(x, y \in X\) :</p>

\[\begin{align*}
x \ne y &amp;\Rightarrow \neg(y \ne x), \\
x \ne y &amp;\Rightarrow y \ne x.
\end{align*}\]

<p>
Note that, in general, this inequality relation will be distinct from
the special case of the denial inequality, in which the first
implication in the preceding display is replaced by a
bi-implication. This distinction gives rise to two types
of complement for subsets \(S\) of \(X\):</p>

<ul>
<li>the <em>logical complement</em>, \(\neg S \equiv \{x \in X : \neg(x \in S)\}\);</li>
<li>the <em>complement</em>, \({\sim}S \equiv \{x \in X : \forall s \in S (x \ne s)\}\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
We also equip \(X\) with a binary relation \(\bowtie\) between points
and subsets of \(X\). This brings into play a third type of
complement:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <em>apartness complement</em>, \({-}S \equiv \{x \in X : x \bowtie S\}\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
It will follow from the axioms for \(\bowtie\) that \({-}S \subset{\sim}S \subset \neg S\).</p>

<p>
If \(\bowtie\) satisfies the following axioms (in which, for
simplicity, we omit the quantifiers), then it is called a
(<em>point-set</em>) <em>pre-apartness</em> on \(X\), and \(X\), taken
with \(\bowtie\), becomes a (<em>point-set</em>) <em>pre-apartness
space</em>:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\tag{A1} &amp;x \bowtie \varnothing \\
\tag{A2} &amp;{-}A \subset{\sim}S \\
\tag{A3} &amp;x \bowtie(A \cup B) \leftrightarrow(x \bowtie A \wedge x \bowtie B) \\
\tag{A4} &amp;{-}A \subset{\sim}B \Rightarrow -A \subset -B
\end{align}\]

<p>
If, in addition to A1&ndash;A4, the pre-apartness satisfies</p>

\[
\tag{A5} x \bowtie A \Rightarrow \forall y \in X (x \ne y \vee y \bowtie A),
\]

<p>
then we call it an <em>apartness</em>, and the space X a (point-set)
apartness space. The value of the additional axiom A5 is that it
provides us with alternatives that hold automatically in CLASS and
that facilitate many constructive proofs. Nevertheless, it makes good
sense to work without A5 where it is not needed.</p>

<p>
The canonical example of an apartness space is an inhabited metric
space \((X,\varrho)\), taken with the metric inequality defined
by</p>

\[
x \ne y \Leftrightarrow \varrho(x, y) \gt 0
\]

<p>
and with</p>

\[
x \bowtie S \Leftrightarrow \exists r \gt 0\,\forall s \in S\, (\varrho(x, s) \ge r).
\]

<p> 

The real line \(\mathbf{R}\) with its standard metric is such an apartness
space. However, if we take the real line with the denial inequality,
rather than metric one, then axiom A5 holds if and only if we adopt
Markov&rsquo;s principle; so in the absence of the latter, the resulting
space is only a pre-apartness one.</p>

<p>
For the rest of this section only, we adopt the convention that a
topological space \(X\) comes with an inequality relation
\(\ne\). The topology \(\tau\) then induces a topological pre-apartness
\(\bowtie_{\tau}\) on \(X\), defined by</p>

\[
x \bowtie_{\tau} S \Leftrightarrow x \in({\sim}S)^{\circ},
\]

<p>where, as usual, \(^{\circ}\) denotes interior. If
\(X\) has the <em>topological A5 property</em>,</p>

\[
\forall x \in X\, \forall U \in \tau\, 
 (x \in U \Rightarrow \forall y \in X\, 
 (x \ne y \vee y \in U)),
\]


<p>then the corresponding pre-apartness is an apartness. Note that on
a metric apartness space the apartness corresponding to the metric
topology coincides with the metric apartness. 
</p>

<p>
Every pre-apartness
\(\bowtie\) on an inhabited set induces a natural apartness topology
\(\tau_{\bowtie}\), in which the <em>nearly open sets</em> are the
unions of families of apartness complements. In turn,
\(\tau_{\bowtie}\) induces on \(X\) a pre-apartness, which turns out
to be the original one. If the pre-apartness \(\bowtie\) is induced by
a topology \(\tau\) on \(X\), then every nearly open subset of \(X\)
is \(\tau\)-open. When the converse holds, so that the apartness
topology and the original one coincide, we say that the topological
space \(X\) is <em>topologically consistent</em>. Topological
consistency always holds classically, but need not hold
constructively. One condition on \(X\) that ensures its topological
consistency is that of <em>topological local decomposability</em>:</p>

\[
\forall x \in X\, \forall U \in \tau\,
  (x \in U \Rightarrow \exists V \in \tau\,
  (x \in V \wedge X = U \cup{\sim}V).
\]

<p>
If we start with a pre-apartness \(\bowtie\) on a set \(X\), then we
can define a counterpart of this last condition&mdash;<em>local
decomposability</em>:</p>

\[
\forall x \in X\, \forall S \subset X\, 
 (x \in {-}S \Rightarrow \exists T \subset X\, 
 (x \in {-}T \wedge X = {-}S \cup T)).
\]

<p>
It turns out that a topological space \((X, \tau)\) is topologically
locally decomposable if and only if it is topologically consistent and
\((X, \bowtie_{\tau})\) is locally decomposable.</p>

<p> One obvious way to introduce continuity of a mapping \(f : (X,
\bowtie_X) \rightarrow(Y, \bowtie_Y)\) between pre-apartness spaces is
to work with the corresponding apartness topologies. Thus we say that
\(f\) is <em>topologically continuous</em> if for each nearly open
subset \(V\) of \(Y, f^{-1}(V)\) is nearly open in \(X\). But there is
a notion of continuity that is more in the morphic spirit of category
theory: we say that \(f\) is <em>apartness continuous</em> if for all
\(x \in X\) and \(S \subset X\),</p>

\[
f(x) \bowtie_Y f(S) \Rightarrow x \bowtie_X S.
\]

<p>
If \(X\) and \(Y\) are metric spaces, then the apartness continuity of
\(f\) is equivalent to continuity in the usual
\(\varepsilon\)-\(\delta\) sense.</p>

<p>
The really hard work, with significant rewards, in the theory of
apartness comes when we lift our attention to pre-apartness between
subsets of an inhabited set \(X\). For this, we require the
(set-set) pre-apartness \(\bowtie\) to satisfy the following axioms:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\tag{B1} &amp;X \bowtie \varnothing \\
\tag{B2} &amp;{-}A \subset{\sim}A \\
\tag{B3} &amp;(A_1 \cup A_2) \Leftrightarrow(B_1 \cup B_2) \not\Leftrightarrow \forall i, j \in \{1, 2\} (A_i \bowtie B_j) \\
\tag{B4} &amp;{-}A \subset{\sim}B \Rightarrow {-}A \subset {-}B.
\end{align}\]

<p>
(The rather complicated form of axiom B3 enables us to work without
assuming the symmetry of \(\bowtie\).)</p>

<p>
As the reader will have surmised, in axioms B2 and B4, \({-}A\) is the
apartness complement of \(A\) relative to the point-set relation
defined by
</p>

\[
x \bowtie A \Leftrightarrow \{x\} \bowtie A,
\]

<p>
which is a point-set pre-apartness said to be <em>associated
with</em>, or <em>induced by</em>, the set-set relation \(\bowtie.\)</p>

<p>
If axioms B1&ndash;B4 hold, then the pair \((X, \bowtie)\), or when no
confusion is likely, the set \(X\) itself, a
(<em>set-set</em>) <em>pre-apartness space</em>; and if \(A \bowtie
B\), we say that \(A\) is <em>apart from B</em>. By a
(<em>set-set</em>) <em>apartness</em> on \(X\) we mean a relation
\(\bowtie\) between subsets of \(X\) that satisfies axioms B1&ndash;B3
and
</p>

\[
\tag{B5} x \in A \Rightarrow \exists S \subset X (x \in {-}S \wedge X = {-}A \cup S).
\]

<p>
The relation \(\bowtie\) then also satisfies B4 and so is a
pre-apartness. Regarded as a point-set pre-apartness space, \(X\)
is then locally decomposable (this is precisely what B5 says) and
hence satisfies A5. In this case we call \((X, \bowtie)\), or
simply \(X\) itself, a (<em>set-set</em>) <em>apartness
space</em>.</p>

<p>
The canonical example of a set-set apartness is again a metric space
\((X, \varrho)\), in which we define the <em>metric apartness</em>
by</p>

\[
A \bowtie B \Leftrightarrow \exists r \gt 0\,
\forall x \in A\, \forall y \in B\,
(\varrho(x, y) \gt r).
\]

<p>
A more general example is a uniform
space, whose definition we pass over here.</p>

<p>
The natural morphisms in the category of set-set pre-apartness spaces
are the functions \(f : (X, \bowtie_X) \rightarrow (Y, \bowtie_Y)\)
that are <em>strongly continuous</em>,in the sense that for all \(A, B
\subset X\),</p>

\[
f(A) \bowtie_Y f(B) \Rightarrow A \bowtie_X B.
\]
 
<p>
Every uniformly continuous mapping between metric spaces is strongly
continuous. Among other results connecting types of continuity for a
mapping \(f : X \rightarrow Y\) between metric spaces we have
these:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(f\) is uniformly continuous if and only if the mapping \(f
\times f : (x, x') \rightsquigarrow (f(x), f(x'))\) is strongly
continuous on the product metric space \(X \times X\).</li>

<li>If \(f\) is strongly continuous, then it is uniformly sequentially
continuous.</li>

<li>If \(f\) is strongly continuous and \(f(X)\) is totally bounded,
then \(f\) is uniformly continuous.</li>

<li>If \(X\) is totally bounded and \(f\) is strongly continuous, then
\(f\) is uniformly continuous.</li>

</ul>

<p>
The proofs of the second and fourth of these results are particularly
involved, and introduce a proof technique that has other applications,
for example in the theory of convergence of sequences of functions
between apartness spaces. Note that we cannot pass, in general, from
uniform sequential continuity to uniform continuity without using
\(\BDN\).</p>

<p>
We refer the reader to Chapter 3 of Bridges &amp; V&icirc;&#539;&#259;
[2011] for more information, including an extensive bibliography, about
set-set apartness relations.</p>

<h3>Point-free topology</h3>

<p>
In point-free topology the ideal objects (points) \(X\) are taken as
basic and we group them together in ever narrower so-called <em>open
sets</em>. The set \(O(X)\) of open sets defines the topology, and is
required to be closed under arbitrary unions and finite
intersections. The open sets are often described in terms of basic
open sets, so that every open set may be written as a union of such
sets. These basic open sets can be thought of as approximations to the
points. To give a specific example, the topology of the real line
\(\bR\) may be described in terms of the basic open sets </p>

\[
(p, q) = \{x \in \bR : p \lt x \lt q \}
\]

<p>
where \(p\) and \(q\) are rational numbers. Each such basic
open, an interval with rational endpoints, is specified by finite
information and approximates all the real numbers \(x\) in the
interval. </p>

<p>
We may try to reverse the order of concepts, and take the basic opens,
or approximations, as fundamental, and derive the ideal objects or
points from the opens and their mutual relations. This is what is done
in point-free topology, a field which has a long history going back to
Wallman [1938], Menger [1940] and in its current form, Ehresmann &amp;
Isbell; see Picardo &amp; Pultr [2011]. There is also a precursor in
point-free geometry (Whitehead [1919]). We shall here concentrate
on <em>formal topology</em> (Sambin [1987]), which is a version of <em>
locale theory</em> (Johnstone [1982], Joyal &amp; Tierney [1984], Picardo
&amp; Pultr [2011]), where special consideration has been given to issues
of constructivity and predicativity. Some seminal examples in formal
topology were developed earlier in Martin-L&ouml;f [1970].
</p>

<p>
A <em>formal topology</em> is a triple \(\langle A, \le,
\cov \rangle\) consisting of a set \(A\) of basic opens, a
transitive and reflexive relation \(\le\) on \(A\), and a relation cov
between elements of \(A\) and subsets of \(A\). The relation \(a \le
b\) is understood as (formal) inclusion, whereas \(a\) cov \(U\) is
read \(a\) is covered by \(U\). These are supposed to satisfy the
following natural axioms.</p>

<ul>

<li> \(\mathbf{ER}\) (extension and reflexity): \(a \cov U\), whenever
\(a \le b\) for some \(b \in U\) </li>

<li> \(\mathbf{T}\) (transitivity): \(a \cov V\),
whenever \(a \cov U\), and for each \(b \in U\), \(b \cov V\) </li>

<li> \(\mathbf{L}\) (localization): If \(b \cov U\) and \(a \le b\),
then \(a \cov a \downarrow U\), where

\[
a \downarrow U \equiv \{x \in A : x \le a \wedge \exists y \in U (x \le y\}).
\]
</li>

</ul>

<p>
A <em>point</em> in this topology is an inhabited subset \(\alpha\) of
basic opens which satisfies these conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li> \(\mathbf{F}\) (filtering): If \(a, b \in \alpha\), then there
exists \(c \in \alpha\) with \(c \le a\) and \(c \le b\).</li>

<li> \(\mathbf{S}\) (splitting): If \(a \in \alpha\) and \(a \cov
U\), then for some \(b \in U, b \in \alpha\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
We think of a point as a set of approximations. The filtering property
insures that any two approximations have a common refinement, whereas
the splitting property allows an approximation to be refined in any
way the cover relation allows.</p>

<p>
For any set \(U \subseteq A\), we let \(U^*\) be the set of all points
\(\alpha\) where \(a \in U\) for some \(a \in \alpha\). It can be
shown that the points together with the sets \(U^*\) form a point-set
topology in the usual sense, and that formal cover implies point-wise
cover: </p>

\[
a \cov U \Rightarrow \{a\}^* \subseteq U^*.
\]
 
<p> The converse implication usually fails. </p>

<p>
For any \(S \subseteq A\), we may define an associated closed subspace
of \(\bA \equiv\langle A, \le, \cov\rangle\) by redefining the cover relation:</p>

\[
a \covs U \equiv a \cov S \cup U.
\]

<p>
Note that if \(a \cov S\), then \(a \covs \varnothing\), so, in
effect, the open set determined by \(S\), gets identified with the
empty set, as far as mutual covering goes. The topology</p>

\[
\mathbf{A}\text{-}S \equiv \langle A, \le, \covs\rangle
\]

<p>
represents the subspace corresponding to the points not
in \(S\). </p>


<p>To illustrate the methods of formal topology, we give a proof of
the point-free <em>Heine-Borel theorem</em>:</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\mathbf{HBT}\) <em>Every cover of the unit interval by open
sets has a finitely enumerable subcover.</em>
</p>

<p>

Note the use of &ldquo;finitely enumerable&rdquo; here. A set \(S\) is
called <em>finitely enumerable</em> if there exist a positive integer
\(N\) and a mapping \(f\) of \(\{1, \ldots ,N\}\) onto \(S\). If the
mapping \(f\) is one-one, then we say that \(S\)
is <em>finite</em>. If the pairset \(\{0, x\}\) is finite, then we can
decide whether \(x\) equals 0 or not. Thus (see Section 1 above), the
statement &ldquo;every finitely enumerable subset of \(\bR\) is
finite&rdquo; implies LPO.
</p>

<p>
To prove HBT, we need to construct the point-free reals. Accordingly,
let \(\bR \equiv\langle I, \le_I, \cov\rangle\) be the formal topology given
by the following data: \(I\) is the set of pairs \((p, q)\) where</p>

<ul>
<li>\(p \lt q\) are rational numbers, and</li>

<li> such pairs are ordered by setting \((p', q') \le_I (p, q)\) if
and only if \(p \le p'\) and \(q' \le q\).
</li>
</ul>

<p>A pair in \(I\) is regarded as specifying an interval with
rational end points. The cover relation \(\cov\) is the smallest cover
relation that satisfies the following axioms:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\tag{R1} &amp;\text{for } p \lt p' \lt q' \lt q, (p, q) \cov \{(p, q'),(p', q)\} \\
\tag{R2} &amp;\text{for } p \lt q, (p, q) \cov \{(p', q') : p \lt p' \lt q' \lt q\}
\end{align}\]

<p>
These axioms describe two principal ways of covering an interval by
shorter intervals. The points of \(\bR\) are the <em>real
numbers</em>. We define the order of the points by taking \(\alpha \lt
\beta\) if and only if there exist \((p, q) \in \alpha\) and \((p',
q') \in \beta\) with \(q \lt p'\); we then take \(\beta \le \alpha\)
to mean that \(\alpha \lt \beta\) is false. It is possible to show
using transfinite induction on covers (cf. Coquand <em>et al.</em>
2003) that we have the following alternative characterisation of the
above cover relation: </p>

<p class="indent">
\((p, q)\) cov \(U\) holds if and only if for
any \(r \lt s\) with \(p \lt r \lt s \lt q\), there exist
\(t_1 \lt t_2 \lt \ldots \lt t_n, n \ge 3\),
with \(r = t_1, s = t_n\), such that each
\((t_i, t_{i+2}) (1\le i \le n - 2)\) is included in some interval
of \(U\) (Cederquist &amp; Negri [1996]).
</p>

<p>
Let</p>

\[
S \equiv \{(p, q) \in I : q \lt 0\} \cup \{(p, q) \in I : 1 \lt p\}.
\]


<p>

It can be 
shown that the points of \(\mathbf{R}\text{-}S\) are 
the real numbers in the interval [0, 1].</p>

<p>

We now have the ingredients to prove HBT. To say that \(U\) covers the
unit interval \(\mathbf{R}\text{-}S\) means that \((p, q) \covs U\)
for all \((p, q)\). In particular \((-2, 3) \covs U\); that is, \((-2,
3) \cov S \cup U\). Hence for \(r = -1 \lt s = 2\) there are \(t_1 \lt
t_2 \lt \ldots \lt t_n\) with \(r = t_1\) and \(s = t_n\), such that
each \((t_i, t_{i+2}) (1 \le i \le n-2)\) is included in some interval
of \(S \cup U\). Thus for \(i = 1, \ldots ,n - 2\), there exists
\((p_i, q_i) \in S \cup U\) with \((t_i, t_{i+2}) \le(p_i, q_i)\). It
follows that there is a finitely enumerable \(F \subset U\) such that
\((-1, 2) \covs F\). But \((p, q) \covs (-1, 2)\) for all \((p, q) \in
I\), so by transitivity, \((p, q) \covs F\). Hence \(F\) is a finitely
enumerable subcover of the unit interval. This establishes the
theorem. </p>

<p>
Another surprising result about compactness is that Tychonoff&rsquo;s
theorem holds for formal topologies (Coquand [1992]). In classical
point-set topology this theorem is equivalent to the Axiom of Choice
(Johnstone [1982]). Moreover, the classically highly non-constructive
Stone-&#268;ech compactification has as well a constructive point-free
version (Curi [2010]). </p>

<p>
The category of (set-presented) formal topologies has good properties
from a topological point of view: it has (finite) limits and (finite)
colimits. In particular, it is possible to construct quotient spaces
and to attach subspaces, so the category seems adequate for doing
algebraic topology; see Palmgren [2009].</p>



<p>
Many results in functional analysis have natural point-free proofs
(Johnstone [1982], Picardo &amp; Pultr [2011]); some of them&mdash;for
instance, the Riesz representation theorem (Coquand &amp; Spitters
[2009])&mdash;can also be proved completely constructively. There are,
in addition, methods for dealing with the Zariski topology and spectra
of rings in a point-free way (Johnstone [1982]); here, too, it is
possible to make constructive developments (Schuster [2006], Coquand
[2009]). </p>

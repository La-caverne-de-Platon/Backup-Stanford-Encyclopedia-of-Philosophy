<div id="preamble">

<p>
In light of logic&rsquo;s historical roots in dialogue and
argumentation, games and logic are a natural fit. Argumentation is a
game-like activity that involves taking turns, saying the right things
at the right time, and, in competitive settings, has clear pay-offs in
terms of winning and losing. Pursuing this connection, specialized
logic games have already been used in the middle ages as a tool for
logic training <span class="citation">(Hamblin 1970)</span>. The
modern area augmented this picture with formal dialogue games as
foundation for logic, relating winning strategies in argumentation to
cogent proofs <span class="citation">(Kamlah 1973 [1984])</span>.
Today, connections between logic and game theory span across a great
number of different strands, involving the interface with game theory,
but also linguistics, computer science, and further fields.</p>

<div id="main-text">

<h2 id="Over">1. Overview</h2>

<p>
The present entry provides a comprehensive survey of logics for
analyzing games, arranged under a number of unifying themes and
perspectives. Also, occasional connections are made with other strands
at the interface of logic and games covered elsewhere in this
Encyclopedia. This overview section is a brief <em>tour
d&rsquo;horizon</em> for topics that will return in more detail later
on.</p>

<div id="exIntro">

<h3 id="LogiGame">1.1 Logic of Games</h3>

<p>
Specific games stand for significant recurrent patterns of social
interaction. In a perspective called &lsquo;logic of games&rsquo;,
notions and results from logic are used to analyze the structure of
various games. In fact, much classic reasoning about games involves
notions that are familiar from logic.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Game solution reasoning.</p>

<p>
Consider the following game tree for two players <i>A</i>, <i>E</i>,
with turns marked, and with pay-offs written with the value for
<i>A</i> first. Alternatively, these values can be interpreted as
encoding players&rsquo; qualitative (or ordinal) preferences between
outcomes.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig1">
<img src="fig1.svg" alt="This is a game tree diagram illustrating what is described in the paragraph following the figure. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1.</span> 
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig1" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
Here is how players might reason. At her turn, <i>E</i> faces a
standard decision problem, with two available actions and the outcome
of action <em>left</em> better for her than that of <em>right</em>. So
she will choose left. Knowing this, <i>A</i> expects that his choosing
<em>right</em> will give him outcome 0, while going <em>left</em>
gives him outcome 1, so he chooses left. As a result, both players are
worse off than they would have been, had they played
<em>right</em>/<em>right</em>. The reasoning in this scenario, in
short, leads to an outcome that is not Pareto-optimal.</p>

<p>
The example raises the question just why players should act this way,
and whether, say, a more cooperative behavior could also be justified.
An answer obviously depends on the players&rsquo; information and
style of reasoning. Here it becomes of interest to probe the structure
of the example. Looking more closely, many notions are involved in the
above scenario: actions and their results, players knowledge about the
structure of the game, their preferences about its results, but also
how they believe the game will proceed. There are even counterfactual
conditionals in the background, such as <i>A</i>&rsquo;s explaining
his choice afterwards by saying that &ldquo;if I had played
<em>right</em>, <i>E</i> would have played <em>left</em>&rdquo;.
These notions, moreover, are entangled in subtle ways. For instance,
<i>A</i> does not choose <em>left</em> because it dominates
<em>right</em> in the standard sense of always being better for him,
but rather because <em>left</em> dominates <em>right</em> according to
his beliefs. How these beliefs are formed, in turn, depends on many
other features of the game, including the nature of the players.</p>

<p>
In short, even a very simple game like the one discussed brings
together large parts of the agenda of philosophical logic in one very
concrete setting. This entry will zoom in on the aspects mentioned
here, with
 <a href="#natplayers">Section 3</a>
 dedicated to players&rsquo; preferences and beliefs, while
 <a href="#section:play">Section 4</a>
 addresses reasoning styles and the dynamics of attitudes as the game
proceeds.</p>

<p>
The analysis is structured by a few broad distinctions. Intuitively,
games involve several phases that involve logic in different ways:
deliberation prior to the game, as many game-theoretic solution
concepts are in fact deliberation procedures that create initial
expectations about how a game will go on. Observation and belief
revision during game play, including reactions to deviations from
prior expectations. And finally, post-game analysis, say, to settle
what can be learnt from a defeat, or to engage in spin about
one&rsquo;s performance. Moreover all this can be considered in two
modes, assuming either a first-person participant or a third-person
observer view of games and play.</p>
</div>





<h3 id="LogiGameTheo">1.2 Logic and Game Theory</h3>

<p>
In many of the above topics, logics meets game theory. One such
interface area is
 <a href="../epistemic-game/index.html">epistemic game theory</a>
 where game play and solution concepts are analyzed and justified in
light of various assumptions about players and their epistemic states,
such as common knowledge or common belief in rationality. Epistemic
game theory may be viewed as a joint offspring of logic and game
theory, a form of progeny which constitutes a reliable sign of success
of an interdisciplinary contact.</p>

<p>
There are also other viable logical perspectives. In particular, one
can look at game theory the way mathematical logicians look at any
branch of mathematics. Following the style of the famous Erlangen
Program, one can discuss the structures studied in that field and look
for structural invariance relations and matching logical languages.
Game theory is rich in structure, as it has several different natural
notions of invariance. The tree format of extensive games offers a
detailed view of what happens step by step as players make their
moves, whereas the matrix format of strategic form games offers a
high-level view that centers on outcomes. Yet other formats, to be
discussed below, focus on players&rsquo; control over the various
outcomes. All these different levels of game structure come with their
own logical systems, as will be detailed in
 <a href="#gamestructures">Section 2</a>.
 Moreover, these different logics do not just provide isolated
snapshots: they can be related in a systematic manner.</p>

<p>
In this way, the usual logical techniques can be brought to bear. For
instance, formal languages can express basic properties of games,
while model-checking techniques can determine efficiently whether
these hold in given concrete games <span class="citation">(cf. Clarke,
Grumberg, &amp; Peled 1999)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Winning strategies.</p>

<p>
Consider the following game tree, with move relations for both
players, and propositional letters \(\win_{i}\) marking winning
positions for player <i>i</i>.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig2">
<img src="fig2.svg" alt="A game tree with extended description in the link in the caption below" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 2.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig2" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
Clearly, player <i>E</i> has a winning strategy against player
<i>A</i>, i.e., a recipe that guarantees her to win, no matter what
<i>A</i> does. This is expressed by a modal formula capturing exactly
the right dynamics:</p> 

\[[\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle \win_E\]

<p>
Here \([\move_A]\) is the universal modality &ldquo;for all moves by
player <i>A</i>", and \(\langle \move_E\rangle\) is the existential
modality &ldquo;for some move by player <i>E</i>". This two-step
modality- or quantifier-based response pattern is typical for
strategic powers of players in arbitrary games, as it captures the
essence of sequential interaction. Crucially, logical laws can acquire
game-theoretic import. For instance, the law of Excluded Middle
applied to the above formula yields:</p> 

\[{[\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle \win_E} \lor {\neg[\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle \win_E}\]

<p>
or in a logically equivalent formulation:</p> 

\[ {[\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle \win_E} \lor {\langle \move_A\rangle [\move_E]\neg \win_E}\]

<p>
In two-step games like the above, where exactly one player wins (i.e.,
\(\win_A\leftrightarrow\neg\win_E\)), the latter formula expresses
that either player <i>E</i> or player <i>A</i> has a winning strategy.
More generally, this disjunctive assertion is a special case of
Zermelo&rsquo;s theorem, stating that every finite full information
game is determined.</p>

<p>
Having established the connection to logical languages, further
model-theoretic themes can be applied fruitfully to games. Language
based reasoning allows, for instance, to examine the preservation of
properties between different games, based on the exact syntactic shape
of their definition. Besides, logical syntax also supports logical
proof theory. Hence, the latter&rsquo;s rich pool of proof calculi may
help to analyze basic results in game theory. This entry illustrates
major recurring patterns of reasoning about interaction that come to
light in this way.</p>

<p>
Game theory also has a further natural level of representation,
suppressing details of local moves and choices. The most familiar
format for this are games in <em>strategic form</em>. In the simplest
case of only two players, these correspond to a two-dimensional
matrix, with rows standing for some player&rsquo;s strategies, and
columns for the other&rsquo;s. Individual cells of such matrix hence
correspond to the different possible <em>strategy profiles</em> of the
game. Typically, all cells are labeled with information about the
<em>outcomes</em> resulting from playing the corresponding strategies
against one another. This labeling specifies players&rsquo; attitudes
to outcome in terms of pay-offs, more abstract utilities, or ordinal 
markers for players&rsquo; preferences orders among outcomes.</p>

<p>
Strategic form games, too, can model significant social scenarios.
Here is an illustration from the philosophical literature on the
evolution of social behavior.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> The following game in matrix
form is the <em>Stag Hunt</em> of <span class="citation">Skyrms
(2003)</span>, going back to ideas of David Hume. It serves as a
metaphor for the social contract.</p>

<p>
Each agent must decide between pursuing their own little project,
hunting a hare, or joining in a larger collective endeavor, hunting
stag. The former gives a moderate but guaranteed income, no matter
what others do. The collective endeavor, on the other hand, can only
succeed if all contribute, in which case everybody receives a high
profit. If, however, some do not join, all contributions are lost and
no contributor receives anything. In the corresponding strategic form
game, all players have to decide on what to do in parallel, without
knowing the actions of others.</p>

<p>
The Stag Hunt game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria: <em>every
contributes</em>, and <em>nobody contributes</em>. Which of these
stable outcomes ensues will crucially depend on the players&rsquo;
reasoning, their expectations about each other, and perhaps even
further information stemming, for instance, from pre-game
communication.</p>

<p>
Clearly, analyzing strategic games involves agentive information,
reasoning and expectations. All these aspects have tight connections
to logic. Viewing outcomes as possible worlds, three relevant
relations emerge between these. Within the matrix above, relating all
cells in the same row fixes a unique choice already made by the row
player <i>A</i>, while leaving <i>E</i>&rsquo;s move completely open.
In short, each horizontal row lists all possible choices of the column
player <i>E</i> which <i>A</i> has to take into account. The
corresponding modality may hence be said to describe <i>A</i>&rsquo;s
knowledge about the outcomes of the game given his choice. Still
assuming the row player&rsquo;s perspective, relating cells vertically
rather than horizontally corresponds to <i>A</i>&rsquo;s freedom of
choice among his available strategies. Of course, one could also
assume player <i>E</i>&rsquo;s perspective instead, viewing the
horizontal direction as <i>E</i>&rsquo;s freedom of movement, while
the vertical directions captures her epistemic uncertainty.</p>

<p>
Thus, a bimodal logic arises for matrix games with laws such as</p>

\[{K_{E}K_{A}\varphi} \leftrightarrow  {K_{A}K_{E}\varphi},\] 

<p>
capturing the grid structure of matrix games. For more than two
players, this logic gains some additional options and subtleties to be
discussed in
 <a href="#LogicStrategicGames">Section 2.6</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The crucial third relation is that of player&rsquo;s preferences among
outcomes. These, again, have matching modalities, now taken from
preference logic <span class="citation">(Hansson 2001)</span>. With
the help of some auxiliary devices, the three modalities can define
the central game-theoretic notion of a Nash equilibrium <span class="citation">(Harrenstein
2004; van der Hoek &amp; Pauly
2007)</span>.</p>

<p>
Logics for matrix games differ from those for extensive games, as
grids behave quite differently from trees in terms of complexity. Yet,
both fall under the same general methodology. Towards a common
understanding, one might view the logic of matrix games as capturing
the basic laws of parallel, rather than sequential action.</p>

<h3 id="CompAgen">1.3 Computation and Agency</h3>

<p>
Philosophical logic and mathematical logic are not the only
illuminating perspectives on games. A third relevant viewpoint is that
of computational logic. In modern computation, the paradigm is no
longer single Turing machines but interacting systems of multiple
processors. These processors may cooperate, but they might also
compete for resources. In general, hence, it is useful to study
multiple agents engaging in computation, be it within human,
artificial or mixed societies. Though doing so, games become a natural
model for computation, too. In fact, games are rich multi-agent
systems where agents process information, communicate, and engage in
actions, all driven by their respective preferences and goals. In the
converse direction, computer science themes such as complexity and
algorithmics have entered game theory, resulting in the area of <span>
computational game theory</span> <span class="citation">(Nisan et al.
2007)</span>. For a richer survey of computational logics of agency
and games, see <span class="citation">van der Hoek and Pauly
(2007)</span> and <span class="citation">Shoham and Leyton-Brown
(2008)</span>. The present entry contains occasional links to
computation. These are especially prominent for reasoning about
temporally extended games and their strategies (Sections
 <a href="#sec:beliefplay">4.2</a>,
 <a href="#Play:FurtherDirections">4.4</a>) and in the context of gamification
 (<a href="#section:gamification">Section 6</a>),
 where games are explored as a novel semantics for classical logical
systems.</p>

<h3 id="GameLogi">1.4 Games in Logic</h3>

<p>
Finally, recall the start of this section, but with reverse
perspective: instead of asking what logic can do for games, ask what
games can do for logic. Argumentation and dialogue are basic notions
for logic. Both can be studied using techniques and results from game
theory <span class="citation">(Lorenzen &amp; Lorenz 1978; Hamblin
1970)</span>. In this perspective, logical validity of consequence
rests on there being a winning strategy for a Proponent claiming the
conclusion against an Opponent granting the premises in a game where
moves are regulated by the logical constants. Many games have found
uses in modern logic since the 1950s, with
Ehrenfeucht-Fra&iuml;ss&eacute; games for model comparison being a
paradigmatic example. Besides these, also semantic verification or
model construction can be cast as
 <a href="../logic-games/index.html">natural logic games</a>.</p>
 

<p>
This raises an intricate issue within in the philosophy of logic,
concerning the nature of logic and in particular that of logical
constants. A &lsquo;weak thesis&rsquo; would hold that games
constitute a natural technique for analyzing logical notions, as well
as a didactic tool for teaching logic that appeals directly to vivid
intuitions. Parts of the literature, however, also defend a
&lsquo;strong thesis&rsquo;, suggesting that the primary semantics of
certain logical systems may be procedural and game-theoretic, rather
than denotational in a standard sense. This perspective, sometimes
called &lsquo;logic as games&rsquo;, occurs in some attractive
semantics for first-order languages <span class="citation">(Hintikka
&amp; Sandu 1997)</span>, as well as in
 <a href="../games-abstraction/index.html">game semantics for programming languages</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The theme of logic as games will appear only briefly in the present
entry, which is mainly directed toward logics of games.
 <a href="#section:gamification">Section 6</a>
 will discuss which questions arise from joining both perspectives on
the interface of logic and games.</p>

<p>
As it happens, the logic-as-games perspective is of broader relevance.
Logic games were originally designed for particular tasks inside
logic. Yet, taken to reality, they can help analyze or streamline
actual lines of argumentation. As such they may be compared to
designed parlor games that challenge reasoning skills. A game like
<em>Clue</em> involves an intriguing mix of logical deduction, new
information from drawing cards or public observation of moves, but
also private communication acts by players <span class="citation">(van
Ditmarsch 2000)</span>. Other parlor games, such as <em>Nine Men
Morris</em> <span class="citation">(Gasser 1996)</span> are graph
games <span class="citation">(Gr&auml;del, Thomas, &amp; Wilke
2002)</span> with added chance moves that serve to diminish the risk
of finding a repeatable simple strategy on the fixed board. The
logical study of playable designed games for bounded agents, and the
design of new such games, is a natural sequel to this entry <span class="citation">(cf.
van Benthem &amp; Liu 2019)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="Prob">1.5 Probability</h3>

<p>
Game theory may be understood as generalized interactive decision
theory. A major vehicle for the latter, just as for standard decision
theory, is probability theory. Within games, probability can assume
many roles. It may, for instance, express players&rsquo; degrees of
belief quantitatively, but it can also enrich the space of actions
with mixed strategies, thereby laying the ground for general
equilibrium results. Probability can even play a role in the very
definition of certain important games, especially in evolutionary game
theory <span class="citation">(Osborne &amp; Rubinstein 1994)</span>.
In this entry, probability is only mentioned in passing.
 <a href="#section:probability">Section 5</a>,
 however, maps some combinations of logic and probability that are
suggested by the study of games.</p>

<h3 id="Zoom">1.6 Zooming In</h3>

<p>
Games have a natural interface with logic in all its varieties,
including mathematical, philosophical, and computational logic. In one
direction of contact, logic can provide new abstract notions
underneath game theory. Conversely, game-theoretic notions can also
serve to enrich logical analysis. The present entry mainly
concentrates on the first of these directions, the use of logic for
analyzing games. It does so mostly from a semantic perspective, the
dominant paradigm so far in the area. Though proof-theoretic
approaches will be mentioned occasionally. The sections to follow
elaborate on this theme along several dimensions. Specific
perspectives include logics for game structures
 (<a href="#gamestructures">Section 2</a>),
 logical analysis of the nature of players
 (<a href="#natplayers">Section 3</a>)
 and of the process of game play
 (<a href="#section:play">Section 4</a>).
 Additional spotlights are put on the relationship between logic and
probability in the context of games
 (<a href="#section:probability">Section 5</a>)
 and the endeavor of Gamification
 (<a href="#section:gamification">Section 6</a>).
 Each section forms a free-standing exposition, which results in some
unavoidable, and perhaps useful, overlap. Throughout the exposition,
some familiarity is assumed with the basic concepts of logic and game
theory. In particular, notions of game theory left unexplained here
can be found in the corresponding
 <a href="../game-theory/index.html">entry</a>
 and in <span class="citation">Leyton-Brown and Shoham
(2008)</span>.</p>

<div id="gamestructures">

<h2 id="GameStruGameLogi">2. Game Structure and Game Logics</h2>

<p>
This first spotlight section focuses on game structures in a narrow
sense. <em>Game forms</em> leave aside agents and notions typical for
these, such as preferences or information. Players, as well as the
temporal progression of play will be added in later sections. Even so,
there is already a good deal of structure in game forms to be studied by
logical techniques.</p>

<div id="gamerep">

<h3 id="LeveRepr">2.1 Levels of Representation</h3>

<p>
The starting point of any logical analysis is to fix its perspective
on games. This section will review several major candidates for doing
so, starting with the two most prominent perspectives. The first of
these makes the temporal structure of a game explicit, representing it
as a tree in the standard mathematical sense.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> A two-player extensive form
game.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig3">
<img src="fig3.svg" alt="This is a game tree diagram illustrating the example. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 3.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig3" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
A game in <em>extensive form</em> is a tree where each non-terminal
node or <em>state</em> specifies which player is to move next, while
edges correspond to the players&rsquo; possible moves. The leaves of
the tree, finally, denote the possible outcomes <i>O</i> of game play.
There are many possible variations on these stipulations for states
and moves, but they do not affect the essentials of a logical
analysis.</p>

<p>
The second major perspective on games emphasizes the players&rsquo;
available strategies. Suppressing all information about temporal
structure, a game in <em>strategic form</em> yields the matrix
pictures known from game theory. In its classic interpretation, a game
in strategic form represents a set of players that each select a
complete strategy for the entire game without knowledge of the other
players&rsquo; choices. Each strategy profile, i.e., combination of
one strategy per player, then induces an outcome \(O_i\). The
motivation for this structure might seem complex on first sight. Yet,
it can also be viewed as something quite simple: a one-step game with
parallel rather than sequential moves, which is the simplest case of
simultaneous action.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> A two-player strategic form
game.</p>

<table class="cell-center centered avoid-break cellpad-small-dense inner-rules">

<th style="border:none"></th>

</table>

<p>
Extensive and strategic forms differ in their focus. The former
emphasize the sequential temporal structure of a game, while the
latter highlights strategy choice prior to play. One can freely switch
between both when appropriate to the purpose at hand. Besides these
two, there are other natural dimensions, highlighting players&rsquo;
powers for influencing outcomes (cf.
 <a href="#subsect:power">Section 2.5</a>)
 or players&rsquo; information about the game (cf.
 <a href="#subsect:epistemic">Section 3.6</a>).</p>
 
<p>
<span><strong>Remark</strong></span> While all examples so far
concerned two-player games, no such restriction is needed. Both
extensive games and strategic form games work for any number of
players, although occasional subtleties may occur. A few will be
mentioned below. Moreover, with more players, possible coalitions
enter the picture, a topic that will not be treated in this entry.
Finally, selected aspects of agency may sometimes enter through the
back door. Many scenarios in real life contain external chance events
outside of any player&rsquo;s control, such as a roll of a die,
weather conditions, or technical malfunctions. Such factors can
usually be incorporated into a logical analysis by admitting Nature as
additional player.</p>
</div>

<div id="subsec:invariance">

<h3 id="InvaRelaBetwGame">2.2 Invariance Relations Between Games</h3>

<p>
With different ways of representing a game at hand, there is a natural
follow up question concerning equivalence. Given two game structures,
when are they representations of the same underlying game? The answer
is that it very much depends on what aspects one is interested in.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> The same game, or not?</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig4">
<img src="fig4.svg" alt="This has two game tree diagrams illustrating the example. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 4.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig4" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
Consider the two game forms above. If one cares about exact sequences
of moves or the choices players have along the way, these games are
different. The game to the left has <i>A</i> move first, while
<i>E</i> begins in the game on the right. In the game on the right,
<i>A</i> may face a choice between <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>. This cannot
happen on the left.</p>

<p>
Caring about exact moves as done here constitutes a fine-grained
perspective on games. There are others. When focusing on
players&rsquo; powers for bringing about certain outcomes, for
instance, the analysis changes. In the game on the left, <i>A</i> has
a strategy (playing <em>left</em>) that ensures the game to end up in
an outcome satisfying <i>p</i>, and one (playing <em>right</em>) that
restricts possible outcomes to those satisfying \(q \lor r\). With
this second strategy, the further choice which of \(q or r\) gets
realized is left up to player <i>E</i>. Also the second player,
<i>E</i>, has two strategies in the game on the left, one (playing
<em>left</em>) ensuring the outcome to satisfy \(p\lor q\), the other
(playing <em>right</em>) guaranteeing that the outcome satisfies \(p
\lor r\).</p>

<p>
Performing the same calculations for the game on the right, virtually
the same player powers emerge. More precisely, <i>A</i>&rsquo;s
uniform strategies <em>left-left</em> and <em>right-right</em> yield
<i>p</i> and \(q\lor r\) respectively, exactly the same powers as in
the left game. The two remaining strategies <em>left-right</em> and
<em>right-left</em> yield \(p\lor q\) and \(p\lor r\), both of which
are mere weakenings of <i>A</i>&rsquo;s power to achieve <i>p</i>.
Thus, at the level of players&rsquo; powers, the above two game forms
should be considered the same.</p>

<p>
As this example illustrates, there are several legitimate ways of
comparing games. When taking a fine-grained focus on the internal
structure of a game, a natural candidate is the notion of a
<em>bisimulation</em> <span class="citation">(cf. Blackburn, de Rijke,
&amp; Venema 2001)</span>. A bisimulation \(Z\subseteq G_1\times G_2\)
relates states of two game forms \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) subject to four
conditions: States <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> may only be related when
(<em>i</em>) the same player is to move in <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>,
(<em>ii</em>) <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> do not differ in any of their
basic local properties, while (<em>iii</em>a) whenever there is an
available move of type <i>a</i> in \(G_1\) leading to a state \(m'\),
there is a matching available move of type <i>a</i> in \(G_2\) leading
to a state \(n'\) with \(m'Zn'\), and vice versa (<em>iii</em>b)
whenever there is a move in \(G_2\) that leads to a state \(n'\),
there there is a move of the same type in \(G_1\) leading to a state
\(m'\) with \(m'Zn'\).</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> A bisimulation between
games.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig5">
<img src="fig5.svg" alt="This has two game tree diagrams illustrating the example. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 5.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig5" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
This particular notion of bisimulation is not the only invariance that
makes sense for games. A more coarse-grained perspective, for
instance, might not distinguish moves by their particular action
types, but merely by which player is to perform them. A corresponding
bisimulation can be defined by omitting references to particular
action types in conditions (<em>iii</em>a) and (<em>iii</em>b)
above.</p>

<p>
Further notions of bisimulation take an even coarser perspective on
the games&rsquo; move structure, for instance by allowing to contract
zones where the same player moves several times in a row. Finally,
dropping all information about players and their choices, games can be
compared by the sequences of moves they admit. This purely
observational notion, known as <em>trace equivalence</em> in
computation, may, however, be less relevant in the context of games.
An alternative approach to coarsening focuses on the players&rsquo;
powers to control outcomes, cf.
 <a href="#subsect:power">Section 2.5</a> and <span class="citation">van Benthem, Bezhanishvili and Enqvist (forthcoming-a)</span>.</p>
 
<p>
While most notions of invariance discussed so far related to extensive
form games, a similar style of analysis applies to games in strategic
form. <span class="citation">Van Benthem, Pacuit, and Roy
(2011)</span> define modal bisimulations that connect outcome states
of different matrices, and apply bisimulation&rsquo;s back-and-forth
conditions to the relevant relations of players&rsquo; choice,
freedom, and preference.</p>

<p>
This may be a good point to stress once more that the present section
is concerned with game forms only, omitting any player related aspect
such as preferences between outcomes. When these are added,
identifying appropriate notions of invariance becomes more
challenging, as will be discussed in
 <a href="#natplayers">Section 3</a>
 below.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="LangMatcInvaRela">2.3 Languages Matching Invariance Relations</h3>

<p>
The choice of invariance relations mirrors which structure is deemed
relevant within a given perspective on games. A central tool for
bringing out such relevant aspects is the existence of a logical
language matching some invariance relation. In general, the more
fine-grained the invariance perspective, the more distinctions a
matching language should be able to make.</p>

<p>
For a start, if one is interested in the properties a player can bring
about through moves, a good choice of language is based on modalities
\(\langle \move_i\rangle \varphi\), expressing that at least one of
<i>i</i>&rsquo;s available moves leads to a next stage satisfying
\(\varphi\). The following illustrates how this language works in a
given extensive form game.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Modal game language.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig6">
<img src="fig6.svg" alt="This is a game tree diagram illustrating the example. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 6.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig6" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
The modal formula \([\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle \win_E\), true at
root <i>r</i>, expresses that <i>E</i> has a strategy that ensures her
a win in two steps: whatever <i>A</i> does, <i>E</i> can react in such
a way that she ends up in a node where she wins. In a more
fine-grained perspective, the modal language could add expressions
\([a],[b]\ldots\) for specific move types \(a,b,\ldots\). In this
language, the coarse-grained modality \(\langle \move_i\rangle
\varphi\) is definable by the disjunction \(\bigvee_{a\text{ is a move
for }i}\langle a \rangle\varphi\), making the new language a
refinement of the old.</p>

<p>
In this way, general results of modal logic apply to games. For
instance, take pointed models such as game trees with an indicator for
the current moment. Whenever two such pointed models \(\G,m\) and
\(\G',m'\) are bisimilar in the first sense defined above, the
equivalence \(\G, m\vDash\varphi\) iff \(\G', m'\vDash\varphi\) holds
for all formulas \(\varphi\) in a sufficiently rich modal language
with modalities \([a]\) for each move label. Thus, one can switch
between syntactic, language based perspectives and semantic invariance
relations, depending on what is convenient for a given perspective on
games. Entirely similar points hold for bisimulations and modal
languages for power perspectives, or for strategic form games.</p>

<p>
Finally, modal languages do not have exclusive rights. If still more
fine-grained perspectives are needed, more expressive first-order or
higher-order languages become serious contenders for describing
games.</p>

<div id="modextgame">

<h3 id="ModaLogiExteGame">2.4 Modal Logic of Extensive Games</h3>

<p>
A language for games facilitates both, defining properties of games
and reasoning about them. An example are winning strategies for
players in a two-step extensive game as just discussed. More
generally, for any finite extensive game, there are formulas
\(\varphi_j\) for each agent <i>j</i> that are true iff <i>j</i> has a
winning strategy:</p> 

\[\varphi_j:=[\move_i]\langle \move_j\rangle[\move_i]\ldots \win_j\]

<p>
where the number of operators in the formula corresponds to the depth
of the tree.</p>

<p>
Thus, logical laws governing reasoning with such formulas acquire
game-theoretic content. For instance, the negation of the statement
that one player, <i>A</i>, has a winning strategy is provably
equivalent to saying that the other player, <i>E</i>, has a winning
strategy, at least in those cases where <i>A</i> wins if and only if
<i>E</i> does not: </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\neg \varphi_A &amp;= \neg\langle \move_A\rangle [\move_E]\langle \move_E\rangle\ldots \win_A \\
&amp; \leftrightarrow [\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle[\move_E]\ldots \neg \win_A\\
&amp; \leftrightarrow [\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle[\move_E]\ldots \win_E=\varphi_E
\end{aligned}\]

<p>
Hence, the logical law of excluded middle in its modal guise
corresponds to Zermelo&rsquo;s theorem, stating determinacy for finite
games.</p>

<p>
Yet, there are limitations to such characterizations of game-theoretic
properties in terms of logical laws. Formulas stating whether some
player has a winning strategy change from model to model, as the
number of modal operators depends on the size of the game tree. In
fact, there is no uniform formula in the basic modal language
expressing that player <i>i</i> can win in an arbitrary finite
extensive form game. Such a formula can only be found in the modal
&mu;-calculus <span class="citation">(Venema 2008)</span>, where the
statement that <i>i</i> has winning strategy can be expressed with the
fixed-point formula </p> 

\[\mu p. \, (\win_{i} \lor\, (\turn_i\land \langle i\rangle p)\lor\bigwedge_{j\neq i}(\turn_j\land\, [j]p)\]

<p>
The more general point here is that the recursive nature of
game-theoretic equilibria and solution concepts reflects naturally in
logics with fixed-point operators for induction and recursion.</p>

<p>
In this setting, known results about modal logic acquire a new
significance. In the realm of finite models, for instance, having the
same modal formulas true at two states is <em>equivalent</em> to there
being a bisimulation connecting those two states <span class="citation">(cf.
Blackburn, de Rijke, &amp; Venema 2001)</span>.
Hence, whenever two finite games satisfy the same modal propositions
in their respective roots they are equivalent in the sense of
bisimulation. For infinite models, such results are less direct. A
full equivalence between bisimulation and satisfying the same
formulas, for instance, only holds for an extended modal language with
infinite conjunctions and disjunctions. Other relevant results include
the existence of modal formulas that define given pointed models up to
bisimulation. Such formulas sometimes exist in the basic modal
language, sometimes in the &mu;-calculus, and always in the infinitary
modal language. Applied to concrete games <i>G</i>, these modal
definitions can be viewed as complete descriptions of all properties
of <i>G</i> at the relevant level of invariance.</p>

<p>
Finally, modal logic has many complete proof systems for capturing the
valid consequences on various classes of models <span class="citation">(Blackburn,
de Rijke, &amp; Venema 2001)</span>.
These calculi of reasoning also apply to games, where they can capture
aspects of specialized game-theoretic argumentation. Proof-theoretic
perspectives are not the focus of this entry, but a number of strands
will be mentioned where appropriate.</p>
</div>

<div id="subsect:power">

<h3 id="ModaNeigLogiForPowe">2.5 Modal Neighborhood Logic for Powers</h3>

<p>
Besides extensive form games, standard modal logic is also suitable
for the power perspective on game structure. Sometimes, one ignores
the internal mechanisms of a game altogether, merely viewing it as a
black box social mechanisms where players control outcomes to a
certain extent. In this perspective, a player can <em>force</em> the
outcome of the game to be in some set <i>X</i> if she commands a
strategy that ensures the game to end up in an outcome of <i>X</i>, no
matter what the other players do <span class="citation">(van
der Hoek &amp; Pauly 2007)</span>. Similarly, a player can force that
some proposition \(\varphi\) holds if she has the power to enforce
that the game ends in a \(\varphi\) state. The collection of all sets
of outcomes an agent can force are often called her <em>forcing
powers</em>. In classical game theory, these forcing powers sometimes
go by the name of <em>effectivity functions</em> <span class="citation">(Peleg
1997)</span>, which are often also studied for
coalitions of players <span class="citation">(see Pauly 2001; Goranko,
Jamroga, &amp; Turrini 2013; and the entry on

<p>
Notably, forcing powers are not closed under conjunction. In the game
above, agent <i>A</i> can force <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> individually
without being able to force \(p \land q\). In modal logic terms,
forcing powers give rise to a <em>neighborhood logic</em> <span class="citation">(Pacuit
2017)</span>, where the neighborhood
functions list the set of outcomes players can enforce from a given
state. Reasoning about forcing powers can then employ a logical
language with forcing modalities \(\{i\}\) for each player:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p class="center">
\(\{i\}\varphi\): agent <i>i</i> can force the outcome of the game to
satisfy \(\varphi\). </p>
</div>

<p>
These modalities can be interpreted over the extended game forms with
neighborhood functions described above. On the semantic side, a
generalization of the above neighborhood models support a
generalized notion of <em>power bisimulation</em>, see <span class="citation">van
Benthem, Pacuit, and Roy (2011)</span>.</p>

<p>
The modal logic of powers allows to reason about games at a global
level of description. The modal logic of neighborhood models validates
the standard modal monotonicity principle</p> 

\[\{i\}\varphi\rightarrow\{i\}(\varphi\lor\psi),\]

<p>as follows
already from the truth definition of forcing modalities. However, as
forcing powers are not closed under intersection, the aggregation law
fails:</p> 

\[(\{i\}\varphi\land\{i\}\psi)\not\rightarrow\{i\}(\varphi\land\psi).\]

<p>
Instead, the logic contains new valid principles relating forcing
modalities for different players. For instance, if <i>i</i> can force
the truth of \(\varphi\), then no other player <i>j</i> can force its
falsity. Thus,</p> 

\[\{i\}\varphi\rightarrow\neg\{j\}\neg\varphi\]

<p>
is a valid principle of &lsquo;consistency of powers&rsquo; in the
logic of forcing powers. The converse of this principle for games with
two players \(i, j\)</p> 

\[\neg\{j\}\neg\varphi \rightarrow \{i\}\varphi\]

<p>
expresses the notion of determinacy from the last section. This
formula is not generally valid, but is an axiom for the special
class of determined games.</p>

<p>
Finally, there also is an alternative, more algebraic perspective on
powers, assuming an earlier-mentioned perspective of logic games. The
two games depicted in the core example of
 <a href="#subsec:invariance">Section 2.2</a>
 may be seen as evaluation games for propositional formulas</p>

\[p \land  (q \lor r) \quad \text{and} \quad (p \land q) \lor (p \land r).\]

<p>
Their equivalence <em>qua</em> powers, described earlier, then matches
the standard propositional law of distribution. This algebraic
perspective will return in
 <a href="#section:gamealgebra">Section 2.9</a>.</p>
 

<p>
More recent views of forcing and powers re-interpret the sets <i>X</i>
of outcomes employed in the above definitions as referring to both
players: one player restricts the total set of outcomes, while the
other players can achieve all outcomes within that set. This variation
significantly impacts the corresponding notions of game equivalence,
as well as the modal languages used <span class="citation">(van
Benthem, Bezhanishvili, &amp; Enqvist forthcomingb)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="ModaLogiForStraGame">2.6 Modal Logic for Strategic Games</h3>

<p>
In the strategic perspective on games, players select actions
simultaneously, without having learned about their opponents&rsquo;
choices of actions. This requires an additional level of analysis.
Besides the various possible moves, an adequate representation must
also track players&rsquo; uncertainty about how their opponents might
act.</p>

<p>
In terms of matching logical languages, this suggest a
<em>multi-modal</em> approach, with \([\approx_i]\) ranging over
<i>i</i>&rsquo;s possible choices, and \([\equiv_i]\) representing her
uncertainty about the opponents, see <span class="citation">van
Benthem, Pacuit, and Roy (2011)</span>. Moreover, when considering
games rather than game forms, this picture needs to be enriched with a
third feature, viz. preference modalities \([\preceq_i]\), see
 <a href="#natplayers">Section 3</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Games in strategic form can be viewed naturally as models for a modal
language of choice and uncertainty, where each <em>state</em> <i>m</i>
consists of a strategy profiles, i.e., a sequence \((m_1,m_2\ldots)\)
listing each player&rsquo;s choice of action. For convenience, the
preference modality has been included:</p>

<div class="indent">

<table class="cellpad-med-dense vert-top">
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>\(\G,m\vDash[\approx_i]\varphi\)</td>
  <td>Given the opponents&rsquo; actions, \(\varphi\) holds whatever
<i>i</i> does.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\G,m\vDash[\equiv_i]\varphi\)</td>
  <td>Given <i>i</i>&rsquo;s choice, \(\varphi\) holds whatever the
opponents do.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\G,m\vDash[\preceq_i]\varphi\)</td>
  <td>\(\varphi\) holds in all states at least as good as the current
one.</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>
This multi-modal language can express a variety of statements about
strategic form games, such as:</p>

<div class="indent">

<table class="cellpad-med-dense">
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>\({\langle\approx_i\rangle\langle\equiv_i\rangle} \varphi\)</td>
  <td>\(\varphi\) is a possible outcome of the game</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\({[\approx_i][\equiv_i]}\varphi\)</td>
  <td>all outcomes of the game satisfy \(\varphi\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\([\preceq_i]\langle\preceq_i\rangle\varphi\)</td>
  <td>some optimal states for player <i>i</i> satisfy \(\varphi\)</td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>
In the case of two players, one agent&rsquo;s choices corresponds to
the other&rsquo;s uncertainty and vice versa. This shows in the
validity of principles such as </p> 

\[[\equiv_i]\varphi\leftrightarrow[\approx_j]\varphi\]

<p>
More generally, the logic of matrix games includes the \(\mathsf{S}5\)
axioms for both \([\approx_i]\) and \([\equiv_i]\), but also the
commutation law</p> 

\[[\approx_i] [\equiv_i]\varphi\leftrightarrow[\equiv_i][\approx_i]\varphi\]

<p>
expressing the grid-like structure of matrix games. This logic bears
some resemblance to STIT-type logics of actions <span class="citation">(Herzig
&amp; Lorini 2010)</span>. Technically, a
grid structure in models allows for encoding of undecidable
computational problems <span><span class="citation">(Blackburn, de
Rijke, &amp; Venema 2001)</span></span>, rendering it an open problem
whether expressive modal logics of game matrices are decidable.</p>

<p>
The step from two to more players, often routine in epistemic logics,
can be delicate in the logic of matrix games. Accessibility relations
of type \([\approx_i]\), interpreted as identity of profiles except
for the \(i^{}\)-coordinate, yield a product logic akin to the
three-variable fragment of first-order logic which is known to be
undecidable <span class="citation">(Bezhanishvili 2006)</span>.
However, with only relations of identity at the <i>i</i>-coordinate,
i.e., \([\equiv_i]\), the logic remains decidable <span class="citation">(Venema
1998; Van De Putte, Tamminga, &amp; Duijf
2017; Lomuscio, van der Meyden, &amp; Ryan 2000)</span>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="StraLogiObje">2.7 Strategies as Logical Objects</h3>

<p>
There is further structure in extensive games than just single moves.
In game trees, a player&rsquo;s <em>strategy</em> specifies what to do
at each turn, whether this turn will ever be reached or not. An
increasing body of work examines such strategies and their underlying
formats, see <span class="citation">van Benthem, Ghosh, and Verbrugge
(2015)</span> for an overview of various logical frameworks for
reasoning about strategies.</p>

<p>
In one concrete perspective, a strategy is akin to a program that
instructs the agent on how to navigate a game tree. Hence, a natural
logic of strategies uses the language of
 <a href="../logic-dynamic/index.html">propositional dynamic logic of programs</a>
 PDL, an approach that will return later. As programs are in general
non-deterministic, such logics let a strategy recommend one or more
actions the agent should take at each turn. In this perspective,
strategies resemble plans that might remain partial.</p>

<p>
In a program format, strategies start with basic actions, representing
individual moves in a game tree. From there, complex programs \(\pi\)
can be created using operations including sequential compositions
\(\pi_{1} \,;\pi_{2}\) (\(\pi_{1}\) is to be performed followed by
\(\pi_{2}\)), or choice \(\pi_{1}\, \cup_{i} \pi_{2}\) (agent <i>i</i>
is to pick between actions \(\pi_{1}\) and \(\pi_{2}\) ). Moreover, a
test operation \(?\varphi\) for checking whether \(\varphi\) holds,
enables strategies to react to properties of states or
opponents&rsquo; past actions. Finally, to describe continuous
execution of a strategy along a game tree, it makes sense to have an
operation \(\pi^{*}\) of program iteration, stating that \(\pi\) be
executed arbitrarily often.</p>

<p>
The language of PDL then has modal operators \([\pi]\) for every
program \(\pi\) that can be defined from the basic actions and the
operations just described. A simple such strategy advises player
<i>i</i> to do <i>a</i> whenever it is her turn. The following formula
states that this strategy ensures that \(\varphi\) holds
throughout:</p> 

\[
[((?\turn_i \mathbin{;}  a)\, \cup \, (?\turn_j \mathbin{;} \move_j))^{*}]\varphi
\]

<p>
Program definitions for strategies given here are closely related to
the use of finite automata for defining strategies in computer science
and game theory <span class="citation">(Osborne &amp; Rubinstein 1994;
Gr&auml;del, Thomas, &amp; Wilke 2002; Ramanujam &amp; Simon
2008)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="SimuMoveImpeInfo">2.8 Simultaneous Moves and Imperfect Information</h3>

<p>
In the extensive form games of
 <a href="#gamerep">Section 2.1</a>,
 players move in sequence and can base their decisions on full
information of what has happened so far. The other extreme were games
in strategic form, where agents move in parallel or, in the
interpretation of strategy selection, have no means of picking up
information during actual play. There are ample scenarios in between
these extremes. Public good games with optional retribution against
non-cooperators <span class="citation">(Andrighetto et al.
2013)</span>, for instance, combine moments where some or all players
make simultaneous moves with information collection along the way.
Such parallel action can be mimicked in sequential games by limiting
the information available to players at various states of the game.
The resulting games of imperfect information will be discussed in
 <a href="#natplayers">Section 3</a>,
 alongside other sources of imperfect information.</p>

<p>
Further well-known logical approaches to parallel action employ STIT
logic <span class="citation">(Horty &amp; Belnap 1995; Broersen
2009)</span>, and temporal logics such as ATL <span class="citation">(Alur,
Henzinger, &amp; Kupferman 2002)</span> or its
epistemic variant ATEL <span class="citation">(van der Hoek &amp;
Wooldridge 2003)</span>.</p>

<div id="section:gamealgebra">

<h3 id="GameAlgeDynaLogiComp">2.9 Game Algebra and Dynamic Logic of Computation</h3>

<p>
So far, games were treated as monolithic entities that agents reason
about in their entirety. This can be at odds with how real life agents
conceptualize games. To facilitate reasoning, games are often broken
up into smaller tasks that are easier to handle separately. A chess
player, for instance, may know how to solve different end games.
Rather than reasoning about every possible situation until its end,
she will evaluate different options in mid-play by considering which
of these end games they will, most likely, lead up to. In this
perspective, complex games are constructed out of simpler games that
may profit from separate analysis. Games then form an algebra with
operations that construct complex games from simpler ones. This style
of thinking is reinforced when games are viewed as scenarios for
interactive computation, where again algebraic methods are used
widely <span class="citation">(Bergstra, Ponse, &amp; Smolka
2001)</span>.</p>

<p>
Here is an illustration of this approach. For simplicity, consider
only two players, <i>A</i> and <i>E</i>, the latter of which starts
the game. One influential game algebra has the following operations,
cf. <span class="citation">Parikh (1985)</span>.</p>

<div class="indent">

<table class="cellpad-med-dense vert-top">
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>\(G\,\cup G'\)</td>
  <td>Agent <i>E</i> has the choice between playing <i>G</i> and
\(G'\), i.e., represented by a choice node with two outcomes <i>G</i>
and \(G'\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(G\,;G'\)</td>
  <td><i>G</i> is played first, followed by \(G'\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\((\cdot)^d\)</td>
  <td>The roles of the players <i>A</i> and <i>E</i> are
interchanged</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(?\varphi\)</td>
  <td>Test game whether some property \(\varphi\) holds.</td> </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>
For instance, take a chess player in mid-game reasoning. For
simplicity, restrict the possible end games to \(G_{F_1}\) and
\(G_{F_2}\). The player can then conceptualize mid-play as a game
\(G_{mid}\) with end nodes labeled by propositions \(p_1\) or \(p_2\),
describing which of the two end games follows. The full remaining
chess tree is then given by</p> 

\[G_{\textit{complete}}=G_{\textit{mid}};((?p_1;G_{F_1})\cup (?p_2;G_{F_2}))\]

<p>
Equational axiomatizations for this game algebra can be found in <span class="citation">Goranko
(2003)</span> and <span class="citation">Venema
(2003)</span>. However, following the analogy
of propositional dynamic logic for an algebra of programs, there also
is a <em>dynamic game logic</em> for this algebra of games, <span class="citation">(Parikh
1985)</span>. It adds a modality
\(\{G\}\varphi\) for each game <i>G</i>, with \(\{G\}\varphi\)
expressing that in game <i>G</i>, the first player <i>E</i> has a
strategy to force the truth of \(\varphi\). For the case of
non-determined games, the language will be extended further to include
separate modalities \(\{G, i\}\varphi\), one for each player <i>i</i>.
Dynamic game logic shows in a perspicuous manner how strategic
abilities for complex games supervene on abilities in simpler games.
This is done by means of reduction laws such as</p> 

\[\{G;G'\}\varphi\leftrightarrow \{G\}\{G'\}\varphi, \quad \{G\cup G'\}\varphi\leftrightarrow\{G\}\varphi\lor\{G'\}\varphi\]

<p>
For a complete list of reduction laws, as well as open problems in
this dynamic game logic see <span class="citation">Pauly (2001), van Benthem
(2014)</span>. For other styles of game algebra, including also forms
of parallel composition, cf. <span class="citation">Abramsky
(1997)</span>.</p>

<p>
It should be said that imperfect information challenges this approach
to game algebra. For instance, one may have to decompose a larger game
into smaller subgames where agents need not know which of these
subgames they are in. Game algebras with imperfect information have
been studied in the context of Boolean Games <span class="citation">(Harrenstein
et al. 2001)</span>. A recent
power-based game algebra with operations encoding imperfect
information, showing some analogies with IF logic <span class="citation">(Mann,

<h3 id="SpecTopi">2.10 Special Topics</h3>

<p>
<span><strong>Coalitions and Networks</strong></span> Nothing has been
said so far about social or structural relations between players: they
move individually and in interaction with all other players. However,
in many games, groups of players can team up to jointly pursue goals,
possibly in competition with other groups. Coalitions are a natural,
but non-trivial extension of the logical frameworks introduced here,
as strategic abilities of groups may exceed those of all members
combined, see <span class="citation">Peleg (1997)</span>, <span class="citation">Van de Putte &amp; Klein (2018)</span>, and the entry
on
 <a href="../logic-power-games/index.html">coalition powers in games</a>.
 In other studies of social phenomena, the set of players is equipped
with an additional network structure. An agents&rsquo; outcome or
behavior will then depend upon what network neighbors do <span class="citation">(Baltag
et al. forthcoming; Christoff 2016)</span>.
Lastly, games on networks are closely related to information flows in
social networks, as studied in depth by <span class="citation">Liu,
Seligman, and Girard (2014)</span> and <span class="citation">Seligman
and Thompson (2015)</span> from a logical perspective.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Tracking</strong></span> This section contains a wide
variety of perspectives on games. These differ in their invariance
relations and their matching languages, offering different foci such
as outcomes, powers, or the detailed temporal evolution of games. Even
further perspectives will no doubt keep emerging. This diversity may
seem overwhelming, making the field rather scattered. But here,
another role of logic shows, by not just proliferating systems, but
also as connecting them. Various logical translations exist between
the languages and levels involved. Often, reasoning about games in a
logic for some level can be mirrored precisely under translation into
the logic of another level. Moreover, these translations can often
keep track of changes in games under actions of information updates, a
topic to be taken up in Section 3. Tracking of this kind is defined
and studied in general logical terms in <span class="citation">van
Benthem (2016)</span> and <span class="citation">Cin&agrave;
(2017)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Infinite games</strong></span> So far, games were
tacitly assumed finite in length. This assumption is innocuous for
many real life scenarios, yet there are notable exceptions. A
prominent example are safety games, where one of the players, the
guard, has to ensure a system to never leave a certain state, while
the opponent attempts to deviate. Many technical tools for finite
games also work for infinite games. There is, however, a number of
conceptual and logical discontinuities. Since infinite games have no
last moments, for instance, outcomes must be attached to complete
histories of game play, rather than leaves of a tree. Reasoning about
games then requires temporal modalities for a given history, but also
modalities ranging over all open future histories. For analyzing
powers, then, temporal versions of forcing modalities are needed. With
these modifications, a logical style of analysis still applies. For
instance, it is well-known that determinacy fails for infinite games
<span class="citation">(Jech 2003)</span>. However, what holds for all
games is a law of &lsquo;weak determinacy&rsquo; stating that, if
<i>i</i> has no strategy to force a set of histories satisfying
\(\varphi\), her opponent <i>j</i> can ensure that <i>i</i> will never
obtain such a \(\varphi\)-strategy in the future. The difference
between standard determinacy and weak determinacy is captured by the
following two formulas, that are entirely in line with this
section&rsquo;s style of analysis:
\(\{i\}\varphi\,\lor\,\{j\}\neg\varphi\) (determinacy) versus
\(\{i\}\varphi\lor\{j\}G\neg\{i\}\varphi\) (weak determinacy), where
<i>G</i> is the temporal modality of &lsquo;always in the future on
the current history&rsquo;.</p>

<h2 id="NatuPlay">3. The Nature of Players</h2>

<p>
Game forms may be seen as spaces where players can operate. A game,
however, is not fully determined by its game form alone. Rather, the
players involved may import additional features relevant for game
play. Players can, for instance, be limited in their powers of
observation, either by aspects of the game structure or through
cognitive limitations. The most striking added feature, however, is
that players have preferences. Agents not only observe the world or
act in it. While these describe mere kinematics of a game, agents also
evaluate current state and various possible futures. Being driven by
preferences, it is such evaluations that are the moving force behind
player&rsquo;s choices. Preference, hence, take a prominent
explanatory role for true game dynamics.</p>

<p>
This section places its focus on the preferential and epistemic
dimensions of players. Such factors are essential to notions of
rationality where information, action, and preference are often
entangled. In game theory, a harmony between these is often sought in
notions of equilibrium for strategy profiles.</p>

<h3 id="PrefEqui">3.1 Preference and Equilibria</h3>

<p>
Game trees and game matrices specify the moves available to players at
different moments in time. They also indicate all possible outcomes,
either as cells in a matrix, or as leaf nodes in an extensive game.
However, to study what players <em>should</em> or <em>will</em> do in
a game, a further component is needed: players&rsquo; preferences.
Such preferences need not only reflect material pay-offs or other
features of outcome states. Rather, they may also relate to the
process of play itself, and which moves lead to a certain outcome. Moreover, preferences may contain irreducibly
subjective elements. Even when assuming the same role in a game,
different players may disagree about the relative desirability of
certain outcomes <span class="citation">(Fehr &amp; Schmidt
1999)</span>.</p>

<p>
Within a static, outcome-oriented perspective on games, a major
emphasis is on equilibria: strategy combinations where all players do
the best they can in light of their preferences and the
opponents&rsquo; strategies. A further, dynamic perspective focuses on
how such equilibria relate to the individual players&rsquo; stepwise local
reasoning on how to act in light of their beliefs and desires. This
perspective is taken up in
 <a href="#section:play">Section 4</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="PrefLogiForGame">3.2 Preference Logics for Games</h3>

<p>
For reasoning about preferences, it must first be specified what it is
that agents&rsquo; preferences apply to. The orthodox account lets
preferences exclusively range over possible outcomes <span class="citation">(Osborne
&amp; Rubinstein 1994)</span>. However, a
growing trend in the logical literature assumes agents to rather care
about the truth value of general propositions than can describe both
the progression or outcome of a game. While not equivalent, the two
perspectives are compatible. Both will be discussed in this
section.</p>

<p>
In the classical picture, player <i>i</i>&rsquo;s preferences on a
game tree are represented by a preference relation \(\prec_i\) ranging
over the set of outcomes. Such a relation is usually assumed
transitive and reflexive, but need not be total.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> A game tree with
preferences.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig8">
<img src="fig8.svg" alt="This is a game tree diagram illustrating the example. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 8.</span> 
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig8" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
Just as with the earlier modal logics for game forms, a relatively
simple logical formalism can already express relevant aspects of
agency in games. It offers a low-complexity language for stating
basic features of action and information, without going into details
of the underlying quantitative mechanisms. More precisely, games with
preferences naturally support a logic with modal operators
\([\preceq_i]\) interpreted as:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">\([\preceq_i]\varphi\)</span><span class="sen">\(\varphi\)
holds in all states at least as good as the
current one to agent <i>i</i>.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Logics of this type can express various properties relevant to games.
They can, for instance, say that all states better than the current
one are \(\varphi\) states, making moving towards \(\varphi\) states a
necessary condition for maximizing utility. They can also express,
that all best states are \(\varphi\) states, with the formula </p>

\[\langle\preceq_i\rangle[\preceq_i]\varphi\]

<p>
For more on modal preference logics, see <span class="citation">
Hansson (1990, 2001)</span>,<span class="citation">Girard
(2008)</span> and <span class="citation">van der Torre
(1997)</span>.</p>

<p>
Modal preference logic has further extensions with natural connections
to games. In a refined perspective, for instance, preferences may
derive from reasons, say, criteria or goals various agents want to
achieve. This gives rise to a duality between preference relations
among outcome states and priority orders over formulas, describing the
agents&rsquo; goals. Dynamic accounts, finally, track how preference
can change under various input events. For more on both of these
issues, see <span class="citation">Liu (2011)</span>.</p>

<p>
However, modal preference logics, construed either way, are not yet
rich enough to express one of the essential notions of game theory.
Further extensions are needed to deal with <em>best responses</em>,
expressing that the current move of a player is the best she can do in
light of her opponent&rsquo;s actions.</p>

<p>
Best response moves are the main ingredient for game equilibria.
Formally, a <em>Nash equilibrium</em> is a strategy profile, fixing a
unique choice for each player, where nobody can improve by
unilaterally changing strategy when all others maintain theirs. There
are several ways of defining this property in extended modal
preference languages. One possibility is to simply introduce a new
atom \(b_i\), stating that the current world is the best player
<i>i</i> could have achieved in light of the opponents&rsquo; actions.
In this language, Nash equilibrium are characterized by </p>

\[\bigwedge_{i\in \text{Players}}b_i.\]

<p>
More explicit definitions exist, building on the strict preference
modalities of <span class="citation">van Benthem, Girard, and Roy
(2009)</span>. Yet, perhaps the simplest illuminating approach uses an
<em>intersection modality</em> from hybrid logic <span class="citation">(Areces
and ten Cate 2007)</span> combining the
agent&rsquo;s preference relation with her uncertainty between the
opponent&rsquo;s action to characterize best responses and Nash
equilibria (cf.
 <a href="#LogicStrategicGames">Section 2.6</a>):</p>
 

\[\bigwedge_{i\in \text{Players}}[\prec_i\cap\equiv_i]\bot\]

<p>
Expressing Nash equilibrium has served as a benchmark for logics of
strategic games <span class="citation">(van der Hoek &amp; Pauly
2007)</span>. Yet there are other desiderata, often connected to
analyzing standard game-theoretic solution concepts for games. These
are usually designed to find Nash equilibria or at least narrow down
the strategy profiles to those compatible with certain requirements of
rationality. Well-known methods of this kind are Backward Induction
for extensive games and Iterated Removal of Strictly Dominated
Strategies for strategic form games <span class="citation">(Osborne
&amp; Rubinstein 1994)</span>. These will be discussed now, as they
raise intriguing further logical issues.</p>

<div id="sec:BIstatic">

<h3 id="BackInduExteFormGame">3.3 Backward Induction in Extensive Form Games</h3>

<p>
Here is a high-level description of Backward Induction. In extensive
game forms, the aim is to introduce a new preference-based relation
\(\best_i\), denoting that some move is the best a player can do at
some given state. Thus, \(\best_i\) is a subset of player
<i>i</i>&rsquo;s total move relation, to be defined in a suitable
manner.</p>

<p>
For final moves, standard decision theory suggests that a choice is
best for the active player if no other move leads to a better outcome.
When extending the analysis to earlier positions of the game, things
depend crucially on players&rsquo; expectations about their
opponents&rsquo; future behavior. Several possible policies exist,
depending on the types of player involved. A widespread assumption in
epistemic game theory is common belief in rationality, i.e., that all
players involved are rational, believe their opponents to be rational,
believe their opponents to believe that opponents are rational, and so
on. In line with this assumption, the following algorithm extends the
\(\best_i\) relation recursively to non-terminal nodes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Whenever player <i>i</i> is to move at state <i>s</i>, possible
choices are assessed by comparing what would happen if, after that

<i>s</i> is included in <i>i</i>&rsquo;s \(\best\) relation if the
best outcome of this move followed by repeated \(\best\) moves by all
players is at least as good as every other move <i>i</i> could make at
<i>s</i>, followed by \(\best\) moves by all players.</p>

<p>
This procedure is a qualitative version of classic game theory&rsquo;s
Backward Induction, which is based on utility values rather than
preference relations <span class="citation">(Leyton-Brown &amp; Shoham
2008)</span>.</p>

<p>
Backward Induction and the resulting \(\best\) relation is a prime
example for the complex entanglement of preferences, information and
action. A key modal axiom governing this relation was identified by
<span class="citation">van Benthem, van Otterloo, and Roy
(2006)</span>. \(\best^*\) denotes here the transitive closure of the
union of all \(\best_i\) relations.</p> 

\[
(\turn_i\land\langle \best\rangle[ \best^*](\operatorname{end}\rightarrow p))\rightarrow[\move_i]\langle  \best^*\rangle(\operatorname{end}\land\langle \preceq_i\rangle p)

Describing the limit of a dynamic process with a static property, this

<h3 id="IterRemoDomiStra">3.4 Iterated Removal of Dominated Strategies</h3>

<p>
Iterative reasoning strategies akin to Backward Induction also exist
for games in strategic form. Rather than defining a new unary
move-predicate \(\best\), however, these procedures work by
eliminating suboptimal actions. An action <i>a</i> is labeled
suboptimal or <em>dominated</em> if there is some other available
action, <i>b</i>, that guarantees a better result than <i>a</i>, no
matter what the opponents do. In this case a rational player should
drop <i>a</i> from her space of admissible acts, as she would never
play it.</p>

<p>
Just as Backward Induction, dominance reasoning has an iterative
flavor. Assuming common belief of rationality, players can expect
their opponents to also drop dominated actions from consideration.
Doing so reduces the game and might render further moves dominated, as
is illustrated in the following example. Within the left-to-right
temporal progression, moves are greyed out as they get discarded.
Players&rsquo; preferences are represented with numerical values with
1 the best and 4 the worst.</p>

<p>
The fact that further strategies may become dominated suggests to
repeat the procedure, turning removal of dominated strategies into an
iterated process. When games are finite, this process is guaranteed to
converge in finite time. Iterated removal of dominated strategies on
binary preference relations is a qualitative variant of the version
employed in classical game theory, where cardinal utility values are
assumed <span class="citation">(Leyton-Brown &amp; Shoham
2008)</span>.</p>

<p>
A closely related process is iterated removal of <em>weakly
dominated</em> strategies, where some move <i>a</i> is deleted if
there exists a <i>b</i> that outperforms <i>a</i> on some of the
opponents&rsquo; moves, while being at least as good on the remaining
ones. Unlike its strict counterpart, iterated removal of weakly
dominated strategies suffers from a number of technical and conceptual
intricacies, such as order dependence of iterated deletion <span class="citation">(Samuelson
1992; Pacuit &amp; Roy 2011)</span>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Goal">3.5 Goals</h3>

<p>
Generalizing the concept of winning or losing, agents can be assigned
goals they pursue in a game. Restricting to a single goal per agent
retains a binary perspective: A goal is reached or not. Goals,
however, allow for additional flexibility. Besides pure competition as
in win-lose games, these can also express pure coordination games,
with everybody pursuing the same goal, or mixed motive games with
partial overlap between different players&rsquo; goals.</p>

<p>
The concept of goal functions is particularly prominent in the logical
framework of
 <a href="../logic-power-games/index.html">Boolean games</a>
 <span class="citation">(Harrenstein 2004)</span>. There, each agent
is given control over some atomic propositions, permitting her to
freely decide on their truth value. Goals are then formulated as
propositional formulas over the set of all players&rsquo; atoms.
Crucially, a player&rsquo;s goal formula might hence involve atoms
that are not under her control. In iterated extensive Boolean games,
goal formulas might also refer to properties of histories of play
defined in temporal logics <span class="citation">(Gutierrez,
Harrenstein, &amp; Wooldridge 2015)</span></p>

<div id="subsect:epistemic">

<h3 id="KnowBeliLimiInfo">3.6 Knowledge, Belief, and Limits of Information</h3>

<p>
There are various types of information players can possess or lack
about a game. First and foremost, players can be uncertain about the
types of opponents they face: their preferences, their reasoning
about the game and how they expect the game to unfold. Second,
agents&rsquo; uncertainty can extend to the game itself. Players, of
course&rsquo; won&rsquo;t know their opponents choices in a
simultaneous move game. Besides, agents might also have limited
information about past moves and events. Such uncertainty can arise
from the game structure eschewing certain observations, but also from
failing to record past information properly. In yet more extreme
cases, agents might even be unsure about the moves available to their
opponents.</p>

<p>
Given the various limitations to their knowledge, players may
entertain beliefs to structure their uncertainty. Such beliefs may,
naturally, change over time, as players communicate or observe the
game unfold. The importance of beliefs in the logical analysis of
games has been emphasized in <span class="citation">Stalnaker
(1998)</span>, who was the first to highlight the role of belief
revision in analyzing reasoning about game solution.</p>

<h4 id="UnceAbouMove">3.6.1 Uncertainty about moves</h4>

<p>
In one sense of uncertainty, even highly idealized agents might have
but limited information of what has happened so far. In certain cases,
the game&rsquo;s structure may limit some players&rsquo; observational
powers of their opponents&rsquo; moves. In other instances, agents may
suffer under cognitive limitations restricting their perspective on
the game. Or, sometimes, agents might simply fail to record some of
the moves made by themselves or others.</p>

<p>
Within <em>extensive games with imperfect information</em>, all such
cases are represented by indistinguishability relations \(-\,-\,-\,-_A\)
between states \(m,m'\), expressing that agent <i>A</i> cannot
distinguish between being at <i>m</i> and \(m'\). Notably, this does
not preclude the player from learning later on in the game whether he
has been at <i>m</i> or \(m'\).</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> A game with imperfect
information.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig10">
<img src="fig10.svg" alt="This is a game tree diagram illustrating the example. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig10" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
While allowing agents to lack information of various kinds, the above
analysis makes one structural assumption about players: they always
know which moves are available to them at a given node. In extensive
games with imperfect information, this translates to the requirement
that whenever two states are indistinguishable to some agent, they
coincide on the set of her possible actions.</p>

<p>
The move from perfect to imperfect information has major implications
for strategic reasoning. In the game depicted above, player <i>A</i>
cannot distinguish between being at <i>m</i> and \(m'\). When at the
former, she may, for all she knows, be at \(m'\) instead. Hence
<i>A</i>&rsquo;s decision needs to account for both possibilities; she
cannot base her choice on any property that holds at only of those
locations. In particular, <i>A</i> has no available strategy that
guarantees her ending up in a \(\win_A\) node. Since <i>E</i> cannot
ensure a win either, no player has a winning strategy. This is a
central difference with finite perfect information games, where it is
guaranteed that one of the players has a winning strategy, cf.
 <a href="#modextgame">Section 2.4</a>.</p>
 
<h4 id="LogiImpeInfo">3.6.2 The logic of imperfect information</h4>

<p>
Reasoning about imperfect information requires to extended languages
for extensive form games with epistemic modalities. For each player
<i>i</i>, modality \(K_i\varphi\) represents <i>i</i>&rsquo;s
knowledge. The usual semantics of epistemic logic relates this to
uncertainty, as encoded by the players&rsquo;s indistinguishability
relation:</p>

<p class="center">
\(\mathcal{M},m\vDash K_i\varphi\quad\)
all states \(m' \text{ with } m\,-\,-\,-\,-_i\,m'\)
satisfy \(\mathcal{M},m'\vDash\varphi\)
</p>

<p>
This language is best illustrated with the above game tree. To this
end, interpret the tree as the classic children&rsquo;s game where one
player, <i>A</i>, has to guess in which hand her opponent, <i>E</i>,
hides some little token. Once <i>E</i> has hidden the token in, say,
her right hand (move \(h_R\)), the guessing player has a winning move
<em>de re</em>: she should pick <em>right</em> (\(p_R\)). However, as
the token was placed in secret, she may not know that picking
<em>right</em> is a winning move: the player has no winning strategy
<em>de dicto</em>. This is expressed by: </p> 

\[\mathcal{M},m\vDash [p_R]\win_A\land\neg K_A[p_R] \win_A.\]

<p>
In a game theoretic setting, the <em>de re</em> vs. <em>de dicto</em>
distinction has been studied by <span class="citation">Horty and
Pacuit (2017)</span> and <span class="citation">van Benthem
(2001)</span>.</p>

<p>
In light of these considerations, many logics for defining strategies 
involve epistemic elements. It seems reasonable to demand that agents 
cannot base their choice of strategy on everything that has happened before, 
but only on what they know, i.e., their current information <span class="citation">(Pacuit, Parikh, &amp; Cogan 2006)</span>. The resulting 
<em>uniform strategies</em> <span class="citation">(Maubert 2014)</span>, can be
defined by the knowledge programs of <span class="citation">Fagin,
Halpern et al. (1997)</span>. Further restrictions are possible, for
instance granting agents limited memory that only reaches back a fixed
number of moves <span class="citation">(Gutierrez, Harrenstein, &amp;
Wooldridge 2015)</span>.</p>

<p>
The epistemic action language can express many further phenomena in
imperfect information games. The following game is an
illustration.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig11">
<img src="fig11.svg" alt="This is a game tree diagram. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 11.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig11" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
Once player <i>E</i> arrives at node <i>n</i>, she cannot discern that
actual situation from node \(n'\). However, <i>E</i> must have
possessed information earlier on that distinguishes <i>n</i> from
\(n'\): to arrive at <i>n</i>, she must have played <i>a</i> as her
first choice, while \(n'\) can only be reached after playing <i>b</i>.
Thus, <i>E</i> can only be uncertain between these two nodes if she
forgot about her own previous actions.</p>

<p>
The epistemic action language can distinguish between such scenarios
with memory loss and those without. The property of <em>Perfect
Recall</em> states that players retain full memory of all moves they
observed. This can be expressed by the following axiom scheme <span class="citation">(Halpern
&amp; Vardi 1986; Bonanno 2004)</span></p>

\[K_i[a]\varphi\rightarrow[a]K_i\varphi.\]

<p>
Also the converse of this scheme admits a natural interpretation:</p>

\[[a]K_i\varphi\rightarrow K_i[a]\varphi.\]

<p>
This <em>No Miracles</em> property expresses that players can only
learn by observing moves, not by any other methods extraneous to the
game.</p>

<p>
Of course, logic does not presuppose that all players have perfect
memory, or that they cannot pick up any information outside the
progression of play. Epistemic action language can equally well be
employed to analyze more general scenarios where the above axioms do
not hold. Especially within dynamic-epistemic versions, epistemic
logics can produce modified versions that cover many more cases than
those described here <span class="citation">(van Benthem 2014)</span>.
Moreover, further modalities from epistemic logic make sense, in
particular, those for common or distributed knowledge in groups of
players <span class="citation">(Fagin, Halpern et al. 1995; Meyer
&amp; van der Hoek 1995)</span>.</p>

<p>
An epistemic component with operators \(K_i\) fits with many logical
perspectives on games. In particular, epistemic extensions are as
compatible with coarse logics such as the earlier-mentioned
\([\move_i]\)-setting with a single move-modality per player, as with
fine logics where each individual action type is represent by a
distinct modality \([a]\). In fact, in
 <a href="#LogicStrategicGames">Section 2.6</a>,
 epistemic operators were used for analyzing games in strategic form,
where modalities naturally relate to uncertainty about the other
players&rsquo; strategies.</p>

<h4 id="UnceAbouOptiPref">3.6.3 Uncertainty about options and preferences</h4>

<p>
In more general settings, uncertainty does not stop at the
opponents&rsquo; informational states. In international relations or
economic bargaining, also the players&rsquo; motivations and
preferences are not fully known to all parties involved. Within the
corresponding extended form games, players may be uncertain about
their opponents&rsquo; preferences and strategic options, whether they
can afford a certain move or whether they actually possess the
information they threatened to reveal. Obviously, uncertainty about
preferences or available options will impact reasoning about the
equilibria of a game. Strategic players might even try to exploit such
uncertainties, for instance by pretending to have options they do not
possess.</p>

<p>
In a first pass, this type of uncertainty can be expressed by
introducing nature as hypothetical player, with a first move that
determines the preferences and available options for all players. A
simple example is the game depicted below. At the start, <i>A</i> is
uncertain whether <i>E</i> can reply to <i>A</i>&rsquo;s move <i>f</i>
by playing <i>e</i>. Likewise, she lacks information on whether
<i>E</i> prefers \(O_3\) over \(O_4\), or vice versa.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig12">

 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig12" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
From a logical point of view, this miraculous initial move by Nature
is not needed. Standard epistemic models can represent the above
scenario, and many more complex ones, by means of the
indistinguishability relations introduced above. Technically, this
requires to move beyond standard imperfect information trees to
so-called <em>epistemic forests</em> <span class="citation">(van
Benthem, Gerbrandy, Hoshi, &amp; Pacuit 2009)</span>, sets of trees
linked by epistemic relations. In particular, the above game tree
transforms into</p>

 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig13" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
The epistemic action language for trees works just as well on
epistemic forests. However, in suitably expressive languages, the
logic of forests is weaker than that of trees, as the set of
validities on the class of <i>n</i>-player trees is a strict superset
of the validities on <i>n</i>-player forests.</p>

<div id="subsect:belief">

<h4 id="ImpeInfoBeli">3.6.4 Imperfect information and beliefs</h4>

<p>
Further enrichments of the logical framework add semantic structure to
the agents&rsquo; uncertainty. When unable to determine the exact
situation, players may classify options with respect to plausibility.
To this end, epistemic models have been equipped with plausibility
orderings \(\geq_i\) for players <i>i</i> <span class="citation">(Boutilier
1994; Stalnaker 1968; Baltag &amp; Smets
2008)</span>.</p>

<p>
In the preceding example, plausibility order might work as
follows:</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig14">
<img src="fig14.svg" alt="This has two game tree diagrams. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 14.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig14" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
This richer structure is reflected by introducing new modalities for
agents&rsquo; beliefs, determined by the most plausible states:</p>

<p class="center">
\(\mathcal{M},w\vDash B_i^{\phantom{\psi}}\varphi\quad\)
\(\varphi\) holds in all \(\geq_i\)-maximal states in <i>i</i>&rsquo;s epistemic
range.</p>

<p>
Conditional belief, important to players&rsquo; planning within a
game, can be interpreted in the same style:</p>

<p class="center">
\(\mathcal{M},w\vDash B_i^\psi\varphi\quad\) \(\varphi\) holds in all
\(\geq_i\)-maximal \(\psi\)-states in <i>i</i>&rsquo;s epistemic
range.</p>

<p>
These clauses are intended to work in finite as well as in infinite
settings. However, in the latter case minor modifications might be
needed akin to those in
 <a href="../logic-conditionals/index.html">conditional logic</a>.
 These have been proposed in various alternatives. Notably, this
enriched epistemic-doxastic logic allows for further, less standard
interpretations beyond those illustrated so far. Examples are
&lsquo;strong belief&rsquo;, expressing that all relevant
\(\varphi\)-states are more plausible than all relevant
\(\neg\varphi\) states, or &lsquo;safe belief&rsquo; saying that
\(\varphi\) holds at all states that are at least as plausible as the
current one. See <span class="citation">van Benthem and Smets
(2015)</span> for an overview of plausibility semantics and its
connections to conditional logic, belief revision theory,
dynamic-epistemic logic, and a wide range of philosophical and
technical issues.</p>
</div>

<div id="section:typespaces">

<h3 id="HighOrdeUnceTypeSpac">3.7 Higher Order Uncertainty and Type Spaces</h3>

<p>
In various scenarios, agents reason not only about the
opponents&rsquo; preferences or admissible moves, but also about their
beliefs about the game and others&rsquo; behavior therein. In fact,
such higher-order reasoning can have a major impact on game play. A
prime example is the Backward Induction procedure of
 <a href="#sec:BIstatic">Section 3.3</a>,
 where the construction of a best move relation crucially relied on
common knowledge of rationality. More generally, agent&rsquo;s best
moves frequently depend upon what they expect others to do. This
phenomenon is especially prominent for simultaneous move games, where
it occurs in both coordinative scenarios <span class="citation">(Skyrms
2003; Lewis 2002)</span> as well as
competitive ones <span class="citation">(Hotelling 1929)</span>. More
details can be found in the entry on
 <a href="../epistemic-game/index.html">epistemic game theory</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Arbitrary first and higher order levels of knowledge and belief can be
represented with the above relational models, the standard tool in
 <a href="../logic-epistemic/index.html">epistemic</a>
 and doxastic logic. For information in extensive form games, the
epistemic-doxastic perspective on states can be combined with
\(\move\)-relations in exactly the way described before. The result
are <em>epistemic-doxastic trees</em> or <em>forests</em> that can
represent most types of knowledge or belief players might have about
the game, including its exact shape, previous moves, opponents&rsquo;
preferences or opponents&rsquo; first- and higher-order beliefs on any
of these matters.</p>

<p>
Outside of logic, higher-order information has also been modeled in
classical game theory. Quantitative frameworks represent information
as probability distributions over a given event space. In this
setting, higher-order information corresponds to probability
distributions over probability distributions of the right kind. More
specifically, \(n^{\textrm{th}}\) order information corresponds to a
probability distribution over the space of \((n-1)^{\textrm{th}}\)
order beliefs. As shown by <span class="citation">Harsanyi
(1967&ndash;1968)</span>, the limit of specifying higher and higher
levels of information can be represented as a type space, where each
agents&rsquo; type is a probability distribution over states of nature
and the other players&rsquo; types. In an abstract sense to be
discussed below, these types correspond to states in standard models
of modal logic.</p>

<p>
In addition to standard modal models, logic also has a straightforward
analogue to probabilistic type spaces: <em>logical type spaces.</em>
In a formal framework first introduced by <span class="citation">Fagin,
Geanakoplos et al. (1999)</span>, an
<i>n</i>-type is a sequence \(\mathfrak{f}_n=\langle
f_0,f_1\ldots,f_{n}\rangle\) where \(f_0\) specifies the state of
nature, i.e., a valuation recording which atomic propositions are true
or false, and \(f_1\) lists for all players the states of nature they
consider possible. \(f_m\) for \(m\geq 0\) then specifies for all
players which \((m-1)\)-types, i.e., sequences \(\langle
g_0,\ldots,g_{m-1}\rangle\) they consider possible. In this way, an
<i>n</i>-type fixes the player&rsquo;s higher-order beliefs up to
level <i>n</i>. These types are, of course, subject to coherence
conditions: the agents&rsquo; <i>k</i>-types for different <i>k</i>
must fit together. For instance, whenever some agent considers a
<i>k</i>-type \(\mathfrak{f}_k\) possible, she must also consider any
initial segment \(\mathfrak{f}_{k'}\) for \(k'&lt;k\) possible.
Conversely, any \(k'\) type the agent considers must be the initial
segment of <em>some</em> <i>k</i> type the agent holds possible. Type
spaces offer a semantics for the epistemic language: Inductively, for
a formula \(\varphi\) of modal depth <i>m</i>, \(K_i\varphi\) is true
at a type \(\mathfrak{f}_n\) if all \(g_{m}\in f_{m+1}(i)\) satisfy
\(\varphi\) or if \(m&gt;n\).</p>

<p>
Alternatively, the set of <i>n</i>-types allows for a natural
interpretation as relational models with accessibility relations
defined by</p>

<p class="center">
\(\langle f_0,\ldots f_n\rangle R_i\langle g_0,\ldots g_n\rangle\quad\)
For all \(m\leq n\) holds \(g_{m-1}\in f_m(i)\)</p>

<p>
Interpreting the set of <i>n</i>-types as a relational model yields a
second way of evaluating the epistemic language on logical type
spaces. For formulas of modal depth less than <i>n</i> the two
interpretations coincide. Hence, up to finite depths, type spaces and
their associated relational models are two perspectives on the same
informational situation.</p>

<p>
To fix all of the agents&rsquo; beliefs, the analysis moves to types
\(\mathfrak{f}=\langle f_0,f_1,\ldots\rangle\), containing some
\(f_n\) for every natural number <i>n</i>. In this extended framework
the situation becomes more complicated. The space of all such types is
universal in the following sense: every relational model can be mapped
in a truth-preserving manner to the space of all types by sending each
state to a full description of the agents&rsquo; corresponding first-
and higher-order informational attitudes. This map, however, is
usually not a modal bisimulation. In fact, the process of type
construction could be continued indefinitely, yielding a transfinite
hierarchy of mutually non-bisimilar type spaces <span class="citation">(Heifetz
&amp; Samet 1998)</span>. Such transfinite
types can become relevant when the epistemic language is enriched with
modalities for common group knowledge, in which case a full
description of all expressible attitudes involves infinite hierarchies
of higher-order information <span class="citation">(Fagin, Geanakoplos
et al. 1999)</span>. A recent logical study of type spaces including
their probabilistic structure can be found in <span class="citation">Bjorndahl
and Halpern (2017)</span>.</p>

<p>
The tight connection between type spaces and relational models is
compatible with additional assumptions that might be imposed on the
players&rsquo; mental states. <span class="citation">Fagin,
Geanakoplos et al. (1999)</span> characterizes when type spaces give
rise to \(S5\) models, while <span class="citation">Galeazzi &amp;
Lorini (2016)</span> do the same for multi-agent <em>KD45</em>
belief.</p>

<p>
While relational models and logical type spaces represent exactly the
same information, their main differences is in perspective. Relational
models take a third person bird&rsquo;s eye view on possible worlds.
Their starting point is a set of worlds rich enough to contain all
states considered possible by the relevant agents, together with
accessibility relations modeling players&rsquo; information. From
there, agents&rsquo; first-order beliefs at the various worlds can be
read off and, subsequently, also all higher levels of information.
<em>Logical type spaces</em>, by contrast, assume a first person
perspective. They take a full description of first and higher-order
beliefs as primitive and treat indistinguishability as a derived
relation.</p>

<p>
Finally, it should be noted that type spaces assume a static
perspective on games. No provisions are taken for representing moves
or strategies explicitly, nor for incorporating updates of knowledge
and belief that occur as a game in extensive form unfolds, cf. the
discussion in
 <a href="#section:play">Section 4</a>.
 Thus, there is some distance between type spaces and the earlier
epistemic-doxastic forest models for extensive games. As a first step
towards filling this gap, it has been shown how type spaces can
accommodate product updates from dynamic epistemic logic <span class="citation">(Klein
&amp; Pacuit 2014)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="ReasBounAgenPlayType">3.8 Reasoning, Bounded Agency, and Player Types</h3>

<p>
Besides variations in preferences and beliefs, a third crucial aspect
of players is their styles of information processing, decision making,
and reasoning. Real cognitive agents are bounded in their information
processing, as both their memory and reasoning capacities are limited.
In particular, players may not be able to represent the entire game
they are in, nor reason until the end of the game. This phenomenon of
<em>short sight</em> has been studied in <span class="citation">Grossi
and Turrini (2012)</span> and <span class="citation">Turrini
(2016)</span>. Moreover, in real-life iterated social interaction,
payoffs are generated along the game, and may not be clear beforehand,
<span class="citation">(Axelrod &amp; Hamilton 1981)</span>. In such
contexts, the best strategy in terms of short-term payoffs need not be
optimal in the long run, but bounded agents may miss this longer
horizon, <span class="citation">(Klein, Marx, &amp; Scheller
forthcoming)</span>.</p>

<p>
Logical literature on bounded agency is too broad to be surveyed here.
For a few research lines relevant to games, see <span class="citation">Fagin
and Halpern (1987) and Heifetz, Meier, and
Schipper (2006)</span> on epistemic logics with awareness, <span class="citation">Artemov
(2008)</span> on
 <a href="../logic-justification/index.html">justification logics</a>,
 <span class="citation">van Benthem and Pacuit (2011)</span> on
evidence logics, and <span class="citation">Hansson (1998) and Lorini
(2018)</span> on doxastic logics with computationally tractable belief
bases.</p>

<p>
In the game theoretic literature, bounded agents have often been
represented as finite state machines <span class="citation">(Gutierrez,
Harrenstein, &amp; Wooldridge 2015;
Binmore &amp; Samuelson 1992)</span>. Limitations on reasoning
capacities or memory size then translate into bounds on the machine
size. The resulting hierarchy allows for a fine grained analysis of
information processing, reasoning, and thus bounded players of
different types. This perspective fits well with the logical study of
agency in computer science, <span class="citation">(Gr&auml;del,
Thomas, &amp; Wilke 2002; Wooldridge 2009)</span>.</p>

<p>
In an integrated perspective, preferences, beliefs and reasoning
styles can all be subsumed under the game-theoretic notion of a
<em>player type</em>. For reasoning about the future course of a game,
players will hence often entertain beliefs about each others&rsquo;
types. A simple example is Backward Induction, where players assume
all opponents fully rational throughout. In more complex settings,
individual actors may attempt to rationalize various moves observed
and derive predictions about their opponents&rsquo; future behavior by
taking a broader range of options into account. Such players may start
by assuming the counter-player to be a simple machine, and only move
up to more complex views when required by evidence. In particular,
there is no reason to assume uniformity of players or views. Within a
given scenario, a diversity of player types might be present <span class="citation">(Liu 2009; Liu
&amp; Wang 2013; Paul &amp; Ramanujam 2011;
Ghosh &amp; Verbrugge 2018; Bergwerff et al. 2014)</span>. For some
game-theoretic proposals concerning most frequently occurring player
types, see <span class="citation">Camerer (2003)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="ThinThicModeForPlay">3.9 Thin and Thick Models for Players</h3>

<p>
This section has outlined a variety of ways for incorporating players
and agency into game forms. These come in a hierarchy of richness,
ranging from annotated game trees to epistemic forests, type spaces,
or yet more abstract models of games.</p>

<p>
At the thinner end, the focus is on structural aspects of the game,
incorporating players&rsquo; preferences, but not necessarily their
beliefs. Such frameworks are typically just rich enough to represent
equilibria or backward induction paths, and to reason about these in
logics of action and preference. Thin models leave much information
about players&rsquo; knowledge, beliefs, or their <em>modus
operandi</em> unspecified, and put less emphasis on the actual
dynamics of game play.</p>

<p>
At the thicker end, models for games have lush worlds encoding
players&rsquo; preferences, information, beliefs, and perhaps even
their complete types, including memory and reasoning capacities.
Typical models of this kind are found in <span class="citation">Stalnaker
(1998)</span> and <span class="citation">Halpern
(2001)</span>. When applied to extensive
games rather than strategic-form games, thick models can anticipate
anything that can happen in one large temporal universe, allowing to
derive a full prediction about how play will proceed.</p>

<p>
The distinction between thick and thin logical models seems folklore
in applied logic. In fact, it occurred already in the
earlier-mentioned choice between local logics with single step
modalities versus temporal logics built over a complete universe of
histories. Yet, there does not seem to be a unique best perspective.
Rather, the choice between thick and thin models often depends on the
exact goals pursued. A central consideration in this trade off is
where the dynamics of stepwise play should be located: Thick models
pre-encoded such dynamics, whereas thin models allow for an external
dynamic logics for updates <span class="citation">(Baltag, Smets, and
Zvesper 2009)</span>. The next section will highlight a number of ways
for complementing a thin perspective with dynamic information on game
play through representations of actions and updates.</p>

<h3 id="SpecTopi_1">3.10 Special Topics</h3>

<p>
<span><strong>Deontic reasoning</strong></span> Preference is closely
related to obligation and permission. This shows in particular on the
formal side, where preference logic in both static and dynamic
variants <span class="citation">(Hansson 1990; van Benthem, Grossi,
&amp; Liu 2014)</span> has clear analogies with
 <a href="../logic-deontic/index.html">deontic logic</a>.
 Moreover, deontic and game-theoretic perspectives have given rise to
many fruitful connections. In one direction, deontic notions may be
seen as high-level descriptions of optimal actions given the
information and obligations of agents <span class="citation">(Kooi
&amp; Tamminga 2008; Anglberger, Gratzl, &amp; Roy 2015)</span>.
Conversely, game solution procedures can enrich accounts of deontic
notions <span class="citation">(Ba&#351;kent, Loohuis and Parikh 2012; Horty 2018)</span>.
Lastly, in artificial intelligence, deontic perspectives arise in
tracking the behavior of a distributed system in relation to its
goals, <span class="citation">(&Aring;gotnes &amp; Wooldridge
2010)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Mathematical foundations</strong></span> Incorporating
players raises new questions about game equivalence. When agency
matters, adequate notions of equivalence cannot stop at preserving
properties of the underlying game form. Rather, <em>player-dependent
equivalences</em> will also require preservation of players&rsquo;
beliefs, preferences or reasoning types. Incorporating such additional
parameters makes it harder for two games to be equivalent, as new
space for variation comes into play. On the other hand, agent
limitations might also create new simpler game equivalences that can
be studied by the tools of this entry.</p>

<div id="section:play">

<h2 id="AnalPlay">4. Analyzing Play</h2>

<p>
The term &lsquo;game theory&rsquo; suggests that everything of
interest is captured in the format of a game with its moves and
outcomes. The present entry reassembles this perspective, considering
additional structure. A first extension was offered in
 <a href="#natplayers">Section 3</a>,
 treating the nature of players as a topic in its own right. This
sections puts a spotlight on a second topic, game play in a wider
sense.</p>

<p>
Many themes in the literature on logic and games fall into three
phases connected to play. Certain activities can already be conducted
<em>before</em> the actual game. Examples are assessing the opponent
or forming a plan. Most relevant choices and decisions, however, take
place <em>during</em> the game - at least unless one thinks of players
as automata blindly following preset strategies. Lastly, also
<em>after</em> a game significant activities occur. These involve
learning about opponent types, identifying crucial mistakes made, or
rationalizing the moves taken. In what follows, examples will be
presented of each phase.</p>

<h3 id="GameSoluPregDeli">4.1 Game Solution and Pregame Deliberation</h3>

<p>
When viewing games as static structures, rationality can be defined in
terms of coherence between players&rsquo;
 <a href="../decision-theory/index.html">beliefs, preferences and choices or intentions</a>
 <span class="citation">(Elster 1988)</span>. However, rationality
also describes a quality of behavior, related to how players act or
what they take advantage of when deliberating about a game. The
relation between both perspectives can be made concrete when
interpreting game solution procedures as styles of pregame
deliberation. To follow is a dynamic analysis of Backward Induction
(cf.
 <a href="#sec:BIstatic">Section 3.3</a>)
 that differs conceptually from
 <a href="../epistemic-game/index.html">characterization theorems</a>
 in terms of static properties such as common knowledge or common
belief. In the dynamic analysis, these group properties are not
assumed as preconditions. Rather, they are produced through the logic
of deliberation.</p>

<div id="BIPA">

<h4 id="BackInduViaPublAnno">4.1.1 Backward Induction via public announcement</h4>

<p>
The Backward Induction algorithm is usually presented in a
quantitative setting, where each outcome is associated with  utility values for all players. 
<span class="citation">(Leyton-Brown and Shoham 2008)</span>. However,
the same algorithm also works in a qualitative setting, with attitudes
expressed by a preference relation between outcomes.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Backward Induction</strong></span> Backward Induction
computes optimal moves for players. More specifically, at each choice
node of an extensive form game, one or more of the available moves is
labeled as optimal. For each player this set of optimal moves often
forms a strategy in the usual game-theoretic sense, i.e., a function
selecting a unique action to take at each of her choice nodes. Yet,
there are degenerate cases where backward induction merely creates a
relational strategy, restricting the available moves, while still
leaving some choices to the player.</p>

<p>
The principle driving the Backward Induction algorithm is that no
player should ever select a move that is dominated by another move
available at the same moment. Dominance here works in a recursive
manner. Move <i>a</i> dominates move <i>b</i> if the corresponding
player prefers each final outcome reachable from <i>a</i> by following
Backward Induction moves to every outcome reachable from <i>b</i> by
Backward Induction moves.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Public announcement of rationality</strong></span> In
one perspective, Backward Induction can be understood as a process of
prior-to-play deliberation, executed by players whose minds proceed in
harmony. Deliberation steps are repeated public announcements
(\(!\rat\)) of rationality-at-nodes:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">\(\rat \)</span><span class="sen">no player
arrived at the current node via a strictly dominated move </span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Dominance here is a relation between the outcomes available after a
certain move has been made. In one interpretation, some move <i>a</i>
dominates another move <i>b</i> if every outcome that remains
obtainable after <i>a</i> is preferred to any outcome reachable after
a <i>b</i> move. However, there is a dynamic twist: crucially, the
game tree considered, and hence the outcomes available, changes during
the deliberation procedure.</p>

<p>
The semantics of
 <a href="../dynamic-epistemic/index.html">announcement updates</a>
 works by trimming models. \(!\varphi\) transforms a model <i>M</i>
into a sub-model \(M_{|\varphi}\) consisting of all those points in
<i>M</i> that satisfy \(\varphi\), while deleting all \(\neg\varphi\)
nodes. Relations on \(M_{|\varphi}\) are those inherited from
<i>M</i>. Crucially, deletion may change the truth value of formulas:
after announcing \(!\varphi\), some nodes in \(M_{|\varphi}\) may
satisfy \(\neg\varphi\). In particular, with <i>M</i> the set of
points in a game tree, the set of available histories may keep
shrinking as successive announcements are made. Hence, repeated
announcements of \(!\rat \) make sense. In finite games, this process
always reaches a limit, a smallest subgame where no move is dominated
by another.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Solving games through iterated
assertions of rationality.</p>

<p>
Consider the following game, already introduced in
 <a href="#exIntro">Section 1.1</a>.
 Iterated announcements of \(!\rat \) removes nodes that can only be
reached by dominated moves as long as this can be done. The trace of
this procedure is:</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig15">
<img src="fig15.svg" alt="This has three game tree diagrams illustrating the example. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 15.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig15" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
Here, the Backward Induction solution emerges step by step. Stage 1 of
the procedure rules out the leaf labeled with (\(2,2\)) as the only
point where \(\rat \) fails. Stage 2 then rules out <i>E</i>&rsquo;s
choice node as new node where \(\rat\) fails. In the resulting game
tree, \(\rat \) holds throughout.</p>

<p>
More generally, let \((!\varphi, M)^\#\) be the limit (i.e., the first
fixed point) of <i>M</i> under repeatedly announcing \(\varphi\) as
long as it still true. In any game tree, the fixed-point \((!\rat ,
M)^\#\) has \(\rat\) true throughout. Its nodes contain the actual
play computed by the Backward Induction algorithm <span class="citation">(van
Benthem 2014)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Limit behavior</strong></span> Rationality is
&lsquo;self-fulfilling&rsquo; in the limit: if players commit to it in
deliberation for long enough, they prune away all irrational moves
and, <em>a fortiori</em>, all moves incompatible with common belief of
rationality. The final outcome is a model with rational play at every
point, a form of common knowledge of rationality. However, iterated
announcements can also yield a different type of limit behavior:
self-refutation. A prime example for this is the classic Muddy
Children puzzle <span class="citation">(Gierasimczuk &amp; Szymanik
2011)</span> where repeatedly communicating ignorance leads to
knowledge in the end. Also within game theory, a number of situations
exist where (credible) announcements of future irrationality can leave
some player better off than the Backward Induction solution <span class="citation">(Leyton-Brown
&amp; Shoham 2008)</span>.</p>
</div>

<div id="BIBR">

<h4 id="BackInduViaBeliRevi">4.1.2 Backward Induction via belief revision</h4>

<p>
<span><strong>Iterated belief revision.</strong></span> A different
perspective of pre-game deliberation is couched in terms of belief
instead of knowledge. The driving force here is
rationality-in-belief:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">\(\rat ^*\)</span><span class="sen">players
never chose any move dominated by another in light of their beliefs
how play will proceed from then on.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
In this setting, the game tree itself remains invariant during
deliberation: no histories are removed or ruled out. What may change instead 
is the relative plausibility of occurrence players assign to end nodes
or, in infinite games, histories.</p>

<p>
In plausibility semantics (briefly introduced in
 <a href="#subsect:epistemic">Section 3.6</a>),
 an agent believes propositions that hold true in all those
epistemically accessible worlds that are maximal in her plausibility
order. The corresponding dynamics of deliberation does not proceed by
point deletion, but by <em>soft updates</em> modifying the
agents&rsquo; plausibility ordering. For Backward Induction, a
&lsquo;radical upgrade&rsquo; \(\Uparrow\varphi\) suffices, that moves
all \(\varphi\)-worlds above all \(\neg\varphi\)-worlds states while
maintaining the ordering within these two sets <span class="citation">(Baltag
&amp; Smets 2008)</span>.</p>

<p>
Here is how this mechanism works in a game setting. Start with all end
nodes equiplausible for all players. Since upgrades proceed by public
announcement, all players will share the same beliefs throughout. In
the procedure to follow, a move <i>x</i> is <em>dominated in
belief</em> by a move <i>y</i> of the same choice node if, in the
acting agent&rsquo;s plausibility ordering, the most plausible end
nodes reachable after <i>y</i> are all better for her than each most
plausible end node compatible with move <i>x</i>. Now perform radical
upgrades of type</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li><span class="tag">\(\Uparrow\rat ^*\)</span><span class="sen">If
<i>y</i> is dominated in belief by <i>x</i>, make all end nodes
following <i>x</i> more plausible than those after
<i>y</i>.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Backward Induction, soft
version.</p>

<p>
Here are the stages for the new procedure in the preceding example,
where the letters \(x, y, z\) stand for end nodes or histories of the
game:</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig16">
<img src="fig16.svg" alt="This has three game tree diagrams illustrating the example. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 16.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig16" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
In the top node of the leftmost tree, going right is not dominated in
beliefs for player <i>A</i> by going left. So, \(\rat ^*\) only
affects <i>E</i>&rsquo;s turn, and radical upgrade with \(\Uparrow\rat
^*\) makes \((0, 3)\) more plausible than \((2,2)\) . After this
change, going right has become dominated in beliefs in the top node,
and a new upgrade takes place, making <i>A</i>&rsquo;s going left most
plausible.</p>

<p>
Iterated upgrade with \(\rat ^*\) always stabilizes to a fixed
plausibility order, which is the same for all players. Identifying
each history of a game with its end node allows for a belief analysis
of Backward Induction <span class="citation">(van Benthem &amp;
Gheerbrant 2010)</span>. On finite trees, the histories emerging when
all players resort to their Backward Induction strategies exactly
correspond to the most plausible end nodes created by iterated radical
upgrade with rationality-in-belief. An alternative dynamic-epistemic
characterization of Backward Induction, using similar ideas in a
different mix, can be found in <span class="citation">Baltag, Smets,
and Zvesper (2009)</span>.</p>

<p>
Stabilization cannot be taken for granted. For other assertions
\(\varphi\), iterated upgrades \(\Uparrow\varphi\) can lead to
oscillating or divergent plausibility orders. However, this divergence
is limited. While cycles can occur for conditional beliefs, every
truthful iterated sequence of radical upgrades eventually stabilizes
all propositional beliefs <span class="citation">(Baltag &amp; Smets
2009)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Fixed-point logic</strong></span> In a more technical
perspective, Backward Induction strategies can be defined as largest
subrelation of the total \(\move\) relation that has at least one
successor at each non-terminal node, while satisfying a confluence
property between action and preference:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="sentag tag6em">

<li><span class="tag">\(CF(s)\)</span><span class="sen">\(\forall
x\forall y(( \turn_i(x)\land xsy)\rightarrow\forall z (x\, \move\,
z\rightarrow\) \(\exists u\exists v(\sfend(u)\land \sfend(v)\land y
s^* v\land z s^* u\land u\leq_i v)))\)</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
This fact is the basis for proving that Backward Induction is
definable in First Order Fix point logic <em>LFP(FFO)</em> <span class="citation">(van
Benthem &amp; Gheerbrant 2010)</span>. Results
in this line of research connect game solution and game-theoretic
equilibria with fixed-point logics of computation. In simple settings,
such as that of Zermelo&rsquo;s Theorem mentioned earlier, modal
fixed-point logics akin to &mu;-calculus suffice.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="IterRemoStriDomiStra">4.1.3 Iterated removal of strictly dominated strategies</h4>

<p>
Further game solution concepts can be analyzed with logics of iterated
update. In particular, iterated updates are not restricted to
extensive form games, but can also provide insights for games in
strategic form. A paradigmatic algorithm is Iterated Removal of
Strictly Dominated Strategies \((SD^\infty)\). In this setting, a
strategy is considered dominated if there exists another strategy that
yields a strictly higher payoff against any of the opponent&rsquo;s
actions.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Iterated removal of strictly
dominated strategies \((SD^\infty)\).</p>

<p>
Consider the following matrix. As usual, pairs list <i>A</i>&rsquo;s
utility first, <i>E</i>&rsquo;s second.</p>

<table class="cell-center centered avoid-break cellpad-small-dense inner-rules">
<tr>

  <td style="border: 1px solid black">0, 1 </td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">1, 4</td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">2, 0</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
First remove the right-hand column, i.e., <i>E</i>&rsquo;s action
<i>c</i> which is dominated by either of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. With <i>c</i>
being removed, <i>A</i>&rsquo;s action <i>f</i> has become strictly
dominated. After its removal, <i>E</i>&rsquo;s action <i>b</i> becomes
strictly dominated, and after that, <i>A</i>&rsquo;s action <i>e</i>.
At the end of the process, iterated removal leaves nothing but the
state \((d,a)\), the game&rsquo;s unique Nash equilibrium. In general,
the resulting game matrix after all removals is guaranteed to contain
all Nash equilibria of the original game, but it may also contain
further strategy combinations.</p>

<p>
In this setting, the formal dynamic apparatus involves assertions
appropriate to the matrix games of
 <a href="#gamestructures">Section 2</a>.
 In fact, various different types of rationality can be defined in
logics for matrix games. Here is an illustration for two-player games,
involving announcements of &lsquo;Weak Rationality&rsquo;:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li><span class="tag"><em>WR</em></span><span class="sen">Each player
thinks that, compared with each of her available alternative actions,
her current move might be at least as good for her.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
This statement is the negation, for each player, of her current action
being strongly dominated. Naturally, this property can be expressed
formally with suitable epistemic action modalities. Yet, even as it
stands, it is clear that Weak Rationality can be announced to prune
away strategy profiles, and that in a iterated manner. The strategic
game will change every time weak rationality is announced, initiating
a stepwise process that resembles the earlier iterative announcements
of rationality for Backward Induction. As observed there, limits of
public announcements are always reached eventually, as models can only
get smaller. For announcing Weak Rationality, these limits match the
outcome of \(SD^\infty\) precisely <span class="citation">(van Benthem
2007)</span>.</p>

<p>
A similar style of analysis can be extended to other notions of
rationality. For instance, taking \(B_i\) to stand for &lsquo;the
current action of player <i>i</i> is best for her against all actions
of the opponent&rsquo;, the following formula may be dubbed strong
rationality <em>SR</em></p> 

\[\langle E\rangle B_E\land \langle A\rangle B_A\]

<p>
Briefly, the formula expresses that both players have a reasonable
hope of doing well. <em>Strong Rationality</em> in this sense is
related to the rationalizability program for game solution <span class="citation">(Pearce
1964; de Bruin 2005)</span>, where actions
are discarded if a better response exists under all circumstances.
Strong Rationality, too, drives a game solution method.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Updates with iterated
announcements of strong rationality (<em>SR</em>).</p>

<p>
Consider a slight variation on the previous example. Below is the
sequence of updates for iterated announcements of strong rationality
\((\textit{SR}^\omega)\)</p>

<p>
Each box may be viewed as an epistemic game model, as explained
earlier. Again, every step of announcement increases players&rsquo;
knowledge, until a fixed-point is reached, constituting an equilibrium
where each player knows as much as they can.</p>

<p>
Strong rationality is a more demanding condition than weak
rationality. While <em>SR</em> implies <em>WR</em>, there can be moves
that satisfy weak but not strong rationality. This shows in the
following difference between the current and the previous example. In the present matrix,
announcing Weak Rationality stops after the first step elimination of
action <i>c</i>. The reason is that, in the second matrix, the row
player&rsquo;s bottom move is not strictly dominated by any other
action, so this row remains after re-announcing <em>WR</em>. However,
under no possible circumstance is the row player&rsquo;s bottom action
best for her. This contradicts strong rationality and hence that row
is eliminated by the next <em>SR</em> announcement. More generally,
the game matrix resulting from \((\textit{SR})^\infty\) is a
sub-matrix of that produced by \((\textit{WR})^\infty\). Notably, this
is not entirely obvious, as the two update sequences may produce
different epistemic models satisfying different formulas. A proof can
be found in <span class="citation">van Benthem (2014)</span>.</p>

<p>
Just as with Backward Induction, there are connections between
iterated announcements and fixed-point logics. The set of strategy
profiles that survive iterated announcements of strong rationality can
be defined in modal &mu;-calculi <span class="citation">(Kozen 1983;
Venema 2008)</span>. If announcements are generalized to arbitrary
formulas, so-called deflationary fixed-point logics are needed for
studying limit behavior <span class="citation">(Ebbinghaus &amp; Flum
1995; Dawar, Gr&auml;del, &amp; Kreutzer 2004)</span>.</p>

<p>
Further game solution concepts have been analyzed in a similar dynamic
update style. The iterated regret minimization of <span class="citation">Halpern
and Pass (2012)</span>, for instance, has
been captured in terms of iterated announcements <span class="citation">(Bobbio
&amp; Cio 2018)</span>.</p>

<p>
It should be noted, that there are also more deductive takes on
solution concepts, where successive inferences assume the role of the
semantic updates above. A systematic proof-theoretic perspective on
game-theoretic reasoning toward solution can be found in <span class="citation">de
Bruin (2005)</span>. Lastly, alternative analyses
of Strong and Weak Rationality as well as other game solution
concepts, in an abstract rewriting format of computational logic can
be found in <span class="citation">Apt (2005)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Digression: comparing across representation
levels</strong></span> Different iterative announcement procedures
lead to different analyses of games. Moreover when comparing various
procedures across different frameworks, surprises may occur. For an
illustration, take Backward Induction. Its dynamic analysis produced a
new &lsquo;best move&rsquo; relation or plausibility order on an
extensive form game. The resulting strategy profiles may differ from a
Nash equilibrium analysis of the associated strategic form game:</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Backward Induction and Nash
equilibria.</p>

<p>
Consider the following game. <i>E</i> has no preferences between any
outcomes, but <i>A</i> does, as marked by the utility values.
<br />
</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig17">

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 17.</span> 
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig17" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
In the earlier BI analysis, neither move for <i>A</i> dominates the
other in beliefs, so no move is eliminated. Now consider the two
possible strategy profiles of each player and compute Nash
equilibria:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
(<em>Left, right</em>) is not a Nash equilibrium, since <i>A</i> would
do better by playing <em>Right</em>, but <em>(Left, left)</em> is.</p>
</div>

<p>
This illustrates differences in logical perspective on strategic and
extensive form games. Primitive elements of the former, strategies,
are complex objects in the latter&rsquo;s game tree that cannot be
identified completely at the level of individual nodes alone. A
related point of connecting perspectives in classic game theory gave
rise to the concept of subgame perfect Nash equilibria <span class="citation">(Selten
1975)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Further scenarios</strong></span> Casting game solution
in terms of deliberation renders it an internal mental process:
normally opponents do not sit down together to discuss their game play
in advance, but reason about the opponents&rsquo; possible actions and
considerations. However, the deliberative techniques introduced above
also apply to real conversational scenarios. An example related to
game theory is the topic of disagreement, first introduced in an
epistemic setting by <span class="citation">Aumann</span>&rsquo;s
<span class="citation">1976</span> seminal agreeing to disagree
result. <span class="citation">D&eacute;gremont and Roy (2012)</span>
investigate this topic with techniques of dynamic logic, building on
classical results from <span class="citation">Geanakoplos and
Polemarchakis (1982)</span>. In this framework, any dialogue where
agents keep stating whether or not they believe some formula
\(\varphi\) leads to agreement in the limit model, where updates no
longer have any effect. Briefly said, agents cannot disagree forever,
at least when starting with different hard information, while sharing
a well-founded plausibility order.</p>

<div id="sec:beliefplay">

<h3 id="InfoFlowKnowBeliDuriPlay">4.2 Information Flow, Knowledge, and Belief During Play</h3>

<p>
Game play is a dynamic process, where players repeatedly obtain new
information about other players. Certain aspects of information
collection are hard-wired into the game&rsquo;s structure, such as
observing moves, or, in settings of imperfect observation, changing
from one information state to another. Other updates may be
extraneous, such as signals about the type of opponent one is dealing
with. As of now, there is no general logical theory encompassing all
these phenomena. Yet, instructive samples exist. The first topic to
address concerns the players&rsquo; knowledge, the second their
belief.</p>

<h4 id="EpisUpdaImpeInfo">4.2.1 Epistemic update and imperfect information</h4>

<p>
In one perspective, games annotated with imperfect information cells
can be interpreted as recording a process of actual play. However, an
imperfect information tree does not suffice to fully specify the trace
of a real game. This raises the question on how to tease out what has
really happened. One style of analysis involves techniques from
 <a href="../dynamic-epistemic/index.html">dynamic-epistemic logic</a>.
 In this approach, players are assumed to have perfect recall, they do
not forget anything they once knew, while also satisfying No Miracles:
observation of actual game play is their only source of information,
(cf.
 <a href="#subsect:epistemic">Section 3.6</a>).</p>
 
<p>
In a first approximation, every move triggers a public announcement,
informing all players what just happened. Many games, however, include
partially observable moves, where some players merely learn that an
act has been performed, but not necessarily which. In this case,
information processing requires <em>product updates</em> from
dynamic-epistemic logic <span class="citation">(cf.
Baltag &amp; Moss
2004)</span>, allowing for an appropriate mixture of
knowledge and uncertainty.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Decorating a game tree by
updates.</p>

<p>
The left-hand side of the following diagram displays the game&rsquo;s
bare action structure, without any information on observability.
However, when moving, players can distinguish their own actions, but
not all moves of their opponents. Their precise observational powers
are described by <em>event models</em> for the individual moves <span class="citation">(cf.
van Ditmarsch, van der Hoek, &amp; Kooi
2007)</span>.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig18">
<img src="fig18.svg" alt="This is a game tree diagram and an Event Model illustrating the example. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 18.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig18" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
The observational structure on possible moves is encoded by relations
between the corresponding nodes, as described for games of imperfect
information
 (<a href="#subsect:epistemic">Section 3.6</a>).
 Here are the successive updates that create the uncertainty links in
the tree:</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig19">
<img src="fig19.svg" alt="This three diagrams representing the updates. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 19.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig19" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
The resulting annotated tree is the following imperfect information
game:</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig20">
<img src="fig20.svg" alt="This is a game tree diagram illustrating the example. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 20.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig20" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
A similar analysis applies to infinite trees as well as to epistemic
forests (cf.
 <a href="#subsect:epistemic">Section 3.6</a>).
 More generally, any imperfect information structure can arise from
information updates, provided players satisfy perfect recall and no
miracles, and moves in the game have logically definable preconditions
governing their availability. Precise formulations and proofs can be
found in <span class="citation">van Benthem, Gerbrandy, Hoshi, and
Pacuit (2009)</span>. A generalization to game play without assumption
of synchronicity is provided in <span class="citation">D&eacute;gremont,
L&ouml;we, and Witzel
(2011)</span>.</p>

<p>
No miracles and perfect recall are typical assumptions for most types
of agents in game theory. However, certain scenarios require
modifications, (cf. <span class="citation">Osborne &amp; Rubinstein
1994</span> on the &lsquo;drunken driver&rsquo; scenario). Moreover,
if players are represented as finite automata, (cf.
 <a href="#BoundedAgt">Section 3.8</a>),
 perfect recall fails, and quite different patterns of uncertainty
become possible. Characterizations results for memory-free and
memory-bounded players can be found in <span class="citation">Liu
(2011)</span>.</p>

<p>
In addition to observational restrictions built into the game setup,
product updates can also model extraneous communication or other
information flow parallel to actual play. Some such scenarios will be
listed under Further Directions below.</p>

<h4 id="BeliReviForwIndu">4.2.2 Belief revision and Forward Induction</h4>

<p>
Certain types of information may be judged inconclusive or not fully
reliable. While unsuitable for advancing knowledge, such information
may prompt agents to alter some of their beliefs. Such inconclusive
evidence often concerns expectations concerning opponents&rsquo;
player types. Leaving aside the possibility of mere mistakes, all
moves can be assumed to result from intentional, strategic
considerations. By interpreting opponents&rsquo; past moves, agents
may hence infer about their beliefs, preferences, risk attitudes or
reasoning types. Naturally, most such observations are not fully
conclusive. The corresponding updates hence cannot delete any
alternatives. Rather, they merely change the agent&rsquo;s
plausibility ordering \(\leq_i\) among different options. Formally,
this can be handled with the plausibility updates introduced for
Backward Induction. However, the interpretation differs. Here, these
updates do not represent steps in pregame deliberation, but result
from actual moves during the game. Besides the radical upgrade
introduced above, a number of further updating policies reflecting
different attitudes to the information acquired are defined in <span class="citation">Baltag
and Smets (2008)</span>. The
epistemic-plausibility patterns that can arise from systematic
plausibility update in games have been identified in <span class="citation">D&eacute;gremont
(2010)</span>, using two
counterparts of the earlier perfect recall and no miracles properties:
&lsquo;Plausibility Revelation&rsquo; and &lsquo;Plausibility
Propagation&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
These results refer to but one aspect of belief in games. There are
others. A further type of belief describes agents prior attitudes to
the game, generated by past experience or deliberation. Another refers
to the agents&rsquo; beliefs about where they are located in the game
tree, based on previous observations during play. To keep these
notions separate, one might distinguish between more local
&lsquo;beliefs&rsquo; during play and future-oriented
&lsquo;expectations&rsquo; about the game&rsquo;s progression.
Plausibility orders created by Backward Induction, for instance,
describe expectations about future game play. These are not based on
observations already made in the present game, and significantly, fail
to satisfy the properties of plausibility revelation and propagation.
Here is a particular strand of logical belief and its revision that is
of independent game-theoretic interest.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Forward Induction</strong></span> Suppose some player
has deviated from her Backward Induction strategy as computed in
pre-game deliberation. What are others to make of this? Answers
offered in the literature range from interpreting the deviation as an
error without any future implications <span class="citation">(Aumann
1995)</span> to treating it as significant in various ways <span class="citation">(Bicchieri
1993)</span>. In the latter vein, the
deviation could be a signal for cooperation (believable or not), a
sign of limited resources, or it could reveal other relevant
information about the player&rsquo;s type.</p>

<p>
More explicitly, the situation has the following aspects. At any stage
of a game, players have several types of information, including their
prior expectations of how the game would proceed and the perhaps
surprising observations made along the way. If the game is to continue
further, as in the state marked below, agents need to integrate both
into expectations about the future course of the game.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig21">
<img src="fig21.svg" alt="This is a game tree diagram illustrating the previous paragraph. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 21.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig21" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
<span><strong>Rationalizing</strong></span> There is no unique best
way of integrating information of the various kinds. Yet, a natural
option is to maintain the assumption of opponents&rsquo; rationality,
taken in the earlier sense. Assuming preferences to be common
knowledge, observed moves hence provide new information about the
opponent&rsquo;s belief. More specifically, these beliefs have two
components: expectations about what other players will do, and
intentions about their own future actions. The driving principle will
then be</p>

<p class="center"><em>Rationalizing</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By playing a move, a rational player communicates that this move is
not strictly dominated-in-beliefs for her.</p>

<p>
Clearly, rationalizing can only be maintained as long as the player
does not choose a move that is strictly dominated under all
circumstances. In that case, one must ascend a ladder of further
hypotheses about the opponent, including the possibility of her making
mistakes.</p>

<p>
Reasoning policies of the above type are called <em>Forward
Induction</em>. <span>Battigalli and Siniscalchi (2002) and
Brandenburger (2007)</span>, analyze Forward Induction in extensive
form games based on its known tight connection with Iterated Removal
of Weakly Dominated Strategies in strategic form games. The following
example involving explicit reasoning is from <span class="citation">Perea
(2012)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> A Forward Induction
scenario.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig22">
<img src="fig22.svg" alt="This is a game tree diagram illustrating the example. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 22.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig22" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
In the matrix game, no move dominates any other. Hence <i>E</i> should
consider all outcomes possible. In this case, going <em>left</em> is
safer for her than going <em>right</em>, and hence <i>A</i> should
play <em>Left</em> at the start. However, if <i>E</i> rationalizes,
and observes <i>A</i> going <em>Right</em>, she has extra information
available at her choice node. Following the rationality assumption,
<i>A</i> expects to do better than 3, which is only possible if he
intends to play <em>Up</em> in the matrix game. Now this tells
<i>E</i> to proceed to the matrix and play the <em>left</em> column
therein. <i>E</i>&rsquo;s results in a better payoff than the 2 of her
original safe option.</p>

<p>
From a logical perspective, a study of Forward Induction requires
epistemic-doxastic models with ternary world-dependent plausibility
relations, combined with the public announcement updates or
plausibility upgrade described above <span class="citation">(<a href="#BIBR">Section 4.1.2</a>;
 see. also van Benthem 2014)</span>. No definitive logical analysis of
Forward Induction has been published so far.</p>

<h4 id="PostGameRati">4.2.3 Post-game rationalization</h4>

<p>
Comparatively little attention has been paid in the literature to what
players do after a game. Yet, these follow up-activities are often
crucial, for instance to establish general lessons learned that may be
valuable for future game play. Such interpretations are especially
prominent in small or isolated groups, where the same opponent might
be encountered again in the future.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Preference change after a game</strong></span> At a
simple level, post-game activity can consist in setting, or altering,
the second input parameter of rational choice beside belief: the
players&rsquo; preferences. Several folklore results relate to this
option. For instance, when playing against a given strategy of another
player with known preferences, any strategy can be rationalized by
choosing suitable preferences among outcomes. <span class="citation">Liu
(2011)</span> discusses several preference based
rationalization algorithms using dynamic logics of preference
change.</p>

<p>
Preference change can also occur during a game. Players may receive
new information about the game&rsquo;s end states and their
properties. They may also follow a command or a suggestion from an
authority, establishing a preference or reversing an earlier one.
Relatedly, players may change their external goals pursued in the
game, or they may adjust their preferences for more internal reasons,
as in the phenomenon of &lsquo;sour grapes&rsquo; <span class="citation">(Elster
1983)</span>.</p>

<div id="LongTermPlay">

<h4 id="PlayLongTermTempPers">4.2.4 Play in a long-term temporal perspective</h4>

<p>
The main focus of this section is the local dynamics of what happens
before, during and after a single game. There is also a broader
perspective of time, in which all these activities are embedded in an
extended temporal universe, large enough to include all possible
trajectories of the game, finite or just as well infinite. In
 <a href="../game-evolutionary/index.html">evolutionary game theory</a>,
 in particular, infinite games typically arise from iterated play of
finite games, with <span class="citation">Lewis</span>&rsquo;
signaling games (<span class="citation">2002</span>) as prominent
example in philosophy.</p>

<p>
Assuming an extended infinite temporal perspective raises additional
questions about players&rsquo; strategic foresight and adaptation
<span class="citation">(Christoff 2016)</span>. Various long-term
perspectives differ drastically in this respect, ranging from the
minimal rationality assumptions typical of evolutionary game theory to
high reasoning complexities of agents anticipating the long term
effects of their choices.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Temporal logics</strong></span> While infinite game
forms were briefly alluded to in
 <a href="#gs:spectop">Section 2.10</a>,
 infinite play focuses on agency over time. A host of temporal logics
for this end have been put forward, including interpreted systems
<span class="citation">(Fagin, Halpern et al. 1995)</span>,
epistemic-temporal logic <span class="citation">(Parikh &amp;
Ramanujam 2003)</span>, STIT <span class="citation">(Belnap &amp;
Perloff 1988; Horty &amp; Belnap 1995)</span>, ATL <span class="citation">(Alur,
Henzinger, &amp; Kupferman 2002; van der Hoek
&amp; Wooldridge 2003)</span>, and others. Many of these systems
combine multiple modalities. Consequentially, their complexity can be
very high (undecidable, non-axiomatizable, or even non-arithmetical),
as <span class="citation">Halpern &amp; Vardi (1986)</span> show in a
pioneering study for the case of combining time and knowledge.
Surveying this area is beyond the scope of this entry, cf. the entry
on
 <a href="../logic-temporal/index.html">temporal logics</a>.
 A unifying view of connections between the various paradigms is
presented in <span class="citation">van Benthem and Pacuit
(2006)</span>.</p>

 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig23" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
Just as with finite games, players&rsquo; preferences must be
specified for studying equilibria in potentially infinite games. In
lack of outcome nodes or final moments to attach preferences to, these
are naturally thought of in terms of players&rsquo; goals, expressed
as properties the game&rsquo;s histories should satisfy. Such goals
can be local propositional facts true at some particular moment. But
goals can also concern global properties of histories such as avoiding
or reaching the same position some specified number of times, or more
abstractly, achieving safety or fairness in some appropriate sense.
All such properties can be specified in temporal logics. For the case
of Linear Temporal Logic (<em>LTL</em>), the &lsquo;Boolean
games&rsquo; of <span class="citation">Gutierrez, Harrenstein, and
Wooldridge (2015)</span> have developed the temporal goal based
approach in depth. Notably, this framework validates a logical version
of the &lsquo;folk theorem&rsquo; for iterated games, cf. <span class="citation">Osborne
&amp; Rubinstein (1994)</span>: Under natural
conditions on goals, iterated games can have novel equilibria not
supervenient on the base game&rsquo;s Nash equilibria. Further
significant uses of temporal logics connect game theory with belief
revision theory <span class="citation">(Battigalli &amp; Bonanno 1999;
Perea 2012; Stalnaker 1998)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Evolutionary game theory and dynamical
systems</strong></span> A prominent application of iterated games
occurs in evolutionary game theory <span class="citation">(Maynard
Smith 1982; Hofbauer &amp; Sigmund 1998; Gintis 2000)</span>, a
framework that has many applications in biology, formal sociology, but
also linguistics and philosophy <span class="citation">(Lewis 2002;
Skyrms 2010; Alexander 2007; Clark 2012)</span>.</p>

<p>
Little work has been done so far on the logical analysis of
evolutionary games along the dimensions of this entry. In fact, there
are striking conceptual differences between evolutionary games and the
style of analysis pursued here that might be dubbed &lsquo;high
rationality&rsquo;-oriented. Rather than incorporating intentional,
strategic actors, evolutionary games work by temporal progression of a
dynamical system which is driven by individuals&rsquo; fitness values
derived from game-like encounters with others. Within such systems,
behavior is not driven by belief updates or complex strategic
considerations. Rather, players typically display &lsquo;low
rationality, following certain hard-wired strategies. Much of the
evolutionary system&rsquo;s dynamics is then driven by changes in the
population&rsquo;s composition of strategy types.</p>

<p>
Even so, evolutionary game theory does invite connections to logic.
The evolutionary success of simple strategies like Tit-for-Tat <span class="citation">(Axelrod
&amp; Hamilton 1981)</span> raises the
question of just when complex logically based high-rationality
strategies can be replaced by equally efficient alternatives simple
enough to be played by automata or similar models of bounded agents,
<span class="citation">(Gr&auml;del, Thomas, &amp; Wilke 2002)</span>.
At a higher level of abstraction, there also is an incipient line of
research into the connection between logic and dynamical systems, a
standard tool for analyzing evolutionary games. This strand includes a
bimodal topological logic of time <span class="citation">(Kremer &amp;
Mints 2007)</span>, fixed-point logics of oscillation <span class="citation">(van
Benthem 2015)</span>, and a systematic linkage
between dynamic-epistemic update logics and dynamical systems over
metric spaces <span class="citation">(Klein &amp; Rendsvig
2017)</span>. At a much concreter level, one important species of
evolutionary games are signaling games <span class="citation">(Lewis
2002; Cho &amp; Kreps 1987; Osborne &amp; Rubinstein 1994; Skyrms
2010: van Rooy 2004)</span>, where agents send and receive signals
about the state of the world. Signaling games match up naturally with
the earlier dynamics logic of information flow during play.</p>

<h3 id="ConcTheoPlay">4.3 Conclusion: Theory of Play</h3>

<p>
Topics discussed in this section are less standard in the literature
than those of the sections before. In an orthodox reading, various of
the aspects addressed would not be considered part of game theory
proper. The extended agenda followed here has been embraced by <span class="citation">van
Benthem, Pacuit, and Roy (2011)</span> as a
larger program for logic, going under the heading &lsquo;Theory of
Play&rsquo;. The underlying line of reasoning is that games do not
fully determine their outcomes, as they allow for various styles of
play. Hence, it might be the process of play itself, including
players&rsquo; types and how they change over time, that might the
best focus for understanding interaction, rather than mere games or
game forms alone. Similar lines of argument can be found in the
foundations of computation where it has been proposed that the
essential topic of study should be <em>behavior</em> <span class="citation">(Abramsky
2008)</span>.</p>

<div id="Play:FurtherDirections">

<h3 id="FurtDire">4.4 Further Directions</h3>

<p>
<span><strong>Belief revision and learning theory</strong></span>
Belief revision in repeated games bears natural resemblance to limit
learning of
 <a href="../learning-formal/index.html">formal learning theory</a>
 <span class="citation">(Kelly 1996)</span>. <span class="citation">Baltag,
Gierasimczuk, and Smets (2011)</span> analyze
learning in terms of initial epistemic-doxastic models over which
finite histories of signals trigger the learner to revise beliefs,
represented as changes in epistemic accessibility or plausibility
order. It turns out that both iterated public announcement and
iterated radical upgrade as discussed above are universal learning
methods, though only the latter maintains this property in the
presence of (finitely many) errors in the input stream.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Goal dynamics and intentions</strong></span> While
preferences and goals have so far been assumed fixed and universally
known, this is by no means necessary. <span class="citation">van
Otterloo (2005)</span> presents a dynamic logic of strategic powers,
where information about players&rsquo; intentions and preferences can
be announced during play. <span class="citation">Roy (2008)</span>
uses announcements of intentions to obtain simplified solution
procedures for strategic games. More concrete scenarios of extraneous
information flow are found in <span class="citation">Parikh,
Ta&#351;dem&#305;&#775;r, and Witzel (2013)</span>, where agents
manipulate the knowledge of others during play.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Game change</strong></span> In many real life scenarios,
players do not know the full game tree they are playing. Even if they
did, it might change during play. Or, at least, players may attempt to
change the game. A concrete example is provided by the game tree in
 <a href="#BIPA">Section 4.1.1</a>.
 There, the inefficient Backward induction outcome \((1, 0)\) could be
avoided by <i>E</i> promising not to go left. When made binding (for
instance through imposing a fine) this announcement eliminates
histories and, consequentially, a new backward Induction outcome of
\((2,2)\) results. Hence, both players can be made better off by
restricting the freedom of one. Game theory has sophisticated analyses
of such scenarios, including an analysis of &lsquo;cheap talk&rsquo;
<span class="citation">(Osborne &amp; Rubinstein 1994)</span>, asking
when such announcements are credible. On the logical side, this
suggests an analysis of signaling games <span class="citation">(van
Rooy 2004)</span>. We are not aware of any logical work done in this
direction.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Real games</strong></span> The discrepancy between
specification of a game and the realities of play is especially
striking in real game play, either of the &lsquo;natural kind&rsquo;
in common parlor games <span class="citation">(van Ditmarsch &amp;
Kooi 2015)</span>, or of the artificial kind found in the laboratory
experiments of experimental game theory <span class="citation">(Camerer
2003)</span>. Little work has been done by
logicians in this realm, though there is a broad tradition of
computational analysis of games <span class="citation">(Schaeffer
&amp; van der Herik 2002; Kurzen 2011)</span>. Any adequate
logical analysis would clearly need to incorporate the considerations
on bounded agency discussed in
 <a href="#natplayers">Section 3</a>.</p>
 
<p>
<span><strong>Mathematical foundations</strong></span> Logic of play
as discussed here raises issues of how to interfaces local with global
dynamics. This shows in particular with logical limit behavior, where
observations and assertions are made repeatedly. Limit models of
public announcement, as described earlier, can be
&lsquo;self-fulfilling&rsquo; or &rsquo;self-refuting&rsquo;. In the
first case, the property asserted becomes common knowledge among all
agents, whereas in the second it eventually becomes false at the
actual world. With soft update on plausibility models, a third option
arises, namely, infinite oscillation, or even divergence <span class="citation">(Baltag
&amp; Smets 2009)</span>. To date, there is
no general logical theory of these phenomena, but see <span class="citation">van Benthem (2011)</span> on the use of
fixed-point logics for limit models, <span class="citation">Miller and
Moss (2005)</span> on the high complexity of public announcement logic
with finitely iterated announcements, and <span class="citation">Klein
and Rendsvig (2017)</span> on limit behavior of product updates.</p>

<h2 id="InteLogiProbGame">5. Interfacing Logic and Probability in Games</h2>

<p>
Probabilities are central to game theory, where they serve two
prominent roles. First, they structure players&rsquo; uncertainty
about various aspects of the game, including the state of nature, the
type of opponent faced, and past, present, and future moves of other
players. Second, ever since the origins of Game Theory <span class="citation">(von
Neumann &amp; Morgenstern 1944)</span>,
probabilistic randomization has served to expand the agents&rsquo;
space of possible actions. While the interpretation of such mixed
strategies has been the subject of extensive debate <span class="citation">(Sugden
1991)</span>, it is uncontroversial that
randomized moves add significant depth to the analysis of games. In
fact, the concept of mixed strategies is vital for a number of seminal
results in classic game theory including the existence of Nash
equilibria in finite games of imperfect information.</p>

<p>
Probability and its logic is a major topic in both mathematics and
philosophy, as discussed in the entries on
 <a href="../probability-interpret/index.html">interpretations of probability</a>,
 and
 <a href="../logic-probability/index.html">logic and probability</a>.
 The current section merely outlines a few key connections between
probability and the logical analysis of games. The following
presentation assumes all state spaces to be finite, ignoring
important technical and conceptual issues around the transition from
finite to infinite state spaces.</p>

<h3 id="ProbBeli">5.1 Probabilities and Beliefs</h3>

<p>
Probabilistic methods are widely employed to represent beliefs of
agents within and outside of games, witness
 <a href="../epistemology-bayesian/index.html">Bayesian epistemology</a>.
 Typically, a probabilistic belief model consists of two components: a
space of possible states that the agent&rsquo;s beliefs range over,
plus a quantitative probability function denoting how probable the
agent judges different propositions or states to be. In qualitative
logical models, on the other hand, agentive belief is represented in
varying degree of detail. The coarsest approach only distinguishes
states the agent considers possible from those she rules out. This is the
perspective of standard epistemic-doxastic logics, such as multi-agent
S5 and KD45 discussed in
 <a href="#subsect:epistemic">Section 3.6</a>.
 More fine-grained perspectives are employed in the plausibility
models of <span class="citation">Boutilier (1994)</span> and <span class="citation">Baltag
and Smets (2008)</span>, where the range of
epistemic options is structured further by plausibility orderings
encoding which options agents take to be less or more likely. See also
Sections
 <a href="#subsect:belief">3.6.4</a>
 and
 <a href="#sec:beliefplay">4.2</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Both probabilistic and plausibilistic perspectives can express that
some alternative is more likely than another. However, there are also
conceptual differences between the two frameworks. Probabilistic
models can aggregate, allowing their logic to express, for instance,
whether many low-probability events combined can outweigh even the
highest-probability worlds. Aggregated probabilities play a key
role, for instance, in calculations of expected utility. Yet no such
thing can be expressed in plausibility semantics. For another striking
difference, plausibility models lead to a notion of belief that is
closed under conjunction. This conjunction closure typically fails for
probabilistic accounts of belief. See however <span class="citation">Leitgeb
(2017)</span> for a sophisticated bridge
between both types of modeling. </p>

<h3 id="LogiProbBack">5.2 From Logic to Probability and Back</h3>

<p>
On a received view, logical and probabilistic frameworks emphasize
different aspects of belief. Logic emphasizes coherence properties
between the propositions believed, such as closure under logical
implications or conjunction. Probabilistic reasoning, on the other
hand, stresses graded information and attitudes towards uncertain
events such as lotteries. Even so, there is a variety of approaches
attempting to unify the two types of reasoning by constructing bridges
between the frameworks.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>From qualitative to quantitative
probability</strong></span> Early attempts in this direction go back
to <span class="citation">Finetti (1970 [1974])</span>, striving for a
purely qualitative axiomatization of probability theory. A step
further towards logical reasoning are various theories of qualitative
probability <span class="citation">(Kyburg 1994)</span>, often based
on the assumption that classical quantitative notions of probability
are too demanding for real-life agents. In this line of research
agents need only reason with partial, comparative probability
assessments, rather than having fully specified probabilities for all
events. Logical frameworks for qualitative probability include <span class="citation">Segerberg
(1971), Fagin, Halpern, and Megiddo
(1990),</span> and <span class="citation">Delgrande and Renne
(2015)</span>. While differing in detail, all logics in this line have
in common that they allow for expressions of the form
\(\varphi\preceq\psi\), indicating that \(\psi\) is judged at least as
probable at \(\varphi\). Recent frameworks add various additional
refinements to this language. Similarly, <span class="citation">Heifetz
and Mongin (2001)</span> expand the axiomatic
analysis of probabilistic beliefs to higher order reasoning, working
on probabilistic type space akin to those introduced in
 <a href="#section:typespaces">Section 3.7</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Yet, the concept of qualitative probability is sometimes considered
flawed: a complete set of probabilistic-logical principles
guaranteeing that every complete description in the logical language
corresponds to a unique probability measure turns out to require a
complex calculus, involving an opaque infinite rule <span class="citation">(Kraft,
Pratt, &amp; Seidenberg 1959; Scott
1964)</span>. A new angle has been proposed in <span class="citation">Harrison-Trainor,
Holliday, and Icard (2016)</span>
through axiomatizing a low-complexity qualitative probabilistic logic
that emerges from relaxing the above unique correspondence requirement
to merely requiring compatibility with all probability measures of a
certain family.</p>

<p>
However, none of the frameworks described here are specific for games.
In fact, it remains to be seen whether qualitative probabilistic
logics, old or recent, can be used for a qualitative analysis of
game-theoretic solution concepts.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>From quantitative to qualitative
probability</strong></span> While the preceding line of research aims
at recovering quantitative probability from qualitative notions, a
converse project shows how ubiquitous qualitative patterns might arise
naturally within a quantitative probabilistic setting. Building on
what is sometimes dubbed the Lockean Thesis, <em>threshold
approaches</em> connect probability to logic by stipulating that some
\(\varphi\) is to be believed simpliciter if the probability of
\(\varphi\) is above some appropriate numerical threshold <i>t</i>.
For most choices of threshold <i>t</i>, such translations do not
square well with standard logical desiderata, as beliefs will in
general not be closed under conjunction. However, in recent work <span class="citation">Leitgeb
(2017)</span> and <span class="citation">Lin
and Kelly (2012)</span> have identified conditions under which one can
do better. Building on ideas of <span class="citation">Skyrms
(1977)</span>, <span class="citation">Leitgeb</span> identifies
strong, context-dependent &lsquo;robustness conditions&rsquo; on
thresholds that guarantee the defined belief operator to satisfy the
KD45 axioms after all. <span class="citation">Lin and Kelly</span>, on
the other hand, work with non-uniform thresholds for transitioning
between logical and probabilistic notions of belief, allowing to
derive coherence between different forms of belief dynamics on the two
sides. For a recent study of the mathematical foundations and limits
of these approaches, as well as the conditional logics they generate
see <span class="citation">Mierzewski (2018)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="UpdaTracProb">5.3 Updating and Tracking Probabilities</h3>

<p>
In the dynamic perspective of game play, every move constitutes a new
piece of information agents have to take into account. Besides,
players may also change their beliefs about the game upon
deliberation, through communication or any other signals they receive,
be they reliable or not ( cf.
 <a href="#section:play">Section 4</a>).
 All such dynamic events raise the question of how new information is
to be incorporated into the agents&rsquo; beliefs and when
probabilistic updates have corresponding logical revisions or vice
versa.</p>

<p>
If the new information is of the hard type, accepted as irrevocably
true by all agents, the probabilistic counterpart of logical public
announcements is Bayesian conditioning. Both notions track each other
at a semantic level, meaning that their outputs amount to the same
thing. Computing beliefs after a public announcement means recomputing
in the submodel consisting of all states where the information
received was true. This is exactly the same mechanism as for
recalculating probabilities in Bayesian update. Moreover, for
reasoning about updates, both approaches require conditional notions:
conditional belief and conditional probability respectively. The
quantitative notion of conditional belief relates to the logical
notion of conditional belief \(B(\varphi|\psi)\), with the slight
caveat that the latter also allows for epistemic or doxastic operators
inside either argument. More refined logical notions of conditional
belief arise in the earlier-mentioned plausibility semantics of
 <a href="#BIBR">Section 4.1.2</a>,
 <span class="citation">(Baltag &amp; Smets 2008)</span>.</p>

<p>
Given the co-existence of qualitative and quantitative perspectives,
it makes sense to ask whether one can <em>track</em> the other. In a
static sense, tracking asks whether different notions of belief can be
translated into each other by omitting or transforming some of the
semantic details involved. A dynamic interpretation expands on this by
asking whether updating, either in the hard or soft varieties of
 <a href="#section:play">Section 4</a>,
 is compatible with these translations in a commutative diagram:
Information update in a new perspective after translation should yield
same result as first performing a matching update in the old
perspective and then translating <span class="citation">(van Benthem
2016)</span>. In games, the topic of tracking may refer not just to
information update, but also to solution concepts or moves in game
play described at the various levels considered in
 <a href="#gamestructures">Section 2</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The existence of tracking maps depends on the exact type of update
considered. By now there is a wide variety of updating policies on
plausibility models <span class="citation">(van Benthem &amp; Smets
2015)</span>, not all of which have obvious probabilistic
counterparts. Likewise, for well-known varieties of probabilistic
update, such as Jeffrey update, where the probability of selected
propositions can be reset at will, plausibility counterparts are not
easy to find, though the attempt of <span class="citation">van Benthem,
Gerbrandy, and Kooi (2009)</span> modifies dynamic-epistemic logic to
allow for Jeffrey update and other generalized probabilistic
policies.</p>

<h3 id="SpecGame">5.4 Specializing to Games</h3>

<p>
Virtually all aspects of game theory provide contacts between logical
and probabilistic perspectives. Clearly, this is true for the
different representations of knowledge, beliefs and their dynamics
just discussed. Other contacts occur at the level of game forms, cf.
 <a href="#gamestructures">Section 2</a>,
 where probabilities enrich the space of strategies. The resulting mixed moves require players to expand their
preferences to mixed outcomes, cf.
 <a href="#natplayers">Section 3</a>.
 Finally, at the level of reasoning about game play, cf.
 <a href="#section:play">Section 4</a>,
 probabilistic beliefs play a role in solution techniques such as
dominance or expected utility based reasoning.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Available actions and mixed strategies</strong></span>
Probabilistic mixtures of pure strategies are prominent in game
theory, as they can secure outcomes and payoffs that no pure strategy
alone could guarantee.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Matching Pennies.</p>

<p>
Consider the well-known game of matching pennies in matrix form:</p>

<table class="cell-center centered avoid-break cellpad-small-dense inner-rules">
<tr>
<th style="border:none"></th>
<th style="border:none"></th>
<th colspan="2" style="border-left:none;border-bottom:1px solid black">Bob</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td style="border:none"></td>
  <td style="border:none"></td>
  <td style="border-top:none"><i>x</i></td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black"><i>y</i></td></tr>
<tr>
<th rowspan="2" style="border-top:none;border-right:1px solid black">Ann</th>
  <td style="border-left:none"><i>a</i></td>
  <td>1,&minus;1 </td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">&minus;1, 1</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black"><i>b</i></td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">&minus;1,1</td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">1,&minus;1</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
For Ann, a mixed strategy of playing <i>a</i> exactly half of the time
guarantees an expected outcome of 0, no matter what Bob does. No pure
strategy could have achieved this.</p>

<p>
From a logical point of view, mixed strategies can be conceptualized as new
primitive actions in the earlier logics of games ( cf.
 <a href="#gamestructures">Section 2</a>).
 Yet, this treatment immediately renders the set of available actions
infinite. A cautiously refined logical language, extending logical
approaches to qualitative probability, can allow for expressions such
as an agent playing action <i>a</i> with probability at least
<i>q</i>, <span class="citation">(Delgrande and Renne
2015)</span>.</p>

<p>
A more challenging general question is how to relate classic
probabilistic approaches with their fixed-point results and ensuing
equilibrium existence theorems, with the logical fixed-point
approaches mentioned at several places in this entry. The latter
operate with step-by-step ordinal iterations, as opposed to the
gradual, approximative procedures that underlie the Brouwer or
Kakutani fixed-point theorems relevant for classical game theory. A
related question is just how much logic is needed to reproduce
probabilistic existence theorems within a qualitative framework.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Adding players&rsquo; preferences</strong></span> Once
preferences are added, mixed strategies trigger additional
intricacies. A strategy profile where some players pursue mixed
strategies does not produce a unique outcome, but a weighted
combination of outcomes. Thus, permitting mixed strategies requires
lifting preference relations to probabilistic mixtures of outcomes or
strategy profiles. Incorporating such mixtures may implicitly depart
from the standard, purely qualitative perspective on outcomes <span class="citation">(Ramsey
1931; Savage 1954)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Extended preference
comparison.</p>

<p>
The following two games are equivalent in terms of qualitative (i.e.,
ordinal) preferences between outcomes for both players. However, they
differ in preferences between mixed outcomes, with </p> 

\[0.5(b,x)+0.5(b,y)\succeq_A (a,x)\]

<p>
holding in the game to the left, but not in that to the right.</p>

<div class="center">

<table class="inner-rules cellpad-small-dense" style="display:inline-block">
<tbody>
<tr class="header">
  <td></td>
  <td><i>x</i></td>
  <td><i>y</i></td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>a</i></td>
  <td>1,0</td>
  <td>2,1</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>b</i></td>
  <td>0,1</td>
  <td>4,0</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>

<table class="inner-rules cellpad-small-dense" style="display:inline-block; padding-left: 2em">
<tbody>
<tr class="header">

  <td><i>x</i></td>
  <td><i>y</i></td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>a</i></td>
  <td>1,0</td>
  <td>2,1</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>b</i></td>
  <td>&minus;10,1</td>
  <td>4,0</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>
Going this way poses some logical challenges. For example, consider a
preference relation over probabilistic mixtures of outcomes, where
\(m^t(a,b)\) stands for obtaining <i>a</i> with a probability of
<i>t</i>, and <i>b</i> otherwise. This setting is in the scope of
<span class="citation">von Neumann and Morgenstern</span>&rsquo;s
<span class="citation">1944</span> well-known &lsquo;continuity
axiom&rsquo; that is characterized by an implicit infinite
disjunction: </p> 

\[ {a \preceq b\preceq c} \Rightarrow  {\exists t \in(0,1):\ m^t(a,c)\preceq b \preceq  m^{1-t}(a,c)} \]

<p>
This seems well beyond the expressive power of standard probabilistic
logics.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Solution concepts and game play</strong></span>
Probabilization also impact the process of game play and its reasoning
dynamics, for instance by changing the earlier-mentioned calculus of
weak and strong dominance
 (<a href="#IRSection">Section 3.4</a>).
 Consider the following game, cf. <span class="citation">de Bruin
(2005)</span>:</p>

<table class="cell-center centered avoid-break cellpad-small-dense inner-rules">
<tr>
<th style="border:none"></th>
<th style="border:none"></th>
<th colspan="2" style="border-left:none;border-bottom:1px solid black">B</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td style="border:none"></td>
  <td style="border:none"></td>
  <td style="border-top:none"><i>x</i></td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black"><i>y</i></td></tr>
<tr>
<th rowspan="3" style="border-top:none; border-right:1px solid black">A</th>
  <td style="border-left:none"><i>a</i></td>
  <td>0, 5 </td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">5, 0</td></tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>b</i></td>
  <td>5, 0 </td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">0, 5 </td></tr>
<tr>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black"><i>c</i></td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">1, 1 </td>
  <td style="border: 1px solid black">1, 1</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
None of <i>A</i>&rsquo;s strategies are dominated in terms of pure
strategies. However, in terms of expected outcomes, <i>c</i> is
dominated by an equal mixture of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. Thus, solution
procedures analyzed earlier such as iterated removal of weakly or
strongly dominated strategies may provide different and incompatible
outcomes, depending on whether mixed strategies are considered or not.
No satisfactory logical analysis of the earlier kind seems to exist
for this setting.</p>

<h3 id="FurtChalForLogiAppr">5.5 Further Challenges for a Logical Approach</h3>

<p>
Further challenges to the interplay of logic and probabilistic
reasoning abound. By way of conclusion, here is a dimension that seems
hard to capture in purely qualitative logical terms. A characteristic
feature of game- and decision-theoretic reasoning is that beliefs and
preferences are <em>entangled</em> in various ways <span class="citation">(Liu
2011)</span>. For instance, the crucial notion
of expected utility entangles probability, representing beliefs, with
utilities, standing for preferences. Players faced with probabilistic
uncertainty about the opponent&rsquo;s present and future actions are
often advised to maximize expected utility <span class="citation">(von
Neumann &amp; Morgenstern 1944; Savage 1954)</span>. Hence, even if
one has found qualitative counterparts for probabilistic belief and
cardinal utility separately, entanglement poses the additional
difficulty of merging these two qualitative analyses in a way that
matches what the quantitative side achieves easily by forming some
arithmetical combination of both components.</p>
</div>

<div id="section:gamification">

<h2 id="Gami">6. Gamification</h2>

<p>
The main topic of this entry is a logical approach to game theory,
bringing classical notions and methods from logic to bear upon games.
This project is sometimes called &lsquo;logic of games&rsquo;. There
also is a converse direction of &lsquo;logic as games&rsquo;, where
game theoretic concepts are employed to elucidate basic notions of
logic. This section presents a brief discussion on this direction as a
natural counterpoint to the main lines of the entry. For an extensive
survey see the entries on
 <a href="../logic-games/index.html">logic and games</a>
 and
 <a href="../games-abstraction/index.html">games, abstraction and completeness</a>.</p>
 
<div id="sec:logicgame">

<h3 id="LogiGame_1">6.1 Logic Games</h3>

<p>
Many notions in logic have been analyzed in game-theoretic terms</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Evaluation games</strong></span> There are well-known
two-player games for evaluating a first-order formula \(\varphi\)
within a given logical model. These games are played between Verifier
and Falsifier, who can both test atomic assertions, and specify the
value of variables from a given domain <span class="citation">(Hintikka
1973)</span>. The schedule of the game is
determined from the syntactic structure of the formula \(\varphi\).
Disjunctions and existential quantifiers require choices of the
Verifier, conjunctions and universal quantifiers of the Falsifier,
and negations trigger a role switch between the two players. The
result is the following match between winning strategies and the
ordinary semantic notion of truth:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Formula \(\varphi\) is true in model <i>M</i> under assignment
<i>s</i> iff the Verifier has a winning strategy in the associated
game \(game(M, s, \varphi)\). </p>
</div>

<p>
Correspondingly, Falsifier has a winning strategy if the formula
\(\varphi\) is false in the model. Evaluation games turn out to be an
extremely flexible tool. By suitably modulating rules and winning
conventions, adequate evaluation games can be found for most logical
systems. Doing so, however, can be a highly non-trivial task, as
witnessed by the intricate infinite &lsquo;parity games&rsquo;
corresponding to fixed-point logics such as the modal &mu;-calculus
<span class="citation">(Venema 2008)</span>. For the present purpose,
it should be noted that this style of analysis ties the very logical
operations, conjunctions, disjunctions, modal operators, to natural
moves in a game. Similarly, the notion of truth is linked to the
fundamental game-theoretic notion of a strategy in an extensive form
game (cf.
 <a href="#gamestructures">Section 2</a>):
 a complex, structured object which may here be understood as a reason
or an explanation for the truth or falsity of the formula.</p>

<p>
The links between both perspectives are so close, that valid
principles of logic come to express game-theoretic facts. For
instance, after a little analysis, the law of excluded middle implies
that always either Verifier or Falsifier has a winning strategy, cf. <a href="#modextgame">Section 2.4</a>. In
other words, logical evaluation games for classical logic are
determined in the game-theoretic sense. In fact, This property extends
to most games for non-classical logics.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Further logic games</strong></span> Logic games exist
for many other purposes. Ehrenfeucht-Fra&iuml;ss&eacute; games serve
model comparison <span class="citation">(Ehrenfeucht 1961; Ebbinghaus
&amp; Flum 1995)</span>, Lorenzen games perform proof analysis <span class="citation">(Kamlah
1973 [1984])</span> and tableau games execute
model construction <span class="citation">(Hodges 1985)</span>. In
each case, strategies in the game match important logical notions. In
Lorenzen dialogue games, for instance, winning strategies for the
Proponent of a claim correspond to proofs of that claim from premises
granted by the Opponent, whereas winning strategies for the Opponent
are constructions of counter-models. Thus, proofs and models, two
quite distinct notions in logic, co-exist within a single game.</p>

<p>
There exists an alternative, game-theoretic way of interpreting these
connective results. Suppose the game under study is fixed, and
associated with some sort of &lsquo;game board&rsquo; representing
major features of the game&rsquo;s general state (think of Chess,
though more abstract game boards may occur). Then the above
equivalences suggest that winning strategies, i.e., a typical
game-theoretic notion defined in terms of the complete extensive game
tree, is equivalent to a simpler &lsquo;invariant&rsquo; that can be
defined entirely in terms of some game board associated with the
tree&rsquo;s nodes. Identifying useful such invariants is a well-known
art in the analysis of concrete games. In terms of a main theme of
this entry, invariants can live at different levels of representation
associated with a given class of games.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Game semantics</strong></span> One can view logic games
as mere didactic devices analyzing logical notions that were already
well-understood. Or, in other terms, as offering a concrete way of
teaching logic that draws on game-theoretic intuitions. However, logic
games have more to offer. First of all, new logics are suggested by
pursuing natural variations in winning conventions, moves, or
scheduling within existing logic games. Moreover, viewing logical
operations as game constructors suggests a new, refined view on
logical constants. Conjunction, for instance, now splits naturally
into a sequential and a parallel version. Similar examples of
parallelism also exist in logics of computation. Moreover, associating
quantifiers with object picking, as in evaluation games, turns
quantifiers into special types of atomic games that connect to the
following formula by an abstract operation of game composition. The
general logic of this abstract composition operation combined with
propositional operations of choice and switch has been shown
decidable, providing a new decidable core logic inside first-order
logic whose existence had not been suspected <span class="citation">(van
Benthem 2014)</span>. Games, hence, can offer a
fresh perspective on existing logical systems.</p>

<p>
A major source of independent, game-theoretic perspectives on logic is
the game semantics of computational logics. In this setting, the
status of logic games may change. Rather than being a mere pedagogical
or exploratory device, to some, these games are considered the true
meaning of logical constants.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="ReceLogiRelaGame">6.2 Recent Logic-Related Games</h3>

<p>
The distinction between game logics and logic games is not always
sharp. Recent literature has seen a number of games whose design is
connected to logic, yet they are not meant to analyze logical notions
per se.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Sabotage Games.</p>

<p>
Sabotage games were proposed to analyze algorithmic tasks in adverse
circumstances. Consider the below network between some European
cities:</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="f:fig24">
<img src="fig24.svg" alt="This is a diagram of four cities in a ring around the fifth. The extended description (link in figure caption) will describe the tree." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 24.</span>
 <a href="figdesc.html#f:fig24" title="Extended Description" class="smaller">&#9432;</a></p>
</div>

<p>
It is easy to travel either way between Amsterdam and the German town
of Saarbruecken. Now, let a malevolent Demon start canceling
connections in the network. At every stage, let the Demon take out one
link, while the Traveler can afterwards follow one of the remaining
links. This turns a one-agent planning problem into a two-player
sabotage game. Zermelo-style reasoning shows that, from Saarbruecken,
a German Traveler still has a winning strategy, while in Amsterdam,
the Demon has the winning strategy against the Dutch Traveler, by
first cutting a link close to Saarbruecken. The symmetry of the
original search problem is broken.</p>

<p>
The sabotage game has been applied to a variety of scenarios,
including learning <span class="citation">(Gierasimczuk, Kurzen, &amp;
Vel&aacute;zquez-Quesada 2009)</span>, and communication networks
<span class="citation">(Aucher, van Benthem, &amp; Grossi
2018)</span>. On finite graphs, the game is clearly determined, with
the computational complexity of identifying who has a winning strategy
being Pspace-complete <span class="citation">(L&ouml;ding &amp; Rohde
2003)</span>.</p>

<p>
The existence of this winning strategy can be expressed by a
first-order formula. More specifically, winning conditions can be
defined in a bimodal logic that combines a standard modality for
travel steps with a new modality for one-step arrow deletion,
interpreted in models \(M = (W, R, V)\):</p>

<p class="center">
\(M, s \vDash [{-}]\varphi\quad\)
For each edge \((u, v)\) in \(R:\, \, (W, R {-} \{(u. v)\}, V) \vDash
\varphi\)</p>

<p>
This logic fits the sabotage game closely. On top, it is a natural
fragment of the first-order language of graphs. Surprisingly, this
logic is undecidable <span class="citation">(L&ouml;ding &amp; Rohde
2003)</span>, making it one of the simplest examples of an undecidable
modal logic over arbitrary models.</p>

<p>
Further graph games in a similar spirit exist, including the poison
game of <span class="citation">Duchet and Meyniel (1993)</span>, where
the Demon poisons nodes, rather than deleting edges. Extensive studies
of modal logics for changing graphs, and &mu;-calculi for defining
generic solutions to graph games are given in <span class="citation">Areces,
Figueira et al. (2011); Areces, Fervari, and
Hoffmann (2015); and Aucher, van Benthem, and Grossi (2018)</span>. A
classification of graph games including the effects of complex goal
formulas and imperfect information is found in <span class="citation">van

<p>
One perspective on such logics for reasoning about model change is the
semantic games approach of
 <a href="#sec:logicgame">Section 6.1</a>.
 In standard evaluation games, the initial model does not change.
Modalities for model change, however, require a process of formula
evaluation where the model of evaluation changes as, say, witnesses
for quantifiers are not replaced (unlike in standard semantics for
first-order logic), or moves change facts by causing damage to
accessibility relations. In other contexts, similar modalities are
justified by physical measurements that change the phenomenon under
investigation, <span class="citation">(Hintikka 2002; Renardel 2001;
&Aring;gotnes and W&aacute;ng 2017)</span>. Such generalized form of
semantics are of independent logical interest.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Knowledge Games.</p>

<p>
New logical games also arise naturally within the dynamics of
information, knowledge or belief as triggered by the process of game
play (cf.
 <a href="#section:play">Section 4</a>).
 In particular, information update suggests conversation games between
participants with similar or different goals. These games may be
cooperative, with players aiming to pool their information, thereby
turning distributed knowledge into common knowledge <span class="citation">(Meyer
&amp; van der Hoek 1995)</span>. But they can
also be competitive, say, when players strive to be the first to know
whether some relevant proposition holds. Mixtures between both modes
also occur, for instance with some players aiming to communicate a
fact that outsiders should not learn about <span class="citation">(van
Ditmarsch 2003)</span>.</p>

<p>
A concrete example are the &lsquo;announcement games&rsquo; of <span class="citation">&Aring;gotnes
and van Ditmarsch (2011)</span>.
Players speak simultaneously and only once, while pursuing goal that
are specified as epistemic formulas. Speaking is modeled by public
announcement, and players preferences are binary. They prefer final
models where their goal formula holds over those where it is
false.</p>

<p>
These games are conducted under imperfect information, as players may
not know the true state of their epistemic model. Accordingly, the
relevant strategies need to be uniform. Players must say the same
thing in all states they cannot distinguish. In general, then, many
solution concepts produce mixed strategy outcomes. In fact, it can be
shown that there exists simple announcement games without any unique
equilibrium in pure strategies. However, there is a relevant role for
logic to play. Suppose that the goal statements are all
&lsquo;universal&rsquo;, i.e., constructed from literals by applying
only conjunction, disjunction, knowledge operators, and dynamic
modalities with universal announcements. Truth of such formulas is
preserved when transitioning from a model to a submodel. Consequently,
epistemic uncertainty becomes less harmful and knowledge games with
universal goals have equilibria in pure strategies. Recently,
knowledge games have been expanded further to include both questions
and answers as separate actions of issue change and information change
<span class="citation">(&Aring;gotnes, van Benthem et al.
2012)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Example</strong></span> Boolean games.</p>

<p>
A third example of game design in between game logics and logic games
are the Boolean games of <span class="citation">Harrenstein et al.
(2001)</span> and <span class="citation">Gutierrez, Harrenstein, and
Wooldridge (2015)</span> that have been mentioned several times
already. Each player is handed control over a subset of the
propositional variables, and can pick truth values for these at will.
Using goals specified in temporal logics, these games can model a
large number of relevant scenarios of agency. By now, a growing
body of work addresses various aspects of Boolean games including
their computational characteristics (both single-shot and iterated),
their game-theoretic properties and equilibria <span class="citation">(Gutierrez,
Harrenstein, &amp; Wooldridge
2015)</span>, and their connections with games played on social
networks <span class="citation">(Seligman &amp; Thompson 2015)</span>.

<h3 id="SpecTopi_2">6.3 Special Topics</h3>

<p>
<span><strong>Back and forth between game logics and logic
games</strong></span> The topic of this section suggests cycles
between the two perspectives on logic and games. Given a logical
system, one can design logical games for it, which can then again be
studied using some appropriate game logic. Conversely, given a game,
one can introduce a logic for describing it, and then introduce
evaluation games for that logic, and so on. Sometimes these cycles
reach fixed-points, where, say, the evaluation game for a formula
describing some game is isomorphic to that game itself. But sometimes,
the cycling continues. For discussion, see <span class="citation">Rebuschi
(2006) and van Benthem (2014)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Imperfect information</strong></span> Logic games
naturally support imperfect information, where players do not have
complete access to what their opponents do. Epistemic variations can
have far-reaching consequences for the corresponding logics. A
particularly prominent framework among this lines is the
 <a href="../logic-if/index.html">independence friendly logic</a>
 of <span class="citation">Hintikka and Sandu (1989)</span>, see also
<span class="citation">Hintikka and Sandu (1997) and Mann, Sandu, and
Sevenster (2011)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Argumentation games and graph games</strong></span>
Another strand of game analysis with a connection to logic is the
study of argumentation networks <span class="citation">(Dung 1995;
Caminada &amp; Gabbay 2009)</span>, with uses in AI and philosophy
<span class="citation">(Grossi 2013; Shi 2018)</span></p>

<p>
<span><strong>Computational logic</strong></span> The material in this
section is closely connected to games in computational logic, which
serve to analyze expressive power of languages. For relevant results
and connections with automata theory, see <span class="citation">Gr&auml;del,
Thomas, and Wilke (2002)</span> and
<span class="citation">van Benthem (2014)</span>.</p>

<p>
<span><strong>Gaming and mechanism design</strong></span> Game design
is a well-known aspect in the area of gaming <span class="citation">(Rouse
2000)</span>. Likewise, mechanism design is an
established topic in game theory <span class="citation">(Nisan &amp;
Ronen 2001; Osborne &amp; Rubinstein 1994)</span>. For connections
between between logic, game design and planning, see <span class="citation">(L&ouml;we,

<h2 id="SummFurtDire">7. Summary and Further Directions</h2>

<p>
This entry presents an overview of current work at the interface of
logic and games. The topics surveyed fall in a number of strands
including current logical analysis of games in the broadest sense,
contacts between logic and classic game theory, connections with
probability and with computation, and, lastly, the game theoretic
content of logic itself. All this produced a perhaps bewildering
variety of logical systems. Yet, this entry emphasized the coherence
of different approaches to logical analysis, some &lsquo;zooming
in&rsquo; on particular aspects in detail, others &lsquo;zooming
out&rsquo;, thereby focusing on general patterns. What has hopefully
become clear in this way is that the various topics span a highly
interconnected field. For further details, see the various
game-related entries in this Encyclopedia and the literature
cited.</p>

<p>
In terms of further desiderata, the coarse grained perspective of
logical modeling may help discover new abstract, general patterns in
social behavior beyond the details of games and game theory. A
concrete example might be a description of general skills and insights
that players acquire by playing a given type of games. A more
foundational example would be a formalization of the insight that all
concrete social interaction rest on underlying general notions of
&lsquo;dependence&rsquo; with their own high-level logic, cf. the
semantic dependence logics of <span class="citation">V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen
(2007) and Baltag (2016)</span>. For an
alternative proof-theoretic approach in this style, relying on the
general postulates for competitive games of <span class="citation">Johansen
(1982)</span>, see <span class="citation">Hu
and Kaneko (2014)</span>.</p>

<p>
The interface area of logic and games still is <em>in statu
nascendi</em>. Correspondingly, there are obvious gaps and desiderata
on the logic side, which are reflected in the material in this
entry.</p>

<p>
In particular, one fundamental theme are syntactic perspectives on
game-theoretic reasoning. Samples of a proof-theoretic style of
analysis for play can be found in <span class="citation">de Bruin
(2005)</span>. More concretely, <span class="citation">Zvesper
(2010)</span> analyzes classical results in epistemic game theory,
<span class="citation">(cf. Tan &amp; Werlang 1988; Aumann
1999)</span>, in terms of abstract modalities for belief and
optimality, showing how a few simple proof rules from modal
&mu;-calculus can capture the essence of famous results in epistemic
game theory. Proof-theoretic aspects of logic have so far been 
overshadowed by semantic analyses, although this situation is changing
slowly <span class="citation">(Artemov 2014; Kaneko 2002; Kaneko &amp;
Suzuki 2003)</span>. Model-based reasoning provides abstract semantic
perspectives on games that can aid conceptual clarification, and the
discovery of general laws. But it might turn out to be proof theory
that governs the concrete reasoning used in the semantics, and that
may be able to guide the context of justification in establishing
general facts about games.</p>

<p>
A further contact with logic that has been ignored in this entry is
the rich interface between games and descriptive set theory <span class="citation">(Woodin
2010; Kanamori 2003)</span>.</p>

<p>
It should be stressed once more that logic is not the only formal
discipline that throws light on games. Quantitative probability enters
the study of games in many ways, both in classical and in evolutionary
game theory. The interface of logic and games may well profit from the
many old and new contacts between logic and probability <span class="citation">(Leitgeb
2017; Lin &amp; Kelly 2012;
Harrison-Trainor, Holliday, &amp; Icard 2016)</span>.</p>

<p>
Another link that remained underrepresented in this entry are
computational aspects. The study of games, play and players has
natural connections with computation and agency in computer science
and AI <span class="citation">(Gr&auml;del, Thomas, &amp; Wilke 2002;
Abramsky 2008; Halpern 2013; Perea 2012; Brandenburger 2014)</span>.
The proper perspective on what has been presented here may well turn
out to be a triangle of interfaces between logic, games, and
computation.</p>

<p>
As for still broader connections, we have not done justice to all
links between logic, games and philosophy, of which more are found in
<span class="citation">Stalnaker (1996, 1999)</span>. The same is true
for links to linguistics and psychology <span class="citation">(Clark
2012)</span>. In this language-oriented connection, one should also
mention the work of <span class="citation">Bjorndahl, Halpern, and
Pass (2017)</span> on the natural language used in specifying games
and reasoning about them, thus making game analysis more
description-dependent.</p>

<p>
Finally, the main thrust of this entry is theoretical and
foundational. However, there also is a more practical aspect to logic
and games. Logic plays a role in cognitive psychology and experimental
game theory, if only to identify testable hypotheses related to Theory
of Mind or strategic reasoning <span class="citation">(Ghosh,
Meijering, &amp; Verbrugge 2014; Ghosh &amp; Verbrugge 2018; Bicchieri
1993; Fagin, Halpern et al. 1995)</span>. Lastly, some work at the
interface of logic and games suggests outreach to the world of actual
parlor games <span class="citation">(van Ditmarsch &amp; Kooi 2015;
van Benthem &amp; Liu 2019)</span>.</p>

<p>
All in all, the claim of this entry is a modest one. Logic and games
form a natural combination, that may reveal interesting things when
pursued explicitly. Even so, too much logic may import too much of a
formal apparatus, which may end up strangling the games perspective:
logical systems are infinite machineries that can easily overwhelm a
concrete game of interest. In short, the contact has to be managed
with care.</p>

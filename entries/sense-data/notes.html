<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Sense Data</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Broad (1923: 240) used instead the term &ldquo;sensa&rdquo; (singular
&ldquo;sensum&rdquo;).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Firth (1949&ndash;50 [1976: 220]) suggests that, prior to Price,
sense-data theorists agreed with Locke and Berkeley in positing flat
or planar sense data (Firth has vision in mind). See Section 2.1.1 for
an exception in Descartes.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 It is a vexed question to what extent the notion of sensory
impression or bare sensation is present in various ancient and
medieval authors. Hamlyn (1961: 28) finds that Aristotle &ldquo;was on
the verge&rdquo; of distinguishing sensation from perception. Bynum
(1987: secs. 4, 8, 9) accepts a standard view on which Aristotle
distinguishes between what is passively received by the senses (the
proper objects such as color or sound) and subsequent acts of judgment
and interpretation by the common sense and phantasia, which make for
perceptions of objects. Gregoric (2007: pt. 3, ch. 5) qualifies this
standard view but accepts a role for the &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; in
perceiving objects. Lesses (1998) conveys the Stoic distinction
between impression and assent. L&oslash;kke (2008) examines the Stoic
distinction between passively received sense impressions and further
perceptual cognitive acts that yield perception of objects and
conceptual knowledge. Robinson (1994: ch. 1.2) finds a dominant theme
in ancient and medieval theories of perception to be the distinction
between a passively received sense impression and an active, perhaps
interpretive, response. Pasnau (1997) and Adriaenssen (2017) argue
that a &ldquo;veil of species&rdquo; problem arose in medieval
philosophy, with authors such as Thomas Aquinas being accused by
subsequent theorists of abetting skepticism about our knowledge of the
external world by making &ldquo;sensible species&rdquo; the immediate
objects of perception (even though the latter position was rejected by
Aquinas). Pasnau (1997: ch. 3.1) suggests that William Crathorn
posited intervening species that manifest natural instances of red in
the case of our seeing a red thing, so that the intervening medium and
the eye actually turn red (consonant with
 <a href="index-2.html#cn3">item 3 of the Classical Notion</a>).
 By contrast, most adherents of species theories held that the quality
of red in things causes intervening species that have a diminished
existence in the medium, eyes, and sensory nerves, which receive the
species without turning red, allowing the species to cause a visual
perception of red as a quality of the distal object. Typical species
theories thus do not affirm item 3. More generally, the presence of a
distinction between the reception of sense impressions and further
perceptual acts depending on interpretation or judgment is not
equivalent to the positing of classical sense data.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Lewis (1929), for example, while rejecting traditional sense data
(1929: 61), attributes to sensory experience two elements, sensuous
and conceptual:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There are, in our cognitive experience, two elements: the immediate
data, such as those of sense, which are presented or given to the
mind, and a form, construction, or interpretation, which represents
the activity of thought. Recognition of this fact is one of the oldest
and most universal of philosophic insights. (1929: 38)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Keeling (1968: 177; also, 160) ascribes to Descartes
&ldquo;sensa&rdquo; that are not ideas but objects of ideas. Firth
(1949&ndash;50 [1976: 215&ndash;216]) finds that Locke and Berkeley
posited sense data. Mundle (1971: 27, 38&ndash;44, 64&ndash;67, 72)
ascribes the concept of sense data to Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and
Hume. Yolton (1996: 26&ndash;27) notes that these authors have been
read as predicating sensory qualities &ldquo;of the mind&rdquo;, which
matches his conception of what &ldquo;sense-datum philosophers&rdquo;
maintain. Yolton himself resists this reading (although he finds the
position present in Hume&rsquo;s philosophical persona, but not his
common-sense persona: 1996: 134). Williams (1986) reads Descartes as
forcing perceivers to infer the external world from a sensory given
that shares many of the features of classical sense data. Robinson
(1994: ch. 1.4) describes Locke, Berkeley, and Hume as sense-data
theorists; so does Bennett (1971), but in ways that differ from the
Classical Notion.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 The question is debated of whether early moderns such as Descartes
and Locke held that sensory ideas are the direct object of perception
to the exclusion of direct perception of external objects (a version
of
 <a href="index-2.html#cn1">item 1</a>).
 Adriaenssen (2017: ch. 4.1) describes interpretations in which
Descartes makes ideas the exclusive object of sense perception and
those in which he does not, siding with the latter. He interprets
passages about immediate awareness as describing an immediate
awareness of the very ideas that also are direct perceptions of
external objects. Rogers (2004) offers a reading of Locke as a direct
realist. Newman (2009) argues that both Descartes and Locke adhere to
indirect accounts of the perception of external objects.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 On the contemporary notion of intentionality, which is related to
Descartes&rsquo; notion, see Jacob (2003 [2019]: sec. 10). The notion
of intentional content can include nonconceptual content. Thus, in
Descartes, the intentional being of a sensory idea might present
objects as being a certain way, without including the judgment that
they are as they appear. This echoes Descartes&rsquo; conceptual
distinction between sensation and perception.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 An adherent of the view that Berkeley attributes red as a property to
ideas might argue that this passage only indicates that <em>the
mind</em> is not extended and colored, not that <em>ideas</em> are not
extended and colored. The point is made difficult because Berkeley
never fully articulates his notion of an idea, so that when he says
that &ldquo;qualities are in the mind ... by way of idea&rdquo;, we
cannot appeal to his theory of ideas to aid our interpretation. In the
present entry, Berkeley is taken to treat ideas and sensations as
presenting appearances by way of intentional content, so that item 3
is not ascribed to Berkeley. In virtue of having various contents,
sensory ideas present a world as having shaped areas of extension
bearing color, but we need not think of these ideas as being literally
extended and colored. This interpretation of Berkeley is similar to
Yolton&rsquo;s (1984: 134&ndash;136, 209&ndash;210).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Berkeley, in his discussions of the variability of sensory ideas,
having noted that perceptions of heat and cold, or figure and
extension, vary with the state and spatial position of the observer
and, accordingly, having concluded that such perceptions exist only in
the mind, observed that, in fact, &ldquo;this method of arguing doth
not so much prove that there is no extension or colour in an outward
object as that we do not know which is the true extension or
color&rdquo; (<em>Principles</em>, pt 1, art. 15; see also <em>Three
Dialogues</em>, First Dialogue [2008: 188]). Hume replied to this
challenge to arguments from variability at <em>Treatise</em>, I.4.4.4,
arguing that if some impressions presented external things directly
and others through a mental variant, there should be some phenomenal
difference between the different types of perception; there being
none, if some instances of sensory qualities are in the mind, all of
those that are phenomenally similar should be as well. A related
argument is found in Price (Sec. 2.2.3, below).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Interestingly, while affirming a material entity (the retinal image)
as the perceptual datum, his position also preserved the idea that
perception of the distant material object requires a further
psychological act. In this sense, he does not violate the spirit of
 <a href="index-2.html#cn5">item 5 of the Classical Notion</a>.
 But the retinal image, as a physical pattern of light, is not
private, hence Hamilton does not endorse
 <a href="index-2.html#cn7">item 7</a>.</p>

<div id="note-11">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 In fact, the term had appeared in British and American philosophy,
e.g., Sidgwick 1883 and James 1887; see Hatfield 2013a:
951&ndash;952.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Moore introduced the concept of sense data without the term in
&ldquo;The Nature and Reality of Objects of Perception&rdquo;
(1905&ndash;06). The paper offers a minimum characterization of what
is &ldquo;actually observed&rdquo; or &ldquo;directly perceived&rdquo;
in experience, which includes color patches and their spatial
relations (1905&ndash;06: 101).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 It differs from standard representative realism in not regarding the
representing datum as mental.</p>

 In offering a fuller account of physical theory in the <em>Analysis
of Matter</em>, Russell did not alter his basic position (1927: 10,
382), but he provided a finer-grained analysis of the unsensed
momentary particulars that occupy places without perceivers. These
momentary particulars, whose intrinsic properties are reached through
analogy with perceived momentary particulars, are projected to exhibit
structures as described in physical theory&mdash;the hypothetical
entities of physics, such as electrons, being constructions from these
particulars together with the sensed ones (1927: 227, 271, ch. 38).
For additional discussion and references, see Banks 2014 (ch. 4).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 Price (1932: 218&ndash;220) holds that many visual sense data are
three dimensional and he effectively endorses size and shape constancy
for objects near at hand, out to a &ldquo;few feet&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 In his statement of the argument, Price (1932: 32) uses a cricket
ball as his example; I&rsquo;ve altered it to a soccer ball to
accommodate a broader audience.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 Price (1932: 30&ndash;32) also offers a simpler version of the
argument (without continuity), which moves from
 <a href="index-2.html#arg4">premise 4</a>
 to the assertion that non-illusory experiences, as perceptual
experiences, do not differ phenomenally from illusory experiences, and
then uses
 <a href="index-2.html#arg9">9 and 10</a>
 to reach
 <a href="index-2.html#arg11">11</a>.
 This simpler formulation is closer to Hume&rsquo;s version of
Variation (see note 9).</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 A good sense of the place of sense data in epistemology with
attention to implications from psychology can be found in Firth
(1949&ndash;50); Robinson (1994) also offers an historical
overview.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Robinson (1994: 32) has labelled this the &ldquo;Phenomenal
Principle&rdquo;, which he states as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If there sensibly appears to a subject to be something which possesses
a particular sensible quality then there is something of which the
subject is aware which does possess that sensible quality,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and ultimately endorses (1994: ch. 7).</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 Firth (1949&ndash;50 [1976: 219&ndash;222]) groups James and the
Gestalt psychologists with the American philosopher John Dewey as
upholders of a &ldquo;percept theory&rdquo;, according to which
perceptual consciousness is unified in its awareness of an external
object, rejecting on phenomenal grounds the splitting of sensory
consciousness into sense data and material objects.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 Note that in his investigation of the composite nature of white
light, Newton was guided by the perceived qualities of light (red,
yellow, etc.). Having separated white light into homogeneal lights of
various colors, he posited light rays differing in color and
refractive properties (Newton 1718: bk I, pt I, def. 8; prop. 2). As
he explained, the rays themselves were not colored but were called
&ldquo;red-making&rdquo; (etc.) because of the color experiences they
caused in observers (1718: bk I, pt II, prop. 2, Definition).
Observations based on those experiences supported his findings about
the relations between colors and refractions; he had no access to
spectrophotometers or the like.</p>

 Jackson 1977 (ch. 4) seeks to undermine appearance theories. If that
argument were successful, it would block the particular criticism of
Jackson&rsquo;s sense-data theory noted here.</p>

 Empirical support for Price&rsquo;s claim for shape can be found in
Howard et al. (2014), and, more generally, for size constancy, in
Granrud (2012) and Hatfield (2016). Nonetheless, the interpretation of
phenomenal and cognitive factors in reports of shape and size
constancy remains contested (see Wagner 2012).</p>

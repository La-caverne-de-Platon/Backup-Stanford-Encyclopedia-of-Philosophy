<!--DO NOT MODIFY THIS LINE AND ABOVE--> 
<h2>Dr. Mises&rsquo; Merry Pranks</h2>

<p>
Fechner&rsquo;s authorship began in jest. His first writings were
satires, caricatures, fantasies and parodies, which appeared under the
pseudonym &lsquo;Dr. Mises&rsquo;. These writings poked fun at
<em>Naturphilosophie</em> and the medicine of his day. Most were
written in the early 1820s, but one appeared as late as 1846. Fechner
used the name &lsquo;Dr. Mises&rsquo; for his non-academic writings,
to separate his fictional persona from his professional one. The
reason he became Dr. Mises should be clear: this was an outlet for his
creative and imaginative side, which he felt had been repressed by
academic discipline and constraint. It would be a mistake to assume,
however, that Dr. Mises is a lightweight, that he is no philosopher.
Behind his humor there often lies serious points; some of his essays
put forward striking theses and undertake bold thought experiments.
They indeed anticipate the themes of the later philosophical works.
</p>

<p>
Fechner&rsquo;s first publication, <em>Beweis, da&szlig; der Mond aus
Iodine bestehe</em>, which appeared in 1821, is a spoof of medical
fashion. Shortly after its discovery in 1811 by Bernard Courtois,
iodine had become the new miracle drug in medicine. It had proved
remarkably effective as a cure for goiter; doctors soon began to
prescribe it as a cure for other illnesses. So convinced were they of
its curative powers that they saw its efficacy everywhere. Whatever
cured an illness had to be, or at least contain, iodine. No doubt, one
could cure goiter by the deft use of a surgical knife; but that only
showed that the knife too must consist in iodine. With a heavy dose of
irony, Dr. Mises announces to the world his remarkable revolutionary
discovery: that the moon consists in iodine. He reasons that it must
be iodine because its yellow color is the same as that when iodine is
applied to skin. The analogy seems woefully insufficient to prove his
case; but that is precisely Dr. Mises point: the doctors too often
rest their case on much too little empirical evidence. In doing so,
they follow the hasty and tendentious methods of
<em>Naturphilosophie</em>, which reaches grand generalizations on the
basis of a few examples or analogies. Referring explicitly to
Oken&rsquo;s <em>Lehrbuch der Naturphilosophie</em> (1809), Dr. Mises
complains: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Naturphilosophie</em> is therefore to be not unjustly compared to
a high tower, which has a great many steps, which are called
potencies, which finally lead to a little round space that they call
zero or nothing, from which one has a view of the entire world. (1821:
23</p> </blockquote>

<p>
We would be mistaken to construe these lines as a repudiation of
<em>Naturphilosophie</em>, given that Fechner would continue his
love-affair with that discipline until at least 1824; it shows,
however, that he was already aware of some of its problematic
practices.</p>

<p>
Dr. Mises continued his campaign against medicine in his
<em>Panegyrikus der jezigen Medicine und Naturgeschichte</em>, which
appeared in 1822. With a heavy dose of irony, he sets out three
&ldquo;specimena&rdquo; to prove that medicine is now &ldquo;a star of
the first order among the sciences&rdquo;. The first specimen is that
medicine, in discovering effective cures, has made immense progress
since the days of Hippocrates. The ancient were happy when they found
one medicine against an illness. Nowadays, however, we have infinitely
many medicines against any illness, and one medicine can cure nearly
every illness. This happy state of affairs means that medical
textbooks will grow increasingly thinner, because they will only state
what a medicine does <em>not</em> cure rather than what it does. The
second specimen is that all medications are now being stripped of
their natural qualities, so that all will soon consist in only
artificial or processed qualities. Those who stress the natural
qualities of medicines, Dr. Mises insists, are &ldquo;Rousseauian
primitivists&rdquo; and would have us walk on all fours like the
animals. If nature knew what is good for us, she would not give us
lemons but extracts from them. The third specimen is that nowadays the
preparation for, and practice of, medicine has become much more
effective. The best education for a doctor, it is now finally
realized, is that of the barber, who knows how to wield a knife much
better than any academic. </p>

<p>
Dr. Mises third writing on medicine, <em>Schutzmittel f&uuml;r die
Cholera</em> (1832), concerns public attitudes toward cholera. Here
Dr. Mises was accused of going too far: cholera, the source of
suffering and death, is no laughing matter, his critics contended
(Lasswitz 1902: 28&ndash;29). But his intentions and context exculpate
him. The cholera outbreak of 1831 in Germany, which followed the
pandemic in Asia and Africa, caused widespread alarm and fear. The
causes of cholera, still less the cures for it, were not then known.
One was faced with a silent and potent killer, which affected old and
young, rich and poor, alike. Dr. Mises wanted to calm the hysteria.
Cholera, he argued, was not as bad as it seemed. Although it took many
lives, people had long complained about surplus population; and in
controlling overpopulation, cholera was much more just and civilized
than war, which unduly affected the poor. To be sure, cholera had
curtailed trade and business; but, with all their tariffs and customs,
governments had done far worse. Cholera forced people to become
cautious and prudent, so that to apply medicine against it was like
making a cure for a cure. In any case, not that many have died from
the disease; far more people die of the effects of overeating than
from cholera. For making such arguments Dr. Mises was accused of
insensitivity. But, to be fair, Mises was ridiculing not the effects
of the disease but public attitudes toward them. It was an hysteria
beyond all proportion to the real dangers. Even the point about
reducing overpopulation was directed against the hypocrisy of the
rich: they had constantly complained about overpopulation among the
poor; and now that cholera was thinning their numbers, they had little
justification to complain about it. Mises exposed their hypocrisy in
some telling lines: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One makes arrangements against cholera like those against a wolf who
breaks into the flock; one does so not because one wants to spare the
flock but because one fears losing wool and meat. (1832: 18) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The most serious of Dr. Mises&rsquo; writings is his <em>Stapelia
Mixta</em>, an anthology of essays which appeared in 1824. The title
referred to a plain kind of flower, which was chosen simply because no
one else would think of naming a book after it (<em>Stapelia</em>:
Vorwort, v&ndash;vi). The essays cover a wide variety of topics: art,
religion, mathematics, symbolism, death and the definition and meaning
of life. Some of the essays are straightforwardly humorous: an
encomium for the stomach; the classification of women; the idea of the
art of cooking. Two of them are strikingly original and imaginative:
Mises argues that it is perfectly consistent to assume that there
could be an inverted world the very opposite of our own, where what
are causes for us are consequences in it (in &ldquo;Verkehrte
Welt&rdquo;); and he imagines two lines proceeding in opposite
directions from a single point meeting in infinity (in &ldquo;Extreme
sese tangent&rdquo;). A critical essay on the common definitions of
life in modern biology comes to the conclusion that life does not
exist because all these definitions apply just as well to the dead as
the living (in &ldquo;Ueber Definitionen des Lebens&rdquo;). The most
important of all the essays for Fechner&rsquo;s philosophical views is
his general classification of the disciplines, specifically art,
science and religion (in &ldquo;Ueber das Verh&auml;ltni&szlig; von
Kunst, Wissenschaft und Religion&rdquo;). The three spheres of human
activity are art, science, and religion. Science is the exposition of
knowledge according to logical laws and the idea of the whole; art is
the production of something purposive according to freedom; and
religion is the belief in what reason demands for the justification of
morality. Alternatively and more schematically, science knows the
particular from the universal, the part from the whole; art knows the
universal from the particular, the whole from the part; and religion
knows the universal from the highest universal, which is God or the
cosmos. Religion consists neither in ritual nor in mere faith but in
the knowledge of how we can be active or useful for the whole.
Religion therefore involves, Mises suggests, knowledge of our duties.
Thus morality is not separate from religion but is a special
discipline subsumed under it. Morality is essentially about the
relation of the individual to the whole, which is society and the
state. Virtue consists in acting for the sake of the whole, while vice
is what makes the whole serve individual ends. Bestowing great
importance on the idea of God, Fechner defines science, morality and
religion all with respect to God. Science is the account of how
particular things arose through God; art is the knowledge of the
divine in the earthly; and religion is the knowledge and execution of
duties toward God. </p>

<p>
The most remarkable feature of <em>Stapelia mixta</em> is its defense
of <em>Naturphilosophie</em>. One might think, in light of Dr.
Mises&rsquo; earlier criticisms of <em>Naturphilosophie</em>, that he
is already disenchanted with this branch of philosophy. But the very
opposite is the case. Mises, who here clearly represents
Fechner&rsquo;s own thinking, is eager to defend not only the ideals
but also the proper methods and practices of <em>Naturphilosophie</em>
(see especially &ldquo;Ueber Schematismus und Symbolik&rdquo;). He
readily admits that there have been mistakes in its practice in the
past; but these, he insists, should not be made into an objection
against the discipline itself. What, then, is the method of
<em>Naturphilosophie</em>? Mises explains that it consists in using
mathematical symbols and schemata, which help us to reason precisely
and to visualize the processes of life and the soul. More
specifically, these symbols and schemata are lines and concentric
circles. Although their use is metaphorical, the justification for
them is that all representation of the supersensible&mdash;life, the
soul and concepts&mdash;has to be through sensible means. There is
simply no other way of representing the supersensible, so that those
who want more are just demanding the impossible. Having defended
mathematical exposition, Mises then proceeds to provide an exposition
of the law of organic development using lines and circles (see
&ldquo;Versuch einer Entwicklung des Organisationsgesetzes aus dem
r&auml;umlichen Symbol&rdquo;). We can apply this model not only to
the development of particular organisms, he says, but to the whole
universe itself. </p>

<p>
Fechner&rsquo;s later realization that science could be attained only
by following the most exact methods of observation and experiment did
nothing to constrain the imagination of Dr. Mises. In 1825 Mises wrote
his most fanciful work yet, his <em>Vergleichende Anatomie der
Engel</em>. The purpose of this tract is not easy to ascertain. Mises
imagination runs so wild, his fantasy is so excessive, that one can
only laugh. The work is sometimes said to anticipate Fechner&rsquo;s
later metaphysics, which it indeed does, though at this stage it is
hard to take these extravagant anticipations seriously. The central
idea is that creatures become more beautiful on the higher stages of
creation. Since the perfect form of beauty is circular, these
creatures are circular in form. Such creatures exist on the sun; and
because the sun is the purest light, their anatomy consists in the
organ of sight, so that these creatures turn out to be nothing but
eyes (1825: 10&ndash;11). These higher beings who exist on the sun are
angels. Mises goes into great detail about the anatomy of his
creatures. One wonders whether this imaginary world holds together or
whether it is consistent. Mises says that the heat of the sun is so
intense nothing can exist on it (1825: 57). But then how do his angels
live on it? As if to avoid the difficulty, he then tells us that his
angels consist in nothing more than balls of dust
(<em>Dunstblasen</em>). To give the whole picture a touch of piquancy,
we learn that there are masculine and feminine angels, that they
marry, and in doing so give forth light. &ldquo;Sunlight is therefore
the wedding torches of the angels&rdquo; (1825: 58). </p>

<p>
In 1836 Dr. Mises published a speculative work about life after death:
<em>Das B&uuml;chlein vom Leben nach dem Tode</em>. Neither its
intention nor style is humorous; Mises seems entirely serious in his
effort to conceive life after death. But he does not offer evidence or
proof for his viewpoint; he seems happy to follow the guide of analogy
and to sketch &ldquo;a likely story&rdquo;. It is unclear to what
extent this story reflects his personal beliefs; it is possible he saw
it as only an entertaining conjecture. In the
&lsquo;Nachschrift&rsquo; Mises tells us that the first stimulus for
the idea behind the work&mdash;that the spirits of the dead continue
to exist in the living&mdash;came from conversations with a friend,
one &lsquo;Professor B&rsquo;. Mises insists, however, that he
combined that idea with others of his own and that he gave them a
shape different from his friend, who was more inclined to join them
with religious dogma. Just how Mises&rsquo; idea of immortality
differs from traditional Christian dogma is an important issue, which
we will consider below.</p>

<p>
The basic contours of Mises&rsquo; theory are set by his first
sentence. Man lives on earth not once but thrice, he says (1836: 1).
His first life, which is prenatal, is a steady sleep; his second life,
which is postnatal, is an alternation between sleeping and waking; and
his third life, which takes place after death, is an eternal
wakefulness. The transition from the first to the second life is
called birth; and the transition from the second to the third is
called death. But death is really only a second birth, the transition
to a freer state of being where the spirit throws off its shell (1836:
3). </p>

<p>
The most obscure doctrine of the <em>B&uuml;chlein</em> concerns the
connection between soul and body. Mises tells us that, in the third
life, the soul loses its personal or individual body; but this does
not mean that it is completely disembodied or that it is purely
spiritual. Mises seems to think that the soul must be embodied in some
form; he writes that it loses its individual body and becomes part of
a collective body, which is the organism of the earth itself (1836: 6,
42). Here, then, lies an important difference from orthodox
Christianity, which conceives life after death as purely spiritual.
</p>

<p>
Mises connects the different lives of the soul with different forms of
knowledge. The first life takes place in complete darkness; the second
life shows things in a partial, reflected light; the third life
reveals everything in complete light. Birth leads to an <em>outer</em>
awareness of the world where we see things as external to ourselves.
Death results in an <em>inner</em> awareness of the world where we see
all things as part of ourselves. What we now see externally and from a
distance we will then see internally and from within ourselves. In the
third life, one will see immediately what takes place in the minds of
others and we will not have to surmise it through words and
inferences; each spirit will immediately affect others, because it is
no longer bound by a body that separates it from others (1836: 4).</p>

<p>
There is a fair amount of traditional eschatology in Mises&rsquo;
vision of life after death.</p>

<p>
Even though there is no purely spiritual realm, even though everything
is embodied, justice will still prevail in the third life. The desire
to be reunited with our loved ones after death will be fulfilled
because we will come together as one soul (1836: 29). After death,
Mises reassures us, the self will retain the consciousness of
everything he once knew and did in this life (1836: 7). Whatever he
has achieved in the realm of ideas will stay within him and he will
continue his work in the third life (1836: 8) What millions have
struggled for and achieved in this life will not disappear with death,
Mises comforts us, because it will be inherited and passed on after
death. The justice of creation is that everyone, through their past
deeds and thoughts, creates the conditions for their future being
(1836: 11). There is no heaven or hell in the Christian, Muslim and
Jewish sense, Mises tells us explicitly, as if we would be rewarded
for our good deeds and punished for the bad ones (1836: 12). Its just
that we will continue to work and strive in the third life as we did
in the second. But he hastens to add: this does not mean that the
wicked and the lazy will be able to prosper in the third life; the
claims of justice will be realized in the third life, because the
righteous and virtuous souls will destroy wicked and vicious ones.
&ldquo;The only immortal part of man&rdquo;, Mises proclaims,
&ldquo;is what is true, good and beautiful in him.&rdquo; (1836:
13)</p>

<p>
Mises vision of the world becomes complicated when it turns out that
the third life is not the highest one can reach (1836: 34). The
transformations continue, and we must go through a second death before
we have life in an even higher world. On the last stage of
transformation, which we call heaven, God will reveal himself. </p>

<p>
Dr. Mises&rsquo; last work, <em>Vier Paradoxa</em>, appeared in 1846,
nearly ten years after the <em>B&uuml;chlein</em>. The works were
separated by Fechner&rsquo;s nervous breakdown; the appearance of
<em>Vier Paradoxa</em> was testament to his unbroken spirit. His book
is divided into four sections, each of which is devoted to one of the
paradoxes. The chapter title is a statement of the paradox. </p>

<p>
The first paradox states &ldquo;The shadow is alive&rdquo;. Here Mises
challenges our right to call the shadow a less or inferior reality to
the thing of which it is a shadow. The shadow is supposed to be only
an appearance because it does not really exist. But the shadow can say
the same thing about the human being. It insists that the human body
is its shadow. The shadow cannot believe in the life of the human
being anymore than the human being can believe in the life of the
shadow (1846b: 6). The shadow can regard itself as a spirit and the
human as its body, which it uses for its connection with the earthly.
The shadow has its spirit <em>next to</em> its body, while our spirit
<em>goes into</em> its body; but each spatial relationship is as real
as the other (1846b: 6). &ldquo;Why should spirit not hang its coat
next to itself rather than put it own?&rdquo; </p>

<p>
The second paradox is that &ldquo;Space has four dimensions&rdquo;
(1846b: 15&ndash;40). This chapter is another of Mises&rsquo;
explorations into alternative geometries; just as in <em>Stapelia
mixta</em> he considered lines in opposite directions meeting at
infinity, he now imagines space having four dimensions. Here Mises was
almost a decade before Riemann, who had developed in 1854 a
mathematical theory of the fourth dimension. Mises argues that just
because we cannot conceive a fourth dimension does not mean that there
cannot be any; he dismisses the arguments of Hegelian philosophers who
claim that space must have a tripartite structure. Just as creatures
living in two dimensions could not conceive a third, so we creatures
of the third dimension cannot conceive a fourth. Once we grant a
fourth dimension, we could admit infinitely many more (1846b:
25&ndash;26). How can we prove the possibility of a fourth dimension?
Mises asks us to imagine the world of three dimensions as a giant ball
containing many smaller balls. All the smaller balls move inside it.
But where does the ball itself move? The answer is obvious: in the
fourth dimension.</p>

<p>
The third paradox is &ldquo;There is witchcraft&rdquo;. Mises notes
that the realms of reason and faith have been constantly opposed in
history, and that sometimes faith, sometimes reason gains the upper
hand. During the Enlightenment reason had the upper hand and faith
seemed defeated; but during the Romantic era, faith gained a new lease
on life. Mises finds it unfortunate that faith is now dying again; he
feels called upon to revitalize it; to that end, he makes two
suggestions. First, that witches be allowed to ride their brooms; and,
second, that witchcraft be regarded as the most natural thing in the
world. If we can believe the latter proposition, Mises says, then we
can believe anything; faith will again find its place in the world. So
Mises embarks upon a proof of the proposition that brooms can be used
for flying; the core of the proof rests upon the idea of
<em>Lebenskraft</em>, which does not follow &ldquo;dead physical
lawfulness&rdquo; but works against the forces of gravity (1846b: 62).
Mises&rsquo; proof is a spoof of the concepts and reasoning of
<em>Naturphilosophie</em>. That Mises should let the revival of faith
rest upon such bogus reasoning betrays his deeper allegiance to the
Enlightenment.</p>

<p>
The fourth paradox is that the &ldquo;The world has originated not
through a creative but a destructive principle&rdquo; (1846b:
79&ndash;92). This paradox arises, Mises contends, if one believes too
firmly in the Hegelian dialectic. While Mises always had some respect
for Schelling and Oken, he had none for Hegel, partly because of
Hegel&rsquo;s pretensions, and partly because of his belief in the
powers of a purely <em>a priori</em> methodology. Both these motives
appear in this chapter. The dialectical method is the most important
discovery of recent philosophy, Mises writes with obvious irony
(1846b: 81). It is the art of making right into left by showing that
right contradicts itself; but it is also the art of making left into
right because pure left also contradicts itself by becoming right
again. Because the dialectic is the pure movement of thought, it does
not have to rely on experience or to consider matter of fact; hence
Mises calls it &ldquo;the self-movement of the concept in the
blue&rdquo;. Without presupposing any knowledge of experience, the
dialectician sets his concept into the blue, gives it the negation
sign as a stick, and then commands: &ldquo;Now go your own way!&rdquo;
The dialectical method is therefore M&uuml;nchhausian: it is the art
of pulling oneself out of the bog through yanking on one&rsquo;s own
peruke. One unexplored consequence of the dialectical method, Mises
notes, is that it is possible to negate everything that Hegel
says&mdash;except, of course, the method itself. This means that every
philosopher can be greater than Hegel himself.</p>

<p>
Such, in sum and substance, were the main writings of Dr. Mises. After
Fechner&rsquo;s nervous breakdown in 1843, Dr. Mises largely
disappears. His writings appeared only seldom on the literary stage.
He published <em>Vier Paradoxa;</em> and he edited his collected
writings (1875). But, other than that, nothing. Why? Fechner does not
explain, so we have to rely on conjecture. Part of the reason is that
Fechner now took Dr. Mises&rsquo; fantasies very seriously, wanting to
prove what he once stated in imagination. Where hard philosophy
begins, fun and games must come to an end. Fechner said that, during
the darkest days of his breakdown, only two things saved his sanity:
the love of his wife and his religious faith (Kuntze 1892: 116). He
now wanted to prove that faith as best he could; he was no longer
content to leave it as pure whimsy. And so Dr. Mises had to be
retired. </p>

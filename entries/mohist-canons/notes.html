<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Mohist Canons</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 &ldquo;Canons&rdquo; (<em>j&#299;ng</em> &#32147;) is a generic
Chinese term for a set of concise sayings or aphorisms. It was
probably a purely formal description of the texts, rather than an
acknowledgment of their status as &ldquo;canonical&rdquo; within the
Mohist school. The &ldquo;All Under Heaven&rdquo; book of the
<em>Zhuangzi</em> (Book 33), China&rsquo;s earliest history of
thought, states that later sects of Mohists &ldquo;chanted the Mohist
Canon,&rdquo; as if reciting scripture. This description should
probably be taken with a grain of salt, however, since it is a
caricature of the Mohists by an opponent. It is unclear whether the
reference is specifically to the <em>Canons</em> or to the
<em>Mozi</em> doctrinal essays. More likely it is to the latter, since
the <em>Canons</em> are not the sort of text one would naturally
attempt to chant.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 This article will use the italicized &lsquo;<em>Canons</em>&rsquo; as
the title of the two books of the Mozi containing the canons (Books
40&ndash;41) and &lsquo;<em>Explanations</em>&rsquo; as the title of
the books containing the explanations (Books 42&ndash;43). The
non-italicized &lsquo;canons&rsquo; and &lsquo;explanations&rsquo;
will be used as general terms referring to the various canons and
explanations. Individual canons and explanations will be cited
according to the numbering system in Graham&rsquo;s edition
(2003/1978). For brevity, textual citations will not distinguish
between canons and explanations (for instance, &ldquo;A1&rdquo; refers
to either Canon A1 or Explanation A1 or both). For convenience,
references to the &ldquo;Greater Selection&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lesser
Selection&rdquo; will cite section numbers from Graham&rsquo;s
reconstructed versions, though the interpretations of the text given
here often differ from his and the present discussion does not accept
his rearrangement of the texts. Thus &ldquo;EC1&rdquo; refers to
section 1 of Graham&rsquo;s reconstructed &ldquo;Expounding the
Canons&rdquo; (2003: 245) and &ldquo;NO1&rdquo; refers to section 1 of
his reconstructed &ldquo;Names and Objects&rdquo; (470). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Graham contended that the texts are organized systematically and have
a single unifying theme, but later writers have generally resisted
this view. Graham&rsquo;s theory is presented in his (2003/1978) and
summarized in his (1989), 137&ndash;39. For opposing views, see
Harbsmeier (1980), Geaney (1999), and Fraser (2003). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Though differing with him on many points, the interpretations
presented here are deeply indebted to Graham&rsquo;s monumental work
on the later Mohists (2003/1978). They are also indebted to Chad
Hansen&rsquo;s work (1983, 1992) on points too numerous to identify
one by one. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Graham suggests that the later Mohists held what is in effect a form
of ideal observer theory. He proposes that, through a series of
interlocking definitions, the <em>Dialectics</em> presents a
rationalist, a priori argument that &ldquo;the benevolent and right
are what will be desired on behalf of mankind by the sage,&rdquo; a
moral paragon with ideal knowledge who weighs benefit and harm on the
principle of preferring the total over the unit (1989: 144&ndash;46).
The grounds for this proposal are tenuous, however (Fraser, 2003). It
depends heavily on Graham&rsquo;s speculative reconstruction of a
badly corrupt passage in the &rdquo;Greater Selection&rdquo; (EC2),
and even in his reconstructed version, the connection between the
sage&rsquo;s attitudes and the notions of benevolence and right is
obscure. (The passage could instead be saying that what the sage
desires on people&rsquo;s behalf are things they can surely obtain,
unlike other desires people may have that cannot be satisfied.)
Graham&rsquo;s proposal also requires that we take the ordinary word
<em>xi&#257;n</em> &#20808; (before) to refer to a priori knowledge,
in a context in which it is fully intelligible as meaning simply
&ldquo;beforehand&rdquo;; that we interpret the canon that links
benefit to happiness (A26) as actually referring to desire, not
happiness; and that we posit the existence of an unknown, lost text
giving the missing definition of &ldquo;care&rdquo;
(<em>&agrave;i</em> &#24859;). All of these points are doubtful. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 This interpretation is tentative, because two passages, one badly
corrupt, seem at odds with the doctrine of equal care as summarized
here. The first seems to indicate that social superiors and
subordinates have an unequal degree of care for each other: superiors
care less for their subordinates than vice versa, though they benefit
them more (EC7). The second, corrupt fragment implies that for the
sake of the world, we may care more for a great sage-king such as Yu,
whose benefit to the world was exceptional (EC5). </p>

 &ldquo;Weighing&rdquo; (<em>qu&aacute;n</em> &#27402;) is also
treated in several other early Chinese texts, including the
<em>Analects,</em> <em>Mencius,</em> <em>Zhuangzi,</em>
<em>Xunzi,</em> and <em>Lushi Chunqiu.</em></p>

 &ldquo;Dog-legged&rdquo; is Simon Blackburn&rsquo;s label for this

</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 This seems to be Harbsmeier&rsquo;s interpretation (1998: 186). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Two further observations on this potentially confusing issue: First,
it is instructive to notice the terminology used in Xunzi&rsquo;s
theory of language (<em>Xunzi,</em> Book 22). Where other texts speak
of using language to express <em>y&igrave;</em> &#24847;, Xunzi
typically speaks of expressing <em>zh&igrave;</em> &#24535;
(intention), implying that in such contexts the two terms are roughly
synonymous. Given its pattern of use in the classical literature,
<em>zh&igrave;</em> is unlikely to be a semantic concept, such as
&ldquo;meaning,&rdquo; for it typically refers to intentions, plans,
or commitment. As a kind of intention, of course <em>zh&igrave;</em>
or <em>y&igrave;</em> will itself <em>have</em> intentional content,
and thus the texts can speak of expressing or grasping one&rsquo;s
<em>zh&igrave;</em> or <em>y&igrave;</em>. But the theoretical role of
these terms is clearly different from that of semantic meaning.
Second, in contexts where we might ask for or explain the meaning of a
word or sentence, classical Chinese writers do not mention the
word&rsquo;s <em>yi.</em> Instead, they use the extensional concept
<em>w&egrave;i</em> &#35586; (call, refer). An interesting example
comes from <em>Mencius</em> (3A:5), where one speaker uses
<em>w&egrave;i</em> to refer to his interpretation of a saying:
&ldquo;According to the Confucian teaching, the ancients acted as if
protecting an infant. This saying, what does it <em>w&egrave;i</em>
(mean, refer to)? I take it to be that care has no grades or levels,
but practice begins with one&rsquo;s parents.&rdquo; If
<em>y&igrave;</em> were semantic meaning, we would expect it to be
used in contexts such as this, but it is not.</p>

 The following account differs slightly from that in the 2005 version
of this article. </p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 In some contexts, &ldquo;knowledge by explanation&rdquo; could
conceivably amount to a priori knowledge; &ldquo;a circle is nowhere
straight&rdquo; (A98) might be an example. But the Mohists do not seem
to have an explicit notion of the a priori, nor does it play a
distinct role in their epistemology. On this point, the present
interpretation differs from Graham&rsquo;s, as he proposes that the
Mohists had a conception of a priori knowledge, expressed by the
phrase <em>xi&#257;n zh&#299;</em> &#20808;&#30693; (know beforehand)
(2003/1978: 188&ndash;89). Arguably, however, Graham&rsquo;s
interpretation does not explain the Mohists&rsquo; use of
<em>xi&#257;n zh&#299;</em> better than simply taking the phrase to
mean &ldquo;know in advance,&rdquo; its meaning in other
pre-H&agrave;n texts. His suggested examples of a priori
knowledge&mdash;knowing things about an object before one has a chance
to observe it&mdash;seem more likely to be instances of knowledge by
inductive reasoning. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Graham (2003/1978) contended that the later Mohists developed a
distinctive area of inquiry, which he labeled
&ldquo;disputation,&rdquo; that yields necessary, a priori knowledge
of relations between names, and that this contrasts with
&ldquo;description,&rdquo; or the study of how names relate to
objects. However, there are strong grounds for rejecting
Graham&rsquo;s proposed division of the canons into these and two
other discrete areas of knowledge, and it is unlikely that the Mohists
identify any particular form of knowledge as &ldquo;necessary,&rdquo;
especially since their notion of <em>b&igrave;</em> &#24517;
(necessary, must) does not appear to distinguish between logical
necessity, causal necessity or constant conjunction, epistemic
certainty, and various forms of obligation. For further discussion,
see Fraser (2003).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 As first proposed by Hansen (1983), the Mohists seem to have held a
mereological, or part-whole, ontology, on which the notions of a whole
(<em>ji&#257;n</em> &#20860;) and its parts (<em>t&#464;</em>
&#39636;) are used in place of those of a set and its members. Mohist
mereology is explored in more detail in Fraser (2007a) and (2007b).
</p>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 The ambiguity arising from the several senses of &ldquo;same&rdquo;
is the likely basis for
 <a href="../school-names/index-2.html#6">Gongsun Long&rsquo;s</a>
 white horse paradox: &ldquo;White horses are not horses.&rdquo; Since
the English <em>to be</em> has roughly the same range of senses, the
ambiguity holds equally well in English: If the &lsquo;is&rsquo; in
question is the &lsquo;is&rsquo; of predication, then of course a
white horse is a horse. But if the &lsquo;is&rsquo; is that of
identity, then it is correct that the kind <em>white horse</em> is not
identical to the kind <em>horse,</em> since not all horses are
white.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Canon B66 is important evidence that the Mohists employ no concept
with a role similar to that of the Western concept of essence, for if
they did it would be natural to explain the distinction between oxen
and horses by appeal to their different essences. Instead, they simply
appeal to whatever features they believe allow us to reliably
differentiate the two kinds. </p>

 In this context, realism is the view that the meanings of general
terms are abstract, mind-independent entities called universals, and
that concrete things belong to kinds by virtue of instantiating
universals. Conceptualism holds that the meanings of general terms are
concepts and that concrete things belong to certain kinds because they
fall under or satisfy the corresponding concepts. Nominalism holds
that the objects of thought are just words or imagined images, not
abstract entities or concepts; only concrete individuals exist, and
the referents of general terms are just their extensions. Things
belong to kinds, denoted by the same general term, simply because
language users use the same term to refer to them. </p>

 This section has been revised significantly in response to the
discussions in Stephens (2017) and Fraser (forthcoming). The revisions
involve three main changes. (i) As Stephens points out, several
passages previously cited here as weakly supporting a realist
interpretation could just as plausibly be read as neutral on the
issue. Accordingly, the present discussion no longer draws on them.
(ii) The discussion aims to eliminate any ambiguity about what is
intended in characterising the later Mohist stance as
&ldquo;realist&rdquo; and to pin down more precisely the textual basis
for this characterization. &ldquo;Realism&rdquo; here is not the view
that nature fixes a uniquely correct lexicon of kind names that all
speech communities should use, but that it fixes the
&ldquo;sameness&rdquo; relations on the basis of which kinds can
justifiably be distinguished. (iii) The discussion develops the
distinction between &ldquo;sameness in being united&rdquo; and
&ldquo;sameness in being the same kind,&rdquo; as clarified in Robins
(2012). </p>

 &ldquo;Admissibility&rdquo; (<em>k&#283;</em> &#21487;) refers to
assertions that are &ldquo;semantically permissible,&rdquo; in that
they conceivably could be uttered in some situation without violating
semantic or pragmatic norms. Logical consistency in what one says is a
necessary but not sufficient condition for admissibility.
&ldquo;Perversity&rdquo; (<em>b&egrave;i</em> &#35478;,&#24726;)
refers to assertions that are not &ldquo;semantically
permissible.&rdquo; In uttering them one would be guilty of semantic
or pragmatic contradiction, inconsistency, or other error. A logical
contradiction in what one has said would be a sufficient but not
necessary condition for &ldquo;perversity.&rdquo;</p>

 Graham (2003/1978) claims, strangely, that the notion of
<em>bi&agrave;n</em> &#36783; in the <em>Canons</em> is part of a
different field of knowledge from the notion of <em>bi&agrave;n</em>
in the &ldquo;Lesser Selection.&rdquo; As he sees it, in the
<em>Canons</em> <em>bi&agrave;n</em> is part of the study of
&ldquo;disputation,&rdquo; which investigates a priori, necessary
relations between names, but not relations between names and objects.
In the &ldquo;Lesser Selection,&rdquo; it is part of the study of
&ldquo;description,&rdquo; which provides procedures for consistently
describing, or fitting names to, objects. Against this, we can point
out that the canons on <em>bi&agrave;n</em> clearly refer to
name-object relations, the terminology of the two texts is highly
coherent, and both refer to their subject by the same name,
<em>bi&agrave;n</em> (distinguishing, distinction drawing). In the
absence of any explicit statement to the contrary in the texts, it is
overwhelmingly likely that the separate discussions of
<em>bi&agrave;n</em> are part of a single field of inquiry.</p>

(<em>b&#464;</em> &#24444;) is, it is impermissible for both to be
impermissible. In all cases of distinguishing oxen from non-oxen,
[there are] two. [The one that] lacks the criterion is not-this
(<em>f&#275;i</em> &#38750;).&rdquo; That is, the logical relationship
between &ldquo;this&rdquo; (<em>sh&igrave;</em> &#26159;) and
&ldquo;that&rdquo; (<em>b&#464;</em>) is such that it must be
&ldquo;permissible&rdquo; to predicate at least one of the pair of
something. If we distinguish oxen from non-oxen, then we have a case
in which any one thing must either be &ldquo;this&rdquo; (an ox) or
&ldquo;that&rdquo; (a non-ox). Anything that lacks the distinguishing
criteria for oxen is thereby &ldquo;that&rdquo; (a non-ox). The law of
excluded middle states that any proposition must be either true or
false. The Mohist analogue of this principle is that for any object
and any pair of complementary terms, such as &lsquo;ox&rsquo; and
&lsquo;non-ox&rsquo;, one of the terms must fit the object. Thus, by
extension, any term either fits an object or it does not. Notice that
the Mohist version of the principle concerns predicating terms of
objects, not the truth of propositions. </p>

<p>
Canon and Explanation A74 read, &ldquo;Disputation
(<em>bi&agrave;n</em> &#36783;) is contending over &lsquo;that&rsquo;
[i.e., exclusive alternatives]. For a disputation to win is to fit the
object. One calls it &lsquo;ox,&rsquo; the other calls it
&lsquo;non-ox&rsquo;; this is &lsquo;contending over
&ldquo;that.&rdquo;&rsquo; These do not jointly fit the object. If
they do not jointly fit, it must be that one does not fit.&rdquo; For
a piece of discourse to qualify as &ldquo;disputation,&rdquo; one side
must contend that the thing at hand is &ldquo;this&rdquo;
(<em>sh&igrave;</em>), the other that it is not-this
(<em>f&#275;i</em>). For instance, one side could claim that a thing
is an ox, the other that it is a non-ox. The law of non-contradiction
states that a proposition and its negation cannot be both true. The
Mohist analogue is that a term and its negation cannot both fit an
object. Again, the Mohist version concerns predicating terms of
objects, not whether a proposition is true or not. </p>

 For convenience, Graham&rsquo;s numbering system is used to cite
passages from the &ldquo;Lesser Selection&rdquo; and &ldquo;Greater
Selection.&rdquo; However, unlike Graham, the present article treats
the &ldquo;Lesser Selection&rdquo; as an independent, self-standing
essay. Graham breaks this text into parts, which he embeds in a
longer, reconstructed essay he calls &ldquo;Names and Objects.&rdquo;
There are strong grounds for rejecting this reconstruction, however.
Although the &ldquo;Greater Selection&rdquo; is unquestionably a
collection of disjoint fragments, the &ldquo;Lesser Selection&rdquo;
is a reasonably coherent text. It begins with what is plausibly
interpreted as an introductory paragraph, introduces a number of
technical terms, makes several claims about disputation, and wraps
these up with what is plausibly interpreted as a conclusion. It then
goes on to give a series of examples to support some of its claims. A
satisfactory interpretation of the text can be given without resorting
to Graham&rsquo;s radical reconstruction. </p>

 The account of these techniques given here is modified from the
treatment in the 2005 version of this article. Much thanks go to Dan

 See, for example, Graham (1978/2003), Hansen (1983), Chong (1999),
Johnston (2000), Robins (2010), Fung (2012), and (Sturgeon 2013). Many
other interpretations have been presented in Chinese-language
publications. </p>

 The interpretation below develops and significantly revises points
presented in the 2005 version of this article and in a later,
intermediate interpretation presented in the 2009 version. I thank Dan
Robins for critical discussions about the original version in 2008 and
Donald Sturgeon for convincing me in 2013 that the intermediate
version was unsatisfactory. The present version is indebted to
Sturgeon's own (Sturgeon 2013). </p>

 This point is a major difference between the interpretation proposed
here and those of Graham (2003/1978: 484&ndash;486) and Hansen (1983:

 The text refers to examples of this type as &ldquo;not this but

 Section 1.5 of <em>The Annals of Lu Buwei</em> quotes a Mohist leader
saying that by Mohist law (<em>f&#462;</em> &#27861;), a person who
kills another must die. </p>

 The grounds for the &ldquo;this and so&rdquo; category are obvious
and unobjectionable. Many of the examples in the &ldquo;this but not
so,&rdquo; &ldquo;not this but so,&rdquo; and &ldquo;one this and one
not this&rdquo; categories seem unconvincing or contrived, though a
detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this article. The fourth
category, &ldquo;one universal and one not universal,&rdquo; is
implicitly based on quantifier logic and is probably on firmer
ground.</p>

 See John Knoblock, <em>Xunzi: A Translation and Study of the Complete
Works</em>, Vol. 3 (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994),

 The precise chronology of the Mohist <em>Dialectics</em> and the
Xunzian theory of language is impossible to determine, as is whether
Xunzi himself was directly responsible for formulating the theory of
language that appears in the anthology bearing his name. However,
since the claim &ldquo;killing robbers isn&rsquo;t killing
people&rdquo; is cited for criticism in the discourse on language in
the <em>Xunzi</em> (Book 22), the Xunzian theory is probably later
than the Mohist &ldquo;Lesser Selection.&rdquo;</p>

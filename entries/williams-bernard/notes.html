<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Bernard Williams</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Cp. MSH 156:
&ldquo;the overwhelming Englishness of [Sidgwick&rsquo;s <em>Methods of
Ethics</em>] extends even to a similarity to a cricket match, which has
the very sophisticated feature that one can appreciate the significant
detail of the monotony that lies before one at a given time only
because one understands remote and hypothetical moments of excitement
that might grow from it.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 In his 1983
&lsquo;The uses of Philosophy&rsquo; interview.</p></div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 One might expect
the contemporary moral philosophers who call themselves
&ldquo;particularists&rdquo;&mdash;a label that Williams himself was
sometimes prepared to wear&mdash;to be an exception to this. Ironically
enough, they are not. In practice, few normative ethicists have shown
<em>less</em> interest in particular issues in applied ethics than the
particularists: &ldquo;Particularism claims, in effect, that there is
no such thing as moral theory, in this sense [sc. the existence of a
set of moral principles], and so [?] no such subject as practical
ethics&rdquo; (McNaughton 1988: 204).</p></div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Hare&rsquo;s
prescriptivism is not of course Williams&rsquo; only target; but it is
a paradigm target, so I can usefully save space by focusing on it.
Hare&rsquo;s <em>Freedom and Reason</em> (OUP 1963) is the main text
that I am expounding in this paragraph.</p></div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 In fairness to
Hare, it should be pointed out that he, at any rate, did get round to
discussing which commitments were right, and hence to talking about
applied ethics: see e.g. his <em>Applications of Moral Philosophy</em>
(U.Cal. Press, 1972). Williams acknowledges this (PHD: 83): &ldquo;Hare
has always wanted, and earnestly wanted, moral philosophy to have an
effect, to make a difference. He does not think it an obstacle to this
that on his view moral philosophy is, roughly, a branch of
philosophical logic.&rdquo; Note too that Hare&rsquo;s most famous
pupil is Peter Singer.</p></div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Hare&rsquo;s
rationale for these views differs from Kant&rsquo;s. Hare&rsquo;s is a
theory about what agents do desire, Kant&rsquo;s is a theory about what
agents can rationally will. Any adequate critique of Kant should
register this distinction. Williams 1985 Ch.4 passes this test, but
there are some surprising fails: e.g. Singer 1993: 11 thinks that
Kant&rsquo;s ethics is all about &ldquo;putting oneself in the position
of another&rdquo;, Blackburn 1998: 214 that one of the two things it is
all about is &ldquo;reciprocity&rdquo;. Singer and Blackburn support
their readings by appeal to the Golden Rule &ldquo;Do as you would be
done by&rdquo;, even though the only thing Kant says about this rule is
that he rejects it: Kant [1997]: 38, footnote.</p></div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 The terminology,
in this usage, comes from the sociologist Clifford Geertz&rsquo;
<em>The Interpretation of Cultures</em> (New York: Basic Books 1973);
though Geertz says he got it from Gilbert Ryle. Cf. Ryle 1971: 480&ndash;496,
which contrasts an action that, under the thinnest description
possible, appears simply to be the swift contraction of the eyelid of
the right eye, with, under any of a number of thicker descriptions,
what could be seen anew as a twitch, conspiratorial wink, or parody of
another&rsquo;s twitch. (Thanks to John Mullarkey for the reference.)</p></div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Or whatever. I
incur no commitments here about the right analysis of knowledge, if
there is one.</p></div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Nietzsche,
<em>Twilight</em> [1968]: 69 (cp. <em>Daybreak</em> 132): &ldquo;In
England, in response to every little emancipation from theology one has
to reassert one&rsquo;s position in a fear-inspiring manner as a moral
fanatic. That is the <em>penance</em> one pays there.&mdash;With us it
is different. When one gives up Christian belief one thereby gives up
the <em>right</em> to Christian morality. For the latter is absolutely
<em>not</em> self-evident&hellip;&rdquo;</p></div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Anscombe, of
course, is not likely to appeal explicitly to Nietzsche to develop her
case&mdash;though it is striking how close she comes to
quoting him. (Anscombe 1958: 26: &ldquo;If someone professes to be
expounding Aristotle and talks in a modern fashion about
&rdquo;moral&ldquo; such-and-such he must be very imperceptive if he
does not constantly feel like someone whose jaws have somehow got out
of alignment: the teeth don&rsquo;t come together in a proper
bite&rdquo;; Nietzsche: &ldquo;&lsquo;How much has conscience had to
chew on in the past! And what excellent teeth it had! And today--what
is lacking?&rsquo; A dentist&rsquo;s question&rdquo; (<em>Twilight</em>
[1968]: 25).</p></div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 See John C. Calhoun,
 <a href="http://www.wfu.edu/~zulick/340/calhoun2.html" target="other">Speech
on the Reception of Abolition Petitions: Revised Report</a>, 
U.S. Senate, February 6, 1837,
  hosted at Wake Forest University.</p></div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Of course
this is not the only way of summarising it, and of course my summary
leaves some important things out; most notably, it leaves out the
morality system&rsquo;s commitment to external reasons. But this is
because that is a big enough topic to need a section to itself: see
section 4.</p></div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 At a later
stage in his career, Williams would surely have written
&ldquo;<em>ethical</em> thought&rdquo; here: see 1985: 6.</p></div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Williams
argues in another paper, &ldquo;Consistency and Realism&rdquo; (PS:
187&ndash;206), that no parallel point holds of epistemic demands. It is a
requirement of rationality that epistemic conflicts be seen as
ultimately eliminable; it is not a requirement of rationality that
ethical conflicts be so understood. Hence a contrast between the kinds
of realism that can be true in the epistemic and ethical domains. The
ethical domain is necessarily less truth-apt, which is not to say that
it is not truth-apt at all.</p></div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 Not
Williams&rsquo; example. One example that Williams does discuss (PS:
173; see also the more extended remarks at 1993: 132&ndash;137) is
Agamemnon&rsquo;s sacrifice of his daughter Iphigeneia for the sake of
fair winds for his fleet. As Williams recognises, it is tempting to
object that this example is too culturally alien to us to be of any
use. However, this reaction is a superficial one. As Williams comments,
&ldquo;there is no need of irrational gods to give rise to tragic
situations&rdquo; (PS: 173). It is not hard to see how a warmongering
general or politician might find himself facing a choice between making
some ruthless sacrifice, and abandoning his warmongering plans
altogether&mdash;the latter alternative being attended, for him, with
such shame and ridicule that there is no realistic prospect of his
taking it, so long as he sees himself <em>as</em> a general or
politician. (Recall Sophocles&rsquo; Ajax, whose very identity as a
Homeric warrior is undermined by a related sort of shame and ridicule:
Williams 1993: 84&ndash;5.)</p></div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 Because of
its frequent ironic uses, &ldquo;regret&rdquo; is rather too cool a
word for what I might feel, or indeed for what Agamemnon might have
felt. This is why I go on to use &ldquo;anguish&rdquo; and
&ldquo;torment&rdquo;. I would use &ldquo;guilt&rdquo; and
&ldquo;remorse&rdquo;, except that those words are, at least in some of
their uses, too closely associated with the morality system. Both imply
&ldquo;self-blame&rdquo;, and often remorse about x seems, like
repentance, to involve the thought that <em>it was unqualifiedly
wrong</em> to do x, which is precisely not the point here.</p></div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 A classic
example of this move from a particular to a general obligation is
Singer (1972)&rsquo;s much-debated move from a duty to rescue a child
drowning<em>in front of me right now</em> to a duty to rescue, if I
can, <em>every</em> dying child, <em>anywhere, at any time</em>.</p></div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 So far,
Williams hopes in vain; indeed that day looks further off now than it
did in 1973.</p></div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Williams
liked to quote his teacher Gilbert Ryle&rsquo;s response to a
pupil&rsquo;s suggestion that they discuss logical positivism:
&ldquo;Not interested in isms: we can talk about some things
positivists say&rdquo; (WME 186).</p></div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Because it
primarily considers the agent &ldquo;<em>qua</em> agent&rdquo;, as the
jargon has it, i.e. &ldquo;as a rational agent and no
more&rdquo; (1985: 69), without direct interest in the particularities
of the agent&rsquo;s character.</p></div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 Against
intending/ foreseeing (the doctrine of double effect): see 2002: 101;
against doing/ allowing see MSH Essay 5.</p></div>

<div id="note-22">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 Contrast
Anscombe 1958, who makes it a defining feature of non-consequentialism
to believe in such absolute prohibitions, and so must presumably count
<em>Williams</em>, of all people, as a consequentialist.</p></div>

<div id="note-23">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 1981: 51:
&ldquo;If you want the world to contain generous, forceful, resolute,
creative and actually happy people, you do not wish it to contain
people who uniformly think in such a way that their actions will
satisfy the requirements of utilitarianism.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div id="note-24">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 Albert Camus
in <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em> uses a similar phrase, &ldquo;the
point of view of Sirius&rdquo;.</p></div>

<div id="note-25">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 Indeed the
incoherence that Williams finds in the indirect utilitarian&rsquo;s
justificatory project has, in his view, a much wider importance. At MSH
170&ndash;171 he suggests that it supports an argument not only against
indirect utilitarianism, but against any moral theory: &ldquo;My own
view is that no ethical theory can render a coherent account of its own
relation to practice: it will always run into some version of the
fundamental difficulty that the practice of life, and hence also an
adequate theory of that practice, will require the recognition of what
I have called deep dispositions; but at the same time the abstract and
impersonal view that is required if the theory is to be genuinely a
<em>theory</em> cannot be satisfactorily understood in relation to the
depth and necessity of those dispositions. Thus the theory will remain,
in one way or another, in an incoherent relation to practice. But if
ethical theory is anything, then it must stand in close and explicable
relation to practice, because that is the kind of theory it would have
to be. It thus follows that there is no coherent ethical
theory.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div id="note-26">

 Robert
Burns, &ldquo;To a louse&rdquo;.</p></div>

<div id="note-27">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>
 Skorupski
(2006) disagrees with me here. He says the internal reasons thesis
<em>is</em> the view that, unless I actually have a given motive M, I
cannot have an internal reason corresponding to M. The petrol/ gin case
is then to be understood by cashing out the
&ldquo;corresponding&rdquo;: my motivation to drink gin readily yields
a corresponding reason for me not to drink <em>this</em>, since
<em>this</em> is petrol, not gin. Here Skorupski&rsquo;s task of
cashing out the &ldquo;corresponding&rdquo;, and my task of working out
what counts as a sound deliberative route, seem to me to be the same
task under two different names; there is also the closely related
problem, what it is for me to &ldquo;actually have&rdquo; a given
motivation.</p></div>

<div id="note-28">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 Recall also
Augustine&rsquo;s famous saying: <em>Quia</em> <em>fecisti nos ad te,
et inquietum est cor nostrum, donec requiescat in te</em>
(<em>Confessions</em> 1.1). For a modern version of the Augustinian
idea that all humans have certain desires, and in particular the desire
for God, &ldquo;buried&rdquo; in them somewhere, see Brewer
2006.</p></div>

<div id="note-29">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>
Neo-Aristotelians and Thomists are nearly always universalists,
believing that all humans have the same basic set of reasons.
Aristotle himself was perhaps not a universalist, but the evidence is
unclear.</p></div>

<div id="note-30">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>
 For this
conclusion see Tollefsen 2004: 33: &ldquo;Since the starting points of
correct deliberation are [on a Thomist view] shared by all
agents&hellip; it seems true that there is a deliberative path from
where any agent is to what that agent ought to do&hellip; But since
basic goods are objectively good, the subjectivism of Williams&rsquo;
view is undercut. The resulting picture is not straightforwardly
internalist&hellip; but it is not straightforwardly externalist
either.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div id="note-31">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a>
 Cp. 1985:
54&ndash;64 for Williams&rsquo; &ldquo;simplified&rdquo; and
&ldquo;concretised&rdquo; account of Kant&rsquo;s argument, which
begins from the question &ldquo;Is there anything that rational agents
necessarily want?&rdquo;; see also Skorupski (2006) for further
discussion.</p></div>

<div id="note-32">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-32">32.</a>
 Wider and narrower readings of the internal reasons thesis (IRT) are
possible.  Most narrowly, IRT could be something like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a
reason to <em>F</em> unless <em>F</em>-ing furthers some desire that I
already have, or would come to have if I had full information&rdquo;. Most
widely, it could be something like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a reason to
<em>F</em> unless <em>F</em>-ing is mandated by some motivation that I
already have, or would come to have if I deliberated fully
rationally&rdquo;. I doubt that anyone is an (unconfused) externalist in the
sense of denying this sort of wide reading. Skorupski (forthcoming)
explicitly denies the internal reasons thesis, but is evidently
denying the narrow reading rather than the wide.</p></div>

<p>

My own sense is that Williams is, or ought to be, more deeply
committed to the wide than the narrow reading. One reason in favour of
the wide reading is that it doesn&rsquo;t commit IRT to dubious views about
the role of phenomenologically-obvious desires in motivation, nor to a
flat instrumentalist account of the nature of practical reasoning or
information. And as I say in the main text, it&rsquo;s not an objection to
the wide reading that no one unconfusedly holds its negation. The point
is to expose the confusions.</p>

Singer, <em>How Are We To Live?</em>, p.276: &ldquo;If we take
the point of view of the universe we can recognise the urgency of doing
something about the pain and suffering of others, before we even
consider promoting other possible values&hellip;&rdquo;</p></div>

 A more
interesting and more explicit attempt than Singer&rsquo;s to deny IRT
is Hampton 1998: 76&ndash;77; she denies IRT on the ground that deliberation
involves norms of rationality which generate reasons which cannot be
classified as internal reasons. Hampton&rsquo;s argument why not
apparently depends on the false assumption that Williams can&rsquo;t invoke
platitudes about the nature of rationality without committing himself
to the Kantian synthetic <em>a priori</em>. However, (1) her argument
does point to something important about rationality: its objectivity,
the same feature that McDowell is getting at when he attacks IRT for
&ldquo;psychologism&rdquo;. And (2) Hampton unearths the interesting fact that
there are external reasons in epistemic matters: if p, then anyone who
has epistemic reason to have a belief whether p has epistemic reason to
believe that p, no matter what is in their S, and no matter whether
they could arrive at p by a sound deliberative route from what is in
their S. Williams, of course, will not be impressed by this point about
the epistemic; he will just say that this is another illustration of
the contrast he usually draws, between the epistemic and the
ethical.</p></div>

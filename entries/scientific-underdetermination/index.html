<h1>Underdetermination of Scientific Theory</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Aug 12, 2009; substantive revision Thu Oct 12, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
At the heart of the underdetermination of scientific theory by
evidence is the simple idea that the evidence available to us at a
given time may be insufficient to determine what beliefs we should
hold in response to it. In a textbook example, if all I know is that
you spent $10 on apples and oranges and that apples cost $1 while
oranges cost $2, then I know that you did not buy six oranges, but I
do not know whether you bought one orange and eight apples, two
oranges and six apples, and so on. A simple scientific example can be
found in the rationale behind the sensible methodological adage that
&ldquo;correlation does not imply causation&rdquo;. If watching lots
of cartoons causes children to be more violent in their playground
behavior, then we should (barring complications) expect to find a
correlation between levels of cartoon viewing and violent playground
behavior. But that is <em>also</em> what we would expect to find if
children who are prone to violence tend to enjoy and seek out cartoons
more than other children, or if propensities to violence and increased
cartoon viewing are both caused by some third factor (like general
parental neglect or excessive consumption of Twinkies). So a high
correlation between cartoon viewing and violent playground behavior is
evidence that (by itself) simply <em>underdetermines</em> what we
should believe about the causal relationship between the two. But it
turns out that this simple and familiar predicament only scratches the
surface of the various ways in which problems of underdetermination
can arise in the course of scientific investigation.</p>

<h2><a name="FirLooDuhQuiProUnd">1. A First Look: Duhem, Quine, and the Problems of Underdetermination</a></h2>

<p>
The scope of the epistemic challenge arising from underdetermination
is not limited only to scientific contexts, as is perhaps most readily
seen in classical skeptical attacks on our knowledge more generally.
Ren&eacute; Descartes ([1640] 1996) famously sought to doubt any and
all of his beliefs which could possibly be doubted by supposing that
there might be an all-powerful Evil Demon who sought only to deceive
him. Descartes&rsquo; challenge essentially appeals to a form of
underdetermination: he notes that all our sensory experiences would be
just the same if they were caused by this Evil Demon rather than an
external world of tables and chairs. Likewise, Nelson Goodman&rsquo;s
(1955) &ldquo;New Riddle of Induction&rdquo; turns on the idea that
the evidence we now have could equally well be taken to support
inductive generalizations quite different from those we usually take
them to support, with radically different consequences for the course
of future
 events.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 Nonetheless, underdetermination has been thought to arise in
scientific contexts in a variety of distinctive and important ways
that do not simply recreate such radically skeptical
possibilities.</p>

<p>
John Stuart Mill articulated a distinctively scientific version of the
concern with impressive clarity in <em>A System of Logic</em>, where
he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
Most thinkers of any degree of sobriety allow, that an hypothesis...is
not to be received as probably true because it accounts for all the
known phenomena, since this is a condition sometimes fulfilled
tolerably well by two conflicting hypotheses...while there are
probably a thousand more which are equally possible, but which, for
want of anything analogous in our experience, our minds are unfitted
to conceive. ([1867] 1900, 328)
</blockquote>

<p>
However, the traditional locus classicus for underdetermination in
science is the work of Pierre Duhem, a French physicist as well as
historian and philosopher of science who lived at the turn of the
20<sup>th</sup> Century. In <em>The Aim and Structure of Physical
Theory</em>, Duhem formulated various problems of scientific
underdetermination in an especially perspicuous and compelling way,
although he himself argued that these problems posed serious
challenges only to our efforts to confirm theories in physics. In the
middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, W. V. O. Quine suggested that
such challenges applied not only to the confirmation of all types of
scientific theories, but to all knowledge claims whatsoever, and his
incorporation and further development of these problems as part of a
general account of human knowledge was one of the most significant
developments of 20<sup>th</sup> Century epistemology. But neither
Duhem nor Quine was careful to systematically distinguish a number of
fundamentally distinct lines of thinking about underdetermination that
may be discerned in their works. Perhaps the most important division
is between what we might call holist and contrastive forms of
underdetermination. Holist underdetermination (Section 2 below) arises
whenever our inability to test hypotheses in isolation leaves us
underdetermined in our <em>response</em> to a failed prediction or
some other piece of disconfirming evidence. That is, because
hypotheses have empirical implications or consequences only when
<em>conjoined</em> with other hypotheses and/or background beliefs
about the world, a failed prediction or falsified empirical
consequence typically leaves open to us the possibility of blaming and
abandoning one of these background beliefs and/or
&lsquo;auxiliary&rsquo; hypotheses rather than the hypothesis we set
out to test in the first place. But contrastive underdetermination
(Section 3 below) involves the quite different possibility that for
any body of evidence confirming a theory, there might well be
<em>other theories</em> that are also well confirmed by that very same
body of evidence. Moreover, claims of underdetermination of either of
these two fundamental varieties can vary in strength and character in
any number of further ways: one might, for example, suggest that the
choice between two theories or two ways of revising our beliefs is
<em>transiently</em> underdetermined simply by the evidence we happen
to have <em>at present</em>, or instead <em>permanently</em>
underdetermined by <em>all possible</em> evidence. Indeed, the variety
of forms of underdetermination that have been suggested to confront
scientific inquiry, and the causes and consequences claimed for these
different varieties, are sufficiently heterogeneous that attempts to
address &ldquo;the&rdquo; problem of underdetermination for scientific
theories have often engendered considerable confusion and
argumentation at
 cross-purposes.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Moreover, such differences in the character and strength of various
claims of underdetermination turn out to be crucial for resolving the
significance of the issue. For example, in some recently influential
discussions of science it has become commonplace for scholars in a
wide variety of academic disciplines to make casual appeal to claims
of underdetermination (especially of the holist variety) to support
the idea that <em>something</em> besides evidence must step in to do
the further work of determining beliefs and/or changes of belief in
scientific contexts: perhaps most prominent among these are adherents
of the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) movement and some
feminist science critics who have argued that it is typically the
sociopolitical interests and/or pursuit of power and influence by
scientists themselves which play a crucial and even decisive role in
determining which beliefs are actually abandoned or retained in
response to conflicting evidence. As we will see in Section 2.2,
however, Larry Laudan has argued that such claims depend upon simple
equivocation between the comparatively weak or trivial forms of
underdetermination that their partisans have managed to establish and
the far stronger forms from which they draw radical conclusions about
the limited reach of evidence and rationality in science. In the
sections that follow we will seek to clearly characterize and
distinguish the various forms of both holist and contrastive
underdetermination that have been suggested to arise in scientific
contexts (noting some important connections between them along the
way), assess the strength and significance of the heterogeneous
argumentative considerations offered in support of and against them,
and consider just which forms of underdetermination pose genuinely
consequential challenges for scientific inquiry.</p>

<h2><a name="HolUndChaSciRat">2. Holist Underdetermination and Challenges to Scientific Rationality</a></h2>

<h3><a name="HolUndVerIde">2.1 Holist Underdetermination: The Very Idea</a></h3>

<p>
Duhem&rsquo;s original case for holist underdetermination is, perhaps
unsurprisingly, intimately bound up with his arguments for
confirmational holism: the claim that theories or hypotheses can only
be subjected to empirical testing in groups or collections, never in
isolation. The idea here is that a single scientific hypothesis does
not by itself carry any implications about what we should expect to
observe in nature; rather, we can derive empirical consequences from
an hypothesis only when it is conjoined with many other beliefs and
hypotheses, including background assumptions about the world, beliefs
about how measuring instruments operate, further hypotheses about the
interactions between objects in the original hypothesis&rsquo; field
of study and the surrounding environment, etc. For this reason, Duhem
argues, when an empirical prediction turns out to be falsified, we do
not know whether the fault lies with the hypothesis we originally
sought to test or with one of the many other beliefs and hypotheses
that were also needed and used to generate the failed prediction:</p>

<blockquote>
A physicist decides to demonstrate the inaccuracy of a proposition; in
order to deduce from this proposition the prediction of a phenomenon
and institute the experiment which is to show whether this phenomenon
is or is not produced, in order to interpret the results of this
experiment and establish that the predicted phenomenon is not
produced, he does not confine himself to making use of the proposition
in question; he makes use also of a whole group of theories accepted
by him as beyond dispute. The prediction of the phenomenon, whose
nonproduction is to cut off debate, does not derive from the
proposition challenged if taken by itself, but from the proposition at
issue joined to that whole group of theories; if the predicted
phenomenon is not produced, the only thing the experiment teaches us
is that among the propositions used to predict the phenomenon and to
establish whether it would be produced, there is at least one error;
but where this error lies is just what it does not tell us. ([1914]
1954, 185)
</blockquote>

<p>
Duhem supports this claim with examples from physical theory,
including one designed to illustrate a celebrated further consequence
he draws from it. Holist underdetermination ensures, Duhem argues,
that there cannot be any such thing as a &ldquo;crucial
experiment&rdquo;: a single experiment whose outcome is predicted
differently by two competing theories and which therefore serves to
definitively confirm one and refute the other. For example, in a
famous scientific episode intended to resolve the ongoing heated
battle between partisans of the theory that light consists of a stream
of particles moving at extremely high speed (the particle or
&ldquo;emission&rdquo; theory of light) and defenders of the view that
light consists instead of waves propagated through a mechanical medium
(the wave theory), the physicist Foucault designed an apparatus to
test the two theories&rsquo; competing claims about the speed of
transmission of light in different media: the particle theory implied
that light would travel faster in water than in air, while the wave
theory implied that the reverse was true. Although the outcome of the
experiment was taken to show that light travels faster in air than in
 water,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 Duhem argues that this is far from a refutation of the hypothesis of
emission:</p>

<blockquote>
in fact, what the experiment declares stained with error is the whole
group of propositions accepted by Newton, and after him by Laplace and
Biot, that is, the whole theory from which we deduce the relation
between the index of refraction and the velocity of light in various
media. But in condemning this system as a whole by declaring it
stained with error, the experiment does not tell us where the error
lies. Is it in the fundamental hypothesis that light consists in
projectiles thrown out with great speed by luminous bodies? Is it in
some other assumption concerning the actions experienced by light
corpuscles due to the media in which they move? We know nothing about
that. It would be rash to believe, as Arago seems to have thought,
that Foucault&rsquo;s experiment condemns once and for all the very
hypothesis of emission, i.e., the assimilation of a ray of light to a
swarm of projectiles. If physicists had attached some value to this
task, they would undoubtedly have succeeded in founding on this
assumption a system of optics that would agree with Foucault&rsquo;s
experiment. ([1914] 1954, p. 187)
</blockquote>

<p>
From this and similar examples, Duhem drew the quite general
conclusion that our response to the experimental or observational
falsification of a theory is always underdetermined in this way. When
the world does not live up to our theory-grounded expectations, we
must give up <em>something</em>, but because no hypothesis is ever
tested in isolation, no experiment ever tells us precisely which
belief it is that we must revise or give up as mistaken:</p>

<blockquote>
In sum, the physicist can never subject an isolated hypothesis to
experimental test, but only a whole group of hypotheses; when the
experiment is in disagreement with his predictions, what he learns is
that at least one of the hypotheses constituting this group is
unacceptable and ought to be modified; but the experiment does not
designate which one should be changed. ([1914] 1954, 187)
</blockquote>

<p>
The predicament Duhem here identifies is no mere rainy day puzzle for
philosophers of science, but a methodological challenge that
constantly arises in the course of scientific practice itself. It is
simply not true that for practical purposes and in concrete contexts a
single revision of our beliefs in response to disconfirming evidence
is always obviously correct, or the most promising, or the only or
even most sensible avenue to pursue. To cite a classic example, when
Newton&rsquo;s celestial mechanics failed to correctly predict the
orbit of Uranus, scientists at the time did not simply abandon the
theory but protected it from refutation by instead challenging the
background assumption that the solar system contained only seven
planets. This strategy bore fruit, notwithstanding the falsity of
Newton&rsquo;s theory: by calculating the location of a hypothetical
eighth planet influencing the orbit of Uranus, the astronomers Adams
and Leverrier were eventually led to discover Neptune in 1846. But the
very same strategy failed when used to try to explain the advance of
the perihelion in Mercury&rsquo;s orbit by postulating the existence
of &ldquo;Vulcan&rdquo;, an additional planet located between Mercury
and the sun, and this phenomenon would resist satisfactory explanation
until the arrival of Einstein&rsquo;s theory of general relativity. So
it seems that Duhem was right to suggest not only that hypotheses must
be tested as a group or a collection, but also that it is by no means
a foregone conclusion which member of such a collection should be
abandoned or revised in response to a failed empirical test or false
implication. Indeed, this very example illustrates why Duhem&rsquo;s
own rather hopeful appeal to the &lsquo;good sense&rsquo; of
scientists themselves in deciding when a given hypothesis ought to be
abandoned promises very little if any relief from the general
predicament of holist underdetermination. </p>

<p>
As noted above, Duhem thought that the sort of underdetermination he
had described presented a challenge only for theoretical physics, but
subsequent thinking in the philosophy of science has tended to the
opinion that the predicament Duhem described applies to theoretical
testing in all fields of scientific inquiry. We cannot, for example,
test an hypothesis about the phenotypic effects of a particular gene
without presupposing a host of further beliefs about what genes are,
how they work, how we can identify them, what other genes are doing,
and so on. And in the middle of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, W. V. O.
Quine would incorporate confirmational holism and its associated
concerns about underdetermination into an extraordinarily influential
account of knowledge in general. As part of his famous (1951) critique
of the widely accepted distinction between truths that are analytic
(true by definition, or as a matter of logic or language alone) and
those that are synthetic (true in virtue of some contingent fact about
the way the world is), Quine argued instead that <em>all</em> of the
beliefs we hold at any given time are linked in an interconnected web,
which encounters our sensory experience only at its periphery:</p>

<blockquote>
The totality of our so-called knowledge or beliefs, from the most
casual matters of geography and history to the profoundest laws of
atomic physics or even of pure mathematics and logic, is a man-made
fabric which impinges on experience only along the edges. Or, to
change the figure, total science is like a field of force whose
boundary conditions are experience. A conflict with experience at the
periphery occasions readjustments in the interior of the field. But
the total field is so underdetermined by its boundary conditions,
experience, that there is much latitude of choice as to what
statements to reevaluate in the light of any single contrary
experience. No particular experiences are linked with any particular
statements in the interior of the field, except indirectly through
considerations of equilibrium affecting the field as a whole. (1951,
42&ndash;3)
</blockquote>

<p>
One consequence of this general picture of human knowledge is that any
and all of our beliefs are tested against experience only as a
corporate body&mdash;or as Quine sometimes puts it, &ldquo;The unit of
empirical significance is the whole of science&rdquo; (1951, p.
 42).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
 A mismatch between what the web as a whole leads us to expect and the
sensory experiences we actually receive will occasion <em>some</em>
revision in our beliefs, but which revision we should make to bring
the web as a whole back into conformity with our experiences is
radically underdetermined by those experiences themselves. If we find
our belief that there are brick houses on Elm Street to be in conflict
with our immediate sense experience, we might revise our beliefs about
the houses on Elm Street, but we might equally well modify instead our
beliefs about the appearance of brick, or about our present location,
or innumerable other beliefs constituting the interconnected
web&mdash;in a pinch we might even decide that our present sensory
experiences are simply hallucinations! Quine&rsquo;s point was not
that any of these are particularly likely responses to recalcitrant
experiences (indeed, an important part of his account is the
explanation of why they are not), but instead that they would serve
equally well to bring the web of belief as a whole in line with our
experience. And if the belief that there are brick houses on Elm
Street were sufficiently important to us, Quine insisted, it would be
possible for us to preserve it &ldquo;come what may&rdquo; (in the way
of empirical evidence), by making sufficiently radical adjustments
elsewhere in the web of belief. It is in principle open to us, Quine
argued, to revise even beliefs about logic, mathematics, or the
meanings of our terms in response to recalcitrant experience; it might
seem a tempting solution to certain persistent difficulties in quantum
mechanics, for example, to reject classical logic&rsquo;s law of the
excluded middle (allowing physical particles to both have and not have
some determinate classical physical property like position or momentum
at a given time). The only test of a belief, Quine argued, is whether
it fits into a web of connected beliefs that accords well with our
experience <em>on the whole</em>. And because this leaves any and all
beliefs in that web at least potentially subject to revision on the
basis of our ongoing sense experience or empirical evidence, he
insisted, there simply are no beliefs that are analytic in the
originally supposed sense of immune to revision in light of experience
or true no matter what the world is like.</p>

<p>
Quine recognized, of course, that many of the logically possible ways
of revising our beliefs in response to recalcitrant experiences that
remain open to us strike us as ad hoc, perfectly ridiculous, or worse.
He argues (1955) that our actual revisions of the web of belief seek
to maximize the theoretical &ldquo;virtues&rdquo; of simplicity,
familiarity, scope, and fecundity, along with conformity to
experience, and elsewhere suggests that we typically seek to resolve
conflicts between the web of our beliefs and our sensory experiences
in accordance with a principle of &ldquo;conservatism&rdquo;, that is,
by making the smallest possible number of changes to the least central
beliefs we can that will suffice to reconcile the web with experience.
That is, Quine recognized that when we encounter recalcitrant
experience we are not usually at a loss to decide which of our beliefs
to revise in response to it, but he claimed that this is simply
because we are strongly disposed as a matter of fundamental psychology
to prefer whatever revision requires the most minimal mutilation of
the existing web of beliefs and/or maximizes virtues that he
explicitly recognizes as pragmatic in character. Indeed, it would seem
that on Quine&rsquo;s view the very notion of a belief being more
central or peripheral or in lesser or greater &ldquo;proximity&rdquo;
to sense experience should be cashed out simply as a measure of our
willingness to revise it in response to recalcitrant experience. That
is, it would seem that what it <em>means</em> for one belief to be
located &ldquo;closer&rdquo; to the sensory periphery of the web than
another is simply that we are more likely to revise the first than the
second if doing so would enable us to bring the web as a whole into
conformity with otherwise recalcitrant sense experience. Thus, Quine
saw the traditional distinction between analytic and synthetic beliefs
as simply registering the endpoints of a psychological continuum
ordering our beliefs according to the ease and likelihood with which
we are prepared to revise them in order to reconcile the web as a
whole with our sense experience.</p>

<h3><a name="ChaSciRatLauRes">2.2 Challenging the Rationality of Science</a></h3>

<p>
It is perhaps unsurprising that such holist underdetermination has
often been taken to pose a threat to the fundamental rationality of
the scientific enterprise. The claim that the empirical evidence alone
underdetermines our response to failed predictions or recalcitrant
experience might even seem to fairly <em>invite</em> the suggestion
that what systematically steps into the breach to do the further work
of singling out just one or a few candidate responses to disconfirming
evidence is (even if &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo;) something irrational or
at least arational in character. Imre Lakatos and Paul Feyerabend each
suggested that because of underdetermination, the difference between
empirically successful and unsuccessful theories or research programs
is largely a function of the differences in talent, creativity,
resolve, and resources of those who advocate them. And at least since
the influential work of Thomas Kuhn, one important line of thinking
about science has held that it is ultimately the social and political
interests (in a suitably broad sense) of scientists themselves which
serve to determine their responses to disconfirming evidence and
therefore the further empirical, methodological, and other commitments
of any given scientist or scientific community. Mary Hesse suggests
that Quinean underdetermination showed why certain
&ldquo;non-logical&rdquo; and &ldquo;extra-empirical&rdquo;
considerations must play a role in theory choice, and claims that
&ldquo;it is only a short step from this philosophy of science to the
suggestion that adoption of such criteria, that can be seen to be
different for different groups and at different periods, should be
explicable by social rather than logical factors&rdquo; (1980, 33).
And perhaps the most prominent modern day inheritors of this line of
thinking are those scholars in the sociology of scientific knowledge
(SSK) movement and in feminist science studies who argue that it is
typically the career interests, political affiliations, intellectual
allegiances, gender biases, and/or pursuit of power and influence by
scientists themselves which play a crucial or even decisive role in
determining precisely which beliefs are abandoned or retained in
response to conflicting evidence. The shared argumentative schema here
is one on which holist underdetermination ensures that the evidence
alone cannot do the work of picking out a single response to such
conflicting evidence, thus something else must step in to do the job,
and sociologists of scientific knowledge, feminist critics of science,
and other interest-driven theorists of science each have their favored
suggestions close to hand. </p>

<p>
In a justly celebrated discussion, Larry Laudan (1990) argues that the
significance of such underdetermination has been greatly exaggerated.
Underdetermination actually comes in a wide variety of strengths, he
insists, depending on precisely what is being asserted about the
character, the availability, and (most importantly) the <em>rational
defensibility</em> of the various competing hypotheses or ways of
revising our beliefs that the evidence supposedly leaves us free to
accept. Laudan usefully distinguishes a number of different dimensions
along which claims of underdetermination vary in strength, and he goes
on to insist that those who attribute dramatic significance to the
thesis that our scientific theories are underdetermined by the
evidence invariably defend only the weaker versions of that thesis,
while they go on to draw dire consequences and shocking morals
regarding the character and status of the scientific enterprise from
much stronger versions. He suggests, for instance, that Quine&rsquo;s
famous claim that any hypothesis can be preserved &ldquo;come what
may&rdquo; can perhaps be defended simply as a description of what it
is <em>psychologically</em> possible for human beings to do, but
Laudan insists that in this form the thesis is simply bereft of
interesting or important consequences for epistemology&mdash; the
study of <em>knowledge</em>. The strong version of the thesis along
this dimension instead asserts that it is always normatively or
rationally <em>defensible</em> to retain any hypothesis in the light
of any evidence whatsoever, but this latter, stronger version of the
claim, Laudan suggests, is one for which no convincing evidence or
argument has ever been offered. More generally, he insists, arguments
for underdetermination turn on implausibly treating all logically
possible responses to the evidence as equally justified or rationally
defensible. For example, Laudan suggests that we might reasonably hold
the resources of <em>deductive logic</em> to be insufficient to single
out just one acceptable response to disconfirming evidence, but not
that deductive logic <em>plus the sorts of ampliative principles of
good reasoning typically deployed in scientific contexts</em> are
insufficient to do so. Similarly, defenders of underdetermination
might assert the <em>nonuniqueness</em> claim that for any given
theory or web of beliefs there is at least one alternative that can
also be reconciled with the available evidence, or the stronger
<em>egalitarian</em> claim that <em>all</em> of the contraries of any
given theory can be reconciled with the available evidence equally
well. And the claim of such &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; itself
disguises a wide range of further alternative possibilities: that our
theories can be made <em>logically compatible</em> with any amount of
disconfirming evidence (perhaps by the simple expedient of removing
any claim(s) with which the evidence is in conflict), that any theory
may be reformulated or revised so as to <em>entail</em> any piece of
previously disconfirming evidence, or so as to <em>explain</em>
previously disconfirming evidence, or that any theory can be made to
be <em>as well supported empirically</em> by any collection of
evidence as any other theory. And in <em>all</em> of these respects,
Laudan claims, partisans have defended only the weaker forms of
underdetermination while founding their further claims about and
conceptions of the scientific enterprise on versions much stronger
than those they have managed or even attempted to defend. </p>

<p>
Laudan is certainly right to distinguish these various versions of
holist underdetermination, and he is equally right to suggest that
many of the thinkers he confronts have derived grand morals concerning
the scientific enterprise from much stronger versions of
underdetermination than they are able to defend, but the underlying
situation is somewhat more complex than he suggests. Laudan&rsquo;s
overarching claim is that champions of holist underdetermination show
only that a wide variety of responses to disconfirming evidence are
logically possible (or even just psychologically possible), rather
than that these are all rationally defensible or equally
well-supported by the evidence. But his straightforward appeal to
further epistemic resources like ampliative principles of belief
revision that are supposed to help narrow the merely logical
possibilities down to those which are reasonable or rationally
defensible is itself problematic, at least as part of any attempt to
respond to Quine. This is because on Quine&rsquo;s holist picture of
knowledge such further ampliative principles governing legitimate
belief revision are, of course, <em>themselves</em> simply part of the
web of our beliefs, and are therefore open to revision in response to
recalcitrant experience as well&mdash;indeed, this is true even for
the principles of deductive logic and the (consequent) demand for
particular forms of logical consistency between parts of the web
itself! So while it is true that the ampliative principles we
currently embrace do not leave all logically or even psychologically
possible responses to the evidence open to us (or leave us free to
preserve any hypothesis &ldquo;come what may&rdquo;), our continued
adherence to <em>these very principles</em>, rather than being willing
to revise the web of belief so as to abandon them, is part of the
phenomenon to which Quine is using underdetermination to draw our
attention and cannot be taken for granted without begging the
question. Put another way, Quine does not simply ignore the further
principles that function to ensure that we revise the web of belief in
one way rather than others, but it follows from his account that such
principles are themselves part of the web and therefore candidates for
revision in our efforts to bring the web of beliefs into conformity
(by the <em>resulting</em> web&rsquo;s <em>own</em> lights) with
sensory experience. This recognition makes clear why it will be
extremely difficult to say how the shift to an alternative web of
belief (with alternative ampliative or even deductive principles of
belief revision) should or even can be evaluated for its rational
defensibility&mdash;each proposed revision will be maximally rational
by the lights of the principles it itself
 sanctions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 Of course we can rightly say that many candidate revisions would
violate our <em>presently accepted</em> ampliative principles of
rational belief revision, but the preference we have for those rather
than the alternatives is itself a matter of their position in the
existing web of belief we have inherited and the role that they
themselves play in guiding the revisions we are inclined to make to
that web in light of ongoing experience.</p>

<p>
Thus, if we accept Quine&rsquo;s general picture of knowledge, it
becomes quite difficult to disentangle normative from descriptive
issues, or questions about the psychology of human belief revision
from questions about the justifiability or rational defensibility of
such revisions. It is in part for this reason that Quine famously
suggests (1969, 82; see also p 75&ndash;76) that epistemology itself
&ldquo;falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of
natural science&rdquo;: the point is not that epistemology should
simply be abandoned in favor of psychology, but instead that there is
ultimately no way to draw a meaningful distinction between the two.
(James Woodward, in comments on an earlier draft of this entry,
pointed out that this makes it all the harder to assess the
significance of Quinean underdetermination in light of Laudan&rsquo;s
complaint or even know the rules for doing so, but in an important way
this difficulty was Quine&rsquo;s point all along!) Quine&rsquo;s
claim is that &ldquo;[e]ach man is given a scientific heritage plus a
continuing barrage of sensory stimulation; and the considerations
which guide him in warping his scientific heritage to fit his
continuing sensory promptings are, where rational, pragmatic&rdquo;
(1951, 46), but the role of these &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo;
considerations or principles in selecting just one of the many
possible revisions of the web of belief in response to recalcitrant
experience is not to be contrasted with those same principles having a
rational or epistemic justification. Far from conflicting with or even
being orthogonal to the search for truth and our efforts to render our
beliefs maximally responsive to the evidence, Quine insists, revising
our beliefs in accordance with such pragmatic principles &ldquo;at
bottom, is what evidence is&rdquo; (1955, 251). Whether or not this
strongly naturalistic conception of epistemology can ultimately be
defended, it is misleading for Laudan to suggest that the thesis of
underdetermination becomes trivial or obviously insupportable the
moment we inquire into the rational defensibility rather than the mere
logical or psychological possibility of alternative revisions to the
holist&rsquo;s web of belief. </p>

<p>
In fact, there is an important connection between this lacuna in
Laudan&rsquo;s famous discussion and the further uses made of the
thesis of underdetermination by sociologists of scientific knowledge,
feminist epistemologists, and other vocal champions of holist
underdetermination. When faced with the invocation of further
ampliative standards or principles that supposedly rule out some
responses to disconfirmation as irrational or unreasonable, these
thinkers typically respond by insisting that the embrace of such
further standards or principles (or perhaps their application to
particular cases) is <em>itself</em> underdetermined, historically
contingent, and/or subject to ongoing social negotiation. For this
reason, they suggest, such appeals (and their success or failure in
convincing the members of a given community) should be explained by
reference to the same broadly social and political interests that they
claim are at the root of theory choice and belief change in science
more generally (see, e.g., Shapin and Schaffer, 1982). On both
accounts, then, our response to recalcitrant evidence or a failed
prediction is constrained in important ways by preexisting features of
the existing web of beliefs, but for Quine the continuing force of
these constraints is ultimately imposed by the fundamental principles
of human psychology (such as our preference for minimal mutilation of
the web, or the pragmatic virtues of simplicity, fecundity, etc.),
while for interest-driven theorists of science the continuing force of
any such constraints is limited only by the ongoing negotiated
agreement of the communities of scientists who respect them.</p>

<p>
As this last contrast makes clear, however, recognizing the
limitations of Laudan&rsquo;s critique of Quine and the fact that we
cannot dismiss holist underdetermination with any straightforward
appeal to ampliative principles of good reasoning by itself does
nothing to establish the further <em>positive</em> claims about belief
revision advanced by interest-driven theorists of science. Even simply
conceding that theory choice or belief revision in science is indeed
underdetermined by the evidence in just the ways that Duhem and/or
Quine suggested leaves entirely open whether it is instead the
(suitably broad) social or political interests of scientists
themselves that do the further work of singling out the particular
beliefs or responses to falsifying evidence that any particular
scientist or scientific community will actually adopt or find
compelling. Even many of those philosophers of science who are most
strongly convinced of the general significance of various forms of
underdetermination itself remain deeply skeptical of this latter
thesis and thoroughly unconvinced by the empirical evidence that has
been offered in support of it (usually in the form of case studies of
particular historical episodes in science).</p>



<h2><a name="ConUndEmpEquUncAlt">3. Contrastive Underdetermination, Empirical Equivalents, and Unconceived Alternatives</a></h2>

<h3><a name="ConUndBacDuh">3.1 Contrastive Underdetermination: Back to Duhem</a></h3>

<p>
Although it is also a form of underdetermination, what we described in
Section 1 above as contrastive underdetermination raises fundamentally
different issues from the holist variety considered in Section 2 (Bonk
2008 is a book-length treatment of many of these issues). This is
clearly evident in Duhem&rsquo;s original writings concerning
so-called crucial experiments, where he seeks to show that even when
we explicitly suspend any concerns about holist underdetermination,
the contrastive variety remains an obstacle to our discovery of truth
in theoretical science:</p>

<blockquote>
But let us admit for a moment that in each of these systems
[concerning the nature of light] everything is compelled to be
necessary by strict logic, except a single hypothesis; consequently,
let us admit that the facts, in condemning one of the two systems,
condemn once and for all the single doubtful assumption it contains.
Does it follow that we can find in the &lsquo;crucial
experiment&rsquo; an irrefutable procedure for transforming one of the
two hypotheses before us into a demonstrated truth? Between two
contradictory theorems of geometry there is no room for a third
judgment; if one is false, the other is necessarily true. Do two
hypotheses in physics ever constitute such a strict dilemma? Shall we
ever dare to assert that no other hypothesis is imaginable? Light may
be a swarm of projectiles, or it may be a vibratory motion whose waves
are propagated in a medium; is it forbidden to be anything else at
all? ([1914] 1954, 189)
</blockquote>

<p>
Contrastive underdetermination is so-called because it questions the
ability of the evidence to confirm any given hypothesis <em>against
alternatives</em>, and the central focus of discussion in this
connection (equally often regarded as &ldquo;the&rdquo; problem of
underdetermination) concerns the character of the supposed
alternatives. Of course the two problems are not entirely
disconnected, because it is open to us to consider alternative
possible modifications of the web of beliefs as alternative theories
or theoretical &ldquo;systems&rdquo; between which the empirical
evidence alone is powerless to decide. But we have already seen that
one <em>need</em> not think of the alternative responses to
recalcitrant experience as competing theoretical alternatives to
appreciate the character of the holist&rsquo;s challenge, and we will
see that one need not embrace any version of holism about confirmation
to appreciate the quite distinct problem that the available evidence
might support more than one theoretical alternative. It is perhaps
most useful here to think of holist underdetermination as starting
from a particular theory or body of beliefs and claiming that our
revision of those beliefs in response to new evidence may be
underdetermined, while contrastive underdetermination instead starts
from a given body of evidence and claims that more than one theory may
be well-supported by that very evidence. Part of what has contributed
to the conflation of these two problems is the holist presuppositions
of those who originally made them famous. After all, on Quine&rsquo;s
view we simply revise the web of belief in response to recalcitrant
experience, and so the suggestion that there are multiple possible
revisions of the web available in response to any particular
evidential finding just <em>is</em> the claim that there are in fact
many different &ldquo;theories&rdquo; (i.e. candidate webs of belief)
that are equally well-supported by any given body of
 data.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 But if we give up such extreme holist views of evidence, meaning,
and/or confirmation, the two problems take on very different
identities, with very different considerations in favor of taking them
seriously, very different consequences, and very different candidate
solutions. Notice, for instance, that even if we somehow knew that no
other hypothesis on a given subject was well-confirmed by a given body
of data, that would not tell us where to place the blame or which of
our beliefs to give up if the remaining hypothesis in conjunction with
others subsequently resulted in a failed empirical prediction. And as
Duhem suggests above, even if we supposed that we somehow knew exactly
which of our hypotheses to blame in response to a failed empirical
prediction, this would not help us to decide whether or not there are
other hypotheses available that are equally well-confirmed by the data
we actually have.</p>

<p>
One way to see why not is to consider an analogy that champions of
contrastive underdetermination have sometimes used to support their
case. If we consider any finite group of data points, an elementary
proof reveals that there are an infinite number of distinct
mathematical functions describing different curves that will pass
through all of them. As we add further data to our initial set we will
definitively eliminate functions describing curves which no longer
capture all of the data points in the new, larger set, but no matter
how much data we accumulate, the proof guarantees that there will
always be an infinite number of functions <em>remaining</em> that
define curves including all the data points in the new set and which
would therefore seem to be equally well supported by the empirical
evidence. <em>No</em> finite amount of data will <em>ever</em> be able
to narrow the possibilities down to just a single function or indeed,
any finite number of candidate functions, from which the distribution
of data points we have might have been generated. Each new data point
we gather eliminates an infinite number of curves that
<em>previously</em> fit all the data (so the problem here is not the
holist&rsquo;s challenge that we do not know which beliefs to give up
in response to failed predictions or disconfirming evidence), but also
leaves an infinite number still in contention.</p>

<h3><a name="VanFraEmpEqu">3.2 Empirically Equivalent Theories</a></h3>

<p>
Of course, generating and testing fundamental scientific hypotheses is
rarely if ever a matter of finding curves that fit collections of data
points, so nothing follows directly from this mathematical analogy for
the significance of contrastive underdetermination in most scientific
contexts. But Bas van Fraassen has offered an extremely influential
line of argument intended to show that such contrastive
underdetermination is a serious concern for scientific theorizing more
generally. In <em>The Scientific Image</em> (1980), van Fraassen uses
a now-classic example to illustrate the possibility that even our best
scientific theories might have <em>empirical equivalents</em>: that
is, alternative theories making the very same empirical predictions,
and which therefore cannot be better or worse supported by any
<em>possible</em> body of evidence. Consider Newton&rsquo;s cosmology,
with its laws of motion and gravitational attraction. As Newton
himself realized, van Fraassen points out, exactly the same
predictions are made by the theory whether we assume that the entire
universe is at rest or assume instead that it is moving with some
constant velocity in any given direction: from our position within it,
we have no way to detect constant, absolute motion by the universe as
a whole. Thus, van Fraassen argues, we are here faced with empirically
equivalent scientific theories: Newtonian mechanics and gravitation
conjoined either with the fundamental assumption that the universe is
at absolute rest (as Newton himself believed), or with any one of an
infinite variety of alternative assumptions about the constant
velocity with which the universe is moving in some particular
direction. All of these theories make all and only the same empirical
predictions, so no evidence will ever permit us to decide between them
on empirical
 grounds.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Van Fraassen is widely (though mistakenly) regarded as holding that
the prospect of contrastive underdetermination grounded in such
empirical equivalents demands that we restrict our epistemic ambitions
for the scientific enterprise itself. His constructive empiricism
holds that the aim of science is not to find true theories, but only
theories that are empirically adequate: that is, theories whose claims
about <em>observable phenomena</em> are all true. Since the empirical
adequacy of a theory is not threatened by the existence of another
that is empirically equivalent to it, fulfilling this aim has nothing
to fear from the possibility of such empirical equivalents. In reply,
many critics have suggested that van Fraassen gives no reasons for
restricting belief to empirical adequacy that could not also be used
to argue for suspending our belief in the <em>future</em> empirical
adequacy of our best present theories: of course there <em>could</em>
be empirical equivalents to our best theories, but there could also be
theories equally well-supported by all the evidence up to the present
which diverge in their predictions about observables in future cases
not yet tested. This challenge seems to miss the point of Van
Fraassen&rsquo;s epistemic voluntarism: his claim is that we should
believe no more <em>but also no less</em> than we need to make sense
of and take full advantage of our scientific theories, and a
commitment to the empirical adequacy of our theories, he suggests, is
the least we can get away with in this regard. Of course it is true
that we are running some epistemic risk in believing in even the full
empirical adequacy of our present theories, but the risk is
considerably less than what we assume in believing in their truth, it
is the minimum we need to take full advantage of the fruits of our
scientific labors, and, he famously suggests, &ldquo;it is not an
epistemic principle that one might as well hang for a sheep as a
lamb&rdquo; (1980, 72). </p>

<p>
In an influential discussion, Larry Laudan and Jarrett Leplin (1991)
argue that philosophers of science have invested even the bare
possibility that our theories might have empirical equivalents with
far too much epistemic significance. Notwithstanding the popularity of
the presumption that there are empirically equivalent rivals to every
theory, they argue, the conjunction of several familiar and relatively
uncontroversial epistemological theses is sufficient to defeat it.
Because the boundaries of what is observable change as we develop new
experimental methods and instruments, because auxiliary assumptions
are always needed to derive empirical consequences from a theory (cf.
confirmational holism, above), and because these auxiliary assumptions
are themselves subject to change over time, Laudan and Leplin conclude
that there simply is no guarantee that any two theories judged to be
empirically equivalent at a given time will remain so as the state of
our knowledge advances. Accordingly, any judgment of empirical
equivalence is both defeasible and relativized to a particular state
of science. So even if two theories are empirically equivalent at a
given time this is no guarantee that they will <em>remain</em> so, and
thus there is no foundation for a general pessimism about our ability
to distinguish theories that are empirically equivalent to each other
on empirical grounds. Although they concede that we could have good
reason to think that particular theories have empirically equivalent
rivals, this must be established case-by-case rather than by any
general argument or presumption.</p>

<p>
A fairly standard reply to this line of argument is to suggest that
what Laudan and Leplin really show is that the notion of empirical
equivalence must be applied to larger collections of beliefs than
those traditionally identified as scientific theories&mdash;at least
large enough to encompass the auxiliary assumptions needed to derive
empirical predictions from them. At the extreme, perhaps this means
that the notion of empirical equivalents (or at least timeless
empirical equivalents) cannot be applied to anything less than
&ldquo;systems of the world&rdquo; (i.e. total Quinean webs of
belief), but even that is not fatal: what the champion of contrastive
underdetermination asserts is that there are empirically equivalent
systems of the world that <em>incorporate</em> different theories of
the nature of light, or spacetime, or whatever. On the other hand, it
might seem that quick examples like van Fraassen&rsquo;s variants of
Newtonian cosmology do not serve to make <em>this</em> thesis as
plausible as the more limited claim of empirical equivalence for
individual theories. It seems equally natural, however, to respond to
Laudan and Leplin simply by conceding the variability in empirical
equivalence but insisting that this is not enough to undermine the
problem. Empirical equivalents create a serious obstacle to belief in
a theory so long as there is <em>some</em> empirical equivalent to
that theory at any given time, but it need not be the same one at each
time. On this line of thinking, cases like van Fraassen&rsquo;s
Newtonian example illustrate how easy it is for theories to admit of
empirical equivalents at any given time, and thus constitute a reason
for thinking that there probably are or will be empirical equivalents
to any given theory at any particular time we consider it, assuring
that whenever the question of belief in a given theory arises, the
challenge posed to it by contrastive underdetermination arises as
well.</p>

<p>
Laudan and Leplin also suggest, however, that even if the universal
existence of empirical equivalents were conceded, this would do much
less to establish the significance of underdetermination than its
champions have supposed, because &ldquo;theories with exactly the same
empirical consequences may admit of differing degrees of evidential
support&rdquo; (1991, 465). A theory may be better supported than an
empirical equivalent, for instance, because the former but not the
latter is derivable from a more general theory whose consequences
include a third, well supported, hypothesis. More generally, the
belief-worthiness of an hypothesis depends crucially on how it is
connected or related to other things we believe and the evidential
support we have for those other
 beliefs.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 Laudan and Leplin suggest that we have invited the specter of rampant
underdetermination only by failing to keep this familiar home truth in
mind and instead implausibly identifying the evidence bearing on a
theory exclusively with the theory&rsquo;s own entailments or
empirical consequences (but cf. Tulodziecki 2012). This impoverished
view of evidential support, they argue, is in turn the legacy of a
failed foundationalist and positivistic approach to the philosophy of
science which mistakenly assimilates epistemic questions about how to
decide whether or not to believe a theory to semantic questions about
how to establish a theory&rsquo;s meaning or truth-conditions. </p>

<p>
John Earman (1993) has argued that this dismissive diagnosis does not
do justice to the threat posed by underdetermination. He argues that
worries about underdetermination are an aspect of the more general
question of the reliability of our inductive methods for determining
beliefs, and notes that we cannot decide how serious a problem
underdetermination poses without specifying (as Laudan and Leplin do
not) the inductive methods we are considering. Earman regards some
version of Bayesianism as our most promising form of inductive
methodology, and he proceeds to show that challenges to the long-run
reliability of our Bayesian methods can be motivated by considerations
of the empirical indistinguishability (in several different and
precisely specified senses) of hypotheses stated in any language
richer than that of the evidence itself that do not amount simply to
general skepticism about those inductive methods. In other words, he
shows that there are more reasons to worry about underdetermination
concerning inferences to hypotheses about unobservables than to, say,
inferences about unobserved observables. He also goes on to argue that
at least two genuine cosmological theories have serious, nonskeptical,
and nonparasitic empirical equivalents: the first essentially replaces
the gravitational field in Newtonian mechanics with curvature in
spacetime itself,
 <sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 while the second recognizes that Einstein&rsquo;s General Theory of
Relativity permits cosmological models exhibiting different global
topological features which cannot be distinguished by any evidence
inside the light cones of even idealized observers who live
 forever.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 And he suggests that &ldquo;the production of a few concrete examples
is enough to generate the worry that only a lack of imagination on our
part prevents us from seeing comparable examples of underdetermination
all over the map&rdquo; (1993, 31) even as he concedes that his case
leaves open just how far the threat of underdetermination extends
(1993, 36).</p>

<p>
Most philosophers of science, however, have not embraced the idea that
it is only lack of imagination which prevents us from finding
empirical equivalents to our scientific theories generally. They note
that the convincing examples of empirical equivalents we do have are
all drawn from a single domain of highly mathematized scientific
theorizing in which the background constraints on serious theoretical
alternatives are far from clear, and suggest that it is therefore
reasonable to ask whether even a small handful of such examples should
make us believe that there are probably empirical equivalents to most
of our scientific theories most of the time. They concede that it is
always <em>possible</em> that there are empirical equivalents to even
our best scientific theories concerning any domain of nature, but
insist that we should not be willing to suspend belief in any
<em>particular</em> theory until some convincing alternative to it can
actually be produced: as Philip Kitcher puts it, &ldquo;give us a
rival explanation, and we&rsquo;ll consider whether it is sufficiently
serious to threaten our confidence&rdquo; (1993, 154; see also Leplin
1997, Achinstein 2002). That is, these thinkers insist that until we
are able to <em>actually construct</em> an empirically equivalent
alternative to a given theory, the bare possibility that such
equivalents exist is insufficient to justify suspending belief in the
best theories we do have. And for this same reason most philosophers
of science are unwilling to follow van Fraassen into what they regard
as constructive empiricism&rsquo;s unwarranted epistemic modesty. Even
if van Fraassen is right about the most minimal beliefs we must hold
in order to take full advantage of our scientific theories, most
thinkers do not see why we should believe the least we can get away
with rather than believing the most we are entitled to by the evidence
we have.</p>

<p>
Philosophers of science have responded in a variety of ways to the
suggestion that a few or even a small handful of serious examples of
empirical equivalents does not suffice to establish that there are
probably such equivalents to most scientific theories in most domains
of inquiry. One such reaction has been to invite more careful
attention to the details of particular examples of putative
underdetermination: considerable work has been devoted to assessing
the threat of underdetermination in the case of particular scientific
theories (for recent examples see Pietsch 2012; Tulodziecki 2013;
Werndl 2013; Belot 2014; Butterfield 2014; Miyake 2015, and others).
Another reaction has been to investigate whether particular kinds of
theories or domains of science (e.g. &lsquo;historical&rsquo; vs.
&lsquo;experimental&rsquo; sciences) are more vulnerable to problems
of underdetermination than others and, if so, why (see Cleland (2002),
Carman (2005), Turner (2005, 2007), Stanford (2010), Forber and
Griffith (2011)). But champions of contrastive underdetermination have
most frequently responded by seeking to argue that <em>all</em>
theories have empirical equivalents, typically by proposing something
like an algorithmic procedure for generating such equivalents from any
theory whatsoever. Stanford (2001, 2006) suggests that these efforts
to <em>prove</em> that all our theories must have empirical
equivalents fall roughly but reliably into global and local varieties,
and that neither makes a convincing case for a distinctive scientific
problem of contrastive underdetermination. Global algorithms are
well-represented by Andre Kukla&rsquo;s (1996) suggestion that from
any theory <em>T</em> we can immediately generate such empirical
equivalents as <em>T</em>&prime; (the claim that <em>T</em>&rsquo;s
observable consequences are true, but <em>T</em> itself is false),
<em>T</em>&Prime; (the claim that the world behaves according to
<em>T</em> when observed, but some specific incompatible alternative
otherwise), and the hypothesis that our experience is being
manipulated by powerful beings in such a way as to make it appear that
<em>T</em> is true. But such possibilities, Stanford argues, amount to
nothing more than the sort of Evil Deceiver to which Descartes
appealed in order to doubt any of his beliefs that could possibly be
doubted (see Section 1, above). Such radically skeptical scenarios
pose an equally powerful (or powerless) challenge to any knowledge
claim whatsoever, no matter how it is arrived at or justified, and
thus pose no <em>special</em> problem or challenge for beliefs offered
to us by theoretical science. If global algorithms like Kukla&rsquo;s
are the only reasons we can give for taking underdetermination
seriously in a scientific context, then there is no distinctive
problem of the underdetermination of scientific theories by data, only
a salient reminder of the irrefutability of classically Cartesian or
radical
 skepticism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
By contrast to such global strategies for generating empirical
equivalents, local algorithmic strategies instead begin with some
particular scientific theory and proceed to generate alternative
versions that are equally well supported by all possible evidence.
This is what van Fraassen does with the example of Newtonian
cosmology, showing that an infinite variety of supposed empirical
equivalents can be produced by ascribing different constant absolute
velocities to the universe as a whole. But Stanford suggests that
empirical equivalents generated in this way are also insufficient to
show that there is a distinctive and genuinely troubling form of
underdetermination afflicting scientific theories, because they rely
on simply saddling particular scientific theories with further claims
for which those theories themselves (together with whatever background
beliefs we actually hold) imply that we cannot have any evidence. Such
empirical equivalents invite the natural response that they force our
theories to undertake commitments that they never should have in the
first place. Such claims, it seems, should simply be excised from the
theories themselves, leaving over just the claims that sensible
defenders would have held were all we were entitled to believe by the
evidence in any case. In van Fraassen&rsquo;s Newtonian example, for
instance, this could be done simply by undertaking no commitment
concerning the absolute velocity and direction (or lack thereof) of
the universe as a whole. To put the point another way, if we believe a
given scientific theory when one of the empirical equivalents we could
generate from it by the local algorithmic strategy is correct instead,
most of what we originally believed will nonetheless turn out to be
straightforwardly true. </p>

<h3><a name="UncAltNewInd">3.3 Unconceived Alternatives and A New Induction</a></h3>

<p>
Stanford (2001, 2006) concludes that no convincing general case has
been made for the presumption that there are empirically equivalent
rivals to all or most scientific theories, or to any theories besides
those for which such equivalents can actually be constructed. But he
goes on to insist that empirical equivalents are no essential part of
the case for a significant problem of contrastive underdetermination.
Our efforts to confirm scientific theories, he suggests, are no less
threatened by what Larry Sklar (1975, 1981) has called
&ldquo;transient&rdquo; underdetermination, that is, theories which
are <em>not</em> empirically equivalent but are equally (or at least
reasonably) well confirmed by all the evidence we happen to have in
hand at the moment, so long as this transient predicament is also
&ldquo;recurrent&rdquo;, that is, so long as we think that there is
(probably) at least one such (fundamentally distinct) alternative
available&mdash;and thus the transient predicament
re-arises&mdash;whenever we are faced with a decision about whether to
believe a given theory at a given time. Stanford argues that a
convincing case for contrastive underdetermination of this recurrent,
transient variety can indeed be made, and that the evidence for it is
available in the historical record of scientific inquiry itself.</p>

<p>
Stanford concedes that present theories are not transiently
underdetermined by the theoretical alternatives we have actually
developed and considered to date: we think that our own scientific
theories are considerably better confirmed by the evidence than any
rivals we have actually produced. The central question, he argues, is
whether we should believe that there are well confirmed alternatives
to our best scientific theories that are <em>presently
unconceived</em> by us. And the primary reason we should believe that
there are, he claims, is the long history of repeated transient
underdetermination by <em>previously</em> unconceived alternatives
across the course of scientific inquiry. In the progression from
Aristotelian to Cartesian to Newtonian to contemporary mechanical
theories, for instance, the evidence available at the time each
earlier theory dominated the practice of its day also offered
compelling support for each of the later alternatives (unconceived at
the time) that would ultimately come to displace it. Stanford&rsquo;s
&ldquo;New Induction&rdquo; over the history of science claims that
this situation is typical; that is, that &ldquo;we have, throughout
the history of scientific inquiry and in virtually every scientific
field, repeatedly occupied an epistemic position in which we could
conceive of only one or a few theories that were well confirmed by the
available evidence, while subsequent inquiry would routinely (if not
invariably) reveal further, radically distinct alternatives as well
confirmed by the previously available evidence as those we were
inclined to accept on the strength of that evidence&rdquo; (2006, 19).
In other words, Stanford claims that in the past we have repeatedly
failed to exhaust the space of fundamentally distinct theoretical
possibilities that were well confirmed by the existing evidence, and
that we have every reason to believe that we are probably also failing
to exhaust the space of such alternatives that are well confirmed by
the evidence we have at present. Much of the rest of his case is taken
up with discussing historical examples illustrating that earlier
scientists did not simply ignore or dismiss, but instead genuinely
<em>failed to conceive of</em> the serious, fundamentally distinct
theoretical possibilities that would ultimately come to displace the
theories they defended, only to be displaced in turn by others that
were similarly unconceived at the time. He concludes that &ldquo;the
history of scientific inquiry itself offers a straightforward
rationale for thinking that there typically are alternatives to our
best theories equally well confirmed by the evidence, even when we are
unable to conceive of them at the time&rdquo; (2006, 20; for
reservations and criticisms concerning this line of argument, see
Magnus 2006, 2010; Godfrey-Smith 2008; Chakravartty 2008; Devitt 2011;
Ruhmkorff 2011; Lyons 2013). Stanford concedes, however, that the
historical record can offer only fallible evidence of a distinctive,
general problem of contrastive scientific underdetermination, rather
than the kind of deductive proof that champions of the case from
empirical equivalents have typically sought. Thus, claims and
arguments about the various forms that underdetermination may take,
their causes and consequences, and the further significance they hold
for the scientific enterprise as a whole continue to evolve in the
light of ongoing controversy, and the underdetermination of scientific
theory by evidence remains very much a live and unresolved issue in
the philosophy of science.</p>

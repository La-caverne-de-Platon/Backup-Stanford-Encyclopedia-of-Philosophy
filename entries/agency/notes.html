<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Agency</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a> According to the
<em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, the earliest use of
&lsquo;agent&rsquo; in English can be found in a treatise on
<em>alchemy</em>, written in 1471, where it was used to denote
&ldquo;a force capable of acting on matter&rdquo;. It is noted that
the semantic development of &lsquo;agency&rsquo; has been considerably
shaped by association with &lsquo;agent&rsquo;, which is defined, most
generally, as a &ldquo;person who or thing which acts upon someone or
something; one who or that which exerts power; the doer of an
action&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a> In her main contribution to the
philosophy of action, Anscombe (1957) did not use the term
&lsquo;agency&rsquo; at all. Davidson used it on occasion, but always
under the assumption that agency is, essentially, intentional action
(see, especially, Davidson 1971). Sometimes, the term &lsquo;agency
theory&rsquo; was used to denote the view that the relation between
agents and their actions is primitive and irreducible. This usage is
now outdated, as it has become common to refer to this position as the
theory of agent-causation or the agent-causal account of agency (see
<a href="index-2.html#ThrMetFra">section 3.1</a>).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a> A search in the
<em>Philosopher&rsquo;s Index</em> over publication titles in peer
reviewed and scholarly journals reveals the following. In the period
from 1960&ndash;1989, there are 678 entries for &lsquo;action&rsquo;
and 75 for &lsquo;agency&rsquo;. In the period from
1990&ndash;present, there are 1230 entries for &lsquo;action&rsquo;
and 597 for &lsquo;agency&rsquo; (retrieved on 03/12/2014). For
theories and discussions of agency in psychology, social science, and
anthropology see Bandura 2006, Emirbayer and Mische 1998, and Ahearn
2001, for instance.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a> The <em>generation</em> of
one action by another often consists in causation, but it need not.
Goldman (1970: Ch. 2) distinguishes between four types of
act-generation: causal generation, conventional generation, simple
generation, and augmentation generation.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a> Arguably, there are
actions that are neither intentional nor unintentional. Examples
include foreseen but unintended side-effects and cases in which the
achievement of a goal involves more luck than skill. The claim that
there are such middle-ground actions is compatible with the claim that
action depends on intentional action, because in all such
middle-ground cases, the action in question is either identical with
or generated by something that the agent does intentionally. For more
on this see Mele and Moser 1994; Mele 2012.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a> In later work, Davidson
changed his view on this. See Davidson 1978.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a> It is unclear, though,
whether all instances of agency involve initiation. Setiya (2007:
57&ndash;58) argues that guidance without initiation can be
sufficient for intentional agency. No one denies, however, that agency
can and frequently does involve initiation by the agent. This notion
can be traced back to Aristotle&rsquo;s characterization of behavior
in terms of self-movement: movement that has its source or origin in
the agent.</p>
 
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a> Later on, Frankfurt argued
that the standard theory is inadequate because it fails to account for
the agent&rsquo;s <em>guidance</em> during the execution of an action
(Frankfurt 1978; see also note <a href="#note-19">19</a>). But this
objection to the standard theory played no role in his argument for
the hierarchical account of human agency. Since then, several
proponents of the standard theory have argued that the view does have
the resource to explain guidance. See Brand 1984; Audi 1986; Bishop
1989; Mele 1992 and 2003; Pacherie 2008; Clarke 2010b, for instance.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>  Sims (2019) argues that our mature
concept of &lsquo;agent&rsquo; inherits its referent from a &ldquo;minimal
mindreading mechanism&rdquo; which produces an &ldquo;agential proto-concept&rdquo;: a
disposition to treat agents as a distinct kind of entity. Sims
concludes that the concept &lsquo;agent&rsquo; should not be analyzed
a priori, and that the standard causal theory is false insofar as it
is a theory about the meaning of &lsquo;agency&rsquo;. As suggested in
this entry, it is not mandatory to construe the standard theory in
this way. All things considered, it is more plausible to hold that the
standard theory provides a reductive account of one central kind of
agency: intentional agency. Moreover, the standard theory need not be
taken as reductive in the sense that it is based solely on a priori
analysis. It is reductive in the metaphysical sense that it reduces
the agent&rsquo;s role to the role of mental states and events
(see <a href="index-2.html#ThrMetFra">section 3.1</a>), and it is open
to be developed and refined in the light of empirical evidence.
</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a> Mele (2003: Ch. 9) shows
that this account does not generate a regress of intention formation,
provided that intentions to resolve the particular practical question
can be acquired <em>passively</em> (at the beginning or during the
process of deliberation).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a> There are several ways
to explain the role of <em>states</em> in an event-causal framework.
First, one may acknowledge that it is, strictly speaking, not states
themselves that are causally efficacious, but events that are closely
associated with them, such as the manifestation of a belief, the
formation of an intention, or the &ldquo;onslaught&rdquo; of a desire
(Davidson 1963). Second, it has been suggested that states can play
the same causal role as events, because states belong to the same
metaphysical category. According to Kim (1976), for instance, both
events and states are instantiations of properties (by substances at
certain times). Third, it has been suggested that states can play a
role in event-causation as &ldquo;structuring causes&rdquo; (Dretske
1988).</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a> According to some
versions of the event-causal approach, the action is the relevant
causal <em>process</em>, rather than the causal effect or outcome of
that process. See <a href="index-2.html#ActEveProOmi">section 3.4</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a> One may hold that people believe,
desire, and intend, but deny that there are mental states, such as
beliefs, desires, and intentions. Arguably, one can accommodate this
view and preserve the core of the standard theory by appeal to
fact-causation. If there is fact-causation, then actions can be caused
by such things as the facts that the agent believes, desires, and
intends. For more on this see Mele 2013.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a> As with event-causal
views, there are versions of the agent-causal view according to which
the action is the relevant causal <em>process</em>, rather than the
causal effect or outcome of that process. See <a
href="index-2.html#ActEveProOmi">section 3.4</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a> Volitionists also reject the claim
that agency can be reduced to <em>processes</em> with a certain causal
structure. See
notes <a href="#note-12">12</a>, <a href="#note-14">14</a>, and
<a href="index-2.html#ActEveProOmi">section 3.4</a>.</p>
 
</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a> A common strategy is to
give counterexamples to the claim that a logical connection excludes a
causal connection. For instance, the connection between sunburn and
overexposure to sunlight is not merely contingent: an irritation of
the skin is sunburn only if it is brought about by overexposure to
sunlight. The connection is both logical and causal. Further, it seems
that the logical connection argument conflates types and tokens. The
logical connections hold between types of mental attitudes and types
of actions, whereas the purported causal connections hold between
particular tokens of those types.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a> There is no general
agreement on how this distinction is to be fleshed out in detail. But
it is widely agreed that there are basic actions, which we have to
perform in order to perform non-basic actions. See Danto 1965; Goldman
1970; Ginet 1990; En&ccedil; 2003. For a dissenting view see Lavin
2013.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a> The problem of consequential
deviance is usually solved by appeal to the agent&rsquo;s act-plan
(which is assumed to be part of the content of the relevant mental
attitude). In such cases, the agent brings about the intended end, but
not in the way planned. This explains why the chain is deviant (Bishop
1989, for instance). The problem of basic deviance is more difficult,
and there is no standard solution. But there are several proposals on
offer. According to Peacocke (1979) and Bishop (1989), the problem is,
in essence, a lack of sensitivity, which can be spelt out in terms of
counterfactual conditionals. In deviant causal chains, it is not the
case that different mental antecedents would have resulted in
corresponding differences in the action. Brand (1984) and Mele (2003)
proposed solutions in terms of &ldquo;proximal causation&rdquo;: the
relevant mental antecedents must be the proximal causes of the
relevant events. Schlosser (2007) proposed a solution that appeals to
causation in virtue of content: in deviant cases, the effect is not
caused and explained in virtue of the antecedent&rsquo;s content. This
solution follows from the more general proposal that non-deviant
causation consists in the manifestation of the right kinds of
dispositions (see Schlosser 2011). According to Wu (2016),
&ldquo;intention-mediated attention&rdquo; is an essential component of agency,
and in deviant causal chains the &ldquo;intention-attention nexus&rdquo; is
disrupted.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a> Such outcome views are
not committed to the claim that the occurrence of the mental
antecedent must <em>precede</em> the action. An action may be the
outcome of a causal process that first initiates and then guides the
execution of the action. (See also notes <a href="#note-8">8</a>
and <a href="#note-20">20</a>.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a> According to Steward
(2013), the question of whether actions are events or processes does
have a bearing on fundamental issues in the metaphysics of agency. She
argues that processes cannot be reduced to chains of events due to
their imperfective nature, and she suggests that this poses a serious
problem for event-causal theories of agency, mainly because the
execution of a process requires <em>guidance</em> by the agent (see
also note <a href="#note-8">8</a>). Steward fails to mention, however, that
there are several event-causal accounts of guidance on offer (Brand
1984; Audi 1986; Bishop 1989; Mele 1992 and 2003; Pacherie 2008;
Clarke 2010b, for instance). Wu (2011) proposes a &ldquo;structural theory
of action&rdquo; according to which an agent&rsquo;s exercise of control is
constituted by the process of an intention&rsquo;s causing an action,
guided by perceptual attention (see
also <a href="index-2.html#PerAtt">section 4.6</a>). Wu presents this
view in opposition to the standard event-causal theory. But the main
proponents of the standard theory never claimed or implied that the
agent&rsquo;s exercise of control resides in the causal antecedents,
rather than in the causal process. In fact, most formulations of the
standard theory make no mention of the notion of control and are fully
compatible with the suggestion that control is constituted by the
causal process. So it seems that this disagreement concerning the
locus of control is largely verbal.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a> Related questions
concerning the role of consciousness in morally responsible agency are
addressed in Schlosser 2013 and Levy 2014.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a> The research on
automaticity includes the work on the automatic activation of
stereotypes. Many of the seminal experiments in this area have been
called into question. Several attempts at replication have either
failed or produced only significantly smaller effects (see Harris et
al. 2013, Shanks et al. 2013, and the January 2014 issue of
<em>Perspectives on Psychological Science</em>). There is, however,
also a very large body of research that corroborates the
findings. Even if the effects are small and difficult to reproduce, it
seems rather unlikely that there are no real effects that underlie the
results in this area of research.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a> Levy 2011 discusses the
related question of whether there is room for the notion of
weak-willed action within a dual-process framework.</p>

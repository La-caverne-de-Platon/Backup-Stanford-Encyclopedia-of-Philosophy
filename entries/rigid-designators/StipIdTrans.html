<h2>Stipulating Identity Trans-world, Without Qualitative Criteria for a Designatum to Satisfy</h2>

<p> Kripke discusses at some length a natural worry about rigidity&rsquo;s
commitment to transworld identity. The worry is that in order
&ldquo;to make sense of the notion of rigid designator, we must
antecedently make sense of &lsquo;criteria of transworld
identity&rsquo;&rdquo; (1980, p. 49). A rigidity theorist must
accordingly provide explicit criteria for how any object, with respect
to any possible world, would qualify as the designatum: criteria in
which &ldquo;all reference to objects, as opposed to qualities, has
disappeared&rdquo; (1980, p. 52). Since these criteria are very hard
to provide, rigidity seems unattainable or otherwise
problematic. Perhaps the need for such criteria &ldquo;shows how the
very notion of rigid designator runs in a circle&rdquo; (1971,
p. 146). </p>

<p> Kripke doesn&rsquo;t cite anyone as holding just this worry about
rigidity. But there is a long tradition of worrying along these lines;
so the worry must have some appeal. Perhaps the appeal can be
indicated by way of considerations to be adduced here. The worry is,
at its basis, epistemological. <i>Some</i> sort of grasp on what the
intended referent is supposed to be would be needed to coin a term
that successfully refers. We can&rsquo;t merely scrawl an expression,
pronounce it, and without further work achieve reference by our words;
we need some idea of what a name is to attach to, if we hope to name
anything. We need to provide directions, so to speak, rich enough to
orient a name to a referent for different situations we discuss, as
when we say that so-and-so did this or that but could have done
otherwise. If there were genuine qualitative criteria for individuals,
criteria accessible to us, then they would do the job: in that case,
if we were to specify that the name we coin is to refer to whatever
object has such and such &ldquo;height, weight, and general appearance
in that we can tell by broadly empirical means whether a given object
has it or lacks it&rdquo; (Plantinga 1974, p. 93), then we would
specify enough to allow our term to find its target, so to speak, with
respect to any given world. Historically, some have bit the bullet and
affirmed qualitative criteria in order to uphold rigid reference (Lowe
2008 discusses Locke on just this head; Brown 2000 discusses
Brentano). Qualitative criteria might carry the burden of explaining
how we have enough information to refer, when we name something.</p>

<p>Qualitative criteria may not be the only means of carrying that
burden. The epistemological worry behind a demand for qualitative
criteria is not bound to that specific demand. You might hold that
objects have substantive essences&mdash;characteristics that account
for what an object is, or for what it would be to <i>be</i> that
object&mdash;whether or not you suppose those essential
characteristics to be qualitative. Then you could express the
fundamental worry at hand in something like this fashion, with
Jonathan Lowe (2008, p. 41): &ldquo;It should strike one as odd to the
point of paradoxicality to maintain that we can talk or think
comprehendingly about things without knowing <i>what it is</i> that we
are talking or thinking about&mdash;that is, without grasping their
essences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>You might see all of this as an argument that we <i>do</i> indeed
have a knowledge of essences (Lowe 2008, p. 42n; 2007,
pp. 290&ndash;291). But Kripke (1980) and Putnam (1975) have done much to
throw doubts on whether we have knowledge of essences belonging to
things we talk about. It does not seem easy to say, in any nontrivial
way, what makes you to be you, according to most views about
essences. A common view would be that you are essentially a product of
certain biological parents; but we might not know which ones. Perhaps
we never do. Jackson (1998, p. 50) expresses the usual sentiment:  
&ldquo;We rarely know the essence of the things our worlds denote
(indeed, if Kripke is right about the necessity of origin, we do not
know our own essences).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Should we then despair about achieving rigid designation? There is
historical precedent for that response (John Duns Scotus, for example,
forsook rigid reference; King discusses Scotus on this head:
forthcoming, &sect;3 and &sect;4). But despair has not been the usual
response since Kripke has elevated rigidity to cynosural levels of
attention. Still, philosophers may have been dismissing grounds for
despair too quickly. </p>

<p>It is tempting to dismiss the epistemological troubles at hand by
appeal to the familiar mechanisms of ostention or stipulation, both
associated with the causal theory of reference. But these mechanisms
do not even together settle the troubles.  I cannot simply point to an
object like you and thereby settle designation, contrary to what we
might initially think. Although I can point to an object like you I
cannot point to that particular&rsquo;s <i>essence</i>. Nor can I
differentiate, in pointing, between distinct objects, right where I
point: you, your body, a collection of atoms, etc. If you and these
other particulars are different objects, and if it is beyond my
ability to specify enough to single out your distinctive differences,
then how am I able to attach a name to you by stipulating that the
name is to follow through various possible worlds the one who is you
and not the others to which I also point? This problem, discussed
today under the label &lsquo;qua problem&rsquo;, has been known since
antiquity.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#stipidtrans-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

We speakers evidently need some sort of <i>compensatory</i> device to
serve instead of defining criteria of identity to supplement
stipulation and ostention in order to get your name, say, to keep
track of the relevant object, namely you, whose essence is not fully
understood, with respect to other worlds.</p>

<p>
What resources are available to rigidity theorists to explain our
ability to designate you from world to world?  What compensatory
devices are on the table of discussion?  Various workers have built up
a tangled nest of supporting strands around the causal theory of
reference, in part in order to explain this. Mechanisms often
supposed, for better or for worse, to help to bring it about that our
stipulation, ostention, and so on, successfully guides our assigned
designator to the right candidate for designation, include mechanisms
articulated in both the &ldquo;causal&ndash;descriptive theory of
reference,&rdquo; a hybrid theory appealing to descriptive information
as well as causal factors, and in the &ldquo;recognitional theory of
reference,&rdquo; a non-descriptive theory.  Some theorists also
appeal to the theory of direct reference. Again, none of these
mechanisms for achieving reference appeals to a speaker&rsquo;s ability to
offer a qualitative or similarly rich descriptive account of criteria
necessary and sufficient for designation, from world to world. Hence,
it is not uncommon to acknowledge today that a speaker can use a word
to express just the appropriate content even though that speaker
&ldquo;does not understand what he himself means when he utters his
word&rdquo; (Bealer 2002 pp. 98&ndash;99). Locke despaired of being
able to designate &ldquo;we know not what&rdquo;; but that is just
what most philosophers today say that we do, by way of something like
what Swinburne calls &ldquo;uninformative rigid designators&rdquo;
(Swinburne 2007 p. 156).  Let the interested reader follow up elsewhere these issues
about <i>how</i> words get hooked up to what they <i>should</i> get
hooked up to (for further discussion and citations see LaPorte 2013,
pp. 190&ndash;193).

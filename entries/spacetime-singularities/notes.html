 A generalized affine parameter is defined as follows. Fix a curve on
spacetime and an arbitrary zero point on it; fix also an orthonormal
frame at the zero point, <em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., a basis for the
vector space of tangent vectors at the point comprising four mutually
orthogonal vectors (one timelike and three spacelike) each of unit
length. Now, propagate this frame along the curve parallel to itself
with respect to the affine structure of spacetime. The tangent vector
to the curve can be written at each point as a weighted sum of the
vectors in the frame at that point, the weighting factors being the
components of the tangent vector in the coordinate system the frame
defines in the tangent space over the point. We can define in this
tangent space the Euclidean length of the vector by the standard
formula in terms of the coordinate system, which will always be a
positive number for a non-zero vector. The generalized affine length
at that point, then, is the ordinary integral of those Euclidean
lengths of the tangent vectors along the curve starting from the zero
point. It is, in other words, just the ordinary, necessarily positive
length of the curve according to the Euclidean distance function that
the family of orthonormal frames along the curve determines. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 The technical definition is: a spacetime is <em>effectively
complete</em> if, for every future or past incomplete timelike
geodesic, and every open set containing the geodesic, there is no
isometric embedding of the spacetime into another one such that the
image of the incomplete curve has future and past endpoints. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 The ideal boundary of Geroch, Kronheimer and Penrose (1972), which
uses equivalence classes of inextendible causal curves to define a
causal boundary for spacetimes, suffers from topological problems, in
that it is difficult to define any topology whatsoever on the
spacetime manifold plus boundary. Another proposal, the so-called
abstract boundary of Scott and Szekeres (1994), suffers from problems
of physical relevance so profound it is difficult even to see how it
makes any contact whatsoever with general relativity as a physical
theory. See Curiel (1999) for a discussion of its problems. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Certain gravitational plane wave spacetimes provide good examples of
this phenomenon: an observer traveling along the incomplete timelike
geodesic constituting the singular structure would experience
unbounded tidal acceleration, whereas <em>any</em> observer traveling
arbitrarily close by would not (Ellis and Schmidt 1977). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 This occurs in Taub-NUT (Newman, Unti and Tamburino) spacetime. See
Hawking and Ellis (1973, pp. 170&ndash;178) for a technical exposition
of the spacetime. Misner (1967) offers a delightful guide to the
menagerie of exuberant weirdness this spacetime manifests. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 The conformal structure of spacetime captures that part of the
spacetime metric that differentiates timelike, spacelike and null
paths; like ordinary conformal geometry, it also allows one to
calculate angles between vectors, but does not allow one to attribute
lengths to vectors. Two spacetimes are conformally equivalent, roughly
speaking, when they agree on the possible paths of light rays and on
the possible paths of massive bodies in general (but not necessarily
on the paths followed by freely falling bodies in particular). </p>

 Another type of singularity, recently characterized (Dabrowski and
Denkiewicz 2009) and closely related to sudden singularities, though
conceptually distinct from them, are the so-called
<i>w</i>-singularities, in which the singularity arises from
divergence of the barotropic index <i>w</i> defining the equation of
state of the cosmological fluid. (The barotropic index is the ratio of
pressure to mass density in the fluid.) They share all the puzzling
features of sudden singularities discussed here. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 It is perhaps not malapropos to compare these arguments with those of
Parmenides (ca. 500 BCE, DK fragment 8, lines 5&ndash;11). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 What one means by &ldquo;angular momentum&rdquo; for a black hole is
difficult to explain, because a black hole is, after all, just a
mathematically defined surface in spacetime, and it is not clear what
physical significance one can attribute to the idea that a
mathematical surface physically spins. Nonetheless, under special
circumstances having a high degree of symmetry one can justify on
physical grounds the use of the classical name &lsquo;angular
momentum&rsquo; for the designated property, and the generic usage is
then analytically continued, as it were, to non-symmetrical cases.
</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 The topology of a spacetime manifold is all the structure that
remains after one removes the metric and all matter fields, and all
other geometrical structure definable by them. Topology, among other
things, is what differentiates a plane from a ball from a donut. It
governs the &ldquo;shape&rdquo; of a geometrical space, and determines
what properties of the space remain the same no matter how one
continuously deforms it (<em>i</em>.<em>e</em>., even when the
metrical properties among points change). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 The Zeroth, First and Second Laws as given here are the same as first
stated and proven in Bardeen <em>et al</em>. (1973). See Wald and Gao
(2001) for extended discussion and the most rigorous proofs currently
known of the First and Second Laws, and Wald (1994) for the same for
the Zeroth. The form of the Third Law given here is due to Israel
(1986); see Wald (1997) for a discussion of its physical problems,
which are much more severe than those of any of the others. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 See, for example, the remarks in Bardeen, Carter and Hawking (1973),
Carter (1973) and Israel (1973), which are not explicitly directed at
Bekenstein though he was, as Israel (1987) reports, their unspoken
target. In the same place Israel reports that, with the benefit of
hindsight after the discovery of the Hawking mechanism, Bekenstein
felt that his proposal had failed because it was not
&ldquo;crazy&rdquo; enough: he had not been willing to identify the
black hole&apos;s physical temperature with its surface gravity.
Geroch&apos;s thought experiment, discussed in
 <a href="index-2.html#PossViol">Section 5.4.2</a>,
 had driven him to conclude that the identification was insupportable.
</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 This question should be carefully distinguished from that of whether
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics can be meaningfully applied
to model the behavior of self-gravitating systems composed of ordinary
matter, such as galaxies; see, <em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Callender
(2011). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Geroch&apos;s proposed process has become an infamous touchstone in
the field, that all arguments about black hole thermodynamics must
prove themselves against. The details of the 1970 colloquium were
kindly verified by Wald and Bekenstein separately (both of whom were
there), in private correspondence with the author of this entry. When
the author asked Geroch about it, he demurred. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 There other, more technical problems with Bekenstein&apos;s (1981)
original proposal for a universal entropy bound, primarily that it is
not covariantly defined, and so suffers serious ambiguity in its
characterization of the &ldquo;size&rdquo; of a system. Bousso (1999a,
1999b) subsequently proposed a covariantly defined bound, with
stronger physical arguments in support of it. It is this bound that
has now become the standard in discussions of holography. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 Vehement opposition to the idea arose before the ink was dry on its
initial proposal in print. See, for example, Davies and Taylor (1974).
It was only gradually over the next two years, after several
alternative derivations were produced more consonant with conventional
quantum field theory (<em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., those of Wald 1975 and
Hartle and Hawking 1976), that acceptance of Hawking&apos;s result
became widespread. </p>

<p>
It seems not to be well known, though Hawking (1987) himself has
reported it, that the inspiration for the investigation that resulted
in the discovery of Hawking radiation came from discussions he had had
with Zel&rsquo;dovi&ccirc; and Starobinsky in September of 1973 in
Moscow, in which they convinced him that the phenomenon known as
super-radiance ought to induce a rotating black hole to radiate. (See,
<em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Wald 1984 for an account of the phenomenon.)
These discussion were themselves based on the previous work of
Zel&rsquo;dovi&ccirc; (1970) himself, Zel&rsquo;dovi&ccirc; and
Pitaevski&icirc; (1971), and Misner (1972). Page (2005) gives an
interesting discussion of the early history of the development and
reception of Hawking radiation, as well as a brief introduction to its
technical aspects, collecting in one convenient place the basic,
useful formulae of the topic. </p>

<p>
It is also worth remarking here that, as first pointed out by Davies
(1975) (who was expanding on earlier work by Fulling 1973), and
clarified and explained by Unruh (1976), a uniformly accelerating
observer moving in the standard vacuum state in Minkowski spacetime
will observe herself to be immersed in a thermal bath of radiative
particles, with a temperature proportional to the magnitude of her
acceleration. This is known as the <em>Unruh Effect</em>. (See,
<em>e</em>.<em>g</em>., Wald 1994, ch.~5, for a thorough technical
exposition, and Earman 2011 for one geared for a philosophical
audience.) The phenomenon is conceptually and physically distinct from
that of Hawking radiation and, indeed, occurs so far from black holes
as to manifest itself in Minkowski spacetime. One major difference is
that the Unruh effect depends essentially on the presence of an
accelerated object for the radiative phenomena to
&ldquo;appear&rdquo;, whereas Hawking radiation occurs whether there
are other observers present to detect it or not, and in particular
does not depend on the state of motion of any other physical system
such as an observer. This difference is most immediately and
importantly reflected in the fact that black holes lose
mass-energy&mdash;an invariant phenomenon&mdash; by the emission of
Hawking radiation, whereas no physical system loses mass-energy in the
Unruh effect. Still, the phenomena are intimately related in several
ways; in fact, Unruh himself derived and explained the effect in an
attempt to gain insight into Hawking&apos;s then recent proposal of
black-hole radiance. It also plays an important role in many
contemporary arguments about gravitational entropy and the Generalized
Second Law. </p>

<p>
Finally, there is another remarkable phenomenon of seemingly anomalous
radiance in the arena of quantum field theory and relativity. As
Davies and Fulling (1977) showed, a mirror moving with non-uniform
acceleration through Minkowski spacetime will, on account of the
interaction between the mirror and zero-point fluctuations of a
quantum field, emit a flux of negative energy in the direction of
increasing acceleration, and (to conserve energy) a flux of positive
energy in the opposite direction. In fact, this phenomenon is closely
related to the Unruh Effect. Israel (1998), for example, sketches an
intuitive, illuminating explanation of the Unruh Effect in its terms.
It is, sadly, beyond the scope of this article to discuss these
phenomena further. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Here is a very brief technical explanation for those familiar with
quantum theory. The parts of a quantum field in the interior and the
exterior of the black hole will generally be entangled.
Microcausality, however, implies that the entangled degrees of freedom
in the black hole cannot coherently recombine with those in the
external universe. Thus once the black hole has completely evaporated
away, those entanglements will have vanished and the entropy of the
universe will have increased, in violation of unitary evolution. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 Several speculative extensions of the Standard Model of quantum field
theory, especially those with so-called chiral anomalies, predict that
lepton and baryon number need not be conserved. There is no
experimental evidence in favor of any of those extensions, however,
and none of the predicted violations are on the scale that black-hole
evaporation would seem to yield. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 The sentiment is perhaps most piquantly captured by Eddington (1935:
74, ch. 4): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The law that entropy always increases&mdash;the second law of
thermodynamics&mdash;holds, I think, the supreme position among the
laws of Nature. If someone points out to you that your pet theory of
the universe is in disagreement with Maxwell&rsquo;s
equations&mdash;then so much the worse for Maxwell&rsquo;s equations.
If it is found to be contradicted by observation&mdash;well, these
experimentalists bungle things some times. But if your theory is found
to be against the second law of thermodynamics I can give you no hope;
there is nothing for it but to collapse in deepest humiliation. </p>
</blockquote>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 It does not seem as though it can bear directly on the issue of the
development of order and structure at much smaller scales, such as the
genesis of life. See, again, Schr&ouml;dinger (1944) for a marvelous
discussion of this problem. </p>

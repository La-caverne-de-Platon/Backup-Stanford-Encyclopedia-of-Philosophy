<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Platonism in Metaphysics</a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1" id="note-1">1.</a>
 This is the most standard way to define the terms
&lsquo;platonism&rsquo; and &lsquo;abstract object&rsquo;, but there
are other definitions in the literature. E.g., some philosophers
choose to define them in terms of non-spatiality but not
non-temporality; and some would argue that on this definition, the nature of an
abstract object could change. Moreover, it is also worth
noting that on some definitions of &lsquo;physical object&rsquo;,
abstract objects could be physical; e.g., on one view, an object
counts as a <em>physical object</em> just in case its existence is
entailed by (true or accepted) physical theory; on this usage,
abstract objects could be physical.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2" id="note-2">2.</a>
 One might think that something is missing from this new version of
the One Over Many, for one might think that part of the problem is to
account for how two different things could <em>share a
nature</em>. But I think people like Devitt would say that if you can
account for how object <em>a</em> is <em>F</em> and also for how
<em>b</em> is <em>F</em>, then you <em>have</em> accounted for how
<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> share a nature.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3" id="note-3">3.</a>  It is worth pausing to
note why this principle says only that we're committed by the singular
terms in <em>simple</em> sentences and the existential quantifiers
in <em>existential</em> sentences. The reason is that some singular
terms and existential quantifiers are not ontologically
committing. For instance, if I say &lsquo;If Santa Claus lives at the
North Pole, then we should be able to find him&rsquo;, I have not
committed to the existence of Santa Claus; and if I say &lsquo;If
there is a God, then there is a tooth fairy&rsquo;, I have not
committed to the existence of a God or a tooth fairy. This problem is
avoided by concentrating on (a) singular terms within simple
sentences, or atomic sentences, i.e., sentences of form
&lsquo;<i>a</i> is <i>F</i>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<i>a</i>
is <i>R</i>-related to <i>b</i>&rsquo;, &lsquo;a, b, and c are
<i>S</i>-related&rsquo;, etc.; and (b) existential quantifiers in what I am
calling existential sentences, i.e., sentences in which the
existential quantifier is the <em>main logical operator</em>, i.e.,
sentences of the form &lsquo;There is an object such
that&hellip;&rsquo;. Now, it would be wrong to say that these are the
only sentences that are ontologically committing &mdash; e.g., we're
committed by the singular term and existential quantifier in the
sentence &lsquo;Mars is a planet and there exist some teeth&rsquo;,
and this sentence doesn't fit into category (a) or (b) &mdash; but for
present purposes, we can ignore such sentences and concentrate on
sentences in categories (a) and (b).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4" id="note-4">4.</a>
 Maddy did not take mathematical objects to exist outside of
spacetime, so her view was not a version of platonism, as that view
has been defined here. But I include her in this list, because on some
definitions, she might count as a platonist, and she is often thought
of as something like a platonist. In any event, we can say that her
view has <em>platonistic leanings</em>, as is clear from the fact that
it entails the existence of mathematical objects that are non-mental
and, in some sense or other, non-physical (in particular, there is
more to Maddian sets than the physical stuff that makes up their members).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5" id="note-5">5.</a>
 Of course, some things are <em>supposed to</em> exist only in our
heads, e.g., beliefs; thus, to say that a belief exists only in
someone's head is not to say that it doesn't exist. But for things
that aren't supposed to exist only in our heads &mdash; objective
things like buildings and numbers &mdash; to say that they exist only
in our heads is equivalent to saying that they don't exist.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6" id="note-6">6.</a>
 One might doubt that this paraphrase is really nominalistic; for it
would seem to commit people to things like sentences and mathematical theories,
and one might argue that these things are best thought of as abstract
objects.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7" id="note-7">7.</a>
 In addition to fictionalism, there is a second (much more radical)
way to claim that our mathematical theories are not true: one could
endorse a <em>non-cognitivist</em> view of mathematics, claiming that
sentences like &lsquo;3 is prime&rsquo; don't really say anything at
all and, hence, aren't the sorts of things that have truth values. One
such view is <em>game formalism</em>, which holds that mathematics is
a game of symbol manipulation and that, e.g., &lsquo;3 is prime&rsquo;
is one of the &ldquo;legal results&rdquo; of the game of
arithmetic. This view was defended by Heine and Thomae and attacked
vigorously by Frege (see Frege 1893-1903, sections 88-131). One might
also interpret Wittgenstein's (1956) philosophy of mathematics as
non-cognitivist, although this is controversial.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8" id="note-8">8.</a>  Someone like Davidson
(1967) might claim that Boris believes the English sentence token
(i.e., the one in the belief report) in virtue of the fact that it
says-the-same as Russian sentence tokens that he believes. But the
problem with this is that Boris has lots of beliefs that don't
correspond to any Russian sentence tokens. For instance, he presumably
believes that 17.427 is greater than 13.961; but it's unlikely that
there has ever been a Russian sentence token that says this.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9" id="note-9">9.</a>
 It needs to be kept in mind here that in formulating this argument
for the existence of propositions, platonists do not commit to the
view that <em>all</em> &lsquo;that&rsquo;-clauses are singular terms
that denote propositions. Consider, e.g., the sentence &lsquo;Ralph
fears that the killer is coming&rsquo;. One might very well doubt that
this sentence says that Ralph fears a proposition; after all, since
propositions are abstract objects, they are causally inert, and so
they are not very scary &mdash; for instance, they can't shoot
people. One might take this as evidence that the
&lsquo;that&rsquo;-clause in the above sentence (that is, in
&lsquo;Ralph fears that the killer is coming&rsquo;) does not denote
(or purport to denote) a proposition, and indeed, one might take it as
evidence that this &lsquo;that&rsquo;-clause isn't a singular term at
all. There are a number of ways that platonists could try to respond
to this: they might try to argue that despite appearances, the above
&lsquo;that&rsquo;-clause does denote a proposition; or they might
admit that it doesn't denote a proposition (they might even admit that
it's not a singular term at all) and then argue that this doesn't
undermine the claim that the &lsquo;that&rsquo;-clauses in belief
ascriptions denote propositions. We won't pursue the question of how
platonists ought to respond to challenges of this kind.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10" id="note-10">10.</a>
 There is another sort of nominalist view that platonists of this sort
would have to refute, namely, <em>trope theory</em>. (This view goes
back at least to William of Ockham, but some people attribute this
view, and not immanent realism, to Aristotle; others have attributed
the view to Locke, Berkeley, and Hume; in any event, the view has been
endorsed more recently by Stout (1914), Williams (1953), and Campbell
(1990).)  Trope theory holds that, e.g., red things are red because
they have red tropes existing in them, where a trope is something like
a particular aspect of a thing. Thus, trope theory is a bit like
immanent realism, except that tropes are <em>particulars</em>. So
whereas immanent realists maintain that red things are red because
redness exists in them, trope theorists maintain that red things are
red because red tropes exist in them; but the difference is that
immanent realists maintain that one and the same thing (redness)
exists in all red things, whereas trope theorists maintain that each
red thing has its own trope. (Note that trope theory counts as a
nominalist view (i.e., an anti-realist view) about properties, but
that this is solely because properties are defined as universals. In a
broader sense, trope theory is every bit as realist as immanent
realism is, because tropes are just as real, according to trope
theory, as properties are according to immanent realism, or for that
matter, platonism.)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11" id="note-11">11.</a>
 One might try to push the regress argument against platonists here,
but it's not clear that it would succeed. If platonists say that
<em>a</em> stands in the exemplification relation to <em>F</em>ness,
one might ask: &ldquo;How are <em>a</em> and <em>F</em>ness related to
the exemplification relation?&rdquo; But it's not clear that
platonists can't just say that they exemplify it. There are worries
that one might have about this view, but I won't pursue this here.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12" id="note-12">12.</a>
 Platonists about properties who <em>don't</em> claim that properties
are components of propositions could also try to argue that immanent
realism is false because there are uninstantiated properties. They
might do this by arguing for the literal, face-value truth of sentences like
&lsquo;The property of being a four-hundred-story building is not
instantiated, but it might have been&rsquo;. But one might think it
would be harder to argue for the face-value truth of sentences like this
than sentences like &lsquo;Johnny believes that there is a
four-hundred-story building in Sally's backyard&rsquo;.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13" id="note-13">13.</a>
 Frege's view entailed that for every predicate, there is a concept
and an extension of that concept, and as Russell pointed out in a
letter to Frege, this leads to contradiction. Contemporary Fregeans,
such as Boolos (1986-87), Wright (1983), and Anderson and Zalta
(2004), have found ways to avoid the contradiction.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14" id="note-14">14.</a>
 It might seem that if stories are best thought of as abstract
objects, then fictionalism about things like mathematical objects and
propositions is not a genuinely nominalistic view, because
fictionalism seems to commit to the truth of sentences like
&ldquo;&lsquo;3 is prime&rsquo; is true in the story of
mathematics.&rdquo; But fictionalists can avoid this worry by taking a
fictionalistic attitude about stories, or fictions.  It might seem
that this would lead them into an unacceptable regress, but it does
not; for a discussion of this issue, see Balaguer (1998a).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-15" id="note-15">15.</a> This interpretation of
G&ouml;del is a bit controversial. Evidence for it comes not just from
his (1964), but also from his (1951). For more on the interpretation
of G&ouml;del, see Parsons (1995) and van Atten and Kennedy
(2003).</p>

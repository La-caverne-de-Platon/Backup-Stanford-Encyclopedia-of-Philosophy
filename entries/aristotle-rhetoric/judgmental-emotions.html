<h2>Judgemental and Non-Judgemental Accounts of Aristotelian Emotions</h2>

<p>
It is generally acknowledged as a major achievement of the
<em>Rhetoric</em>&rsquo;s discussion of emotions that the particular
types of emotions are defined by their objects and are thus pictured
as having cognitive content. Indeed, Chapters 2-11 of
<em>Rhetoric</em> II define several types of emotions (see
 &sect;<a href="index-2.html#StruRhet">2</a>
 above) in terms of the focal properties of each particular type of
emotion and the typical objects at which each is directed (for an
in-depth discussion of the most important types of emotions see
Konstan 2006). Anger e.g. is always directed at what someone takes to
be an insult, fear at what appears to be an imminent painful or
destructive evil, pity at what one regards as undeserved misfortune,
etc. This trait of the <em>Rhetoric</em>&rsquo;s discussion of
emotions seems to mark a significant development within the philosophy
of emotions in general, but it also seems to be particularly important
for the method of rhetorical persuasion, for at least some sort of
covariance between a person&rsquo;s emotional states on the one hand
and what she thinks, opines, judges, perceives or imagines on the
other seems to be a precondition for the rhetorical method of steering
the audience&rsquo;s emotional state (see
 &sect;<a href="index-2.html#PersThroEmotHear">5.2</a>
 above). And this required covariance seems to be important at two
different stages of the formation of judgements. First, the hearer is
likely to change her emotional state in response to the different
contents she is currently cognizing. If e.g. someone takes it to be
the case or imagines that she is threatened by an imminent painful or
destructive evil, she is likely to feel fear, according to
Aristotle&rsquo;s definition. Second, the emotional condition the
hearer happens to be in is likely to have an impact on the judgement
she is going to pass. Being e.g. in an anxious or fearful condition,
the member of an assembly is likely to pass judgements that tend to be
less confident and to pay more attention to possible threats and
risks. The rhetorician tries to influence or enhance this latter
judgement of the hearers by referring them to objects or states of
affairs that are likely to alter their emotional conditions in a
predictable way, and this condition again is likely to have an impact
on the resulting judgement (see Fortenbaugh 1970 and 2002,
94&ndash;114 for seminal discussions of the role and nature of
emotions in Aristotelian rhetoric).</p>

<p>
Given the function of the rhetorical arousal of emotions (namely to
influence the formation of a judgement in the audience) and given the
only means available to a rhetorician for playing on the
audience&rsquo;s emotions (namely to draw the audience&rsquo;s attention
through the speech to e.g. a possibly terrifying object and thus to
make them think, opine or judge that there is, e.g. an imminent
painful or destructive evil), it is only natural that the
<em>Rhetoric</em> emphasizes the connection between emotions and
judgements. Put differently, it is first of all due to the
<em>Rhetoric&rsquo;s</em> peculiar interest in the rhetorical arousal
of emotions that it highlights the judgemental aspect of emotions.
Does this mean that Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Rhetoric</em> defends a
judgemental account of emotions? This is less clear and much more
controversial. It has led to the controversy between judgemental,
belief-based or &lsquo;doxastic&rsquo; accounts of emotions on the one
hand, and non-doxastic, non-judgemental, <em>phantasia</em>-based
accounts on the other (for a survey on this debate see Pearson 2014).
Is Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of emotions not only cognitive, but also
belief- or judgement-based or is it cognitive through the peculiar
contribution of the capacity of <em>phantasia</em>? One might doubt,
in the first place, whether the <em>Rhetoric</em>, due to its peculiar
nature and interest, is the right place to look for an elaborated
defence of any particular theory of emotion; however, it is legitimate
to inquire e.g. whether the recommended method of emotion arousal in
the <em>Rhetoric</em> presupposes either a belief- or a
<em>phantasia</em>-based account. In a similar vein, it is a
non-trivial decision for this kind of debate whether the
<em>Rhetoric</em>&rsquo;s vocabulary for mental or psychological
states, such as <em>krisis</em> (judgement) or <em>phantasia</em>
(imagination, appearance), should be taken to comply with the
technical vocabulary of the <em>De Anima</em> (see
 <a href="../aristotle-psychology/index.html">Aristotle: psychology</a>)
 and the ethical writings or not.</p>

<p>
The debate about judgemental and non-judgemental accounts of emotions
in Aristotle can be framed in various ways. One might e.g. debate
whether judgements/beliefs are necessary constituents of each and
every emotion or whether they are not necessary while
<em>phantasia</em> or the products of <em>phantasia</em>, i.e.
<em>phantasmata</em>, are necessary ingredients of emotions.
Alternatively, one can zoom in on the question whether the cognizing
or the representational state involved in emotions is either
judgement/belief or <em>phantasia</em>. On closer examination, the
attempt to decide this debate would involve other and, perhaps, deeper
questions that can hardly be answered by the evidence provided by the
<em>Rhetoric</em> alone, namely whether the various emotions treated
in Aristotle make up something like a unified natural class,
displaying a unified structure, or whether Aristotle&rsquo;s examples
of emotions are meant to be more like an open list, containing items
with varying structures (the latter option could better deal with the
fact that e.g. in the chapter on mildness Aristotle rather deals with
the calming of an emotion, namely anger, than with an episodic
emotion). Similarly, it makes a major difference whether one regards
emotions as one unified state or as complex states consisting of
different ingredients (e.g. pleasure/pain, sometimes judgement/belief,
sometimes appearance/imagination, episodes of desire: sometimes
related to particular courses of action, sometimes not, etc.).</p>

<p>
In a nutshell, the judgemental or belief-based camp is usually
exemplified by the positions of Nussbaum 1996 and Fortenbaugh 2002
(originally published in 1975). Fortenbaugh, in particular, draws on
the practice of arousing emotions in the <em>Rhetoric</em> and it is,
as already indicated, quite natural that Aristotle in this context
emphasizes what people think or believe (see also Rapp 2002, II 556f.
and Dow 2009), so it might be the rhetorical context that justifies a
preference for belief-based accounts. However, it has been objected
that even in the <em>Rhetoric</em> Aristotle defines particular
emotions with reference to <em>phantasia</em>, for example when he
defines fear as a kind of pain and excitement resulting from the
<em>phantasia</em> (appearance, imagination) of an imminent painful or
destructive evil. However, since <em>phantasia</em> is mentioned only
with regard to some types of emotions (putting the question of
technical and non-technical uses of the word aside), this can hardly
be meant as a defining characteristic of all kinds of emotions. For
this reason, defenders of the <em>phantasia</em>-based account claim
that formulations such as <em>phainesthai</em> (to seem, to appear) or
<em>phainomenon</em> (seeming, appearing) that Aristotle typically
uses when he refers to the objects of emotions (e.g. the seeming
insult, or what seems or appears to be an insult), belong to the
<em>phantasia</em>-language (see Moss 2012, 75&ndash;85) and thus
indicate that appearance in the technical sense is involved. It has
been objected though (see e.g. Fortenbaugh 2002, epilogue, and Dow
2009) that these formulations are compatible with the belief-based
account when they are taken to mean e.g. &lsquo;conspicuous
insult&rsquo; or &lsquo;what someone takes to be an insult&rsquo;,
thus highlighting that e.g. anger can be triggered by someone&rsquo;s
subjective belief that an insult took place, without it actually being
the case that there was such an insult. Another objection against
accounts that make judgements/beliefs necessary ingredients of
emotions comes from the phenomenon of animal emotions. Aristotle
himself is happy in his biological work to ascribe various emotions to
non-human animals, which would be inconsistent if we take
beliefs/judgements to involve rationality and if animals are thought
to lack this rationality (Sihvola 1996 e.g. criticizes
Nussbaum&rsquo;s judgemental account with reference to animal
emotions; see Sorabji 1993 on the psychological background of this
kind of debate). The same problem as in the case of animal emotions
occurs for human beings when their reason is either not yet developed
(as in the case of small children) or temporarily obstructed (as in
the case of drunken, sleepy or overly emotional adults). One might
therefore wonder whether even emotions of the same type, say fear, may
come about through different channels, as it were, depending on who
undergoes this emotion in what kind of situation &mdash; for example,
through the <em>phantasia</em> of an approaching enemy in one case and
through the well-considered judgement that an enemy is likely to
arrive soon in the other. In a similar vein, Pearson 2014, 209,
arrives at the conclusion that &ldquo;Aristotle thinks that a variety
of psychological states can grasp the cognitive content invloved in
emotions.&rdquo;</p>

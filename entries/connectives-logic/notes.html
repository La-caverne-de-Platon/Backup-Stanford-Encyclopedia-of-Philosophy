<p>
  <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a> Probably the best all-purpose
understanding of what logics are would take them as equivalence
classes of proof systems under the relation of having mutually
interderivable rules, though even this ignores issues about
translational equivalence across differing languages. For many
practical purposes it is sufficient to individuate logics more
coarsely, as consequence relations or generalized consequence
relations, or even, as is common in some areas, simply sets of
formulas.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 There has been much controversy as to how well this or that set of
rules governing implication or disjunction, for example, manages to
capture the (putatively) corresponding natural language
analogue&mdash;<em>if-then</em>, <em>or</em> (in the cases
cited)&mdash;but this entry will not be considering such
connective-specific issues.</p>
</div>

 Sometimes we will speak of # as truth-functional over a class of

the immediate linguistic context contains another occurrence of the
phrase &ldquo;with respect to&rdquo;.</p>

 We could make the same point apropos of the consequence relation,
&#8866;<sub>&or;</sub> say, determined by the class of all
&or;-Boolean valuations. (See the opening paragraph of Section

 Had the historical development of logic run differently and the
framework we would naturally call <span class="sc">Fmla</span>-<span class="sc">Set</span>
come to initial prominence, we would have been
fussing about the consistent valuations being closed under disjunctive
combinations, and the sequent-undefinability of the class of
&and;-Boolean valuations. As it is, we shall be hearing no more of +
and &sum;.</p>

 A somewhat similar range of properties is the focus of Williamson
(2006a), though with definitions that make the concepts in question
apply to arbitrary linguistic contexts and not just to connectives
(see
 <a href="index-2.html#Pre">Section 1</a>
 above), and without the explicit relativity to logics (consequence
relations or generalized consequence relations).</p>

Additional background on these matters is mentioned in the opening
paragraph of Section

 The fact that a generalized consequence relation is a binary relation
means that we need to distinguish symmetric and non-symmetric such
relations, as in general, and means that it is an unwise
terminological decision to call generalized consequence relations
<em>symmetric</em> consequence relations, as in Dunn and Hardegree
(2001), Chapter 6. There seems to be a confusion here between whether
a binary relation is <em>symmetric</em> and whether the treatment of
its two relata is <em>symmetrical</em>. Note, incidentally, that it is
binary relations that are symmetric, not binary operations
(connectives or otherwise), <em>pace</em> Restall (1999), p. 385, who
writes of a binary operation corresponding to a kind of conjunction
that it is &ldquo;idempotent, symmetric, and associative&rdquo;. The
word wanted is &lsquo;commutative&rsquo;. (Of course a connective
<em>qua</em> syntactic operation can never literally be commutative;
what is meant is that the corresponding
&lsquo;Lindenbaum-algebraic&rsquo; operation on synonymy-classes of
formulas is commutative.) Restall is in famous&mdash;if
muddled&mdash;company here; compare Quine (1951), describing
conjunction as transitive on one page (p. 18) and associative on the
next. The present point is not that one should never use terminology
appropriate to binary relations when speaking of
connectives&mdash;since there is, for instance, for any valuation
<em>v</em> the relation <em>R</em><sub><em>v</em></sub>, say, holding
between &phi; and &psi; just in case <em>v</em>(&phi; &and; &psi;) =
T, and for Boolean valuations at least, this relation is symmetric. It
is just that a clearer head is called for than Quine and
Restall&mdash;and many other writers&mdash;have displayed in jumbling
up the binary relational terminology (reflexive, symmetric,
transitive,&hellip;) with the binary operational terminology
(idempotent, commutative, associative, &hellip;). Among the
&lsquo;others&rsquo; are Dunn and Hardegree (again), who write on p.
215 of Dunn and Hardegree (2001) of the &ldquo;symmetry of
conjunction&rdquo;. For (pointers to) more on all this, see the opening paragraph of Section <a href="index-2.html#NotSou">5</a>. </p>

 Just as the sequents of <span class="sc">Set</span>-<span class="sc">Fmla</span>
can be thought of as those <span class="sc">Set</span>-<span class="sc">Set</span>
sequents &Gamma;
&#8827;&Delta; with &Delta; having exactly one element, those of <span class="sc">Fmla</span>
have the further feature that &Gamma; is empty,
making these sequents stand in a one-to-one correspondence with the
formulas of the language, with which for practical purposes we may
identify them, explaining the following words of the main text. There
are still two possibilities here, though. When the axiomatic or
&lsquo;Hilbert&rsquo; approach is taken, the rules are
formula-to-formula rules and the objects proved are formulas. On the
other hand, in our initial presentation of natural deduction, before
assumption discharging rules got into the act, the rules were again
presented as formula-to-formula rules, but with the things proved with
these rules were in effect <span class="sc">Set</span>-<span class="sc">Fmla</span>
sequents: meaning that the rules enabled us to
pass from a set of initial assumptions to a final formula. Should we
say that the logical framework here is <span class="sc">Set</span>-<span class="sc">Fmla</span>
on the basis of
what ends up being proved, or that it is <span class="sc">Fmla</span>,
on the basis of what the premisses and conclusions of the rules
involved are? Now that the distinction has been duly noted, there is
no urgent need to supply an answer to this question.</p>

 In fact for any rules <em>R</em> &cup; {&rho;}, &rho; is derivable
from <em>R</em> together with these structural rules if and only if
<em>Glo</em>(<em>R</em>) &sube; <em>Glo</em>(&rho;).</p>

 In fact, Garson works with a variation on the framework <span class="sc">Set</span>-<span class="sc">Fmla</span>
which allows
sequents &Gamma; &#8827; &phi; with &Gamma; infinite, and this feature
is essential to his proof of the claim here reported. Whether it is
essential for the correctness of the claim, I do not know.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Dummett (1991) provides an extended discussion of such positions.
There is an interesting proposal in Peacocke (1987) for &ldquo;reading
off&rdquo; (Boolean) valuational semantics from inference rules found
&lsquo;primitively compelling&rsquo; by reasoners (as a necessary
condition for their possessing the concepts expressed by <em>and</em>,
<em>or</em>, etc.), which for some cases may be introduction rules and
others elimination rules. This attractive suggestion has unfortunately
come in for worrying criticism more recently: for example in
Williamson (2006b), (2013). It may be necessary to retreat from a
claim about <em>possession</em> of the concepts concerned, to a claim
about something like <em>mastery</em> of those concepts, with the
attendant obligation to spell out what the latter consists in, in a
way that does not make the claim vacuous.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Thus the consequence relation associated with the present natural
deduction system is trivial&mdash;&ldquo;almost inconsistent&rdquo;,
as it sometimes put&mdash;in the sense introduced apropos of
Rautenberg&rsquo;s maximality theorem in
 <a href="index-2.html#SeqVal">Section 2</a>.
 (For a proper formulation of the natural deduction rules here the
above formula-to-formula rules should be explicitly represented as
sequent-to-sequent rules with a set parameter, &ldquo;&Gamma;&rdquo;
sitting on the left of a &ldquo;&#8827;&rdquo;.) The provable sequents
&phi; &#8827; &phi; <span class="sc">Tonk</span> &psi; and &phi; <span class="sc">Tonk</span>
&psi; &#8827; &psi; represent conditions on
this consequence relation induced by the determinants <span class="nw">&lang;T,
<em>x</em>, T&rang;</span> for <em>x</em> = T, F,
in the former case and &lang;<em>y</em>, F, F&rang; for <em>y</em> =
T, F, in the latter. Thus any valuation consistent with this
consequence relation must respect each of two opposite
determinants&mdash;making <span class="sc">Tonk</span>
overdetermined&mdash;&lang;T, F, T&rang;, taking <em>x</em> = F and
&lang;T, F, F&rang; taking <em>y</em> = T. The only valuations that
respect both these determinants are <em>v</em><sub>T</sub>, assigning
T to every formula, and <em>v</em><sub>F</sub> assigning F to every
formula, and the logic determined by
{<em>v</em><sub>T</sub>,<em>v</em><sub>F</sub>} is the smallest
trivial consequence relation on the language concerned. This is our
semantic gloss on the <span class="sc">Tonk</span> example. It would
be quite wrong to diagnose the problem in terms of the non-existence
of a <em>truth-function</em> corresponding to <span class="sc">Tonk</span>,
or to say, as Stevenson (1961), p. 127, does,
that the problem is that Prior &ldquo;gives the meanings of
connectives in terms of permissive rules, whereas they should be
stated in terms of truth-function statements in a metalanguage.&rdquo;
(Prior 1976 replies to Stevenson, and <em>inter alia</em> suggests
that the consequence relation just described can be thought of as
&ldquo;one-valued logic&rdquo;&mdash;<em>cf.</em> Hamblin 1967; the
better term would be <em>constant-valued</em> logic.) There is nothing
incoherent about non-truth-functional&mdash;or more accurately, not
fully determined&mdash;connectives: the problem arises from being
overdetermined. The same objection, as Read (1988), p. 168, observes,
appears to apply to the remark in Peacocke (1987) that the
&ldquo;semantical objection to <em>tonk</em> is that there is no
binary function on truth values which validates both its introduction
and its elimination rules&rdquo;, though there is more room for
manoeuvre here: the implicit suggestion is that coherence requires
soundness, not soundness and completeness, under some truth-functional
interpretation. This amounts to deeming unintelligible any connective
which is &lsquo;strongly contra-classical&rsquo;,
in the sense of not being thus interpretable. But what does soundness
under &lsquo;some truth-functional interpretation&rsquo; mean? It will
not do to say: soundness with respect to some <em>V</em> over which
the connective in question is truth-functional, since the there may
not be enough variety in the truth-values supplied by <em>V</em> to
the formulas of the language, in which case its elements may respect
the determinants for a truth-function only vacuously because some
possibilities do not arise. (For an extreme case, consider <em>V</em>
= &empty;.) One natural thing to require is that all combinatorially
possible truth-value assignments to the propositional variables are
provided, i.e., that &forall;<em>X</em> &sube; &#8469;
&exist;<em>v</em> &isin; <em>V</em> &forall;<em>k</em> &isin; &#8469;
[<em>v</em>(<em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>) = T] iff <em>k</em>
&isin; <em>X</em>. Note that this makes <em>V</em> uncountable. For
most purposes, including the present one, a much weaker condition
suffices, namely that <em>V</em> should be <em>non-constant</em> in
the sense that <em>V</em> contains some valuation distinct from
<em>v</em><sub>T</sub> and <em>v</em><sub>F</sub>.</p>

 Of necessity, some examples in this paragraph have been mentioned
without the explanation that would accompany them in a fuller
treatment of this material. There is also a philosophical complication
ignored in the use, above and below, of such phrases as
&lsquo;adherent of intuitionistic logic&rsquo;, in that they seem at
least to presume the incorrectness of a position that has been called
logical pluralism and defended under that name in Beall and Restall
(2006).</p>

 Here we see that the empty succedent is something of a luxury in
intuitionistic logic, rather than a necessity, since we could always
use <em>F</em> to fill it&mdash;or rather, &perp;, as one would say,

 Notice that with &ldquo;&phi; <span class="sc">Tonk</span>
&psi;&rdquo; replaced by &ldquo;&phi;, &psi;&rdquo; the inset sequents
are available by (Id) and (Weakening) on the left and right. Since the
comma here is not a connective, however, there is no formula&mdash;in
the absence of <span class="sc">Tonk</span>&mdash;which could serve as
a cut formula on the basis of these two sequent premisses. On one
usage of the term &lsquo;connective&rsquo;, that associated with
Belnap&rsquo;s Display Logic (see Restall (2000), Chapter 6) something
corresponding to the comma and many more somewhat analogous devices
are sometimes referred to as &lsquo;structure connectives&rsquo; (as

 This idea is essentially that of Setlur (1970), where a variation on
the theme of Helena Rasiowa&rsquo;s, of taking hybrids in the
framework <span class="sc">Fmla</span>&mdash;holding fixed the
remaining connectives&mdash;is to be found. The device of taking
direct products of matrix tables which works in <span class="sc">Fmla</span>
does not fare so well in the richer frameworks;
some remarks on the comparison with <span class="sc">Set</span>-<span class="sc">Fmla</span>

In an earlier publication, not listed in the

&lsquo;hybrids&rsquo; for the greatest lower bounds with respect to
the subconnective relation, oblivious to the confusion this might
engender. It did at least have one advantage, not shared by
&lsquo;hybrids&rsquo;, of calling readily to mind a word&mdash;namely

 The idea that we could use a rule of &#9744; introduction or
insertion on the right with a proviso to the effect that formulas on
the left be &lsquo;fully modalized&rsquo;, and use this in the
reduplicated system to argue that since <span class="nw">&#9744;&phi;
&#8827; &phi;</span> is provable, the duplicated version of this rule
allows the transition to <span class="nw">&#9744;&phi; &#8827;
&#9744;&prime;&phi;,</span> on the grounds that the formula on the
left is &lsquo;fully modalized&rsquo;, involves an illicitly equivocal
use of the latter phrase. Something close to a model-theoretic version
of this mistake would be involved in the suggestion that since
<b>S5</b> is determined by the class of models in which the
accessibility relation is universal, and there is only one universal
relation on any given set, &#9744; is uniquely characterized by this
logic. The mistake here is to think that because we can simplify the
completeness result for <b>S5</b> from equivalence-relational models
to universal models, the same applies to the bimodal
&ldquo;reduplicated <b>S5</b>&rdquo; logic that is at issue for the
unique characterization claim. (&ldquo;Something close&rdquo;, because
the syntactical argument would also apply in the case of <b>S4</b>
too, where nothing like the fallacy in this model-theoretic reasoning
is likely to seem tempting.)</p>

 There is a natural notion of conservative extension which applies
directly to (pairs of) consequence relations, but to avoid going into
that here, we have adopted a formulation in terms of conservative
extension as a relation between proof systems. Such a formulation would not be ideal here anyway because
the fact that the initial consequence relation is &or;-classical does
not imply that the extended consequence relation is, by contrast with
the situation in <span class="sc">Set</span>-<span class="sc">Set</span>,

  This point is explained on p.&nbsp;23
of Davies and Humberstone (1980), where relevant work by Dummett is
cited &ndash; not that precisely this terminology is used there to
make the
 point. Further references to Dummett on this topic, and discussion of his
preferred approach to it via matrix methodology, can be found in
&sect;4 of Humberstone (1998). The connection with the present
semantic setting is provided by thinking of frames with distinguished
points (one per frame), underlying the models considered in the first
paragraph, above, and recalling that any such frame gives rise to a
matrix whose elements are sets of points from the frame. One takes the
set of all such points as the sole designated element to capture the
general validity of formulas (to have validity in the matrix
correspond to validity on the frame), and takes all of sets of points
containing the distinguished point as the designated elements in order
to capture the real-world (or diagonal) validity of formulas. For the
validity of sequents (or the characterization of consequence
relations) in the general and real-world styles a more roundabout
description &ndash; not given here &ndash; is called for, since in
either case it is the local rather than global consequence relations
that we are concerned with here.</p>

 Fusco (2019), p. 17, writes, concerning the favoured interpretation
of &phi;&nbsp;<span class="sc">or</span>&nbsp;&psi; as (1)/(2),
&ldquo;This semantic value for disjunctions comes from the classic
literature on disjunctive questions (Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1982;
Lewis, 1982).&rdquo; The gloss here is fine if &ldquo;comes
from&rdquo; means &ldquo;is inspired by, &rdquo; though not if it
means &ldquo;coincides with that to be found in&rdquo;. The details in
all three cases differ, as we can illustrate by comparing, below, the
semantic values they assign (relative to any model) to what we shall
write as <em>p</em>&nbsp;<span class="sc">or</span>&nbsp;<em>q</em> in
all three cases. The semantic value of a formula/sentence &phi; we
take as a propositional concept in the sense of Stalnaker 1978: a
function mapping worlds to propositions (&nbsp;=&nbsp;sets of worlds),
whose argument is the reference world/world-taken-as-actual and whose
value is the set of worlds (of evaluation&rsquo; at which &phi; is
true relative to that reference world (in the model in question).
Since all we need to know about the reference world for this purpose
in the case in which &phi; is constructed from sentence letters
<em>p</em>, <em>q</em> (as here, since the &phi; of current interest
is <em>p</em>&nbsp;<span class="sc">or</span>&nbsp;<em>q</em>).
Fusco&rsquo;s <span class="sc">or</span> notation is used for all
three cases, the third being that described in Fusco (2015) (as well
as in the Stalnaker-style matrix in Figure 8 in Fusco 2019, which
coincides with Figure 3 of Fusco 2015), and &par;&phi;&par; is the set
of worlds at which the Boolean formula &phi; is true. </p>

Lewis&rsquo;s <em>p</em>&nbsp;<span class="sc">or</span>&nbsp;<em>q</em>:
<em>p</em> &and; <em>q</em>

&not;<em>q</em> &mapsto; &par;<em>p</em>&par;; &not;<em>p</em> &and;

<em>p</em> &and; <em>q</em>
&mapsto; &par;<em>p</em> &or; <em>q</em>&par;; <em>p</em> &and;
&not;<em>q</em> &mapsto; &par;<em>p</em>&par;; &not;<em>p</em> &and;
<em>q</em> &mapsto; &par;<em>q</em>&par;; &not;<em>p</em> &and;
&not;<em>q</em> &mapsto; &par;<em>p</em> &or; <em>q</em>&par;.</p> The
Groenendijk&ndash;Stokhof characterization of the propositional
concept in question is based on lines 5&ndash;7 of p.&nbsp;180 of
Groenendijk and Stokhof (1982). The first case listed under
Lewis&rsquo;s name here is a &lsquo;don&rsquo;t care&rsquo; case for
him:

<blockquote>
What happens if (&hellip;) more than one of the presented alternatives are
true? Then I think a presupposition required for the proper use of the
&lsquo;whether&rsquo;-clause has failed, with the result that no
clear-cut data on truth-conditions are available and so we may as well
handle the case in the most technically convenient way.
</blockquote>

<p>
Perhaps the same should be said of the case in which neither
alternative is true (or no alternative it, as Lewis would put it,
since he thinks of the <em>whether</em>/<em>or</em> construction as
involving a multigrade &ndash; rather than a binary &ndash;
connective).</p>

<p>
To obtain, from the specification of the propositional concepts as
above, a Boolean&nbsp;+&nbsp;<em>A</em>(ctually) representation having
a given such function as its semantic value &ndash; thereby spelling
out the understanding of <em>p</em>&nbsp;<span class="sc">or</span>&nbsp;<em>q</em>
for the case in question, replace
the &ldquo;maps to&rdquo; arrow with with an implicational arrow, for
each of the four state-descriptions
&psi;<sub>1</sub>,&hellip;,&psi;<sub>4</sub>, putting the antecedent of the
implication thus formed into the scope of &ldquo;<em>A</em>&rdquo; and
dropping the &ldquo;&par;&rdquo;s to obtain its consequent
&chi;<sub><em>i</em></sub> (<em>i</em> = 1,&hellip;,4). Thus
&ldquo;&psi;<sub><em>i</em></sub>&nbsp;&mapsto;&par;&chi;<sub><em>i</em></sub>&par;&rdquo;
becomes
&ldquo;<em>A</em>&psi;<sub><em>i</em></sub>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;&chi;<sub><em>i</em></sub>&rdquo;.
One then conjoins the four cases to give the desired representation.
Alternatively, since the antecedents
<em>A</em>&psi;<sub><em>i</em></sub> in a given case are mutually
exclusive and jointly exhaustive, we can replace the implications with
conjunctions and the conjunctions with disjunctions to obtain an
unrestrictedly equivalent representation. This is essentially the
relation between (1) and (2) in the main text (replacing the schematic
letters with sentence letters), except that in (1) Fusco has
simplified the representation by collapsing the
<em>p</em>&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;<em>q</em> and
&not;<em>p</em>&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;&not;<em>q</em> cases into a single
<em>p</em>&nbsp;&harr;&nbsp;<em>q</em> case, since the conditionals
with these <em>A</em>-prefixed antecedents have the same consequent
(namely <em>p</em>&nbsp;&or;&nbsp;<em>q</em>), with (2) following suit
in this regard.</p>

<p>
The use of the &ldquo;<span class="sc">or</span>&rdquo;-notation in
the three cases above should not be taken to suggest that Lewis and
Groenendijk&ndash;Stokhof were following Fusco&rsquo;s general
strategy, of tailoring the received wisdom as to how disjunction works
across the board (namely as &or;) so as to give a single all-purpose
account working equally well for its bread-and-butter occurrences as
for certain problematically embedded occurrences, namely the
deontically embedded occurrences. It is not as though the main aim of
Lewis and Groenendijk&ndash;Stokhof had been to provide a similarly
uniform account, except with a different range of problematic cases,
namely the indirect question embeddings. Rather, their aim was simply
to provide <em>some satisfactory compositional</em> account of the
problematic constructions. (On this they make different proposals,
even restricting attention to the case in which exactly one of the
alternatives posed by an alternative question obtains &ndash;
<em>p</em>, say, out of {<em>p</em>,&nbsp;<em>q</em>}. To know, in
this case, whether <em>p</em> or <em>q</em>, understood
&lsquo;alternatively&lsquo; &ndash; rising-then-falling intonation, as
opposed to knowing whether or not it is the case that <em>p</em> or
<em>q</em> &ndash; Lewis requires the subject simply to know that
<em>p</em>, whereas Groenendijk and Stokhof require the subject to
know that <em>p</em> and also that not-<em>q</em>, and quite
generally, for them knowing whether this is the case or that is the
case is a matter of knowing whether this is the case <em>and</em>
knowing whether that is the case, with alternative questions thus
reduced to multiple polar questions.) In a final section, Lewis (1982)
toys (not very enthusiastically) with a treatment of &ldquo;whether
&phi; or &psi;&rdquo; as
<em>wheth</em>&nbsp;&phi;&nbsp;&or;&nbsp;<em>wheth</em>&nbsp;&psi;,
where <em>wheth</em>&nbsp;&phi; is interpreted as
<em>A</em>&phi;&nbsp;&and;&nbsp;&dagger;&phi;. Here &dagger; is an
operator that reduplicates the world of evaluation as the reference
world in the same way that <em>A</em> reduplicates the reference world
as the world of evaluation, found in Stalnaker 1978, Davies and
Humberstone 1980 (note 16), Fusco 2019, as well as in work by Lewis
not in our bibliography, and elsewhere. This &ldquo;&dagger;&rdquo;
has no effect on purely Boolean formulas, which is why were able to
state (3) in the main text without including it (given the restriction
on &phi;, &psi; there). Also, the contemporary descendant of the
approach in Groenendijk and Stokhof (1982), namely inquisitive
semantics &ndash; see &sect;7.1 of Aloni (2016) and &sect;2 of Cross
and Roelofsen (2018) for more detail and further references &ndash;
manages considerable advances in unifying various expressions across
what might have been thought to be radically discontinuous uses across
declarative and interrogative contexts, though as an incidental
by-product in what may seem like the opposite direction, it makes
available at least three different disjunction-like connectives each
taken as the main form of disjunction in some piece of work in the
<em>genre</em>: see &sect;6 in Humberstone 2019 for a comparative
discussion of them, as well as &sect;7 there for further
(one-dimensional) aspects of the logic and semantics of
<em>whether</em>, with some examples of missteps in this area given in

 Footnote 36 in Fusco (2015) is potentially confusing on this score.
How best to reformulate it for Fusco&rsquo;s purposes is not a
question that we can to go into here, because of the multiplicity of
consequence relations involved. Although the present selective
presentation of ideas from Fusco (2015) has focused on two such
relations &ndash; general consequence and diagonal consequence &ndash;

 This is not to say there are no difficulties in the vicinity. In
particular, expressed with a casual informality here, the following
difficulty arises. If it is supposed to be <em>a priori</em> knowable
that <em>Ap</em>&nbsp;&harr;&nbsp;<em>p</em> &ndash; for example, that
there are actually pandas in Lhasa if and only if there are pandas in
Lhasa, then how can
<em>K</em>(<em>Ap</em>&nbsp;&harr;&nbsp;<em>p</em>) represent knowing
whether <em>p</em>? We presumably cannot know <em>a priori</em>
whether or not there are pandas in Lhasa. This problem is noted, and a
solution suggested, in Rabinowicz and Segerberg (1994). (These
authors, incidentally, use the terms <em>strong</em> and <em>weak</em>
validity for general and real-word/diagonal validity. A fuller listing
of the terminologies employed for this distinction by different people
is given in note 177 of Humberstone 2016, p.&nbsp;219, with additional
background in note 45 on p.&nbsp;60 of the same work.)</p>

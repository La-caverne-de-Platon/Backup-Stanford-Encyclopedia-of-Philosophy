<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Pascal&rsquo;s Wager</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>  H&aacute;jek 2012
argues that in fact this is too quick. This article considers a series of
increasingly strong senses of &ldquo;superdominance&rdquo; (the one
considered here is &ldquo;superdominance+&rdquo;), and he argues
that none of them is strong enough to confer such a requirement. This,
in turn, casts doubt on the validity of the first of Pascal&rsquo;s wagers.
However, the details get somewhat intricate, and I have chosen not to
get into them in this exposition.</p></div>

 Unfortunately,
he squanders this insight when he lapses back to the assumption that
the probability is 1/2 shortly thereafter: &ldquo;And so our proposition is
of infinite force, when there is the finite to stake in a game where
there are equal risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to
gain.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a> 
Consider a gamble that pays you \(W\) units (for &lsquo;win&rsquo;) if
\(X\), and nothing otherwise. We are seeking the fair price \(f\), at
which you should be indifferent between playing the gamble and not;
you should be prepared to pay that much, but no more. Expected utility
theory tells us that <em>the fair price is the gamble&rsquo;s expected utility</em>:
</p>

\[
f = P(X)W   
\]    

<p>where \(P(X)\) is the chance of gain (and so \(1 - P(X)\) is the
chance of loss).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s derive this from Pascal&rsquo;s answer, quoted here again:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip; the uncertainty of the gain is proportioned to the certainty
of the stake according to the proportion of the chances of gain and
loss &hellip;
</blockquote>

<p>
You will pay \(f\) with certainty: this is &ldquo;the certainty of the
stake&rdquo;. It is uncertain whether you win, but if you do your gain
is \(W - f\): this is &ldquo;the uncertainty of the gain&rdquo;. This is
proportioned to the certainty of the stake, \(f\)&mdash;that is,</p>

\[
\frac{f}{W-f}
\]

<p>according to</p>

\[
\frac{P(X)}{1 - P(X)}
\]

<p>That is,</p>

\[
\frac{f}{W-f} = \frac{P(X)}{1 - P(X)}
\]

<p>Simple algebra gives</p>

\[
f - fP(X) = P(X)W - fP(X)
\]

<p>and hence</p>

\[
f = P(X)W
\]

<p><em>The fair price is the gamble&rsquo;s expected utility</em>!</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 In the basic
version of decision theory that we have presented, states are assumed
to be independent of actions. Evidential decision theory generalizes
this. It replaces in its expectation calculation for a given action the
unconditional probabilities of states by the conditional probabilities
of the states, given the action&mdash;see Jeffrey 1983. Now perhaps
what you do is not independent of whether God exists. For instance,
maybe God helps people wager for Him, so that</p>

\[
{\scriptsize P(\text{God exists} \mid \text{you wager for God}) \gt P(\text{God exists} \mid \text{you wager against God}).}
\]

<p>
Still, the expected utility calculations are as before, provided the
first conditional probability is positive and finite: infinite for
wagering for God, finite for wagering against God.</p>

<p>

Causal decision theory replaces evidential decision theory&rsquo;s
conditional probabilities with probabilities that capture the degree of
causal relevance of an action to each state. There are various versions
of causal decision theory&mdash;see Lewis 1981. Using some such
version would presumably not significantly affect matters here. We
would just replace the assumption that your probability is positive and
finite with the same assumption about whatever probability is used
instead.</p></div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 After all,
infinite utilities run afoul of the Archimedean, or continuity axiom
that is commonly assumed in decision theory:</p>

<blockquote>If you prefer \(A\) to \(B\), and
prefer \(B\) to \(C\), then there is a gamble between \(A\) and
\(C\) (\(A\) with probability \(p\), \(C\) with
probability \(1 - p\), for some real-valued \(p\)) that you
regard as equally desirable as \(B\) for sure.</blockquote>

<p>

For suppose that salvation, say, has infinite utility for you. You
prefer salvation to $1, and prefer $1 to nothing; but there is no such
gamble that rewards you with salvation if you win, and nothing if you
lose, that you value at $1. Indeed, assuming that the probability of
winning remains positive, you prefer the gamble to any finite reward;
but if the probability of winning drops to 0, your preference
discontinuously switches to the finite reward. The objection, then, is
that infinite utilities run afoul of the underpinnings of decision
theory (by violating a preference axiom), and thus of the theory itself. Yet
that theory is appealed to in Premise 3 of the argument. In short,
Premise 1 is in tension with Premise 3.</p>

<p>

The issue then becomes whether continuity is a requirement on
rational preference. H&aacute;jek 1997 argues that it is not, and
gives further positive arguments for allowing infinite utilities into
decision theory. Sorensen 1994 likewise argues for &ldquo;infinite decision
theory&rdquo;. For a highly technical presentation of
&lsquo;non-Archimedean&rsquo; decision theory, see Skalia 1975. For
related work on infinite utilities that is more philosophical, see Cain
1995, Nelson 1991, Ng 1995, Vallentyne 1993, Vallentyne 1995,
Vallentyne and Kagan 1997, and van Liedekerke 1995. Some of the
literature on the so-called two-envelope problem is also 
relevant&mdash;see, for example, Broome 1995, Castell and Batens 1994,
Chalmers 1997, Jackson et al. 1994, Nalebuff 1989.</p></div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>  It should be pointed out
that the rival Gods must award infinite utility for salvation in order
to create a problem&mdash;otherwise they will be trumped by the ones
that do. (It seems that Kali and Odin thus drop out of consideration,
for example.) And to be damaging to the Wager, the alternative
hypotheses about how salvation is achieved should be mutually
exclusive. If there is some common core to the theistic hypotheses,
and it suffices to (strive to) believe that in order to be saved, then
there is no problem. For instance, it will not matter that you do not
know what God&rsquo;s favorite real number is, if it turns out that you are
saved as long as your belief is adequate in other respects. So it is
crucial that salvation hinges on getting the details of the belief
right. What, then, should we believe? To settle this question, it
seems we get nowhere with Pascal-style practical reasoning.</p>

<p>

One response is that we are therefore in a position somewhat like that
of Buridan&rsquo;s ass, unable to settle which course of action is best; and
that like the ass we are better off doing something rather than
nothing, and in this case that means choosing one of the theistic
hypotheses, and hoping we choose the right one. So it might still be
rationally required to be a theist. See Jordan 1994a for a version of
this &ldquo;ecumenical&rdquo; response. There are at least two
counter-responses.  Firstly, the assumption that there are
alternative <em>Gods</em> who offer infinite rewards really plays no
role in the many-Gods objection. All that matters is that there are
sources of infinite reward besides Pascal&rsquo;s God. These sources could
even be inanimate&mdash;as it might be, supreme pleasure machines,
which offer infinite utility irrespective of one&rsquo;s beliefs. Secondly,
one of the alternative Gods might punish those who wager for him, and
reward those who don&rsquo;t&mdash;see Martin&rsquo;s 1983 &ldquo;perverse
master&rdquo;.</p></div>

<div id="note-9">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a> Here are the
third and fourth problems for Premise 2.</p>

<p>

<u>3. Infinitesimal probability for God&rsquo;s existence.</u></p>

<p>

One might reply that you can rationally assign infinitesimal
probability to God&rsquo;s existence&mdash;see e.g. Oppy 1990. The argument
might run, for example, that there are infinitely many possible Gods to
consider (see our discussion of the many Gods objection), and for some
infinite subset of them that includes Pascal&rsquo;s God, rationality does
not favor any one over the rest. Treating them even-handedly then
requires assigning infinitesimal probability to each. Or again, a
Bayesian might say that you could coherently assign to God&rsquo;s existence
an infinitesimal probability, provided that you also assign a
probability to God&rsquo;s non-existence that falls short of 1 by the same
infinitesimal.</p>

<p>

It is remarkable that Pascal anticipated the notion of infinitesimal
probability, when he says: &ldquo;if there were an infinity of chances, of
which one only would be for you, you would still be right in wagering
one [life] &hellip; if there were an infinity of an infinitely happy life to
gain.&rdquo; But what he says here is far from obvious. If \(\infty\) is a
legitimate utility value, then offhand it would seem that \(1/\infty\) is
a legitimate probability value, and indeed it seems to be the very one
that he is considering. However, then we have:</p>

\[ 
\mathrm{E}(\text{wager for God}) = \infty \times \frac{1}{\infty} +
f_1 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{\infty}\right) \approx 1
+ f_1
\]

<p>

And it is not clear that this should exceed \(f_3\).</p>

<p>

All of this treats \(\infty\) as if it is a number, subject to
ordinary arithmetic operations, such as taking reciprocals,
multiplying and adding. Perhaps, for example, \(\infty \times
(1/\infty)\) is not defined, much as \(\infty - \infty\) is
not. But that is just another way in which a probability of
\((1/\infty)\) might thwart Pascal&rsquo;s reasoning. We will say more below
about infinite numbers for which such arithmetic operations are
unproblematic.</p>

<p>

<u>4. Imprecise (vague) probability for God&rsquo;s existence</u></p>

<p>

So far we have presupposed that probability assignments are sharp.
However, Pascal&rsquo;s argument is addressed to us&mdash;mere humans. And
it is apparently a fact about us that our belief states are
irremediably imprecise: we cannot assign probability, precise to
indefinitely many decimal places, to all propositions. (Such
imprecision about probabilities is also called
&ldquo;vagueness&rdquo;.) Or perhaps even ideally rational agents may,
or indeed should, assign imprecise probabilities when their relevant
evidence is impoverished, as Pascal thinks that it is here. (See Joyce
2005 for more on this route to imprecise probabilities in general.)
Perhaps, then, rationality permits us to assign imprecise probability
to God&rsquo;s existence.  If it moreover permits us to assign it
probability that is imprecise over an interval that includes 0, then
the Wager fails&mdash;see H&aacute;jek 2000. Indeed, Pascal&rsquo;s claim
that &ldquo;[reason] can decide nothing here&rdquo; might be thought
to support a probability assignment to God&rsquo;s existence that is
imprecise over the entire \([0, 1]\) interval.</p></div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a> One could also
insist that rational choices must be ratifiable (&agrave; la Jeffrey
1983 or Sobel 1996), and that the act of maximum expectation might not
be.</p>

<p>

A common rationale for maximizing expectation comes from the
various laws of large numbers. Their content is roughly that under
suitable circumstances, in the limit, one&rsquo;s average reward tends to the
expectation; and of course one wants to maximize one&rsquo;s average reward.
But the strong law of large numbers assumes that the expectation is
finite, and since the expectation of wagering for God is putatively
infinite, it clearly cannot be appealed to here. (See e.g. Feller 1971,
236.) Perhaps an appeal to the weak law of large numbers, which allows
infinite expectation, would suffice. But being a limit theorem, it
concerns infinitely long runs of trials. Far from having such a long
run here, we have just a single-shot decision problem. This is a
decision that you do not get to repeat. This is not so troubling,
perhaps, when the variance (a measure of the spread of the distribution
of outcomes) is small, so that getting an outcome close to the
expectation is probable; but what about when the variance is large?</p>

<p>

This brings us to yet another problem for Pascal&rsquo;s third premise. To
be sure, the expectation of wagering for God is infinite, if we accept
Pascal&rsquo;s earlier assumptions; but so too is the variance. Expectation
does not seem to be such a good guide to choiceworthiness when the
variance is large&mdash;for what one might end up getting can then
be much worse than the expectation&mdash;let alone when the variance
is infinite. (See Weirich 1984 and Sorensen 1994 for versions of this
last point.) Indeed, the lower one makes \(f_2\) (or more generally,
some highly dispreferred outcome), the less compelling premise 3
seems; and the lower one makes the probability of salvation (or more
generally, of some highly desired outcome), the less compelling
premise 3 seems. Yet consistent with premise 1, \(f_2\) could be
(almost) as low as one likes, and consistent with premise 2, the
probability of salvation could be (almost) as low as one likes.</p></div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>  
Recall Schlesinger&rsquo;s (1994, 90) tie-breaking principle: &ldquo;In
cases where the mathematical expectations are infinite, the criterion
for choosing the outcome to bet on is its
probability&rdquo;. Similarly, Golding (1994, 139&ndash;140) offers
this principle: &ldquo;given a decision problem where an infinite
value is at stake, the option that offers the highest probability of
attaining the infinite value is the rational choice, regardless of
what other probabilities or finite values are at stake&rdquo;. This
clearly rules out the coin-tossing strategy, the die-tossing strategy,
and all the other mixed strategies, since these have lower
probabilities of your achieving salvation than outright wagering for
God does. Sorensen 1994 objects to Schlesinger&rsquo;s principle as being ad
hoc. One way of putting the objection is that the principle lacks the
foundational support that maximizing expected utility has. Bartha 2007
provides it such support. Be that as it may, Pascal does not appeal to
the principle in his argument. As it stands, the argument is
apparently invalid.</p>

<p>

The problem is that multiplying &infin; by any positive, finite
probability again yields &infin;. Let us call this property of &infin;
<em>reflexivity under multiplication</em> (by such a probability). Such
reflexivity is at once the strength of the Wager (for then Pascal does
not need to say anything more about your probability of God&rsquo;s
existence), and its weakness (for then all the various mixed strategies
get maximal expectation also). One could try to fix the weakness, while
saving as much one can of the strength. This would involve finding a
utility for salvation that is not reflexive under multiplication, yet
which is still sufficiently large to swamp your probability, whatever
it is, in the expectation calculation.</p>

<p>

For instance, if the utility of salvation were enormous, but finite (as it is on Golding&rsquo;s reading of the Wager, 1994, 130&ndash;131),
then the mixed strategies would yield lower expectation than outright
wagering for God (multiplying that utility by 1/2, 1/6, etc. makes a
difference). And the utility could be made enormous enough to offset
any actual person&rsquo;s probability assignment, however small (provided it
is positive and finite), so that the expectation of outright belief is
maximal for everybody. Or suppose that the utility of salvation were an
infinite number that is not reflexive under multiplication. Consider,
for example, the infinite numbers of non-standard analysis (see
Robinson 1966, Nelson 1987), or the surreal infinite numbers of Conway
1976. Multiplication of such a utility by a positive, finite
probability (less than 1) yields another, smaller infinite number. So
the expectation of wagering for God again exceeds that of wagering
against God, whatever your probability is (provided it is positive and
finite), and also that of each mixed strategy. See H&aacute;jek 2004 for various devices along these lines.</p>

<p>

These proposals appear to yield valid arguments for wagering for God,
where Pascal&rsquo;s argument was invalid. The trouble is that they do not
seem adequately to capture Pascal&rsquo;s reasoning. He writes: &ldquo;Unity
added to infinity adds nothing to it&rdquo;. Let us call this property
of infinity <em>reflexivity under addition</em>. We can see why Pascal
would want the utility of salvation to be reflexive under addition:
salvation is supposed to be the best possible thing. But if that
utility is finite, or non-standard infinite, or surreal infinite, then
adding one to it does make a difference. What is wanted, then, is the
seemingly impossible: a representation of the reward of salvation that
is reflexive under addition (so that it cannot be bettered), but not
reflexive under multiplication by positive, finite probabilities (so
that the mixed strategies can be distinguished in expectation from
outright belief). See H&aacute;jek 2012 for further reformulations
of Pascal&rsquo;s Wager that appear to be valid; moreover, one of them
capture&rsquo;s Pascal&rsquo;s idea of salvation being the best thing possible,
with the utility of salvation being &infin;, while the utility of
damnation is &minus;&infin; (the way that some authors understand the
Wager in the first place). See also Herzberg 2011 for a valid reformulation of Pascal&rsquo;s Wager with hyperreal utilities.</p>

<p>

Another approach, more faithful to Pascal&rsquo;s theology, eschews
premise 1&rsquo;s numerical utilities altogether, opting instead
for <em>comparative</em> judgments of value, and making suitable
adjustments elsewhere in the argument. For example, Rota 2016 offers a
reformulation that replaces premise 1&rsquo;s values of \(\infty\),
\(f_1\), \(f_2\), \(f_3\), with O1, O2, O3, O4, respectively, where O1
is much greater than O3, and O2 is either greater than, equal to, or
only a small amount less than O4. Premise 2&rsquo;s quantification
over all positive probabilities is replaced by one over probabilities
of \(1/2\) or higher. The conclusion essentially is that practical
rationality requires agents with such probabilities to wager for God
(slightly changing Rota&rsquo;s wording to conform with ours).</p>

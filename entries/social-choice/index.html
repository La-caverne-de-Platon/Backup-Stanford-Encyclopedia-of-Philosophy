<h1>Social Choice Theory</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Dec 18, 2013</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

Social choice theory is the study of collective decision processes and procedures.
It is not a single theory, but a cluster of models and results
concerning the aggregation of individual inputs (e.g., votes,
preferences, judgments, welfare) into collective outputs (e.g.,
collective decisions, preferences, judgments, welfare). Central
questions are: How can a group of individuals choose a winning outcome
(e.g., policy, electoral candidate) from a given set of options? What
are the properties of different voting systems? When is a voting system
democratic? How can a collective (e.g., electorate, legislature,
collegial court, expert panel, or committee) arrive at coherent
collective preferences or judgments on some issues, on the basis of its
members' individual preferences or judgments? How can we rank
different social alternatives in an order of social welfare? Social choice
theorists study these questions not just by looking at examples, but 
by developing general models and proving theorems.</p>

<p>

Pioneered in the 18th century by Nicolas de Condorcet and
Jean-Charles de Borda and in the 19th century by Charles Dodgson (also
known as Lewis Carroll), social choice theory took off in the 20th
century with the works of Kenneth Arrow, Amartya Sen, and Duncan Black.
Its influence extends across economics, political science, philosophy,
mathematics, and recently computer science and biology. Apart from
contributing to our understanding of collective decision procedures,
social choice theory has applications in the areas of institutional
design, welfare economics, and social epistemology.</p>

<h2><a id="HisSocChoThe">1. History of social choice theory</a></h2>

<h3><a id="Con">1.1 Condorcet</a></h3>

<p>

The two scholars most often associated with the development of
social choice theory are the Frenchman Nicolas de Condorcet (1743&ndash;1794)
and the American Kenneth Arrow (born 1921). Condorcet was a liberal
thinker in the era of the French Revolution who was pursued by the
revolutionary authorities for criticizing them. After a period of
hiding, he was eventually arrested, though apparently not immediately
identified, and he died in prison (for more details on Condorcet, see
McLean and Hewitt 1994). In his <em>Essay on the Application of
Analysis to the Probability of Majority Decisions</em> (1785), he
advocated a particular voting system, pairwise majority voting, and
presented his two most prominent insights. The first, known as
<em>Condorcet's jury theorem</em>, is that if each member of a
jury has an equal and independent chance better than random, but worse
than perfect, of making a correct judgment on whether a defendant is
guilty (or on some other factual proposition), the majority of jurors
is more likely to be correct than each individual juror, and the
probability of a correct majority judgment approaches 1 as the jury
size increases. Thus, under certain conditions, majority rule is good
at &lsquo;tracking the truth&rsquo; (e.g., Grofman, Owen, and Feld
1983; List and Goodin 2001).</p>

<p>

Condorcet's second insight, often called <em>Condorcet's
paradox</em>, is the observation that majority preferences can be
&lsquo;irrational&rsquo; (specifically, intransitive) even when
individual preferences are &lsquo;rational&rsquo; (specifically,
transitive). Suppose, for example, that one third of a group prefers
alternative <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> to <em>z</em>, a second third
prefers <em>y</em> to <em>z</em> to <em>x</em>, and a final third
prefers <em>z</em> to <em>x</em> to <em>y</em>. Then there are
majorities (of two thirds) for <em>x</em> against <em>y</em>, for
<em>y</em> against <em>z</em>, and for <em>z</em> against <em>x</em>: a
&lsquo;cycle&rsquo;, which violates transitivity. Furthermore, no
alternative is a <em>Condorcet winner</em>, an alternative that beats,
or at least ties with, every other alternative in pairwise majority
contests.</p>

<p>

Condorcet anticipated a key theme of modern social choice theory:
majority rule is at once a plausible method of collective decision
making and yet subject to some surprising problems. Resolving or
bypassing these problems remains one of social choice theory's
core concerns.</p>

<h3><a id="ArrHisInf">1.2 Arrow and his influence</a></h3>
<p>

While Condorcet had investigated a <em>particular</em> voting method
(majority voting), Arrow, who won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics
in 1972, introduced a <em>general</em> approach to the study of preference
aggregation, partly inspired by his teacher of logic, Alfred Tarski
(1901&ndash;1983), from whom he had learnt relation theory as an undergraduate
at the City College of New York (Suppes 2005). Arrow considered a class
of <em>possible</em> aggregation methods, which he called <em>social
welfare functions</em>, and asked which of them satisfy certain axioms
or desiderata. He proved that, surprisingly, there exists no method for
aggregating the preferences of two or more individuals over three or
more alternatives into collective preferences, where this method
satisfies five seemingly plausible axioms, discussed below.</p>

<p>

This result, known as <em>Arrow's impossibility theorem</em>,
prompted much work and many debates in social choice theory and welfare
economics. William Riker (1920&ndash;1993), who inspired the Rochester school
in political science, interpreted it as a mathematical proof of the
impossibility of populist democracy (e.g., Riker 1982). Others, most
prominently Amartya Sen (born 1933), who won the 1998 Nobel Memorial
Prize, took it to show that ordinal preferences are insufficient for
making satisfactory social choices. Commentators also questioned
whether Arrow's desiderata on an aggregation method are as
innocuous as claimed or whether they should be relaxed.</p>

<p>

The lessons from Arrow's theorem depend, in part, on how we interpret
an Arrovian social welfare function. The use of ordinal preferences as
the &lsquo;aggregenda&rsquo; may be easier to justify if we interpret
the aggregation rule as a <em>voting method</em> than if we interpret
it as a <em>welfare evaluation method</em>. Sen argued that when a
social planner seeks to rank different social alternatives in an order
of social welfare (thereby employing some aggregation rule as a
welfare evaluation method), it may be justifiable to use additional
information over and above ordinal preferences, such as
interpersonally comparable welfare measurements (e.g., Sen 1982).</p>

<p>

Arrow himself held the view </p>

<blockquote><p>
that interpersonal comparison of
utilities has no meaning and &hellip; that there is no meaning relevant
to welfare comparisons in the measurability of individual
utility. (1951/1963: 9)</p></blockquote>

<p>
 This view was influenced by
neoclassical economics, associated with scholars such as Vilfredo
Pareto (1848&ndash;1923), Lionel Robbins (1898&ndash;1984), John Hicks (1904&ndash;1989),
co-winner of the Economics Nobel Prize with Arrow, and Paul Samuelson
(1915&ndash;2009), another Nobel Laureate. Arrow's theorem demonstrates
the stark implications of the &lsquo;ordinalist&rsquo; assumptions of
neoclassical thought.</p>

<p>

Nowadays most social choice theorists have moved beyond the early
negative interpretations of Arrow's theorem and are interested in
the trade-offs involved in finding satisfactory decision procedures.
Sen has promoted this &lsquo;possibilist&rsquo; interpretation of
social choice theory (e.g., in his 1998 Nobel lecture).</p>

<p>

Within this approach, Arrow's axiomatic method is perhaps even
more influential than his impossibility theorem (on the axiomatic
method, see Thomson 2000). The paradigmatic kind of result in
contemporary axiomatic work is the &lsquo;characterization
theorem&rsquo;. Here the aim is to identify a set of plausible
necessary and sufficient conditions that uniquely characterize a
particular solution (or class of solutions) to a given type of
collective decision problem. An early example is Kenneth May's
(1952) characterization of majority rule, discussed below.</p>

<h3><a id="BorCarBlaOth">1.3 Borda, Carroll, Black, and others</a></h3>

<p>

Condorcet and Arrow are not the only founding figures of social
choice theory. Condorcet's contemporary and co-national
Jean-Charles de Borda (1733&ndash;1799) defended a voting system that is
often seen as a prominent alternative to majority voting. The <em>Borda
count</em>, formally defined later, avoids Condorcet's paradox
but violates one of Arrow's conditions, the <em>independence of
irrelevant alternatives</em>. Thus the debate between Condorcet and
Borda is a precursor to some modern debates on how to respond to
Arrow's theorem. </p>

<p>

The origins of this debate precede Condorcet and Borda. In the
Middle Ages, Ramon Llull (c1235&ndash;1315) proposed the aggregation method
of pairwise majority voting, while Nicolas Cusanus (1401&ndash;1464) proposed
a variant of the Borda count (McLean 1990). In 1672, the German
statesman and scholar Samuel von Pufendorf (1632&ndash;1694) compared simple
majority, qualified majority, and unanimity rules and offered an
analysis of the structure of preferences that can be seen as a
precursor to later discoveries (e.g., on <em>single-peakedness</em>,
discussed below) (Gaertner 2005).</p>

<p>

In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the British mathematician and
clergyman Charles Dodgson (1832&ndash;1898), better known as Lewis Carroll,
independently rediscovered many of Condorcet's and Borda's
insights and also developed a theory of proportional representation. It
was largely thanks to the Scottish economist Duncan Black (1908&ndash;1991)
that Condorcet's, Borda's, and Dodgson's
social-choice-theoretic ideas were drawn to the attention of the modern
research community (McLean, McMillan, and Monroe 1995). Black also made
several discoveries related to majority voting, some of which are
discussed below.</p>

<p>

In France, George-Th&eacute;odule Guilbaud ([1952] 1966) wrote an
important but often overlooked paper, revisiting Condorcet's
theory of voting from a logical perspective and sparking a French
literature on the <em>Condorcet effect</em>, the logical problem
underlying Condorcet's paradox, which has only recently received
more attention in Anglophone social choice theory (Monjardet 2005). For
further contributions on the history of social choice theory, see McLean,
McMillan, and Monroe (1996), McLean and Urken (1995), McLean and Hewitt
(1994), and a special issue of <em>Social Choice and Welfare</em>,
edited by Salles (2005).</p>

<h2><a id="ThrForArgForMajRul">2. Three formal arguments for majority rule</a></h2>

<p>

To introduce social choice theory formally, it helps to consider a
simple decision problem: a collective choice between two
alternatives.</p>

<h3><a id="ConAggRul">2.1 The concept of an aggregation rule</a></h3>

<p>

Let <em>N</em> = {1, 2, &hellip;, <em>n</em>} be a set of
individuals, where <em>n</em> &ge; 2. The individuals have to choose
between two alternatives (candidates, policies etc.). Each individual
<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> casts a vote, denoted
<em>v<sub>i</sub></em>, where</p>

<ul>
<li><em>v<sub>i</sub></em> = 1 represents a vote for the first
alternative,</li>
<li><em>v<sub>i</sub></em> = &minus;1 represents a vote for the second
alternative, and optionally</li>
<li><em>v<sub>i</sub></em> = 0 represents an abstention (for simplicity,
we set this possibility aside).</li>
</ul>

<p>

A combination of votes across the individuals,
&lt;<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>v<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, is called a <em>profile</em>. For any
profile, the group seeks to arrive at a social decision <em>v</em>,
where</p>

<ul>
<li><em>v</em>= 1 represents a decision for the first alternative,</li>
<li><em>v</em> = &minus;1 represents a decision for the second alternative, and</li>
<li><em>v</em> = 0 represents a tie.</li>
</ul>

<p>

An <em>aggregation rule</em> is a function <em>f</em> that assigns
to each profile &lt;<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>v<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; (in some domain of admissible
profiles) a social decision <em>v</em> =
<em>f</em>(<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>v<sub>n</sub></em>). Examples are:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Majority rule</em>: For each profile
&lt;<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>v<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;,</p>

<p>

Two points about the concept of an aggregation rule are worth
noting. First, under the standard definition, an aggregation rule is
defined <em>extensionally</em>, not <em>intensionally</em>: it is a
<em>mapping</em> (<em>functional relationship</em>) between individual
inputs and collective outputs, not a <em>set of explicit
instructions</em> (a <em>rule</em> in the ordinary-language sense) that
could be extended to inputs outside the function's formal domain.
Secondly, an aggregation rule is defined for a fixed set of individuals
<em>N</em> and a fixed decision problem, so that majority rule in a
group of two individuals is a different mathematical object from
majority rule in a group of three.</p>

<p>

To illustrate, Tables 1 and 2 show majority rule for these two group
sizes as extensional objects. The rows of each table correspond to the
different possible profiles of votes; the final column displays the
resulting social decisions.</p>

<p>

The present way of representing an aggregation rule helps us see how
many possible aggregation rules there are (see also List 2011). Suppose
there are <em>k</em> profiles in the domain of admissible inputs (in
the present example, 
<span class="nw"><em>k</em> = 2<em><sup>n</sup></em>,</span> since each of
the <em>n</em> individuals has two choices, with abstention
disallowed). Suppose, further, there are <em>l</em> possible social
decisions for each profile (in the example, 
<span class="nw"><em>l</em> = 3,</span> allowing
ties). Then there are <em>l<sup>k</sup></em> possible aggregation
rules: the relevant table has <em>k</em> rows, and in each row, there
are <em>l</em> possible ways of specifying the final entry (the
collective decision). Thus the number of possible aggregation rules
grows exponentially with the number of admissible profiles and the
number of possible decision outcomes.</p>

<p>

To select an aggregation rule non-arbitrarily from this large class
of possible ones, some constraints are needed. I now consider three
formal arguments for majority rule.</p>

<h3><a id="ProArgForMajRul">2.2 A procedural argument for majority rule</a></h3>
<p>

The first involves imposing some &lsquo;procedural&rsquo;
requirements on the relationship between individual votes and social
decisions and showing that majority rule is the only aggregation rule
satisfying them. May (1952) introduced four such requirements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Universal domain</em>: The domain of admissible inputs of the
aggregation rule consists of all logically possible profiles of votes
&lt;<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>v<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, where each 
<span class="nw"><em>v<sub>i</sub></em> &isin; {&minus;1,1}.</span></p>
<p>

<em>Anonymity</em>: For any admissible profiles
&lt;<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>v<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and &lt;<em>w</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>w</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>w<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; that
are permutations of each other (i.e., one can be obtained from the
other by reordering the entries), the social decision is the same,
i.e., <em>f</em>(<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>v<sub>n</sub></em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>w</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>w</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>w<sub>n</sub></em>).</p>

<p>

<em>Neutrality</em>: For any admissible profile
&lt;<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>v<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, if the votes for the two alternatives
are reversed, the social decision is reversed too, i.e.,
<em>f</em>(&minus;<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, &minus;<em>v</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, &minus;<em>v<sub>n</sub></em>) =
&minus;<em>f</em>(<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>v<sub>n</sub></em>).</p>

<p>

<em>Positive responsiveness</em>: For any admissible profile
&lt;<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>v<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, if some voters change their votes in
favour of one alternative (say the first) and all other votes remain
the same, the social decision does not change in the opposite
direction; if the social decision was a tie prior to the change, the
tie is broken in the direction of the change, i.e., if
[<em>w<sub>i</sub></em> &gt; <em>v<sub>i</sub></em> for some
<em>i</em> and <em>w<sub>j</sub></em> = <em>v<sub>j</sub></em> for all
other <em>j</em>] and <em>f</em>(<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>v</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>v<sub>n</sub></em>) = 0 or 1,
then <em>f</em>(<em>w</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>w</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>w<sub>n</sub></em>) = 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

Universal domain requires the aggregation rule to cope with any
level of &lsquo;pluralism&rsquo; in its inputs; anonymity requires it
to treat all voters equally; neutrality requires it to treat all
alternatives equally; and positive responsiveness requires the social
decision to be a positive function of the way people vote. May proved
the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Theorem</em> (May 1952): An aggregation rule satisfies universal
domain, anonymity, neutrality, and positive responsiveness if and only
if it is majority rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Apart from providing an argument for majority rule based on four
plausible procedural desiderata, the theorem helps us characterize
other aggregation rules in terms of which desiderata they violate.
Dictatorships and weighted majority rules with unequal individual
weights violate anonymity. Asymmetrical supermajority rules (under
which a supermajority of the votes, such as two thirds or three
quarters, is required for a decision in favour of one of the
alternatives, while the other alternative is the default choice)
violate neutrality. This may sometimes be justifiable, for instance
when there is a presumption in favour of one alternative, such as a
presumption of innocence in a jury decision. Symmetrical supermajority
rules (under which neither alternative is chosen unless it is supported
by a sufficiently large supermajority) violate positive responsiveness.
A more far-fetched example of an aggregation rule violating positive
responsiveness is the inverse majority rule (here the alternative
<em>rejected</em> by a majority wins).</p>

<h3><a id="EpiArgForMajRul">2.3 An epistemic argument for majority rule</a></h3>
<p>

Condorcet's jury theorem provides a consequentialist argument
for majority rule. The argument is &lsquo;epistemic&rsquo;, insofar as
the aggregation rule is interpreted as a truth-tracking device (e.g.,
Grofman, Owen and Feld 1983; List and Goodin 2001). </p>

<p>

Suppose the aim is to make a judgment on some procedure-independent
fact or state of the world, denoted <em>X</em>. In a jury decision, the
defendant is either guilty (<em>X</em> = 1) or innocent (<em>X</em> =
&minus;1). In an expert-panel decision on the safety of some technology, the
technology may be either safe (<em>X</em> = 1) or not (<em>X</em> =
&minus;1). Each individual's vote expresses a judgment on that fact or
state, and the social decision represents the collective judgment. The
goal is to reach a factually correct collective judgment. Which
aggregation rule performs best at &lsquo;tracking the truth&rsquo; depends
on the relationship between the individual votes and the relevant fact
or state of the world.</p>

<p>

Condorcet assumed that each individual is better than random at
making a correct judgment (the competence assumption) and that
different individuals' judgments are stochastically independent,
given the state of the world (the independence assumption). Formally,
let <em>V</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>V</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>V<sub>n</sub></em> (capital letters) denote the random variables
generating the specific individual votes <em>v</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>v</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>v<sub>n</sub></em> (small
letters), and let <em>V</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>V</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>V</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>V<sub>n</sub></em>) denote the
resulting random variable representing the social decision <em>v</em> =
<em>f</em>(<em>v</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>v</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>v<sub>n</sub></em>) under a given aggregation rule
<em>f</em>, such as majority rule. Condorcet's assumptions can be
stated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Competence</em>: For each individual <em>i</em> &isin;
<em>N</em> and each state of the world <em>x</em> &isin; {&minus;1,1},
Pr(<em>V<sub>i</sub></em> = <em>x</em> |
<em>X</em> = <em>x</em>) =
<em>p</em> &gt; 1/2, where <em>p</em> is the same across
individuals and states.</p>

<p>

<em>Independence</em>: The votes of different individuals
<em>V</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>V</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>V<sub>n</sub></em> are independent of each other, conditional on
each value <em>x</em> &isin; {&minus;1,1} of <em>X</em>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

Under these assumptions, majority voting is a good
truth-tracker:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Theorem</em> (Condorcet's jury theorem): For each state of
the world <span class="nw"><em>x</em> &isin; {&minus;1,1},</span> the probability of a correct
majority decision, <span class="nw">Pr(<em>V</em> = <em>x</em></span> |
<span class="nw"><em>X</em> =
<em>x</em>),</span> is greater than each individual's probability of a
correct vote, 
<span class="nw">Pr(<em>V<sub>i</sub></em> = <em>x</em></span> |
<span class="nw"><em>X</em> =
<em>x</em>),</span> and converges to 1, as the number of individuals
<em>n</em>
 increases.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup></p>

</blockquote>

<p>

The first conjunct (&lsquo;is greater than each individual's
probability&rsquo;) is the <em>non-asymptotic conclusion</em>, the
second (&lsquo;converges to 1&rsquo;) the <em>asymptotic
conclusion</em>. One can further show that, if the two states of the
world have an equal prior probability (i.e., Pr(<em>X</em> = 1) =
Pr(<em>X</em> = &minus;1) = 1/2), majority rule is the most reliable of all
aggregation rules, maximizing Pr(<em>V</em> = <em>X</em>) (e.g.,
Ben-Yashar and Nitzan 1997).</p>

<p>

Although the jury theorem is often invoked to establish the
epistemic merits of democracy, its assumptions are highly idealistic.
The competence assumption is not a conceptual claim but an empirical
one and depends on any given decision problem. Although an average (not
necessarily equal) individual competence above 1/2 may be sufficient
for Condorcet's conclusion (e.g., Grofman, Owen, and Feld 1983;
Boland 1989; Kanazawa
 1998),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup>
the theorem ceases to hold if individuals are randomizers (no better
and no worse than a coin toss) or if they are worse than random
(<em>p</em> &lt; 1/2). In the latter case, the probability of a
correct majority decision is <em>less</em> than each individual's
probability of a correct vote and converges to 0, as the jury size
increases. The theorem's conclusion can also be undermined in
less extreme cases (Berend and Paroush 1998), for instance when each
individual's reliability, though above 1/2, is an exponentially
decreasing function approaching 1/2 with increasing jury size (List
2003a).</p>
<p>

Similarly, whether the independence assumption is true depends on
the decision problem in question. Although Condorcet's conclusion
is robust to the presence of some interdependencies between individual
votes, the structure of these interdependencies matters (e.g., Boland
1989; Ladha 1992; Estlund 1994; Dietrich and List 2004; Berend and
Sapir 2007; Dietrich and Spiekermann 2013). If all individuals'
votes are perfectly correlated with one another or mimic a small number
of opinion leaders, the collective judgment is no more reliable than
the judgment among a small number of independent individuals.</p>

<p>

Bayesian networks, as employed in Pearl's work on causation
(2000), have been used to model the effects of voter dependencies on
the jury theorem and to distinguish between stronger and weaker
variants of conditional independence (Dietrich and List 2004; Dietrich
and Spiekermann 2013). Dietrich (2008) has argued that
Condorcet's two assumptions are never simultaneously justified,
in the sense that, even when they are both true, one cannot obtain
evidence to support both at once.</p>

<p>

Finally, game-theoretic work challenges an implicit assumption of
the jury theorem, namely that voters will always reveal their judgments
truthfully. Even if all voters prefer a correct to an incorrect
collective judgment, they may still have incentives to misrepresent
their individual judgments. This can happen when, conditional on the
event of being pivotal for the outcome, a voter expects a higher chance
of bringing about a correct collective judgment by voting
<em>against</em> his or her own private judgment than in line with it
(Austin-Smith and Banks 1996; Feddersen and Pesendorfer 1998).</p>

<h3><a id="UtiArgForMajRul">2.4 A utilitarian argument for majority rule</a></h3>
<p>

Another consequentialist argument for majority rule is utilitarian
rather than epistemic. It does not require the existence of an
independent fact or state of the world that the collective decision is
supposed to track. Suppose each voter gets some utility from the
collective decision, which depends on whether the decision matches his
or her vote (preference): specifically, each voter gets a utility of 1
from a match between his or her vote and the collective outcome and a
utility of 0 from a
 mismatch.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup>
The Rae-Taylor theorem then states that if each individual has an equal
prior probability of preferring each of the two alternatives, majority
rule maximizes each individual's expected utility (see, e.g.,
Mueller 2003).</p>

<p>

Relatedly, majority rule minimizes the number of frustrated voters
(defined as voters on the losing side) and maximizes total utility
across voters. Brighouse and Fleurbaey (2010) generalize this result.
Define voter <em>i</em>'s <em>stake</em> in the decision,
<em>d</em><em><sub>i</sub></em>, as the utility difference between his
or her preferred outcome and his or her dispreferred outcome. The
Rae-Taylor theorem rests on an implicit equal-stakes assumption, i.e.,
<em>d</em><em><sub>i</sub></em> = 1 for every <em>i</em> &isin;
<em>N</em>. Brighouse and Fleurbaey show that when stakes are allowed
to vary across voters, total utility is maximized not by majority rule,
but by a weighted majority rule, where each individual
<em>i</em>'s voting weight <em>w<sub>i</sub></em> is proportional
to his or her stake <em>d</em><em><sub>i</sub></em>.</p>

<h2><a id="PreAgg">3. Preference aggregation</a></h2>
<p>

At the heart of social choice theory is the analysis of preference
aggregation, understood as the aggregation of several
individuals' preference rankings of two or more social
alternatives into a single, collective preference ranking (or choice)
over these alternatives.</p>

<p>

The basic model is as follows. Again, consider a set <em>N</em> =
{1, 2, &hellip;, <em>n</em>} of individuals (<em>n</em> &ge; 2). Let
<em>X</em> = {<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>, &hellip;} be a set of
social alternatives, for example possible worlds, policy platforms,
election candidates, or allocations of goods. Each individual
<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> has a <em>preference ordering</em>
<em>R<sub>i</sub></em> over these alternatives: a complete and
 transitive binary relation on <em>X</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup>
For any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin; <em>X</em>,
<em>xR<sub>i</sub>y</em> means that individual <em>i</em> weakly
prefers <em>x</em> to <em>y</em>. We write <em>xP<sub>i</sub>y</em> if
<em>xR<sub>i</sub>y</em> and not <em>yR<sub>i</sub>x</em>
(&lsquo;individual <em>i</em> strictly prefers <em>x</em> to
<em>y</em>&rsquo;), and <em>xI<sub>i</sub>y</em> if
<em>xR<sub>i</sub>y</em> and <em>yR<sub>i</sub>x</em>
(&lsquo;individual <em>i</em> is indifferent between <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em>&rsquo;).</p>

<p>

A combination of preference orderings across the individuals,
&lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, is called a <em>profile</em>. A
<em>preference aggregation rule</em>, <em>F</em>, is a function that
assigns to each profile &lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; (in
some domain of admissible profiles) a social preference relation
<em>R</em> = <em>F</em>(<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>) on <em>X</em>. When <em>F</em> is
clear from the context, we simply write <em>R</em> for the social
preference relation corresponding to &lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;.</p>

<p>

For any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin; <em>X</em>, <em>xRy</em>
means that <em>x</em> is socially weakly preferred to <em>y</em>. We
also write <em>xPy</em> if <em>xRy</em> and not <em>yRx</em>
(&lsquo;<em>x</em> is strictly socially preferred to
<em>y</em>&rsquo;), and <em>xIy</em> if <em>xRy</em> and <em>yRx</em>
(&lsquo;<em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are socially tied&rsquo;). For
generality, the requirement that <em>R</em> be complete and transitive
is not built into the definition of a preference aggregation rule.</p>

<p>

The paradigmatic example of a preference aggregation rule is
<em>pairwise majority voting</em>, as discussed by Condorcet. Here, for
any profile &lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>
&isin; <em>X</em>, <em>xRy</em> if and only if at least as many
individuals have <em>xR<sub>i</sub>y</em> as have
<em>yR<sub>i</sub>x</em>, formally 
<span class="nw">|{<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> :
<em>xR<sub>i</sub>y</em>}|</span> &ge; 
<span class="nw">|{<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> : <em>yR<sub>i</sub>x</em>}|.</span> As we have seen, this does not guarantee
transitive social
 preferences.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

How frequent are intransitive majority preferences? It can be shown
that the proportion of preference profiles (among all possible ones)
that lead to cyclical majority preferences increases with the number of
individuals (<em>n</em>) and the number of alternatives (|<em>X|</em>).
If all possible preference profiles are equally likely to occur (the
so-called &lsquo;impartial culture&rsquo; scenario), majority cycles
should therefore be probable in large electorates (Gehrlein 1983).
(Technical work further distinguishes between &lsquo;top-cycles&rsquo;
and cycles below a possible Condorcet-winning alternative.) However,
the probability of cycles can be significantly lower under certain
systematic, even small, deviations from an impartial culture (List and
Goodin 2001: Appendix 3; Tsetlin, Regenwetter, and Grofman 2003;
Regenwetter et al. 2006).</p>

<h3><a id="ArrThe">3.1 Arrow's theorem</a></h3>
<p>

Abstracting from pairwise majority voting, Arrow introduced the
following conditions on a preference aggregation rule, <em>F</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Universal domain</em>: The domain of <em>F</em> is the set of
all logically possible profiles of complete and transitive individual
preference orderings.</p>

<p>

<em>Ordering</em>: For any profile &lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; in the
domain of <em>F</em>, the social preference relation <em>R</em> is
complete and transitive.</p>

<p>

<em>Weak Pareto principle</em>: For any profile
&lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; in the domain of <em>F</em>, if for all
<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> <em>xP<sub>i</sub>y</em>, then
<em>xPy</em>.</p>
<p>

<em>Independence of irrelevant alternatives</em>: For any two
profiles &lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and
&lt;<em>R*</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R*</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R*<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; in the domain of <em>F</em> and any
<em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin; <em>X</em>, if for all <em>i</em>
&isin; <em>N</em> <em>R<sub>i</sub></em>'s ranking between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> coincides with <em>R*<sub>i</sub></em>'s ranking between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, then <em>xRy</em> if and only if <em>xR*y</em>.</p>

<p>

<em>Non-dictatorship</em>: There does not exist an individual
<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> such that, for all
&lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; in the domain of <em>F</em> and all
<em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin; <em>X</em>, <em>xP<sub>i</sub>y</em>
implies <em>xPy</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Universal domain requires the aggregation rule to cope with any
level of &lsquo;pluralism&rsquo; in its inputs. Ordering requires it to
produce &lsquo;rational&rsquo; social preferences, avoiding Condorcet
cycles. The weak Pareto principle requires that when all individuals
strictly prefer alternative <em>x</em> to alternative <em>y</em>, so
does society. Independence of irrelevant alternatives requires that the
social preference between any two alternatives <em>x</em> and
<em>y</em> depend only on the individual preferences between <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em>, not on individuals' preferences over other
alternatives. Non-dictatorship requires that there be no
&lsquo;dictator&rsquo;, who always determines the social preference,
regardless of other individuals' preferences. (Note that pairwise
majority voting satisfies all of these conditions except ordering.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Theorem</em> (Arrow 1951/1963): If |<em>X</em>| &gt; 2,
there exists no preference aggregation rule satisfying universal
domain, ordering, the weak Pareto principle, independence of irrelevant
alternatives, and non-dictatorship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

It is evident that this result carries over to the aggregation of
other kinds of orderings, as distinct from preference orderings, such
as (i) belief orderings over several hypotheses (ordinal credences),
(ii) multiple criteria that a single decision maker may use to generate
an all-things-considered ordering of several decision options, and
(iii) conflicting value rankings to be reconciled.</p>

<p>

Examples of other such aggregation problems to which Arrow's
theorem has been applied include: intrapersonal aggregation problems
(e.g., May 1954; Hurley 1985), constraint aggregation in optimality
theory in linguistics (e.g., Harbour and List 2000), theory choice
(e.g., Okasha 2011; cf. Morreau forthcoming), evidence amalgamation
(e.g., Stegenga 2013), and the aggregation of multiple similarity
orderings into an all-things-considered similarity ordering (e.g.,
Morreau 2010; Kroedel and Huber 2013). In each case, the plausibility
of Arrow's theorem depends on the case-specific plausibility of
Arrow's ordinalist framework and the theorem's
conditions.</p>

<p>

Generally, if we consider Arrow's framework appropriate and
his conditions indispensable, Arrow's theorem raises a serious
challenge. To avoid it, we must relax at least one of the five
conditions or give up the restriction of the aggregation rule's
inputs to orderings and defend the use of richer inputs, as discussed
in <a href="#WelAgg">Section 4.</a></p>

<h3><a id="NonDicPreAggRul">3.2 Non-dictatorial preference aggregation rules</a></h3>

<h4>3.2.1 Relaxing universal domain</h4>

<p>

One way to avoid Arrow's theorem is to relax universal domain.
If the aggregation rule is required to accept as input only preference
profiles that satisfy certain &lsquo;cohesion&rsquo; conditions, then
aggregation rules such as pairwise majority voting will produce
complete and transitive social preferences. The best-known cohesion
condition is <em>single-peakedness</em> (Black 1948).</p>

<p>

A profile &lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; is <em>single-peaked</em> if
the alternatives can be aligned from &lsquo;left&rsquo; to
&lsquo;right&rsquo; (e.g., on some cognitive or ideological dimension)
such that each individual has a most preferred position on that
alignment with decreasing preference as alternatives get more distant
(in either direction) from the most preferred position. Formally, this
requires the existence of a linear ordering &Omega; on 
<em>X</em> such that, for every triple of alternatives <em>x</em>,
<em>y</em>, <em>z</em> &isin; <em>X</em>, if <em>y</em> lies between
<em>x</em> and <em>z</em> with respect to &Omega;, it is not the case that
<em>xR<sub>i</sub>y</em> and <em>zR<sub>i</sub>x</em> (this rules out a
&lsquo;cave&rsquo; between <em>x</em> and <em>z</em>, at <em>y</em>).
Single-peakedness is plausible in some democratic contexts. If the
alternatives in <em>X</em> are different tax rates, for example, each
individual may have a most preferred tax rate (which will be lower for
a libertarian individual than for a socialist) and prefer other tax
rates less as they get more distant from the ideal.</p>

<p>

Black (1948) proved that if the domain of the aggregation rule is
restricted to the set of all profiles of individual preference
orderings satisfying single-peakedness, majority cycles cannot occur,
and the most preferred alternative of the median individual relative to
the relevant left-right alignment is a Condorcet winner (assuming
<em>n</em> is odd). Pairwise majority voting then satisfies the rest of
Arrow's conditions.</p>

<p>

Other domain-restriction conditions with similar implications
include <em>single-cavedness</em>, a geometrical mirror image of
single-peakedness (Inada 1964), <em>separability into two groups</em>
(<em>ibid.</em>), and <em>latin-squarelessness</em> (Ward 1965), the latter two
more complicated combinatorial conditions (for a review, see Gaertner
2001). Sen (1966) showed that all these conditions imply a weaker
condition, <em>triple-wise value-restriction</em>. It requires that,
for every triple of alternatives <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>
&isin; <em>X</em>, there exists one alternative in {<em>x</em>,
<em>y</em>, <em>z</em>} and one rank <em>r</em> &isin; {1, 2, 3} such
that no individual ranks that alternative in <em>r</em><sup>th</sup>
place among <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>. For instance, all
individuals may agree that <em>y</em> is not bottom (<em>r</em> = 3)
among <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em>. Triple-wise
value-restriction suffices for transitive majority preferences (for a simple proof of Sen's theorem, see Elsholtz and List 2005).</p>

<p>

There has been much discussion on whether, and under what
conditions, real-world preferences fall into such a restricted domain.
It has been suggested, for example, that group deliberation can induce
single-peaked preferences, by leading participants to focus on a shared
cognitive or ideological dimension (Miller 1992; Knight and Johnson
1994; Dryzek and List 2003). Experimental evidence from deliberative
opinion polls is consistent with this hypothesis (List, Luskin,
Fishkin, and McLean 2013), though further empirical work is needed.</p>

<h4>3.2.2 Relaxing ordering</h4>
<p>

Preference aggregation rules are normally expected to produce
orderings as their outputs, but sometimes we may only require partial
orderings or not fully transitive binary relations. An aggregation rule
that produces transitive but often incomplete social preferences is the
<em>Pareto dominance procedure</em>: here, for any profile
&lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>, <em>xRy</em> if and only if, for all <em>i</em> &isin;
<em>N</em>, <em>xP<sub>i</sub>y</em>. An aggregation rule that produces
complete but often intransitive social preferences is the <em>Pareto
extension procedure</em>: here, for any profile
&lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>, <em>xRy</em> if and only if it is not the case that, for
all <em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em>, <em>yP<sub>i</sub>x</em>. Both rules
have a unanimitarian spirit, giving each individual veto power either
against the <em>presence</em> of a weak social preference for
<em>x</em> over <em>y</em> or against its <em>absence</em>.</p>

<p>

Gibbard (1969) proved that even if we replace the requirement of
transitivity with what he called <em>quasi-transitivity</em>, the
resulting possibilities of aggregation are still very limited. Call a
preference relation <em>R</em> <em>quasi-transitive</em> if the induced
strict relation <em>P</em> is transitive (while the indifference
relation <em>I</em> need not be transitive). Call an aggregation rule
<em>oligarchic</em> if there is a subset <em>M</em> &sube; <em>N</em>
(the &lsquo;oligarchs&rsquo;) such that (i) if, for all <em>i</em>
&isin; <em>M</em>, <em>xP<sub>i</sub>y</em>, then <em>xPy</em>, and
(ii) if, for some <em>i</em> &isin; <em>M</em>,
<em>xP<sub>i</sub>y</em>, then <em>xRy</em>. The Pareto extension
procedure is an example of an oligarchic aggregation rule with
<em>M</em> = <em>N</em>. In an oligarchy, the oligarchs are jointly
decisive and have individual veto power. Gibbard proved the
following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Theorem</em> (Gibbard 1969): If |<em>X</em>| &gt; 2, there
exists no preference aggregation rule satisfying universal domain,
quasi-transitivity and completeness of social preferences, the weak
Pareto principle, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and
non-oligarchy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>3.2.3 Relaxing the weak Pareto principle</h4>

<p>

The weak Pareto principle is arguably hard to give up. One case in
which we may lift it is that of spurious unanimity, where a unanimous
preference for <em>x</em> over <em>y</em> is based on mutually
inconsistent reasons (e.g., Mongin 1997; Gilboa, Samet, and Schmeidler
2004). Two men may each prefer to fight a duel (alternative <em>x</em>)
to not fighting it (alternative <em>y</em>) because each over-estimates
his chances of winning. There may exist no mutually agreeable
probability assignment over possible outcomes of the duel (i.e., who
would win) that would &lsquo;rationalize&rsquo; the unanimous
preference for <em>x</em> over <em>y</em>. In this case, the unanimous
preference is a bad indicator of social preferability<em>.</em> This
example, however, depends on the fact that the alternatives of fighting
and not fighting are not fully specified outcomes but uncertain
prospects. Arguably, the weak Pareto principle is more plausible in
cases without uncertainty.</p>

<p>

An aggregation rule that becomes possible when the weak Pareto
principle is dropped is an <em>imposed procedure</em>, where, for any
profile &lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, the social preference
relation <em>R</em> is an antecedently fixed (&lsquo;imposed&rsquo;)
ordering <em>R<sub>imposed</sub></em> of the alternatives. Though
completely unresponsive to individual preferences, this aggregation
rule satisfies the rest of Arrow's conditions.</p>

<p>

Sen (1970a) offered another critique of the weak Pareto principle,
showing that it conflicts with a &lsquo;liberal&rsquo; principle. Here
we interpret the aggregation rule as a method a social planner can use
to rank social alternatives in an order of social welfare. Suppose each
individual in society is given some basic rights, to the effect that
his or her preference is sometimes socially decisive (i.e., cannot be
overridden by others' preferences). Each of Lewd and Prude, for
example, should be decisive over whether he himself reads a particular
book, <em>Lady Chatterley's Lover.</em></p>

<p>

<em>Minimal liberalism</em>: There are <em>at least</em> two
distinct individuals <em>i</em>, <em>j</em> &isin; <em>N</em> who are
each decisive on at least one pair of alternatives; i.e., there is at
least one pair of alternatives <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin;
<em>X</em> such that, for every profile &lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;,
<em>xP<sub>i</sub>y</em> implies <em>xPy</em>, and
<em>yP<sub>i</sub>x</em> implies <em>yPx</em>, and at least one pair of
alternatives <em>x</em>*, <em>y</em>* &isin; <em>X</em> such that, for
every profile &lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, <em>x*P<sub>j</sub>y*</em>
implies <em>x*Py*</em>, and <em>y*P<sub>j</sub>x*</em> implies
<em>y*Px*</em>.</p>

<p>

Sen asked us to imagine that Lewd most prefers that Prude read the
book (alternative <em>x</em>), second-most prefers that he read the
book himself (alternative <em>y</em>), and least prefers that neither
read the book (<em>z</em>). Prude most prefers that neither read the
book (<em>z</em>), second-most prefers that he read the book himself
(<em>x</em>), and least prefers that Lewd read the book (<em>y</em>).
Assuming Lewd is decisive over the pair <em>y</em> and <em>z</em>,
society should prefer <em>y</em> to <em>z</em>. Assuming Prude is
decisive over the pair <em>x</em> and <em>z</em>, society should prefer
<em>z</em> to <em>x</em>. But since Lewd and Prude both prefer
<em>x</em> to <em>y</em>, the weak Pareto principle (applied to
<em>N</em> = {Lewd, Prude}) implies that society should prefer
<em>x</em> to <em>y</em>. So, we are faced with a social preference
cycle. Sen called this problem the &lsquo;liberal paradox&rsquo; and
generalized it as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Theorem</em> (Sen 1970a): There exists no preference aggregation
rule satisfying universal domain, acyclicity of social preferences, the
weak Pareto principle, and minimal liberalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

The result suggests that if we wish to respect individual rights, we
may sometimes have to sacrifice Paretian efficiency. An alternative
conclusion is that the weak Pareto principle can be rendered compatible
with minimal liberalism only when the domain of admissible preference
profiles is suitably restricted, for instance to preferences that are
&lsquo;tolerant&rsquo; or not &lsquo;meddlesome&rsquo; (Blau 1975;
Craven 1982; Gigliotti 1986; Sen 1983). Lewd's and Prude's
preferences in Sen's example are &lsquo;meddlesome&rsquo;.</p>

<p>

Several authors have challenged the relevance of Sen's result,
however, by criticizing his formalization of rights (e.g., Gaertner,
Pattanaik, and Suzumura 1992; Dowding and van Hees 2003).</p>

<h4>3.2.4 Relaxing independence of irrelevant alternatives</h4>

<p>

A common way to obtain possible preference aggregation rules is to
give up independence of irrelevant alternatives. Almost all familiar
voting methods over three or more alternatives that involve some form
of preferential voting (with voters being asked to express full or
partial preference orderings) violate this condition.</p>

<p>

A standard example is <em>plurality rule</em>: here, for any profile
&lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>, <em>xRy</em> if and only if |{<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em>
: for all <em>z</em> &ne; <em>x</em>, <em>xP<sub>i</sub>z</em>}|
&ge; |{<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> : for all <em>z</em> &ne;
<em>y</em>, <em>yP<sub>i</sub>z</em>}|. Informally, alternatives are
socially ranked in the order of how many individuals most prefer each
of them. Plurality rule avoids Condorcet's paradox, but runs into
other problems. Most notably, an alternative that is
majority-dispreferred to every other alternative may win under
plurality rule: if 34% of the voters rank <em>x</em> above <em>y</em>
above <em>z</em>, 33% rank <em>y</em> above <em>z</em> above
<em>x</em>, and 33% rank <em>z</em> above <em>y</em> above <em>x</em>,
plurality rule ranks <em>x</em> above each of <em>y</em> and
<em>z</em>, while pairwise majority voting would rank <em>y</em> above
<em>z</em> above <em>x</em> (<em>y</em> is the Condorcet winner). By
disregarding individuals' lower-ranked alternatives, plurality
rule also violates the weak Pareto principle. However, plurality rule
may be plausible in &lsquo;restricted informational
environments&rsquo;, where the balloting procedure collects information
only about voters' top preferences, not about their full
preference rankings. Here plurality rule satisfies generalized variants
of May's four conditions introduced above (Goodin and List
2006).</p>

<p>

A second example of a preference aggregation rule that violates
independence of irrelevant alternatives is the <em>Borda count</em>
(e.g., Saari 1990). Here, for any profile
&lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>, <em>xRy</em> if and only if
&Sigma;<em><sub>i</sub></em><sub>&isin;</sub><em><sub>N</sub></em>|{<em>z</em>
&isin; <em>X</em> : <em>xR<sub>i</sub>z</em>}| &ge;
&Sigma;<em><sub>i</sub></em><sub>&isin;</sub><em><sub>N</sub></em>|{<em>z</em>
&isin; <em>X</em> : <em>yR<sub>i</sub>z</em>}|. Informally, each voter
assigns a score to each alternative, which depends on its rank in his
or her preference ranking. The most-preferred alternative gets a score
of <em>k</em> (where <em>k</em> = |<em>X</em>|), the
second-most-preferred alternative a score of 
<span class="nw"><em>k</em> &minus; 1,</span> the
third-most-preferred alternative a score of 
<span class="nw"><em>k</em> &minus; 2,</span> and so
on. Alternatives are then socially ordered in terms of the sums of
their scores across voters: the alternative with the largest sum-total
is top, the alternative with the second-largest sum-total next, and so
on.</p>

<p>

To see how this violates independence of irrelevant alternatives,
consider the two profiles of individual preference orderings over four
alternatives (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>, <em>w</em>) in Tables
3 and 4.</p>

<blockquote>
Table 3: A profile of individual preference orderings
<table class="inner-rules cell-center cellpad-small-dense">
<tr>
<td></td>
<th><em>Individual 1</em></th>
<th><em>Individuals <span class="nw">2 to 7</span></em></th>
<th><em>Individuals <span class="nw">8 to 15</span></em></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><em>1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;preference</em></th>
<td><em>y</em></td>
<td><em>x</em></td>
<td><em>z</em></td>

<tr>
<th><em>2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;preference</em></th>

<td><em>x</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><em>3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;preference</em></th>
<td><em>z</em></td>
<td><em>w</em></td>
<td><em>y</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><em>4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;preference</em></th>
<td><em>w</em></td>
<td><em>y</em></td>
<td><em>w</em></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Table 4: A slightly modified profile of individual preference orderings
<table class="inner-rules cell-center cellpad-small-dense">
<tr>
<td></td>
<th><em>Individual 1</em></th>
<th><em>Individuals <span class="nw">2 to 7</span></em></th>
<th><em>Individuals <span class="nw">8 to 15</span></em></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><em>1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;preference</em></th>
<td><em>x</em></td>
<td><em>x</em></td>
<td><em>z</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><em>2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;preference</em></th>
<td><em>y</em></td>
<td><em>z</em></td>
<td><em>x</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><em>3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;preference</em></th>
<td><em>w</em></td>
<td><em>w</em></td>
<td><em>y</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th><em>4<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;preference</em></th>
<td><em>z</em></td>
<td><em>y</em></td>
<td><em>w</em></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p>

In Table 3, the Borda scores of the four alternatives are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>x</em>: 9*3 + 6*4 = 51,</li>
<li><em>y</em>: 1*4 + 6*1 + 8*2 = 26,</li>
<li><em>z</em>: 1*2 + 6*3 + 8*4 = 52,</li>
<li><em>w</em>: 1*1 + 6*2 + 8*1 = 21,</li>
</ul>

<p>

leading to a social preference for <em>z</em> over <em>x</em> over
<em>y</em> over <em>w</em>. In Table 4 the Borda scores are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>x</em>: 7*4 + 8*3 = 52,</li>
<li><em>y</em>: 1*3 + 6*1 + 8*2 = 25,</li>
<li><em>z</em>: 1*1 + 6*3 + 8*4 = 51,</li>
<li><em>w</em>: 7*2 + 8*1 = 22,</li>
</ul>

<p>

leading to a social preference for <em>x</em> over <em>z</em> over
<em>y</em> over <em>w</em>. The only difference between the two
profiles lies in Individual 1's preference ordering, and even
here there is no change in the relative ranking of <em>x</em> and
<em>z</em>. Despite identical individual preferences between <em>x</em>
and <em>z</em> in Tables 3 and 4, the social preference between
<em>x</em> and <em>z</em> is reversed, a violation of independence of
irrelevant alternatives. </p>

<p>

Such violations are common in real-world voting rules, and they make
preference aggregation potentially vulnerable to strategic voting
and/or strategic agenda setting. I illustrate this in the case of
strategic voting.</p>

<h3><a id="GibSatThe">3.3 The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem</a></h3>

<p>

So far we have discussed <em>preference aggregation rules</em>,
which map profiles of individual preference orderings to social
preference relations. We now consider <em>social choice rules</em>,
whose output, instead, is one or several winning alternatives.
Formally, a <em>social choice rule</em>, <em>f</em>, is a function that
assigns to each profile &lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; (in
some domain of admissible profiles) a social choice set
<em>f</em>(<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R<sub>n</sub></em>) &sube; <em>X</em>. A social choice rule
<em>f</em> can be derived from a preference aggregation rule
<em>F</em>, by defining <em>f</em>(<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>) = {<em>x</em>
&isin; <em>X</em> : for all <em>y</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>, <em>xRy</em>} where <em>R</em> =
<em>F</em>(<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R<sub>n</sub></em>); the reverse does not generally hold. We call
the set of sometimes-chosen alternatives the <em>range</em> of
 <em>f</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

The <em>Condorcet winner criterion</em> defines a social choice
rule, where, for each profile &lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;,
<em>f</em>(<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R<sub>n</sub></em>) contains every alternative in <em>X</em> that
wins or at least ties with every other alternative in pairwise majority
voting. As shown by Condorcet's paradox, this may produce an
empty choice set. By contrast, plurality rule and the Borda count
induce social choice rules that always produce non-empty choice sets.
They also satisfy the following basic conditions (the last for |<em>X</em>| &ge; 3):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Universal Domain</em>: The domain of <em>f</em> is the set of
all logically possible profiles of complete and transitive individual
preference orderings.</p>

<p>

<em>Non-dictatorship</em>: There does not exist an individual
<span class="nw"><em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em></span> such that, for all
&lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; in the domain of <em>f</em> and all
<em>x</em> in the range of <em>f</em>, <em>yR<sub>i</sub>x</em> where
<em>y</em> &isin; <em>f</em>(<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
 <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

<em>The range constraint</em>: The range of <em>f</em> contains at
least three distinct alternatives (and ideally all alternatives in
<em>X</em>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

When supplemented with an appropriate tie-breaking criterion, the
plurality and Borda rules can further be made
&lsquo;resolute&rsquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Resoluteness</em>: The social choice rule <em>f</em> always
produces a unique winning alternative (a singleton choice set). (We
then write <em>x</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>) to denote the
winning alternative for the profile &lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Surprisingly, this list of conditions conflicts with the following
further requirement.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Strategy-proofness</em>: There does not exist a profile
&lt;<em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>R<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; in the domain of <em>f</em> at which
<em>f</em> is manipulable by some individual 
<span class="nw"><em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em>,</span> where <em>manipulability</em> means the following: if
<em>i</em> submits a <em>false</em> preference ordering
<em>R&prime;<sub>i</sub></em> (&ne; <em>R<sub>i</sub></em>), the winner
is an alternative <em>y&prime;</em> that <em>i</em> strictly prefers
(according to <em>R<sub>i</sub></em>) to the alternative <em>y</em>
that would win if <em>i</em> submitted the <em>true</em> preference
 ordering <em>R<sub>i</sub></em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

<em>Theorem</em> (Gibbard 1973; Satterthwaite 1975): There exists no
social choice rule satisfying universal domain, non-dictatorship, the
range constraint, resoluteness, and strategy-proofness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

This result raises important questions about the trade-offs between
different requirements on a social choice rule. A dictatorship, which
always chooses the dictator's most preferred alternative, is
trivially strategy-proof. The dictator obviously has no incentive to
vote strategically, and no-one else does so either, since the outcome
depends only on the dictator.</p>

<p>

To see that the Borda count violates strategy-proofness, recall the
example of Tables 3 and 4 above. If Individual 1 in Table 3 truthfully
submits the preference ordering
<em>y</em><em>P</em><sub>1</sub><em>x</em><em>P</em><sub>1</sub><em>z</em><em>P</em><sub>1</sub><em>w</em>,
the Borda winner is <em>z</em>, as we have seen. If Individual 1
falsely submits the preference ordering
<em>x</em><em>P</em><sub>1</sub><em>y</em><em>P</em><sub>1</sub><em>w</em><em>P</em><sub>1</sub><em>z</em>,
as in Table 4, the Borda winner is <em>x</em>. But Individual 1 prefers
<em>x</em> to <em>z</em> according to his or her true preference
ordering (in Table 3), and so he or she has an incentive to vote
strategically.</p>

<p>

Moulin (1980) has shown that when the domain of the social choice
rule is restricted to single-peaked preference profiles, pairwise
majority voting and other so-called &lsquo;median voting&rsquo; schemes
can satisfy the rest of the conditions of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite
theorem. Similarly, when collective decisions are restricted to binary
choices alone, which amounts to dropping the range constraint, majority
voting satisfies the rest of the conditions. Other possible escape
routes from the theorem open up if resoluteness is dropped. In the
limiting case in which all alternatives are always chosen, the other
conditions are vacuously satisfied.</p>

<p>

The requirement of strategy-proofness has been challenged too. One
line of argument is that, even when there exist strategic incentives in
the technical sense of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, individuals
will not necessarily act on them. They would require detailed
information about others' preferences and enough computational
power to figure out what the optimal strategically modified preferences
would be. Neither demand is generally met. Bartholdi, Tovey, and Trick
(1989) showed that, due to computational complexity, some social choice
rules are resistant to strategic manipulation: it may be an NP-hard
problem for a voter to determine how to vote strategically. In this vein, Harrison
and McDaniel (2008) provide experimental evidence suggesting that the
&lsquo;Kemeny rule&rsquo;, an extension of pairwise majority voting
designed to avoid Condorcet cycles, is &lsquo;behaviourally
incentive-compatible&rsquo;: i.e., strategic manipulation is
computationally hard.</p>

<p>

Dowding and van Hees (2008) have argued that not all forms of
strategic voting are normatively problematic. They distinguish between
&lsquo;sincere&rsquo; and &lsquo;insincere&rsquo; forms of manipulation
and argue that only the latter but not the former are normatively
troublesome. Sincere manipulation occurs when a voter (i) votes for a compromise
alternative whose chances of winning are thereby increased and (ii)
genuinely prefers that compromise alternative to the alternative that would
otherwise win. For example, in the 2000 US presidential election, supporters of Ralph Nader (a third-party candidate with little chance of winning) who voted for Al Gore to increase his chances of beating George W. Bush engaged in sincere manipulation in the sense of (i) and (ii). Plurality rule is susceptible to sincere manipulation, but not vulnerable to insincere manipulation.</p>

<h2><a id="WelAgg">4. Welfare aggregation</a></h2>

<p>

An implicit assumption so far has been that preferences are ordinal
and not interpersonally comparable: preference orderings contain no
information about each individual's strength of preference or
about how to compare different individuals' preferences with one
another. Statements such as &lsquo;Individual 1 prefers alternative
<em>x</em> more than Individual 2 prefers alternative <em>y</em>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;Individual l prefers a switch from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em>
more than Individual 2 prefers a switch from <em>x*</em> to
<em>y*</em>&rsquo; are considered meaningless.</p>

<p>
In voting contexts, this assumption may be plausible, but in
welfare-evaluation contexts&mdash;when a social planner seeks to rank
different social alternatives in an order of social welfare&mdash;the
use of richer information may be justified. Sen (1970b) generalized
Arrow's model to incorporate such richer information.</p>

<p>

As before, consider a set <em>N</em> = {1, 2, &hellip;, <em>n</em>}
of individuals (<em>n</em> &ge; 2) and a set <em>X</em> =
{<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>, &hellip;} of social alternatives.
Now each individual 
<span class="nw"><em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em></span> has a <em>welfare
function</em> <em>W<sub>i</sub></em> over these alternatives, which
assigns a real number <em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>) to each
alternative 
<span class="nw"><em>x</em> &isin; <em>X</em>,</span> interpreted as a measure of
<em>i</em>'s welfare under alternative <em>x</em>. Any welfare
function on <em>X</em> induces an ordering on <em>X</em>, but the
converse is not true: welfare functions encode more information. A
combination of welfare functions across the individuals,
&lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, is called a <em>profile</em>.</p>

<p>

A <em>social welfare functional</em> (<em>SWFL</em>), also denoted
<em>F</em>, is a function that assigns to each profile
&lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; (in some domain of admissible profiles)
a social preference relation <em>R</em> =
<em>F</em>(<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>) on <em>X</em>, with the familiar
interpretation. Again, when <em>F</em> is clear from the context, we
write <em>R</em> for the social preference relation corresponding to
&lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;. The <em>output</em> of a SWFL is
similar to that of a preference aggregation rule (again, we do not
build the completeness or transitivity of <em>R</em> into
the
 definition<sup>[<a href="notes.html#9" name="note-9">9</a>]</sup>),
but its
<em>input</em> is richer.</p>

<p>

What we gain from this depends on how much of the enriched
informational input we allow ourselves to use in determining
society's preferences: technically, it depends on our assumption
about measurability and interpersonal comparability of welfare.</p>

<h3><a id="MeaIntComWel">4.1 Measurability and interpersonal comparability of welfare</a></h3>

By assigning real numbers to alternatives, welfare profiles contain a lot of information over and above the profiles of orderings on <em>X</em> they induce. In particular, many different assignments of <em>numbers</em> to alternatives can give rise to the same <em>orderings</em>.  But we may not consider all this information meaningful. Some of it could be an artifact of the numerical representation. For example, the difference
between the profile &lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and
its scaled-up version &lt;10*<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>,
10*<em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, 10*<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;,
where everything is the same in proportional terms, could be like the
difference between length measurements in centimeters and in
inches. The two profiles might be seen as alternative representations of the exact same information, just on different scales.</p>

<p>

To express different assumptions about which information is truly encoded by a profile of welfare functions and which information is not (and should thus be seen, at best, as an artifact of the numerical representation), it is helpful to introduce the notion of <em>meaningful statements</em>. Some examples of statements about individual welfare that are candidates for meaningful statements are the following (List 2003b; see also Bossert and Weymark 1996: Section 5):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>A level comparison</em>: Individual <em>i'</em>s welfare
under alternative <em>x</em> is at least as great as individual
<em>j</em>'s welfare under alternative <em>y</em>, formally
<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>) &ge;
<em>W<sub>j</sub></em>(<em>y</em>). (The comparison is <em>intrapersonal</em> if <em>i</em> = <em>j</em>, and <em>interpersonal</em> if <em>i</em> &ne; <em>j</em>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>A unit comparison</em>: The ratio of [individual
<em>i</em>'s welfare gain or loss if we switch from alternative
<em>y</em><sub>1</sub> to alternative <em>x</em><sub>1</sub>] to
[individual <em>j</em>'s welfare gain or loss if we switch from
alternative <em>y</em><sub>2</sub> to alternative
<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>] is &lambda;, where
&lambda; is some real
number, formally (<em>x</em><sub>1</sub> &minus;
<em>y</em><sub>1</sub>) / (<em>x</em><sub>2</sub> &minus;
<em>y</em><sub>2</sub>) = &lambda;. (Again, the comparison is <em>intrapersonal</em> if <em>i</em> = <em>j</em>, and <em>interpersonal</em> if <em>i</em> &ne; <em>j</em>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>A zero comparison</em>: Individual <em>i</em>'s welfare
under alternative <em>x</em> is greater than / equal to / less than
zero, formally <em>sign</em>(<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>)) =
&lambda;, where 
<span class="nw">&lambda;  &isin; {&minus;1, 0, 1}</span> and <em>sign</em> is a real-valued function that maps
strictly negative numbers to &minus;1, zero to 0, and strictly positive
numbers to +1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Arrow's view, as noted, is that only intrapersonal level
comparisons are meaningful, while all other kinds of comparisons are
not. Sen (1970b) formalized various assumptions about measurability and
interpersonal comparability of welfare by (i) defining an equivalence
relation on welfare profiles that specifies when two profiles count as
&lsquo;containing the same information&rsquo;, and (ii) requiring any
profiles in the same equivalence class to generate the same social
preference ordering. Of the three kinds of comparison statements introduced above, the
meaningful ones are those that are invariant in each equivalence class.
Arrow's ordinalist assumption can be expressed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Ordinal measurability with no interpersonal comparability
(ONC)</em>: Two profiles &lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and
&lt;<em>W*</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W*</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W*<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; contain the same information whenever,
for each 
<span class="nw"><em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em>,</span>
<span class="nw"><em>W*<sub>i</sub></em> = <em>&phi;</em><sub><i>i</i></sub>(<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>),</span>
 where
<em>&phi;</em><em><sub>i</sub></em> is some positive monotonic
transformation, possibly different for different individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Thus the individual welfare functions in any profile can be
arbitrarily monotonically transformed (&lsquo;stretched or
squeezed&rsquo;) without informational loss, thereby ruling out any
interpersonal comparisons or even intrapersonal unit comparisons.</p>

<p>

If welfare is cardinally measurable but still interpersonally
non-comparable, we have:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Cardinal measurability with no interpersonal comparability
(CNC)</em>: Two profiles &lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and
&lt;<em>W*</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W*</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W*<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; contain the same information whenever,
for each <em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em>, 
<span class="nw"><em>W*<sub>i</sub></em> = <em>a<sub>i</sub>W<sub>i</sub></em> + <em>b<sub>i</sub></em>,</span> where the
<em>a<sub>i</sub></em>s and <em>b<sub>i</sub></em>s are real numbers
(with <em>a<sub>i</sub></em> &gt; 0), possibly different for
different individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Here, each individual's welfare function is unique up to
positive affine transformations (&lsquo;scaling and shifting&rsquo;),
but there is still no common scale across individuals. This renders
intrapersonal level and unit comparisons meaningful, but rules out interpersonal
comparisons and zero comparisons.</p>

<p>

Interpersonal level comparability is achieved under the following
enriched variant of ordinal measurability:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Ordinal measurability with interpersonal level comparability
(OLC)</em>: Two profiles &lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and
&lt;<em>W*</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W*</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W*<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; contain the same information whenever,
for each <em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em>, 
<span class="nw"><em>W*<sub>i</sub></em> = <em>&phi;</em>(<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>),</span> where <em>&phi;</em> is the same
positive monotonic transformation for all individuals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Here, a profile of individual welfare functions can be arbitrarily
monotonically transformed (&lsquo;stretched or squeezed&rsquo;) without
informational loss, but the same transformation must be used for all
individuals, thereby rendering interpersonal level comparisons meaningful.</p>

<p>

Interpersonal unit comparability is achieved under the following
enriched variant of cardinal measurability:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Cardinal measurability with interpersonal unit comparability
(CUC)</em>: Two profiles &lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and
&lt;<em>W*</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W*</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W*<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; contain the same information whenever,
for each <em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em>, 
<span class="nw"><em>W*<sub>i</sub></em> = <em>aW<sub>i</sub></em> + <em>b<sub>i</sub></em>,</span> where <em>a</em> is
the same real number for all individuals (<em>a</em> &gt; 0) and
the <em>b<sub>i</sub></em>s are real numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Here, the welfare functions in each profile can be re-scaled and
shifted without informational loss, but the same scalar multiple
(though not necessarily the same shifting constant) must be used for
all individuals, thereby rendering interpersonal unit comparisons
meaningful.</p>

<p>

Zero comparisons, finally, become meaningful under the following
enriched variant of ordinal measurability (List 2001):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Ordinal measurability with zero comparability (ONC+0)</em>: Two
profiles &lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and
&lt;<em>W*</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W*</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W*<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; contain the same information whenever,
for each <em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em>, <em>W*<sub>i</sub></em> =
<em>&phi;</em><em><sub>i</sub></em>(<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>), where
<em>&phi;</em><em><sub>i</sub></em> is some positive monotonic and
zero-preserving transformation, possibly different for different
individuals. (Here <em>zero-preserving</em> means that
<em>&phi;</em><em><sub>i</sub></em>(0) = 0.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

This allows arbitrary stretching and squeezing of individual welfare
functions without informational loss, <em>provided the welfare level of
zero remains fixed</em>, thereby ensuring zero comparability.</p>

<p>

Several other measurability and interpersonal comparability
assumptions have been discussed in the literature. The following
ensures the meaningfulness of interpersonal comparisons of both levels and units:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Cardinal measurability with full interpersonal comparability
(CFC)</em>: Two profiles &lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and
&lt;<em>W*</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W*</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W*<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; contain the same information whenever,
for each <em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em>, 
<span class="nw"><em>W*<sub>i</sub></em> =
<em>aW<sub>i</sub></em> + <em>b</em>,</span> where <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> are
the same real numbers for all individuals (<em>a</em> &gt; 0).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Lastly, intra- and interpersonal comparisons of all <em>three</em>
kinds (level, unit, and zero) are meaningful if we accept the
following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Ratio-scale measurability with full interpersonal comparability
(RFC)</em>: Two profiles &lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and
&lt;<em>W*</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W*</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W*<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; contain the same information whenever,
for each <em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em>, <em>W*<sub>i</sub></em> =
<em>aW<sub>i</sub></em>, where <em>a</em> is the same real number for
all individuals (<em>a</em> &gt; 0).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Which assumption is warranted depends on how welfare is interpreted.
If welfare is <em>hedonic utility</em>, which can be experienced only
from a first-person perspective, interpersonal comparisons are harder
to justify than if welfare is the <em>objective satisfaction of
subjective preferences or desires</em> (the
<em>desire-satisfaction</em> view) or an <em>objective good or
state</em> (an <em>objective-list</em> view) (e.g., Hausman 1995; List
2003b). The desire-satisfaction view may render interpersonal
comparisons empirically meaningful (by relating the interpersonally
significant maximal and minimal levels of welfare for each individual
to the attainment of his or her most and least preferred alternatives),
but at the expense of running into problems of expensive tastes or
adaptive preferences (Hausman 1995). Resource-based, functioning-based,
or primary-goods-based currencies of welfare, by contrast, may allow
empirically meaningful and less morally problematic interpersonal
comparisons. </p>

<h3><a id="PosWelAgg">4.2 The possibility of welfare aggregation</a></h3>

<p>

Once we introduce interpersonal comparisons of welfare levels or
units, or zero comparisons, there exist possible SWFLs satisfying the
analogues of Arrow's conditions as well as stronger desiderata.
In a welfare-aggregation context, Arrow's impossibility can
therefore be traced to a lack of interpersonal comparability.</p>

<p>

As noted, a SWFL respects a given assumption about measurability and
interpersonal comparability if, for any two profiles
&lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and &lt;<em>W*</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>W*</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>W*<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; that
are deemed to contain the same information, we have
<em>F</em>(<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>) = <em>F</em>(<em>W*</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>W*</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>W*<sub>n</sub></em>).
Arrow's conditions and theorem can be restated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Universal domain</em>: The domain of <em>F</em> is the set of
all logically possible profiles of individual welfare functions.</p>

<p>

<em>Ordering</em>: For any profile &lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; in the
domain of <em>F</em>, the social preference relation <em>R</em> is
complete and transitive.</p>

<p>

<em>Weak Pareto principle</em>: For any profile
&lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; in the domain of <em>F</em>, if for all
<em>i</em>&isin;<em>N</em> <em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>) &gt;
<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>y</em>), then <em>xPy</em>.</p>
<p>

<em>Independence of irrelevant alternatives</em>: For any two
profiles &lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and
&lt;<em>W*</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W*</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W*<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; in the domain of <em>F</em> and any
<em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin; <em>X</em>, if for all <em>i</em>
&isin; <em>N W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>) =
<em>W*<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>) and
<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>y</em>) =
<em>W*<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>y</em>), then <em>xRy</em> if and only if
<em>xR*y</em>.</p>

<p>

<em>Non-dictatorship</em>: There does not exist an individual
<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> such that, for all
&lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; in the domain of <em>F</em> and all
<em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin; <em>X</em>,
<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>) &gt;
<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>y</em>) implies <em>xPy</em>.</p>

<p>

<em>Theorem</em>: Under ONC (or CNC, as Sen 1970b has shown), if
<span class="nw">|<em>X</em>| &gt; 2,</span> there exists no SWFL satisfying universal domain,
ordering, the weak Pareto principle, independence of irrelevant
alternatives, and non-dictatorship.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Crucially, however, each of OLC, CUC, and ONC+0 is sufficient for
the existence of SWFLs satisfying all other conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Theorem</em> (combining several results from the literature, as illustrated below): Under each of OLC, CUC, and ONC+0, there exist
SWFLs satisfying universal domain, ordering, the weak Pareto principle,
independence of irrelevant alternatives, and non-dictatorship (as well
as stronger conditions).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>

Some examples of such SWFLs come from political philosophy and
welfare economics. A possible SWFL under OLC is a version of
Rawls's difference principle (1971).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Maximin</em>: For any profile &lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and
any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin; <em>X</em>, <em>xRy</em> if and only
if <span class="nw"><em>min<sub>i</sub></em><sub>&isin;</sub><sub><em>N</em></sub>(<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>))</span> &ge;
<span class="nw"><em>min<sub>i</sub></em><sub>&isin;</sub><sub><em>N</em></sub>(<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>y</em>)).</span></p>

</blockquote>

<p>

While maximin rank-orders social alternatives in terms of the
welfare level of the worst-off individual alone, its lexicographic
extension (<em>leximin</em>), which was endorsed by Rawls himself, uses
the welfare level of the second-worst-off individual as a tie-breaker
when there is tie at the level of the worst off, the welfare level of
the third-worst-off individual as a tie-breaker when there is a tie at
the second stage, and so on. (Note, however, that Rawls focused on
primary goods, rather than welfare, as the relevant
&lsquo;currency&rsquo;.) This satisfies the <em>strong</em> (not just
weak) <em>Pareto principle</em>, requiring that if for all
<em>i</em>&isin;<em>N</em> <em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>) &ge;
<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>y</em>), then <em>xRy</em>, and if in
addition for some 
<span class="nw"><em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em></span>
<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>) &gt;
<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>y</em>), then <em>xPy.</em></p>

<p>

An example of a possible SWFL under CUC is classical
utilitarianism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Utilitarianism</em>: For any profile
&lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and any 
<span class="nw"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>,</span> <em>xRy</em> if and only if
<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>x</em>) + <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>x</em>)
+ &hellip; + <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>(<em>x</em>) &ge;
<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>y</em>) + <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>y</em>)
+ &hellip; + <em>W<sub>n</sub></em>(<em>y</em>).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

Finally, an example of a possible SWFL under ONC+0 is a variant of a
frequently used, though rather simplistic poverty measure.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

<em>A head-count rule</em>: For any profile
&lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>, <em>xRy</em> if and only if 
<span class="nw">|{<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> : <em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>) &lt; 0}|</span>
&lt; <span class="nw">|{<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> : <em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>y</em>) &lt; 0}|</span> or
<span class="nw">[|{<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> : <em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>)
&lt; 0}|</span> = <span class="nw">|{<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> :
<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>y</em>) &lt; 0}|</span> and
<em>xR<sub>j</sub>y</em>], where <span class="nw"><em>j</em> &isin; <em>N</em></span> is some
antecedently fixed tie-breaking individual.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

While substantively less compelling than maximin or utilitarian
rules, head-count rules require only zero-comparability of welfare
(List 2001). </p>

<p>

An important conclusion, therefore, is that Rawls's difference
principle, the classical utilitarian principle, and even the head-count
method of poverty measurement can all be seen as solutions to
Arrow's aggregation problem that become possible once we go
beyond Arrow's framework of ordinal, interpersonally
non-comparable preferences.</p>

<p>

Under CFC, one can provide a simultaneous characterization of
Rawlsian maximin and utilitarianism (Deschamps and Gevers 1978). It
uses two additional axioms. One, <em>minimal equity</em>, requires (in
the words of Sen 1977: 1548) &lsquo;that a person who is going to be
best off anyway does not <em>always</em> strictly have his way&rsquo;,
and another, <em>separability</em>, requires that two welfare profiles
that coincide for some subset <em>M</em> &sube; <em>N</em> while
everyone in <em>N</em>\<em>M</em> is indifferent between all
alternatives in <em>X</em> lead to the same social ordering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Theorem</em> (Deschamps and Gevers 1978): Under CFC, any SWFL
satisfying universal domain, ordering, the strong Pareto principle,
independence of irrelevant alternatives, anonymity (as in May's
theorem), minimal equity, and separability is either leximin or of a
utilitarian type (meaning that, except possibly when there are ties in
sum-total welfare, it coincides with the utilitarian SWFL defined
above).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Finally, the additional information available under RFC makes
&lsquo;prioritarian&rsquo; SWFLs
 possible.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#10" name="note-10">10</a>]</sup>
Like utilitarian SWFLs, they rank-order social
alternatives on the basis of welfare sums across the individuals in
<em>N</em>, but rather than summing up welfare directly, they sum up
concavely transformed welfare, giving greater marginal weight to lower
levels of welfare.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Prioritarianism</em>: For any profile
&lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and any 
<span class="nw"><em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>,</span> <em>xRy</em> if and only if
<em>W</em><sub>1</sub><em><sup>r</sup></em>(<em>x</em>) +
<em>W</em><sub>2</sub><em><sup>r</sup></em>(<em>x</em>) + &hellip; +
<em>W<sub>n</sub> <sup>r</sup></em>(<em>x</em>) &ge;
<em>W</em><sub>1</sub><em><sup>r</sup></em>(<em>y</em>) +
<em>W</em><sub>2</sub><em><sup>r</sup></em>(<em>y</em>) + &hellip; +
<em>W<sub>n</sub> <sup>r</sup></em>(<em>y</em>), where 0 &lt;
<em>r</em> &lt; 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Prioritarianism requires RFC and not merely CFC because, by design,
the prioritarian social ordering for any welfare profile is not
invariant under changes in welfare levels (shifting).</p>

<h3><a id="OthTopWelAgg">4.3 Other topics</a></h3>

<p>

The present welfare-aggregation framework has been applied to several further areas. It
has been generalized to variable-population choice problems, so as
to formalize population ethics in the tradition of Parfit (1984). Here,
we must rank-order social alternatives (e.g., possible worlds) in which
different individuals exist. Let <em>N</em>(<em>x</em>) denote the set of individuals existing under alternative <em>x</em>. For example, the set <em>N</em>(<em>x</em>) could differ from the set <em>N</em>(<em>y</em>), when <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are distinct alternatives (this generalizes our previous assumption of a fixed set <em>N</em>). The variable-population case raises questions such as whether a world
with a smaller number of better-off individuals is better than, equally
good as, or worse than a world with a larger number of worse-off
individuals. (The focus here is on axiological questions about the
relative goodness of such worlds, not normative questions about the
rightness or wrongness of bringing them about.)</p>

<p>

Parfit (1984) and others argued that classical utilitarianism is
subject to the <em>repugnant conclusion</em>: a world with a very large
number of individuals whose welfare levels are barely above zero could
have a larger sum-total of welfare, and therefore count as better, than
a world with a smaller number of very well-off individuals.</p>

<p>

Blackorby, Donaldson, and Bossert (e.g., 2005) have axiomatically
characterized different variable-population welfare aggregation
methods that avoid the repugnant conclusion and satisfy some other
desiderata. One solution is the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>

<em>Critical-level utilitarianism</em>: For any profile
&lt;<em>W</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>W<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and any <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>, <em>xRy</em> if and only if
&Sigma;<sub><i>i</i>&isin;<i>N</i>(<i>x</i>)</sub>[<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>x</em>)
&minus; <em>c</em>] &ge;
&Sigma;<sub><i>i</i>&isin;<i>N</i>(<i>y</i>)</sub>[<em>W<sub>i</sub></em>(<em>y</em>)
&minus; <em>c</em>], where <em>c</em> &ge; 0 is some &lsquo;critical
level&rsquo; of welfare above which the quality of life counts as
&lsquo;decent/good&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Critical-level utilitarianism avoids the repugnant conclusion when
the parameter <em>c</em> is set sufficiently large. It requires
stronger measurability of welfare than classical utilitarianism, since
it generates a social ordering <em>R</em> that is not generally
invariant under re-scaling of welfare units or shifts in welfare
levels. Even the rich framework of RFC would force the critical level
<em>c</em> to be zero, thereby collapsing critical-level utilitarianism
into classical utilitarianism and making it vulnerable to the repugnant
conclusion again. As Blackorby, Bossert, and Donaldson (1999: 420)
note, </p>

<blockquote><p>
[s]ome information environments that are ethically
adequate in fixed-population settings have ethically unattractive
consequences in variable-population environments.</p></blockquote>

<p>
Thus, in the
variable-population case, a more significant departure from the
limited informational framework of Arrow's original model is needed to
avoid impossibility results.</p>

<p>

The SWFL approach has been generalized to the case in which each
individual has multiple welfare functions (e.g., a <em>k</em>-tuple of
them), capturing (i) multiple opinions about each individual's
welfare (e.g., Roberts 1995; Ooghe and Lauwers 2005) or (ii) multiple
dimensions of welfare (e.g., List 2004a). In this case, we are faced
not only with issues of measurability and interpersonal comparability,
but also with issues of inter-opinion or inter-dimensional
comparability. To obtain compelling possibility results, comparability
across both individuals and dimensions/opinions is needed. A related
literature addresses multidimensional inequality measurement (for an
introductory review, see Weymark 2006).</p>

<p>

Finally, in the philosophy of biology, the one-dimensional and
multi-dimensional SWFL frameworks have been used (by Okasha 2009 and
Bossert, Qi, and Weymark 2013) to analyse the notion of group fitness,
defined as a function of individual fitness indicators.</p>

<h2><a id="JudAgg">5. Judgment aggregation</a></h2>
<p>

A more recent branch of social choice theory is the theory of
judgment aggregation. It can be motivated by observing that votes, orderings, or welfare functions over multiple alternatives are not the only objects we may wish to aggregate from an individual to a collective level. Many decision-making bodies,
such as legislatures, collegial courts, expert panels, and other
committees, are faced with more complex &lsquo;aggreganda&rsquo;. In
particular, they may have to aggregate individual sets of judgments on
multiple, logically connected propositions into collective sets of
judgments.</p>

<p>

A court may have to judge whether a defendant is liable for breach
of contract on the basis of whether there was a valid contract in place
and whether there was a breach. An expert panel may have to judge
whether atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations will exceed a
particular threshold by 2050, whether there is a causal chain from
greater greenhouse-gas concentrations to temperature increases, and
whether the temperature will increase. Legislators may have to judge
whether a particular end is socially desirable, whether a proposed
policy is the best means for achieving that end, and whether to pursue
that policy.</p>

<p>

These problems cannot be formalized in standard
preference-aggregation models, since the aggreganda are not orderings
but sets of judgments on multiple propositions. The theory of judgment
aggregation represents these aggreganda in propositional logic (or
another suitable logic). The field was inspired by the &lsquo;doctrinal
paradox&rsquo; in jurisprudence, with which we begin.</p>

<h3><a id="DocParDisDil">5.1 The &lsquo;doctrinal paradox&rsquo; and the &lsquo;discursive dilemma&rsquo;</a></h3>

<p>

Kornhauser and Sager (1986) described the following problem. (A
structurally similar problem was discovered by Vacca 1921 and, as
Elster 2013 points out, by Poisson 1837.) A three-judge court has to
make judgments on the following propositions:</p>

<ul>

<li><em>p</em>: The defendant was contractually obliged not to do action
<i>X</i>.</li>
<li><em>q</em>: The defendant did action <i>X</i>.</li>
<li><em>r</em>: The defendant is liable for breach of contract.</li>
</ul>

<p>

According to legal doctrine, the <em>premises</em> <em>p</em> and
<em>q</em> are jointly necessary and sufficient for the
<em>conclusion</em> <em>r</em>. Suppose the individual judges hold the
views shown in Table 5.</p>

<p>

Although each individual judge respects the relevant legal doctrine,
there is a majority for <em>p</em>, a majority for <em>q</em>, and yet
a majority against <em>r</em>&mdash;in breach of legal doctrine. The
court faces a dilemma: it can <em>either</em> go with the majority
judgments on the premises (<em>p</em> and <em>q</em>) and reach a
&lsquo;liable&rsquo; verdict by logical inference (the
<em>issue-by-issue</em> or <em>premise-based approach</em>);
<em>or</em> go with the majority judgment on the conclusion
(<em>r</em>) and reach a &lsquo;not liable&rsquo; verdict, ignoring the
majority judgments on the premises (the <em>case-by-case</em> or
<em>conclusion-based approach</em>). Kornhauser and Sager's
&lsquo;doctrinal paradox&rsquo; consists in the fact that these two
approaches may lead to opposite outcomes.</p>

<p>

We can learn another lesson from this example. Relative to the legal
doctrine, the majority judgments are logically inconsistent. Formally
expressed, the set of majority-accepted propositions, {<em>p</em>,
<em>q</em>, <em>not r</em>}, is inconsistent relative to the constraint
<em>r</em> <em>if and only if</em> (<em>p</em> <em>and</em>
<em>q</em>). This observation was the starting point of the more
recent, formal-logic-based literature on judgment aggregation (beginning with a model and impossibility result in List and Pettit 2002).</p>

<p>

The possibility of inconsistent majority judgments is not tied to
the presence of a legal doctrine or other explicit side constraint (as
pointed out by Pettit 2001, who called this phenomenon the
&lsquo;discursive dilemma&rsquo;). Suppose, for example, an expert
panel has to make judgments on three propositions (and their
negations):</p>

<ul>
<li>
<em>p</em>: Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> will exceed 600ppm by
2050.</li>
<li>
<em>if</em> <em>p then q</em>: If atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> exceeds
this level by 2050, there will be a   temperature increase of more than
3.5&deg; by 2010.</li>
<li>
<em>q</em>: There will be a temperature increase of more than
3.5&deg; by 2010.</li>
</ul>

<p>

If individual judgments are as shown in Table 6, the majority
judgments are inconsistent: despite individually consistent judgments,
the set of majority-accepted propositions, {<em>p</em>, <em>if p then
q</em>, <em>not</em> <em>q</em>}, is logically inconsistent.</p>

<h3><a id="ConForIncMajJud">5.2 The conditions for inconsistent majority judgments</a></h3>

<p>

The patterns of judgments in Tables 5 and 6 are structurally
equivalent to the pattern of preferences leading to Condorcet's
paradox, when we reinterpret those preferences as judgments on
propositions of the form &lsquo;<em>x</em> is preferable to
<em>y</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>y</em> is preferable to
<em>z</em>&rsquo;, and so on, as shown in Table 7 (List and Pettit
2004; an earlier interpretation of preferences along these lines can be
found in Guilbaud [1952] 1966). Here, the set of majority-accepted
propositions is inconsistent relative to the constraint of
transitivity.</p>

<p>

A general combinatorial result subsumes all these phenomena. Call a
set of propositions <em>minimally inconsistent</em> if it is a
logically inconsistent set, but all its proper subsets are
consistent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Proposition</em> (Dietrich and List 2007a; Nehring and Puppe
2007): Propositionwise majority voting may generate inconsistent
collective judgments if and only if the set of propositions (and their
negations) on which judgments are to be made has a minimally
inconsistent subset of three or more propositions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

In the examples of Tables 6, 5, and 7, the relevant minimally
inconsistent sets of size (at least) three are: {<em>p</em>, <em>if p
then q</em>, <em>not q</em>}, which is minimally inconsistent <em>simpliciter</em>; {<em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, <em>not r</em>},
which is minimally inconsistent relative to the side constraint <em>r
if and only if</em> (<em>p and q</em>); and {&lsquo;<em>x</em> is
preferable to <em>y</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>y</em> is preferable to
<em>z</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>z</em> is preferable to
<em>x</em>&rsquo;}, which is minimally inconsistent relative to a
transitivity constraint on preferability.</p>

<h3><a id="GenModSimImpRes">5.3 A general model and a simple impossibility result</a></h3>

<p>

The basic model of judgment aggregation can be defined as follows
(List and Pettit 2002). Let <em>N</em> = {1, 2, &hellip;, <em>n</em>}
be a set of individuals (<em>n</em> &ge; 2). The propositions on
which judgments are to be made are represented by sentences from
propositional logic (or some other, expressively richer logic, such as
a predicate, modal, or conditional logic; see Dietrich 2007). We define
the <em>agenda</em>, <em>X</em>, as a finite set of propositions,
closed under single
 negation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#11" name="note-11">11</a>]</sup>
For example, <em>X</em> could be {<em>p</em>,
&not;<em>p</em>, <em>p</em>&rarr;<em>q</em>,
&not;(<em>p</em>&rarr;<em>q</em>), <em>q</em>, &not;<em>q</em>},
as in the expert-panel case.</p>

<p>

Each individual <em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> has a <em>judgment
set</em> <em>J<sub>i</sub></em>, defined as a subset
<em>J<sub>i</sub></em> &sube; <em>X</em> and interpreted as the set
of propositions that individual <em>i</em> accepts. A judgment set is
<em>consistent</em> if it is a logically consistent set
of
 propositions<sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup>
and
<em>complete</em> (relative to <em>X</em>) if it contains a member of
every proposition-negation pair <em>p</em>, &not;<em>p</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>.</p>
<p>

A combination of judgment sets across the individuals,
&lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, is called a <em>profile</em>. A
<em>judgment aggregation rule</em>, <em>F</em>, is a function that
assigns to each profile &lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; (in
some domain of admissible profiles) a collective judgment set
<em>J</em> = <em>F</em>(<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>J<sub>n</sub></em>) &sube; <em>X</em>, interpreted as
the set of propositions accepted by the group as a whole. As before,
when <em>F</em> is clear from the context, we write <em>J</em> for the
collective judgment set corresponding to
&lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;. Again, for generality, we build no
rationality requirement on <em>J</em> (such as consistency or
completeness) into the definition of a judgment aggregation rule.</p>

<p>

The simplest example of a judgment aggregation rule is
<em>propositionwise majority voting</em>. Here, for any profile
&lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, <em>J</em> = {<em>p</em> &isin;
<em>X</em> : |{<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> : <em>p</em> &isin;
<em>J<sub>i</sub></em>}| &gt; <em>n</em>/2}. As we have seen, this
may produce inconsistent collective judgments.</p>

<p>

Consider the following conditions on an aggregation rule:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Universal domain</em>: The domain of <em>F</em> is the set of
all logically possible profiles of consistent and complete individual
judgment sets.</p>

<p>

<em>Collective rationality</em>: For any profile
&lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; in the domain of <em>F</em>, the
collective judgment set <em>J</em> is consistent and complete.</p>

<p>

<em>Anonymity</em>: For any two profiles
&lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and
<span class="nw">&lt;<em>J</em><span class="supsub">*<span class="lower">1</span></span>,</span>
<span class="nw"><em>J</em><span class="supsub">*<span class="lower">2</span></span>,</span> &hellip;,
<span class="nw"><em>J</em><span class="supsub">*<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span>&gt;</span> that are permutations of
each other, <em>F</em>(<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>J<sub>n</sub></em>) =
<span class="nw"><em>F</em>(<em>J</em><span class="supsub">*<span class="lower">1</span></span>,</span>
<span class="nw"><em>J</em><span class="supsub">*<span class="lower">1</span></span>,</span> &hellip;,
<span class="nw"><em>J</em><span class="supsub">*<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span>).</span></p>
<p>

<em>Systematicity</em>: For any two profiles
&lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; and 
<span class="nw">&lt;<em>J</em><span class="supsub">*<span class="lower">1</span></span>,</span>
<span class="nw"><em>J</em><span class="supsub">*<span class="lower">2</span></span>,</span> &hellip;,
<span class="nw"><em>J</em><span class="supsub">*<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span>&gt;</span>
in
the domain of <em>F</em> and any <em>p</em>, <em>q</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>, if for all <em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> <em>p</em> &isin;
<em>J<sub>i</sub></em> if and only if <em>q</em> &isin;
<span class="nw"><em>J</em><span class="supsub">*<span class="lower"><i>i</i></span></span>,</span> then <em>p</em> &isin; <em>J</em>
if and only if <em>q</em> &isin; <em>J<sup>*</sup></em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

The first three conditions are analogous to universal domain,
ordering, and anonymity in preference aggregation. The last is the
counterpart of independence of irrelevant alternatives, though
stronger: it requires that (i) the collective judgment on any
proposition <em>p</em> &isin; <em>X</em> (of which a binary ranking
proposition such as &lsquo;<em>x</em> is preferable to
<em>y</em>&rsquo; is a special case) depend only on individual
propositions on <em>p</em> (the <em>independence</em> part), and (ii)
the pattern of dependence between individual and collective judgments
be the same across all propositions in <em>X</em> (the
<em>neutrality</em> part). Formally, <em>independence</em> is the
special case with quantification restricted to <em>p</em> = <em>q</em>.
Propositionwise majority voting satisfies all these conditions, except
the consistency part of collective rationality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Theorem</em> (List and Pettit 2002): If {<em>p</em>, <em>q</em>,
<em>p</em>&and;<em>q</em>} &sube; <em>X</em> (where <em>p</em> and
<em>q</em> are mutually independent propositions and
&lsquo;&and;&rsquo; can also be replaced by &lsquo;&or;&rsquo;
or &lsquo;&rarr;&rsquo;), there exists no judgment aggregation rule
satisfying universal domain, collective rationality, anonymity, and
systematicity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Like other impossibility theorems, this result is best interpreted
as describing the trade-offs between different conditions on an
aggregation rule. The result has been generalized and strengthened in
various ways, beginning with Pauly and van Hees's (2006) proof
that the impossibility persists if anonymity is weakened to
non-dictatorship (for other generalizations, see Dietrich 2006 and
Mongin 2008).</p>

<h3><a id="GenImpPosThe">5.4 More general impossibility and possibility theorems</a></h3>
<p>

As we have seen, in preference aggregation, the
&lsquo;boundary&rsquo; between possibility and impossibility results is
easy to draw: when there are only two decision alternatives, all of the
desiderata on a preference aggregation rule reviewed above can be
satisfied (and majority rule does the job); when there are three or
more alternatives, there are impossibility results. In judgment
aggregation, by contrast, the picture is more complicated. What matters
is not the number of propositions in <em>X</em> but the nature of the
logical interconnections between them.</p>

<p>

Impossibility results in judgment aggregation have the following
generic form: for a given class of agendas, the aggregation rules
satisfying a particular set of conditions (usually, a domain condition,
a rationality condition, and some responsiveness conditions) are
non-existent or degenerate (e.g., dictatorial). Different kinds of
agendas trigger different instances of this scheme, with stronger or
weaker conditions imposed on the aggregation rule depending on the
properties of those agendas (for a more detailed review, see List
2012). The significance of combinatorial properties of the agenda was
first discovered by Nehring and Puppe (2002) in a mathematically
related but interpretationally distinct framework (strategy-proof
social choice over so-called property spaces). Three kinds of agenda
stand out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>A non-simple agenda</em>: <em>X</em> has a minimally
inconsistent subset of three or more propositions.</p>

<p>

<em>A pair-negatable agenda</em>: <em>X</em> has a minimally
inconsistent subset <em>Y</em> that can be rendered consistent by
negating a pair of propositions in it. (Equivalently, <em>X</em> is not
isomorphic to a set of propositions whose only connectives are &not;
and &harr;; see Dokow and Holzman 2010a.)</p>

<p>

<em>A path-connected agenda</em> (or <em>totally blocked</em>, in
Nehring and Puppe 2002): For any <em>p</em>, <em>q</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>, there is a sequence <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>p</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>p<sub>k</sub></em> &isin;
<em>X</em> with <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>p</em> and
<em>p<sub>k</sub></em> = <em>q</em> such that <em>p</em><sub>1</sub>
conditionally entails <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>p</em><sub>2</sub>
conditionally entails <em>p</em><sub>3</sub>, &hellip;, and
<em>p<sub>k</sub></em><sub>&minus;1</sub> conditionally entails
<em>p<sub>k</sub></em>. (Here, <em>p<sub>i</sub></em> <em>conditionally
entails</em> <em>p<sub>j</sub></em> if <em>p<sub>i</sub></em>
&cup; <em>Y</em> entails <em>p<sub>j</sub></em> for some <em>Y</em>
&sube; <em>X</em> consistent with each of <em>p<sub>i</sub></em> and
&not;<em>p<sub>j</sub></em>.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>

Some agendas have two or more of these properties. The agendas in
our &lsquo;doctrinal paradox&rsquo; and &lsquo;discursive
dilemma&rsquo; examples are both non-simple and pair-negatable. The
<em>preference agenda</em>, <em>X</em> = {&lsquo;<em>x</em> is
preferable to <em>y</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>y</em> is preferable to
<em>x</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>x</em> is preferable to
<em>z</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<em>z</em> is preferable to
<em>x</em>&rsquo;, &hellip;}, is non-simple, pair-negatable, and
path-connected (assuming preferability is transitive and complete). The
following result holds:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

<em>Theorem</em> (Dietrich and List 2007b; Dokow and Holzman 2010a;
building on Nehring and Puppe 2002): If <em>X</em> is non-simple,
pair-negatable, and path-connected, there exists no judgment
aggregation rule satisfying universal domain, collective rationality,
independence, unanimity preservation (requiring that, for any unanimous
profile &lt;<em>J</em>, <em>J</em>, &hellip;, <em>J</em>&gt;,
<em>F</em>(<em>J</em>, <em>J</em>, &hellip;, <em>J</em>) = <em>J</em>),
and
 non-dictatorship.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>

Applied to the preference agenda, this result yields Arrow's
theorem (for strict preference orderings) as a corollary (predecessors
of this result can be found in List and Pettit 2004 and
Nehring
 2003).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#14" name="note-14">14</a>]</sup>
Thus Arrovian
preference aggregation can be reinterpreted as a special case of
judgment aggregation.</p>

<p>

The literature contains several variants of this theorem. One
variant drops the agenda property of path-connectedness and strengthens
independence to systematicity. A second variant drops the agenda
property of pair-negatability and imposes a monotonicity condition on
the aggregation rule (requiring that additional support never hurt an
accepted proposition) (Nehring and Puppe 2010; the latter result was
first proved in the above-mentioned mathematically related framework by
Nehring and Puppe 2002). A final variant drops both path-connectedness
and pair-negatability while imposing both systematicity and
monotonicity (<em>ibid.</em>).</p>

<p>

In each case, the agenda properties are not only sufficient but also (if <em>n</em> &ge; 3) necessary for the result (Nehring and Puppe 2002, 2010; Dokow and
Holzman 2010a). Note also that path-connectedness implies
non-simplicity. Therefore, non-simplicity need not be listed among the
theorem's conditions, though it is needed in the variants
dropping path-connectedness.</p>

<h3><a id="NonDicJudAggRul">5.5 Non-dictatorial judgment aggregation rules</a></h3>

<h4>5.5.1 Relaxing universal domain</h4>

<p>

As in preference aggregation, one way to avoid the present
impossibility results is to relax universal domain. If the domain of
admissible profiles of individual judgment sets is restricted to those
satisfying specific &lsquo;cohesion&rsquo; conditions, propositionwise
majority voting produces consistent collective judgments.</p>

<p>

The simplest cohesion condition is <em>unidimensional alignment</em>
(List 2003c). A profile &lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; is
<em>unidimensionally aligned</em> if the individuals in <em>N</em> can
be ordered from left to right (e.g., on some cognitive or ideological
dimension) such that, for every proposition <em>p</em> &isin;
<em>X</em>, the individuals accepting <em>p</em> (i.e., those with
<em>p</em> &isin; <em>J<sub>i</sub></em>) are either all to the left,
or all to the right, of those rejecting <em>p</em> (i.e., those with
<em>p</em> &notin; <em>J<sub>i</sub></em>), as illustrated in Table 8.
For any such profile, the majority judgments are consistent: the
judgment set of the median individual relative to the left-right
ordering will prevail (where <em>n</em> is odd). This judgment set will
inherit its consistency from the median individual, assuming individual
judgments are consistent. By implication, on unidimensionally aligned
domains, propositionwise majority voting will satisfy the rest of the
conditions on judgment aggregation rules reviewed above.</p>

<blockquote>
Table 8: Unidimensional alignment
<table class="inner-rules cell-center cellpad-small-dense">
<tr>
<td></td>

<th><em>Individual 2</em></th>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

In analogy with the case of single-peakedness in preference
aggregation, several less restrictive conditions already suffice for
consistent majority judgments. One such condition (introduced in
Dietrich and List 2010a, where a survey is provided) generalizes
Sen's triple-wise value-restriction. A profile
&lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; is <em>value-restricted</em> if every
minimally inconsistent subset <em>Y</em> &sube; <em>X</em> has a pair
of elements <em>p</em>, <em>q</em> such that no individual <em>i</em>
&isin; <em>N</em> has {<em>p</em>, <em>q</em>} &sube;
<em>J<sub>i</sub></em>. Value-restriction prevents any minimally
inconsistent subset of <em>X</em> from becoming majority-accepted, and
hence ensures consistent majority judgments. Applied to the preference
agenda, value-restriction reduces to Sen's equally named
condition.</p>

<h4>5.5.2 Relaxing collective rationality</h4>

<p>

While the requirement that collective judgments be consistent is
widely accepted, the requirement that collective judgments be complete
(in <em>X</em>) is more contentious. In support of completeness, one
might say that a given proposition would not be included in <em>X</em>
unless it is supposed to be collectively adjudicated. Against
completeness, one might say that there are circumstances in which the
level of disagreement on a particular proposition (or set of
propositions) is so great that forming a collective view on it is
undesirable or counterproductive. Several papers offer possibility or
impossibility results on completeness relaxations (e.g., List and
Pettit 2002; G&auml;rdenfors 2006; Dietrich and List 2007a, 2008; Dokow
and Holzman 2010b).</p>

<p>

Judgment aggregation rules violating collective completeness while
satisfying (all or most of) the other conditions introduced above
include: <em>unanimity rule</em>, where, for any profile
&lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, <em>J</em> = {<em>p</em> &isin;
<em>X</em> : <em>p</em> &isin; <em>J<sub>i</sub></em> for all
<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em>}; <em>supermajority rules</em>, where,
for any profile &lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, <em>J</em> = {<em>p</em>
&isin; <em>X</em> : |{<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> : <em>p</em>
&isin; <em>J<sub>i</sub></em>}| &gt; <em>qn</em>} for a suitable
acceptance quota <em>q</em> &isin; (0.5,1); and <em>conclusion-based
rules</em>, where a subset <em>Y</em> &sube; <em>X</em> of logically
independent propositions (and their negations) is designated as a set
of conclusions and <em>J</em> = {<em>p</em> &isin; <em>Y</em> : |{<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> : <em>p</em> &isin;
<em>J<sub>i</sub></em>}| &gt; <em>n</em>/2}. In the multi-member
court example of Table 5, the set of conclusions is simply <em>Y</em> =
{<em>r</em>, &not;<em>r</em>}.</p>

<p>

Given consistent individual judgment sets, unanimity rule guarantees
consistent collective judgment sets, because the intersection of
several consistent sets of propositions is always consistent.
Supermajority rules guarantee consistent collective judgment sets too,
provided the quota <em>q</em> is chosen to be at least
(<em>k</em>&minus;1)/<em>k</em>, where <em>k</em> is the size of the largest
minimally inconsistent subset of <em>X</em>. The reason is
combinatorial: any <em>k</em> distinct supermajorities of the relevant
size will always have at least one individual in common. So, for any
minimally inconsistent set of propositions (which is at most of size
<em>k</em>) to be majority-accepted, at least one individual would have
to accept all the propositions in the set, contradicting this
individual's consistency (Dietrich and List 2007a; List and
Pettit 2002). Conclusion-based rules, finally, produce consistent
collective judgment sets by construction, but always leave
non-conclusions undecided.</p>

<p>

G&auml;rdenfors (2006) and more generally Dietrich and List (2008)
and Dokow and Holzman (2010b) have shown that if&mdash;while relaxing
completeness&mdash;we require collective judgment sets to be
<em>deductively closed</em> (i.e., for any <em>p</em> &isin;
<em>X</em> entailed by <em>J</em>, it must be that <em>p</em> &isin;
<em>J</em>), we face an impossibility result again. For the same
agendas that lead to the impossibility result reviewed in 
<a href="#GenImpPosThe">Section 5.4,</a>
there exists no judgment aggregation rule satisfying universal domain,
collective consistency and deductive closure, independence, unanimity
preservation, and non-oligarchy. An aggregation rule is called
<em>oligarchic</em> if there is an antecedently fixed subset <em>M</em>
&sube; <em>N</em> (the &lsquo;oligarchs&rsquo;) such that, for any
profile &lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, <em>J</em> = {<em>p</em>
&isin; <em>X</em> : <em>p</em> &isin; <em>J<sub>i</sub></em> for all
<em>i</em> &isin; <em>M</em>}. Unanimity rule and dictatorships are
special cases with <em>M</em> = <em>N</em> and <em>M</em> =
{<em>i</em>} for some <em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em>, respectively.</p>

<p>

The downside of oligarchic aggregation rules is that they either
lapse into dictatorship or lead to stalemate, with the slightest
disagreements between oligarchs resulting in indecision (since every
oligarch has veto power on every proposition).</p>

<h4>5.5.3 Relaxing systematicity/independence</h4>
<p>

A variety of judgment aggregation rules become possible when we
relax systematicity/independence. Recall that systematicity combines an
independence and a neutrality requirement. Relaxing only neutrality
does not get us very far, since for many agendas there are
impossibility results with independence alone, as illustrated in
<a href="#GenImpPosThe">Section 5.4.</a></p>

<p>

One much-discussed class of aggregation rules violating independence
is given by the <em>premise-based rules</em>. Here, a subset <em>Y</em>
&sube; <em>X</em> of logically independent propositions (and their
negations) is designated as a set of <em>premises</em>, as in the court
example. For any profile &lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, <em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;,
<em>J</em> = {<em>p</em> &isin; <em>X</em> : <em>J<sub>Y</sub></em>
entails <em>p</em>} where <em>J<sub>Y</sub></em> are the
majority-accepted propositions among the premises, formally {<em>p</em>
&isin; <em>Y</em> : |{<em>i</em> &isin; <em>N</em> : <em>p</em>
&isin; <em>J<sub>i</sub></em>}| &gt; <em>n</em>/2}. Informally,
majority votes are taken on the premises, and the collective judgments
on all other propositions are determined by logical implication. If the
premises constitute a logical basis for the entire agenda, a
premise-based rule guarantees consistent and (absent ties) complete
collective judgment sets. (The present definition follows List and
Pettit 2002; for generalizations, see Dietrich and Mongin 2010. The
procedural and epistemic properties of premise-based rules are
discussed in Pettit 2001; Chapman 2002; Bovens and Rabinowicz 2006;
Dietrich 2006; List 2006.)</p>

<p>

A generalization is given by the <em>sequential priority rules</em>
(List 2004b; Dietrich and List 2007a). Here, for each profile
&lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,
<em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt;, the propositions in <em>X</em> are
collectively adjudicated in a fixed order of priority, for instance, a
temporal or epistemic one. The collective judgment on each proposition
<em>p</em> &isin; <em>X</em> is made as follows. If the majority
judgment on <em>p</em> is consistent with collective judgments on prior
propositions, this majority judgment prevails; otherwise the collective
judgment on <em>p</em> is determined by the implications of prior
judgments. By construction, this guarantees consistent and (absent
ties) complete collective judgments. However, it is
<em>path-dependent</em>: the order in which propositions are considered
may affect the outcome, specifically when the underlying majority
judgments are inconsistent. For example, when this aggregation rule is
applied to the profiles in Tables 5, 6, and 7 (but not 8), the
collective judgments depend on the order in which the propositions are
considered. Thus sequential priority rules are vulnerable to <em>agenda
manipulation</em>. Similar phenomena occur in sequential pairwise
majority voting in preference aggregation (e.g., Riker 1982).</p>

<p>

Another prominent class of aggregation rules violating independence
is given by the <em>distance-based rules</em> (Pigozzi 2006, building
on Konieczny and Pino P&eacute;rez 2002; see also Miller and Osherson
2009). A distance-based rule is defined in terms of some distance
metric between judgment sets, for example the <em>Hamming
distance</em>, where, for any two judgment sets <em>J</em>,
<em>J&prime;</em> &sube; <em>X</em>, <em>d</em>(<em>J</em>,
<em>J&prime;</em>) = |{<em>p</em> &isin; <em>X</em> : not [<em>p</em>
&isin; <em>J</em> &hArr; <em>p</em> &isin; <em>J&prime;</em>]}|.
Each profile &lt;<em>J</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>J</em><sub>2</sub>,
&hellip;, <em>J<sub>n</sub></em>&gt; is mapped to a consistent and
complete judgment set <em>J</em> that minimizes the sum-total distance
from each of the <em>J<sub>i</sub></em>s. Distance-based rules can be
interpreted as capturing the idea of identifying compromise judgments.
Unlike premise-based or sequential priority rules, they do not require
a distinction between premises and conclusions or any other order of
priority among the propositions.</p>

<p>

As in preference aggregation, the cost of relaxing independence is
the loss of strategy-proofness. The conjunction of independence and
monotonicity is necessary and sufficient for the non-manipulability of
a judgment aggregation rule by strategic voting (Dietrich and List
2007c; for related results, see Nehring and Puppe 2002). Thus we cannot
generally achieve strategy-proofness without relaxing either universal
domain, or collective rationality, or unanimity preservation, or
non-dictatorship. In practice, we must therefore look for ways of
rendering opportunities for strategic manipulation less of a
threat.</p>

<p>

As should be evident, social choice theory is a vast field. Areas
not covered in this entry, or mentioned only in passing, include:
theories of fair division (how to divide one or several divisible or
indivisible goods, such as cakes or houses, between several claimants;
e.g., Brams and Taylor 1996 and Moulin 2004); behavioural social choice
theory (analyzing empirical evidence of voting behaviour under various
aggregation rules; e.g., Regenwetter et al. 2006; List, Luskin,
Fishkin, and McLean 2013); empirical social choice theory (analysing
surveys and experiments on people's intuitions about distributive
justice; e.g., Gaertner and Schokkaert 2012); computational social
choice theory (analysing computational properties of aggregation rules,
including their computational complexity; e.g., Bartholdi, Tovey, and
Trick 1989; Brandt, Conitzer, and Endriss 2013); theories of
probability aggregation (studying the aggregation of probability or
credence functions; e.g., Lehrer and Wagner 1981; McConway 1981; Genest
and Zidek 1986; Mongin 1995; Dietrich and List 2007d); theories of
general attitude aggregation (generalizing two-valued judgment
aggregation, probability/credence aggregation, and preference
aggregation; e.g., Dietrich and List 2010b; Dokow and Holzman 2010c);
the study of collective decision-making in non-human animals (studying
group decisions in a variety of animal species from social insects to
primates, as surveyed in Conradt and List 2009 and the special issue it
introduces); and applications to social epistemology (the analysis of
group doxastic states and their relationship to individual doxastic
states; e.g., Goldman 2004, 2010).</p>

<h1>Ethics of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Apr 30, 2020</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are digital technologies
that will have significant impact on the development of humanity in the near
future. They have raised fundamental questions about what we should do
with these systems, what the systems themselves should do, what risks
they involve, and how we can control these.</p>

<p>
After the Introduction to the field (&sect;1), the main themes (&sect;2) of this
article are: Ethical issues that arise with AI systems as
<em>objects</em>, i.e., tools made and used by humans. This includes
issues of privacy (&sect;2.1) and manipulation (&sect;2.2), opacity (&sect;2.3) and bias (&sect;2.4), human-robot
interaction (&sect;2.5), employment (&sect;2.6), and the effects of autonomy (&sect;2.7). Then AI systems
as <em>subjects</em>, i.e., ethics for the AI systems themselves in
machine ethics (&sect;2.8) and artificial moral agency (&sect;2.9). Finally, the problem of a
possible future AI superintelligence leading to a
&ldquo;singularity&rdquo; (&sect;2.10). We close with a remark on the vision of AI (&sect;3).</p>

<p>
For each section within these themes, we provide a general explanation
of the <em>ethical issues</em>, outline existing <em>positions</em>
and <em>arguments</em>, then analyse how these play out with current
<em>technologies</em> and finally, what <em>policy</em> consequences
may be drawn.</p>

<h2 id="Intr">1. Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="BackFiel">1.1 Background of the Field</h3>

<p>
The ethics of AI and robotics is often focused on
&ldquo;concerns&rdquo; of various sorts, which is a typical response
to new technologies. Many such concerns turn out to be rather quaint
(trains are too fast for souls); some are predictably wrong when they
suggest that the technology will fundamentally change humans
(telephones will destroy personal communication, writing will destroy
memory, video cassettes will make going out redundant); some are
broadly correct but moderately relevant (digital technology will
destroy industries that make photographic film, cassette tapes, or
vinyl records); but some are broadly correct and deeply relevant (cars
will kill children and fundamentally change the landscape). The task
of an article such as this is to analyse the issues and to deflate the
non-issues.</p>

<p>
Some technologies, like nuclear power, cars, or plastics, have caused
ethical and political discussion and significant policy efforts to
control the trajectory these technologies, usually only once some
damage is done. In addition to such &ldquo;ethical concerns&rdquo;,
new technologies challenge current norms and conceptual systems, which
is of particular interest to philosophy. Finally, once we have
understood a technology in its context, we need to shape our societal
response, including regulation and law. All these features also exist
in the case of new AI and Robotics technologies&mdash;plus the more
fundamental fear that they may end the era of human control on
Earth.</p>

<p>
The ethics of AI and robotics has seen significant press coverage in
recent years, which supports related research, but also may end up
undermining it: the press often talks as if the issues under
discussion were just predictions of what future technology will bring,
and as though we already know what would be most ethical and how to
achieve that. Press coverage thus focuses on risk, security (Brundage
et al. 2018, in the <a href="#Oth">Other Internet Resources</a> section
below, hereafter [OIR]),
 and prediction of impact (e.g., on the job market). The
result is a discussion of essentially technical problems that focus on
how to achieve a desired outcome. Current discussions in policy and
industry are also motivated by image and public relations, where the
label &ldquo;ethical&rdquo; is really not much more than the new
&ldquo;green&rdquo;, perhaps used for &ldquo;ethics washing&rdquo;.
For a problem to qualify as a problem for AI ethics would require that
we do <em>not</em> readily know what the right thing to do is. In this
sense, job loss, theft, or killing with AI is not a problem in ethics,
but whether these are permissible under certain circumstances
<em>is</em> a problem. This article focuses on the genuine problems of
ethics where we do not readily know what the answers are.</p>

<p>
A last caveat: The ethics of AI and robotics is a very young field
within applied ethics, with significant dynamics, but few
well-established issues and no authoritative overviews&mdash;though
there is a promising outline (European Group on Ethics in Science and
New Technologies 2018) and there are beginnings on societal impact
(Floridi et al. 2018; Taddeo and Floridi 2018; S. Taylor et al. 2018;
Walsh 2018; Bryson 2019; Gibert 2019; 
<!-- SIENNA 2019; --> 
Whittlestone et al.  2019), and policy recommendations (AI HLEG 2019
[OIR]; IEEE 2019). So this article cannot merely reproduce what the
community has achieved thus far, but must propose an ordering where
little order exists.</p>

<h3 id="AIRobo">1.2 AI &amp; Robotics</h3>

<p>
The notion of &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; (AI) is understood
broadly as any kind of artificial computational system that shows
intelligent behaviour, i.e., complex behaviour that is conducive to
reaching goals. In particular, we do not wish to restrict
&ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; to what would require intelligence if done
by <em>humans</em>, as Minsky had suggested (1985). This means we
incorporate a range of machines, including those in &ldquo;technical
AI&rdquo;, that show only limited abilities in learning or reasoning
but excel at the automation of particular tasks, as well as machines
in &ldquo;general AI&rdquo; that aim to create a generally intelligent
agent.</p>

<p>
AI somehow gets closer to our skin than other technologies&mdash;thus
the field of &ldquo;philosophy of AI&rdquo;. Perhaps this is because
the project of AI is to create machines that have a feature central to
how we humans see ourselves, namely as feeling, thinking, intelligent
beings. The main purposes of an artificially intelligent agent
probably involve sensing, modelling, planning and action, but current
AI applications also include perception, text analysis, natural
language processing (NLP), logical reasoning, game-playing, decision
support systems, data analytics, predictive analytics, as well as
autonomous vehicles and other forms of robotics (P. Stone et al.
2016). AI may involve any number of computational techniques to
achieve these aims, be that classical symbol-manipulating AI, inspired
by natural cognition, or machine learning via neural networks
(Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville 2016; Silver et al. 2018).</p>

<p>
Historically, it is worth noting that the term &ldquo;AI&rdquo; was
used as above ca. 1950&ndash;1975, then came into disrepute during the
&ldquo;AI winter&rdquo;, ca. 1975&ndash;1995, and narrowed. As a
result, areas such as &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo;, &ldquo;natural
language processing&rdquo; and &ldquo;data science&rdquo; were often
not labelled as &ldquo;AI&rdquo;. Since ca. 2010, the use has
broadened again, and at times almost all of computer science and even
high-tech is lumped under &ldquo;AI&rdquo;. Now it is a name to be
proud of, a booming industry with massive capital investment (Shoham
et al. 2018), and on the edge of hype again. As Erik Brynjolfsson
noted, it may allow us to

</p><blockquote>
<p>virtually eliminate global poverty, massively reduce disease
and provide better education to almost everyone on the planet.
(quoted in Anderson, Rainie, and Luchsinger 2018)</p>
</blockquote> 

<p>
While AI can be entirely software, robots are physical machines that
move. Robots are subject to physical impact, typically through
&ldquo;sensors&rdquo;, and they exert physical force onto the world,
typically through &ldquo;actuators&rdquo;, like a gripper or a turning
wheel. Accordingly, autonomous cars or planes are robots, and only a
minuscule portion of robots is &ldquo;humanoid&rdquo; (human-shaped),
like in the movies. Some robots use AI, and some do not: Typical
industrial robots blindly follow completely defined scripts with
minimal sensory input and no learning or reasoning (around 500,000
such new industrial robots are installed each year (IFR 2019 [OIR])). It is
probably fair to say that while robotics systems cause more concerns
in the general public, AI systems are more likely to have a greater
impact on humanity. Also, AI or robotics systems for a narrow set of
tasks are less likely to cause new issues than systems that are more
flexible and autonomous.</p>

<p>
Robotics and AI can thus be seen as covering two overlapping sets of
systems: systems that are only AI, systems that are only robotics, and
systems that are both. We are interested in all three; the scope of
this article is thus not only the intersection, but the union, of both
sets.</p>

<h3 id="NotePoli">1.3 A Note on Policy</h3>

<p>
Policy is only one of the concerns of this article. There is
significant public discussion about AI ethics, and there are frequent
pronouncements from politicians that the matter requires new policy,
which is easier said than done: Actual technology policy is difficult
to plan and enforce. It can take many forms, from incentives and
funding, infrastructure, taxation, or good-will statements, to
regulation by various actors, and the law. Policy for AI will possibly
come into conflict with other aims of technology policy or general
policy. Governments, parliaments, associations, and industry circles
in industrialised countries have produced reports and white papers in
recent years, and some have generated good-will slogans
(&ldquo;trusted/responsible/humane/human-centred/good/beneficial
AI&rdquo;), but is that what is needed? For a survey, see Jobin,
Ienca, and Vayena (2019) and V. M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s list of
 <a href="http://www.pt-ai.org/TG-ELS/policy/" target="other">PT-AI Policy Documents and Institutions</a>.</p>

<p>
For people who work in ethics and policy, there might be a tendency to
overestimate the impact and threats from a new technology, and to
underestimate how far current regulation can reach (e.g., for product
liability). On the other hand, there is a tendency for businesses, the
military, and some public administrations to &ldquo;just talk&rdquo;
and do some &ldquo;ethics washing&rdquo; in order to preserve a good
public image and continue as before. Actually implementing legally
binding regulation would challenge existing business models and
practices. Actual policy is not just an implementation of ethical
theory, but subject to societal power structures&mdash;and the agents
that do have the power will push against anything that restricts them.
There is thus a significant risk that regulation will remain toothless
in the face of economical and political power.</p>

<p>
Though very little actual policy has been produced, there are some
notable beginnings: The latest EU policy document suggests
&ldquo;trustworthy AI&rdquo; should be lawful, ethical, and
technically robust, and then spells this out as seven requirements:
human oversight, technical robustness, privacy and data governance,
transparency, fairness, well-being, and accountability (AI HLEG 2019 [OIR]).
Much European research now runs under the slogan of &ldquo;responsible
research and innovation&rdquo; (RRI), and &ldquo;technology
assessment&rdquo; has been a standard field since the advent of
nuclear power. Professional ethics is also a standard field in
information technology, and this includes issues that are relevant in
this article. Perhaps a &ldquo;code of ethics&rdquo; for AI engineers,
analogous to the codes of ethics for medical doctors, is an option
here (V&eacute;liz 2019). What data science itself should do is
addressed in (L. Taylor and Purtova 2019). We also expect that much
policy will eventually cover specific uses or technologies of AI and
robotics, rather than the field as a whole. A useful summary of an
ethical framework for AI is given in (European Group on Ethics in
Science and New Technologies 2018: 13ff). On general AI policy, see
Calo (2018) as well as Crawford and Calo (2016); Stahl, Timmermans,
and Mittelstadt (2016); Johnson and Verdicchio (2017); and Giubilini
and Savulescu (2018). A more political angle of technology is often
discussed in the field of &ldquo;Science and Technology Studies&rdquo; (STS). As
books like <em>The Ethics of Invention</em> (Jasanoff 2016) show,
concerns in STS are often quite similar to those in ethics (Jacobs et
al. 2019 [OIR]). In this article, we discuss the policy for each type of
issue separately rather than for AI or robotics in general.</p>

<h2 id="MainDeba">2. Main Debates</h2>

<p>
In this section we outline the ethical issues of human use of AI and
robotics systems that can be more or less autonomous&mdash;which means
we look at issues that arise with certain uses of the technologies
which would not arise with others. It must be kept in mind, however,
that technologies will always cause some uses to be easier, and thus
more frequent, and hinder other uses. The design of technical
artefacts thus has ethical relevance for their use (Houkes and Vermaas
2010; Verbeek 2011), so beyond &ldquo;responsible use&rdquo;, we also
need &ldquo;responsible design&rdquo; in this field. The focus on use
does not presuppose which ethical approaches are best suited for
tackling these issues; they might well be virtue ethics (Vallor 2017)
rather than consequentialist or value-based (Floridi et al. 2018).
This section is also neutral with respect to the question whether AI
systems truly have &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; or other mental
properties: It would apply equally well if AI and robotics are merely
seen as the current face of automation (cf. M&uuml;ller
forthcoming-b).</p>

<h3 id="PrivSurv">2.1 Privacy &amp; Surveillance</h3>

<p>
There is a general discussion about privacy and surveillance in
information technology (e.g., Macnish 2017; Roessler 2017), which
mainly concerns the access to private data and data that is personally
identifiable. Privacy has several well recognised aspects, e.g.,
&ldquo;the right to be let alone&rdquo;, information privacy, privacy
as an aspect of personhood, control over information about oneself,
and the right to secrecy (Bennett and Raab 2006). Privacy studies have
historically focused on state surveillance by secret services but now
include surveillance by other state agents, businesses, and even
individuals. The technology has changed significantly in the last
decades while regulation has been slow to respond (though there is the
Regulation (EU) 2016/679)&mdash;the result is a certain anarchy that
is exploited by the most powerful players, sometimes in plain sight,
sometimes in hiding.</p>

<p>
The digital sphere has widened greatly: All data collection and
storage is now digital, our lives are increasingly digital, most
digital data is connected to a single Internet, and there is more and
more sensor technology in use that generates data about non-digital
aspects of our lives. AI increases both the possibilities of
intelligent data collection and the possibilities for data analysis.
This applies to blanket surveillance of whole populations as well as
to classic targeted surveillance. In addition, much of the data is
traded between agents, usually for a fee.</p>

<p>
At the same time, controlling who collects which data, and who has
access, is much harder in the digital world than it was in the
analogue world of paper and telephone calls. Many new AI technologies
amplify the known issues. For example, face recognition in photos and
videos allows identification and thus profiling and searching for
individuals (Whittaker et al. 2018: 15ff). This continues using other
techniques for identification, e.g., &ldquo;device
fingerprinting&rdquo;, which are commonplace on the Internet
(sometimes revealed in the &ldquo;privacy policy&rdquo;). The result
is that &ldquo;In this vast ocean of data, there is a frighteningly
complete picture of us&rdquo; (Smolan 2016: 1:01). The result is
arguably a scandal that still has not received due public
attention.</p>

<p>
The data trail we leave behind is how our &ldquo;free&rdquo; services
are paid for&mdash;but we are not told about that data collection and
the value of this new raw material, and we are manipulated into
leaving ever more such data. For the &ldquo;big 5&rdquo; companies
(Amazon, Google/Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook), the main
data-collection part of their business appears to be based on
deception, exploiting human weaknesses, furthering procrastination,
generating addiction, and manipulation (Harris 2016 [OIR]). The
primary focus of social media, gaming, and most of the Internet in
this &ldquo;surveillance economy&rdquo; is to gain, maintain, and
direct attention&mdash;and thus data supply. &ldquo;Surveillance is
the business model of the Internet&rdquo; (Schneier 2015). This
surveillance and attention economy is sometimes called
&ldquo;surveillance capitalism&rdquo; (Zuboff 2019). It has caused
many attempts to escape from the grasp of these corporations, e.g., in
exercises of &ldquo;minimalism&rdquo; (Newport 2019), sometimes
through the open source movement, but it appears that present-day
citizens have lost the degree of autonomy needed to escape while fully
continuing with their life and work. We have lost ownership of our
data, if &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; is the right relation here. Arguably,
we have lost control of our data.</p>

<p>
These systems will often reveal facts about us that we ourselves wish
to suppress or are not aware of: they know more about us than we know
ourselves. Even just observing online behaviour allows insights into
our mental states (Burr and Christianini 2019) and manipulation (see
below
 <a href="#ManiBeha">section 2.2</a>).
 This has led to calls for the protection of &ldquo;derived
data&rdquo; (Wachter and Mittelstadt 2019). With the last sentence of
his bestselling book, <em>Homo Deus</em>, Harari asks about the
long-term consequences of AI: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What will happen to society, politics and daily life when
non-conscious but highly intelligent algorithms know us better than we
know ourselves? (2016: 462)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Robotic devices have not yet played a major role in this area, except
for security patrolling, but this will change once they are more
common outside of industry environments. Together with the
&ldquo;Internet of things&rdquo;, the so-called &ldquo;smart&rdquo;
systems (phone, TV, oven, lamp, virtual assistant, home,&hellip;),
&ldquo;smart city&rdquo; (Sennett 2018), and &ldquo;smart
governance&rdquo;, they are set to become part of the data-gathering
machinery that offers more detailed data, of different types, in real
time, with ever more information.</p>

<p>
Privacy-preserving techniques that can largely conceal the identity of
persons or groups are now a standard staple in data science; they
include (relative) anonymisation , access control (plus encryption),
and other models where computation is carried out with fully or
partially encrypted input data (Stahl and Wright 2018); in the case of
&ldquo;differential privacy&rdquo;, this is done by adding calibrated
noise to encrypt the output of queries (Dwork et al. 2006; Abowd
2017). While requiring more effort and cost, such techniques can avoid
many of the privacy issues. Some companies have also seen better
privacy as a competitive advantage that can be leveraged and sold at a
price.</p>

<p>
One of the major practical difficulties is to actually enforce
regulation, both on the level of the state and on the level of the
individual who has a claim. They must identify the responsible legal
entity, prove the action, perhaps prove intent, find a court that
declares itself competent &hellip; and eventually get the court to
actually enforce its decision. Well-established legal protection of
rights such as consumer rights, product liability, and other civil
liability or protection of intellectual property rights is often
missing in digital products, or hard to enforce. This means that
companies with a &ldquo;digital&rdquo; background are used to testing
their products on the consumers without fear of liability while
heavily defending their intellectual property rights. This
&ldquo;Internet Libertarianism&rdquo; is sometimes taken to assume
that technical solutions will take care of societal problems by
themselves (Mozorov 2013).</p>

<h3 id="ManiBeha">2.2 Manipulation of Behaviour</h3>

<p>
The ethical issues of AI in surveillance go beyond the mere
<em>accumulation</em> of data and direction of attention: They include
the <em>use</em> of information to manipulate behaviour, online and
offline, in a way that undermines autonomous rational choice. Of
course, efforts to manipulate behaviour are ancient, but they may gain
a new quality when they use AI systems. Given users&rsquo; intense
interaction with data systems and the deep knowledge about individuals
this provides, they are vulnerable to &ldquo;nudges&rdquo;,
manipulation, and deception. With sufficient prior data, algorithms
can be used to target individuals or small groups with just the kind
of input that is likely to influence these particular individuals. A
&rsquo;nudge&lsquo; changes the environment such that it influences
behaviour in a predictable way that is positive for the individual,
but easy and cheap to avoid (Thaler &amp; Sunstein 2008). There is a
slippery slope from here to paternalism and manipulation.</p>

<p>
Many advertisers, marketers, and online sellers will use any legal
means at their disposal to maximise profit, including exploitation of
behavioural biases, deception, and addiction generation (Costa and
Halpern 2019 [OIR]). Such manipulation is the
business model in much of the gambling and gaming industries, but it
is spreading, e.g., to low-cost airlines.  In interface design on web
pages or in games, this manipulation uses what is called &ldquo;dark
patterns&rdquo; (Mathur et al. 2019). At this moment, gambling and the
sale of addictive substances are highly regulated, but online
manipulation and addiction are not&mdash;even though manipulation of
online behaviour is becoming a core business model of the
Internet.</p>

<p>
Furthermore, social media is now the prime location for political
propaganda. This influence can be used to steer voting behaviour, as
in the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica &ldquo;scandal&rdquo; (Woolley and
Howard 2017; Bradshaw, Neudert, and Howard 2019) and&mdash;if
successful&mdash;it may harm the autonomy of individuals (Susser,
Roessler, and Nissenbaum 2019).</p>

<p>
Improved AI &ldquo;faking&rdquo; technologies make what once was
reliable evidence into unreliable evidence&mdash;this has already
happened to digital photos, sound recordings, and video. It will soon
be quite easy to create (rather than alter) &ldquo;deep fake&rdquo;
text, photos, and video material with any desired content. Soon,
sophisticated real-time interaction with persons over text, phone, or
video will be faked, too. So we cannot trust digital interactions
while we are at the same time increasingly dependent on such
interactions.</p>

<p>
One more specific issue is that machine learning techniques in AI rely
on training with vast amounts of data. This means there will often be
a trade-off between privacy and rights to data vs. technical quality
of the product. This influences the consequentialist evaluation of
privacy-violating practices.</p>

<p>
The policy in this field has its ups and downs: Civil liberties and
the protection of individual rights are under intense pressure from
businesses&rsquo; lobbying, secret services, and other state agencies
that depend on surveillance. Privacy protection has diminished
massively compared to the pre-digital age when communication was based
on letters, analogue telephone communications, and personal
conversation and when surveillance operated under significant legal
constraints.</p>

<p>
While the EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU)
2016/679) has strengthened privacy protection, the US and China prefer
growth with less regulation (Thompson and Bremmer 2018), likely in the
hope that this provides a competitive advantage. It is clear that
state and business actors have increased their ability to invade
privacy and manipulate people with the help of AI technology and will
continue to do so to further their particular interests&mdash;unless
reined in by policy in the interest of general society.</p>

<h3 id="OpacAISyst">2.3 Opacity of AI Systems</h3>

<p>
Opacity and bias are central issues in what is now sometimes called
&ldquo;data ethics&rdquo; or &ldquo;big data ethics&rdquo; (Floridi
and Taddeo 2016; Mittelstadt and Floridi 2016). AI systems for
automated decision support and &ldquo;predictive analytics&rdquo;
raise &ldquo;significant concerns about lack of due process,
accountability, community engagement, and auditing&rdquo; (Whittaker
et al. 2018: 18ff). They are part of a power structure in which
&ldquo;we are creating decision-making processes that constrain and
limit opportunities for human participation&rdquo; (Danaher 2016b:
245). At the same time, it will often be impossible for the affected
person to know how the system came to this output, i.e., the system is
&ldquo;opaque&rdquo; to that person. If the system involves machine
learning, it will typically be opaque even to the expert, who will not
know how a particular pattern was identified, or even what the pattern
is. Bias in decision systems and data sets is exacerbated by this
opacity. So, at least in cases where there is a desire to remove bias,
the analysis of opacity and bias go hand in hand, and political
response has to tackle both issues together.</p>

<p>
Many AI systems rely on machine learning techniques in (simulated)
neural networks that will extract patterns from a given dataset, with
or without &ldquo;correct&rdquo; solutions provided; i.e., supervised,
semi-supervised or unsupervised. With these techniques, the
&ldquo;learning&rdquo; captures patterns in the data and these are
labelled in a way that appears useful to the decision the system
makes, while the programmer does not really know <em>which</em>
patterns in the data the system has used. In fact, the programs are
evolving, so when new data comes in, or new feedback is given
(&ldquo;this was correct&rdquo;, &ldquo;this was incorrect&rdquo;),
the patterns used by the learning system change. What this means is
that the outcome is not transparent to the user or programmers: it is
opaque. Furthermore, the quality of the program depends heavily on the
quality of the data provided, following the old slogan &ldquo;garbage
in, garbage out&rdquo;. So, if the data already involved a bias (e.g.,
police data about the skin colour of suspects), then the program will
reproduce that bias. There are proposals for a standard description of
datasets in a &ldquo;datasheet&rdquo; that would make the
identification of such bias more feasible (Gebru et al. 2018 [OIR]). There
is also significant recent literature about the limitations of machine
learning systems that are essentially sophisticated data filters
(Marcus 2018 [OIR]). Some have argued that the ethical problems of today are
the result of technical &ldquo;shortcuts&rdquo; AI has taken
(Cristianini forthcoming).</p>

<p>
There are several technical activities that aim at &ldquo;explainable
AI&rdquo;, starting with (Van Lent, Fisher, and Mancuso 1999; Lomas et
al. 2012) and, more recently, a DARPA programme (Gunning 2017 [OIR]).
<!-- and the AI4EU project on &ldquo;human-centred AI&rdquo; (AI4EU 2019: 100&ndash;187). -->
More broadly, the demand for </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a mechanism for elucidating and articulating the power structures,
biases, and influences that computational artefacts exercise in
society (Diakopoulos 2015: 398)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
is sometimes called &ldquo;algorithmic accountability
reporting&rdquo;. This does not mean that we expect an AI to
&ldquo;explain its reasoning&rdquo;&mdash;doing so would require far
more serious moral autonomy than we currently attribute to AI systems
(see below
 <a href="#ArtiMoraAgen">&sect;2.10</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The politician Henry Kissinger pointed out that there is a fundamental
problem for democratic decision-making if we rely on a system that is
supposedly superior to humans, but cannot explain its decisions. He
says we may have &ldquo;generated a potentially dominating technology
in search of a guiding philosophy&rdquo; (Kissinger 2018).  Danaher
(2016b) calls this problem &ldquo;the threat of algocracy&rdquo;
(adopting the previous use of &lsquo;algocracy&rsquo; from Aneesh 2002
[OIR], 2006).  In a similar vein, Cave (2019)
stresses that we need a broader societal move towards more
&ldquo;democratic&rdquo; decision-making to avoid AI being a force
that leads to a Kafka-style impenetrable suppression system in public
administration and elsewhere. The political angle of this discussion
has been stressed by O&rsquo;Neil in her influential book <em>Weapons
of Math Destruction</em> (2016), and by Yeung and Lodge (2019).</p>

<p>
In the EU, some of these issues have been taken into account with the
(Regulation (EU) 2016/679), which foresees that consumers, when faced
with a decision based on data processing, will have a legal
&ldquo;right to explanation&rdquo;&mdash;how far this goes and to what
extent it can be enforced is disputed (Goodman and Flaxman 2017;
Wachter, Mittelstadt, and Floridi 2016; Wachter, Mittelstadt, and
Russell 2017). Zerilli et al. (2019) argue that there may be a double
standard here, where we demand a high level of explanation for
machine-based decisions despite humans sometimes not reaching that
standard themselves.</p>

<h3 id="BiasDeciSyst">2.4 Bias in Decision Systems</h3>

<p>
Automated AI decision support systems and &ldquo;predictive
analytics&rdquo; operate on data and produce a decision as
&ldquo;output&rdquo;. This output may range from the relatively
trivial to the highly significant: &ldquo;this restaurant matches your
preferences&rdquo;, &ldquo;the patient in this X-ray has completed
bone growth&rdquo;, &ldquo;application to credit card declined&rdquo;,
&ldquo;donor organ will be given to another patient&rdquo;,
&ldquo;bail is denied&rdquo;, or &ldquo;target identified and
engaged&rdquo;. Data analysis is often used in &ldquo;predictive
analytics&rdquo; in business, healthcare, and other fields, to foresee
future developments&mdash;since prediction is easier, it will also
become a cheaper commodity. One use of prediction is in
&ldquo;predictive policing&rdquo; (NIJ 2014 [OIR]), which many fear might
lead to an erosion of public liberties (Ferguson 2017) because it can
take away power from the people whose behaviour is predicted. It
appears, however, that many of the worries about policing depend on
futuristic scenarios where law enforcement foresees and punishes
planned actions, rather than waiting until a crime has been committed
(like in the 2002 film &ldquo;Minority Report&rdquo;). One concern is
that these systems might perpetuate bias that was already in the data
used to set up the system, e.g., by increasing police patrols in an
area and discovering more crime in that area. Actual &ldquo;predictive
policing&rdquo; or &ldquo;intelligence led policing&rdquo; techniques
mainly concern the question of where and when police forces will be
needed most. Also, police officers can be provided with more data, offering
them more control and facilitating better decisions, in workflow
support software (e.g., &ldquo;ArcGIS&rdquo;). Whether this is
problematic depends on the appropriate level of trust in the technical
quality of these systems, and on the evaluation of aims of the police
work itself. Perhaps a recent paper title points in the right
direction here: &ldquo;AI ethics in predictive policing: From models
of threat to an ethics of care&rdquo; (Asaro 2019).</p>

<p>
Bias typically surfaces when unfair judgments are made because the
individual making the judgment is influenced by a characteristic that
is <em>actually</em> irrelevant to the matter at hand, typically a
discriminatory preconception about members of a group. So, one form of
bias is a learned cognitive feature of a person, often not made
explicit. The person concerned may not be aware of having that
bias&mdash;they may even be honestly and explicitly opposed to a bias
they are found to have (e.g., through priming, cf. Graham and Lowery
2004). On fairness vs. bias in machine learning, see Binns (2018).</p>

<p>
Apart from the social phenomenon of learned bias, the human cognitive
system is generally prone to have various kinds of &ldquo;cognitive
biases&rdquo;, e.g., the &ldquo;confirmation bias&rdquo;: humans tend
to interpret information as confirming what they already believe. This
second form of bias is often said to impede performance in rational
judgment (Kahnemann 2011)&mdash;though at least some cognitive biases
generate an evolutionary advantage, e.g., economical use of resources
for intuitive judgment. There is a question whether AI systems could
or should have such cognitive bias.</p>

<p>
A third form of bias is present in data when it exhibits systematic
error, e.g., &ldquo;statistical bias&rdquo;. Strictly, any given
dataset will only be unbiased for a single kind of issue, so the mere
creation of a dataset involves the danger that it may be used for a
different kind of issue, and then turn out to be biased for that kind.
Machine learning on the basis of such data would then not only fail to
recognise the bias, but codify and automate the &ldquo;historical
bias&rdquo;. Such historical bias was discovered in an automated
recruitment screening system at Amazon (discontinued early 2017) that
discriminated against women&mdash;presumably because the company had a
history of discriminating against women in the hiring process. The
&ldquo;Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative
Sanctions&rdquo; (COMPAS), a system to predict whether a defendant
would re-offend, was found to be as successful (65.2% accuracy) as a
group of random humans (Dressel and Farid 2018) and to produce more
false positives and less false negatives for black defendants. The
problem with such systems is thus bias plus humans placing excessive
trust in the systems. The political dimensions of such automated
systems in the USA are investigated in Eubanks (2018).</p>

<p>
There are significant technical efforts to detect and remove bias from
AI systems, but it is fair to say that these are in early stages: see
UK Institute for Ethical AI &amp; Machine Learning (Brownsword,
Scotford, and Yeung 2017; Yeung and Lodge 2019). It appears that
technological fixes have their limits in that they need a mathematical
notion of fairness, which is hard to come by (Whittaker et al. 2018:
24ff; Selbst et al. 2019), as is a formal notion of &ldquo;race&rdquo;
(see Benthall and Haynes 2019). An institutional proposal is in (Veale
and Binns 2017).</p>

<h3 id="HumaRoboInte">2.5 Human-Robot Interaction</h3>

<p>
Human-robot interaction (HRI) is an academic fields in its own right,
which now pays significant attention to ethical matters, the dynamics
of perception from both sides, and both the different interests
present in and the intricacy of the social context, including
co-working (e.g., Arnold and Scheutz 2017). Useful surveys for the
ethics of robotics include Calo, Froomkin, and Kerr (2016); Royakkers
and van Est (2016); Tzafestas (2016); a standard collection of papers
is Lin, Abney, and Jenkins (2017).</p>

<p>
While AI can be used to manipulate humans into believing and doing
things (see <a href="#ManiBeha">section 2.2</a>), it can also be used
to drive robots that are problematic if their processes or appearance
involve deception, threaten human dignity, or violate the Kantian
requirement of &ldquo;respect for humanity&rdquo;. Humans very easily
attribute mental properties to objects, and empathise with them,
especially when the outer appearance of these objects is similar to
that of living beings. This can be used to deceive humans (or animals)
into attributing more intellectual or even emotional significance to
robots or AI systems than they deserve.  Some parts of humanoid
robotics are problematic in this regard (e.g., Hiroshi
Ishiguro&rsquo;s remote-controlled Geminoids), and there are cases
that have been clearly deceptive for public-relations purposes (e.g. on the abilities of
Hanson Robotics&rsquo; &ldquo;Sophia&rdquo;). Of course, some fairly
basic constraints of business ethics and law apply to robots, too:
product safety and liability, or non-deception in advertisement.  It
appears that these existing constraints take care of many concerns
that are raised. There are cases, however, where human-human
interaction has aspects that appear specifically human in ways that
can perhaps not be replaced by robots: care, love, and sex.</p>

<h4>2.5.1 Example (a) Care Robots</h4>

<p>
The use of robots in health care for humans is currently at the level
of concept studies in real environments, but it may become a usable
technology in a few years, and has raised a number of concerns for a
dystopian future of de-humanised care (A. Sharkey and N. Sharkey 2011;
Robert Sparrow 2016). Current systems include robots that support
human carers/caregivers (e.g., in lifting patients, or transporting
material), robots that enable patients to do certain things by
themselves (e.g., eat with a robotic arm), but also robots that are
given to patients as company and comfort (e.g., the &ldquo;Paro&rdquo;
robot seal). For an overview, see van Wynsberghe (2016);
N&oslash;rskov (2017); Fosch-Villaronga and Albo-Canals (2019), for a
survey of users Draper et al. (2014).</p>

<p>
One reason why the issue of care has come to the fore is that people
have argued that we will need robots in ageing societies. This
argument makes problematic assumptions, namely that with longer
lifespan people will need more care, and that it will not be possible
to attract more humans to caring professions. It may also show a bias
about age (Jecker forthcoming). Most importantly, it ignores the
nature of automation, which is not simply about replacing humans, but
about allowing humans to work more efficiently. It is not very clear
that there really is an issue here since the discussion mostly focuses
on the fear of robots de-humanising care, but the actual and
foreseeable robots in care are assistive robots for classic automation
of technical tasks. They are thus &ldquo;care robots&rdquo; only in a
behavioural sense of performing tasks in care environments, not in the
sense that a human &ldquo;cares&rdquo; for the patients. It appears
that the success of &ldquo;being cared for&rdquo; relies on this
intentional sense of &ldquo;care&rdquo;, which foreseeable robots
cannot provide. If anything, the risk of robots in care is the
<em>absence</em> of such intentional care&mdash;because less human
carers may be needed. Interestingly, caring for something, even a
virtual agent, can be good for the carer themselves (Lee et al. 2019).
A system that pretends to care would be deceptive and thus
problematic&mdash;unless the deception is countered by sufficiently
large utility gain (Coeckelbergh 2016). Some robots that pretend to
&ldquo;care&rdquo; on a basic level are available (Paro seal) and
others are in the making. Perhaps feeling cared for by a machine, to
some extent, is progress for come patients.</p>

<h4>2.5.2 Example (b) Sex Robots</h4>

<p>
It has been argued by several tech optimists that humans will likely
be interested in sex and companionship with robots and be comfortable
with the idea (Levy 2007). Given the variation of human sexual
preferences, including sex toys and sex dolls, this seems very likely:
The question is whether such devices should be manufactured and
promoted, and whether there should be limits in this touchy area.
It seems to have moved into the mainstream of &ldquo;robot
philosophy&rdquo; in recent times (Sullins 2012; Danaher and McArthur
2017; N. Sharkey et al. 2017 [OIR]; Bendel 2018; Devlin 2018).</p>

<p>
Humans have long had deep emotional attachments to objects, so perhaps
companionship or even love with a predictable android is attractive,
especially to people who struggle with actual humans, and already
prefer dogs, cats, birds, a computer or a <em>tamagotchi</em>. Danaher
(2019b) argues against (Nyholm and Frank 2017) that these can be true
friendships, and is thus a valuable goal. It certainly looks like such
friendship might increase overall utility, even if lacking in depth.
In these discussions there is an issue of deception, since a robot
cannot (at present) mean what it says, or have feelings for a human.
It is well known that humans are prone to attribute feelings and
thoughts to entities that behave as if they had sentience,even to
clearly inanimate objects that show no behaviour at all. Also, paying
for deception seems to be an elementary part of the traditional sex
industry.</p>

<p>
Finally, there are concerns that have often accompanied matters of
sex, namely consent (Frank and Nyholm 2017), aesthetic concerns, and
the worry that humans may be &ldquo;corrupted&rdquo; by certain
experiences. Old fashioned though this may seem, human behaviour is
influenced by experience, and it is likely that pornography or sex
robots support the perception of other humans as mere objects of
desire, or even recipients of abuse, and thus ruin a deeper sexual and
erotic experience. In this vein, the &ldquo;Campaign Against Sex Robots&rdquo;
argues that these devices are a continuation of slavery and
prostitution (Richardson 2016).</p>

<h3 id="AutoEmpl">2.6 Automation and Employment</h3>

<p> It seems clear that AI and robotics will lead to significant gains
in productivity and thus overall wealth. The attempt to increase
productivity has often been a feature of the economy, though the
emphasis on &ldquo;growth&rdquo; is a modern phenomenon (Harari 2016:
240). However, productivity gains through automation typically mean
that fewer humans are required for the same output. This does not
necessarily imply a loss of overall employment, however, because
available wealth increases and that can increase demand sufficiently
to counteract the productivity gain. In the long run, higher
productivity in industrial societies has led to more wealth overall.
Major labour market disruptions have occurred in the past, e.g.,
farming employed over 60% of the workforce in Europe and North-America
in 1800, while by 2010 it employed ca. 5% in the EU, and even less in
the wealthiest countries (European Commission 2013). In the 20 years
between 1950 and 1970 the number of hired agricultural workers in the
UK was reduced by 50% (Zayed and Loft 2019). Some of these disruptions
lead to more labour-intensive industries moving to places with lower
labour cost. This is an ongoing process.</p>

<p>
Classic automation replaced human muscle, whereas digital automation
replaces human thought or information-processing&mdash;and unlike
physical machines, digital automation is very cheap to duplicate
(Bostrom and Yudkowsky 2014). It may thus mean a more radical change
on the labour market. So, the main question is: will the effects be
different this time? Will the creation of new jobs and wealth keep up
with the destruction of jobs? And even if it is <em>not</em>
different, what are the transition costs, and who bears them? Do we
need to make societal adjustments for a fair distribution of costs and
benefits of digital automation?</p> 

<p>
Responses to the issue of unemployment from AI have ranged from the
alarmed (Frey and Osborne 2013; Westlake 2014) to the neutral
(Metcalf, Keller, and Boyd 2016 [OIR]; Calo 2018; Frey 2019) to the
optimistic (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2016; Harari 2016; Danaher 2019a).
In principle, the labour market effect of automation seems to be
fairly well understood as involving two channels: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
(i) the nature of interactions between differently skilled workers and
new technologies affecting labour demand and (ii) the equilibrium
effects of technological progress through consequent changes in labour
supply and product markets. (Goos 2018: 362) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What currently seems to happen in the labour market as a result of AI
and robotics automation is &ldquo;job polarisation&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;dumbbell&rdquo; shape (Goos, Manning, and Salomons 2009): The
highly skilled technical jobs are in demand and highly paid, the low
skilled service jobs are in demand and badly paid, but the
mid-qualification jobs in factories and offices, i.e., the majority of
jobs, are under pressure and reduced because they are relatively
predictable, and most likely to be automated (Baldwin 2019).</p>

<p>
Perhaps enormous productivity gains will allow the &ldquo;age of
leisure&rdquo; to be realised, something (Keynes 1930) had predicted
to occur around 2030, assuming a growth rate of 1% per annum.
Actually, we have already reached the level he anticipated for 2030,
but we are still working&mdash;consuming more and inventing ever more
levels of organisation. Harari explains how this economic development
allowed humanity to overcome hunger, disease, and war&mdash;and now we
aim for immortality and eternal bliss through AI, thus his title
<em>Homo Deus</em> (Harari 2016: 75).</p>

<p>
In general terms, the issue of unemployment is an issue of how goods
in a society should be justly distributed. A standard view is that
distributive justice should be rationally decided from behind a
&ldquo;veil of ignorance&rdquo; (Rawls 1971), i.e., as if one does not
know what position in a society one would actually be taking (labourer
or industrialist, etc.). Rawls thought the chosen principles would
then support basic liberties and a distribution that is of greatest
benefit to the least-advantaged members of society. It would appear
that the AI economy has three features that make such justice
unlikely: First, it operates in a largely unregulated environment
where responsibility is often hard to allocate. Second, it operates in
markets that have a &ldquo;winner takes all&rdquo; feature where
monopolies develop quickly. Third, the &ldquo;new economy&rdquo; of
the digital service industries is based on intangible assets, also
called &ldquo;capitalism without capital&rdquo; (Haskel and Westlake
2017). This means that it is difficult to control multinational
digital corporations that do not rely on a physical plant in a
particular location. These three features seem to suggest that if we
leave the distribution of wealth to free market forces, the result
would be a heavily unjust distribution: And this is indeed a
development that we can already see.</p>

<p>
One interesting question that has not received too much attention is
whether the development of AI is environmentally sustainable: Like all
computing systems, AI systems produce waste that is very hard to
recycle and they consume vast amounts of energy, especially for the
training of machine learning systems (and even for the
&ldquo;mining&rdquo; of cryptocurrency). Again, it appears that some
actors in this space offload such costs to the general society.</p>

<h3 id="AutoSyst">2.7 Autonomous Systems</h3>

<p>
There are several notions of autonomy in the discussion of autonomous
systems. A stronger notion is involved in philosophical debates where
autonomy is the basis for responsibility and personhood (Christman
2003 [2018]). In this context, responsibility implies autonomy, but
not inversely, so there can be systems that have degrees of technical
autonomy without raising issues of responsibility. The weaker, more
technical, notion of autonomy in robotics is relative and gradual: A
system is said to be autonomous with respect to human control to a
certain degree (M&uuml;ller 2012). There is a parallel here to the
issues of bias and opacity in AI since autonomy also concerns a
power-relation: who is in control, and who is responsible?</p>

<p>
Generally speaking, one question is the degree to which autonomous
robots raise issues our present conceptual schemes must adapt to, or
whether they just require technical adjustments. In most
jurisdictions, there is a sophisticated system of civil and criminal
liability to resolve such issues. Technical standards, e.g., for the
safe use of machinery in medical environments, will likely need to be
adjusted. There is already a field of &ldquo;verifiable AI&rdquo; for
such safety-critical systems and for &ldquo;security
applications&rdquo;. Bodies like the IEEE (The Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers) and the BSI (British Standards Institution)
have produced &ldquo;standards&rdquo;, particularly on more technical
sub-problems, such as data security and transparency. Among the many
autonomous systems on land, on water, under water, in air or space, we
discuss two samples: autonomous vehicles and autonomous weapons.</p>

<h4>2.7.1 Example (a) Autonomous Vehicles</h4>

<p>
Autonomous vehicles hold the promise to reduce the very significant
damage that human driving currently causes&mdash;approximately 1
million humans being killed per year, many more injured, the
environment polluted, earth sealed with concrete and tarmac, cities
full of parked cars, etc. However, there seem to be questions on how
autonomous vehicles should behave, and how responsibility and risk
should be distributed in the complicated system the vehicles operates
in. (There is also significant disagreement over how long the
development of fully autonomous, or &ldquo;level 5&rdquo; cars (SAE
International 2018) will actually take.)</p>

<p>
There is some discussion of &ldquo;trolley problems&rdquo; in this
context. In the classic &ldquo;trolley problems&rdquo; (Thomson 1976;
Woollard and Howard-Snyder 2016: section 2) various dilemmas are
presented. The simplest version is that of a trolley train on a track
that is heading towards five people and will kill them, unless the
train is diverted onto a side track, but on that track there is one
person, who will be killed if the train takes that side track. The
example goes back to a remark in (Foot 1967: 6), who discusses a
number of dilemma cases where tolerated and intended consequences of
an action differ. &ldquo;Trolley problems&rdquo; are not supposed to
describe actual ethical problems or to be solved with a
&ldquo;right&rdquo; choice. Rather, they are thought-experiments where
choice is artificially constrained to a small finite number of
distinct one-off options and where the agent has perfect knowledge.
These problems are used as a theoretical tool to investigate ethical
intuitions and theories&mdash;especially the difference between
actively doing vs. allowing something to happen, intended vs.
tolerated consequences, and consequentialist vs. other normative
approaches (Kamm 2016). This type of problem has reminded many of the
problems encountered in actual driving and in autonomous driving (Lin
2016). It is doubtful, however, that an actual driver or autonomous
car will ever have to solve trolley problems (but see Keeling 2020).
While autonomous car trolley problems have received a lot of media
attention (Awad et al. 2018), they do not seem to offer anything new
to either ethical theory or to the programming of autonomous
vehicles.</p>

<p>
The more common ethical problems in driving, such as speeding, risky
overtaking, not keeping a safe distance, etc. are classic problems of
pursuing personal interest vs. the common good. The vast majority of
these are covered by legal regulations on driving. Programming the car
to drive &ldquo;by the rules&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;by the interest
of the passengers&rdquo; or &ldquo;to achieve maximum utility&rdquo;
is thus deflated to a standard problem of programming ethical machines
(see
 <a href="#MachEthi">section 2.9</a>).
 There are probably additional discretionary rules of politeness and
interesting questions on when to break the rules (Lin 2016), but again
this seems to be more a case of applying standard considerations
(rules vs. utility) to the case of autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p>
Notable policy efforts in this field include the report (German
Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure 2017), which
stresses that <em>safety</em> is the primary objective. Rule 10 states
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In the case of automated and connected driving systems, the
accountability that was previously the sole preserve of the individual
shifts from the motorist to the manufacturers and operators of the
technological systems and to the bodies responsible for taking
infrastructure, policy and legal decisions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(See
 <a href="#RespForRobo">section 2.10.1</a>
 below). The resulting German and EU laws on licensing automated
driving are much more restrictive than their US counterparts where
&ldquo;testing on consumers&rdquo; is a strategy used by some
companies&mdash;without informed consent of the consumers or their
possible victims.</p>

<h4>2.7.2 Example (b) Autonomous Weapons</h4>

<p>
The notion of automated weapons is fairly old: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For example, instead of fielding simple guided missiles or remotely
piloted vehicles, we might launch completely autonomous land, sea, and
air vehicles capable of complex, far-ranging reconnaissance and attack
missions. (DARPA 1983: 1) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This proposal was ridiculed as &ldquo;fantasy&rdquo; at the time
(Dreyfus, Dreyfus, and Athanasiou 1986: ix), but it is now a reality,
at least for more easily identifiable targets (missiles, planes,
ships, tanks, etc.), but not for human combatants. The main arguments
against (lethal) autonomous weapon systems (AWS or LAWS), are that
they support extrajudicial killings, take responsibility away from
humans, and make wars or killings more likely&mdash;for a detailed
list of issues see Lin, Bekey, and Abney (2008: 73&ndash;86).</p>

<p>
It appears that lowering the hurdle to use such systems (autonomous
vehicles, &ldquo;fire-and-forget&rdquo; missiles, or drones loaded
with explosives) and reducing the probability of being held
accountable would increase the probability of their use. The crucial
asymmetry where one side can kill with impunity, and thus has few
reasons not to do so, already exists in conventional drone wars with
remote controlled weapons (e.g., US in Pakistan). It is easy to
imagine a small drone that searches, identifies, and kills an
individual human&mdash;or perhaps a type of human. These are the kinds
of cases brought forward by the <em>Campaign to Stop Killer
Robots</em> and other activist groups. Some seem to be equivalent to
saying that autonomous weapons are indeed weapons &hellip;, and
weapons kill, but we still make them in gigantic numbers. On the
matter of accountability, autonomous weapons might make identification
and prosecution of the responsible agents more difficult&mdash;but
this is not clear, given the digital records that one can keep, at
least in a conventional war. The difficulty of allocating punishment
is sometimes called the &ldquo;retribution gap&rdquo; (Danaher
2016a).</p>

<p>
Another question is whether using autonomous weapons in war would make
wars worse, or make wars less bad. If robots reduce war crimes and
crimes in war, the answer may well be positive and has been used as an
argument in favour of these weapons (Arkin 2009; M&uuml;ller 2016a)
but also as an argument against them (Amoroso and Tamburrini 2018).
Arguably the main threat is not the use of such weapons in
conventional warfare, but in asymmetric conflicts or by non-state
agents, including criminals.</p>

<p>
It has also been said that autonomous weapons cannot conform to
International Humanitarian Law, which requires observance of the
principles of distinction (between combatants and civilians),
proportionality (of force), and military necessity (of force) in
military conflict (A. Sharkey 2019). It is true that the distinction
between combatants and non-combatants is hard, but the distinction
between civilian and military ships is easy&mdash;so all this says is
that we should not construct and use such weapons if they do violate
Humanitarian Law. Additional concerns have been raised that being
killed by an autonomous weapon threatens human dignity, but even the
defenders of a ban on these weapons seem to say that these are not
good arguments: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There are other weapons, and other technologies, that also compromise
human dignity. Given this, and the ambiguities inherent in the
concept, it is wiser to draw on several types of objections in
arguments against AWS, and not to rely exclusively on human dignity.
(A. Sharkey 2019)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A lot has been made of keeping humans &ldquo;in the loop&rdquo; or
&ldquo;on the loop&rdquo; in the military guidance on
weapons&mdash;these ways of spelling out &ldquo;meaningful
control&rdquo; are discussed in (Santoni de Sio and van den Hoven
2018). There have been discussions about the difficulties of
allocating responsibility for the killings of an autonomous weapon,
and a &ldquo;responsibility gap&rdquo; has been suggested (esp. Rob
Sparrow 2007), meaning that neither the human nor the machine may be
responsible. On the other hand, we do not assume that for every event
there is someone responsible for that event, and the real issue may
well be the distribution of risk (Simpson and M&uuml;ller 2016). Risk
analysis (Hansson 2013) indicates it is crucial to identify who is
<em>exposed</em> to risk, who is a potential <em>beneficiary</em>, and
who makes the <em>decisions</em> (Hansson 2018: 1822&ndash;1824).</p>

<h3 id="MachEthi">2.8 Machine Ethics</h3>

<p>
Machine ethics is ethics for machines, for &ldquo;ethical
machines&rdquo;, for machines as <em>subjects</em>, rather than for
the human use of machines as <em>objects.</em> It is often not very
clear whether this is supposed to cover all of AI ethics or to be a
part of it (Floridi and Saunders 2004; Moor 2006; Anderson and
Anderson 2011; Wallach and Asaro 2017). Sometimes it looks as though
there is the (dubious) inference at play here that if machines act in
ethically relevant ways, then we need a machine ethics. Accordingly,
some use a broader notion: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
machine ethics is concerned with ensuring that the behavior of
machines toward human users, and perhaps other machines as well, is
ethically acceptable. (Anderson and Anderson 2007: 15) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This might include mere matters of product safety, for example. Other
authors sound rather ambitious but use a narrower notion: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
AI reasoning should be able to take into account societal values,
moral and ethical considerations; weigh the respective priorities of
values held by different stakeholders in various multicultural
contexts; explain its reasoning; and guarantee transparency. (Dignum
2018: 1, 2) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Some of the discussion in machine ethics makes the very substantial
assumption that machines can, in some sense, be ethical agents
responsible for their actions, or &ldquo;autonomous moral
agents&rdquo; (see van Wynsberghe and Robbins 2019). The basic idea of
machine ethics is now finding its way into actual robotics where the
assumption that these machines are artificial moral agents in any
substantial sense is usually not made (Winfield et al. 2019). It is
sometimes observed that a robot that is programmed to follow ethical
rules can very easily be modified to follow unethical rules
(Vanderelst and Winfield 2018).</p>

<p>
The idea that machine ethics might take the form of &ldquo;laws&rdquo;
has famously been investigated by Isaac Asimov, who proposed
&ldquo;three laws of robotics&rdquo; (Asimov 1942): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
First Law&mdash;A robot may not injure a human being or, through
inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Second Law&mdash;A
robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such
orders would conflict with the First Law. Third Law&mdash;A robot must
protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict
with the First or Second Laws. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Asimov then showed in a number of stories how conflicts between these
three laws will make it problematic to use them despite their
hierarchical organisation.</p>

<p>
It is not clear that there is a consistent notion of &ldquo;machine
ethics&rdquo; since weaker versions are in danger of reducing
&ldquo;having an ethics&rdquo; to notions that would not normally be
considered sufficient (e.g., without &ldquo;reflection&rdquo; or even
without &ldquo;action&rdquo;); stronger notions that move towards
artificial moral agents may describe a&mdash;currently&mdash;empty
set.</p>

<h3 id="ArtiMoraAgen">2.9 Artificial Moral Agents</h3>

<p>

 <a name="_2jxsxqh"></a>If
 one takes machine ethics to concern moral agents, in some substantial
sense, then these agents can be called &ldquo;artificial moral
agents&rdquo;, having rights and responsibilities. However, the
discussion about artificial entities challenges a number of common
notions in ethics and it can be very useful to understand these in
abstraction from the human case (cf. Misselhorn 2020; Powers and
Ganascia forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Several authors use &ldquo;artificial moral agent&rdquo; in a less
demanding sense, borrowing from the use of &ldquo;agent&rdquo; in
software engineering in which case matters of responsibility and
rights will not arise (Allen, Varner, and Zinser 2000). James Moor
(2006) distinguishes four types of machine agents: ethical impact
agents (e.g., robot jockeys), implicit ethical agents (e.g., safe
autopilot), explicit ethical agents (e.g., using formal methods to
estimate utility), and full ethical agents (who &ldquo;can make
explicit ethical judgments and generally is competent to reasonably
justify them. An average adult human is a full ethical agent&rdquo;.)
Several ways to achieve &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; or &ldquo;full&rdquo;
ethical agents have been proposed, via programming it in (operational
morality), via &ldquo;developing&rdquo; the ethics itself (functional
morality), and finally full-blown morality with full intelligence and
sentience (Allen, Smit, and Wallach 2005; Moor 2006). Programmed
agents are sometimes not considered &ldquo;full&rdquo; agents because
they are &ldquo;competent without comprehension&rdquo;, just like the
neurons in a brain (Dennett 2017; Hakli and M&auml;kel&auml;
2019).</p>

<p>
In some discussions, the notion of &ldquo;moral patient&rdquo; plays a
role: Ethical <em>agents</em> have responsibilities while ethical
<em>patients</em> have rights because harm to them matters. It seems
clear that some entities are patients without being agents, e.g.,
simple animals that can feel pain but cannot make justified choices.
On the other hand, it is normally understood that all agents will also
be patients (e.g., in a Kantian framework). Usually, being a person is
supposed to be what makes an entity a responsible agent, someone who
can have duties and be the object of ethical concerns. Such
personhood is typically a deep notion associated with phenomenal consciousness, intention and free will (Frankfurt 1971; Strawson 1998). Torrance (2011) suggests &ldquo;artificial (or machine)
ethics could be defined as designing machines that do things that,
when done by humans, are indicative of the possession of
&lsquo;ethical status&rsquo; in those humans&rdquo; (2011:
116)&mdash;which he takes to be &ldquo;ethical <em>productivity</em>
and ethical <em>receptivity</em>&rdquo; (2011: 117)&mdash;his
expressions for moral agents and patients.</p>

<h4 id="RespForRobo">2.9.1 Responsibility for Robots</h4>

<p>
There is broad consensus that accountability, liability, and the rule
of law are basic requirements that must be upheld in the face of new
technologies (European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies
2018, 18), but the issue in the case of robots is how this can be done
and how responsibility can be allocated. If the robots act, will they
themselves be responsible, liable, or accountable for their actions?
Or should the distribution of risk perhaps take precedence over
discussions of responsibility?</p>

<p>
Traditional distribution of responsibility already occurs: A car maker
is responsible for the technical safety of the car, a driver is
responsible for driving, a mechanic is responsible for proper
maintenance, the public authorities are responsible for the technical
conditions of the roads, etc. In general </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The effects of decisions or actions based on AI are often the result
of countless interactions among many actors, including designers,
developers, users, software, and hardware.&hellip; With distributed
agency comes distributed responsibility. (Taddeo and Floridi 2018:
751). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
How this distribution might occur is not a problem that is specific to
AI, but it gains particular urgency in this context (Nyholm 2018a,
2018b). In classical control engineering, distributed control is often
achieved through a control hierarchy plus control loops across these
hierarchies.</p>

<h4>2.9.2 Rights for Robots</h4>

<p>
Some authors have indicated that it should be seriously considered
whether current robots must be allocated rights (Gunkel 2018a, 2018b;
Danaher forthcoming; Turner 2019). This position seems to rely largely
on criticism of the opponents and on the empirical observation that
robots and other non-persons are sometimes treated as having rights.
In this vein, a &ldquo;relational turn&rdquo; has been proposed: If we
relate to robots as though they had rights, then we might be
well-advised not to search whether they &ldquo;really&rdquo; do have
such rights (Coeckelbergh 2010, 2012, 2018). This raises the question
how far such anti-realism or quasi-realism can go, and what it means
then to say that &ldquo;robots have rights&rdquo; in a human-centred
approach (Gerdes 2016). On the other side of the debate, Bryson has
insisted that robots should not enjoy rights (Bryson 2010), though she
considers it a possibility (Gunkel and Bryson 2014).</p>

<p>
There is a wholly separate issue whether robots (or other AI systems)
should be given the status of &ldquo;legal entities&rdquo; or
&ldquo;legal persons&rdquo; in a sense natural persons, but also
states, businesses, or organisations are &ldquo;entities&rdquo;,
namely they can have legal rights and duties. The European Parliament
has considered allocating such status to robots in order to deal with
civil liability (EU Parliament 2016; Bertolini and Aiello 2018), but
not criminal liability&mdash;which is reserved for natural persons. It
would also be possible to assign only a certain subset of rights and
duties to robots. It has been said that &ldquo;such legislative action
would be morally unnecessary and legally troublesome&rdquo; because it
would not serve the interest of humans (Bryson, Diamantis, and Grant
2017: 273). In environmental ethics there is a long-standing
discussion about the legal rights for natural objects like trees (C.
D. Stone 1972).</p>

<p>
It has also been said that the reasons for developing robots with
rights, or artificial moral patients, in the future are ethically
doubtful (van Wynsberghe and Robbins 2019). In the community of
&ldquo;artificial consciousness&rdquo; researchers there is a
significant concern whether it would be ethical to create such
consciousness since creating it would presumably imply ethical
obligations to a sentient being, e.g., not to harm it and not to end
its existence by switching it off&mdash;some authors have called for a
&ldquo;moratorium on synthetic phenomenology&rdquo; (Bentley et al.
2018: 28f).</p>

<h3 id="Sing">2.10 Singularity</h3>

<h4>2.10.1 Singularity and Superintelligence</h4>

<p>
In some quarters, the aim of current AI is thought to be an
&ldquo;artificial general intelligence&rdquo; (AGI), contrasted to a
technical or &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; AI. AGI is usually distinguished
from traditional notions of AI as a general purpose system, and from
Searle&rsquo;s notion of &ldquo;strong AI&rdquo;: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
computers given the right programs can be literally said to
<em>understand</em> and have other cognitive states. (Searle 1980:
417)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idea of <em>singularity</em> is that if the trajectory of
artificial intelligence reaches up to systems that have a human level
of intelligence, then these systems would themselves have the ability
to develop AI systems that surpass the human level of intelligence,
i.e., they are &ldquo;superintelligent&rdquo; (see below). Such
superintelligent AI systems would quickly self-improve or develop even
more intelligent systems. This sharp turn of events after reaching
superintelligent AI is the &ldquo;singularity&rdquo; from which the
development of AI is out of human control and hard to predict
(Kurzweil 2005: 487).</p>

<p>
The fear that &ldquo;the robots we created will take over the
world&rdquo; had captured human imagination even before there were
computers (e.g., Butler 1863) and is the central theme in
&#268;apek&rsquo;s famous play that introduced the word
&ldquo;robot&rdquo; (&#268;apek 1920). This fear was first formulated
as a possible trajectory of existing AI into an &ldquo;intelligence
explosion&rdquo; by Irvin Good: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far
surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever.
Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities,
an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there
would then unquestionably be an &ldquo;intelligence explosion&rdquo;,
and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first
ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever
make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to
keep it under control. (Good 1965: 33)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The optimistic argument from acceleration to singularity is spelled
out by Kurzweil (1999, 2005, 2012) who essentially points out that
computing power has been increasing exponentially, i.e., doubling ca.
every 2 years since 1970 in accordance with &ldquo;Moore&rsquo;s
Law&rdquo; on the number of transistors, and will continue to do so
for some time in the future. He predicted in (Kurzweil 1999) that by
2010 supercomputers will reach human computation capacity, by 2030
&ldquo;mind uploading&rdquo; will be possible, and by 2045 the
&ldquo;singularity&rdquo; will occur. Kurzweil talks about an increase
in computing power that can be purchased at a given cost&mdash;but of
course in recent years the funds available to AI companies have also
increased enormously: Amodei and Hernandez (2018 [OIR]) thus estimate that
in the years 2012&ndash;2018 the actual computing power available to
train a particular AI system doubled every 3.4 months, resulting in an
300,000x increase&mdash;not the 7x increase that doubling every two
years would have created.</p>

<p>
A common version of this argument (Chalmers 2010) talks about an
increase in &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; of the AI system (rather than
raw computing power), but the crucial point of
&ldquo;singularity&rdquo; remains the one where further development of
AI is taken over by AI systems and accelerates beyond human level.
Bostrom (2014) explains in some detail what would happen at that point
and what the risks for humanity are. The discussion is summarised in
Eden et al. (2012); Armstrong (2014); Shanahan (2015). There are
possible paths to superintelligence other than computing power
increase, e.g., the complete emulation of the human brain on a
computer (Kurzweil 2012; Sandberg 2013), biological paths, or networks
and organisations (Bostrom 2014: 22&ndash;51).</p>

<p>
Despite obvious weaknesses in the identification of
&ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; with processing power, Kurzweil seems right
that humans tend to underestimate the power of exponential growth.
Mini-test: If you walked in steps in such a way that each step is
double the previous, starting with a step of one metre, how far would
you get with 30 steps? (answer: almost 3 times further than the
Earth&rsquo;s only permanent natural satellite.) Indeed, most progress
in AI is readily attributable to the availability of processors that
are faster by degrees of magnitude, larger storage, and higher
investment (M&uuml;ller 2018). The actual acceleration and its speeds
are discussed in (M&uuml;ller and Bostrom 2016; Bostrom, Dafoe, and
Flynn forthcoming); Sandberg (2019) argues that progress will continue
for some time.</p>

<p>
The participants in this debate are united by being technophiles in
the sense that they expect technology to develop rapidly and bring
broadly welcome changes&mdash;but beyond that, they divide into those
who focus on benefits (e.g., Kurzweil) and those who focus on risks
(e.g., Bostrom). Both camps sympathise with &ldquo;transhuman&rdquo;
views of survival for humankind in a different physical form, e.g.,
uploaded on a computer (Moravec 1990, 1998; Bostrom 2003a, 2003c).
They also consider the prospects of &ldquo;human enhancement&rdquo; in
various respects, including intelligence&mdash;often called
&ldquo;IA&rdquo; (intelligence augmentation). It may be that future AI
will be used for human enhancement, or will contribute further to the
dissolution of the neatly defined human single person. Robin Hanson
provides detailed speculation about what will happen economically in
case human &ldquo;brain emulation&rdquo; enables truly intelligent
robots or &ldquo;ems&rdquo; (Hanson 2016).</p>

<p>
The argument from superintelligence to risk requires the assumption
that superintelligence does not imply benevolence&mdash;contrary to
Kantian traditions in ethics that have argued higher levels of
rationality or intelligence would go along with a better understanding
of what is moral and better ability to act morally (Gewirth 1978;
Chalmers 2010: 36f). Arguments for risk from superintelligence say
that rationality and morality are entirely independent
dimensions&mdash;this is sometimes explicitly argued for as an
&ldquo;orthogonality thesis&rdquo; (Bostrom 2012; Armstrong 2013;
Bostrom 2014: 105&ndash;109).</p>

<p>
Criticism of the singularity narrative has been raised from various
angles. Kurzweil and Bostrom seem to assume that intelligence is a
one-dimensional property and that the set of intelligent agents is
totally-ordered in the mathematical sense&mdash;but neither discusses
intelligence at any length in their books. Generally, it is fair to
say that despite some efforts, the assumptions made in the powerful
narrative of superintelligence and singularity have not been
investigated in detail. One question is whether such a singularity
will ever occur&mdash;it may be conceptually impossible, practically
impossible or may just not happen because of contingent events,
including people actively preventing it. Philosophically, the
interesting question is whether singularity is just a
&ldquo;myth&rdquo; (Floridi 2016; Ganascia 2017), and not on the
trajectory of actual AI research. This is something that practitioners
often assume (e.g., Brooks 2017 [OIR]). They may do so because they fear the
public relations backlash, because they overestimate the practical
problems, or because they have good reasons to think that
superintelligence is an unlikely outcome of current AI research
(M&uuml;ller forthcoming-a). This discussion raises the question
whether the concern about &ldquo;singularity&rdquo; is just a
narrative about fictional AI based on human fears. But even if one
<em>does</em> find negative reasons compelling and the singularity not
likely to occur, there is still a significant possibility that one may
turn out to be wrong. Philosophy is not on the &ldquo;secure path of a
science&rdquo; (Kant 1791: B15), and maybe AI and robotics
aren&rsquo;t either (M&uuml;ller 2020). So, it appears that discussing
the very high-impact risk of singularity has justification <em>even
if</em> one thinks the probability of such singularity ever occurring
is very low.</p>

<h4>2.10.2 Existential Risk from Superintelligence</h4>

<p>
Thinking about superintelligence in the long term raises the question
whether superintelligence may lead to the extinction of the human
species, which is called an &ldquo;existential risk&rdquo; (or XRisk):
The superintelligent systems may well have preferences that conflict
with the existence of humans on Earth, and may thus decide to end that
existence&mdash;and given their superior intelligence, they will have
the power to do so (or they may happen to end it because they do not
really care).</p>

<p>
Thinking in the long term is the crucial feature of this literature.
Whether the singularity (or another catastrophic event) occurs in 30
or 300 or 3000 years does not really matter (Baum et al. 2019).
Perhaps there is even an astronomical pattern such that an intelligent
species is bound to discover AI at some point, and thus bring about
its own demise. Such a &ldquo;great filter&rdquo; would contribute to
the explanation of the &ldquo;Fermi paradox&rdquo; why there is no
sign of life in the known universe despite the high probability of it
emerging. It would be bad news if we found out that the &ldquo;great
filter&rdquo; is ahead of us, rather than an obstacle that Earth has
already passed. These issues are sometimes taken more narrowly to be
about human extinction (Bostrom 2013), or more broadly as concerning
any large risk for the species (Rees 2018)&mdash;of which AI is only
one (H&auml;ggstr&ouml;m 2016; Ord 2020). Bostrom also uses the
category of &ldquo;global catastrophic risk&rdquo; for risks that are
sufficiently high up the two dimensions of &ldquo;scope&rdquo; and
&ldquo;severity&rdquo; (Bostrom and &#262;irkovi&#263; 2011; Bostrom
2013).</p>

<p>
These discussions of risk are usually not connected to the general
problem of ethics under risk (e.g., Hansson 2013, 2018). The long-term
view has its own methodological challenges but has produced a wide
discussion: (Tegmark 2017) focuses on AI and human life
&ldquo;3.0&rdquo; after singularity while Russell, Dewey, and Tegmark
(2015) and Bostrom, Dafoe, and Flynn (forthcoming) survey longer-term
policy issues in ethical AI. Several collections of papers have
investigated the risks of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and
the factors that might make this development more or less risk-laden
(M&uuml;ller 2016b; Callaghan et al. 2017; Yampolskiy 2018), including
the development of non-agent AI (Drexler 2019).</p>

<h4>2.10.3 Controlling Superintelligence?</h4>

<p>
In a narrow sense, the &ldquo;control problem&rdquo; is how we humans
can remain in control of an AI system once it is superintelligent
(Bostrom 2014: 127ff). In a wider sense, it is the problem of how we
can make sure an AI system will turn out to be positive according to
human perception (Russell 2019); this is sometimes called &ldquo;value
alignment&rdquo;. How easy or hard it is to control a
superintelligence depends significantly on the speed of
&ldquo;take-off&rdquo; to a superintelligent system. This has led to
particular attention to systems with self-improvement, such as
AlphaZero (Silver et al. 2018).</p>

<p>
One aspect of this problem is that we might decide a certain feature
is desirable, but then find out that it has unforeseen consequences
that are so negative that we would not desire that feature after all.
This is the ancient problem of King Midas who wished that all he
touched would turn into gold. This problem has been discussed on the
occasion of various examples, such as the &ldquo;paperclip
maximiser&rdquo; (Bostrom 2003b), or the program to optimise chess
performance (Omohundro 2014).</p>

<p>
Discussions about superintelligence include speculation about
omniscient beings, the radical changes on a &ldquo;latter day&rdquo;,
and the promise of immortality through transcendence of our current
bodily form&mdash;so sometimes they have clear religious undertones
(Capurro 1993; Geraci 2008, 2010; O&rsquo;Connell 2017: 160ff). These
issues also pose a well-known problem of epistemology: Can we know the
ways of the omniscient (Danaher 2015)? The usual opponents have
already shown up: A characteristic response of an atheist is </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the
world, but the real problem is that they&rsquo;re too stupid and
they&rsquo;ve already taken over the world (Domingos 2015) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The new nihilists explain that a &ldquo;techno-hypnosis&rdquo; through
information technologies has now become our main method of distraction
from the loss of meaning (Gertz 2018). Both opponents would thus say
we need an ethics for the &ldquo;small&rdquo; problems that occur with
actual AI and robotics 
 (<a href="#MainDeba">sections 2.1 through 2.9</a> above), 
 and that there is less need for the &ldquo;big ethics&rdquo; of
existential risk from AI (<a href="#Sing">section 2.10</a>).</p>
 

<h2 id="Clos">3. Closing</h2>

<p>
The singularity thus raises the problem of the concept of AI again. It
is remarkable how imagination or &ldquo;vision&rdquo; has played a
central role since the very beginning of the discipline at the
&ldquo;Dartmouth Summer Research Project&rdquo; (McCarthy et al. 1955 [OIR];
Simon and Newell 1958). And the evaluation of this vision is subject
to dramatic change: In a few decades, we went from the slogans
&ldquo;AI is impossible&rdquo; (Dreyfus 1972) and &ldquo;AI is just
automation&rdquo; (Lighthill 1973) to &ldquo;AI will solve all
problems&rdquo; (Kurzweil 1999) and &ldquo;AI may kill us all&rdquo;
(Bostrom 2014). This created media attention and public relations
efforts, but it also raises the problem of how much of this
&ldquo;philosophy and ethics of AI&rdquo; is really about AI rather
than about an imagined technology. As we said at the outset, AI and
robotics have raised fundamental questions about what we should do
with these systems, what the systems themselves should do, and what
risks they have in the long term. They also challenge the human view
of humanity as the intelligent and dominant species on Earth. We have
seen issues that have been raised and will have to watch technological
and social developments closely to catch the new issues early on,
develop a philosophical analysis, and learn for traditional problems
of philosophy.</p>

Early drafts of this article were discussed with colleagues at the
IDEA Centre of the University of Leeds, some friends, and my PhD
students Michael Cannon, Zach Gudmunsen, Gabriela Arrieagada-Bruneau
and Charlotte Stix. Later drafts were made publicly available on the
Internet and publicised via Twitter and e-mail to all (then) cited
authors that I could locate. These later drafts were presented to
audiences at the INBOTS Project Meeting (Reykjavik 2019), the Computer
Science Department Colloquium (Leeds 2019), the European Robotics
Forum (Bucharest 2019), the AI Lunch and the Philosophy &amp; Ethics
group (Eindhoven 2019)&mdash;many thanks for their comments.</p>

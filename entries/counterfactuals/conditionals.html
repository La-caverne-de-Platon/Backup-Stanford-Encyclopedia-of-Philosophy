<h2>A. Indicative and Subjunctive Conditionals</h2>

<p>
Historically, many philosophers have been tempted to assume that
indicatives and subjunctives involve entirely different conditional
connectives with related but substantially different meanings <span class="citation">(D.
Lewis 1973b; Gibbard 1980; Jackson 1987; J.
Bennett 2003)</span>. This may be justifiable as an analytic
convenience: one can use it to focus, as we are here, on two different
complex constructions involving <em>if</em>, tense, aspect, and
modality, e.g., simple past conditionals vs. past perfect
<em>would</em>-conditionals. But at a fully detailed level of
analysis, there is no lexical ambiguity of <em>if</em>&rsquo;s. There
are just different effects produced by the elements with which
<em>if</em> interacts. It might even turn out that there is no
accurate binary semantic distinction between types of conditionals
<span class="citation">(Dudman
 1988a)</span>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-45" id="ref-45">45</a>]</sup>
 This is just to accept a minimal version of compositionality, the
fact that different conditionals contain crucially different
components and the fact that <em>if</em> is not
 homonymous.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-46" id="ref-46">46</a>]</sup>
 Recent work in compositional semantics and pragmatics has offered
sophisticated and connected explanations of the differences between
various conditionals. Of most relevance here is the work on the
difference between simple past and past perfect <em>would</em>
conditionals. Even this subregion of the literature is too rich to
fully detail here, but the main issue and positions will be
summarized.</p>

<p>
As in
 <a href="index-2.html#e-ind-bob">(5)</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#e-subj-bob">(6)</a>,
 simple past conditionals (&ldquo;indicatives&rdquo;) do not admit of
a counterfactual use, but past perfect <em>would</em> conditionals
(&ldquo;subjunctives&rdquo;) do. <span class="citation">Stalnaker
(1975)</span> proposed that indicative antecedents evoke possibilities
compatible with what&rsquo;s being assumed in the discourse, while
subjunctives antecedents signal that no such assumption is being made.
But this does not answer the key question: how can this difference be
linked to the different morphology found in the two constructions? The
two leading hypotheses begin with the observation that past tense
marking in subjunctives does not receive its expected interpretation.
The antecedent may be coherently supplemented with <em>tomorrow</em>
to yield an antecedent that concerns a possibly counterfactual
<em>future</em>
 event.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-47" id="ref-47">47</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">

<dt id="e-fake-past">(52)</dt><dd>Bob
died yesterday. If he had died \(\textbf{tomorrow}\)
instead, he would have been 98 years old.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
As evidenced by
 <a href="#e-ppnb">(54)</a>,
 this is not possible for a genuinely past tense reading of <em>Bob
had died</em>, like that in
 <a href="#e-ppn">(53)</a>.</p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag3em">

<dt id="e-ppn">(53)</dt><dd>Yesterday
I went to the Black Lodge. By the time I got
there, Bob had died, but Cooper hadn't.</dd>

<dt id="e-ppnb">(54)</dt><dd>I will
go to the Black Lodge tomorrow. # By the time I get there, Bob had
died, but Cooper hadn't.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This phenomenon does not occur with indicatives, and some have
highlighted it as the dividing line between indicatives and
subjunctives <span class="citation">(Ippolito 2013:
 2)</span>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-48" id="ref-48">48</a>]</sup></p>
 
<dl class="sentag tag3em">

<dt id="e-pib">(55)</dt><dd># If Bob
danced tomorrow, Leland danced tomorrow.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
This observation has generated two hypotheses. The first is:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Past as Remote Modality</strong> The past tense in
subjunctives serves a modal function rather than a temporal one: it
signals that the possibility described by the antecedent is not
assumed to be among those regarded as actual in the discourse. <span class="citation">(Isard
1974; Lyons 1977; Palmer 1986; Iatridou 2000;
Schulz 2007, 2014; Starr 2014)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
There is actually some disagreement about the exact content of the
Past as Remote Modality hypothesis, but the above is the weakest
 version.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-49" id="ref-49">49</a>]</sup>
 This neatly explains why subjunctives can have a counterfactual use,
but needn&rsquo;t be counterfactual. It also explains the intuition
that subjunctives are logically stronger than indicatives: if it is
appropriate to assert both, then the indicative follows from the
subjunctive. It also generalizes more easily to languages which use a
form for subjunctives that is unrelated to past tense. <span class="citation">Schulz
(2007, 2014)</span> and <span class="citation">Starr
(2014)</span> aim to address a gap in Past as
Remote Modality analyses: they are not typically presented in a
rigorous formal semantics. Past as Remote Modality approaches also
inherit the responsibility of explaining why past tense would take on
this modal meaning in these contexts. <span class="citation">Iatridou
(2000)</span> proposes that remote modality and past tense have a
common semantic feature: they express something about a topic that is
remote from the perspective of the current discourse. This leaves room
for a theory on which there is a single meaning that covers both uses,
but that is refined to the modal use in conditional contexts. <span class="citation">Schulz
(2014)</span> develops a polysemous account
where the past tense in subjunctives contributes a distinct modal
operator arises from the diachronic process of
 re-categorization.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-50" id="ref-50">50</a>]</sup>
 The alternative hypothesis about past tense in subjunctives is
this:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Past Modality</strong> The past tense in subjunctives
modifies the modality rather than the time at which antecedent and
consequent hold: it conveys what was possible/necessary in the past
<span class="citation">(Adams 1976; Skyrms 1981; Tedeschi 1981; Dudman
1984a,b; Arregui 2007, 2009; Ippolito 2006, 2008, 2013; Khoo
2015)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Past Modality approaches inherit no such responsibility because they
find room for a normal past tense meaning by allowing for it to
operate on the modality expressed, rather than the events described by
the conditional. This approach begins with the idea that what&rsquo;s
possible is a function of time: what&rsquo;s possible now is very
different than what was possible at a prior point in history. For
example, <span class="citation">Tedeschi (1981)</span> thinks of each
event as a branch point that distinguishes one world from another. At
the present time in the actual world, certain branches are open, but
certain branches had to have been taken to have ended up here, now.
The past tense in a subjunctive can then move one back to any salient
earlier branch point and express generalizations about the branches
open from there. However, from that past time, there will still be
facts about what happens tomorrow. So, while the past tense changes
the sense of possibility at play, adverbs like <em>tomorrow</em> can
still refer to our current future, they just do so from a shifted
modal perspective.</p>

<p>
On the Past Modality approach, counterfactual uses are made possible
by the assumption that something which is now impossible may have once
been possible. Of course, non-counterfactual uses are also
accommodated: one may want to describe what was possible at a past
point in our timeline. Another crucial detail for Past Modality
approaches is the treatment of simple past indicative conditionals.
They are analyzed as a species of epistemic modality about a past
event rather than historical modality <span class="citation">(Tedeschi
1981; Arregui 2007; Ippolito 2013)</span>. This is needed to explain
the truth-conditional differences between subjunctives and
indicatives, e.g.,
 <a href="index-2.html#e-ind-kennedy">(3)</a>/<a href="index-2.html#e-subj-kennedy">(4)</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Past Modality theories require the logical form of subjunctives to
depart from its surface form: tense must take scope over the
conditional. Various plausible ways of working this out have been
explored <span class="citation">(Tedeschi 1981; Arregui 2007; Ippolito
2013)</span>. A more significant concern arises from hindsight
counterfactuals such as
 <a href="#e-hindsight">(56)</a>.
 </p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">

<dt id="e-hindsight">(56)</dt><dd>You
have been offered a $1 bet on the outcome of a fair
coin toss. You decline. The coin is flipped and comes up heads. If
you had bet heads, you would have won $1.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Intuitively, the counterfactual is true. But, it is hard to see how
this can be true on a past modality approach <span class="citation">(Barker
1998; Edgington 2004; Schulz 2007)</span>. If
one goes back to a time before the coin flip, it seems unlikely that
on even most of the branches where you bet, the coin toss comes out
the way it actually does. But then you wouldn&rsquo;t have won $1, and
the counterfactual would be false. <span class="citation">Ippolito
(2013: &sect;3.6)</span> offers a Past Modality approach designed to
address this issue. Another potential issue arises with epistemic uses
of counterfactuals like the following one from <span class="citation">Hansson
 1989</span>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-51" id="ref-51">51</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
Suppose that one night you approach a small town of which you know
that it has exactly two snack bars. Just before entering the town you
meet a man eating a hamburger. You have good reason to accept the
following conditional:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">

<dt id="e-h1">(57)</dt><dd>If snack
bar <i>A</i> is closed, snack bar <i>B</i> is open</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Suppose now that after entering the town and seeing the man with the
burger, you see that <i>A</i> is in fact open. I comment on how lucky
we are that this one is open. You temper my enthusiasm by reminding
me:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">

<dt id="e-h2">(58)</dt><dd>If snack
bar <i>A</i> had been closed, snack bar <i>B</i> would have been
open</dd>
</dl>

<p>

 <a href="#e-h2">(57)</a>
 appears to be a counterfactual conditional about the past, but which
expresses something about our present epistemic state: there&rsquo;s
no temptation to read it as claiming that the closure of snack bar
<i>B</i> caused <i>A</i> to be open. This challenges the assumption
Past Modality approaches rely on to distinguish subjunctives from
simple past indicatives: only simple past indicatives express
something about our present information about past events.
Incidentally, these epistemic counterfactuals are also a difficult
case for many philosophical theories which aim to identify the
indicative/subjunctive distinction with the epistemic/metaphysical
modality distinction, e.g., <span class="citation">Weatherson
(2001)</span>. For more on the distinction between epistemic and
metaphysical modality, see
 <a href="../modality-varieties/index.html">Varieties of Modality</a>.</p>

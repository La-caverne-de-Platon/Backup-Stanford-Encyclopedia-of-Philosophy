<h2>Problems for Wide-Scoping</h2>

<p>When we combine the view that one ought to be instrumentally coherent
 as such with the wide-scope formulation of the rational requirement, it
 doesn't follow, in our example, that one ought to kill one's rival. 
Rather, it only follows that one ought to either revise the intention to
 stay in power, or revise the belief that one will do so only if one 
intends to kill one's rival, or intend to kill one's rival.</p>

<h3><a name="1">1. Unalterable Ends and Transmission</a></h3>

<p>But now suppose that you are unable to alter your intention to stay 
in power and unable to alter your instrumental belief.  So, the only way
 you can comply with the wide-scope ought&mdash;the claim that you ought to 
either revise the intention to stay in power, or revise the belief that 
you'll do so only if you intend to kill your rival, or intend to kill 
your rival&mdash;is by intending to kill your rival.  In other words, 
intending to kill your rival is a necessary means for complying with the
 wide-scope ought.  If we apply the transmission principle:</p>

<dl><dt>Ought Necessity:</dt><dd> If one ought to <i>E</i>,
and <i>M</i> is a necessary means to <i>E</i>-ing, then one ought
to <i>M</i>.</dd></dl>

<p>then we get the result that you ought to intend to kill your rival.  
The wide-scope strategy is thus also unable to avoid this implausible 
result when ends and means-end beliefs are unalterable.  (See Setiya 
2007, who draws upon Greenspan 1975.  See also Schroeder 2009 and Bedke 
2009).</p>

<p>A similar problem would arise if we say that there is <em>a reason</em>
 to be instrumentally coherent.  Suppose we say that there is a reason 
to either revise the intention to stay in power or revise the belief 
that one will do so only if one intends to kill one's rival, or intend 
to kill one's rival.  Now suppose that both the end and belief are 
unalterable, and we apply a similar transmission principle:</p>

<dl><dt>Weak Reasons Necessity:</dt><dd> If one has reason
to <i>E</i>, and <i>M</i> is a necessary means to <i>E</i>-ing, then
that is some reason to <i>M</i>.  (Variations on this principle are
defended in Bratman 2009c, &sect;5 and Schroeder 2009,
&sect;5.) </dd></dl>

<p>We then get the implausible result that there is a reason to intend 
to kill one's rival.  (If we accept Strong Reasons Necessity, then this 
transmitted reason to intend to kill one's rival would be at least as 
strong as the reason to be instrumentally rational.)</p>

<p>One could respond to these arguments by challenging the relevant
transmission principles  (see the discussion
in <a href="index-2.html#InsTra">&sect;2</a> of the main text, and see Way
2010).  Another strategy of response would be to argue that when one's
ends and beliefs are unalterable, the reason to be instrumentally
coherent is no longer in place.  If that reason is no longer in place,
then there is no reason to be transmitted, and hence no implausible
result would follow from the application of a transmission principle.
Bratman (2009c) presents an argument along these lines.  In Bratman's
view, we have a reason to be instrumentally coherent only because we
have a reason to be self-governing.  But when one is no longer capable
of revising one's ends, one is no longer capable of self-governance in
that domain.  Hence, the reason to be instrumentally coherent
disappears.</p>

<p>Bratman acknowledges that there are two potential difficulties
facing such a strategy.  First, even if it's true that the reason to
be instrumentally coherent disappears in such cases, the rational
requirement to be instrumentally coherent does not.  So, this strategy
involves conceding that there are some cases in which one does not
have a reason to be instrumentally coherent.  Second, it's not clear
that an inability to revise one's ends always makes one incapable of
self-governance.  For instance, suppose that one is <em>unaware</em>
that one is unable to revise one's ends, but, after careful reflection
and deliberation, one decides to intend the means.  That seems to
involve self-governance.  So, self-governance is possible here.  But
that means, on Bratman's view, there <em>would</em> be a reason to be
instrumentally coherent that would transmit, yielding the implausible
result (Brunero 2010). </p>

<h3>2. Reasons for Disjunctions and Transmission</h3>

<p>
Joseph Raz argues that if one ought, or even just has a reason, to
bring about a disjunctive state of affairs&mdash;that is, to bring it
about that either <i>P</i> or <i>Q</i>&mdash;then one has a reason to
bring it about that <i>P</i> and a reason to bring it about
that <i>Q</i>.  He argues that &ldquo;[p]eople have reason to do what
will bring them into conformity with reasons that apply to them&rdquo;
(Raz 2005a, 3).  (This is roughly equivalent to Weak Reasons
Sufficiency, formulated in <a href="index-2.html#InsTra">&sect;2</a> of
the main text.)  Since bringing it about that <i>P</i> will bring it
about that one conforms to the reason one has to bring it about that
either <i>P</i> or <i>Q</i>, one has a reason to bring it about
that <i>P</i>.  And, by the same reasoning, one has a reason to bring
it about that <i>Q</i>. </p>

<p>So, if we say that one ought, or has a reason, to bring it about that
 either one doesn't intend to stay in power, or one doesn't believe 
intending to kill one's rival is necessary to stay in power, or one 
intends to kill one's rival, then it follows that one has a reason for 
each disjunct.  In particular, it follows that one has a reason to 
intend to kill one's rival.  And this seems implausible (see Bedke 
2009, &sect;2.a).  So, the combination of Raz's transmission principle with 
the thesis that one ought, or has reason, to be instrumentally coherent 
yields an implausible result. </p>

<p>Raz's transmission principle can be challenged.  The counterexample
to Weak Reasons Sufficiency (in <a href="index-2.html#RatCohRea">&sect;1</a> of
the main text) applies to it: suppose you have a reason to alleviate
pangs of hunger and there are two ways to do this: eating the sandwich
or killing yourself.  It follows from Raz's principle that you have a
reason to kill yourself (Broome 2005b). (See also Way 2010 and Rippon
2011 for critical discussion of Raz's transmission principle.)  </p>

<p>One could respond by accepting the allegedly implausible result
that one has a reason to kill oneself  (Raz 2005a; Bedke 2009). And,
as we noted in <a href="index-2.html#InsTra">&sect;2</a> of the main text,
there may be a pragmatic explanation of why it sounds odd to say that
there is a reason to kill oneself.  Why bother to identify any reason
to kill oneself when it is vastly outweighed by the reasons against
doing so?  (Raz 2005a; Schroeder 2005a, 2007).</p>

<p>A problem with this response, however, is that it would work equally 
well in defense of the claim that one has a reason to be instrumentally 
rational.  Recall that the supposed problem here was that if there is a 
reason to be instrumentally rational, and Raz's transmission principle 
is correct, then it follows that the person who intends to stay in 
power, believes intending to kill his rival is necessary to do so, but 
doesn't intend to kill his rival, would have a reason to intend to kill 
his rival.  But one could equally well accept this conclusion, emphasize
 that the reason here is greatly outweighed, and appeal to the 
pragmatics of reasons discourse to explain why it sounds odd to say 
there is such a reason (Schroeder 2005a). </p>

<h3>3. Symmetry</h3>

<p>The wide-scope interpretation of instrumental coherence is also 
subject to objections independently of its combination with the thesis 
that one ought, or has reason, to be instrumentally coherent.  One 
objection concerns the &ldquo;symmetry&rdquo; among ways of escaping from 
instrumental incoherence on the wide-scope account.  There are three 
ways an instrumentally incoherent agent could come to comply with the 
wide-scope requirement: by intending the means, by dropping the end, or 
by abandoning the belief that intending the means is necessary for 
achieving the end.  Proceeding in any of these ways would bring an 
incoherent agent from violation of the wide-scope requirement to 
compliance with it.  But, intuitively, not all of these ways of 
proceeding are on a par as far as rationality goes.  Responding by 
giving up one's means-end belief seems less rational than giving up 
one's end or intending the means.  And giving up an end may seem to be 
more like escaping from the requirement than coming to comply with it.  
The wide-scope interpretation of instrumental coherence seems unable to 
account for these asymmetries.  (Symmetry objections to the wide-scope 
formulations of rational requirements are found in Schroeder 2004, 2005a,
 2009; Kolodny 2005; Bedke 2009.  For replies to some of these 
objections, see Way 2011; Brunero 2012; and Shpall forthcoming.)</p>

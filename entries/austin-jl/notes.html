<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">John Langshaw Austin</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Austin&rsquo;s emphasis on the good standing of distinctions drawn
within ordinary language echoes a similar emphasis in Cook Wilson. See
Marion 2009. It is recapitulated and developed in Grice and Strawson
1956 and Putnam 1962.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Ultimately, the dispute between Austin&rsquo;s approach and
approaches based broadly on Grice&rsquo;s work turns on delicate
issues concerning the extent to which, and ways in which, ordinary
judgments, and our views about the sources and status of ordinary
judgments, can be overturned either on the basis of attempts to
systematize and generalize those judgments, or on the basis of our
commitment to general principles taken to govern specific judgments.
Grice recognizes a special case of the general issue in his
<em>Studies</em> (1989: 49).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 This component of Austin&rsquo;s views about truth has figured
importantly in recent discussions about the context- or
occasion-sensitivity of our use of language. See, for example, Travis
2008: 1&ndash;18.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 The distinction between performative and descriptive functions had
earlier been articulated and exploited by Austin in his &ldquo;Other
Minds&rdquo; (1946). Austin&rsquo;s feel for the distinction appears
to have stemmed from his engagement with some of H. A.
Prichard&rsquo;s work on the nature of promises, about which Austin
and Prichard had corresponded. See e.g., Prichard 1979: 171.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Austin&rsquo;s paper formed part of a symposium with Strawson 1950,
as co-symposiast, offering a critical response. Others soon joined the
fray. The ensuing dispute was messy, and served, I think, to hinder
understanding of, and engagement with, Austin&rsquo;s initial
discussion. A useful discussion of some of the initial mess may be
found in Wheatley 1969. See also Chisholm 1964; Mates 1974; Strawson
1964b, 1965; Warnock 1962, 1964, 1973c, 1989: 45&ndash;64; C.J.F.
Williams 1973.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Austin writes: &ldquo;the statement&hellip;is a &lsquo;logical
construction&rsquo; out of the makings of statements&rdquo; (1962b: 1
fn.1).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Note that Austin doesn&rsquo;t claim that the formula specifies a
<em>necessary</em> condition for truth.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 These are conventions only in the general sense that they are
correlations that are both arbitrary and instituted on the basis of
manifest human decision. Thus &lsquo;conventional&rsquo; is employed
to contrast with &lsquo;natural&rsquo; in something like the way
suggested in Plato&rsquo;s <em>Cratylus</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 The distinction here partly reflects a distinction that figures
throughout Austin&rsquo;s work between general (type) abilities,
opportunities for their exercise, and their particular exercises. A
distinction of this sort plays a central role in Austin&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Other Minds&rdquo; (1946) and <em>Sense and Sensibilia</em>
(1962a) discussions of knowledge and perception, and also figures in
his &ldquo;Ifs and Cans&rdquo; (1956a) discussion of abilities.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Although Austin doesn&rsquo;t take a stand on the matter, it would be
an over-simplification to think that the demonstrative conventions
must function independently of the descriptive conventions. It may
well be, for example, that the descriptive conventions aid selection
of a target situation&mdash;for instance, by indicating that the
target situation is, or might easily be taken to be, one in which a
cat is on a mat.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 It is because decision or judgment is required in order to determine
classification of the present case as e.g., red, rather than this
being determined by purely natural relations of similarity, that
Austin speaks here of a role for an additional
<em>convention</em>.The two most important aspects of Austin&rsquo;s thought here are these. First, sameness of type is registered in judgment or (in an attenuated sense) decision, rather than in experience (which registers only similarities). Second, what is a matter for judgment or decision is not simply whether there is a sameness present but rather whether the sameness that is required by a particular linguistic typing is present. What Austin says leaves open whether he means to be sketching an account of the determination of types or rather offering only an outline account of the registration of, and selection amongst, independently determined types. On the former view, Austin would be outlining a theory of types or universals; on the latter, he would be offering an account of the connection between types or universals and linguistic practice. Austin makes some relevant observations about theories of universals in his 1940ms, especially: 69&ndash;75.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 It&rsquo;s plausible that in appealing to states of affairs,
situations, and events as a range of particulars, Austin was in effect
following Cook Wilson&rsquo;s lead. See Marion 2009 for discussion of
Cook Wilson&rsquo;s views concerning the existence of such
particulars.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 This provides the context for Austin&rsquo;s favorable reference to
&ldquo;&lsquo;coherence&rsquo; and pragmatist theories of truth&rdquo;
triggered by the following question: &ldquo;Is it true or false that
the dog goes round the cow?&rdquo; (1950a: 130, 130 fn.1). Plausibly,
this alludes to William James&rsquo; discussion of the
occasion-sensitivity of the question whether, in a case in which both
a squirrel and a man are circling a tree, the man goes round the
squirrel (James 1907/1975).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 The requirement here would have to be made more complicated in order
to cope with the different way that truth can vary across contexts due
to indexicals (e.g., &ldquo;here&rdquo;, &ldquo;now&rdquo;) or
demonstratives (e.g., &ldquo;this&rdquo;). However, since the
sentences we are considering do not (explicitly) involve indexicals or
demonstratives, we can ignore that complication for present
purposes.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 For discussion of the bearing of Austin&rsquo;s views on the standing
of literal meaning, see Crary 2002 and Hansen 2014.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 Austin considers taking the third line with a range of cases
including definitions, value judgments, and performatives in
&ldquo;Truth&rdquo; (1950a: 131&ndash;132). It is a good question how
well this approach can be fitted with his deflationary leanings.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 1962b. Austin first appeals to a version of the distinction in
&ldquo;Other Minds&rdquo; (1946: 97&ndash;103), in discussing the
function of claims to know.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 Austin&rsquo;s doesn&rsquo;t explicitly state that the illocutionary
act is the fundamental locus of assessment as to truth. However, the
claim is of a piece with his claim (considered earlier in discussing
whether Austin is a deflationist about truth) that assessment as to
truth covers a variety of more specific assessments as to merit
(including happiness), assessments which themselves most naturally
target illocutionary acts: assessments as to fairness, reasonableness,
and so forth. See 1950a: 130, 1956b: 250&ndash;251, 1957: 180. In
addition, Austin emphasises that, on his view, the
<em>rheme</em>&mdash;the core of the locutionary act&mdash;&ldquo;is a
unit of <em>speech</em>; its typical fault is to be vague or void or
obscure, &amp;c.&rdquo; (1962b: 98); its characteristic fault is not
to be false. Similarly, Austin considers the types of failures to
which locutionary acts are characteristically susceptible and says,
&ldquo;&hellip;failures here will not be unhappinesses as [in the case
of the illocutionary act], but rather failures to get the words out,
to express ourselves clearly, etc.&rdquo; (1962b: 106). Finally, if
Austin viewed the locutionary act rather than the illocutionary act as
the fundamental target of assessment as to truth, then it would be
difficult to understand Austin&rsquo;s treatment of performative
utterances in the context of his distinction between locutionary and
illocutionary acts. Performative utterances differ from other
utterances in an illocutionary, rather than a locutionary, way. Hence,
the default prediction would be that performative utterances are apt
for any form of assessment that applies to locutionary acts in
general. If those forms of assessment included assessment as to truth,
then it would be natural to expect Austin to use the distinction
between locutionary and illocutionary acts as the basis for explicitly
rejecting the earlier suggestion that performative utterances are not
up for assessment as to truth. What Austin does instead is to argue
that performative utterances <em>may</em> be at the service of
<em>illocutionary</em> acts that are apt for assessment as to
truth&mdash;in particular, acts of stating (see 1962b:
133&ndash;147).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Austin 1946 is ostensibly an engagement with Wisdom 1946 on the topic
of knowledge of other minds. Although Austin focuses on general issues
about knowledge, he also draws on the general discussion in making
some interesting and distinctive proposals about knowledge of other
minds (see Austin 1946: 103&ndash;116).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 For example, Austin writes: &ldquo;Surely, if what has so been said
is correct, then we are often right to say we <em>know</em> even in
cases where we turn out subsequently to have been mistaken&mdash;and
indeed we seem always, or practically always, liable to be
mistaken&rdquo; (1946: 98).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 Austin focuses on the slightly unusual presentation of such an
argument in Ayer 1940, together with some consideration of its
development in Price 1932, as well as the connected discussion in
Warnock 1953. Austin&rsquo;s explicit aim is to undermine one form of
argument, in a small number of particular presentations. However, he
takes the texts that he considers to be &ldquo;&hellip;the best
available expositions of the approved reasons for holding theories
which are at least as old as Heraclitus&hellip;&rdquo; (1962a: 1), and
he expresses the hope that some of the arguments and methods that he
employs may have wider applicability. However, it is a legitimate
source of complaint that Austin doesn&rsquo;t give the argument that
he considers the best possible run for its money, and doesn&rsquo;t
consider closely related and more convincing arguments. For example,
Austin fails to consider arguments based upon the apparent possibility
of hallucinations that are induced by brain manipulation and that
perfectly match (are indistinguishable from) genuine cases of
perception. For discussion see Martin ms.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 Austin&rsquo;s position is a clear precursor of forms of
disjunctivism about perception, as developed for example in Hinton
1973, Martin 1997, McDowell 1982, and Snowdon 1981. However, I
don&rsquo;t think that Austin can be read straightforwardly as a
proto-disjunctivist. A minimal commitment of disjunctivism is
rejection of the more general principle that it follows from the fact
that two <em>experiences</em> are indiscriminable on the basis of
introspection (contrast: the <em>objects</em> of two experiences are
indiscriminable) to their subject that the experiences are of the same
fundamental kind (contrast: have objects of the same fundamental
kind). And as far as I know, Austin doesn&rsquo;t clearly and
explicitly reject the general principle. He therefore leaves somewhat
open that an argument for sense-data, or against his favored view of
perception, might be mounted on the basis of the more general
principle. And to that extent, he isn&rsquo;t (clearly and explicitly)
a disjunctivist about sensory experience. See Soteriou 2009.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 Austin seems later to withdraw, or at least to weaken, the claim here
about &ldquo;intentionally&rdquo;, perhaps due in part to the
influence of G. E. M. Anscombe. See Austin 1966: 283&ndash;285.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 Austin appears to endorse the following style of account. An
<em>aggravating</em> modifier is (normally) correctly applicable to
actions of type <em>A</em> when and only when the following
<em>two</em> conditions are met: (a) the piece of machinery targeted
by the modifier is <em>not</em> involved in normal or standard (free
and responsible) instances of <em>A</em>; and (b) the piece of
machinery targeted by the modifier <em>is</em> involved in this
particular instance of <em>A</em>. Where an application fails
condition (a) and meets condition (b), it is liable to represent to an
audience that the piece of machinery in question is <em>not</em>
involved in normal or standard instances of <em>A</em>. Similarly, an
<em>excusing</em> modifier is (normally) correctly applicable to
instances of action type <em>A</em> when and only when the following
two conditions are met: (a) the piece of machinery targeted by the
modifier <em>is</em> involved in normal or standard (free and
responsible) instances of <em>A</em>; and (b) the piece of machinery
targeted by the modifier is <em>not</em> involved in this particular
instance of <em>A</em>. Where an application fails condition (a), it
is liable to represent that the piece of machinery in question
<em>is</em> involved in normal and standard (free and responsible)
instances of type <em>A</em>. Where such an application meets
condition (b), it&rsquo;s liable to represent that machinery which
normally serves to underpin free and responsible actions of the type
in question is not operative in the present instance. See 1957:
189&ndash;193; 1966.</p>
</div>

<p>
To a first approximation, one might usefully think of the (a)
conditions as akin to kinds of felicity conditions and the (b)
conditions as akin to felicity-dependent truth-conditions. Note that
I&rsquo;ve presented the account as though pairs of modifiers like
&ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; and &ldquo;involuntary&rdquo; target the same
machinery. However, Austin holds that, in some cases, such pairs
target different machinery so that, for example,
&ldquo;involuntary&rdquo; is not equivalent to &ldquo;not
voluntary&rdquo;. See Austin 1957: 189&ndash;193.</p>

<div id="note-25">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 Austin in effect allows (for the sake of argument) that in cases in
which we would take (i) &ldquo;<em>S</em> can <em>A</em>&rdquo; to be
true, we would also be prepared to take to be true (ii)
&ldquo;<em>S</em> can <em>A</em>, if <em>S</em> chooses to&rdquo;.
However, Austin rejects both Moore&rsquo;s claims (iii) that it
follows that the conditional claim made using &ldquo;If <em>S</em>
chooses to <em>A</em>, <em>S</em> can <em>A</em>&rdquo; is true and
(iv) that it follows that the conditional claim made using &ldquo;If
<em>S</em> chooses to <em>A</em>, <em>S</em> will <em>A</em>&rdquo; is
true. In both cases, Austin&rsquo;s point is very simple. As Austin
understands the claims in (iii) and (iv), both claims&mdash;as
hypothetical or causal conditionals&mdash;ought to contrapose. Thus,
if Moore&rsquo;s proposal were correct, then we ought to be in a
position to derive from (i) and/or (ii) the following: (v) &ldquo;If
<em>S</em> can&rsquo;t <em>A</em>, it&rsquo;s not the case that
<em>S</em> chooses to <em>A</em>&rdquo; and (vi) &ldquo;If <em>S</em>
doesn&rsquo;t <em>A</em>, it&rsquo;s not the case that <em>S</em>
chooses to <em>A</em>&rdquo;. However, it seems obvious that neither
(v) nor (vi) follows from (i) or (ii). Ergo, according to Austin, we
should reject that claims that (iii) and (iv) follow from (i) and
(ii), and with them Moore&rsquo;s pretensions to have avoided the
problem posed to (i) by determinism.</p>

<p>
However, there is a flaw in Austin&rsquo;s argument, arising from its
dependence on contraposition. On the most natural construal, the
conditionals comprising Moore&rsquo;s proposal are subjunctive
conditionals, for example, &ldquo;If it were the case that <em>S</em>
chose to <em>A</em>, then it would be the case that <em>S</em> could
<em>A</em>.&rdquo; However, subjunctive conditionals do not
contrapose. From &ldquo;If it were not the case that I took the
homeopathic remedy, then I would have been ill for two weeks&rdquo; it
does not follow that this is true: &ldquo;If I had not been ill for
two weeks, then I would have taken the homeopathic remedy&rdquo;.
Nonetheless, although Austin&rsquo;s direct argument fails, at least
as directed against a subjunctive Moore, it is plausible that he is
anyway right to reject at least Moore&rsquo;s claim about (iii). More
pressing against that claim is the credibility of Austin&rsquo;s
counter-proposal, on which &ldquo;<em>S</em> can <em>A</em>, if
<em>S</em> chooses to&rdquo; is construed as &ldquo;<em>S</em> can
(<em>A</em> if <em>S</em> chooses to)&rdquo;, rather than as &ldquo;If
<em>S</em> were to choose to <em>A</em>, then it would be the case
that <em>S</em> could <em>A</em>&rdquo;. That is, it is more plausible
to understand the claim as one about our abilities to act on our
choices, than as one about what abilities we would possess were we to
make certain choices. After all, it&rsquo;s implausible to suppose
that one&rsquo;s choices bear in that way on whether or not one
possesses the ability to implement them. Moore&rsquo;s claim about
(iv), detached from its dependence on (iii), is a special case of the
second proposal of Moore&rsquo;s that Austin considers.</p>

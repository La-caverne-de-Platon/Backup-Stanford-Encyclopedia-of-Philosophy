<h2>Kinds of Use</h2>

<p>
In the discussion thus far, judgments are essentially identified with
their propositional contents. But according to Kant it is also
possible for a rational cognizer to <em>use</em> the very same
propositional content in different ways. These differences in use
should not be confused with the three types of taking-for-true or
<em>F&uuml;rwahrhalten</em>, i.e., the propositional attitudes of
opining, epistemic belief, and certainty, which are merely the three
basic &ldquo;stages&rdquo; (<em>Stufen</em>) of increasing rational
commitment to the truth (A820&ndash;823/B848&ndash;851). By contrast,
the use or <em>Gebrauch</em> of judgments can also be pragmatic,
moral, aesthetic, or teleological, and not epistemic. The fundamental
difference in uses of judgments is between (a) theoretical (e.g.,
scientific) judgments and (b) non-theoretical (e.g., pragmatic, moral,
aesthetic, or teleological) judgments. But there are also some crucial
differences between types of theoretical use of judgments.</p>

<h3><a name="TheJudNonJud">A. Theoretical judgments and non-theoretical judgments</a></h3>

<p>
According to Kant, theoretical judgments are judgments used such that
their overall rational purpose or function is to be true propositions
about the world, whether that world is taken to be phenomenal or
noumenal (20: 195). By contrast, non-theoretical judgments are
judgments such that this is not the case, precisely because they are
used <em>non-truth-theoretically</em>. For example, the overall
rational purpose of a non-theoretical judgment might be to make
instrumental or non-instrumental free choices or decisions (pragmatic
or moral judgments, i.e., &ldquo;practical propositions&rdquo;) (20:
196). Or it might be to evaluate the beauty or sublimity of phenomenal
objects (aesthetic judgments of taste) (5: 203&ndash;356). Or it might
be to treat natural things as if they had goal-directed or purposive
structure, as a heuristic guide for the construction of better
mechanistic explanations of physical phenomena (teleological
judgments) (5: 359&ndash;484). In any case, it would be a serious
mistake to think that the propositional content of a judgment is
irrelevant to its non-theoretical uses. On the contrary,
pragmatic/moral judgments, judgments of taste, and teleological
judgments are all <em>individuated</em> by their propositional
contents, because these contents determine what the judgment is
<em>about</em>. But the rational purpose or function of a
non-theoretical judgment can be realized even if its propositional
content is false. What matters for a non-theoretical judgment is how
things <em>seem</em> to the judger, not how they actually
<em>are</em>. In this way, a particular choice or decision can be good
or right even if it is based on false beliefs. A visual experience of
that thing over there, which you take to be a beautiful rose, can be a
genuine experience of the beautiful, even if in fact it is not a rose
or does not even exist (5: 205). And a teleological judgment about
something&rsquo;s apparent natural purpose (e.g., heliotropic plants
turning towards the sun because they &ldquo;want&rdquo; sunlight) can
be heuristically useful in the construction of a fully mechanistic
theory of biological phenomena (5: 397&ndash;415). Indeed, in these
respects, Kant&rsquo;s account of judgment anticipates Dennett&rsquo;s
(1987) notion of the &ldquo;intentional stance&rdquo;.</p>

<h3><a name="B">B. Theoretical use 1: constitutive judgments and regulative judgments</a></h3>

<p>
Just as there are different varieties of non-theoretical use of
judgments, so too there are different varieties of theoretical use.
Two of the most important of these varieties emerge in Kant&rsquo;s
distinction between &ldquo;constitutive&rdquo; and
&ldquo;regulative&rdquo; judgments. Kant has several different ways of
formulating this difference, but the nub of the distinction is this: a
theoretical judgment is used constitutively if and only if its
meaning, truth, or legitimacy as a
&ldquo;principle&rdquo;(<em>Grundsatz</em>, <em>Prinzip</em>) is not
based on any further assumptions, hypothetical conditions, or
suppositions; whereas a theoretical judgment is used regulatively if
and only if its meaning, truth, or legitimacy as a principle is based
on some further assumptions, hypothetical conditions, or suppositions.
Thus the synthetic a priori &ldquo;mathematical&rdquo; principles of
pure understanding are said by Kant to be constitutive, while the
synthetic a priori &ldquo;dynamical&rdquo; principles of pure
understanding are said to be regulative
(A178&ndash;181/B220&ndash;224). This is because the meaning and truth
of instances of the former (e.g., &ldquo;2+2=4&rdquo;) is not based on
any existential assumptions about the actual application of that
judgment (i.e., &ldquo;2+2=4&rdquo; would still be true even if every
two pairs of apples whenever counted up always magically fused into
one apple, The Big Apple), while by contrast the meaning and truth of
instances of the latter (e.g., &ldquo;Material objects fall towards
the earth at the rate of 10 meters per second/per second&rdquo; or
&ldquo;A caused B&rdquo;) is based on existential assumptions about
the existence of matter and the existence of antecedent events in
causal relations.</p>

<p>
Another important application of the distinction between the
constitutive and regulative uses of judgments concerns the precise
semantic status of &ldquo;empty&rdquo; propositions (i.e.,
propositions lacking objective validity) that also have the same
overall form as objectively valid synthetic a priori judgments.
According to Kant, all such empty propositions contain &ldquo;ideas of
pure reason,&rdquo; which are either concepts of noumenal objects or
else meta-concepts that posit &ldquo;totalizing&rdquo; extensions of
the pure concepts of the understanding (A320/B377,
A326&ndash;329/B382&ndash;386). Examples of such propositions would be
(<em>W</em>) &ldquo;Everything belonging to the natural kind
<em>water</em> does so by virtue of its Lockean essence or real
internal constitution,&rdquo; and (<em>G</em>) &ldquo;A benevolent God
exists.&rdquo; Under their constitutive uses, judgments (<em>G</em>)
and (<em>W</em>) have no truth-values. Nor indeed do (<em>G</em>) and
(<em>W</em>), strictly speaking, have truth-values under their
regulative uses. But there is according to Kant a perfectly legitimate
regulative use of judgment (<em>W</em>) in natural science as a
principle according to which nature is judged merely <em>as if</em>
(<em>W</em>) were true, in order to group all otherwise
macroscopically disparate kinds of water (e.g., ice, steam, water in
its liquid state, etc.) and study them with the goal of finding some
unified set of causal laws that systematically explains the overall
phenomenal behavior of the natural kind <em>water</em>
(A645&ndash;647/B673&ndash;675). And there is also according to Kant a
perfectly legitimate regulative use of (<em>G</em>) in morality as a
&ldquo;postulate of practical reason&rdquo;, which in turn is a basic
propositional target of moral belief or <em>Glauben</em>, according to
which our moral lives are to be conducted as if we could epistemically
believe or scientifically know that God benevolently guarantees that
all and only the happy people are morally virtuous, in order to
strengthen our otherwise naturally flawed and shifting moral resolve,
and make our moral lives fully meaningful
(A633&ndash;634/B661&ndash;662, A812&ndash;819/B840&ndash;847). More
generally, these last two cases show that otherwise empty or
non-objectively-valid judgments are used regulatively when their
legitimacy as principles depends on their being adopted solely for the
purpose of making scientific inquiry or moral life into a coherent,
meaningful whole. This same coherence/meaning-making status also holds
for several important maxims or mottoes of scientific inquiry that are
often mistaken for extremely general theoretical judgments, e.g., that
nature never multiplies entities without necessity (Ockham&rsquo;s
Razor) or that nature makes no leaps (the law of continuity)
(A652&ndash;663/B680&ndash;691). As Kant recognized and as every
hands-on scientist knows, the natural world up close seems to be
distressingly messy and full of holes. Thus the general rational idea
of what Kant calls &ldquo;the systematic unity of nature&rdquo;
(A650&ndash;668/B678&ndash;696) bridges the gap between the messy
experimental front lines of natural scientific research, which could
all-too-easily lead to destructive skepticism and undermine the
rational enterprise of natural science itself, and the compact,
elegant beauty of its abstract mathematical or structural models,
which in turn evoke the working scientist&rsquo;s sense that some sort
of rational deep design permeates nature. This aesthetic and
teleological bridging-tactic thereby emotionally super-charges the
personal and social practice of natural scientific research by
conferring upon it the collectively-felt solidarity of a coherent,
meaningful, and intersubjectively valid rational enterprise. In this
sense, Kant is the original discoverer of <em>the aesthetics of
science</em> (see, e.g., Breitenbach 2015).</p>

<h3><a name="C">C. Theoretical use 2: determining judgments and reflective judgments</a></h3>

<p>
The second important pair of theoretical uses can be found in
Kant&rsquo;s distinction between &ldquo;determining&rdquo; judgments
and &ldquo;reflective&rdquo; judgments. A confusing feature of this
distinction is that it crosses over the constitutive vs. regulative
distinction. Indeed, the determining judgment vs. reflective judgment
distinction is not even explicitly mentioned in the Critical period
until the first Introduction to the <em>Critique of the Power of
Judgment</em> (20: 211), nevertheless it is clearly very closely
related to some remarks about the regulative use of the ideas of
reason in the first <em>Critique</em>&rsquo;s Appendix to the
Transcendental Dialectic, and in particular to a distinction Kant
makes there between &ldquo;apodictic&rdquo; and
&ldquo;hypothetical&rdquo; uses of judgment (CPR A647/B675). Here Kant
asserts that at least some regulative uses of judgment, and in
particular, regulative judgments about the systematic unity of nature,
have a transcendental presuppositional bearing on the truth of both
synthetic a priori and synthetic a posteriori judgments in natural
science, and do not play a merely secondary or heuristic role in
scientific investigation (CPR A648/B676, A651/B679). In the third
<em>Critique</em>, this somewhat inchoate and surprising assertion is
developed into the explicit doctrine that judgments of taste are
governed by a &ldquo;subjectively necessary&rdquo; transcendental
principle to the effect that the existence of legitimate judgments of
taste about the beautiful in nature presupposes that we must believe
that the formal structures of empirical nature are well-adjusted to
(even if not precisely designed for) the innate structures of our
cognitive faculties (5: 179&ndash;186) (20: 215&ndash;216, 211). Kant
seems also to hold in one or two places in the third <em>Critique</em>
that teleological judgments are not merely heuristically useful for
the mechanistic study of biological phenomena, but in fact are
heuristically necessary (5: 376&ndash;383, 400) for this purpose. In
contemporary terms, this is equivalent to the important claim that our
fully mechanistic organismic, molecular, and cellular branches of
biology all <em>constitutively require</em> the intentional stance.
Finally, there are some even more tantalizing hints in the third
<em>Critique</em> to the effect that the heuristic necessity of
teleological judgments about self-organizing, self-initiated non-human
animal movements implies that we must also (morally?) believe that our
own human animal bodies can be freely moved by the choices of our
wills in intentional agency (5: 397&ndash;399). </p>

<p>
In any case, both judgments of taste and teleological judgments are
held by Kant to be reflective judgments, not determining judgments.
The difference between the determining use of a judgment and the
reflective use of a judgment has to do with the way in which the
predicative structure of a simple categorical judgment is interpreted
(5: 179) (20: 211). Normally, predication is interpreted as involving
either the &ldquo;subsumption&rdquo; of a particular individual (say,
Socrates) under a universal concept (say, the concept of being a
philosopher), or the subsumption of a narrower concept (say, being
human) under a wider concept (say, being mortal). This is the
&ldquo;determining&rdquo; interpretation of predication in a judgment,
because it logically brings a &ldquo;determinate&rdquo; individual or
narrower concept under a universal or more general
&ldquo;determinable&rdquo; concept. But Kant thinks that it is also
possible to interpret predication in the reverse direction: that is,
from &ldquo;determinate&rdquo; to &ldquo;determinable.&rdquo; This is
the &ldquo;reflective&rdquo; interpretation of predication in a
judgment, not only because it advances logically from a particular
individual or narrower concept to a universal or more general concept,
as, e.g., in induction or abduction (i.e., inference to the best
explanation), but also because it directly invokes the cognitive
subject&rsquo;s ability to form higher-order representations of
herself via the act of reflection or <em>&Uuml;berlegung</em> and thus
to be rationally self-conscious or apperceptive (B2,
A260&ndash;263/B316&ndash;319) (20: 211). In any case, we can now
clearly see that, given the special roles of judgments of taste and
teleological judgments in the <em>Critique of the Power of
Judgment</em>, Kant believes that the reflective use of judgment has
an extremely important function not only in the natural sciences but
also in transcendental philosophy. </p>

<h2>Appendix: Quiddistically Different Worlds, Irremediable Ignorance, and Regress of Powers</h2>

<p>
In this Appendix we will present some of the most remarkable arguments
and criticisms the dispositionalists and categoricalists have traded.
One important criticism of categoricalism concerns two possible worlds
that are <em>merely &lsquo;quiddistically&rsquo;
different</em> over properties (Black 2000; Kistler 2002; Mumford
2004; Bird 2005b, 2007a; Schaffer 2005; Lewis 2009). Consider a
possible world that is the same as our actual world except that mass
plays exactly the same theoretical roles as electric charge actually
does and conversely. The categoricalist, who typically invokes
quidditism which asserts that the essence of a property is given
independently of its theoretical roles, seems to be under pressure to
hold that this world should be distinguished from the actual world.
Black (2000, p. 94) urges, however, that our intuition dictates that
the categoricalist&rsquo;s distinction between the possible world and our
actual world is a <em>distinction without difference</em>. In
view of the fact that the true and complete physical theory of the
possible world is exactly the same as ours, there seems to be no point
in counting it as being distinct from our actual world. This is echoed
by Bird (2005b, p. 450) who says that this world is just the actual
world plus a decision to swap the names &lsquo;electric charge&rsquo;
and &lsquo;mass&rsquo;. This intuition can be served by saying that
the essence of a property is constituted by its theoretical roles.
When in a possible world a property plays exactly the same theoretical
roles as mass actually does, then it is as a matter of fact mass,
and <em>mutatis mutandis</em> for other properties.</p>

<p>
This thought experiment apparently has some intuitive appeal. It would
be hazardous, however, to derive immediately from it that, for every
property, its essence wholly consists of its theoretical roles. For it
may well be objected that one such thought experiment is not yet
enough to establish the <em>universal
generalization</em> that, for any pair of properties, even if we
swap their theoretical roles, we won&rsquo;t get a truly different possible
world. Moreover, it is questionable how much argumentative force it
has against the categoricalist. Notice that the properties involved in
it, namely, the properties of electric charge and mass, are generally
taken to be <em>dispositional</em>. If so, the categoricalist,
who firmly holds that all real properties are categorical, might
insist that they are not <em>real</em> properties and
question the legitimacy of talk of their essences. Of course, the
dispositionalist probably has much to say in defiance of this
response. She might respond that, given that the properties of
electric charge and mass play key theoretical roles in fundamental
sciences, it is abominable to deny their reality. She might
alternatively attempt to build an analogical example to the thought
experiment under discussion in terms of properties generally taken to
be <em>categorical</em> properties, say triangularity and
rectangularity.</p>

<p>
The second criticism of categoricalism, due to Shoemaker (1980, 1998),
goes that, whilst quidditism is typically invoked by the
categoricalist, it has <em>epistemologically</em> disastrous
consequences (see also Robinson 1993; Jackson 1998; Black 2000; Lewis
2009). As noted earlier, quidditism is the view that the essences of
properties consist of something logically different from their
theoretical roles&mdash;in Shoemaker&rsquo;s terms, their causal
potentialities. It is claimed, however, that this opens the
possibilities of a property that has no potential whatsoever for
contributing to causal powers, of two properties that have exactly the
same potential for contributing to causal powers, of an object that
undergoes a radical change in properties without undergoing any change
in its causal powers, and of an object that undergoes a radical change
in its causal powers without undergoing any change in its properties.
But we have epistemic access to properties only via their causal
powers. What follows from this observation is that, if these
possibilities are real possibilities, then we are pressed to say that
&lsquo;nothing could be good evidence that the overall resemblance
between two things is greater than two other things&rsquo; (Shoemaker
1980, p. 215)&mdash;because there is no possible evidence about how
many <em>causally impotent properties</em> two things
share&mdash;that &lsquo;it is impossible for us even to know that two
things resemble one another by sharing a single property&rsquo;
(<em>ibid</em>.), and that &lsquo;it is impossible for us to know that
something has retained a property over time, or that something has
undergone a change with respect to the properties that underlie its
causal powers&rsquo; (<em>ibid</em>.). Shoemaker insists, though, it
is highly implausible that we have such an <em>irremediable
ignorance </em>about properties.</p>

<p>
It is hard to dispute the validity of Shoemaker&rsquo;s charge of
scepticism. It is up for debate how much weight it carries, though.
Shoemaker stresses that this sceptical consequence is costly enough to
evaporate the credibility of quidditism, and therefore that of
categoricalism. By the same token, Bird (2005b, p. 453) says,
&lsquo;we do not want our metaphysics of properties to condemn us to
the necessary ignorance of them&rsquo;. Lewis (2009, p. 211),
conversely, endorses the sceptical consequence and quips &lsquo;Who
ever promised me that I was capable in principle of knowing
everything?&rsquo;. No consensus has yet been reached as to the force
of the charge of scepticism against quidditism. See Whittle 2006 for
the claim that quidditism doesn&rsquo;t entail scepticism unless it is
combined with an <em>unreasonably</em> strong account of
identification. See also Langton 2004; Schaffer 2005; and Ney 2007 for
the claim that quidditism doesn&rsquo;t entail scepticism unless it is
combined with an <em>implausible </em>infallibilist account of
knowledge.</p>

<p>
Let us now turn to a criticism of dispositionalism&mdash;known as
&lsquo;Always packing never traveling argument&rsquo;&mdash;whose key
thought is that dispositionalism is caught in a certain sort
of <em>vicious regress
</em>or <em>circularity</em> (Campbell 1976; Swinburne 1980;
Foster 1982; Robinson 1982; Blackburn 1990; Armstrong 1997; Heil 2003;
Molnar 2003; Chakravartty 2007; Bird 2007b)&mdash;there is a different
type of charge of infinite regress due to Psillos (2006) but it is
repudiated by Marmodoro (2009). Armstrong (1997, p. 80) says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Can it be that everything is potency, and act is the mere shifting
around of potencies? &hellip; Given a purely Dispositionalist account
of properties, particulars would seem to be always re-packing their
bags as they change their properties, yet never taking a journey from
potency to act. For &lsquo;act&rsquo;, on this view, is no more than a
different potency.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are different ways of articulating this criticism. What Bird
(2007b) takes as the most pressing starts with the assumption that the
essential characterisation of disposition \(D_1\) must include a
reference to its manifestation \(M_1\) (cf. Williams 2010 and Lowe
2010). On dispositionalism that all properties have dispositional
essences, however, the property instantiated in \(M_1\) is also
another disposition \(D_2\). But dispositions are dispositions to
bring about certain manifestations.  Consequently, \(D_2\)&rsquo;s
essential characterisation must be given in terms of its own
manifestation \(M_2\). On dispositionalism, the property instantiated
in \(M_2\) is still another disposition \(D_3\)&hellip;. This leads to
either an infinite regress or circularity. Bird correctly stresses
that both of them are problematic for dispositionalism. But he goes
further to argue that this problem can be overcome by appealing to
what is known as graph theory, contending that it is possible for the
structure of manifestation relations to uniquely determine the
identity and distinctiveness of dispositions. But this is disputed by
Lowe (2010) and Ingthorsson (2012).</p>

<p>
Barker (2013) raises scathing criticisms of dispositionalism, where he
distinguishes three different ways of understanding 
dispositionalism&mdash;in his terms, three different ways of understanding the pure
power theory. Due to the space constraint, I will focus on the first
version of dispositionalism, namely, the way of relational
constitution, that he spends most energy in refuting&mdash;following
Barker, call it &lsquo;relationalism&rsquo;. Relationalism maintains
that the identities of properties are purely constituted by their
standing second-order relations (e.g., the relations of necessitation)
to other properties. Property \(F\)&rsquo;s identity is fixed by the
unique pattern of such relations it bears to other 
properties&mdash;for short, call those relations \(X\)-relations. Assuming that
there is no property substratum hidden under \(X\)-relations, on
relationalism, properties are characterised purely as bundles of the
\(X\)-relations they engage in. But Barker proclaims that
relationalism, so understood, utterly fails.</p>

<p>
Consider three properties \(F, G, H\), and suppose that, for a given
\(X\)-relation \(R\) of necessitation, \(F\) stands the relation \(R\)
to \(G, G\) stands \(R\) to \(H\), but \(F\) doesn&rsquo;t stand \(R\)
to \(H\). The trouble is that there is nothing in the structure of
bundles that would explain why \(F\) stands \(R\) to \(G\) but
doesn&rsquo;t to \(H\). Why is it the case that \(F\) bears \(R\) to
\(G\)?  Relationalists might answer this question by saying that \(F\)
contains \(R\)&rsquo;s necessitator terminus and \(G\) contains
\(R\)&rsquo;s necessitated terminus. But this answer doesn&rsquo;t
help. Why?  On the one hand, in order for \(F\) to stand \(R\) to \(G,
F\)need be able to play the necessitator role, which means that it
must contain \(R\)&rsquo;s necessitator terminus.  On the other, in
order for \(G\) to stand an \(X\)-relation to \(H, H\) need be able to
play the necessitated role, which means that it must contain
\(R\)&rsquo;s necessitated terminus.  Consequently, \(F\) contains
\(R\)&rsquo;s necessitator terminus and \(H\) contains \(R\)&rsquo;s
necessitated terminus. Assuming that the fact that \(F\) contains
\(R\)&rsquo;s necessitator terminus and \(G\) contains \(R\)&rsquo;s
necessitated terminus is what makes it the case that they bear the
\(X\)-relation \(R\) to each other, we then have a result that
contradicts our initial supposition that \(F\) doesn&rsquo;t bear
\(R\) to \(H\). Nothing in the structure of bundles would prevent
\(F\) from bearing \(R\) to \(H\) as well as to \(G\).</p>

<p>
From this Barker (p. 633) concludes that &ldquo;we need to add another
ontological ingredient to the bundles to get the fact of relation that
\(F\) bears the \(X\)-relation to \(G\)&rdquo;. The problem is that
there are no promising candidates for this ingredient.  Barker
considers the option of postulating a plurality of quidditistic
\(X\)-relations, \(X_1, X_2\), etc., each qualitatively distinct from
the other. Let&rsquo;s say that \(X_1\) links \(F\) with \(G\) since
\(F\) contains the necessitator terminus of \(X_1\) and \(G\) contains
the necessitated termini of \(X_1\). Similarly, \(X_2\) links \(G\)
with \(H\) since \(G\) contains the necessitator termini of \(X_2\)
and \(H\) contains the necessitated termini of \(X_2\). But this
option begs the question of how all these quiddistically distinct
\(X\)-relations, \(X_1, X_2, \ldots\), can play the same role of
fixing the identities of properties.  Barker (<em>ibid</em>.) poses
this line of reasoning as a kind of destructive dilemma: &ldquo;it
[relationalism] needs a unique \(X\)-relation to determine a governing
role, but it needs a diversity of \(X\)-relations to get the
relational connectedness of bundles&rdquo;. (For a similar criticism
of dispositionalism, see Jacobs 2011.)</p>

<p>
We have thus far outlined some of the criticisms and arguments
proponents of dispositionalism and categoricalism bring forth for
consideration. It is worth noting that the possibility of
&lsquo;bare&rsquo; dispositions is often brought to bear on this
debate, for, categoricalism apparently necessitates the impossibility
of bare dispositions, i.e., that all dispositions must have distinct
causal bases, whilst dispositionalism doesn&rsquo;t. It is indeed claimed
that one of the most conclusive considerations in favour of
dispositionalism is that fundamental properties like spin are bare
dispositions (Mumford 2006). This issue is discussed in
 <a href="index-2.html#PosBarDis">section 4.1</a>.</p>

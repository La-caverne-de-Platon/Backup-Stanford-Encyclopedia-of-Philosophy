<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Newton&rsquo;s <em>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica</em></a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>
From the first paragraph of Halley's anonymous review of the
<em>Principia</em> in the <em>Transactions of the Royal Society</em>,
No. 186 (January, February, March 1687), p. 291.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>
 Unless otherwise noted, all
quotations from the <em>Principia</em> are from the Cohen-Whitman
translation. Because other translations and the original texts
are available, the location of the quotations within the
<em>Principia</em> will always be indicated in the text, usually in
terms of the Book and Proposition. Changes to the Cohen-Whitman
translation will be acknowledged in notes. One change has been made to
the translation of the quoted passage: &ldquo;explication&rdquo; has been used
instead of &ldquo;explanation,&rdquo; in keeping with Newton's choice of
<em>explicationem</em> instead of <em>explanationem</em>. Indeed,
no form of <em>explanare</em> occurs anywhere in any of the three
editions of the <em>Principia</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>
Two changes have been made to the Cohen-Whitman translation of the last
sentence, which in Latin reads, &ldquo;<em>Et satis est quod gravitas
revera existat, &amp; agat secundum leges a nobis expositas, &amp; ad
corporum caelestium &amp; maris nostril motus omnes
sufficiat.&rdquo;</em> First, the phrase &ldquo;to explain,&rdquo; no counterpart
of which occurs in the Latin, has been dropped from the last clause and
second, the three verbs <em>existat</em>, <em>agat</em>, and
<em>sufficiat</em> have been translated &ldquo;should exist,&rdquo;
should act,&ldquo; and &rdquo;should suffice,&ldquo; for all three are
in the subjunctive in the Latin.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>
For
details and background on all these approaches, see Curtis Wilson,
&rdquo;Predictive Astronomy in the Century after Kepler&ldquo; in Taton
and Wilson, 1989.</p>

In the case of an ellipse, the length of the major axis is twice the
mean distance from a focus.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>
The discovery was first announced in &rdquo;Letters on Sunspots&ldquo; of 1613 and
forms the heart of the argument against the Ptolemaic system in the
Third Day of his <em>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World
Systems</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
<em>The Epitome of Copernican Astronomy</em> of Kepler, the
<em>Dialogue Concerning Two Chief World Systems</em> of Galileo, and
the <em>Principia</em> (and, posthumously <em>Le Monde</em>) of
Descartes. Although Galileo does not expressly identify the
Tychonic system as the third chief world system, all of the Fourth Day
is directed against it.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>
The reasoning behind Newton's conclusion does not presuppose the law of
gravity, for all Newton required was something established in the
original &rdquo;De Motu&ldquo; tract, namely that the relative strengths of the
centripetal accelerations (at equal distances) toward Saturn, Jupiter,
the Earth, and the Sun vary as the invariant ratio between the squares
of the periods and cubes of the mean distances of the bodies orbiting
each. Textual evidence from the other scholium added to &rdquo;De Motu&ldquo;
&mdash; the one on resistance &mdash; shows that Newton did not yet have the law
of gravity, for he had not yet formulated the concept of mass.
For details, see G. E. Smith, &rdquo;How Did Newton Discover Universal
Gravity?&ldquo; in <em>Beyond Hypothesis: Newton's Experimental
Philosophy</em>, <em>The St. John's Review</em>, vol. xlv, no. 2
(1999), pp. 32-63).</p>

<em>Isaac Newton's Papers and Letters on Natural Philosophy</em>, ed.
I. Bernard Cohen, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1978, p. 106,
where Newton remarks, &rdquo;For if the possibility of hypotheses is to be
the test of the truth and reality of things, I see not how certainty
can be obtained in any science; since numerous hypotheses may be
devised, which shall seem to overcome new difficulties.&ldquo;</p>

The
quotation, with the italics in the original, is from Bertoloni
Meli's translation, p. 132. Bertoloni Meli shows in his
book that, contrary to what Leibniz claimed when publishing his
<em>Tentamen</em>, he had read at least significant parts of Newton's
<em>Principia</em>.</p>

The second
half of Book 2 Section 7, as it appeared in the first edition, can be
found in <strong>V</strong>, 775-784; for an English translation, see
Buchwald and Cohen, 2001, 299-313.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>
The
philosophical discussion of Newtonian space and time divides across
three distinct eras. During most of the eighteenth century,
before the extent to which Newton's theory of gravity succeeds in
dealing with the actual orbital motions became clear, the burden of
proof fell more or less equally on the supporters and critics of
Newton. During the nineteenth century the burden of proof fell
heavily on Newton's critics. During the twentieth century,
following Einsteinian relativity, the discussion, much of it highly
sophisticated, has centered on stating with precision the Newtonian
assumptions that were in error, as illustrated by the classic
philosophical discussion in Stein 1967. For an illuminating
examination of the history of the discussion, as well as a very careful
analysis of Newton's position, see DiSalle 2006. The position in
the text derives from Stein and DiSalle.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a>
Today we
would be more inclined to say no quantity without unequivocal
ordinality among its values, in the process distinguishing between
ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Although Newton was
perfectly aware of the difference between interval and ratio scales,
his insistence on the quantities entering physics involving definite
proportions is clear throughout the <em>Principia</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>
For more
about these assumptions and their later rejection, see DiSalle
2006.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>
This
analysis of Newton's second law is developed in detail in Bruce
Pourciau's &ldquo;Newton's Interpretation of Newton's Second Law,&rdquo;
<em>Archive for History of Exact Sciences</em>, 60, 2006, pp.
157-207.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>
The idea of
using the tension in the string to measure the centrifugal endeavor of
an object in uniform circular motion originated not with Huygens, but
with Descartes in a too much ignored passage, <strong>D</strong>, 3,
59. Huygens and Newton were both familiar with this passage.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a>
Newton had
employed the third law in his lectures on algebra as one of two
principles from which problems of impacting hard spheres could be
solved. See Whiteside, <em>The Mathematical Papers of Isaac
Newton</em>, vol. v, p. 149. The third law first became public,
however, in his <em>Principia</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a>
Newton goes
on to say, &ldquo;By means of the first two laws and the first two
corollaries Galileo found that the descent of heavy bodies is in the
squared ratio of the time and that the motion of projectiles occurs in
a parabola, as experiment confirms, except insofar as these motions are
somewhat retarded by the resistance of the air.&rdquo; In fact, Galileo
does not employ the notion of force at all in his derivation of these
two relationships, and contrary to legend however much Galileo may have
anticipated the first law, he never showed the least sign of
appreciating the implication that Descartes emphasized, that
curvilinear motion requires something to deflect the body out of its
motion in a straight line. In the second edition of the
<em>Principia</em> Newton adds a passage indicating how the two
Galilean relationships can be derived using the first two laws and
first two corollaries. All the evidence indicates that Newton
never read Galileo's <em>Two New Sciences</em> and knew of the results
in it only through secondary sources, including Huygens's
<em>Horologium Oscillatorium</em>. His claim about Galileo
accordingly was more likely just presumptuous, and not dishonest.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a>
The term
&ldquo;dynamics,&rdquo; as we now use it, derives from Leibniz (in the 1690s) and
not from Newton. The word does not occur in any of the three
editions of the <em>Principia</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a>
For a
reconstruction of Newton's efforts from his notes, see R. S.
Westfall, &ldquo;Newton and the Acceleration of Gravity,&rdquo;
<em>Archive for History of Exact Sciences</em>, 35, 2986, pp.
255-272.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a>
For details
of Huygens's efforts to measure surface gravity in 1659, see
Joella Yoder, <em>Unrolling Time: Christiaan Huygens and the
Mathematization of Nature</em>, Cambridge University Press, 1988,
Chapters 3 and 4.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a>
The center
of oscillation problem that Huygens addressed and solved was to
determine the length of the simple pendulum, with a single point-mass
bob on a massless string, that would have the same period as a pendulum
with multiple point-masses as bobs or with one or more rigid bodies as
bobs. The problem became celebrated after Marin Mersenne noted
that the answer is not the center of gravity of the distributed
mass.</p>

Strictly
speaking, their logical form is &ldquo;if&hellip; [then
if&hellip;,then&hellip;]&rdquo; where the initial antecedent involves the
laws of motion or their corollaries.</p>

is treated in Sections 2, 8, and 9 of Book 1.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a>
Section 9
of Book 1 treats precessing orbits, with Propositions 43 and 44
providing the striking result about the relationship between precession
and the inverse-cube and Proposition 45 developing this result further
for the case of nearly circular orbits, that is, for orbits like those
of all the then known planets and satellites.</p>

Corollaries
2 and 3 of Proposition 91, which were added to the first edition of
Book 1 in the summer of 1686, in proof.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-34" name="34">34.</a>
In the
Cohen and Whitman translation, the Latin <em>dedi expositos</em> is
rendered, &ldquo;given explanations;&rdquo; because Newton used <em>expositos</em>
rather than <em>explanatos</em>, the phrase is here translated &ldquo;set
forth,&rdquo; which is less awkward than the literal &ldquo;given settings forth&rdquo;
or &ldquo;given narrations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-35" name="35">35.</a>
Huygens's full solution for the central force in uniform circular
motion can be found in his posthumously published &ldquo;De
Vi Centrifuga,&rdquo; [<strong>OH</strong>, XV, 253-301]; the
corresponding independently developed solution by Newton can be found
in his &ldquo;De Motu,&rdquo; [<strong>M</strong>, 36-39] or
[<strong>U</strong>, 273].</p>

<p>

That is, on
the period of the pendulum remaining the same as the arc length
described by the bob increases or decreases.</p>

The
methodological complications raised by Newton's approach to resistance
forces in the second edition are discussed at length in Smith,

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-41" name="41">41.</a>
In classic
use the term &ldquo;hypothesis&rdquo; marked propositions from which deductions
were to be made. During the seventeenth century it came also to
mark conjectured theoretical claims. The first edition of Book 3
begins with a list of nine hypotheses that were clearly intended to be
propositions from which the deductions of the Book were to be made, and
not theoretical conjectures. The shift to &ldquo;Rules&rdquo; and &ldquo;Phenomena&rdquo;
in the second edition clarified the logical structure of the derivation
of the law of universal gravity and removed any thought that this
derivation gave the law an only hypothetical status. Newton did
not entirely abandon the label &ldquo;hypothesis&rdquo; in the second and third
editions. Section 9 of Book 2, as noted earlier, opens with a
Hypothesis, and Proposition 11, asserting that the center of gravity of
our planetary system is at rest, is immediately preceded by the
Hypothesis, &ldquo;The center of the system of the world is at rest.&rdquo;</p>

See Pierre
Duhem, <em>The Aim and Structure of Physical Theory</em>, Princeton
University Press, 1991, pp. 190-195. Duhem makes the widely made
mistake of saying that Newton deduced the inverse-square from the
ellipse, but his point holds equally well for the premise Newton
actually uses, that the orbits are stationary.</p>

The only
anachronism in this way of stating the conclusions is the term &lsquo;field&rsquo;
itself; that Newton certainly had the concept, though not the word, is
clear from his Definitions 6-8, [<strong>P</strong>, 406-08].</p>

From
Newton's remark in the text for Proposition 8, a second requirement for
taking the law to be exact is that there be some configuration that at
least approximates the pertinent celestial bodies toward which the net
centripetal forces of gravity are exactly inverse-square if these
forces arise from forces directed toward each part of the body.
The configuration cited is a sphere with spherically symmetric
density. In the treatment of resistance forces in Section 7 of
Book 2 Newton shows a similar preoccupation for identifying
circumstances in which the net force is exact when composed from forces
acting on the parts of the body.</p>

In the
first edition Newton gave no value for the perturbing action of the Sun
in Proposition 3, instead only claiming that this action accounts for
the 4/243 fraction. For more information on his use of twice the
correct value and the historical reaction to it, see Section 8.16 of &ldquo;A
Guide to Newton's <em>Principia</em>&rdquo; in the Cohen-Whitman translation
of the <em>Principia</em>.</p>

Save for
his failure to credit his rival Clairaut properly, Jean d'Alembert's
long article on the figure of the Earth in the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> of the 1750s provides a highly informative
account of the history of this issue in relation to Newton's
theory.</p>

Newton's
<em>Theory of the Moon's Motion</em>, published 1702 as part of David
Gregory's <em>Astronomiae Physicae &amp; Geometricae Elementa</em>,
employed an epicycle-like device that Jeremiah Horrocks had devised for
representing the precession of the lunar apogee and the inequality
known as the &ldquo;evection.&rdquo; In this regard, it was not derived from
the theory of gravity.</p>

Computers
now allow the orbital motions to be computed by means of numerical
integration of the equations of motion.</p>

As Halley
observed, if the comet that now bears his name had appeared at regular
intervals in the past, these intervals were not precisely 75 years
long, but varied from roughly 73 to 77 years. Clairaut provided
an explanation for this when he included the gravitational effects of
Jupiter and Saturn in his successful calculation of the return of this
comet in 1759. The question then arose, however, whether the
nearly one-month discrepancy in Clairaut's calculation might not be
evidence of some small resistance acting on the comet. Euler
subsequently suggested that the unexplained secular motion of the Moon
might also be from fluid resistance. So, as historically
compelling as Newton's argument was against resisting fluid in space,
it did not end all discussion.</p>

For a
discussion of the methodology that instead takes the Scholium at the
end of Section 11 as the starting point, see George E. Smith, &ldquo;The
Methodology of the <em>Principia</em>,&rdquo; in Cohen and Smith 2002.</p>

Huygens
offered an exceptionally lucid statement of this method in the preface
to his <em>Treatise on Light</em> of 1690, which was immediately
followed within the same covers by his <em>Discourse on the Cause of
Gravity</em> [<strong>HD</strong>] containing his response to Newton's
<em>Principia</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

One finds in this subject a kind of demonstration which does not carry
with it so high a degree of certainty as that employed in geometry;
and which differs distinctly from the method employed by geometers in
that they prove their propositions by well-established and
incontrovertible principles, while here principles are tested by the
inferences which are derivable from them. The nature of the subject
permits of no other treatment. It is possible, however, in this way to
establish a probability which is little short of certainty. This is
the case when the consequences of the assumed principles are in
perfect accord with the observed phenomena, and especially when these
verifications are numerous; but above all when one employs the
hypothesis to predict new phenomena and finds his expectations
realized.</blockquote>

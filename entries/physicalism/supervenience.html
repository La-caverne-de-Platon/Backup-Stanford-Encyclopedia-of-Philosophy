<h2><a id="SupPhyFurIss">Supervenience Physicalism: Further Issues</a></h2>

<p>Supervenience physicalism as formulated in (1) is relatively simple and clear, but it also faces a number of problems
in addition to the sufficiency problem. </p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd> Physicalism is true at a possible world <em>w</em> iff any world
which is a physical duplicate of <em>w</em> is a duplicate of
<em>w</em> <em>simpliciter</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p> 
These are: (a) the lone
ammonium molecule problem; (b) the modal status problem; (c) the
epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem; (d) the blockers problem; and (e) the
necessity problem.  This supplement discusses these problems. </p>



<h3><a id="LonAmmMolPro">1. The lone ammonium molecule problem</a></h3>

<p>(Cf. Kim 1993.) Imagine a possible world <em>W*</em> that is physically
exactly like our world except in one trivial respect: it has one extra
ammonium molecule located, say, on Saturn&rsquo;s rings. It is natural to
suppose that at <em>W*</em>, the distribution of mental properties is
exactly as it is in the actual world &mdash; the presence of an extra
molecule does not make that much of a difference. On the other hand,
for all (1) says, such a world might be <em>radically different</em> in
terms of the distribution of mental properties. Since (1) only refers
to worlds that are exact physical duplicates of our world, it
is silent on worlds that are different <em>even in minute details</em>,
and hence is silent on <em>W*</em>. It thus leaves open the possibility
that, in <em>W*</em>, everything has mental properties, or nothing has
or the only things that have mental properties are Saturn&rsquo;s rings! But
that seems absurd: while <em>W*</em> is clearly not a physical
duplicate of our world, for it contains an extra molecule, the
distribution of mental properties in <em>W*</em> would nevertheless
match that of the actual world. </p>

<p>

There are a number of different responses to this problem
in the literature (cf. Kim 1993). Perhaps the simplest response is
that the problem conflates two issues that are better kept apart: the
question of what physicalism itself tells us about <em>W*</em>, and the
question of what our general knowledge tells us about <em>W*</em>. It
is true that physicalism itself does not tell us anything about the
distribution of mental properties at <em>W*</em>. Nevertheless, we know
independently what the distribution is &mdash; we know independently that
the presence or absence of molecules on Saturn doesn&rsquo;t affect things
like who has mental properties here on Earth. But why should one assume
that this last piece of knowledge should be a consequence of
physicalism? To put the point slightly differently, imagine that we
discover that who has mental properties on Earth <em>is</em> in part a
function of the behavior of molecules on Saturn. That would of course
tell us that we are deeply wrong in our assumptions about how the world
works. But it would not tell us that we are deeply wrong about
physicalism. (For further discussion of this point, see Paull and Sider
1992, and Stalnaker 1996.)</p>

<h3><a id="ModStaPro">2. The modal status problem</a></h3>

<p>Some philosophers (e.g. Davidson 1970) have thought of physicalism
as a conceptual or necessary truth, if it is true at all. But most
have thought of it as contingent, a truth about our world which might
have been otherwise. The statement of physicalism encoded in (1)
allows a way in which this might be so. (1) tells us that physicalism
is true at a world just in case the world in question conforms to
certain conditions. But it leaves it open whether or not the actual
world conforms to those conditions <em>as a matter of
fact</em>. Perhaps it is <em>not</em> true of our world that a
physical duplicate of it would be a psychological duplicate. If so,
physicalism would not be true at our world. </p>

<p>
But for some it is puzzling that physicalism is stated using modal
notions and nonetheless is contingent. To see the problem, suppose as
that <em>S</em> is a statement which specifies the
physical nature of the actual world and <em>S*</em> is a statement
which specifies the total nature of the world. If
supervenience physicalism is true, the following entailment thesis will also be true: </p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(E)</dt>
<dd><em>S</em> entails <em>S*</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>On the other hand, (E) is clearly a necessary truth. However, if
(E) is a necessary truth, how can <em>physicalism</em> be contingent?
After all, (E) seems equivalent to physicalism. But if the two are
equivalent, how can one be necessary and the other contingent? </p>

<p>

However, while (E) is
necessary, it is <em>not</em> equivalent to physicalism. Rather,
(E) <em>follows</em> from physicalism given various contingent
assumptions, in particular the assumptions that <em>S</em> and
<em>S*</em> <em>are</em> the statements we say they are &mdash; it is
contingent fact, for example that <em>S*</em> summarizes the total
nature of the world. It is important here to distinguish (E) from a different entailment thesis that we discuss in the text (&ldquo;the physical
truths entail all the truths&rdquo;).  This thesis <em>is</em> plausibly equivalent to
physicalism but it is <em>not</em> necessary. (Not all entailment claims are necessary. Consider
&lsquo;my aunt&rsquo;s favorite statement entails my uncle&rsquo;s
favorite&rsquo; &mdash; that statement is contingent even though it is
most naturally thought of as an entailment claim.)</p>

<h3><a id="EpiEctPro">3. The epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem</a></h3>

<p>(Cf. Horgan 1983, Lewis 1983.) Imagine a possible world <em>W</em> that
is exactly like our world in respect of the distribution of physical
and mental properties, but for one difference: it contains some pure
experience which does not interact causally with anything else in the
world &mdash; <em>epiphenomenal ectoplasm</em>, to give it a name. The
problem this possibility presents for (1) is that, if (1) provides the
correct definition of physicalism, and if physicalism is true at the
actual world, then there is <em>no</em> possible world of the kind we
just described, i.e., <em>W</em> does not exist. The reason is that
<em>W</em> is by assumption a physical duplicate of our world; but
then, if physicalism is true at our world, <em>W</em> should be a
duplicate simpliciter of our world. But <em>W</em> is patently not a
duplicate of our world: it contains some epiphenomenal ectoplasm that
our world lacks. On the other hand, it seems quite wrong to say that
<em>W</em> is an impossibility &mdash; at any rate, physicalism should not
<em>entail</em> that it is impossible. </p>

<p>

In order to solve the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem, we need to
adjust (1) so that it does not have the truth of physicalism ruling out
<em>W</em> as a possible world. While there are a number of different
proposals about how to do this, one influential proposal is due to Frank Jackson
(cf. Jackson 1993. For earlier proposals and further discussion, see
Horgan 1983 and Lewis 1983.) He proposes replacing (1) with:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(1*)</dt>
<dd> Physicalism is true at a possible world <em>w</em> iff
any world which is a minimal physical duplicate of <em>w</em> is a
duplicate of <em>w</em> <em>simpliciter</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>By &lsquo;minimal physical duplicate&rsquo;, Jackson means a possible
world that is identical in all physical respects to the actual world,
but which does not contain anything else; in particular, it does not
contain any epiphenomenal ectoplasm. Unlike (1), (1*) does not have
physicalism ruling out <em>W</em>, and so (1*) is on the face of it preferable to (1) as
a statement of physicalism, though we don&rsquo;t need to be concerned with this in the main text.</p>

<p> 

A different proposal is due to David Chalmers (1996). He proposes
replacing (1) with:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(1**)</dt>
<dd>Physicalism is true at a possible world <em>w</em> iff
any world which is a physical duplicate of <em>w</em> is a
positive duplicate of <em>w</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>By &lsquo;positive duplicate&rsquo;, Chalmers means a possible
world that instantiates all the positive properties of the actual
world, where in turn a positive property is defined as
&ldquo;one that if instantiated in a world W, is also
instantiated by the corresponding individual in all worlds that
contain W as a proper part&rdquo; (1996, p. 40).
Unlike (1), and like (1*), (1**) does not have physicalism ruling
out <em>W</em>, and so (1**) is on the face of it too preferable to (1)
as a statement of physicalism, though again we do not need to be concerned with this in the main text. </p>

<h3><a id="BloPro">4. The blockers problem</a></h3>
<p>(Cf. Hawthorne 2002, Leuenberger 2008) Imagine a possible world
similar to ours with respect to the distribution of mental and
physical properties, except for this difference: the relation between
physical facts and mental facts is weaker than
supervenience&mdash;mental facts are entailed by physical facts so
long as there are no facts which block that entailment&mdash;blockers,
as they are called.  For example, being in an overall physical
condition P will necessitate being in pain so long as you do not also
instantiate some further property B.  If you are in both P and B you
are not in pain; but if you are in P and not in B, you will be in
pain.</p>
  
<p>The problem that this possibility raises for supervenience
definitions of physicalism is as follows.  Let us suppose that the
relation obtaining at a world <em>W</em> between the mental and the
physical is one of weak necessity as just defined; that is, suppose
that, at <em>W</em>, the mental is necessitated by the physical but
only if certain blockers are absent.  Intuitively it would seem that
physicalism is false at <em>W</em>.  On the other hand, if physicalism
is defined in the way suggested by Jackson it would be true. After
all, applied to <em>W</em>, Jackson&rsquo;s definition says that physicalism
is true at <em>W</em> just in case any minimal physical duplicate
of <em>W</em> is a duplicate simpliciter.  But that seems to be true
of <em>W</em> as we have imagined it.  Conclusion: if blockers are
possible, physicalism is false at <em>W</em>, and yet it should not be
false on Jackson&rsquo;s definition. </p>

<p>

There are a number of possible responses to the blockers problem.  One
is to resist the intuition that physicalism is false at <em>W</em> in
the circumstance described, even if we adopt Jackson&rsquo;s definition of
physicalism.  A different response is to adopt a formulation of
physicalism that is weaker than supervenience physicalism; this
strategy is pursued in Leuenberger 2008.  A third response is to say that
what the blockers problem brings out is that there is a
difference between two ways that physicalists have sought to respond
to the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem; in particular, if one adopts
(1**) rather than (1*) as one&rsquo;s response to the epiphenomenal ectoplasm
problem, this would have the advantage that it does not also face the
blockers problem.  For if the relation of the mental to the physical
that obtains at <em>W</em> is one of weak necessity, then not only is
physicalism false but it is also false that any world which is
a physical duplicate of <em>W</em> is a positive duplicate of <em>W</em>
&mdash; at some physical duplicate worlds, for example, there will be
no psychological properties at all.  None of these responses are
clearly correct however, and the proper treatment of the blockers
problem (and indeed of the epiphenomenal ectoplasm problem, of which
the blockers problem is a development) is an open question in the
literature. </p>

<h3><a id="NecPro">5. The necessity problem</a></h3>
<p>(Cf. Montero 2013) Imagine a possible world <em>W</em> which is
similar to ours with respect to the distribution of physical
properties, but with this difference: the chemical or biological
properties of <em>W</em> are fundamental and only bear a contingent
relation to its physical properties. Ideas of this sort, or at least
something like them, have been considered at different times in the
history of science; regardless of that, the possibility certainly
makes sense.</p>

<p> The problem this possibility presents for (1) is that it suggests
it does not articulate a necessary condition on physicalism&rsquo;s being
true, that supervenience is not necessary for physicalism. The
reasoning for this may be brought as follows.  First, if (1) is the
correct definition of physicalism, then physicalism is not true
at <em>W</em>: a world physically identical to <em>W</em> need not be
a world identical to it in all respects, since it might lack the
chemical or biological properties in question.  But, second,
physicalism plausibly <em>is</em> true at <em>W</em>.  After all,
there is no temptation to say that dualism of a traditional sort is
true at <em>W</em>; the psychological properties instantiated
in <em>W</em> are nothing over and above other properties instantiated
there.  Putting these together: contrary to (1) supervenience on the
physical is not necessary for physicalism.</p>
<p>One response to this argument questions whether physicalism is true
at <em>W</em>.  It may be that dualism of a traditional sort
is <em>not</em> true at <em>W</em>, but it doesn&rsquo;t quite follow that
physicalism <em>is</em> true there.  As we noted above, physicalism as
articulated by (1) is a thesis that applies to the world in
general. That very general thesis seems to be false at <em>W</em> even
if dualism is not, since chemical or biological properties are
fundamental there.  A different response to the argument turns on
issues we will look at again later, namely, how exactly to understand
the notion of the physical.  This argument against (1) assumes a
notion of the physical according to which chemical or biological
properties are non-physical. In response, a friend of (1) might say
they are interested in a broader notion on which these properties are
themselves physical. If that is defensible, the problem goes away.</p>

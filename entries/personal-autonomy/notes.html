 Frankfurt has modified his original account many times. Thus, for
example, he has responded to the sort of regress worries mentioned
later in the entry by appealing, first, to an agent&rsquo;s &ldquo;decisive
commitments,&rdquo; and more recently, to her &ldquo;satisfaction&rdquo;
with her motives -- an absence of  &ldquo;restlessness or
resistance&rdquo; in response to their motivating force. (Frankfurt
1999b)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 Whereas hierarchical accounts tend to reflect
sympathies with Hume&rsquo;s philosophy of mind, Watson explicitly allies
himself with Plato. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Caring, Jaworska explains, &ldquo;combines various individual emotions
into a complex structure, [synthesizing and organizing] disparate
elements of one&rsquo;s psychic life&rdquo; (Jaworska 2009, 92).  It is, she
continues, a sufficient basis for being a &ldquo;self&rdquo; that is
capable of &ldquo;autonomous self-governance.&rdquo; She notes, however,
that this is not enough to &ldquo;express autonomy in particular
choices&rdquo;(99).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>  Bernard Berofsky calls
attention to the fact that there is support &ldquo;across a broad
spectrum&rdquo; of theorizing in psychology and psychiatry for the
idea that certain inner states undermine autonomy by creating
&ldquo;barriers to objectivity.&rdquo; They do this, he explains, by
&ldquo;persisting in a way that removes them from experiential review
and the influence of newly acquired information.&rdquo; (Berofsky
1995, p. 199) Though Fischer and Ravizza, Wolf, and Nelkin argue that
responsiveness to reasons is necessary condition of <i>moral
responsibility</i>, in presenting and defending their views, they
suggest that unless an agent satisfies this condition, she does not
really govern herself. As Wolf puts it, they are interested in the
&ldquo;relation to one&rsquo;s will which is necessary in order for one&rsquo;s
actions &hellip; to be &lsquo;up to oneself&rsquo; in the way that is
necessary for responsibility.&rdquo; (4) (Note that Wolf reserves the
term &lsquo;autonomy&rsquo; for one particular conception of this
self-relation: the incompatibilist view that an agent&rsquo;s control over
her behavior must be &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; &mdash; that &ldquo;her
will must be determined by her self, and her self must not, in turn,
be determined by anything external to itself&rdquo; (10).) According
to Wolf, responsiveness to reasons is a necessary supplement to a
coherentist condition: &ldquo;a person&rsquo;s status as a responsible agent
rests not only on her ability to make her behavior conform to her
deepest values but also on her ability to form, assess, and revise
those values on the basis of a recognition and appreciation of
&hellip; the True and the Good.&rdquo; In stressing that an autonomous
agent &ldquo;must be in a position that allows her reasons to be
governed by what reasons there are&hellip; [i.e.,] by what is valuable
and worthless&rdquo; (117-118), Wolf evokes a tradition that goes back
to Plato. But she rejects the Platonic conception of values as
&ldquo;things&rdquo; that can be &ldquo;apprehended by some special
faculty&rdquo; (123). Fischer and Ravizza likewise try to steer clear
of controversial metaethical assumptions. &ldquo;Regular
reasons-receptivity&rdquo; is, they argue, essential to having
&ldquo;guidance control&rdquo; over one&rsquo;s action. &ldquo;It involves a
pattern of actual and hypothetical recognition of reasons (some of
which are moral reasons) that is understandable by some appropriate
external observer. And the pattern must be at least minimally grounded
in reality.&rdquo; (90) (For more on the metaphysics of reasons, see
note 10.) Unlike Wolf, Fischer and Ravizza do not think that reasons
responsiveness suffices for moral responsibility. They believe that in
order for an agent to &ldquo;own&rdquo; the reasons-responsive
mechanism that produces his action, he must &ldquo;take
responsibility&rdquo; for it. To do this, he must &ldquo;see himself
as an agent&rdquo; and &ldquo;accept that he is a fair target of the
reactive attitudes as a result of how he exercises this agency in
certain contexts&rdquo; (210-211). (For more on the relation between
moral responsibility and autonomy, see note 17.) </p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a> 
 The appeal of the reasons-responsive approach may also reflect a
failure to distinguish governing <em>oneself</em> from exercising
control over <em>one&rsquo;s life</em>.  Whether one&rsquo;s future circumstances
are likely to constrain the options one would like to have surely
depends on whether one&rsquo;s present actions are responsive to the reasons
for and against acting this way.  Even if, however, one cannot
exercise control over one&rsquo;s destiny if one lacks control over how one
acts at any given time, exercising control over how one acts is
perfectly compatible with making choices that leave one with very
limited options.  (The conception of autonomous agency as
a <em>capacity</em> for shaping one&rsquo;s <em>life as a whole</em>
features prominently in discussions of applied ethics.)
</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a> 
 On this view autonomy is &ldquo;achieved when the individual subjects
the norms with which he or she is confronted to critical evaluation
and then proceeds to reach practical decisions by way of independent
and rational reflection&rdquo; (Young 1986). In other words, one&rsquo;s
conduct is autonomous only if one exercises &ldquo;assorted
introspective, imaginative, reasoning, and volitional skills&rdquo;
(Meyers 1987). In refining and defending this conception, Mele argues
that an autonomous agent must be capable of reflecting critically upon
her desires, and of altering them in light of this
reflection. Similarly, Christman stresses the importance of the
autonomous agent&rsquo;s ability to reflect (in a &ldquo;minimally
rational&rdquo; way) on the process whereby she acquired a given
desire. He argues that someone acts autonomously when she is moved by
a given desire only if she would not reject the desire if she
reflected on its genesis.)  Some such procedural requirement is often
grafted onto coherentist accounts. Thus, in his early work, Gerald
Dworkin argues that someone who identifies with his motives lacks
autonomy if this identification reflects the fact that he has
&ldquo;been influenced in decisive ways by others in such a fashion
that we are not prepared to think of it as his own choice&rdquo;
(Dworkin 1976, 25). (In later work, Dworkin suggests that an
autonomous agent need not actually identify with her motives as long
as she is capable of altering her preferences in light of her
uncompelled reflection. (Dworkin 1988, 17)) </p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a> 
 As Dworkin puts it, what is necessary for autonomy is &ldquo;some
ability both to alter one&rsquo;s preferences and to make them effective in
one&rsquo;s actions&rdquo; (Dworkin 1988).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
In discussing this phenomenon, Frankfurt coins the term
&ldquo;volitional necessity.&rdquo; He believes that the experience of
being incapable of willing to do otherwise is not only compatible with
governing one&rsquo;s own actions, but is the best indication of where one
stands, and so is the surest symptom that one is the power behind
one&rsquo;s exercise of authority.  See also note 15 and the associated
text.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Note that it is possible to endorse this response while rejecting the
assumption that reasoning is a mode of gaining access to an
independent order of reasons.  Kant argues, for example, that our
commitment to acting for reasons is a commitment to accepting certain
principles of reasoning as constraints on what we have reason to do.
On this account, whatever moves us to reason in a way that violates
these principles prevents us from appreciating the reason-giving force
of certain facts. But on this account, we fail to govern ourselves
when we fail to respond to these reasons only because responding to
these reasons just is responding to demands we impose on
ourselves. (One point of clarification is worth adding to this overly
brief summary: In order to avoid the implication that no one is
accountable for doing things she has good reason <em>not</em> to do,
Kant appeals to the wrongdoer&rsquo;s ungrounded choice to defy the laws of
her own reason.  (See Kant 1793) Similar concerns push some
reasons-responsive theorists closer to the incompatibilist position
mentioned later in the entry.  Thus, for example, Wolf argues that no
one is accountable for her failure to respond to reasons if her action
was causally determined by conditions over which she had no
control. (Wolf 1980).)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>  
 Relational accounts generally focus less on the constituents of
autonomous agency than on the conditions under which it is possible
for someone to be an autonomous agent.  But some philosophers who
appeal to the importance of social relations argue that we cannot
distinguish the mental states that are internal to an agent&rsquo;s point of
view from those that are external without appealing to her social
relations (see, for example, Oshana); and some of these philosophers
stress, in particular, the role that a shared understanding of what is
important plays in determining whether the influence of a given
attitude or standing disposition is attributable to the agent herself
(Anderson 2003).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>  Much of the debate
over the relationship between causal determinism, on the one hand, and
autonomy, free will, and moral responsibility, on the other, focuses
on the modal argument that is at the heart of van Inwagen&rsquo;s defense of
incompatibilism. According to this argument, no one is accountable for
what she does if her action is causally determined by past conditions
over which she had no control.  On Kane&rsquo;s account, the desire to be an
autonomous agent is the desire to have &ldquo;the power to be the
ultimate producers of [one&rsquo;s] own ends&hellip; the power to make
choices which can only and finally be explained in terms of [one&rsquo;s]
own [will] (i.e., character, motives, and efforts of will).&rdquo;
&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; he argues, &ldquo;can have this power in a
determined world.&rdquo; (254)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a> 
 According to Velleman, intentions are a special sort of
belief that the agent has the power to make true. &ldquo;Our
expectation of doing something embodies an invention rather than a
discovery. For we can simply adopt the expectation that we&rsquo;re going to
do any one of the things for which we have some antecedent motives,
and this expectation will modify the balance of forces so as to make
itself true. We are thus in a position to make up our forthcoming
behavior. Making up what we will do is, in fact, our way of making up
our minds to do it.&rdquo; (24)Without endorsing Velleman&rsquo;s suggestion
that reasons for action are ultimately explanatory reasons, Anderson
and Lux also defend a knowledge criterion of autonomy. An agent, they
argue, is not &ldquo;genuinely self-governing&rdquo; if she does not
understand &ldquo;the extent to which [she] has the capacities
required&rdquo; to do what she intends to do. (Anderson and Lux)
 </p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Attempts to make sense of weakness of will go back to Plato and
Aristotle. For some more recent discussions, see Davidson 1980, Watson
1977, Bratman 1979, Mele 1995, Buss 1997 and Stroud and Tappolet
2003.  (Recently, Richard Holton has pointed out that there is a familiar
conception of weakness of will according to which it is not a failure
to conform to one&rsquo;s contemporaneous all-things-considered evaluative
judgment but a failure to follow through on an earlier resolution.
(See Holton 1999)) </p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a> 
 The example is Frankfurt&rsquo;s (Frankfurt 2002b). The mother, he says, may
be &ldquo;glad to be putting her need for the relationship above what
is best by a measure that she now refuses to regard as decisive&rdquo;
(163). More generally, Frankfurt argues that &ldquo;the fact that
something is important to someone is a circumstance that naturally has
its causes, but it may neither originate in, nor be at all supported
by, reasons. It may simply be a brute fact, which is not derived from
any assessment or appreciation whatever&rdquo;
(161). &ldquo;Suppose,&rdquo; Frankfurt elsewhere writes, &ldquo;I
were to conclude for some reason that it is not desirable for me to
seek the well-being of my children. I suspect that I would continue to
love them and to care about their well-being anyhow. This discrepancy
between my judgment and my desire would not show that I had become
alienated from the desire.&rdquo; (Frankfurt 2002, 223) For a thorough
discussion of Frankfurt&rsquo;s position, see Watson 2002. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>  Velleman has expressed
reservations about identifying the constitutive aim of rational agency
with the disposition to govern one&rsquo;s own behavior.  But Christine
Korsgaard has defended this Kantian idea. (See Korsgaard 2009.) For a
very brief comment on the role that the commitment to being governed
by reason plays in Kant&rsquo;s own account, see note 10.  Note the very
special sense in which, according to Kant, no rational agent can
dissociate herself from this commitment: she cannot do so without
contradicting herself. </p>

<div id="note-16">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 This is not an entry on moral responsibility.  As earlier references
and the bibliography indicate, however, there is an intimate
connection between moral responsibility and the phenomenon under
discussion here: the minimal conditions of self-governing actions --
the conditions that distinguish these actions from everything else we
intentionally do -- are the conditions an agent must satisfy in
order to be accountable for the motivating force of whatever
psychological states causally determine her intentions.  This means
that insofar as debates about the necessary conditions of moral
responsibility are not debates about the conditions under which a
morally responsible agent is blameworthy or praiseworthy for what she
does, they are central to the topic of this entry.  If philosophers
suggest otherwise, this is because they are not talking about the
minimal conditions under which agents qualify as
&ldquo;self-governing&rdquo; (see Fischer 2012) and/or because they do
not believe that there is any metaphysical condition on moral
responsibility.  According to the second alternative, whether someone
is praiseworthy or blameworthy does not depend on whether she has
determined her own action in some special way.  (For a highly
influential defense of this position, see Strawson, P.F.  See also note 18.) </p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a> 
 Note that to <em>be</em> &ldquo;accountable&rdquo; is not necessarily
to satisfy the conditions that justify others in <em>holding</em> one
accountable.  As Gary Watson points out, holding someone accountable
for wrongdoing involves reacting adversely to this person; and this
means that whether one is justified in holding someone accountable
depends on whether it is fair to react adversely to what she does.
The answer to this question may depend on more than whether she
governs her action.  It may depend, for example, on whether she has
the conceptual capacities we expect a moral agent to exercise.  (See
Watson 2004) Note further that some philosophers (most notably
P. F. Strawson) have argued that there is no important conception of
accountability according to which the judgment that someone is
praiseworthy or blameworthy presupposes the further judgment that she
has determined her own action in some special way.  This skepticism
appears to be supported by the very concerns raised in this section:
if we cannot spell out the special metaphysical condition that renders
agents accountable for their actions, then it is tempting to conclude
that whether someone is accountable for her actions is not a
metaphysical matter after all.  (For an exploration of the Strawsonian
approach to moral responsibility, see Watson 1993.  For a more recent
attempt to develop a Strawsonian approach, see Wallace 1994.  See also
Arpaly 2006.)
</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>  Buss 2012 responds to
the challenge identified here with an account that differs from the
four highlighted in this entry.  On this account, whether the causal
influences on an agent&rsquo;s reasoning are attributable to the agent
herself depends on whether they satisfy a normative condition: an
agent is prevented from governing herself only if she forms her
intention under the decisive influence of mental states that are at
odds with her identity as a representative human being; and a mental
state satisfies this condition if and only if its influence tends to
be at odds with the conditions under which human beings function
minimally well.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a> 
 Thomas Reid is an early champion of this approach. For an attempt to
work out a rigorous incompatibilist conception of autonomy that does
not appeal to the notion of agent causation, see Kane 1996.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Some psychologists believe that the experimental evidence supports
this hypothesis: the experience as of being in control of our actions
is, they claim, an illusion; by the time it seems to us that we are
initiating an action, the physiological events that suffice to cause
this action have already occurred.  (For the classic experiments, see
Libet, Gleason, Wright, and Pearl 1983; Libet, Wright, and Gleason
1983; and Libet 1985.  For a more recent argument along these lines,
see Wegner 2002.)  This interpretation of the data can be challenged
in various ways.  (See, for example, Mele 2004, 2009) Perhaps more
importantly, even if the experience as of governing one&rsquo;s action were
illusory, the causal story of how we come to be mistaken would not
address the conceptual issue addressed in this entry: what sort of
self-relation is necessary and sufficient for governing
ourselves? </p>

 See Kant 1785. As Bok explains,</p>

<blockquote>

When I act for reasons, the events that cause me to act as I do might
be external to me, but the reasons that I regard as determining what I
do cannot be. For while, qua event, my acceptance of some reason for
action might or might not ultimately be caused by something outside
myself, in regarding it as a reason for action I must regard it as
having a justification that is independent of those causes. This
justification might at various points appeal to theoretical
claims. But I cannot regard it, qua justification, as having been
produced or foisted on me by any natural event. When I consider it as
a justification, I consider not its causal origins but its rational
grounds; and I accept or reject it on that basis. When I explain what
leads me to accept it, I will adduce not the causes that led me to do
so, but the reasons that convinced me that it was sound. Because any
reasons I adduce must themselves be reasons I accept, this type of
explanation will not ultimately lead me to adduce determining factors
that I do not regard as my own. (206)

</blockquote>

For essentially the same point in a less Kantian context, see
D.M. McKay 1960 and 1973, and Hampshire 1983. Like others, they point
out that the question &ldquo;How will A act?&rdquo; has no determinate
answer for A until she decides how to act. What is a simple fact from
the perspective of a third-person observer is not a fact from the
perspective of the agent herself. Similarly, David Velleman argues
that the freedom that counts where autonomous agency is concerned is
epistemic freedom with respect to one&rsquo;s alternatives. (Velleman 2000)
</p>

<p>
This essential formal feature of the practical point of view is at the
center of most existentialist conceptions of human agency. Thus, for
example, Jean-Paul Sartre claims that &ldquo;[M]otives are only for
consciousness. And due to the very fact that the motive can arise only
as appearance, it constitutes itself as ineffective. &hellip;
[C]onsciousness is not subject to it because of the very fact that
consciousness posits it; for consciousness has now the task of
conferring on the motive its meaning and its importance.&rdquo; (Sartre
1956, 71)</p>

 As note 17 indicates, this difficulty is closely related to the
difficulty of identifying necessary and sufficient conditions of moral
responsibility.  Many philosophers have responded to the latter challenge by
rejecting the assumption that our interest in moral responsibility is
an interest in a single phenomenon.  Since Watson 1996, there has been
considerable discussion of the relationship between (1) the claim that
an action is &ldquo;attributable to&rdquo; an agent; (2) the claim that
an agent is &ldquo;answerable for&rdquo; her action and (3) the claim
that an agent is &ldquo;accountable for&rdquo; her action. (See, for
example, Shoemaker 2012.) Many philosophers believe that the range of
answers people give to survey questions also challenge the assumption
that &ldquo;moral responsibility&rdquo; is &ldquo;a unified
concept.&rdquo; (See Doris, Knobe, &amp; Woolfolk, Knobe and Doris.  For a
summary of, and response to, this interpretation of the survey
results, see Nelkin 2007.)  Disagreements on this point complicate
disagreements over particular accounts of moral responsibility.
Though this entry does not address these disagreements, it does assume
that there is a special sense in which only autonomous actions can be
attributed to those who perform them, and it assumes that agents whose
acts are attributable to them in this sense (and only such agents) are
accountable for what they do. (Note that it does not follow that
attributability is sufficient for punishing wrongdoing&mdash;or
even expressing negative attitudes to the one who does wrong.  Other
considerations will be relevant to whether this sort of reaction is
justified.)</p>

<h2>A Fundamental Problem about Hylomorphism</h2>

<p>

If we rely on a simple illustration of Aristotle&rsquo;s hylomorphism,
then, as Ackrill (1972&ndash;3) first pointed out, we come with surprising
rapidity to a significant problem for Aristotle&rsquo;s otherwise attractive
treatment of soul-body relations. According to Aristotle&rsquo;s hylomorphic
analysis of change and generation, when a lump of bronze comes to be
enformed with the shape of Hermes, a statue of Hermes comes into
existence. When this same bronze is later melted and recast as a statue
of Domitian, then the Hermes statue goes out of existence and a statue
of Domitian comes into existence. Crucial to this simple account of
hylomorphic generation is the thought that the bronze which first
acquires and then loses one shape (the Hermes shape) and then acquires
a new shape (the Domitian shape) is itself only contingently enformed
by either shape. We speak of the lump or quantity of bronze as
continuing through the entire process; and this seems plausible, since
the bronze itself has no one shape essentially. Perhaps it is
essentially bronze or essentially metal, but it is not essentially
either Hermes- or Domitian-shaped.</p>

<p>

So it seems that any matter which underlies generation is only
contingently enformed by the form which it acquires in the process of
generation. Now, though, comes an oddness for hylomorphism in the case
of soul-body relations: Aristotle evidently thinks that a human body is
essentially enformed by the soul whose body it is. That is, unlike
bronze, a body, the matter of a human being, cannot lose its form, its
soul, and remain in existence. This, at any rate, seems to be a direct
consequence of Aristotle&rsquo;s insisting that a body which has lost its
soul is not a body at all, &lsquo;except homonymously&rsquo; (<em>De
Anima</em> ii 1, 412b10&ndash;24). In appealing to homonymy in this
connection, Aristotle means to suggest that a body without a soul is no
more a body than an eye in a sculpture of a human being is an eye. We
do call it an eye, but only by an extension of the term. An eye in a
sculpture or in a painting hanging on a wall in a museum is not really
an eye; it is not an organ used for seeing. So Aristotle&rsquo;s suggestion
is that a dead body, or a corpse, is more like a statue of a body than
it is like a real body. It looks like a body, perhaps, but it is not,
in fact, a body at all. This is presumably why Aristotle says of such a
body: &ldquo;The body which has lost its soul is not the one which is
potentially alive; this is rather the one which has a soul&rdquo; (<em>De
Anima</em> ii 1 412b25&ndash;26). The purport is evidently that <em>only</em>
a body already ensouled is potentially alive. That makes a body unlike
a lump of bronze, which may be potentially a statue while it is yet in
fact a lump and not a statue, something, that is, patently unenformed
by the form of any statue at all. Indeed, that was supposed to be
matter&rsquo;s principal virtue in Aristotle&rsquo;s hylomorphic account of
generation.</p>

<p>

Now, whatever Aristotle&rsquo;s motives for appealing to homonymy in this
connection may be, it should first be appreciated that it has immediate
and problematic consequences for his hylomorphic analysis of soul and
body. For it entails that no human body is contingently ensouled;
rather, every human body is essentially ensouled and goes out of
existence at the moment it loses its soul, that is, at the moment of
death. This will seem counterintuitive, insofar as it seems peculiar to
speak of a human body as ceasing to exist at the moment of death. We
say, after all, that many citizens in the Soviet Union made a special
effort to view &lsquo;Lenin&rsquo;s body&rsquo; on display in Moscow, or that
&lsquo;King Tut&rsquo;s body&rsquo; was preserved through mummification.
Perhaps, though, one might agree that all this is just a manner of
speaking, that a body embalmed and laid out for viewing or a body
carted around to various museums for display is more like a statue than
it is like the breathing organism belonging to a live human. This is
not, however, the real problem noticed by Ackrill. It is rather that
the hylomorphic account of change seems to require that bits of matter
are only contingently enformed; the bronze is not made the bronze it is
by gaining this or that shape. Instead, the bronze is the bronze it is
because of its being an alloy of copper and tin, something it was
before it was enformed by the shape of Hermes, something it remains
while enformed by that shape, and, of course, something it is still
after that shape has been lost. If human bodies are not bodies when
they are not ensouled, and if the souls of bodies are, as Aristotle
claims, their forms, then human bodies are not amenable to a
hylomorphic treatment. The application of a general hylomorphic
framework to the case of the soul and body does not even seem possible.
Matter, according to hylomorphism, is contingently enformed; so,
bodies, treated by Aristotle as matter, should also be contingently
enformed. If, however, bodies are only homonymously bodies when they
have lost their souls, then bodies are necessarily enformed: bodies are
necessarily actually alive. So, human bodies are both contingently and
necessarily enformed. That seems an unhappy and rather immediate
consequence. In fact, Aristotle seems to have contradicted himself.</p>

<p>

In view of this seemingly contradictory outcome, it is natural to
wonder why Aristotle claims in the first instance that a human body is
only homonymously a body when it has lost its soul. For surely it is
that claim which is the root of his difficulty; it is precisely his
appeal to homonymy which renders an application of hylomorphism to
soul-body relations problematic. Perhaps, then, the easiest solution
would be for Aristotle simply to retract his claim that a body without
a soul is not a body at all, except homonymously. Then a human body
could be, like other parcels of matter, only contingently enformed.</p>

<p>

Unfortunately, there seems little hope of Aristotle&rsquo;s simply
rescinding his claim that a dead body is not a body except
homonymously. For he regularly employs a broad thesis of functional
determination, according to which &ldquo;all things are defined by
their function&rdquo; (<em>Meteorologica</em> iv 12, 390a10&ndash;15; cf.
<em>Generation of Animals</em> ii 1,734b24&ndash;31; <em>Politics</em> i 2,
1253a19&ndash;25). This thesis states necessary and sufficient conditions for
something&rsquo;s being a member of some kind <em>F</em> such that all and
only <em>F</em> things manifest the function characteristic of that
kind. (So, for instance, something is a computer if and only if it can
be used to do the things computers do. No piece of salami is a
computer; and everything which can be used to word process, create
spread sheets, and in general to implement software programs is a
computer.) The upshot of this approach to kind individuation for the
body seems to be that nothing incapable of engaging in the life
functions characteristic of human beings (eating, perceiving, thinking)
will be a human body. This is why a body without a soul, a body which
is completely lifeless, is not a human body, except homonymously. This
is also why a soulless body is more like a statue or a painting of a
body than it is like a human body. Although it may look like a body, a
corpse can no more breathe than a statue can walk about and perceive.
So, Aristotle is not at liberty to revoke his appeal to homonymy, at
least not without sacrificing a deep principle of kind
individuation.</p>

<p>

That leaves, then, only one direction for resolving the
contradiction which seems to result from the combination of
hylomorphism and homonymy. Aristotle can allow, perhaps, that in
addition to the human body which is necessarily actually alive there is
a body which is only contingently ensouled and so only contingently
alive. This body would presumably be the sort of matter Aristotle
characterizes as <em>non-proximate</em> (<em>Metaphysics</em> v 6,
1016a19&ndash;24; viii 4, 1044a15&ndash;25; ix 7, 1049a24&ndash;7). Non-proximate matter
is the matter which undergirds the matter actually used in the
generation of some compound, even if it is not actually present or
discernible in that compound. Thus, for example, while bricks and
mortar are the proximate matter of the house, the clay which is the
matter of the bricks is also, though non-proximately, the matter of the
house, since it was used as the matter for the formation of the bricks.
Although it is not so obvious in the case of a living being, whose
proximate matter is already very highly structured, beneath the
proximate matter will lie non-proximate matter which can then be only
contingently enformed. That matter is not necessarily actually alive.
This would also be the matter implicitly contrasted with what Aristotle
identifies as the <em>organic</em> matter (<em>De Anima</em> ii 1,
412a28&ndash;b1), that is, the fully formed and living human matter, of an
existing human being. The non-organic matter could then qualify as what
continues through hylomorphic generation, in the way bronze persists
through the loss and acquisition of various forms. So, there will be
effectively two bodies, one organic and one non-organic, the first of
which is indeed necessarily actually alive but the second of which is
not. Perhaps the distinction between the organic and non-organic body
parallels to some extent our own different ways of speaking of &ldquo;flesh&rdquo;.
We might say that <em>flesh repairs itself when cut or damaged</em>,
though obviously this is said only of <em>living</em> flesh, even while
we also speak of corruptible things as <em>going the way of all
flesh</em> . In the first instance only we implicitly restrict
ourselves to speaking of the sort of flesh which is living flesh. So
too, then, with the organic body: it is a living body of which we
speak, though there is also a body, the non-organic body, which goes
the way of all flesh.</p>

<p>

This solution may seem in one way or another extravagant,
unparsimonious, or simply at variance with common sense. These are
reservations which are fairly voiced and investigated; they evidently
begin, however, by conceding that Aristotle need not buckle before a
charge of self-contradiction. So, the hylomorphic project he initiates
remains at least that much of an open possibility. In any case, it
retains whatever advantages the general hylomorphic framework employed
may carry with it. To be sure, though, the worry generated by Ackrill&rsquo;s
problem is a deep one, with multifaceted ramifications for our
understanding and eventual assessment of Aristotle&rsquo;s hylomorphic
program in philosophy of mind.</p>

<h2>Ryle on Imagination</h2>

<p>

Picturing, visualizing, imagining, &ldquo;seeing (a cat) with the
mind&rsquo;s eye&rdquo;, and &ldquo;hearing (a tune) in one&rsquo;s
head&rdquo; are useful concepts; operations of imagining, picturing,
visualizing, and the like are exercises of mental powers (232). 
Do these operations require objects: those philosophical posits known
as visual or auditory &ldquo;images&rdquo;, &ldquo;ideas&rdquo;, or
&ndash; as they are called today &ndash;
&ldquo;representations&rdquo;? If so, the mind would be the
obvious repository, container, or vehicle of pictorial or auditory
&ldquo;content&rdquo;. But such mental operations do not require
such objects. </p>

<blockquote>

Much as stage-murders do not have victims and are not murders, so
seeing things in one&rsquo;s mind&rsquo;s eye does not involve either
the existence of things seen nor the occurrence of acts of seeing them.
(232)</blockquote>

<p>

If, to accommodate imaginings we need not posit ideas or images
then, &ldquo;there is thus no need to treat minds as the clandestine
habitats of such fleshless beings&rdquo; (232). Nor, we might add, is
there need to treat the brain or central nervous system as the physical
realization of this habitat or, in the current idiom, as vehicles of
content.</p>

<p>

The question how one can seem to hear a cat&rsquo;s purr or seem to
see an Egyptian Mau when there are no purrs to be heard or cats to be
seen has the form, Ryle says, of a &ldquo;wires and pulleys&rdquo;
question. But if we examine the way the expression, say,
&ldquo;she fancied or she imagined she saw an Egyptian Mau&rdquo;
works, we will see that we have no trouble using or understanding this
expression; we know the kind of circumstances in which it is
appropriate or not; in which it would be confirmed or challenged, and
none of this requires theoretical knowledge or knowledge of causal
processes. The meaning of this expression does not require that we ask
the question that a theory of mental mechanisms or of mental causation
would answer. Nor, incidentally and <em>a fortiori</em>, does it
require a theory of mental mechanisms or of mental causation whose
mysteriousness is salved by a theory about the mechanisms&rdquo;
alleged physical realizers. The problem, as far as it is one,
says Ryle, is to construe descriptions of people as imagining that they
see or hear or do things &ldquo;without falling back on the idioms in
which we talk of seeing horse-races, hearing concerts, or committing
murders&rdquo; (238). In the same way that saying someone has
committed a stage-murder or a mock-murder &ldquo;is to say, not that a
certain mild or faint murder has been committed, but that no sort of
murder has been committed&rdquo;, to say that someone imagines seeing
an Egyptian Mau is not to say that she sees an Egyptian Mau-image or,
we might add, that she has a mental representation of an Egyptian Mau
(which counts as non-veridical, say, because it is not the causal
effect of a real one) but rather to say that she does not see an
Egyptian Mau or anything cat-like at all. (238)</p>

<h3>A. Pretend Actions</h3>

<p>

The question, &ldquo;How can a person fancy he sees something
without realizing that he is not seeing it?&rdquo; seems to call out
for a philosophically deep explanation. But this appearance
fades, Ryle explains, when we realize that pretence is a notion partly
constitutive of notions such as cheating, acting a part, make-believe,
shamming being ill, and hypochondria. While cheating requires
awareness of the deception, make-believe allows for various degrees of
credulity and incredulity, and hypochondria demands being taken in by
one&rsquo;s own fancy. So the question how one can fancy seeing
something should be compared with the question how one can fancy that
one has a virus. The answer is not to be found by postulating vivid
ideas but rather by noting the general fact that not all people are as
judicial and as critical as one might wish.</p>

<p>

Pretending does not require a second, hidden operation (planning,
imaging, deliberating) accompanying or shadowing that which one is
pretending to do. Forging a check involves nothing more&mdash;that is,
no extra events or occurrences&mdash;than signing it. Forging a
cheque requires (in a logical sense and not a causal one) the
&ldquo;thought&rdquo; of genuinely signing it. In one sense the
acts of signing and forging a cheque may be indistinguishable, and in
that sense involve &ldquo;the same&rdquo; act; in another, they are not
the same, for the <em>description</em> of the forgery will operate with
a different battery of predicates and subordinate clauses. 
Pretending is a sophisticated performance which is parasitic on the
naivety or naturalness of the original one. </p>

<h3>B. Fancied Perceptions</h3>

<p>

&ldquo;Imagine&rdquo; and &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; sometimes have a
different nuance from &ldquo;pretend&rdquo; and &ldquo;act the
part&rdquo;, for whereas the latter terms are applied to activities
that usually (but not always) have some overt &ldquo;muscular&rdquo;
representation, the former are often reserved for things people do
inaudibly and invisibly &ldquo;in their heads&rdquo;. 
&ldquo;Fancy&rdquo; and &ldquo;imagine&rdquo;, that is, are often used
to characterize a person&rsquo;s fancied perceptions &ndash; which may
have no muscular or behavioural manifestations.</p>

<p>

Thus, even if we agree that forging a cheque involves going through
motions in a hypothetical manner, what motions would there be in the
case of fancied perceptions? Hearing Bach&rsquo;s
<em>Chaconne</em> running through one&rsquo;s head is not like
listening to a private reproduction or internal echo of the
partita. This tilts against the common idea in epistemology that
a mental picture or visual image (or, we might add, a mental
representation) stands to visual sensation as an echo to noise or a
reflection stands to that which is reflected. On this traditional
view, what is common between seeing and &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; is the
existence of an image or mental representation, minus the cognitive
element or judgment thought to be required for perception. But
this, says, Ryle gets things the wrong way around. I may hear
Bach&rsquo;s <em>Chaconne</em> for Violin Solo played by Itzhak Perlman
without knowing how it goes, but it is absurd to say that I
&ldquo;hear&rdquo; it running through my head without knowing how it
goes. Hearing in one&rsquo;s mind, far from being a matter of
having auditory sensations minus knowledge, is rather a species of
knowledge-how. In hearing the <em>Chaconne</em> in my mind, I am
exercising my knowledge of how the piece goes; I am, in a certain way,
realizing what I would be hearing if it were really being played, in
the same way that the forger, in forging a cheque, is realizing how it
would be signed if the cheque were genuine. Picturing or fancying
in my mind&rsquo;s eye what it would be to hear Perlman play does not
require that I see an image or have a visual sensation or experience
<em>sans</em> judgment, or anything that goes proxy it. Imagining
how Perlman would sound and look performing stands in the same relation
to hearing and watching him perform as forging a cheque stands to its
genuine signing. It is doing something which &ldquo;stands in the
same relation &hellip;as sophisticated performances stand to those more
na&iuml;ve performances, whose mention is obliquely contained in the
description of the higher order performances.&rdquo;
(252) </p>

<p>

Hearing the <em>Chaconne</em> running through my head, or seeing
Perlman in my mind&rsquo;s eye are fancied perceptions, not actions or
doings. Although fancied perceptions and mock-actions are both
species of knowledge-how, perception, unlike action, does not involve
bringing anything about. So fancied perception, far from being a
special private form of doing is not a doing at all. It makes no
sense to speak of witnessing or failing to witness a seeing or hearing;
thus it makes no sense to speak either way about fancied seeings or
fancied hearings.</p>

<p>

A similar story can be told for seeing things in one&rsquo;s head or
with the mind&rsquo;s eye. My imagining the gooseberry green eyes
of my cat, Vinzelles, does not involve having visual sensitivity to
them (or visual &ldquo;sensations&rdquo; of them) of the sort looking
at a photograph of him or directly into his face would. It
involves having the thought of looking at them in the logical sense
that imagining them is a more sophisticated operation than looking at
them. Imagining his green eyes is &ldquo;one utilization among
others of the knowledge of how&rdquo; the gooseberry green eyes look
(255). Picturing Vinzelles&rsquo;s gooseberry green eyes is
something like a rehearsal for having my expectation of what his eyes
look like fulfilled if I really were to look at them. So, far
from picturing involving, as Hume thought, faint sensations, &ldquo;it
involves missing just what one would be due to get&rdquo; if one were
really looking at them.</p>

<p>

The problem with Hume&rsquo;s theory of ideas and its predecessors
involve not only the idea of shadow sensations. It confuses the
logical dependence of picturing on seeing, or &ldquo;hearing&rdquo; on
hearing, with a causal dependence. Imaging or picturing involves
knowledge how things look or hear and not having forgotten. But
it does not require, what Hume seems to have thought, that in imagining
Vinzelles&rsquo;s gooseberry green eyes, his eyes have left a visual
sense impression that occurred when my eyes were open which cause or
bring about a faint sort of impression (or representation).</p>

<blockquote>

All that is required is to see that learning perceptual lessons
entails some perceiving, that applying those lessons entails having
learned them, and that imaging is one way of applying those
lessons. (257)</blockquote>

<p>
The <em>recursive functions</em> are a class of functions on the
natural numbers studied in <em>computability theory</em>, a branch of
contemporary mathematical logic which was originally known
as <em>recursive function theory</em>. Such functions take their name
from the process of <em>recursion</em> by which the value of a
function is defined by the application of the same function applied to
smaller arguments.</p>

<p>
This process may be illustrated by considering the familiar factorial
function \(x!\)&mdash;i.e., the function which returns the product \(1
\times 2 \times \ldots \times x\) if \(x &gt; 0\) and 1 otherwise. An
alternative recursive definition of this function is as follows: </p>

\[\begin{align}
\label{defnfact}
\fact(0) &amp; =  1 \\  \nonumber
\fact(x+1) &amp; =  (x+1) \times \fact(x) \end{align}\]

<p>
Such a definition might at first appear circular in virtue of the fact
that the value of \(\fact(x)\) on the left hand side is defined in
terms the same function on the righthand side. However a
characteristic feature of recursive definitions is that they allow for
the values of functions which they describe to be calculated by
successively &ldquo;unwinding&rdquo; the clause for \(x &gt; 0\) until
the clause for \(x = 0\) (the so-called <em>base case</em>) is
reached. For instance the value of \(fact(4)\) may be calculated using the preceding definition as follows:</p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{factcalc}
\fact(4) &amp;= 4 \times \fact(3) \\
&amp; = 4 \times (3 \times \fact(2))  \nonumber \\
&amp; = 4 \times (3 \times (2 \times \fact(1)))  \nonumber \\
 &amp;=4 \times (3 \times (2 \times 1 \times (\fact(0))))  \nonumber \\
&amp; = 4 \times (3 \times (2 \times (1 \times 1)))  \nonumber \\
&amp; = 24  \nonumber \\
\end{align}\]  

<p>
Understood in this way, the defining equations (\ref{defnfact}) provide an
<em>algorithm</em> for computing \(\fact(x)\)&mdash;i.e. an effective procedure for calculating its values which can be carried out by a human or mechanical computing device within a finite number of steps. It is for this reason that a class of recursive definitions similar to that exemplified by (\ref{defnfact})&mdash; i.e. the <em>general recursive functions</em>&mdash;were first employed as the mathematical model of computation on which recursive function theory was originally founded.</p>

<p>
Section 1 of this entry provides an overview of the foundational developments in logic and mathematics which led to the founding of recursive function theory in the 1930s.  Section 2 surveys different forms of recursive definitions, inclusive of the <em>primitive</em> and <em>partial recursive functions</em> which are most central to the classical development of this subject.  Section 3 provides an overview of computability theory, inclusive of the so-called <em>Recursion Theorem</em> (Section 3.4)&mdash;a result which highlights the centrality of recursion to computation in general as well as its relationship to self-reference.  Subsequent updates to this entry will provide an overview of subrecursive hierarchies employed in proof theory and computer science as well as a more comprehensive treatment of contemporary computability theory.

<h2 id="HistBack">1. Historical Background</h2>

<p>
NB: This section assumes familiarity with some of the terminology
introduced in
 <a href="#FormRecu">Section 2</a>
 and
 <a href="#CompTheo">Section 3</a>.
 Readers looking for a technical overview of recursive functions or
computability theory are advised to start there.</p>

<h3 id="EarlHistRecuDefi">1.1 The Early History of Recursive Definitions</h3>

<p>
Examples of recursive definitions can be found intermittently in the
history of ancient and medieval mathematics. A familiar illustration
is the sequence \(F_i\) of <em>Fibonacci numbers</em>
\(1,1,2,3,5,8,13, \ldots\) given by the recurrence \(F_0 = 1, F_1 =
1\) and \(F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\) (see
 <a href="#AddiClosPropPrimRecuFunc">Section 2.1.3</a>).
 The definition of this sequence has traditionally been attributed to
the thirteenth century Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa (also
known as Fibonacci) who introduced it in his <em>Liber Abaci</em> in the context of an example involving population genetics (see
Fibonacci 1202 [2003, 404&ndash;405]). But descriptions of
similar sequences can also be found in Greek, Egyptian, and Sanskrit
sources dating as early as 700 BCE (see, e.g., Singh 1985).</p>

<p>
General interest in recursion as a mode of function definition
originated in the mid-nineteenth century as part of the broader
program of arithmetizing analysis and the ensuing discussions of the
foundations of arithmetic itself. In this context, the formulation of
recursive definitions for number theoretic functions was closely tied
to the isolation of mathematical induction as a mode of reasoning
about the natural numbers. It was in this setting in which Grassmann
(1861) and Peirce (1881) first gave the familiar recursive
definitions of addition and
 multiplication:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 </p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{defnadd}
\text{i.}\quad &amp;&amp;  x + 0 &amp; = x \\ \nonumber
\text{ii.}\quad &amp;&amp;  x + (y+1) &amp; = (x+y)+1
\end{align}\]

 

\[\begin{align} \label{defnmult}
\text{i.}\quad &amp;&amp;  x \times 0 &amp; = 0 \\ \nonumber
\text{ii.}\quad &amp;&amp;  x \times (y+1) &amp; = (x\times y) + x
\end{align}\]

<p>
They then used these definition to prove the associative, commutative,
and distributive laws for these
 operations.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
The first person to employ the expression &ldquo;definition by
recursion&rdquo; appears to have been Dedekind in his essay <em>Was
sind und was sollen die Zahlen</em> (1888). This work presents a set
theoretic foundation for arithmetic wherein Dedekind demonstrated that
it was possible to state and prove the existence and uniqueness of
functions defined by primitive recursion as mathematical theorems
(&sect;125&ndash;126). He formulated recursive definitions of addition
(&sect;135), multiplication (&sect;147), and exponentiation
(&sect;155) and then also formally proved by induction that the
functions so defined satisfy the expected algebraic identities. The
first two of these definitions would later be adopted by Peano (1889)
as defining the symbols \(+\) and \(\times\) in the direct
axiomatization of arithmetic he based on Dedekind&rsquo;s
monograph.</p>

<h3 id="OrigPrimRecu">1.2 The Origins of Primitive Recursion</h3>

<p>
The first work devoted exclusively to recursive definability was
Skolem&rsquo;s (1923) paper </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The foundations of elementary arithmetic established by the recursive
mode of thought, without the use of apparent variables ranging over
infinite domains. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This work is significant with respect to the subsequent development of
computability theory for at least three reasons. First, it contains a
informal description of what we now call the <em>primitive recursive
functions</em>. Second, it can be regarded as the first place where recursive definability is linked to effective computability (see also Skolem 1946).  And third, it demonstrates that a wide range of functions and relations are primitive recursive in a manner which anticipates  G&ouml;del&rsquo;s (1931) use of primitive recursion for the arithmetization of syntax.  
</p>

<p>
One of Skolem&rsquo;s stated goals was to present a logical foundation for number theory which avoids the use of unrestricted quantifiers. He was inspired in this regard by the observation that it is possible to develop much of elementary arithmetic without the use of the expressions &ldquo;always&rdquo; (i.e. <em>for all</em>) and &ldquo;sometimes&rdquo;  (i.e. <em>there exists</em>) which figure in the formalization of number theory given by Russell and Whitehead in <em>Principia Mathematica</em> (1910&ndash;1913).  This was to be accomplished by formulating arithmetical theorems as what he referred to as <em>functional assertions</em>.  These took the form of identities between terms defined by primitive recursive operations which Skolem referred to as <em>descriptive functions</em>.  For instance, the commutativity of addition is expressed in this form by an equation with free variables
</p>

\[\begin{equation}\label{funassert}
x + y = y + x
\end{equation}\]

<p>
In cases where such statements are provable in the system Skolem
describes, the intended interpretation is that the claim holds
universally for all natural numbers&mdash;e.g., \(\forall x \forall y
(x + y = y + x)\). But in Skolem&rsquo;s system there is no means
of negating such a statement to express a bare existential assertion
without producing a witness.</p>

<p>
Statements like (\ref{funassert}) would later be referred to by
Hilbert &amp; Bernays (1934) (who provided the first textbook treatment of recursion) as <em>verifiable</em> in the sense that
their individual instances can be verified computationally by
replacing variables with concrete numerals. This is accomplished by
what Skolem referred to as the &ldquo;recursive mode of
thought&rdquo;. The sense of this phrase is clarified by the following properties of the system he describes: </p>

<ol type="i">

<li id="skolemi"> the natural numbers are taken as basic objects
together with the successor function \(x + 1\); </li>

<li id="skolemii"> it is assumed that descriptive functions proven to
be equal may be substituted for one another in other expressions;
</li>

<li id="skolemiii"> all definitions of functions and relations on
natural numbers are given by recursion; </li>

<li id="skolemiv">functional assertions such as (\ref{funassert}) must
be proven by induction. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Taking these principles as a foundation, Skolem showed how to obtain
recursive definitions of the <em>predecessor</em> and <em>subtraction</em> functions,
the <em>less than</em>, <em>divisibility</em>, and <em>primality</em>
relations, <em>greatest common divisors</em>, <em>least common
multiples</em>, and <em>bounded sums and products</em> which are similar to those given in  <a href="#Exam"> Section 2.1.2 </a> below.</p>

<p>
Overall Skolem considered instances of what we
would now refer to as primitive recursion, course of values recursion,
double recursion, and recursion on functions of type \(\mathbb{N}
\rightarrow \mathbb{N}\). He did not, however, introduce general schemas so as to systematically distinguish these modes of definition. Nonetheless,
properties i&ndash;iv of Skolem&rsquo;s treatment provide a means of
assimilating calculations like (\ref{factcalc}) to derivations in
quantifier-free first-order logic.  It is thus not difficult to discern in (Skolem 1923) the kernel of the system we now know as <em>Primitive Recursive
Arithmetic</em> (as later formally introduced by Hilbert &amp; Bernays 1934, ch. 7).</p>

<p>
The next important steps in the development of a general theory of
recursive function arose as a consequence of the interaction between
 <a href="../hilbert-program/index.html">Hilbert&rsquo;s Program</a> and G&ouml;del&rsquo;s
(1931) proof of the Incompleteness Theorems.  Hilbert (1900) had announced the goal of proving the consistency of arithmetic&mdash;and ultimately also analysis and set theory&mdash; in the face of the set theoretic paradoxes.   His initial plans for carrying out such a proof are described in a series of lectures and addresses in the 1910s&ndash;1920s which provide a description of what would come to be called the <em>finitary standpoint</em>&mdash;i.e., the fragment of mathematical reasoning pertaining to finite combinatorial objects which was intended to serve as the secure basis for a consistency proof.   The proof itself was to be carried out using the methods of what Hilbert referred to as <em>metamathematics</em>&mdash;i.e., the formal study of axioms and derivations which would grow into the subject now known as <a href="../proof-theory/index.html"><em>proof theory</em></a>.</p>

<p>
In one of his initial descriptions of this program Hilbert (1905)
sketched the basic form which a metamathematical proof of consistency
might take. Suppose, for instance, that \(\mathsf{T}\) is a
mathematical theory about which it is possible to prove the following
conditional:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>If \(n\) applications of rules of inference applied to the axioms of a system \(\mathsf{T}\) do not lead to a contradiction, then
\(n+1\) applications also do not lead to a contradiction.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Were it possible to provide a mathematical demonstration of i), it
might seem possible to conclude</p>

<ol type="i" start="2">

<li>\(\mathsf{T}\) is consistent.</li>
</ol>

<p>
However Poincar&eacute; (1906) observed that Hilbert&rsquo;s approach
 relies on mathematical induction in inferring ii from i.   He objected on this basis that this renders Hilbert&rsquo;s proposed method circular in the case that the system \(\mathsf{T}\) in question itself subsumes principles intended to formalize induction.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
Together with his collaborators Ackermann and Bernays, Hilbert developed metamathematics considerably during the 1910&ndash;1920s.  This served as the basis of  Hilbert&rsquo;s (1922) lecture wherein he replied to Poincar&eacute; by making a systematic distinction between &ldquo;formal&ldquo; occurrences of mathematical induction in the object language and the metatheoretic use of induction as a &ldquo;contentual&ldquo; [<em>inhaltliche</em>] principle used in order to reason about proofs as finite combinatorial objects.  It was also in this context in which Hilbert connected the latter form of induction to the &ldquo;construction and deconstruction of number signs&rdquo; (1922, 1123). 
</p>

<p>
As is made clear in subsequent presentations, Hilbert understood
&ldquo;number signs&rdquo; to be unary numerals written in stroke
notation of the form </p> 

\[\nonumber
|, ||, |||, \ldots\]

<p>
Such expressions can be operated on concretely by adjoining or
removing strokes in a manner which mirrors the arithmetical operations
of successor and predecessor which figure in Skolem&rsquo;s
&ldquo;recursive mode of thought&ldquo;. This observation in turn informed Hilbert&rsquo;s explanation of the meaning of functional assertions like (\ref{funassert}) in terms of their logical derivability from recursive definitions which also serve as procedures for computing the values of functions they define  (Hilbert 1920, 54&ndash;57).</p>

<p>
Hilbert first described a logical calculus for finitary number theory
including &ldquo;recursion and intuitive induction for finite
totalities&rdquo; in (1923, 1139).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup>
Although this presentation also included a discussion of definition by simultaneous recursion, a more extensive  treatment of what we would now recognize as <em>recursion schemes</em> is given in his well known paper &ldquo;On the infinite&rdquo; (1926).  This includes a discussion of what Hilbert calls <em>ordinary recursion</em> (which is similar to Skolem&rsquo;s description of primitive recursion), transfinite recursion, as well as recursion at higher types.   This treatment makes clear that Hilbert and his collaborators had taken substantial steps towards developing a general theory of recursive definability.  Ultimately, however, the influence of Hilbert&rsquo;s presentations was diminished in light of the more precise formulation of primitive recursion which G&ouml;del would soon provide.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
</p>

<p>
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s (1931, 157&ndash;159) definition was as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A number-theoretic function \(\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) is said to be
<em>recursively defined in terms of</em> the number-theoretic
functions \(\psi(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_{n-1})\) and \(\mu(x_1,x_2,\ldots,
x_{n+1})\) if</p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{gprimrec}
\text{i.}\quad &amp; \phi(0,x_2,\ldots,x_n)  =  \psi(x_2,\ldots,x_n) \\ \nonumber
\text{ii.}\quad &amp; \phi(k+1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)  =  \mu(k,\phi(k,x_2,\ldots,x_n),x_2,\ldots,x_n)
\end{align}\]

<p>
holds for all \(x_2,\ldots,x_n,k\).</p>

<p>
A number-theoretic function \(\phi\) is said to be <em>recursive</em>
if there is a finite sequence of number-theoretic functions \(\phi_1 ,
\phi_2 , \ldots \phi_n\) that ends with \(\phi\) and has the property
that every function \(\phi_k\) of the sequence is recursively defined
in terms of two of the preceding functions, or results from any of the
preceding functions by substitution, or, finally, is a constant or the
successor function \(x + 1\)&hellip;. A relation \(R(x_1, \ldots ,
x_n)\) between natural numbers is said to be <em>recursive</em> if
there is a recursive function \(\phi(x_1 \ldots , x_n)\) such that,
for all \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) </p> 

\[\begin{equation}\label{prch}
R(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \leftrightarrow \phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n) = 0
\end{equation}\]

</blockquote>

<p>
Putting aside G&ouml;del&rsquo;s use of the term &ldquo;recursive&rdquo;
rather than &ldquo;primitive recursive&rdquo; (which will be explained
below), this exposition comes close to coinciding with the
contemporary definition of the primitive recursive functions given in
 <a href="#PrimRecuFuncPR">Section 2.1</a>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
 G&ouml;del&rsquo;s definition also improved upon those of his
predecessors by clearly defining the class of initial functions which
are allowed in primitive recursive definitions and by stating that
each primitive recursive function possesses a definition in terms of a sequence of functions showing how it is built up from initial functions. This makes clear that the primitive recursive functions constitute a mathematically well-defined class of functions on the natural numbers (which will be denoted here as  \(\mathbf{PR}\)).  G&ouml;del additionally proved that the primitive recursive relations&mdash;defined as characteristic
functions via (\ref{prch})&mdash;are closed under propositional
operations and quantification bounded by a primitive recursive
function (see  <a href="#Exam">Section 2.1.2</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="AritReprGodeFirsIncoTheo">1.3 Arithmetical Representability and G&ouml;del&rsquo;s First Incompleteness Theorem</h3>

<p>
The foregoing definition appears in G&ouml;del&rsquo;s well-known
(1931) paper &ldquo;On formally undecidable propositions of
<em>Principia mathematica</em> and related systems I&rdquo;. As he
observes immediately before presenting it, the definition of primitive
recursion is in fact a digression from the main focus of the
paper&mdash;i.e., proving the incompleteness of the axiomatic system of arithmetic he calls \(\mathsf{P}\). In order to understand G&ouml;del&rsquo;s contribution to the initial development of recursive function theory, it will be useful to attend both to some features of this system and also to his proof of the First Incompleteness Theorem itself.  (Additional details and
context are provided in the entry on
 <a href="../goedel-incompleteness/index.html">G&ouml;del&rsquo;s incompleteness theorems</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
System \(\mathsf{P}\) is obtained from that of Whitehead and
Russell&rsquo;s <em>Principia Mathematica</em> (1910&ndash;1913)  by omitting the ramification of types, taking the natural numbers as the lowest type, and adding for them the second-order Peano axioms. It is hence a fixed formal system with finitely many non-logical
axioms sufficient for the development of elementary number
 theory.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
Recall also that an arithmetical system is said to be \(\omega\)-<em>consistent</em> if it does not prove both \(\exists x \varphi(x)\) and \(\neg \varphi(\overline{n})\) for each natural number \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) (where \(\overline{n} =_{\mathrm{df}} s(s(\ldots s(0)))\) \(n\)-times) and that \(\omega\)-consistency implies <em>simple consistency</em> (i.e., the non-derivability of a formula and its negation).
 </p>

<p>
The incompleteness theorem which G&ouml;del proved
states that if \(\mathsf{P}\) is &omega;-consistent, then there exists
a formula \(G_{\mathsf{P}}\) which is <em>undecidable in</em>
\(\mathsf{P}\)&mdash;i.e., neither provable nor refutable from its
axioms. In order to obtain such a formula, G&ouml;del first demonstrated how it is possible to express various syntactic and metatheoretic properties of
\(\mathsf{P}\)-formulas and proofs as primitive recursive relations
via a technique which has come to be known as the <em>arithmetization of syntax</em>
(see the entry on <a href="../goedel-incompleteness/index.html#AriForLan">G&ouml;del&rsquo;s incompleteness theorems</a>).
 Second, he showed that for every primitive recursive relation
\(R(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\) there exists a &ldquo;class sign&rdquo; (i.e.,
formula) \(\varphi_R(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) of \(\mathsf{P}\) such that the
fact that \(R(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) holds of (or does not hold of) a given
tuple of numbers \(n_1,\ldots,n_k\) is mirrored by the provability (or
refutability) in \(\mathsf{P}\) of the corresponding instance of
\(\varphi_R(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) when the formal numeral
\(\overline{n} = s(s(\ldots s(0)))\) (\(n\)-times) is substituted for \(x_i\)&mdash;i.e.,</p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{rep}
\text{i.}\quad &amp; \text{if } R(n_1,\ldots,n_k), \text{ then } \mathsf{P} \vdash \varphi_R(\overline{n}_1,\ldots,\overline{n}_k) \\ \nonumber
\text{ii.}\quad &amp; \text{if } \neg R(n_1,\ldots,n_k), \text{ then } \mathsf{P} \vdash \neg \varphi_R(\overline{n}_1,\ldots,\overline{n}_k)
\end{align}\]

<p>
According to the terminology G&ouml;del would later introduce in (1934), in such a case \(\varphi_R(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) <em>represents</em>
\(R(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\). In this presentation, he also generalized
his prior definition to say that a function \(f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) is
representable in \(\mathsf{P}\) just in case there exists a formula
\(\varphi_f(x_1,\ldots,x_k,y)\) such that for all \(n_1,\ldots,x_k,m
\in \mathbb{N}\), </p> 

\[\begin{equation}\label{repfun}
f(n_1,\ldots,n_k) = m  \textrm{ if and only if } \mathsf{P} \vdash \varphi_f(\overline{n}_1,\ldots,\overline{n}_k,\overline{m})
\end{equation}\]

<p>
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s arithmetization of syntax provides a means of
assigning to each primitive symbol, term, formula, and proof
\(\alpha\) of \(\mathsf{P}\) a unique <em>G&ouml;del number</em>
\(\ulcorner \alpha \urcorner \in \mathbb{N}\) according to its
syntactic structure. This technique takes advantage of the familiar
observation that a finite sequence of numbers \(n_1,\ldots,n_k\) can
be encoded as a product of prime powers \(2^{n_1} \cdot 3^{n_2} \cdot
\ldots p_k^{n_k}\) so that various correlative operations on sequences
can be shown to be primitive recursive&mdash;e.g., the operation which takes
two numbers \(x\) and \(y\) encoding sequences and returns the code \(x * y\) of the result of concatenating \(x\) followed by \(y\). G&ouml;del
proceeded on this basis to show that a sequence of
notions about the syntax and proof theory of \(\mathsf{P}\) are primitive recursive&mdash;e.g., the function
\(\textrm{Neg}(x)\) which returns the G&ouml;del number of the negation of the formula
coded by \(x\) can be defined as \(\ulcorner \neg \urcorner * x\). The
availability of the relevant recursive definitions thus falls out
naturally since the inductive definitions of syntactic notions like
<em>well-formed formula</em> generalize the &ldquo;construction and
deconstruction of number signs&rdquo; in the sense described by
 Hilbert.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
The penultimate definition in G&ouml;del&rsquo;s list is the relation
\(\mathsf{Proof}_{\mathsf{P}}(x,y)\) which holds between the
G&ouml;del number of a \(\mathsf{P}\)-formula \(\varphi\) and the
G&ouml;del number of a finite sequence of \(\mathsf{P}\)-formulas
\(\psi_1,\ldots, \psi_n\) just in case the latter is a correctly
formed derivation of the former from the axioms of
\(\mathsf{P}\)&mdash;i.e.,</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\mathsf{Proof}_{\mathsf{P}}(\ulcorner \psi_1,\ldots, \psi_n
\urcorner, \ulcorner \varphi \urcorner))\) iff \(\mathsf{P} \vdash
\varphi\) via a derivation \(\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_n\) in which each
\(\psi_i\) is either an axiom of \(\mathsf{P}\) or follows from prior
formulas via its rules of inference. </p> <!-- orig 10 -->

<p>
From (\ref{rep}) it follows that there exists a formula
\(\textrm{Proof}_{\mathsf{P}}(x,y)\) of \(\mathsf{P}\) which
represents \(\mathsf{Proof}_{\mathsf{P}}(x,y)\) and thus also a
formula</p> 

\[\textrm{Prov}_{\mathsf{P}}(y) =_{\textrm{df}} \exists x \textrm{Proof}_{\mathsf{P}}(x,y).\]

<p>
G&ouml;del famously named the latter formula \(\sc{BEW}(x)\) (for
<em>beweisbar</em>) as it can be understood to express that there
exists a proof from the axioms of \(\mathsf{P}\) of the formula with
G&ouml;del number \(y\). But unlike the other formulas representing
primitive recursive relations which figure in its definition,
\(\textrm{Prov}_{\mathsf{P}}(x)\) contains an unbounded existential quantifier.
And thus as G&ouml;del is careful to observe, there is no reason to
expect that it defines a primitive recursive relation.</p>

<p>
It is, nonetheless, this formula which G&ouml;del uses to construct a
sentence which is undecidable in \(\mathsf{P}\). This can be
accomplished by the application of the so-called <em>Diagonal Lemma</em>
 (see <a href="../goedel-incompleteness/index.html#DiaSelRef">G&ouml;del&rsquo;s incompleteness theorems</a>)
 which states that for every formula \(\varphi(x)\) of \(\mathsf{P}\),
there exists a sentence \(\psi_{\varphi}\) such that </p> 

\[\mathsf{P} \vdash \psi_{\varphi} \leftrightarrow \varphi(\overline{\ulcorner \psi_{\varphi} \urcorner})\]

<p>
When applied to the formula \(\neg \textrm{Prov}_{\mathsf{P}}(x)\),
the Diagonal Lemma yields a sentence \(G_{\mathsf{P}}\)&mdash;i.e.,
the so-called <em>G&ouml;del sentence for
\(\mathsf{P}\)</em>&mdash;such that \(\mathsf{P} \vdash G_P
\leftrightarrow \neg \textrm{Prov}_{\mathsf{P}}(\ulcorner
G_{\mathsf{P}} \urcorner)\). \(G_{\mathsf{P}}\) is thus interpretable as &ldquo;saying of itself&rdquo; that it is unprovable in \(\mathsf{P}\).  G&ouml;del showed that this formula has the following properties: </p>

<ol type="i">

<li>if \(\mathsf{P}\) is consistent, then \(\mathsf{P} \not\vdash
G_{\mathsf{P}}\); </li>

<li> if \(\mathsf{P}\) is &omega;-consistent,
 then \(\mathsf{P} \not\vdash \neg G_{\mathsf{P}}\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
This constitutes what is now known as G&ouml;del&rsquo;s First
Incompleteness Theorem.</p>

<p>
The proof of this fact relies explicitly on the
representability of the relation \(\mathsf{Proof}_{\mathsf{P}}(x,y)\)
in \(\mathsf{P}\) which in turn derives from its primitive
recursiveness. But the techniques on which G&ouml;del&rsquo;s proof relies
also contributed to the subsequent development of computability theory in
several additional ways. First, it follows from the possibility of
G&ouml;del numbering the formulas of \(\mathsf{P}\) that we may also
effectively enumerate them as \(\varphi_0(x), \varphi_1(x),
\varphi_2(x), \ldots\)&mdash;e.g., in increasing order of \(\ulcorner
\varphi_i \urcorner\). This provides a mechanism for referring to
formulas via their indices which in turn served as an important
precedent for Kleene&rsquo;s (1936a) use of a similar indexation of
general recursive definitions in his proof of the Normal Form Theorem
(see
 <a href="#NormFormTheo">Section 2.2.2</a>).
 Second, the proof of the Diagonal Lemma also demonstrates how it is
possible to formalize the substitution of terms for free variables in
a manner which may be understood to yield an effective form of
Cantor&rsquo;s diagonal argument
 (see the entry on <a href="../self-reference/index.html">self-reference</a>).
 This technique served as an important precedent for the use of
diagonalization in results such as the undecidability of the Halting
Problem (Turing 1937, see
 <a href="#NonCompFuncUndeProb">Section 3.2</a>),
 the Recursion Theorem (Kleene 1938, see
 <a href="#RecuTheo">Section 3.4</a>),
 and the Hierarchy Theorem (Kleene 1943, see
 <a href="#AritAnalHier">Section 3.6</a>).
</p>

<p>
Another significant contribution of G&ouml;del&rsquo;s paper derives
from the fact that after proving the incompleteness of \(\mathsf{P}\),
he took several steps towards isolating features of axiomatic theories which are sufficient 
to ensure that they satisfy analogous undecidability results. In addition to being sufficiently strong to
satisfy (\ref{rep}), the other requirement which he identifies is that
&ldquo;the class of axioms and the rules of inference \(\ldots\) are
recursively definable&rdquo; (1931, 181). As he notes, these features
hold both of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory \([\mathsf{ZF}\)] and a
first-order arithmetical system similar to what we now call
first-order Peano arithmetic \([\mathsf{PA]}\), relative to an
appropriate G&ouml;del numbering of their axioms. In particular, while
neither of these systems is <em>finitely axiomatizable</em>, they may
be axiomatized by a finite number of schemes (e.g., of induction or
comprehension) such that the relation <em>\(\ulcorner \varphi
\urcorner\) is the G&ouml;del number of an axiom of <span class="sans-serif">T</span></em>
is primitive recursive.</p>

<p>
This observation set the stage for G&ouml;del&rsquo;s subsequent
revisiting of the incompleteness theorems in the lectures (1934)
wherein he suggests a significant generalization of his original
(1931) definition of recursiveness. G&ouml;del starts out by providing
the following informal characterization of the requirements of the
theories just described:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We require that the rules of inference, and the definitions of
meaningful formulas and axioms, be constructive; that is, for each
rule of inference there shall be a finite procedure for determining
whether a given formula \(B\) is an immediate consequence (by that
rule) of given formulas \(A_1, \ldots, A_n\) and there shall be a
finite procedure for determining whether a given formula \(A\) is a
meaningful formula or an axiom. (G&ouml;del 1934, 346)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He also makes clear that what he calls &ldquo;recursiveness&rdquo; is
to be initially regarded as an <em>informal</em> notion which he is
attempting to make precise:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Recursive functions have the important property that, for each given
set of values of the arguments, the value of the function can be
computed by a finite procedure. Similarly, recursive relations
(classes) are decidable in the sense that, for each given
\(n\)-tuple of natural numbers, it can be determined by a finite
procedure whether the relation holds or does not hold (the number
belongs to the class or not), since the representing function is
computable. (G&ouml;del 1934, 348)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One of G&ouml;del&rsquo;s goals was thus to provide a mathematical
definition of the term &ldquo;recursive&rdquo; which generalizes prior
examples of recursive definability in a manner but also captures to as great an extent as possible the class of functions computable by a finite procedure. This led him to define the so-called <em>general recursive functions</em>
(see
 <a href="#GeneRecuFunc">Section 1.5</a>)
 whose isolation in turn played an important role in the formulation
of <em>Church&rsquo;s Thesis</em> (see
 <a href="#ChurThes">Section 1.6</a>).
 However G&ouml;del&rsquo;s definition also took place against the
backdrop of other work which had been inspired by Hilbert&rsquo;s
original consideration of different forms of recursive definitions. It
will now be useful to examine these developments.</p>

<h3 id="AckePeteFunc">1.4 The Ackermann-P&eacute;ter Function</h3>

<p>
Already at the time of (1926), Hilbert had anticipated that it would be
possible to formulate definitions of functions whose values could be
computed in a recursive manner but which are not themselves primitive
recursive. In order to illustrate how such a definition might be
obtained, he presented a heuristic argument involving the following
sequence of functions:</p> 

\[\begin{align}
\nonumber \alpha_0(x,y) &amp;= x + 1 &amp;\text{(successor)} \\ 
\nonumber \alpha_1(x,y) &amp;= x + y &amp;\text{(addition)} \\ 
\nonumber \alpha_2(x,y) &amp;= x \times y &amp;\text{(multiplication)} \\ 
\nonumber \alpha_3(x,y) &amp;= x^y &amp;\text{(exponentiation)} \\ 
\nonumber \alpha_4(x,y) &amp;= \underbrace{x^{x^{\udots^x}}}_{y \textrm{ times}} &amp;\text{(super-exponentiation)} \\ 
\nonumber  &amp;\vdots
\end{align}\]

<p>
The functions in this sequence are defined so that
\(\alpha_{i+1}(x,y+1)\) is obtained by primitive recursion as
\(\alpha_i(\alpha_{i+1}(x,y),x)\), together with an appropriate base
case. It thus makes sense mathematically to consider the function </p>

\[\begin{equation}\label{alphadef}
\alpha(i,x,y) = \alpha_i(x,y)
\end{equation}\]

<p>
wherein the first argument \(i\) represents the position of the
function \(\alpha_i(x,y)\) in the prior list. For fixed \(i,n,m \in
\mathbb{N}\) it is thus possible to effectively compute the value of
\(\alpha(i,n,m)\) by first constructing the definition of
\(\alpha_i(x,y)\) and then evaluating it at \(n,m\). But it is
also easy to see that \(\alpha_{i+1}(x,x)\) will eventually dominate
\(\alpha_i(x,x)\) for sufficiently large \(x\). This in turn suggests
that \(\alpha(i,x,y)\) cannot be defined by a finite number of
applications of the primitive recursion scheme and is thus not itself
primitive recursive.</p>

<p>
The specification of \(\alpha(i,x,y)\) just given does not itself have
the form of a recursive definition. But it is possible to define
similar functions in a manner which generalizes the format of the
scheme (\ref{gprimrec}). One means of doing so is to first use
recursion on the type \(\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\)&mdash;a
simple form of recursion at higher types as envisioned by Skolem and 
Hilbert&mdash;to define an <em>iteration functional</em> as follows:
</p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{Iter}(\phi,0) &amp;= \phi \\ \nonumber
\mathcal{Iter}(\phi,x+1) &amp;= \phi(\mathcal{Iter}(\phi,x)) \end{aligned}\]

<p>
\(\mathcal{Iter}\) takes as arguments a function \(\phi:\mathbb{N}
\rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) as well as a number \(x \in \mathbb{N}\) and
is defined so that \(\mathcal{Iter}(\phi,n) =
\phi^{n+1}(x)\)&mdash;i.e., the function which is the \(n\)th
iterate of \(\phi\). We may now define a function \(\beta\) of type
\(\mathbb{N} \rightarrow (\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N})\) as
follows: </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\beta(0) &amp;= x+1 \textrm{ (i.e., the successor function)} \\ 
\beta(x+1) &amp;= \mathcal{Iter}(\beta,x) \nonumber\end{aligned}\]

<p>
It can then be verified that </p> 

\[\begin{align*}
\beta(0) &amp; = x +1, \\
\beta(1) &amp; = 2 + (x + 3) - 3 = x+2, \\
\beta(2) &amp; = 2 \times x - 3, \\
\beta(3) &amp; = 2^{x+3} - 3, \\
\beta(4) &amp;= \underbrace{2^{2^{\udots^2}}}_{x \textrm{ times}} - 3,\\ 
  &amp;\vdots
\end{align*}
\]

<p>
On this basis, we may now define a variant of the so-called
<em>Ackermann-P&eacute;ter function</em> as \(\pi(i,x) =
\beta(i)(x)\)&mdash;i.e., the result of applying the function
\(\beta(i)\) to the argument \(x\). \(\pi(i,x)\) has the same order of
growth as \(\alpha_i(x,x)\) and it is possible to prove via the
argument sketched above that \(\pi(i,x)\) is not primitive recursive
(see, e.g., P&eacute;ter 1967, ch. 9). Based on earlier work of Ackermann
(1928), P&eacute;ter (1935) also showed that \(\pi(i,x)\) may also be
defined by a so-called <em>doubly recursive</em> definition of the
following form which takes only natural numbers as
 arguments:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
 </p> 

\[\begin{align}
\label{pidef}
\pi(0,x) &amp;= x + 1\\ \nonumber
\pi(i+1,0) &amp;= \pi(i,1)\\ \nonumber
\pi(i+1,x+1) &amp;= \pi(i,\pi(i+1,x)) 
\end{align}\]

<p>
The third clause in this definition defines the value of \(\pi(i,x)\)
in terms of the value \(\pi(i,x-1)\) rather than \(\pi(i-1,x-1)\) in
analogy with the scheme (\ref{gprimrec}). It may thus not be
immediately obvious that the definition (\ref{pidef}) describes an
algorithm for computing the values of \(\pi(i,x)\) which always
terminates in the manner illustrated by the calculation
(\ref{factcalc}). Note, however, with each recursive application
either \(i\) decreases, or \(i\) remains the same and \(x\)
decreases. It thus follows that each time \(x\) reaches 0, \(i\)
will start to decrease so that the base case is eventually reached.
Thus although the value of \(\pi(i,x)\) grows very rapidly&mdash;e.g.,
\(\pi(4,3) = 2^{2^{65536}}-3\)&mdash;it is still reasonable to regard
<span class="nobr">(\ref{pidef})</span> as satisfying
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s requirement that a recursively defined function is
computable by a finite procedure.</p>

<p>
Systematic consideration of such alternative recursion schemes
exemplified by (\ref{pidef}) was initiated by P&eacute;ter (1932). It
was also she who introduced the term &ldquo;primitive recursive&rdquo;
to describe the class of functions given by G&ouml;del&rsquo;s scheme
(\ref{gprimrec}), a choice which would become standard after its
adoption by Kleene (1936a). P&eacute;ter additionally showed that
Hilbert&rsquo;s (1926) formulation of &ldquo;ordinary recursion&rdquo;
is equivalent to primitive recursion, and that the primitive recursive
functions are closed under course of values recursion, as well as
so-called <em>nested recursions</em> of one variable. Such studies led
to her book (P&eacute;ter 1967), whose original German edition
<em>Rekursive Funktionen</em> (1951) was the first monograph devoted
to recursive functions. Together with the later work of Grzegorczyk
(1953), these developments also inspired the investigation of various
subrecursive hierarchies which would later play a role in proof theory
and computer science.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<h3 id="GeneRecuFunc">1.5 The General Recursive Functions</h3>

<p>
The immediate source for G&ouml;del&rsquo;s discussion of recursion in 1934 was not Ackermann or P&eacute;ter&rsquo;s work but rather a private communication with Herbrand, who in two previous papers (1930, 1932) had proposed a related means of generalizing recursive definitions.
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s informal description of Herbrand&rsquo;s suggestion
was as follows:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup></p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If \(\phi\) denotes an unknown function, and \(\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_k\)
are known functions, and if the \(\psi\)&rsquo;s and \(\phi\) are
substituted in one another in the most general fashions and certain
pairs of the resulting expressions are equated, then, if the resulting
set of functional equations has one and only one solution for
\(\phi\), \(\phi\) is a recursive function. (G&ouml;del 1934, 308)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As an illustration, consider the following set of equations: </p>

\[\begin{align} \label{genrecex}
\phi(0) &amp;= 0 \\ \nonumber
\psi(x) &amp;= \phi(x) + 1\\ \nonumber
\phi(x+1) &amp;= \psi(x) + 1
\end{align}\]

<p>
In this case, the &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; function denoted by
\(\phi(x)\) is specified in terms of the auxiliary function
\(\psi(x)\) in such a way that \(\phi(x)\) appears only once on the
lefthand side of the equations (other than the base case).
Nonetheless, such a system of equations is unlike a primitive
recursive definition in that it does not specify a unique means for
computing the values of \(\phi(n)\) by &ldquo;deconstructing&rdquo;
\(n\) in the deterministic manner illustrated by calculations such
as (\ref{factcalc}).</p>

<p>
In the general case there is indeed no guarantee that there will exist
a unique extensional function satisfying such a definition. But in
the case of this example it can be shown that \(2 \times x\) is the unique
function of type \(\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) satisfying
\(\phi(x)\) in the system of equations (\ref{genrecex}). This may be
illustrated by considering the following calculation of
\(\phi(2)\):</p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{genreccal}
\text{i.}\quad   &amp; \phi(2) = \psi(1) + 1 \\ \nonumber
\text{ii.}\quad  &amp; \psi(1) = \phi(1) +1 \\ \nonumber
\text{iii.}\quad &amp; \phi(1) = \psi(0) + 1 \\ \nonumber
\text{iv.}\quad  &amp; \psi(0) = \phi(0) + 1 \\ \nonumber
\text{v.}\quad   &amp; \phi(0) = 0 \\ \nonumber
\text{vi.}\quad  &amp; \psi(0) = 0 + 1 \\ \nonumber
\text{vii.}\quad &amp; \phi(1) = (0 + 1) + 1 \\ \nonumber
\text{viii.}\quad&amp; \psi(1) = ((0 + 1) + 1) + 1 \\ \nonumber
\text{ix.}\quad  &amp; \phi(2) = (((0 + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1 \ (= 4)
\end{align}\]

<p>
As G&ouml;del notes, such a calculation may be understood as a
derivation in quantifier-free first-order logic wherein the only rules
which are allowed are the substitution of numerals for variables and
the replacement of a term on the righthand side of an equation by a
numeral for which the corresponding identity has already been
derived.</p>

<p>
G&ouml;del introduced the term <em>general recursive</em> to describe
a function defined in this manner. Following the modernized
presentation of Odifreddi (1989, ch. I.2) this class may be specified on
the basis of the following initial
 definitions:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 1.1</strong></p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
The class of <em>numerals</em> is the smallest set containing 0 and
closed under the successor function \(x \mapsto s(x)\). We write
\(\overline{n}\) for the numeral \(s(s(\ldots s(0)))\)
\(n\)-times.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The class of <em>terms</em> is the smallest set containing the
numerals, <em>variables</em> \(x_0,x_1, \ldots\) and closed under the
operations \(t \mapsto s(t)\) and \(t_1,\ldots,t_n \mapsto
\psi^n_i(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) where \(t,t_1,\ldots,t_n\) are terms and
\(\psi^n_i\) is a primitive \(n\)-ary functional symbol.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If \(t\) and \(u\) are terms and \(t\) is of the form
\(\psi^n_i(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) where \(t_1,\ldots,t_n\) do not contain
any functional symbols other than \(s\), then \(t = u\) is an
<em>equation</em>.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
A <em>system of equations</em> is a finite set of equations.
\(\mathcal{E}(\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_n,\vec{x})\) will be used to denote a
system of equations containing primitive functional symbols
\(\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_n\) and variables among \(\vec{x} = x_1,\ldots,
x_k\).</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Herbrand (1932) gave a semantic characterization of what it means for
a number theoretic function \(f\) to be defined by a system of
equations \(\mathcal{E}(\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_n,\vec{x})\) by requiring
both that there is a solution to the system and that \(f\) coincides
with the function determined as \(\psi_1\) for every solution. He also
suggested that this fact should be proved intuitionistically, which
might in turn be thought to yield an effective procedure for computing
the values of
 \(f\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 He did not, however, specify a formal system in which such a proof
should be carried out. And thus G&ouml;del suggested (essentially) the
following syntactic replacement for Herbrand&rsquo;s definition:</p>

<div class="indent" id="grdef">

<p>
<strong>Definition 1.2:</strong> A function \(f:\mathbb{N}^k
\rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) is <em>general recursive</em> if there is a
system of equations \(\mathcal{E}(\psi_1,\ldots,\psi_n,\vec{x})\) such
that if \(\psi^k_i\) is the leftmost functional symbol in the last
equation of \(\mathcal{E}\) then for all \(n_1,\ldots,n_k, m \in
\mathbb{N}\)</p> 

\[f(n_1,\ldots,n_k) = m\]

<p>
if and only if the equation</p> 

\[\psi^k_i(\overline{n}_1,\ldots,\overline{n}_k) = \overline {m}\]

<p>
is derivable from the equations comprising \(\mathcal{E}\) via the
following two rules:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>R1:</dt>
<dd>Substitution of a numeral for every occurrence of a particular
variable in an equation.</dd>
<dt>R2:</dt>
<dd>If \(\psi^j_l(\overline{n}_1,\ldots,\overline{n}_j) = \overline{q}\) has already been derived, then  \(\psi^j_l(\overline{n}_1,\ldots,\overline{n}_j)\) may be replaced with the numeral \(\overline{q}\) on the righthand side of an equation.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In such a case we say that \(\mathcal{E}\) <em>defines</em> \(f\) with
respect to \(\psi^k_i\). </p>
</div>

<p>
It can be verified that the system of equations (\ref{genrecex}) and
the derivation (\ref{genreccal}) exhibited above satisfy the foregoing
requirements, thus illustrating how it is possible to mechanically calculate using a system of general recursive equations.  However certain systems&mdash;e.g., \(\{\phi(x) = 0, \phi(x) =
s(0)\}\)&mdash;are inconsistent in the sense of not being satisfied by
any function on the natural numbers, while
others&mdash;e.g., \(\{\phi(x) = \phi(x)\}\)&mdash;are not satisfied
uniquely. One evident drawback of G&ouml;del&rsquo;s definition of
general recursiveness is thus that there is no apparent means of
establishing whether a given system of equations \(\mathcal{E}\)
determines a unique function (even if only partially defined).   This is one of the reasons why G&ouml;del&rsquo;s characterization has been replaced by other extensionally equivalent definitions such as Kleene&rsquo;s partial recursive functions  (see
 <a href="#PartRecuFuncPartRecuFuncREC">Section 2.2</a>)
 in the subsequent development of computability theory.</p>

<h3 id="ChurThes">1.6 Church&rsquo;s Thesis</h3>

<p>
By formalizing his informal characterization of recursiveness via
 <a href="#grdef">Definition 1.2</a>,
 G&ouml;del succeeded in formulating a definition which subsumes the
primitive recursion scheme (\ref{gprimrec}), the definition of the
Ackermann-P&eacute;ter function, as well as several other schemes
considered by Hilbert. G&ouml;del&rsquo;s definition of general
recursiveness thus also defined a class \(\mathbf{GR}\) of functions of type
\(\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) which properly subsumes the primitive recursive functions  \(\mathbf{PR}\).  Moreover, we now know that the class of functions representable in \(\mathsf{P}\) (and in fact in far weaker arithmetical
systems) corresponds not to the primitive recursive functions, but
rather to the general recursive functions. Weakening the hypothesis
that the set of (G&ouml;del numbers) of the axioms of a formal system
to the requirement that they be general recursive rather than
primitive recursive thus indeed provides a generalization of the First
Incompleteness Theorem the manner in which G&ouml;del envisioned.</p>

<p>
The definition of \(\mathbf{GR}\) is also of historical importance because
it was the first among several equivalent (and nearly
contemporaneous) definitions of what were originally called the
<em>recursive functions</em> but are now often referred to as the
<em>computable functions</em> (see
 <a href="#PartRecuFuncPartRecuFuncREC">Section 2.2</a>).
 These developments also contributed to one of the two final chapters in the study of recursive definability prior to the initiation of computability theory
as an independent subject&mdash;i.e., the isolation and eventual
adoption of what is now known as <em>Church&rsquo;s Thesis</em>.</p>

<p>
Church&rsquo;s Thesis corresponds to the claim that the class of
functions which are computable by a finite mechanical
procedure&mdash;or, as it is traditionally said, are <em>effectively
computable</em>&mdash;coincides with the class of general recursive
functions&mdash;i.e.,</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(CT)</dt>
<dd class="center">\(f:\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) is effectively
computable if and only if \(f \in \mathbf{GR}\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
It may appear that G&ouml;del already proposed a version of
Church&rsquo;s Thesis in 1934. However, he did not immediately endorse
it upon its first explicit articulation by
 Church.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
 And since the surrounding history is complex it will be useful to
record the following observations as a prelude to
 <a href="#FormRecu">Sections 2 and 3</a>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>
 (See also the entries on
 <a href="../church-turing/index.html">Church&rsquo;s Thesis</a>
 and
 <a href="../computational-complexity/index.html#OriComThe">computational complexity theory</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
G&ouml;del delivered the lectures (G&ouml;del 1934) while he was
visiting Princeton in the spring of 1934. Already at that time Church,
together with his students Kleene and Rosser, had made substantial
progress in developing the formal system of function application and
abstraction now known as the <em>untyped lambda calculus</em>. This
system also provides a means of representing natural numbers as formal
terms&mdash;i.e., as so-called <em>Church numerals</em>. This leads to
a notion of a function being <em>lambda-definable</em> 
which is similar in form to (\ref{repfun}). Church&rsquo;s definition
thus also characterize a class \(\mathbf{L}\) of lambda-definable
functions which is similar in form to that of \(\mathbf{GR}\). During this
period, Kleene demonstrated that a wide range of number theoretic
functions were included in \(\mathbf{L}\), in part by showing how it is possible to   implement primitive recursion in the lambda calculus. This ultimately led Church to propose in early 1934 that the lambda-definable functions coincide
with those possessing the property which he called &ldquo;effective
 calculability&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-16" id="ref-16">16</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
A natural conjecture was thus that lambda-definability coincided
extensionally with general recursiveness. Unlike (CT)&mdash;which
equates an informally characterized class of functions with one possessing a precise mathematical definition&mdash;the statement \(\mathbf{GR} =
\mathbf{L}\) potentially admits to formal demonstration. Such a demonstration
was given by Church (1936b; and in greater detail by Kleene 1936b)
providing the first of several extensional equivalence results which
Kleene (1952, sec. 62) would eventually cite as evidence of what he
proposed to call &ldquo;Church&rsquo;s Thesis&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Church&rsquo;s Thesis underlies contemporary computability theory in
the sense that it justifies the assumption that by studying computability relative to a <em>single</em> formalism (such as \(\mathbf{GR}\)  or \(\mathbf{L}\)) we are thereby providing a <em>general</em> account of which functions can and
cannot be effectively computed in principle by an algorithm. In light of this, it will
be useful to catalog some additional evidence for Church&rsquo;s
Thesis in the form of the equivalence of \(\mathbf{GR}\)  with several other
computational formalisms presented in the Stanford Encyclopedia:</p>

<ol type="i" id="equiv">

<li>

<p>
Let \(\mathsf{T}\) be a consistent, computably axiomatizable theory
extending \(\mathsf{Q}\) (i.e., Robinson arithmetic). Then the class
of functions \(\mathbf{F}_{\mathsf{T}}\) which is representable in
\(\mathsf{T}\) in the sense of (\ref{repfun}) above (with
\(\mathsf{T}\) replacing \(\mathsf{P}\)) is such that
\(\mathbf{F}_{\mathsf{T}} = \mathbf{GR}\). (See
 <a href="../goedel-incompleteness/index.html#Rep">representability in the entry on G&ouml;del&rsquo;s incompleteness theorems</a>
 and Odifreddi (1989, ch. I.3).)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The class \(\mathbf{REC}\)  consisting of the total functions which are
members of the class of <em>partial recursive functions</em> (formed
by closing the class \(\mathbf{PR}\)  under the unbounded minimization
operation) is such that \(\mathbf{REC} = \mathbf{GR}\). (See
 <a href="#Defi_1">Section 2.2.1</a>
 and Odifreddi (1989, ch. I.2).)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The class \(\mathbf{CL}\) of functions representable in
 <a href="../logic-combinatory/index.html"><em>Combinatory Logic</em></a>
 (a formal system related to the lambda calculus) is such that
\(\mathbf{CL} = \mathbf{GR}\). (See
 <a href="../logic-combinatory/index.html#CompFuncArit">computable functions and arithmetic in the entry on combinatory logic</a>
 and Bimb&oacute; (2012, ch. 5.3).)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The class \(\mathbf{T}\) of functions computable by a
 <a href="../turing-machine/index.html"><em>Turing machine</em></a>
 (under several variants of its definition) is such that \(\mathbf{T}
= \mathbf{GR}\). (See
 <a href="../turing-machine/index.html#AlteHistModeComp">alternative historical models of computability in the entry on Turing machines</a>
 and Odifreddi (1989, ch. I.4).)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The class \(\mathbf{U}\) of functions computable by <em>Unlimited
Register Machines</em> introduced by Shepherdson &amp; Sturgis (1963)
is such that \(\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{GR}\). (See Cutland (1980, ch.
1&ndash;3) and Cooper (2004, ch. 2).)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Equivalence results of these forms testify to the mathematical
robustness of the class \(\mathbf{GR}\) and thereby also to that of the informal notion of effective computability itself. As we have seen, G&ouml;del was
originally led to the formulation of general recursiveness by
attempting to analyze the background notion of recursive definition as
a model of effective computation as inspired by the foundational
developments of the late nineteenth and early twentieth
 centuries.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup>
 Further discussion of how the work of Church, Turing, and Post can be
seen as providing independently motivated analyses of computability
which also support Church&rsquo;s Thesis can be found in Gandy (1980)
and Sieg (1994, 1997, 2009).</p>

<h3 id="EntsUnde">1.7 The <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> and Undecidability</h3>

<p>
In addition to the goal of widening the scope of
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s Incompleteness Theorems, another motivation for
work on recursive functions during the 1930s was the study of
so-called <em>undecidable</em> (or <em>unsolvable</em>)
<em>problems</em>. The original example of such a problem was that of
determining whether a given formula \(\varphi\) of first-order logic
is <em>valid</em>&mdash;i.e., true in all of its models. This was
first described as the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> (or
<em>decision problem</em>) for first-order logic by Hilbert &amp;
Ackermann in their textbook <em>Grundz&uuml;ge der theoretischen Logik</em> (1928):<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-18" id="ref-18">18</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> is solved if one knows a procedure,
which permits the decision of the universality [i.e., validity] or
satisfiability of a given logical expression by finitely many
operations. The solution of the problem of decision is of fundamental
importance to the theory of all domains whose propositions can be
logically described using finitely many axioms. (Hilbert &amp;
Ackermann 1928,
 73)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This passage illustrates another sense in which the question of the
decidability of logical derivability is connected to the concerns
which had initiated Hilbert&rsquo;s study of metamathematics. For note
that if \(\Gamma\) is a <em>finite</em> set of axioms
\(\{\gamma_1,\ldots,\gamma_k\}\), then the question of whether
\(\psi\) is a logical consequence of \(\Gamma\) is equivalent to
whether the sentence \(\varphi=_{\textrm{df}} (\gamma_1 \wedge \ldots
\wedge \gamma_k) \rightarrow \psi\) is logically valid. By
 <a href="../goedel/index.html#ComThe">G&ouml;del&rsquo;s Completeness Theorem (see the entry on G&ouml;del)</a>
 for first-order logic, this is equivalent to the derivability of
\(\varphi\) from Hilbert &amp; Ackermann&rsquo;s axiomatization
of first-order logic. A positive answer to the
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> could thus be interpreted as showing
that it is possible to mechanize the search for proofs in mathematics
in the sense of allowing us to algorithmically determine if a formula expressing an open question (e.g. the Riemann Hypothesis) is a logical consequence of a suitably powerful finitely axiomatized theory (e.g.,
G&ouml;del-Bernays set theory).</p>

<p>
In addition to analyzing the notion of effective computability itself,
the mathematical goal of both Turing (1937) and Church (1936a,b) was
to provide a mathematically precise <em>negative</em> answer to the
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>. The answers which they provided can be
understood as proceeding in three phases: </p>

<ol type="1">

<li> Via the method of the <em>arithmetization of syntax</em>
described in
 <a href="#AritReprGodeFirsIncoTheo">Section 1.3</a>
 Turing and Church showed how the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> could
be associated with a set of natural numbers \(V\). </li>

<li> They then showed mathematically that \(V\) is not
<em>decidable</em>&mdash;i.e., its characteristic function is not
computable in the formal sense, respectively relative to the models
\(\mathbf{T}\) or \(\mathbf{L}\). </li>

<li> They finally offered further arguments to the effect that these models subsume all effective computable functions thus suggesting the function is not computable in the informal sense either.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first of these steps can be undertaken by defining </p>

\[\begin{aligned}
V &amp; = \{\ulcorner \varphi \urcorner : \varphi \text{ is logically valid} \} \\
&amp; =  \{\ulcorner \varphi \urcorner :  \mathfrak{M} \models \varphi \text{ for all } \mathcal{L}_{\varphi} \text{-models } \mathfrak{M}\} \end{aligned}\]

<p>
where \(\ulcorner \cdot \urcorner\) is a G&ouml;del numbering of the
language of \(\varphi\) as described in
 <a href="#AritReprGodeFirsIncoTheo">Section 1.3</a>.
 The second step of Turing and Church&rsquo;s negative answer to the
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> relied on their prior specification of
similar decision problems for the models \(\mathbf{T}\),
\(\mathbf{L}\), and \(\mathbf{GR}\). Together with Kleene (1936a), they
showed the following:</p>

<div class="indent" id="hpundec0">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 1.1:</strong> The characteristic functions of the
following sets are not computable with respect to the relevant model:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
\(\HP_T = \{\langle i,n \rangle : \text{the Turing machine $T_i$ halts
on input $n$}\}\)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\HP_L = \{\ulcorner M \urcorner : \text{the untyped $\lambda$-term
$M$ has a normal form}\}\)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\HP_{\textit{GR}} = \{\ulcorner \mathcal{E} \urcorner :\) the system
of equations \(\mathcal{E}\)-term determines a general recursive
function\(\}\)</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
For instance, Part i of
 <a href="#hpundec0">Proposition 1.1</a>
 shows that there is no Turing machine which outputs 1 if \(T_i\)
halts on \(n\) and 0 otherwise. This is thus a formulation of
Turing&rsquo;s well-known
 <a href="../turing-machine/index.html#HaltProbEnts"><em>unsolvability of the Halting Problem</em> (see the entry on Turing machines)</a>.
 Part ii and iii would also now be described as expressing that the
sets \(\HP_T,\) \(\HP_L,\) and \(\HP_{\textit{GR}}\) are all
<em>undecidable</em>. By taking into account the equivalence results
summarized in
 <a href="#ChurThes">Section 1.6</a>,
 <a href="#hpundec0">Proposition 1.1</a> thus shows that membership in these sets cannot be
decided relative to <em>any</em> of the models in question.</p>

<p>
On this basis, Turing (for \(\mathbf{T}\)) and Church (for
\(\mathbf{L}\) and \(\mathbf{GR}\)) then proved the following:</p>

<div class="indent" id="churchsthm">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 1.2:</strong> If \(V\) were decidable (with
respect to any of the models in question), then \(\HP_T, \HP_L\), and
\(\HP_{GR}\) would be as well.</p>
</div>

<p>
The proofs which Turing and Church gave of these facts are
constructive in the sense that they show how to effectively transform
an individual instance of one of the models into a first-order formula
such that the formula is valid if and only if the instance possesses
the property in question&mdash;e.g., given a Turing machine \(T_i\)
and input \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), we construct a formula
\(\varphi_{i,n}\) such that the computation \(T_i(n)\) halts if and
only if \(\varphi_{i,n}\) is valid. This method thus anticipates the
definition of  <em>many-one reducibility</em> given in
 <a href="#ManyOneDegr">Section 3.5.1</a>
 below.</p>

<p>
In conjunction with the other arguments which Church and Turing had
already offered in favor of Church&rsquo;s Thesis (see
 <a href="#ChurThes">Section 1.6</a>),
 Propositions
 <a href="#hpundec0">1.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#churchsthm">1.2</a>
 can thus be taken to show that the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> is
indeed not decidable in the informal sense described by Hilbert &amp;
Ackermann (1928)&mdash;i.e., not decidable by a &ldquo;mechanical
procedure using finitely many operations&rdquo;. As we will see in
 <a href="#CompTheo">Section 3</a>, the desire to develop a general theory of such undecidability results and the relations which they bear to one another was an important motivation for the further development of computability theory starting in the 1940s.</p>

<h3 id="OrigRecuFuncTheoCompTheo">1.8 The Origins of Recursive Function Theory and Computability Theory</h3>

<p>
The developments just described form part of the prehistory of the
subfield of  contemporary mathematical logic which was originally known as
<em>recursive function theory</em> (or more simply as <em>recursion
theory</em>). This subject was initiated in earnest by Kleene, Turing,
and Post starting in the late 1930s, directly on the basis of the
papers containing the equivalence and undecidability results
summarized in
 <a href="#ChurThes">Section 1.6</a>
 and
 <a href="#EntsUnde">Section 1.7</a>.
 Of particular importance are the papers (1936a, 1938, 1943,
1955a,b,c) of Kleene. These respectively contain the definition of the
partial recursive functions, the proof of their equivalence to
\(\mathbf{GR}\), the Normal Form Theorem, the Recursion Theorem, and the
definitions of the arithmetical and analytical hierarchies. Of equal
importance are the papers (1937, 1939) of Turing (which
respectively contain the undecidability of the Halting Problem and the
definition of Turing reducibility) and the paper (1944) of
Post (which introduced many-one and one-one reducibility and formulated what would come to be
known as <em>Post&rsquo;s Problem</em>).</p>

<p>
These developments will be surveyed in
 <a href="#CompTheo">Section 3</a>.
 As we will see there, an important theme in the early stages of
computability theory was the characterization of a notion of effective
computability which is capable of supporting rigorous proofs grounded
in intuitions about algorithmic calculability but which abstracts away
from the details of the models mentioned in
 <a href="#ChurThes">Section 1.6</a>.
 To this end, G&ouml;del&rsquo;s original definition of the general
recursive equations was replaced in early textbook treatments (e.g.,
Shoenfield 1967, Rogers 1987) by Kleene&rsquo;s definition of the
partial recursive functions in terms of the unbounded minimization
operator introduced in
 <a href="#PartRecuFuncPartRecuFuncREC">Section 2.2</a>.
 This characterization has in turn been replaced by machine-based
characterizations such as those of Turing (1937) or Shepherdson &amp;
Sturgis (1963) in later textbooks (e.g., Soare 1987, Cutland 1980)
which are closer in form to informally described computer
programs.</p>

<p>
What is retained in these treatments is an understanding of
computation as a means of operating in an effective manner on finite
combinatorial objects which can still be understood to fall under
the &ldquo;recursive mode of thought&rdquo; as understood by early
theorists such as Skolem, Hilbert, G&ouml;del, and P&eacute;ter. But
at the same time, many of the basic definitions and results in
recursive function theory are only indirectly related to recursive
definability in the informal sense described in this section.
 In light of this, Soare (1996) proposed that recursive function theory should be
renamed <em>computability theory</em> and that we should
accordingly refer to what were traditionally known as the
<em>recursive functions</em> as the <em>computable functions</em>.</p>

<p>
Such a change in terminology has been largely adopted in contemporary
practice and is reflected in recent textbooks such as Cooper (2004)
and Soare (2016). Nonetheless, both sets of terminology are still
widely in use, particularly in philosophical and historical
sources. Readers are thus advised to keep in mind the
terminological discussion at the beginning of
 <a href="#CompTheo">Section 3</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="FormRecu">2. Forms of Recursion</h2>

<p>
NB: Readers looking for a mathematical overview of recursive
functions are advised to start here. Discussion of the historical 
context for the major definitions and results of this section can be
found in <a href="#HistBack">Section 1</a>.</p>
 
<p>
This section presents definitions of the major classes of recursively
defined functions studied in computability theory. Of these the
<em>primitive recursive functions</em> \(\mathbf{PR}\) and the <em>partial recursive
functions</em> \(\mathbf{PartREC}\) are the most fundamental. The former are
based on a formalization of the process of recursion described in the
introduction to this entry and include virtually all number theoretic
functions studied in ordinary mathematics. The partial recursive functions are
formed by closing the primitive recursive functions under the
operation of <em>unbounded minimization</em>&mdash;i.e., that of
searching for the smallest witness to a decidable predicate.  The class of <em> recursive functions </em> \(\mathbf{REC}\)&mdash;i.e., the partial recursive functions which are defined on all inputs&mdash;has traditionally been taken to correspond via Church&rsquo;s Thesis
 (<a href="#ChurThes">Section 1.6</a>) to those which can be effectively computed by an algorithm.

Lowercase Roman letters \(f,g,h,\ldots\) denote functions of type

\(k\))&mdash;i.e., the class of functions with domain
\(\mathbb{N}^k\) and range \(\mathbb{N}\). For a fixed \(j\),
\(f:\mathbb{N}^j \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) expresses that \(f\) is a

Boldface letters \(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{Z},\ldots\) (or

<p>
Calligraphic letters \(\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G},\mathcal{H},\ldots\)

<h3 id="PrimRecuFuncPR">2.1 The Primitive Recursive Functions (<b>PR</b>)</h3>

<h4 id="Defi">2.1.1 Definitions</h4>

<p>
A class \(\mathbf{X}\) of recursively defined functions may be
specified by giving a class of initial functions \(I_{\mathbf{X}}\)
which is then closed under one or more functionals from a class
\(Op_{\mathbf{X}}\). It is in general possible to define a class in
this manner on an arbitrary set of initial functions. However, all of the
function classes considered in this entry will determine functions of
type \(\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\)&mdash;i.e., they will
take \(k\)-tuples of natural numbers as inputs and (if defined)
return a single natural number as output.</p>

<p>
In the case of the primitive recursive functions \(\mathbf{PR}\), the initial
functions include the nullary <em>zero function</em> \(\mathbf{0}\) which
returns the value 0 for all inputs (and can thus be treated as a constant
symbol), \(s(x)\) denotes the unary <em>successor function</em> \(x
\mapsto x + 1\), and \(\pi^k_i\) denotes the \(k\)-ary
<em>projection function</em> on to the \(i\)th argument (where \(0
\leq i &lt; k\))&mdash;i.e., </p> 

\[\pi^k_i(x_0,\ldots,x_i, \ldots x_{k-1}) = x_i\]

<p>
This class of functions will be denoted by \(I_{\mathbf{PR}} =
\{\mathbf{0}, s, \pi^k_i\}\). Note that since
\(\pi^k_i\) is a distinct function for each \(i,k \in \mathbb{N}\),
\(I_{\mathbf{PR}}\) already contains infinitely many functions.</p>

<p>
The functionals of \(\mathbf{PR}\) are those of <em>composition</em> and
<em>primitive recursion</em>. Composition takes \(j\) functions \(g_0,
\ldots, g_{j-1}\) of arity \(k\) and a single function \(f\) of
arity \(j\) and returns their <em>composition</em>&mdash;i.e., the
function </p> 

\[h(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}) =  f(g_0(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}),\ldots,g_{j-1}(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}))\]

<p>
of type \(\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\). As an example,
suppose that \(f\) is the multiplication function \(\textit{mult}(x,y)\), \(g_0\) is the constant 3 function (which we may think of as implicitly taking a single argument), and \(g_1(x)\) is the successor function \(s(x)\). Then the composition of \(f\) with \(g_0\) and \(g_1\) is the unary function \(h(x) = f(g_0(x),g_1(x)) = mult(3, s(x))\) which we would conventionally denote by \(3 \times (x+1)\).</p>

<p>
The operation of composition may be understood as a class of
functionals which for each \(j,k \in \mathbb{N}\) takes as inputs
\(j\) functions \(g_0, \ldots, g_{j-1}\) of arity \(k\) and a single
function \(f\) of arity \(j\) and returns as output the
\(k\)-ary function \(h\) which composes these functions in the manner
just illustrated. This is described by the following scheme:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 2.1:</strong> 

Suppose that \(f:\mathbb{N}^j \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) and \(g_0, \ldots, g_{j-1} : \mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\). Then the term \(\mathcal{Comp}^j_k[f,g_0,\ldots,g_{j-1}]\) denotes the function</p> \[f(g_0(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}),\ldots,g_{j-1}(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}))\]

<p>
of type \(\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}.\)</p>
</div>

<p>
Primitive recursion is also a functional operation. In the simplest
case, it operates by taking a single unary function \(g(x)\) and a
natural number \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) and returns the unary function
defined by </p> 

\[\begin{align}
h(0) &amp; =  n \label{prex1}\\ \nonumber
h(x+1) &amp; =  g(h(x))
\end{align}\]

<p>
In such a definition, the first clause (known as the <em>base
case</em>) determines the value of \(h\) at 0, while the second clause
determines how its value at \(x+1\) depends on its value at \(x\). In
this case it is easy to see that the value of \(x\) determines how
many times the function \(g\) is <em>iterated</em> (i.e., applied to
itself) in determining the value of \(h\). For instance, if \(n = 3\)
and \(g(x) = mult(x,x)\), then \(h(x) = 3^{x+1}\)&mdash;i.e., the
\(x+1\)st iterate of the map \(x \mapsto 3 \times x\).</p>

<p>
The full primitive recursion scheme generalizes (\ref{prex1}) in two
ways. First, it allows the value of the function \(h\) at \(x+1\) to
depend not just on its own value at \(x\), but also on the value
of the variable \(x\) itself. This leads to the scheme </p>

\[\begin{align} \label{prex2}
h(0) &amp; =  n  \\ \nonumber
h(x+1) &amp; =  g(x,h(x))
\end{align}\]

<p>
For instance, the definition of the factorial function \(\fact(x)\)
defined in the introduction to this entry can be obtained via
(\ref{prex2}) with \(n = 1\) and \(g(x_0,x_0) =
times(s(x_0),x_0)\).</p>

<p>
A second possible generalization to (\ref{prex1}) results from
allowing the value of \(h\) to depend on a finite sequence of
auxiliary variables known as <em>parameters</em> which may also be
arguments to the base case. In the case of a single parameter \(x\),
this leads to the scheme </p> 

\[\begin{align}  \label{prex3}
h(x,0) &amp; =  f(x) \\ \nonumber
h(x,y+1) &amp; =  g(x,h(x,y)) 
\end{align}\]

<p>
The addition function \(\textit{add}(x,y)\) may, for instance, be
defined in this way by taking \(f(x_0) = x_0\) and \(g(x_0,x_1) =
s(x_1)\). This definition can also be thought of as specifying that
the sum \(x+y\) is the value obtained by iterating the application of the successor function \(y\) times starting from the initial value \(x\) in the manner of (\ref{prex1}).
Similarly, \(\textit{mult}(x,y)\) may be defined by taking \(f(x_0) =
0\) and \(g(x_0,x_1) = add(x_0,x_1)\). This defines the product \(x
\times y\) as the value obtained by iterating the function
which adds \(x\) to its argument \(y\) times starting from the initial
value 0.</p>

<p>
Such definitions may thus be understood to provide algorithms for
computing the values of the functions so
 defined.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup>
 For observe that each natural number \(n\) is either equal to 0 or
is of the form \(m+1\) for some \(m \in \mathbb{N}\). If we now
introduce the abbreviation \(\overline{n} = s(s(s \ldots
(s(\mathbf{0}))))\) \(n\)-times, the result of applying the
successor function \(s\) to a number denoted by \(\overline{n}\) thus
yields the number denoted by \(\overline{n+1}\). We may thus compute
the value of \(x + y\) using the prior recursive definition of
addition as follows:</p> 

\[\begin{align}\label{prcalc2}
\textit{add}(\overline{2},\overline{3}) &amp; = s(\textit{add}(\overline{2},\overline{2})) \\
&amp; = s(s(add(\overline{2},\overline{1}))) \nonumber\\
&amp; = s(s(s(\textit{add}(\overline{2},\overline{0})))) \nonumber\\
&amp; = s(s(s(\overline{2}))) \nonumber\\
&amp; = s(s(s(s(s(\mathbf{0}))))) \nonumber\\
&amp; = \overline{5}\nonumber\\
\end{align}\]

 <!-- <span id="prcalc2" label="prcalc2">[prcalc2]</span>
-->

<p>
The full definition of the primitive recursion operation combines both
generalizations of (\ref{prex1}) into a single scheme which takes as
arguments a \(k\)-ary function \(f\), a \(k+2\)-ary function \(g\),
and returns a \(k+1\)-ary function \(h\) defined as follows </p>

\[\begin{align}  \label{prscheme}
h(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1},0) &amp; = f(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}) \\   \nonumber
h(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1},y+1) &amp; = g(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1},y,h(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1},y))
\end{align}\]

<p>
Here the first \(k\) arguments \(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}\) to \(g\) are
the parameters, the \(k+1\)st argument \(y\) is the <em>recursion
variable</em>, and the \(k+2\)nd argument \(h(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1},y)\)
gives the prior value of \(h\). An elementary set theoretic argument
shows that for each \(k \in \mathbb{N}\), if \(f\) is \(k\)-ary and
\(g\) is \(k+2\)-ary, then a there is a unique \(k+1\)-ary function
\(h\) satisfying (\ref{prscheme})&mdash;see, e.g., (Moschovakis 1994,
ch. 5).</p>

<p>
It will again be useful to introduce a formal scheme for referring to  functions defined in
this manner:</p>

<div class="indent" id="prfdefn">

<p>
<strong>Definition 2.2:</strong> Suppose that \(f:\mathbb{N}^k
\rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) and \(g: \mathbb{N}^{k+2} \rightarrow
\mathbb{N}\). Then the term \(\mathcal{PrimRec}_k[f,g]\) denotes the
unique function of type \(\mathbb{N}^{k+1} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\)
satisfying (\ref{prscheme}). </p>
</div>

<p>
We may now formally define the class \(\mathbf{PR}\) of primitive recursive
functions as follows:</p>

<div class="indent" id="prdef">

<p>
<strong>Definition 2.3:</strong> 

 The class of <em>primitive recursive functions</em> \(\mathbf{PR}\)
 is the smallest class of functions containing the initial functions
 \(I_{\mathbf{PR}} = \{\mathbf{0}, s, \pi^k_i\}\) and closed under the
 functionals</p> \[Op_{\mathbf{PR}} = \{\mathcal{Comp}^i_j,
 \mathcal{PrimRec}_k\}.\]

</div>

<p>
With the definition of \(\mathbf{PR}\) in place, we may also define
what it means for a relation \(R \subseteq \mathbb{N}^k\) to be
primitive recursive:</p>

<div class="indent" id="prereldefn">

<p>
<strong>Definition 2.4:</strong> \(R \subseteq \mathbb{N}^k\) is a
<em>primitive recursive relation</em> just in case its characteristic
function </p> 

\[\chi_R(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{ if } R(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}) \\  0 &amp; \text{ if } \neg R(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1})
\end{cases}
\]

<p>
is a primitive recursive function. </p>
</div>

<p>

 <a href="#prereldefn">Definition 2.4</a>
 thus conventionalizes the characterization of a primitive recursive
relation \(R \subseteq \mathbb{N}^k\) as one for which there exists an
algorithm similar to that illustrated above which returns the output 1
on input \(\vec{n}\) if \(R\) holds of \(\vec{n}\) and the output 0 if
\(R\) does not hold of \(\vec{n}\). As will become clear below, most
sets and relations on the natural numbers which are considered in
everyday mathematics&mdash;e.g., the set <em>PRIMES</em> of prime
numbers or the relation 

\[\textit{DIV} = \{\langle n, m \rangle : n
\textit{ divides } m \textit{ without remainder}\}\]

&mdash;are primitive recursive.</p>

<p>
The foregoing definition specifies \(\mathbf{PR}\) as the <em>minimal
closure</em> of \(I_{\mathbf{PR}}\) under the functions in
\(Op_{\mathbf{PR}}\). In other words, \(\mathbf{PR}\) may be equivalently
defined as the subclass of \(\bigcup_{k \in \mathbb{N}}(\mathbb{N}^k
\rightarrow \mathbb{N})\) satisfying the following properties:</p>

\[\label{prmc}\begin{equation}\end{equation}\]

<dl class="sentag" style="margin-top:-2.2em">
<dt id="prmc"></dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>i.</dt>
<dd>\(I_{\mathbf{PR}} \subseteq \mathbf{PR}\)</dd>
<dt>ii.</dt>
<dd> For all \(j,k \in \mathbb{N}\) and \(f,g_0,\ldots,g_{k-1} \in
\mathbf{PR}\), if \(f\) is \(j\)-ary and \(g_i\) is \(k\)-ary (for
\(1 \leq i \leq n\)) then \(\mathcal{Comp}^j_k[f,g_0,\ldots,g_{j-1}]
\in \mathbf{PR}\).</dd>
<dt>iii.</dt>
<dd> For all \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) and \(f,g \in \mathbf{PR}\), if
\(f\) is \(k\)-ary and \(g\) is \(k+2\)-ary then
\(\mathcal{PrimRec}_k[f,g] \in \mathbf{PR}\).</dd>
<dt>iv.</dt>
<dd> No functions are members of \(\mathbf{PR}\) unless they can be defined
by i&ndash;iii.</dd>
</dl> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Another consequence of
 <a href="#prdef">Definition 2.3</a>
 is thus that each function \(f \in \mathbf{PR}\) possesses a
specification which shows how it may be defined from the initial
functions \(I_{\mathbf{PR}}\) in terms of a finite number of
applications of composition and primitive recursion. This process may
be illustrated by further considering the definitions of
the functions \(\textit{add}(x,y)\) and \(\textit{mult}(x,y)\) given
above.</p>

<p>
Note first that although the familiar recursive definitions of
addition (\ref{defnadd}) and multiplication (\ref{defnmult}) fit the
format of (\ref{prex3}), they do not fit the format of
(\ref{prscheme}) which in this case requires that the argument \(g\)
to the primitive recursion scheme be a \(3\)-ary function. It is,
however, possible to provide a definition of \(\textit{add}(x,y)\) in
the official form by taking \(f(x_0) = \pi^1_0(x_0)\)&mdash;i.e., the
identity function&mdash;and \(g(x_0,x_1,x_2) =
\mathcal{Comp}^1_3[s,\pi^3_1]\)&mdash;i.e., the function which results
from composing the successor function with the \(3\)-ary projection
function on to its second argument. The expression
\(\mathcal{PrimRec}_1[\pi^1_0,\mathcal{Comp}^1_3[s,\pi^3_1]]\) may then be
understood as a term which encodes the definition we have
provided for addition. Multiplication can then be defined via
(\ref{prscheme}) with \(f = \mathbf{0}\) and \(g(x_0,x_1,x_2) =
\mathcal{Comp}^2_3[add,\pi^3_0,\pi^3_2]\). Thus

\[\mathcal{PrimRec}_1[\mathbf{0},\mathcal{Comp}^2_3[add,\pi^3_0,\pi^3_2]]\]

&mdash;or in explicit form 

\[\mathcal{PrimRec}_1[\mathbf{0},\mathcal{Comp}^2_3[\mathcal{PrimRec}_1[\pi^1_0,\mathcal{Comp}^1_3[s,\pi^3_1]],\pi^3_0,\pi^3_2]]\]

&mdash;can be taken as a similar term encoding the definition of multiplication
we have abbreviated by \(\textit{mult}(x,y)\).</p>

<p>
These examples illustrate that the simpler recursion schemes which are
employed in many informal recursive definitions may be assimilated to
 <a href="#prdef">Definition 2.3</a>&mdash;e.g.,
 the function \(h(x,y)\) defined in (\ref{prex3}) maybe obtained as
\(\mathcal{PrimRec}_1[f,\mathcal{Comp}^2_3[g,\pi^3_1,\pi^3_2]]\). Repeated
use of this and similar observations will be made (generally without
comment) in the examples provided in  <a href="#Exam">Section 2.1.2</a>.</p>
 

<p>
Another consequence of the fact that <em>every</em> \(f \in
\mathbf{PR}\) is defined by a term given in this manner by (\ref{prmc}) is the
following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 2.1:</strong> The class of functions \(\mathbf{PR}\) is
countable.</p>
</div>

<p>
This can be demonstrated by showing that it is possible to enumerate
\(\mathbf{PR}\) as \(f_0,f_1,f_2,\ldots\) by introducing a G&ouml;del
numbering of terms formed from the expressions \(\mathbf{0},s,\pi^k_i,
\mathcal{Comp}^j_k\) and \(\mathcal{PrimRec}_k\) in the manner described in
 <a href="#AritReprGodeFirsIncoTheo">Section 1.3</a>.
 Since there are uncountably many functions of type \(\mathbb{N}^k
\rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) for all \(k &gt; 0\), this observation also
provides a non-constructive demonstration that there exist number
theoretic functions which are not primitive recursive.</p>

<h4 id="Exam">2.1.2 Examples</h4>

<p>
Almost all number theoretic functions and relations encountered in ordinary
mathematics can be shown to be primitive recursive. In order to
illustrate the extent of this class, we will present here a
standard sequence of definitions which can be traced historically to
Skolem (1923). This can be used to show that the sequence coding
\(\langle \ldots \rangle\) and decoding \((\cdot)_i\) operations
defined below are primitive recursive.  This is in turn required for
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s arithmetization of syntax (see
 <a href="#AritReprGodeFirsIncoTheo">Section 1.3</a>)
 as well as results like the Normal Form Theorem
 (<a href="#knft">2.3</a>)  which will be discussed below.</p>

<h5><u>Constant functions</u></h5>

<p>
For each \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) the constant \(k\)-function defined
as \(\const_k(x) = k\) is primitive recursive. This is because we can
inductively define </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
 \const_0(x) &amp; = \mathbf{0}\\
 \text{ and  }\\
 \const_{k+1}(x) &amp; = \mathcal{Comp}^1_1[s,\const_k] \\
&amp; =  s(s(s \ldots (s(\mathbf{0})))) \\
&amp; =_{\textrm{df}} \overline{k+1} \end{aligned}\]

<h5><u>Exponentiation, super-exponentiation</u>, &hellip;</h5>

<p>
We have already seen that the addition function \(\textit{add}(x,y)\) can be defined by primitive recursion in terms of repeated application of successor and that the multiplication function \(\mathit{mult}(x,y)\) can be defined by primitive recursion in terms of repeated application of addition.  We can continue this sequence by observing
that the exponentiation function \(x^y\) can be defined by primitive
recursion in terms of repeated multiplication as follows: </p>

\[\begin{align}  \label{exp}
\textit{exp}(x,0) &amp; =  \overline{1}\\ \nonumber
\textit{exp}(x+1,y) &amp; =  \textit{mult}(x,\textit{exp}(x,y)) 
\end{align}\]

<p>
The super-exponentiation function</p> 

\[x \uarrow y = \underbrace{x^{x^{\udots^x}}}_{y \textrm{ times}}\]

<p>
can be defined by primitive recursion in terms of repeated
exponentiation as as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{align}  \label{superexp}
\textit{supexp}(x,0) &amp; =  \overline{1}\\ \nonumber
\textit{supexp}(x+1,y) &amp; =  \textit{exp}(x,\textit{supexp}(x,y)) 
\end{align}\]

<p>
The sequence of functions</p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\alpha_0(x,y) &amp; = x + y, \\
\alpha_1(x,y) &amp; = x \times y, \\
\alpha_2(x,y) &amp; = x^y, \\
\alpha_3(x,y) &amp; = x \uarrow y, \\
 &amp;\vdots\\
\end{aligned}\]

<p>
whose \(i+1\)st member is defined in terms of primitive recursion of
the \(i\)th member form a hierarchy of functions whose values grow
increasingly quickly in proportion to their inputs. While each
function in this sequence is primitive recursive, we can also consider the function
\(\alpha(x,y)\) defined as \(\alpha_x(y,y)\)&mdash;a version of the
so-called <em>Ackermann-P&eacute;ter function</em> defined in
 <a href="#AckePeteFunc">Section 1.4</a>&mdash;whose
 values are not bounded by any fixed function \(\alpha_i\). 
 As it can be shown that the values of   \(\alpha(x,y)\)  are not bounded by any of the functions \(\alpha_i(x,y)\), this shows that \(\alpha(x,y)\) cannot be defined by any finite number of applications of the scheme \(\mathcal{PrimRec}_1\).   This provides a constructive proof that there exist functions of type \(\mathbb{N}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) which are not primitive recursive.</p>

<h5><u>Predecessor and proper subtraction</u></h5>

<p>
The <em>proper predecessor</em> function is given by </p> 

\[\textit{pred}(y) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{ if } y = 0 \\ y - 1 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]

<p>
This function is primitive recursive since it may be defined as </p>

\[\begin{align}  \label{pred}
\textit{pred}(y) &amp; = 0\\ \nonumber
\textit{pred}(y+1) &amp; = y
\end{align}\]

<p>
Note that the second clause of (\ref{pred}) does not depend on the prior value
of \(\textit{pred}(y)\). But this definition can still be conformed to
the scheme (\ref{prscheme}) by taking \(f(x_0) = \mathbf{0}\) and
\(g(x_0,x_1,x_2) = \pi^3_1\).</p>

<p>
The <em>proper subtraction</em> function is given by </p> 

\[x \dotminus y = \begin{cases} x - y &amp; \text{ if } y \leq x \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]

<p>
This function is also primitive recursive since it may be defined as
</p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{dotminus}
x \dotminus 0 &amp; = x \\ \nonumber
x \dotminus (y+1) &amp; = \textit{pred}(x \dotminus y)
\end{align}\]

<h5><u>Absolute difference, signum, minimum, and maximum</u></h5>

<p>
The absolute difference function is defined as </p> 

\[|x - y| = \begin{cases} x - y &amp; \text{ if } y \leq x \\ y - x &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]

<p>
\(|x - y|\) may be defined by composition as \((x \dotminus y) + (y
\dotminus x)\) and is hence primitive recursive since \(\dotminus\)
is.</p>

<p>
The <em>signum</em> function is defined as </p> 

\[\textit{sg}(x) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{ if } x \neq 0 \\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]

<p>
This function may be defined by composition as \(\textit{sg}(x) = 1
\dotminus (1 \dotminus x)\) and is hence primitive recursive as is the
<em>inverted signum</em> function defined by
\(\overline{\textit{sg}}(x) = 1 \dotminus \textit{sg}(y)\) which
returns 1 if \(x = 0\) and 1 otherwise.</p>

<p>
The minimum and maximum functions may be similarly defined by
composition from functions previously seen to be primitive recursive
as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\min(x,y) &amp; = \overline{\textit{sg}}(x \dotminus y) \times x + \overline{\textit{sg}}(y \dotminus x) \times y\\
\max(x,y) &amp; = \textit{sg}(x \dotminus y) \times x + \textit{sg}(y \dotminus x) \times y\end{aligned}\]

<h5><u>Order and identity</u></h5>

<p>
The characteristic functions of the <em>less than</em> relation
(\(&lt;\)) and <em>equality</em> relation (\(=\)) on the natural
numbers are definable as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\chi_&lt;(x,y) &amp; = \textit{sg}(y \dotminus x) \\ \nonumber
\chi_=(x,y) &amp; =  1 \dotminus (\textit{sg}(x \dotminus y) + \textit{sg}(y \dotminus x))\end{aligned}\]

<p>
These relations are hence primitive recursive.</p>

<p>
As the <em>less than or equal to</em> relation (\(\leq\)) is logically
equivalent to \(x &lt; y \vee x = y\) it will follow from the next set
of observations that this relation is also primitive recursive. The is
additionally true of \(x &gt; y\), \(x \geq y\) and \(x \neq
y\).</p>

<h5><u>Closure under propositional operations</u></h5>

<p>
The set of primitive recursive relations is <em>closed under boolean
operations</em>. In other words, if \(P(\vec{x})\) and \(Q(\vec{x})\)
are primitive recursive, then so are \(\neg P(\vec{x})\), \(P(\vec{x})
\wedge Q(\vec{x})\), \(P(\vec{x}) \vee Q(\vec{x})\), \(P(\vec{x})
\rightarrow Q(\vec{x}),\) and \(P(\vec{x}) \leftrightarrow
Q(\vec{x})\).</p>

<p>
Given the interdefinability of the classical connectives, this follows
upon noting the following: </p> 

\[\begin{align*}
\chi_{\neg P}(\vec{x}) &amp; = 1 \dotminus \chi_{P}(\vec{x}) \\ 
\chi_{P \wedge Q}(\vec{x}) &amp; = \chi_{P}(\vec{x}) \times \chi_{Q}(\vec{x})
\end{align*}\]

<h5><u>Bounded sums and products</u></h5>

<p>
Suppose that \(f(\vec{x},z)\) is primitive recursive. Then the
<em>bounded sum</em> \(g(\vec{x},y) = \Sigma_{i=0}^y f(\vec{x},i)\)
and the <em>bounded product</em> \(h(\vec{x},y) = \Pi_{i=0}^y
f(\vec{x},i)\) are both primitive recursive as they may be
respectively defined as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
g(\vec{x},0) &amp; =  f(\vec{x},0) \\ \nonumber
g(\vec{x},y+1) &amp; = g(\vec{x},y) + f(\vec{x},y+1) \\  \nonumber
h(\vec{x},0) &amp; =  f(\vec{x},0) \\ \nonumber 
h(\vec{x},y+1) &amp; = g(\vec{x},y) \times f(\vec{x},y+1) \end{aligned}\]

<h5><u>Closure under bounded quantification</u></h5>

<p>
The set of primitive recursive relations is also closed under
<em>bounded quantification</em>&mdash;i.e., if \(R(\vec{x},z)\) is a
primitive recursive relation, then so are the relations \(\forall z
\leq y R(\vec{x},z)\) and \(\exists z \leq y R(\vec{x},z)\). These may
be respectively defined as follows as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
u_R(\vec{x},y) &amp; =_{\textrm{df}} \chi_{\forall z \leq y R(\vec{x},z)}(\vec{x}) = \Pi_{i=0}^y \chi_R(\vec{x},i) \\ \nonumber
e_R(\vec{x},y)  &amp; =_{\textrm{df}} \chi_{\exists z \leq R(\vec{x},z)}(\vec{x}) = sg\left(\Sigma_{i=0}^y \chi_R(\vec{x},i)\right)\end{aligned}\]

<h5><u>Closure under bounded minimization</u></h5>

<p>
The set of primitive recursive relations is also closed under
<em>bounded minimization</em>. This is to say that if \(R(\vec{x},z)\)
is a primitive recursive relation, then so is the function
\(m_R(\vec{x},y)\) which returns the least \(z\) less than or equal to \(y\) such
that \(R(\vec{x},z)\) holds if such a \(z\) exists and \(y+1\)
otherwise&mdash;i.e., </p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{boundedmin}
 m_R(\vec{x},y) = 
\begin{cases}
\text{the least $z \leq y$ such that $R(\vec{x},z)$} &amp; \text{ if such a $z$ exists} \\
y + 1 &amp; \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{align}\]

<p>
To see this, observe that if \(R(\vec{x},z)\) is primitive recursive,
then so is \(\forall z \leq y \neg R(\vec{x},z)\). It is then not
difficult to verify that </p> 

\[m_R(\vec{x},y) = \Sigma_{i=0}^y \chi_{\forall z \leq y \neg R(\vec{x},z)}(\vec{x},i).\]

<h5><u>Divisibility and primality</u></h5>

<p>
A natural number \(y\) is said to be <em>divisible</em> by \(x\) just
in case there exists a \(z\) such that \(x \times z = y\)&mdash;i.e.,
\(x\) divides \(y\) without remainder. In this case we write \(x
\divides y\). Note that if \(x \divides y\) holds, then this must be
witnessed by a divisor \(z \leq y\) such that \(x \times z = y\). We
may thus define \(x \divides y\) in the following manner which shows
that it is primitive recursive: </p> 

\[x \divides y \Longleftrightarrow \exists z \leq y(x \times z = y)\]

<p>
We may also define the <em>non-divisibility</em> relations \(x
\notdivides y\) as \(\neg(x \divides y)\) which shows that it too is
primitive recursive.</p>

<p>
Next recall that a natural number \(x\) is <em>prime</em> just in case
it is greater than 1 and is divisible by only 1 and itself. We may
thus define the relation \(\textit{Prime}(x)\) in the following manner
which shows that it is primitive recursive: </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\textit{Prime}(x) \Longleftrightarrow \overline{1} &lt; x \wedge \forall z \leq x(z \divides x \rightarrow (z = \overline{1} \vee z = x))\end{aligned}\]

<p>
The primes form a familiar infinite sequence \(p_0 = 2,\) \(p_1 = 3,\)
\(p_2 = 5,\) \(p_3 = 7,\) \(p_4 = 11,\)&hellip;. Let \(p(x) =
p_x\)&mdash;i.e., the function which returns the \(x\)th prime
number. \(p(x)\) can be defined by primitive recursion relative to the
function \(\nextPrime(x)\) which returns the least \(y &gt; x\) such
that \(y\) is prime as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
p(0) &amp; = \overline{2} \\ \nonumber
p(x+1) &amp; = \nextPrime(p(x))\end{aligned}\]

<p>
Recall that Euclid&rsquo;s Theorem states that there is always a prime
number between \(x\) and \(x! + 1\) and also that \(x! = \fact(x)\) is
primitive recursive. It thus follows that \(\nextPrime(x)\) can be
defined via bounded minimization as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\nextPrime(x) = m_{x &lt; z \ \wedge \ \textit{Prime}(z)}(x,\fact(x)+1)\end{aligned}\]

<p>
It thus follows that \(p(x)\) is primitive recursive.</p>

<h5><u>Sequences and coding</u></h5>

<p>
The foregoing sequence of definitions provides some evidence for the
robustness of the class of primitive recursive relations and
functions. Further evidence is provided by the fact that it is
possible to develop the machinery for coding and decoding finite
sequences of natural numbers and for performing various combinatorial
operations on sequences&mdash;e.g., adjunction of an element,
concatenation, extracting a subsequence, substituting one element for
another, etc. The primitive recursiveness of these operations
underpins G&ouml;del&rsquo;s arithmetization of syntax as described in
 <a href="#AritReprGodeFirsIncoTheo">Section 1.3</a>.
 We present here only the basic definitions required to demonstrate
the primitive recursiveness of the \(k\)-tupling and projection
functions which are required for results in computability theory such
as the Normal Form Theorem
 (<a href="#knft">2.3</a>)
 discussed below.</p>

<p>
Given a finite sequence of natural numbers \(n_0,n_1,\ldots,n_{k-1}\)
we define its <em>code</em> to be the number </p> 

\[\begin{align}
 \label{primecode}
p_0^{n_0 + 1} \times p_1^{n_1 + 1} \times p_2^{n_2 + 1} \times \ldots \times p_{k-1}^{n_{k-1}+1}
\end{align}\]

<p>
where \(p_i\) is the \(i\)th prime number as defined above. In
other words, the code of \(n_0,n_1,\ldots,n_{k-1}\) is the natural
number resulting from taking the product of the numbers \(p_i^{n_i +
1}\) for \(0 \leq i \leq k-1\). This will be denote by \(\langle
n_0,n_1,\ldots,n_{k-1} \rangle\)&mdash;e.g., </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\langle 3,1,4,1,5 \rangle &amp; = 2^{4} \times 3^{2} \times 5^{5} \times 7^{2} \times 11^{6} \\
&amp; = 39062920050000.\\
\end{aligned}
\]

<p>
(Note that 1 is added to each exponent so that, e.g., 3, 1, 4, 1, 5
has a distinct code from that of 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 0, etc.&mdash;i.e., so
that the coding operation is <em>injective</em>.)</p>

<p>
The operation which takes a sequence of arbitrary length to its code
does not have a fixed arity and hence is not given by a single
primitive recursive function. But it is not hard to see that if we
restrict attention to sequences of given length \(k\), then
\(\langle n_0,n_1,\ldots,n_{k-1} \rangle : \mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow
\mathbb{N}\) is primitive recursive as it is simply the bounded
product given by (\ref{primecode}). Consider next the function
\(\textit{element}(s,i) = n_i\) where \(s = \langle
n_0,n_1,\ldots,n_{k-1} \rangle\) and \(0 \leq i \leq k-1\) and which
returns 0 when \(i\) is not in this range or \(s = 0\) or 1 (and
thus not a code of a sequence). In order to see that
\(\textit{element}(s,i)\) is also primitive recursive, first observe
that it is possible to recover \(\textit{len}(s)\)&mdash;i.e., the
<em>length</em> of the sequence coded by \(s\)&mdash;by searching for
the least \(i &lt; s\) such that \(p_i \divides s\) and \(p_{i+1}
\notdivides s\). Since \(s\) also bounds all the primes \(p_i\)
which divide it we may define </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
len(s) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{ if $s = 0$ or $s = 1$} \\
1 + m_{p_z \divides s \wedge p_{z+1} \notdivides s}(s,s) &amp; \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}\end{aligned}\]

<p>
It is straightforward to see that a function defined by cases with
primitive recursive conditions is primitive recursive. So
\(\textit{len}(s)\) is primitive recursive as well.</p>

<p>
Finally observe that \(\textit{element}(s,i)\) is equal to the
smallest exponent \(n\) such that \(p_i^{n+1} \divides s\) but
\(p_i^{n+2} \notdivides s\) and that such an exponent is also bounded
by \(s\). We may thus provide a primitive recursive definition of
\(\textit{element}(s,i)\) as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\textit{element}(s,i) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{ if  $len(s) \leq i$ or $s = 0$ or $s = 1$}\\
m_{p_i^{z+1} \divides s \wedge p_i^{z+2} \notdivides s}(s,s) \dotminus 1 &amp; \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}\end{aligned}\]

<p>
The conventional abbreviation \((s)_i = \textit{element}(s,i)\) will
be employed for this function below.</p>

<h4 id="AddiClosPropPrimRecuFunc">2.1.3 Additional closure properties of the primitive recursive functions</h4>

<p>
The primitive recursive functions and relations encompass a broad
class including virtually all those encountered in ordinary
mathematics outside of logic or computability theory. This is
illustrated in part by the fact that \(\mathbf{PR}\) contains functions such
as \(supexp(x,y)\) which grow far faster than those whose values we
can feasibly compute in practice in the sense studied in <a href="../computational-complexity/index.html">computational complexity theory</a>. But the robustness of the class \(\mathbf{PR}\) is also attested to by the fact that its definition
is invariant with respect to a variety of modifications&mdash;e.g.,
with respect to the classes of initial functions \(I_{\mathbf{PR}}\)
and functionals \(Op_{\mathbf{PR}}\) on which its definition is
based.</p>

<p>
As an initial illustration, consider the following scheme of so-called
<em>pure iteration</em>: </p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{pureiter}
h(0,y) &amp; =  y \\ \nonumber
h(x+1,y) &amp; = g(h(x,y))
\end{align}\]

<p>
It is easy to see that the function \(h\) defined by (\ref{pureiter}) from \(g\) in this manner is the \(x^{\mathrm{th}}\)&ndash;iterate of \(g\)&mdash; i.e., \(g^{x}(y)=_{\mathrm{df}} g(g(\ldots g(y)))\) \(x\)&ndash;times with the convention that \(g^0(y) = y\).  We will denote this functional by \(\mathcal{Iter}[g,x]\). The scheme (\ref{pureiter}) thus generalizes (\ref{prex1}) by making the value of base case an argument to \(h\). But it is an apparent restriction of
(\ref{prscheme}) in the sense that \(h\) cannot depend on either the
recursion variable or additional parameters.</p>

<p>
Suppose we now consider an alternative class of initial functions
\(In_{\mathbf{IT}}\) containing \(s,\pi^k_i\), the binary coding
function \(\langle x,y \rangle\), and the decoding functions \((x)_0\)
and \((x)_1\) defined at the end of 
 <a href="#Exam">Section 2.1.2</a>.
(Note that these operate analogously to the first and second production
functions \(\pi^2_0\) and \(\pi^2_1\) operating on <em>codes</em> of
ordered pairs.) Now define \(\mathbf{IT}\) to be the smallest class of
functions containing \(In_{\mathbf{IT}}\) and closed under the
functionals \(Op_{\mathbf{IT}} =
\{\mathcal{Comp}^i_j,\mathcal{Iter}\}\).</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 2.1</strong> (Robinson 1947): The class \(\mathbf{IT}\) is
equal to the class \(\mathbf{PR}\) of primitive recursive functions.</p>
</div>

<p>
This illustrates that if we slightly enlarge the class of initial
functions, it is still possible to obtain the entire class \(\mathbf{PR}\)
via a scheme of functional iteration which at first appears less
general than primitive recursion. See Odifreddi (1989, ch. I.5) for an
account of further improvements which can be obtained in this
direction.</p>

<p>
Other results show that the class \(\mathbf{PR}\) also remains stable if
primitive recursion is replaced with other schemes which may initially
appear more general. The most familiar of these is the scheme of
<em>course of values recursion</em> which is traditionally illustrated
using the so-called <em>Fibonacci function</em> \(\fib(x)\) which was
briefly discussed at the beginning of
 <a href="#HistBack">Section 1</a>.
 This may be defined as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{fibdefn}
fib(0) &amp; = 0\\ \nonumber
fib(1) &amp; = 1\\ \nonumber
fib(y+1) &amp; = fib(y) + fib(y-1)
\end{align}\]

<p>
This definition can readily be used to calculate the values of
\(\fib(x)\) in a recursive manner&mdash;e.g., </p> 

\[\begin{aligned} 
\fib(4) &amp;= \fib(3) + \fib(2) \\ 
  &amp;= (\fib(2) + \fib(1)) + (\fib(1)+\fib(0))  \\ 
  &amp;= ((\fib(1) + \fib(0)) + 1) + (1 + 1) \\ 
  &amp;= ((1 + 1) + 1) + (1 + 1) \\ 
&amp; = 5
\end{aligned}\]

<p>
This gives rises to the familiar sequence 0, 1, 1, 2, 5, 8, 13, 21,
34, 55, 89, 144,&hellip; wherein \(F_0 =0,\) \(F_1 = 1,\) and
\(F_{i+2} = F_{i+1} + F_i.\) Note, however, the definition
(\ref{fibdefn}) cannot be directly assimilated to the primitive
recursion scheme (\ref{prscheme}) since the third clause defines the
value of \(\fib(y+1)\) in terms of <em>both</em> \(\fib(y)\) and
\(\fib(y-1)\). It is, however, still possible to show that \(\fib \in
\mathbf{PR}\). One means of doing this is to again make use of the
binary coding and projection functions to first define an auxiliary
function \(g(0) = \langle 0,1 \rangle\) and</p> 

\[g(y+1) = \langle (g(y))_1,(g(y))_0 + (g(y))_1 \rangle\]

<p>
which enumerates the pairs \(\langle F_0,F_1 \rangle\), \(\langle F_1,
F_2 \rangle, \ldots\) It is then easy to see that \(\fib(y) =
(g(y))_0\).</p>

<p>
(\ref{fibdefn}) is thus an instance where the value of the function
\(h\) at \(y\) depends on the values \(h(y-1)\) and \(h(y-2)\) of its
graph (for \(y \geq 2\)). It is, of course, also possible to consider
cases where \(h(y)\) depends on an arbitrary number of its preceding
values \(h(0), \ldots, h(y-1)\). To this end, suppose we are given
\(h(\vec{x},y)\) and then define </p> 

\[\begin{align*}
\widetilde{h}(\vec{x},y) &amp;= \Pi_{i = 0}^y p_i^{h(\vec{x},i)+1} \\
&amp; = \langle h(\vec{x},0), \ldots, h(\vec{x},y) \rangle.\\
\end{align*}
\]

<p>
We then say that \(h(\vec{x},y)\) is defined by <em>course of values
recursion</em> from \(f(\vec{x})\) and \(g(\vec{x},y,z)\) if </p>

\[\begin{aligned}
h(\vec{x},0) &amp; = f(\vec{x}) \\ \nonumber
h(\vec{x},y + 1) &amp; = g(\vec{x},y,\widetilde{h}(\vec{x},y))\end{aligned}\]

<p>
Suppose that we now let \(\mathcal{CV}_k[f,g]\) denote the
corresponding functional operation and let \(\mathbf{CV}\) be the
smallest class of functions containing \(In_{\mathbf{PR}}\) and closed
under \(\mathcal{Comp}^j_k\) and \(\mathcal{CV}_k\). Then since it is
easy to see that \(\widetilde{h}(\vec{x},y)\) is primitive recursive
if \(h(\vec{x},y)\) is, we also have the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 2.2</strong> (P&eacute;ter 1935): The class
\(\mathbf{CV}\) is equal to the class \(\mathbf{PR}\) of primitive recursive
functions.</p>
</div>

<p>
Since course of values recursion is occasionally used in mathematical practice,
it is significant that it does not lead outside the class of primitive
recursive functions. There are, however, a number of other possible
ways in which the scheme (\ref{prscheme}) might also be generalized,
including what are known as <em>double recursion</em> and <em>nested
recursion</em>. The definition of the Ackermann-P&eacute;ter function
\(\pi(x,y)\) in
 <a href="#AckePeteFunc">Section 1.4</a>
 exhibits the former since its value at \(x,y\) depends on its value
at <em>both</em> \(x-1\) and \(y-1\) and also the latter since the
occurrence of the defined function \(\pi(x,y)\) is
&ldquo;nested&rdquo; within itself (rather than an auxiliary function)
on the righthand side of the third clause. Although such definitions
arise less often in practice, they are important historically due to
their occurrence in Hilbert&rsquo;s original discussion of recursion
(see
 <a href="#AritReprGodeFirsIncoTheo">Section 1.3</a>).
 Such schemes were considered systematically by P&eacute;ter (1967)
who showed that unnested double recursion on its own also does not
lead outside the class of primitive recursive functions.</p>

<h3 id="PartRecuFuncPartRecuFuncREC">2.2 The Partial Recursive Functions (<b>PartREC</b>) and the Recursive Functions (<b>REC</b>)</h3>

<p>
We have now seen two ways of showing that there exist number theoretic
functions which are not primitive recursive&mdash;i.e., by observing
that while there are only countably many primitive recursive functions
there are uncountably many functions of type \(\mathbb{N}^k
\rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) (\(k &gt; 0\)) and also by constructing a
function such as \(\alpha(x,y) = \alpha_x(y,y)\) which grows faster
than any primitive recursive function. A third proof&mdash;originally
due to Hilbert &amp; Bernays (1934, ch. 7)&mdash;is based on the
observation that it is possible to enumerate the class \(\mathbf{PR}\) as
\(g_0(x),g_1(x),g_2(x), \ldots\)&mdash;e.g., by G&ouml;del numbering
the sorts of definitions considered at the end of
 <a href="#Defi">Section 2.1.1</a>.
 If we then consider the modified diagonal function </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\delta(x) = g_x(x) + 1\end{aligned}\]

<p>
it is easy to see that this  function also cannot be primitive recursive. For if
\(\delta(x)\) coincided with some function \(g_j(x)\) in the
enumeration, then we would have \(g_j(j) = \delta(j) = g_j(j) + 1\), a
contradiction. Note that this also shows that relative to such an
enumeration the <em>universal function</em> \(u_1(i,x) =
g_i(\vec{x})\) for unary primitive recursive functions cannot itself
be primitive recursive as we could otherwise define \(\delta(x)\) as
\(u_1(x,x) + 1\). Hilbert &amp; Bernays (1939, ch. 5) would later discuss
this observation in regard to what has become known as their
<em>denotational paradox</em>&mdash;see, e.g., (Priest 1997).</p>

<p>
On the other hand, there are intuitively effective procedures for
computing each of these functions. For instance, in the case of
\(\delta(x)\) we can proceed as follows: </p>

<ol type="i">

<li>use \(x\) to construct the definition of \(g_x(y)\); </li>

<li> compute the value of \(g_x(x)\) by performing the corresponding
primitive recursive calculation; </li>

<li> add 1 and halt. </li>
</ol>

<p>
This illustrates that although \(\alpha(x,y)\), \(\delta(x)\), and
\(u_1(i,x)\) are not primitive recursive, they are still
<em>effectively computable</em> in the sense discussed in
 <a href="#ChurThes">Section 1.6</a>.
 There is thus a natural motivation for seeking to expand the
definition of the class \(\mathbf{PR}\) so as to encompass such intuitively
computable functions.</p>

<p>
One means by which this can be accomplished builds on the observation
that the bounded minimization operation \(m_R(\vec{x},y)\) admits to a
straightforward algorithmic characterization&mdash;i.e., to compute
the value of \(m_R(\vec{x},y)\) successively check \(R(\vec{x},0),\)
\(R(\vec{x},1),\) &hellip;, \(R(\vec{x},z),\)&hellip; giving output
\(z\) and halting as soon as \(R(\vec{x},z)\) holds and \(y+1\) if no
positive instance is found before \(z = y\). This can be generalized
to the so-called <em>unbounded search</em> operation. In particular,
given a relation \(R(\vec{x},y)\) we can define the operation
\(\mu_R(\vec{x},z)\) which returns the least \(z\) such that
\(R(\vec{x},z)\) if such a \(z\) exists and is undefined otherwise.
Note that if \(R(\vec{x},y)\) is primitive recursive, then it is still
possible to effectively search for the value of \(\mu_R(\vec{x},y)\)
by successively checking \(R(\vec{x},0),\) \(R(\vec{x},1),\)&hellip;.
But since no upper bound is specified in advance, we are not
guaranteed that this procedure will always terminate. In particular,
if there is no \(z \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(R(\vec{x},z)\) holds,
then the procedure will continue indefinitely. In this case, we
stipulate that \(\mu_R(\vec{x},y)\) is <em>undefined</em>, from which
it follows that \(\mu_R(\vec{x},y)\) will correspond to what is known
as a <em>partial function</em>&mdash;a notion which is made precise by
the following sequence of definitions.</p>

<h4 id="Defi_1">2.2.1 Definitions</h4>

<p>
The class of so-called <em>partial recursive functions</em> is
obtained from our prior definition of \(\mathbf{PR}\) by closing under an
operation similar to \(\mu_R(\vec{x},z)\) which is applied to
functions rather than relations. In order to define this class, we
first introduce the following conventions regarding <em>partial
functions</em> which extends those given at the beginning of
 <a href="#FormRecu">Section 2</a>:</p>
 
<ul>

<li>

<p>
A function \(f:\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) is called
<em>total</em> if \(f(\vec{n})\) is defined for all \(\vec{n} \in
\mathbb{N}^k\). Otherwise \(f(\vec{x})\) is called
<em>partial</em>.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
We write \(f(\vec{n})\darrow\) to express that \(f(\vec{x})\) is
defined at \(\vec{n}\) and additionally \(f(\vec{n})\darrow = m\)
if \(f(\vec{n})\) is defined at \(\vec{n}\) and equal to \(m\).
Otherwise we write \(f(\vec{n})\uarrow\) to express that
\(f(\vec{x})\) is undefined at \(\vec{n}.\)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The <em>domain</em> of \(f(\vec{n})\) is the set \(\textrm{dom}(f) =
\{\vec{n} \in \mathbb{N}^k : f(\vec{n}) \darrow\}\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
We write \(f(\vec{x}) \simeq g(\vec{x})\) just in case for all
\(\vec{n} \in \mathbb{N}\), either \(f(\vec{n})\) and \(g(\vec{n})\)
are both undefined or are both defined and equal.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Suppose we are given a partial function \(f(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1},y)\).
We now introduce terms of the form \(\mu y f(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1},y)\)
defined as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{murec}
\mu y f(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1},y) 
  = \begin{cases} z &amp; \text{if } z \text{ is such that } \\
    &amp;\:\: f(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1},z) = 0 \text{ and } \\
    &amp;\:\: \forall w &lt; z(f(x_0,\ldots,x_1,w)\darrow \neq 0) \\
\uarrow &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{align}\]

<p>
In other words, \(\mu y f(\vec{n},y)\) is equal to the least \(m\)
such that \(f(\vec{n},m) = 0\) provided that such an \(m\) exists and
also that \(f(\vec{n},i)\) is defined but not equal to 0 for all \(0
\leq i &lt; m\). On the other hand, \(\mu y f(\vec{n},y)\) is
undefined just in case either there is no \(m\) such that
\(f(\vec{n},m) = 0\) or there is such a \(m\) but \(f(\vec{n},i)\) is
undefined for some \(i &lt; m\).</p>

<p>
Since this definition determines \(\mu yf(\vec{x},y)\) uniquely,
(\ref{murec}) can also be regarded as defining a functional
\(\mathcal{Min}_k\) which maps \(k+1\)-ary partial functions into
\(k\)-ary partial functions. We now define the classes of functions
\(\mathbf{PartREC}\)  and \(\mathbf{REC}\)  as follow:</p>

<div class="indent" id="partrecdef">

<p>
<strong>Definition 2.5:</strong> The class of <em>partial recursive
functions</em> \(\mathbf{PartREC}\) (also known as the <em>\(\mu\)-recursive
functions</em>) is the smallest class of partial functions of type
\(\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) containing the initial
functions \(I_{\mathbf{PR}} = \{\mathbf{0},s,\pi^i_k\}\) and closed
under the functionals</p> 

\[Op_{\mathbf{PartREC}} = \{\mathcal{Comp}^i_j,\mathcal{PrimRec}_k,\mathcal{Min}_k\}.\]

<p>
We say that a function \(f:\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) is
<em>partial recursive</em> if \(f \in \mathbf{PartREC}\). Additionally
we say that \(f\) is <em>recursive</em> if \(f \in \mathbf{PartREC}\)
and \(f\) is total. The set of recursive functions will be denoted by
\(\mathbf{REC}\). </p>
</div>

<p>
Note that despite its name, <em>the class of partial recursive
functions contains total functions</em>. In particular, a
<em>recursive function</em> is, by definition, one which is
<em>partial recursive while also being total</em>. We will see in
 <a href="#NonCompFuncUndeProb">Section 3.2</a>,
 there also exist partial recursive functions which are genuinely partial and
total functions which are not recursive.</p>

<p>
Note finally that if \(f(\vec{x})\) is recursive it may be defined via
some finite number of applications of composition, primitive
recursion, and unbounded minimization in a manner which preserves the
totality of intermediate functions in its definition. Thus although
the specification of \(f(\vec{x})\) may involve one or more
applications of unbounded search, each search required to compute its
value is guaranteed to terminate in a finite number of steps. It thus
follows that all of functions in \(\mathbf{REC}\) are computable by an
algorithm (despite the fact that we will soon see that this class
contains functions which are not primitive recursive). This
constitutes part of the evidence for <em>Church&rsquo;s
Thesis</em>&mdash;i.e., the claim that \(\mathbf{REC}\) coincides with the
class of effectively computable functions&mdash;which was surveyed in
 <a href="#ChurThes">Section 1.6</a>.</p>
 

<h4 id="NormFormTheo">2.2.2 The Normal Form Theorem</h4>

<p>
A question which naturally arises at this stage is whether more than
one application of unbounded minimization is required to obtain all
partial recursive functions. The fact that a single application is
sufficient is a consequence of the <em>Kleene Normal Form
Theorem</em>. In order to formulate this result, it is convenient to
officially extend the application of the \(\mu\)-operator to relations
in the manner discussed at the beginning of this section&mdash;i.e., </p>

\[\begin{align} \label{unboundedminrel}
\mu y R(\vec{x},y) = 
\begin{cases}
\text{the least $y$ such that $R(\vec{x},y)$} &amp; \text{ if such a $y$ exists} \\
\uarrow &amp; \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{align}\]

<div class="indent" id="knft">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 2.3:</strong> For all \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) there
exists a \(k\)+2-ary primitive recursive relation
\(T_k(e,\vec{x},s)\)&mdash;the so-called <em>Kleene
\(T\)-predicate</em>&mdash;and a primitive recursive function \(u(x)\)
(not depending on \(k\)) satisfying the following
condition: for all \(k\)-ary partial recursive functions
\(f(\vec{x})\) there exists \(e \in \mathbb{N}\) such that for all
\(\vec{n} \in \mathbb{N}^k\) </p> 

\[f(\vec{n}) \simeq u(\mu s T_k(e,\vec{n},s))\]

</div>

<p>
Since \(\mu y R(\vec{x},y) \simeq \mu y \chi_{\neg R}(\vec{x},y)\), it
is easy to see that the class \(\mathbf{PartREC}\) can also be obtained by
closing the primitive recursive functions under the operation defined
by (\ref{unboundedminrel}). One consequence of
 <a href="#knft">Theorem 2.3</a>
 is thus that it is indeed possible to define any \(k\)-ary partial
recursive function \(f(\vec{x})\) by a single application of unbounded
search applied to the relation \(T_k(e,\vec{x},s)\) for an appropriate
choice of \(e\). More generally, the Normal Form Theorem illustrates
how any such function may be defined from a <em>single</em> relation
\(T_k(e,\vec{x},s)\) wherein the value of \(e\) serves as a
description of the manner in which \(f(\vec{x})\) is defined in terms
of the basis functions \(I_{\mathbf{PR}}\) and the operations
\(Op_{\mathbf{PartRec}}\). Such an \(e\) is known as an <em>index</em>
for \(f(\vec{x})\). As we will see in
 <a href="#CompTheo">Section 3</a>,
 the availability of such indices is one of the central features of
the partial recursive functions which allows them to provide the basis
for a general theory of computability and non-computability.</p>

<p>
The complete details of the proof of
 <a href="#knft">Theorem 2.3</a>
 are involved. But the basic idea may be summarized as follows:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>

<p>
Every partial recursive function \(f(\vec{x})\) is defined by a term
\(\tau\) over the language </p> 

\[\mathbf{0},s,\pi^i_j,\mathcal{Comp}^j_k,\mathcal{PrimRec}_k,\mathcal{Min}_k\]

<p>
in the manner which extends the notation scheme for partial recursive
function introduced at the end of
 <a href="#Defi">Section 2.1.1</a>.
 By associating the atomic expressions of this language with natural
numbers in the manner of G&ouml;del numbering \(\ulcorner \cdot
\urcorner\) described in
 <a href="#AritReprGodeFirsIncoTheo">Section 1.3</a>
 and then employing the coding machinery described at the end of
 <a href="#Exam">Section 2.1.2</a>,
 it is then possible to associate \(\tau\) with a natural number
\(\ulcorner \tau \urcorner = e\) which can serve as an index for
\(f(\vec{x})\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The definition of \(T_k(e,\vec{n},s)\) can now be constructed by
formalizing the following decision algorithm: </p>

<ol type="i">

<li> on input \(e,\vec{n},s\) construct a term \(\tau\) defining
\(f(\vec{x})\) from \(e\); </li>

<li> understanding \(s\) as a potential code for a sequence of
intermediate computational steps similar to that exemplified by the
calculation (\ref{prcalc2}), check whether the result of carrying out
the computation described by \(\tau\) on input \(\vec{n}\) for
\(\textit{len}(s)\) steps corresponds to \(s\); </li>

<li> if so, accept&mdash;i.e., \(T_k(e,\vec{n},s)\) holds&mdash;and if
not reject&mdash;i.e., \(\neg T_k(e,\vec{n},s)\) holds. </li>
</ol> </li>

<li>

<p>
By performing an unbounded search over codes of computation sequences
in this manner, we achieve the dual purposes of both determining if
the computation described by \(\tau\) on input \(\vec{n}\) halts after
a finite number of steps and, if so, also finding a code \(s\) of a
computation sequence which witnesses this fact. The function \(u(s)\)
can then be defined by formalizing the operation which extracts the
output of the computation from the last step
\((s)_{\textit{len}(s)-1}\) of the sequence encoded by \(s\). In the case that
\(T_k(e,\vec{n},s)\) holds, \(u(s)\) will thus correspond to the value
\(f(\vec{n})\). Since the foregoing steps require only performing
bounded search and checking the local combinatorial properties of
finite sequences, it can additionally be shown that
\(T_k(e,\vec{n},s)\) and \(u(x)\) are primitive recursive.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
The techniques used in this proof can also be used to show that
\(\alpha(x,y)\), the universal \(k\)-ary primitive recursive
evaluation function \(u_k(i,\vec{x})\), and the modified diagonal
function \(\delta(x)\) are all recursive (despite the fact that we
have seen above that they are <em>not</em> primitive recursive). For
instance note that the coding of definitions of \(k\)-ary partial recursive
functions described above also allows us to uniformly enumerate all
primitive recursive functions \(g_0(\vec{x}),g_1(\vec{x}),\ldots\) by
considering the codes of terms not containing \(\mathcal{Min}_k\). We
can define in this manner a primitive recursive function \(r(i)\)
enumerating the indices for these functions such that we can obtain
the universal function for \(k\)-ary primitive recursive function
as \(u_k(i,\vec{x}) = u(\mu s T_1(r(i),\vec{x},s)) = g_i(\vec{x})\).
But note that since \(g_i(\vec{x})\) is always defined,
\(u_1(i,\vec{x})\) is not only partial recursive but also total, and
hence recursive.</p>

<p>
Taking into account the equivalences between models of computation
summarized in
 <a href="#ChurThes">Section 1.6</a>,
 it is also possible to formulate a version of
 <a href="#knft">Theorem 2.3</a>
 for each of the models of computation mentioned there. For instance,
in the case of the Turing Machine model \(\mathbf{T}\), the analogous
version of the Normal Form Theorem can be used to show that there is a
single
 <a href="../turing-machine/index.html#TuriUnivMach"><em>universal Turing machine</em> (see entry on Turing machines)</a>
 \(U\) such that every partial recursive function \(f(\vec{x})\)
corresponds to that computed by \(U(e,\vec{x})\) for some \(e \in
\mathbb{N}\). Complete proofs of this sort were given by Turing (1937, sec.
6) for \(\mathbf{T}\), by Kleene (1936a, sec. 2) for the general recursive
functions \(\mathbf{GR}\) (see also Kleene 1952, sec. 58), by Shoenfield (1967, ch.
7.4) for the class \(\mathbf{F}_{\mathsf{PA}}\) of functions
representable in Peano Arithmetic, and by Cutland (1980, ch. 5) for the
Unlimited Register Machine model \(\mathbf{U}\).</p>

<h2 id="CompTheo">3. Computability Theory</h2>

<p>
Computability Theory is a subfield of contemporary mathematical logic devoted to
the classification of functions and sets of natural numbers in terms
of their absolute and relative computability and
definability-theoretic properties. This subject is closely related in
both origin and content to the study of recursive functions. This is
reflected by the fact that computability theory was known as
<em>recursive function theory</em> (or simply <em>recursion
theory</em>) from the time of its inception in the 1930s until the
late 1990s. It is also reflected in the formulation and proof of the
so-called <em>Recursion Theorem</em> which provides a fundamental link
between recursive definability and the sort of self-referential
constructions which are at the core of many methods in computability
theory (see
 <a href="#RecuTheo">Section 3.4</a>).</p>
 

<p>
For reasons discussed in
 <a href="#EntsUnde">Section 1.7</a>,
 contemporary expositions of computability theory are often presented
in an abstract manner which seeks to minimize reference to the
specific features of a model of computation such as the partial
recursive functions. It is thus useful to stress the following
modifications to the traditional terminology which has been employed
in
 <a href="#HistBack">Sections 1 and 2</a>
 and the more contemporary terminology which will be employed in this
section:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
The expressions <em><strong>computable function</strong></em> and
<em><strong>partial computable function</strong></em> will be used
instead of the traditional terms <em><strong>recursive
function</strong></em> and <em><strong>partial recursive
function</strong></em> as defined in
 <a href="#Defi_1">Section 2.2.1</a>.</p></li>
 
<li>

<p>
The expression <em><strong>computable set</strong></em> will be used
instead of the traditional term <em><strong>recursive
set</strong></em>. Similarly, <em><strong>computably
enumerable</strong></em> (or c.e.) <em><strong>set</strong></em> will
be used instead of the traditional term <em><strong>recursively
enumerable</strong></em> (or r.e.) <em><strong>set</strong></em> (see
 <a href="#CompCompEnumSets">Section 3.3</a>).</p></li>
 </ul>

<p>
The other notational conventions introduced at the beginnings of
 <a href="#PrimRecuFuncPR">Section 2.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#PartRecuFuncPartRecuFuncREC">Section 2.2</a>
 will be retained in this section.</p>

<h3 id="IndeSMNTheoUniv">3.1 Indexation, the <i>s</i>-<i>m</i>-<i>n</i> Theorem, and Universality</h3>

<p>
The first significant result in computability theory was
Kleene&rsquo;s (1936a) proof of the Normal Form Theorem which was
presented in
 <a href="#NormFormTheo">Section 2.2.2</a>.
 As discussed there, the Normal Form Theorem can be understood as
illustrating how it is possible to associate each \(k\)-ary partial
computable function \(f(\vec{x})\) with a natural number \(e\) known
as its <em>index</em> such that \(f(\vec{x}) \simeq \mu
s(T_k(e,\vec{x},s))\). Such an \(e\) can be thought of as a name for a
computer program built up from the basis functions, composition,
primitive recursion, and minimization by which the values
\(f(\vec{x})\) can be computed. This also leads to what is known as an
<em>indexation</em> of \(k\)-ary partial computable functions </p>

\[\phi^k_0(\vec{x}), \phi^k_1(\vec{x}), \phi^k_2(\vec{x}), \ldots, \phi^k_i(\vec{x}), \ldots\]

<p>
where \(\phi^k_i(\vec{x}) \simeq \mu s T_k(i,\vec{x},s)\). Such an
enumeration provides a uniform means of listing off all partial
computable functions in the order of their indices. It should be noted,
however, that each partial computable function has infinitely many
indices. For instance, given a function \(f:\mathbb{N}^k \rightarrow
\mathbb{N}\) computed by \(\phi_e(\vec{x})\), it is possible to define
infinitely many extensionally coincident functions with distinct
indices \(\phi_{e'}(\vec{x}), \phi_{e''}(\vec{x}),
\ldots\)&mdash;e.g., by &ldquo;padding&rdquo; the definition encoded
by \(e\) with terms that successively add and then subtract \(m\) for
each \(m \in \mathbb{N}\). As this yields a definition of an
extensionally equivalent function, it thus follows that infinitely
many of the \(\phi^k_i(\vec{x})\) will correspond to the same function
in extension.</p>

<p>
A result closely related to the Normal Form Theorem is the following
which is conventionally known as the <i>s-m-n</i> Theorem:</p>

<div class="indent" id="snmthm">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.1:</strong> For all \(n,m \in \mathbb{N}\), there is
a primitive recursive function \(s^m_n(i,x_0,\ldots,x_{m-1})\) such
that </p> 

\[\phi^n_{s^m_n(i,x_0,\ldots,x_{m-1})}(y_0,\ldots,y_{n-1}) \simeq \phi^{n+m}_i(x_0,\ldots,x_{m-1},y_0,\ldots,y_{n-1})\]

</div>

<p>
Here the function \(s^m_n(i,\vec{x})\) should be thought of as acting
on an index \(i\) for an \(n+m\)-ary partial computable function
together with values \(\vec{x}\) for the first \(m\) of its arguments.
This function returns an index for another partial computable function
which computes the \(n\)-ary function determined by carrying out
\(\phi^{n+m}_i\) with the first \(m\) of its arguments \(\vec{x}\)
fixed but retaining the next \(n\) variables \(\vec{y}\) as inputs.
Although the formulation of the <i>s-m-n</i> Theorem may at first
appear technical, its use will be illustrated in the proof of
 <a href="#ricethm">Rice&rsquo;s Theorem (3.4)</a>
 and the
 <a href="#recthm">Recursion Theorem (3.5)</a>
 below.</p>

<p>
Another consequence of the Normal Form Theorem is the following:</p>

<div class="indent" id="univthm">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.2:</strong> For every \(k \in \mathbb{N}\), there is
a \(k+1\)-ary partial computable function \(\upsilon^k\) which is
universal in the sense that for all \(k\)-ary partial computable
functions \(f(\vec{x})\), there is an \(i \in \mathbb{N}\) such that
\(\upsilon_k(i,\vec{x}) \simeq f(\vec{x})\).</p>
</div>

<p>
This follows immediately from
 <a href="#knft">Theorem 2.3</a>
 by taking \(\upsilon_k(i,\vec{x}) = u(\mu s T_k(i,\vec{x},s))\) where
\(i\) is such that \(f(\vec{x}) \simeq \phi^k_i(\vec{x})\) in the
enumeration of \(k\)-ary partial computable functions. As
\(\upsilon^k(i,\vec{x})\) can be used to compute the values of all
\(k\)-ary partial computable functions uniformly in their index, it
is conventionally referred to as the \(k\)-ary <em>universal
partial computable function</em>.</p>

<p>
It is useful to observe that while we have just defined such a
function for each \(k\), it is also possible to define a binary function
\(\upsilon(i,x)\) which treats its second argument as a code for a
finite sequence \(x_0,\ldots,x_{k-1}\) and then computes in the same
manner as the \(k\)-ary universal function so that we have
\(\upsilon(i,\langle x_0,\ldots, x_{k-1} \rangle) \simeq
\upsilon^k(i,x_0,\ldots,k_{k-1})\). This provides a means of replacing
the prior enumerations of \(k\)-ary partial computable functions
with a single enumeration of unary functions </p> 

\[\phi_0(x), \phi_1(x), \phi_2(x), \ldots, \phi_i(x), \ldots\]

<p>
where \(\phi_i(\langle x_0,\ldots, x_{k-1} \rangle) \simeq
\upsilon(i,\langle x_0,\ldots, x_{k-1} \rangle) \simeq
\phi^k_i(x_0,\ldots, x_{k-1})\).</p>

<p>
Together with
 <a href="#knft">Theorem 2.3</a>,
 <a href="#snmthm">Theorem 3.1</a> and
 <a href="#univthm">Theorem 3.2</a>
 codify the basic properties of a model of computation which make it
suitable for the development of a general theory of computability. In
 <a href="#FormRecu">Section 2</a>
 such a model has been defined in the form of the partial recursive
functions. But as was discussed briefly at the end of
 <a href="#NormFormTheo">Section 2.2.2</a>,
 versions of these results may also be obtained for the other models
of computation discussed in
 <a href="#ChurThes">Section 1.6</a>.
 This licenses the freer usage of computer-based analogies and other
appeals to Church&rsquo;s Thesis employed in most contemporary
treatments of computability theory which will also be judiciously
employed in the remainder of this entry.</p>

<h3 id="NonCompFuncUndeProb">3.2 Non-Computable Functions and Undecidable Problems</h3>

<p>
Having just seen that there is a universal partial computable function
\(\upsilon(i,x)\), a natural question is whether this function is also
computable (i.e., <em>total</em>). A negative answer is provided
immediately by observing that by using \(\upsilon(i,x)\) we may define
another modified diagonal function \(d(x) = \upsilon(x,x) + 1\) which
is partial computable (since \(\upsilon(i,x)\) is). This in turn
implies that \(d(x) \simeq \phi_j(x)\) for some \(j\). But now note that if
\(\upsilon(i,x)\) were total, then \(d(j)\) would be defined and we
would then have </p> 

\[\begin{align*}
d(j) &amp; = \phi_j(j) \\
&amp; = \upsilon(j,j) + 1 \\
&amp; = \phi_j(j) + 1,
\end{align*}\]

<p>
a contradiction. Comparing this situation with  that described at the beginning of
 <a href="#PartRecuFuncPartRecuFuncREC">Section 2.2</a>
 we can see that the partial computable functions differ from the
primitive recursive functions in admitting a universal function within
the same class but at the same time giving up the requirement that the
functions in the class must be total. In other words, while
\(\upsilon(i,x) \in \mathbf{PartREC}\), the discussion in
 <a href="#NormFormTheo">Section 2.2.2</a>
 shows that \(u_1(i,\vec{x}) \in \mathbf{REC} - \mathbf{PR}\).
</p>

<p>
Since it is easy to see how the minimization operation can
be used to define partial functions, the foregoing observations is
expected. What is more surprising is that there are mathematically
well-defined <em>total</em> functions which are not computable. Building on the discussion of the
<em>Entscheidungsproblem</em> in
 <a href="#EntsUnde">Section 1.7</a>,
 the most famous example of such a function derives from the so-called
 <a href="../turing-machine/index.html#HaltProb"><em>Halting Problem</em> (see entry on Turing machines)</a>
 for the Turing Machine model. This was originally formulated by
Turing (1937) as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Given an indexation of \(T_0, T_1, \ldots\) of Turing machines, does
machine \(T_i\) halt on the input \(n\)?</p>
</div>

<p>
An equivalent question can also be formulated in terms of the partial
recursive functions:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
Is the partial computable function \(\phi_i(x)\) defined for input
\(n\)?</p>
</div>

<p>
The pairs of natural numbers \(\langle i,n \rangle\) corresponding to
positive answers to this question determine a subset of \(\mathbb{N}
\times \mathbb{N}\) as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
 \HP = \{\langle i,n \rangle : \phi_i(n) \darrow\} \end{aligned}\]

<p>
A set (or <em>problem</em>) is said to be <em>undecidable</em>
just in case its characteristic function is not computable. For
instance let \(h(x,y) = \chi_{\HP}(x,y)\) and observe that this, by
definition, is a <em>total function</em>. The so-called
<em>undecidability of the Halting Problem</em> may now be formulated
as follows:</p>

<div class="indent" id="hpundec">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.3:</strong> \(h(x,y)\) is not a computable
function.</p>
</div>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Proof:</em> Suppose for a contradiction that \(h(x,y)\) were
computable. Consider the function \(g(x)\) defined as </p>

\[\begin{aligned}
g(x) = \begin{cases} 
0 &amp; \text{if } h(x,x) \darrow = 0 \\
\uarrow &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{aligned}\]

<p>
On the assumption that \(h(x,y)\) is computable, \(g(x)\) is partial
computable since, e.g., it may be computed by a program which on input
\(x\) computes \(h(x,x)\) and returns 0 just in case \(h(x,x) = 0\)
and otherwise goes into an infinite loop. It hence follows that \(g(x)
\simeq \phi_j(x)\) for some \(j \in \mathbb{N}\). But now observe that one
of the following two alternatives must hold: i) \(g(j) \darrow\);
or ii) \(g(j)\uarrow\). We may thus reason by cases as follows:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
Suppose that \(g(j) \darrow\). Then \(h(j,j) = 0\) by definition of
\(g(x)\). Since \(h(i,x)\) is the characteristic function of
\(\HP\), this means \(\phi_j(j) \uarrow\). But then since \(g(x)
\simeq \phi_j(x)\), \(g(j) \uarrow\), a contradiction.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Suppose that \(g(j) \uarrow\). Then \(h(j,j) \neq 0\) by definition
of \(g(x)\). Since \(h(x,y)\) is the characteristic function of
\(\HP\) (and hence total), the only other possibility is that \(h(j,j)
= 1\) which in turn implies that \(\phi_j(j) \darrow\). But then
since \(g(x) \simeq \phi_j(x)\), \(g(j) \darrow\), a contradiction.
&#9633; </p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
\(h(x,y)\) thus provides an initial example of a mathematically
well-defined total function which is not computable. Other
non-computable functions can be defined by considering decision
problems similar to \(\HP\). Some well-known examples are as follows:
</p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{undecexs}
K &amp; = \{i : \phi_i(i) \darrow\} \\ 
 Z &amp;= \{i : \phi_i(n)\darrow = 0 \text{ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$}\} \nonumber \\
 \TOT &amp; = \{i : \phi_i(n) \darrow \text{ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$}\}  \nonumber \\
\textit{FIN}  &amp; = \{i : \phi_i(n)\darrow \text{ for at most
finitely many distinct} \text{$n \in \mathbb{N}$}\}\nonumber\\
&amp;  = \{i : W_i \text{ is finite} \}   \nonumber 
\end{align}\]

<p>
Suppose we let \(k(x), z(x), \textit{tot}(x)\), and
\(\textit{fin}(x)\) be the characteristic functions of these sets. By
making suitable modifications to the proof of
 <a href="#hpundec">Theorem 3.3</a>
 it is possible to directly show the following:</p>

<div class="indent" id="kuncomp">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.1:</strong> None of the functions \(k(x), z(x),
\textit{tot}(x)\), and \(\textit{fin}(x)\) are computable. </p>
</div>

<p>
For instance in the case of \(k(x)\), we may argue as follows:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li> define a function \(g(x)\) which returns 0 if \(k(x) = 0\) and
which is undefined otherwise; </li>

<li> as before, if \(k(x)\) is assumed to be computable, then \(g(x)\)
is partial computable and there is hence an index \(j\) such that
\(g(x) \simeq \phi_j(x)\); </li>

<li> but now observe that \(k(j) = 1\) iff \(g(j) \uarrow\) iff
\(\phi_j(j) \uarrow\) iff \(k(j) = 0\). </li>
</ol>

<p>
As this is again a contradictory situation, we may conclude that
\(k(x)\) is not computable.</p>

<p>
Note that each of the sets \(I\) defined in (\ref{undecexs}) has
the following property: if \(j \in I\) and \(\phi_j(x) \simeq
\phi_k(x)\), then \(k \in I\) as well. Sets with this property are
known as <em>index sets</em> as they collect together the indices of
all partial computable functions which share a common
&ldquo;semantic&rdquo; property&mdash;i.e., one which is completely
determined by their graphs such as being coincident with the constant
0 function in the case of \(Z\) or being defined on all inputs in the
case of \(\TOT\). An index set \(I\) is called <em>non-trivial</em>
if \(I \neq \emptyset\) or \(I \neq \mathbb{N}\)&mdash;i.e., it fails
to either include or exclude all indices. It is easy to see that all
of the sets defined in (\ref{undecexs}) are non-trivial index sets.
The undecidability of these sets thus follows from the following
more general result:</p>

<div class="indent" id="ricethm">

<strong>Theorem 3.4</strong> (Rice 1953): If \(I\) is a non-trivial
index set, then \(I\) is undecidable.</p>
</div>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Proof:</em> Let \(I\) be a non-trivial index set and suppose
for a contradiction that \(\chi_I(x)\) is computable. Consider the
everywhere undefined unary function \(u(x)\)&mdash;i.e., \(u(n)
\uarrow\) for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). Since \(u(x)\) is partial
computable, there is an index \(b\) such that \(\phi_b(x) \simeq
u(x)\). We may suppose without loss of generality that \(b \not\in
I\). (If it is the case that \(b \in I \neq \mathbb{N}\), then we can
switch the role of \(I\) with its complement \(\overline{I}\) in
the following argument and obtain the same result). Since \(I \neq
\emptyset\), we can also choose an index \(a \in I\) and define a
function as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
 f(x,y) = \begin{cases} 
\phi_a(y) &amp; \text{if } k(x) = 1 \ \ \ \text{(i.e., if $\phi_x(x) \darrow$)} \\
\uarrow &amp; \text{if } k(x) = 0 \ \ \ \text{(i.e., if $\phi_x(x) \uarrow$)} 
\end{cases} \nonumber\end{aligned}\]

<p>
Note that \(f(x,y)\) is partial computable since it is defined by
cases in terms of \(\phi_a(x)\) based on the value of \(\phi_x(x)\).
There is thus an index \(c\) such that \(f(x,y) \simeq \phi_c(x,y)\).
By applying the
 <a href="#snmthm"><i>s-m-n</i> Theorem (3.1)</a>,
 we thus have that \(\phi_c(x,y) \simeq \phi_{s^2_1(c,x)}(y)\). But
note that we now have the following sequences of implications:</p>

<div class="indent">

\[\begin{align*}
k(x) = 1 &amp; \Rightarrow f(x,y)  \simeq \phi_a(y) \\
&amp; \Rightarrow \phi_{s^2_1(c,x)}(y)  \simeq \phi_a(y)\\
&amp;  \Rightarrow s^2_1(c,x) \in I  
\end{align*}
\]

<p>
(by our choice of \(a \in I\))</p> 

\[\begin{align*}
k(x) = 0 &amp; \Rightarrow f(x,y) \simeq \phi_b(y) \\
&amp; \Rightarrow \phi_{s^2_1(c,x)}(y) \simeq \phi_b(y) \\
&amp; \Rightarrow s^2_1(c,x) \not\in I
\end{align*}\]

<p>
(by our assumptions that \(b\) is an index for \(u(x)\)&mdash;the
everywhere undefined function&mdash;and that \(b \not\in I\)).
</p>
</div>

<p>
It hence follows that the value of \(k(x)\) may be computed by
applying the following algorithm: </p>

<ol type="i">

<li> on input \(x\), calculate the value of \(s^2_1(c,x)\) (whose
computability follows from the <i>s-m-n</i> Theorem); </li>

<li> calculate the value of \(\chi_I(s^2_1(c,x))\) (which may be
accomplished since we have assumed that \(\chi_I(x)\) is computable).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Either by invoking Church&rsquo;s Thesis or by formalizing the prior
algorithm as a partial recursive definition, it follows that \(k(x)\)
is computable. But this contradicts
 <a href="#kuncomp">Proposition 3.1</a>
 which shows that \(k(x)\) is not computable.
&#9633;</p></div>

<p>

 <a href="#ricethm">Rice&rsquo;s Theorem (3.4)</a>
 provides a means of showing that many decision problems of practical
import are undecidable&mdash;e.g., of determining whether a program
always returns an output or whether it correctly computes a given
function (e.g., addition or multiplication). Its proof also shows that
if \(I\) is a non-trivial index set, the problem of deciding \(x
\in K\) can be &ldquo;reduced&rdquo; to that of deciding \(x \in I\)
it the following sense: <em>if</em> we could effectively decide the
latter, <em>then</em> we could also effectively decide the former by
first calculating \(s^2_1(c,x)\) and then checking if this value is in
\(I\). This method of showing undecidability will be formalized by
the notion of a <em>many-one reduction</em> described in
 <a href="#ReduDegr">Section 3.5</a>
 below.</p>

<h3 id="CompCompEnumSets">3.3 Computable and Computably Enumerable Sets</h3>

<p>
A set \(A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\) is said to be <em>computable</em> (or
<em>recursive</em> according to the older terminology of
 <a href="#FormRecu">Section 2</a>)
 just in case its characteristic function is. More generally we have
the following:</p>

<div class="Indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.1:</strong> A relation \(R \subseteq
\mathbb{N}^k\) is <em>computable</em> just in case \(\chi_R(\vec{x})\)
is computable.</p>
</div>

<p>
This definition extends the definition of a primitive recursive
relation given in
 <a href="#PrimRecuFuncPR">Section 2.1</a>&mdash;e.g.,
 since sets like <em>PRIMES</em> and <em>DIV</em> are primitive
recursive they are <em>ipso facto</em> computable. Via Church&rsquo;s
Thesis, the notion of a computable set thus also generalizes the
accompanying heuristic about effective decidability&mdash;i.e., \(R\)
is computable just in case there is an algorithm for deciding if
\(R(\vec{n})\) holds which always returns an answer after a finite
(although potentially unbounded) number of steps. On the other hand,
it follows from the observations recorded in
 <a href="#NonCompFuncUndeProb">Section 3.2</a>
 that none of <em>HP</em>, <em>K</em>, <em>Z</em>, <em>TOT</em>, or
<em>FIN</em> are computable sets.</p>

<p>
A related definition is that of a <em>computably enumerable</em> (or
<em>c.e.</em>) <em>set</em>&mdash;i.e., one whose members can be
enumerated by an effective procedure. (In the older terminology of
 <a href="#FormRecu">Section 2</a>
 such a set is said to be <em>recursively enumerable</em> which is traditionally abbreviated <em>r.e.</em>) Officially we have the
following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.2:</strong> \(A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\) is
<em>computably enumerable</em> (or c.e.) if \(A = \emptyset\) or \(A\)
is the range of a computable function&mdash;i.e.,</p> 

 \[A = \{m : \phi_e(n)\darrow = m \text{ for some } n \in \mathbb{N}\}\] 

<p>
for some index \(e\) of a total computable function.</p>
</div>

<p>
This definition can be extended to relations by viewing \(m\) as a
code for a finite sequence in the obvious way&mdash;i.e., \(R
\subseteq \mathbb{N}^k\) is c.e.&nbsp;just in case there is a
computable function \(\phi_e(x)\) such that \(R(n_0, \ldots, n_k)\) if
and only if \(\phi_e(n) = \langle n_0, \ldots, n_k \rangle\) for some
\(n \in \mathbb{N}\).</p>

<p>
If \(A\) is computably enumerable, its members may thus be listed off
as </p> 

\[A = \{\phi_e(0), \phi_e(1), \phi_e(2), \ldots \}\]

<p>
possibly with repetitions&mdash;e.g., the constant function
\(\const_{17}(x)\) enumerates the singleton set \(\{17\}\), which is
thereby c.e. It is easy to see that a computable set \(A\) is
computably enumerable. For if \(A = \emptyset\), then \(A\) is
c.e.&nbsp;by definition. And if \(A \neq \emptyset\), we may choose
\(a \in A\) and then define </p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{cefromc}
f(x) = \begin{cases} 
     x &amp; \text{if } \chi_A(x) = 1 \\ 
     a &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}
\end{align}\]

<p>
In this case \(f(x)\) is computable and has \(A\) as its range.</p>

<p>
In proving facts about computably enumerable sets, it is often
convenient to employ one of several equivalent definitions:</p>

<div class="indent" id="ceequivdefs">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.2:</strong> Suppose \(A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\).
Then the following are equivalent:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
\(A\) is computably enumerable.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(A = \emptyset\) or \(A\) is the range of a primitive recursive
function.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(A = \{n \in \mathbb{N}: \exists y R(n,y)\}\) for a computable
relation \(R\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(A\) is the domain of a partial computable function.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
The proof of
 <a href="#ceequivdefs">Proposition 3.2</a>
 is largely a matter of unpacking definitions. For instance, to see
that iv implies i, suppose that \(A =
\textrm{dom}(\phi_e)\)&mdash;i.e., \(A = \{n \in \mathbb{N} :
\phi_e(n) \darrow\}\). If \(A = \emptyset\) it is automatically
c.e. Otherwise, there is an element \(a \in A\). We may now define
</p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
f(x) = \begin{cases} (x)_0 &amp; \text{if } T_1(e,(x)_0,(x)_1) \\ a &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\end{aligned}\]

<p>
\(f(x)\) thus treats its input as a pair \(\langle n,s \rangle\)
consisting of an input \(n\) to \(\phi_e(x)\) and a computation
sequence \(s\) as defined in the proof of the Normal Form Theorem
 (<a href="#knft">2.3</a>).
 As \(x\) varies over \(\mathbb{N}\), it thus steps through all
possible inputs \((x)_0\) to \(\phi_e\) and also all possible
witnesses \((x)_1\) to the fact that the computation of \(\phi_e\) on
\((x)_0\) halts. It then returns \((x)_0\) if \((x)_1\) is such a
witness to a halting computation and \(a\) otherwise. Thus the range
of \(f(x)\) will correspond to that of \(\phi_e(x)\). And as
\(T_1(e,x,s)\) is computable (and in fact primitive recursive)
relation, it is easy to see that \(f(x)\) is a computable function
with range \(A\). This shows that \(A\) is c.e.&nbsp;as desired.</p>

<p>
Part iv of
 <a href="#ceequivdefs">Proposition 3.2</a>
 also provides a convenient uniform notation for computably enumerable
sets&mdash;i.e., if \(A = \textrm{dom}(\phi_e)\) we denote \(A\) by
\(W_e = \{n : \phi_e(n) \darrow\}\). The sequence \(W_0,W_1, W_2,
\ldots\) thus provides a uniform enumeration of c.e.&nbsp;sets
relative to our prior enumeration of unary partial computable
functions. This notation also aids the formulation of the
following:</p>

<div class="indent" id="closeprops">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.3:</strong></p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
The computably enumerable sets are effectively closed under union,
intersection, and cross product&mdash;i.e., there are computable
functions \(\textit{un}(x,y),\) \(\textit{int}(x,y)\) and
\(\textit{cr}(x,y)\) such that if \(A = W_i\) and \(B = W_j\) then</p>

 \[A \cup B = W_{\textit{un}(i,j)}, A \cap B = W_{\textit{int}(i,j)}\]

<p>
and</p> 

 \[\{\langle x,y \rangle : x \in A \ \&amp; \ y \in B\} = W_{\textit{cr}(i,j)}.\]</li>

<li>

<p>
The computable sets are additionally closed under complementation and
relative complementation&mdash;i.e., if \(A\) and \(B\) are recursive,
then so are \(\overline{A}\) and \(A - B\).</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
The proofs of these facts are also straightforward upon appeal to
Church&rsquo;s Thesis. For instance, if \(\textrm{dom}(\phi_i) = A\)
and \(\textrm{dom}(\phi_j) = B\) then \(\textit{un}(i,j)\) can be
taken to be an index for a program which simulates the computation of
\(\phi_i(n)\) and \(\phi_j(n)\) in alternate stages and halts just in
case one of these subcomputations halt. Note also that if \(A = W_i\)
is computable, then \(\chi_{\overline{A}}(x) = 1 \dotminus \chi_A(x)\)
is also computable, from which it follows that \(\overline{A}\) is
 computable.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
A related observation is the following:</p>

<div class="indent" id="postthm">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.4</strong> (Post 1944): \(A\) is computable if
and only if \(A\) and \(\overline{A}\) are both computably
enumerable.</p>
</div>

<p>
The left-to-right direction is subsumed under
 <a href="#closeprops">Proposition 3.3</a>.
 For the right-to-left direction, suppose that \(A =
\textrm{dom}(\phi_i)\) and \(\overline{A} = \textrm{dom}(\phi_j)\).
Then to decide \(n \in A\) we can perform an unbounded search for a
computation sequence \(s\) such that either \(T_1(i,n,s)\) or
\(T_1(j,n,s)\), accepting in the first case and rejecting in the
second. Since \(A \cup \overline{A} = \mathbb{N}\), the search must
always terminate and since \(A \cap \overline{A} = \emptyset\), the
conditions are exclusive. Thus by again appealing to Church&rsquo;s
Thesis, \(A\) is computable.</p>

<p>
We have seen that the computable sets are contained in the computably
enumerable sets. Two questions which arise at this stage are as
follows:</p>

<ol>

<li> are there examples of sets which are computably enumerable but
not computable? </li>

<li>are there are examples of sets which are not computably
enumerable? </li>
</ol>

<p>
A positive answer to both is provided by the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Corollary 3.1:</strong> Recall the set \(K = \{i : \phi_i(i)
\darrow\}\)&mdash;i.e., the so called <em>Diagonal Halting
Problem</em>. \(K\) is computably enumerable but not computable while
\(\overline{K}\) is not computably enumerable.</p>
</div>

<p>
\(K\) is clearly c.e.&nbsp;as it is the domain of \(\mu s
T_1(x,x,s)\). On the other hand, we have seen that the characteristic
function of \(K\)&mdash;i.e., the function \(\chi_K(x) = k(x)\) as
defined in
 <a href="#NonCompFuncUndeProb">Section 3.2</a>&mdash;is
 not computable. Thus \(K\) is indeed a computably enumerable set
which is not computable. To see that \(\overline{K}\) is not c.e.,
observe that if it were, then \(K\) would be computable by
 <a href="#postthm">Proposition 3.4</a>.
 This in turn suggests a sense in which it is &ldquo;harder&rdquo; to
decide membership in \(K\) than in any computable set. The
hierarchies introduced in
 <a href="#ReduDegr">Sections 3.5</a>
 and
 <a href="#AritAnalHier">Section 3.6</a>
 will provide a means of making such observations precise.</p>

<h3 id="RecuTheo">3.4 The Recursion Theorem</h3>

<p>
The result which is now most often referred to as <em>Kleene&rsquo;s
Recursion Theorem</em> can be used to unify a number of effective
diagonal arguments similar to that underlying
 <a href="#hpundec">Theorem 3.3</a>
 and has a wide range of applications both in computability theory and
other areas of mathematical logic and computer
 science.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>
 Although its statement is straightforward, both its significance and
the following proof become clearer upon considering subsequent
applications.</p>

<div class="indent" id="recthm">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.5</strong> (Kleene 1938): Suppose that \(f(x)\) is a
total computable function. Then there is a number \(n \in \mathbb{N}\)
such that \(\phi_n(y) \simeq \phi_{f(n)}(y)\).</p>
</div>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Proof:</em> Consider the function \(g(x,y)\) defined as follows:
</p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
g(x,y) = \begin{cases} \phi_{\phi_x(x)}(y) &amp; \text{if } \phi_x(x) \darrow \\ \uarrow &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \end{aligned}\]

<p>
As it is evident that \(g(x,y)\) is partial computable, \(g(x,y)
\simeq \phi_e(x,y)\) for some \(e\). It thus follows by the
 <a href="#snmthm"><i>s-m-n</i> Theorem (3.1)</a>
 that \(\phi_e(x,y) \simeq \phi_{s^2_1(e,x)}(y)\). Let \(b(x) =
s^2_1(e,x)\) and note that we then have \(\phi_{b(x)}(y)\) is the same
function as \(\phi_{\phi_x(x)}(y)\) provided that \(\phi_x(x)\) is
defined. Note that \(b(x)\) is a total computable function and is
defined independently of the given function \(f(x)\).</p>

<p>
Next let \(k\) be an index for the composition of \(f(x)\) with
\(b(x)\)&mdash;i.e., \(\phi_k(x) \simeq f(b(x))\). We now claim that
\(n = b(k)\) is the number called for in the statement of the theorem.
For first note that since \(b(x)\) and \(f(x)\) are both total,
\(\phi_k(x)\) is also total and thus \(\phi_k(k)\) is defined. From
this it follows that \(\phi_{b(k)}(y) \simeq \phi_{\phi_k(k)}(y)\). We
now have the following sequence of functional identities: </p>

\[\phi_n(y) \simeq \phi_{b(k)}(y) \simeq  \phi_{\phi_k(k)}(y) \simeq \phi_{f(b(k))}(y) \simeq \phi_{f(n)}(y)\]

<p>
&#9633;</p>
</div>

<p>
The Recursion Theorem is sometimes also referred to as the <em>Fixed
Point Theorem</em>. Note, however, that
 <a href="#recthm">Theorem 3.5</a>
 does not guarantee the existence of an extensional fixed point for
the given function \(f(x)\)&mdash;i.e., a number \(n\) such that
\(f(n) = n\). (In fact it is evident that there are computable
functions for which no such value exists&mdash;e.g., \(f(x) = x+1\).)
But suppose we view \(f(x)\) instead as a mapping on indices to
partial computable functions or, more figuratively, as a means of
transforming a <em>program</em> for computing a partial computable
function into another program. On this interpretation, the theorem expresses
that for every such computable transformation there is some program
\(n\) such that the function \(\phi_n(y)\) which it computes is the
same as the function \(\phi_{f(n)}(y)\) computed by its image \(f(n)\)
under the transformation.</p>

<p>
As it may at first appear such an \(n\) is defined in a circular
manner, it is also <em>prima facie</em> unclear why such a program
must exist. Indeed Soare (2016, 28&ndash;29) remarks that the
foregoing proof of the Recursion Theorem is &ldquo;very short but
mysterious&rdquo; and is &ldquo;best visualized as a diagonal argument
that fails&rdquo;. In order to clarify both this comment and the
proof, consider the matrix depicted in Figure 1 whose rows \(R_i\)
enumerate not the values of partial computable functions but rather the
functions themselves&mdash;i.e., the row \(R_i\) will contain the
functions \(\phi_{\phi_i(0)}, \phi_{\phi_i(1)}, \ldots\) with the
understanding that if \(\phi_i(j) \uarrow\), then
\(\phi_{\phi_i(j)}\) denotes the totally undefined function. (Such a
depiction is originally due to Owings 1973.)</p>

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1:</span> The matrix of partial
computable functions employed in the proof of the
 <a href="#recthm"> Recursion Theorem (3.5)</a>
 </p>
</div>

<p>
We may think of the function \(f(x)\) given in
 <a href="#recthm">Theorem 3.5</a>
 as inducing a transformation on the rows so that \(R_i\) is mapped to
\(R_{f(i)}\). To this end, let \(h_f(x)\) be an index to the total
computable function which composes \(f\) with \(\phi_x\) so that we
have </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\phi_{h_f(x)}(y) \simeq f(\phi_x(y))\end{aligned}\]

<p>
Next consider the diagonal of this matrix&mdash;i.e., \(D =
\phi_{\phi_0(0)}, \phi_{\phi_1(1)}, \ldots\) Since the indices to the
functions which comprise \(D\) are given effectively, it must be the
case that \(D\) itself corresponds to some row \(R_d\)&mdash;i.e.,
</p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{dr} 
\phi_{\phi_d(i)}(y) \simeq \phi_{\phi_i(i)}(y) \text{ for all } i \in \mathbb{N}
\end{align}\]

<p>
But now consider the image of \(R_d\) under \(f\)&mdash;i.e., the row
\(R_{h_f(d)} = \phi_{\phi_{h_f(d)}(0)}, \phi_{\phi_{h_f(d)}(1)},
\ldots\) It follows from (\ref{dr}) that we must have </p>

\[\begin{equation} \label{lastrecthm1}
\phi_{\phi_d(h_f(d))}(y) \simeq  \phi_{\phi_{h_f(d)}(h_f(d))}(y)
\end{equation}\]

<p>
But note that by the definition of \(h_f\), \(\phi_{h_f(d)}(h_f(d)) =
f(\phi_d(h_f(d))\) and thus also from (\ref{lastrecthm1}) </p>

\[\begin{equation} \label{lastrecthm2}
\phi_{\phi_d(h_f(d))}(y) \simeq  \phi_{f(\phi_d(h_f(d))}(y)
\end{equation}\]

<p>
But now note that since \(f,\phi_d\) and \(h_f\) are all total, the
value \(\phi_d(h_f(d))\) is defined. Thus setting \(n =
\phi_d(h_f(d))\) it follows from (\ref{lastrecthm2}) that \(\phi_n(y)
\simeq \phi_{f(n)}(y)\) as desired.</p>

<p>
As mentioned above, the Recursion Theorem may often be used to present
compact proofs of results which would traditionally be described as
involving <em>self-reference</em>. For instance, an immediate
consequence is that for every \(f(x)\) there is an \(n\) such that
\(W_n = W_{f(n)}\). To see this note that
 <a href="#recthm">Theorem 3.5</a>
 entails the existence of such an \(n\) such that \(\phi_n(x)
\simeq \phi_{f(n)}\) for every computable \(f(x)\). But since the
domains of the functions must then coincide, it follows that \(W_n =
W_{f(n)}\).</p>

<p>
It is useful to record the following alternative form of the Recursion
Theorem:</p>

<div class="indent" id="recthmcor">

<p>
<strong>Corollary 3.2:</strong> For every partial computable function
\(f(x,y)\), there is an index \(n\) such that \(\phi_n(y) \simeq
f(n,y)\).</p>
</div>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>Proof:</em> By the
 <a href="#snmthm"><i>s-m-n</i> Theorem (3.1)</a>,
 \(f(x,y) \simeq \phi_{s^2_1(i,x)}(y)\) for some \(i\). But then the
existence of the required \(n\) follows by applying
 <a href="#recthm">Theorem 3.5</a>
 to \(s^2_1(i,x)\). &#9633;</p>
</div>

<p>
Here are some easy consequences in the spirit described above which
make use of this formulation:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
There is a number \(n\) such that \(\phi_n(x) = x + n\). (This

 Analogous observations yield the existence of \(n\) such that
\(\phi_n(x) = x \times n, \phi_n(x) = x^n\), etc.)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
There is a number \(n\) such that \(W_n = \{n\}\). (Take </p>

\[f(x,y) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \text{if } x = y \\ \uarrow &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]

Consider a term \(\tau\) corresponding to a &ldquo;program&rdquo;
which determines the partial computable program with index \(\ulcorner
\tau \urcorner\) (as described in
 <a href="#NormFormTheo">Section 2.2.2</a>).
 We say that such a program is <em>self-reproducing</em> if for all
inputs \(x\), the computation of \(\tau\) on \(x\) outputs \(\ulcorner
\tau \urcorner\). Since in order to construct \(\tau\) it would seem
that we need to know \(\ulcorner \tau \urcorner\) in advance, it might
appear that self-reproducing programs need not exist. Note, however,
that transposed back into our official terminology, the existence of
such a program is equivalent to the existence of a number \(n\) such that
\(\phi_n(x) = n\). And this is guaranteed by applying
 <a href="#recthmcor">Corollary 3.2</a>
 to the function \(f(x,y) = x\).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
For further discussions of the Recursion Theorem in regard to
self-reference and more advanced applications in computability theory
see, e.g., Cutland (1980, ch. 11), Rogers (1987, ch. 11), Odifreddi (1989, ch.
II.2), and Y. Moschovakis (2010).</p>

<p>
Before leaving the Recursion Theorem, it will finally be useful to reflect on how it bears on the general concept of recursive definability as discussed in <a href="#HistBack">Sections 1 and 2</a>.   Consider, for instance, a simple definition such as
 </p> 

\[\begin{align} \label{recex}
h(0) &amp; = k \\ \nonumber
h(y+1) &amp; = g(h(y))
\end{align}\]

<p>
In the case that \(f(y)\) and \(g(y)\) are primitive recursive, we
have remarked that it is possible to show that there exists a unique
function \(h(y)\) satisfying (\ref{recex}) by an external
set-theoretic argument. But we may also consider the case in which
\(g(y)\) is assumed to be computable relative to a model of
computation \(\mathbf{M}\) which differs from the partial recursive
functions in that it does not natively support recursion as a mode of
computation&mdash;e.g., the Turing Machine model \(\mathbf{T}\) or
Unlimited Register Machine model \(\mathbf{U}\). If we simply set down
(\ref{recex}) as a definition in this case, we would have no <em>a
priori</em> assurance that \(h(y)\) is computable relative to
\(\mathbf{M}\) even if \(g(x)\) is.</p>

<p>
Upon examination, however, it is clear that the only features of a
model of computation on which the proof of
 <a href="#recthm">Theorem 3.5</a>
 relies are the existence of an indexation for which a version of the
 <a href="#snmthm"><i>s-m-n</i> Theorem (3.1)</a>
 is available. If \(\mathbf{M}\) satisfies these conditions, the claim
that \(h(y)\) is computable relative to \(\mathbf{M}\) is equivalent
to \(h(y) \simeq \phi_n(y)\) where \(n\) is an index drawn from some suitable indexation of
the \(\mathbf{M}\)-computable functions. But since the <i>s-m-n</i>
Theorem for \(\mathbf{M}\) allows us to treat an index as a variable,
we can also consider the function defined by </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
f(x,0) &amp; = k \\ \nonumber
f(x,y+1) &amp; = g(\phi_x(y))\end{aligned}\]

<p>
Now note that the existence of an \(n\) such that \(f(n,y) \simeq
\phi_n(y)\) is again guaranteed by
 <a href="#recthmcor">Corollary 3.2</a>.
 This in turn yields </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\phi_n(0) &amp; = k \\ \nonumber
\phi_n(y+1) &amp; = g(\phi_n(y))\end{aligned}\]

<p>
This illustrates how the existence of a computable function satisfying
a recursive definition such as (\ref{recex}) follows from the
Recursion Theorem even if we have not started out by characterizing a
&ldquo;computable function&rdquo; as one defined
&ldquo;recursively&rdquo; in the informal sense discussed in
 <a href="#HistBack">Section 1</a>.
 And this in turn helps to explain why
 <a href="#recthm">Theorem 3.5</a>
 has come to be known as the <em>Recursion</em> Theorem.</p>

<h3 id="ReduDegr">3.5 Reducibilities and Degrees</h3>

<p>
A central topic in contemporary computability theory is the study of
<em>relative computability</em>&mdash;i.e., if we <em>assume</em> that
we are able to decide membership in a given set or compute a given
function, which other sets or functions would we be able to decide or
compute? This question may be studied using the notion of a
<em>reduction</em> of one set \(A\) to another \(B\) which was
introduced informally by Kolmogorov (1932) as a means of transforming
a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; of \(A\) into a &ldquo;solution&rdquo; of
 \(B\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup>
 Turing (1939) provided the first formal definition of a computational
reduction in his study of ordinal logics. However, it was Post who
first proposed to systematically study reducibility notions and their
associated degree structures in his highly influential paper
&ldquo;Recursively enumerable sets of positive integers and their
decision problems&rdquo; (1944).</p>

<p>
Therein Post explains the basic idea of a reduction and its
significance as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Related to the question of solvability or unsolvability of problems is
that of the reducibility or non-reducibility of one problem to
another. Thus, if problem \(P_1\) has been reduced to problem \(P_2\),
a solution of \(P_2\) immediately yields a solution of \(P_1\), while
if \(P_1\) is proved to be unsolvable, \(P_2\) must also be
unsolvable. For unsolvable problems the concept of reducibility leads
to the concept of degree of unsolvability, two unsolvable problems
being of the same <em>degree of unsolvability</em> if each is
reducible to the other, one of lower degree of unsolvability than
another if it is reducible to the other, but that other is not
reducible to it, of incomparable degrees of unsolvability if neither
is reducible to the other. A primary problem in the theory of
recursively enumerable sets is the problem of determining the degrees
of unsolvability of the unsolvable decision problems thereof. We shall
early see that for such problems there is certainly a highest degree
of unsolvability. Our whole development largely centers on the single
question of whether there is, among these problems, a lower degree of
unsolvability than that, or whether they are all of the same degree of
unsolvability. (Post 1944, 289)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In order to appreciate this passage, it is again useful to think of a
set \(A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\) as being associated with the
<em>problem</em> of deciding membership in \(A\)&mdash;e.g., given a
natural number \(n\), is \(n\) prime? (i.e., \(n \in
\textit{PRIMES}\)?) or is the \(n\)th partial computable function
with input \(n\) defined? (i.e., \(n \in K\)?). But even given this
correspondence, the assertion that a solution to a problem \(B\)
&ldquo;immediately yields&rdquo; a solution to \(A\) may still be
analyzed in a number of different ways. Two of the most important
possibilities are as follows:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
Assuming that there is an algorithm for deciding questions of the form
\(n \in B\), then it is possible to specify an algorithm for deciding
questions of the form \(n \in A\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Assuming that we had access to an &ldquo;<em>oracle</em>&rdquo;
capable of answering arbitrary questions of the form \(n \in B\) in a
single step, then it is possible to specify an algorithm employing the
oracle for deciding \(n \in A\).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
The formalization of these relations between problems leads to the
notions of <em>many-one reducibility</em> and <em>Turing
reducibility</em> which provide distinct but complementary analyses of
the notions \(A\) <em>is no harder to solve than</em> \(B\) and also
<em>the degree of unsolvability</em> (or <em>difficulty</em>) <em>of
\(A\) is equal to that of
 \(B\)</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>
 The latter notion came first historically and was introduced by
Turing (1939) and in an equivalent form by Kleene (1943). However it
was Post (1944) who both introduced the former notion and also
initiated the general study of Turing reducibility. In fact the final
sentence of the passage quoted above describes an important technical
question about the Turing degrees which would shape the early
development of computability theory (i.e., &ldquo;Post&rsquo;s
problem&rdquo; given as
 <a href="#postprob">Question 3.1</a>
 below).</p>

<h4 id="ManyOneDegr">3.5.1 The many-one degrees</h4>

<p>
We have already seen an example of many-one reducibility in the proof
of
 <a href="#ricethm">Rice&rsquo;s Theorem (3.4)</a>.
 In particular, the proof showed that the problem of deciding
membership in \(K\) can be reduced to that of deciding membership
in any non-trivial index set \(I\) in the following sense: for all
\(n\), if \(n \in K\) then \(s^2_1(c,n) \in I\). Thus if there were
an algorithm for deciding membership in \(I\), we would be able to
decide whether \(n \in K\) by using it to test whether \(s^2_1(c,n)
\in I\). The function \(s^2_1(c,x)\) (whose computability is given by
the <i>s-m-n</i> Theorem) is thus a so-called <em>many-one</em>
reduction of \(K\) to \(I\).</p>

<p>
The formal definition generalizes this example as follows:</p>

<div class="indent" id="mred">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.3:</strong> Given sets \(A, B \subseteq
\mathbb{N}\), \(A\) is said to be <em>many-one</em> (or \(m\)-one)
<em>reducible</em> to \(B\) if there is a computable function \(f(x)\)
such that for all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), </p> 

\[n \in A \text{ in and only if } f(n) \in B\]

<p>
In this case we write \(A \leq_m B\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Using this notation, the foregoing example thus shows that \(K \leq_m
I\). These observations can generalized as follows:</p>

<div class="indent" id="redthm">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.5:</strong> Suppose that \(A \leq_m B\).</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
If \(B\) is computable, then so is \(A\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If \(B\) is computably enumerable, then so is \(A\).</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
By contraposing
 <a href="#redthm">Proposition 3.5</a>
 it thus follows that in order to show that a set \(B\) is
non-computable (or non-c.e.) it suffices to show that a known
non-computable (or non-c.e.) set can be reduced to it. As an initial
example, observe that the Diagonal Halting Problem \(K = \{i :
\phi_i(i) \darrow\}\) is reducible to the Halting Problem \(\HP =
\{\langle i,n \rangle : \phi_i(n) \darrow\}\) by the reduction
\(f(x) = \langle x,x \rangle\)&mdash;i.e., the computable pairing
function of \(x\) with itself is a many-one reduction showing \(K
\leq_m \HP\). Thus since \(\HP\) is known to be non-computable, this
gives another proof that \(K\) also is not computable.</p>

<p>
Reducibility notions also typically come with an associated notion of
what it means for a designated set to be <em>complete</em> relative to
a class of sets&mdash;i.e., a set to which every set in the class may
be reduced and which is itself a member of the class. As an initial
example we have the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.4:</strong> A set \(B\) is said to be
<em>many-one</em> (or \(m\)-) <em>complete</em> for the computably
enumerable sets just in case the following conditions hold:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
\(B\) is computable enumerable;</p></li>

<li>

<p>
For all computably enumerable sets \(A\), \(A \leq_m B\).</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
An obvious example of a complete c.e. set is \(\HP\). For since \(\HP
= \{\langle i,n \rangle : \exists s T_1(i,n,s)\}\) and \(T_1(x,y,z)\)
is a computable relation, it follows from
 <a href="#ceequivdefs">Proposition 3.2</a>
 that \(\HP\) is c.e. And on the other hand, if \(A = W_i\), then \(n
\in A\) if and only if \(\langle i,n \rangle \in \HP\) thus showing
that \(W_i \leq_m \HP\).</p>

<p>
It is, nonetheless, standard to take \(K\) rather than \(\HP\) as the
canonical complete c.e. Although it might at first seem that \(K\)
contains &ldquo;less computational information&rdquo; than \(\HP\), it
is not hard to see that \(K\) is also such that every c.e. set is
\(m\)-reducible to it. For supposing that \(A = W_i\), we may define a
function </p> 

\[\begin{aligned} \label{redK}
f(x,y) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{ if } \phi_i(x) \darrow \text{ (i.e., $x \in A$)} \\
\uarrow &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}\end{aligned}\]

<p>
As \(f(x,y)\) is clearly partial computable, the
 <a href="#snmthm"><i>s-m-n</i> Theorem (3.1)</a>
 gives a total recursive function \(s^2_1(i,x)\) such that \(f(x,y)
\simeq \phi_{s^2_1(i,x)}(y)\). We then have </p> 

\[n \in A \ \Leftrightarrow \ \phi_i(n) \darrow \ \Leftrightarrow \ \phi_{s^2_1(i,n)}(s^2_1(i,n)) \darrow \  \Leftrightarrow \ s^2_1(i,n) \in K\]

<p>
These biconditionals hold because \(\phi_i(n) \darrow\) just in
case \(\phi_{s^2_1(i,n)}(y)\) is \(\const_1(x)\) (i.e., the constant
1-function) as opposed to the everywhere undefined function just in
case \(\phi_{s^2_1(i,n)}(s^2_1(i,n)) \darrow\). But as the later
condition is equivalent to \(s^2_1(i,n) \in K\), \(s^2_1(i,x)\) is a
many-one reduction showing \(A \leq_m K\).</p>

<p>
This illustrates a sense in which deciding membership in \(K\) can
also be understood as universal for computably enumerable sets or,
alternatively, that there is no c.e. set which is any
&ldquo;harder&rdquo; to solve than \(K\). Nonetheless, there are
problems that are harder to solve than \(K\) in the sense that they
could not be solved even if we possessed a decision algorithm for
\(K\). For instance, it will follow from results given below that
while \(K\) is \(m\)-reducible to \(\TOT\), \(\TOT\) is not \(m\)-reducible
to \(K\). This illustrates how \(m\)-reducibility can be
used to study the <em>relative difficulty</em> of solving
computational problems.</p>

<p>
These considerations lead naturally to the notion of a <em>degree of
difficulty</em>&mdash;another concept which can be made precise with
respect to different reducibility notions. The version for many-one
reducibility is given by the following definition:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.5:</strong> If \(A\) and \(B\) are many-one
reducible to each other&mdash;i.e., \(A \leq_m B\) and \(B \leq_m
A\)&mdash;then we say that \(A\) and \(B\) are <em>many-one
equivalent</em> and we write \(A \equiv_m B\).</p>
</div>

<p>
It follows immediately from
 <a href="#mred">Definition 3.3</a>
 that \(\leq_m\) is reflexive. It is also clearly transitive. (For if
\(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) are computable functions which respectively
serve as many-one reductions showing \(A \leq_m B\) and \(B \leq_m
C\), then their composition \(f(g(x))\) is a many-one reduction
showing \(A \leq_m C\).) As it thus follows that \(\equiv_m\) is an
equivalence relation, it also makes sense to define the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.6:</strong> \(\textrm{deg}_m(A)\)&mdash;the
<em>many-one</em> (or \(m\)-) <em>degree</em> of \(A\)&mdash;is the
equivalence class of \(A\) with respect to \(\equiv_m\)&mdash;i.e.,
\(\textrm{deg}_m(A) = \{B \subseteq \mathbb{N} : B \equiv_m A\}\).  We call an \(m\)-degree <em>computable</em> if it contains a
computable set and <em>c.e</em>.&nbsp;if it contains a computably enumerable
set. </p>
</div>

<p>
The \(m\)-degree \(\textrm{deg}(A)\) of \(A\) collects together
all sets which are many-one equivalent to it. It can thus be thought
of as an abstract representation of the relative difficulty of
deciding membership in \(A\) when this latter notion is in turn
explicated in terms of \(m\)-reducibility. For instance, since our
prior observations show that \(\textrm{deg}_m(\HP) =
\textrm{deg}_m(K)\), they are thus &ldquo;equally difficult&rdquo;
c.e.&nbsp;degrees.</p>

<p>
It is traditional to use boldface lower case Roman letters
\(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}, \ldots\) to denote degrees (although it
should be kept in mind that these are <em>sets of sets of natural
numbers</em>). We next define an ordering on \(m\)-degrees as
follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.7:</strong> Let \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\)
be \(m\)-degrees. We then define</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
\(\mathbf{a} \leq_m \mathbf{b}\) just in case there is a set \(A \in
\mathbf{a}\) and a set \(B \in \mathbf{b}\) such that \(A \leq_m
B\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\mathbf{a} &lt;_m \mathbf{b}\) just in case \(\mathbf{a} \leq_m
\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \neq \mathbf{b}\).</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
It is easy to see that \(&lt;_m\) is a partial order on
\(m\)-degrees&mdash;i.e., irreflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
We accordingly introduce the structure \(\mathcal{D}_m = \langle
\{\textrm{deg}_m(A) : A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\}, &lt;_m\rangle\) which
is traditionally known as the <em>many-one</em> (or <em>m</em>-)
<em>degrees</em>.</p>

<p>
Together with the similar study of the Turing degrees (which will be
defined in
 <a href="#TuriDegr">Section 3.5.2</a>),
 investigating the structure of \(\mathcal{D}_m\) has been a major
focus of research in computability theory since the time of
Post&rsquo;s (1944) introduction of the many-one degrees. Some
properties of this structure are as follows:</p>

<div class="indent" id="mdegsprops">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.6:</strong></p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
The \(m\)-degrees are not closed under complementation&mdash;i.e.,
there exist sets \(A\) such that \(A \not\equiv_m \overline{A}\) and
thus \(\overline{A} \not\in \textrm{deg}(A)\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\mathbf{0} =_{\textrm{df}} \textrm{deg}_m(\emptyset) =
\{\emptyset\}\) and \(\mathbf{n} =_{\textrm{df}}
\textrm{deg}_m(\mathbb{N}) = \{\mathbb{N}\}\) are distinct
\(m\)-degrees both of which are (trivially) computable.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
There is exactly one computable \(m\)-degree \(\mathbf{0}_m\) other
than \(\mathbf{0}\) and \(\mathbf{n}\)&mdash;i.e., \(\mathbf{0}_m =
\textrm{deg}(A)\) for any computable set \(A \neq \emptyset, A\neq
\mathbb{N}\). Additionally, \(\mathbf{0}_m\) is minimal in
\(\mathcal{D}_m\) in the sense that \(\mathbf{0}_m \leq_m \mathbf{a}\)
for all degrees \(\mathbf{a}\) other than \(\mathbf{0}\) and
\(\mathbf{n}\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If \(\mathbf{b}\) is a c.e.&nbsp;degree and \(\mathbf{a} \leq_m
\mathbf{b}\), then \(\mathbf{a}\) is also a c.e.&nbsp;degree.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
There is a <em>maximum</em> c.e.&nbsp;\(m\)-degree&mdash;i.e.,
\(\textrm{deg}_m(K) =_{\textrm{df}} \mathbf{0}'_m\)&mdash;in the
sense that \(\mathbf{a} \leq \mathbf{0}'_m\) for all
c.e.&nbsp;degrees \(\mathbf{a}\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Any pair of \(m\)-degrees \(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\) have a <em>least
upper bound</em> \(\mathbf{c}\)&mdash;i.e., \(\mathbf{a} \leq_m
\mathbf{c}\) and \(\mathbf{b} \leq_m \mathbf{c}\) and \(\mathbf{c}\)
is \(\leq_m\)-less than any other upper bound of \(\mathbf{a}\) and
\(\mathbf{b}\). Since we have seen that \(\leq_m\) is also a partial
order, this implies that \(\mathcal{D}_m\) is additionally an
<em>upper semi-lattice</em>.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
There exists a c.e.&nbsp;degree \(\mathbf{a}\) properly between
\(\mathbf{0}_m\) and \(\mathbf{a} &lt; \mathbf{0}'_m\)&mdash;i.e.,
\(\mathbf{0}_m &lt; \mathbf{a} &lt; \mathbf{0}'_m\).</p></li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>
Post (1944) demonstrated part vii by showing that there exist
so-called <em>simple sets</em>&mdash;i.e., sets \(A\) which are
c.e.&nbsp;and such that \(\overline{A}\) is infinite but does not
contain an infinite c.e.&nbsp;subset. It is easy to see that a simple
set cannot be computable. But on the other hand, Post also showed that
a simple set cannot be \(m\)-complete. And it thus follows that if
\(A\) is simple \(\mathbf{a} =_{\textrm{df}} \textrm{deg}_m(A) \neq
\mathbf{0}_m\) but \(A \not\equiv_m K\) and thus \(\mathbf{a} &lt;
\mathbf{0}'_m\). Suppose we now understand &ldquo;degrees of
unsolvability&rdquo; in the passage quoted at the beginning of this
section as corresponding to the c.e.&nbsp;\(m\)-degrees. It thus
follows from part v of
 <a href="#mdegsprops">Proposition 3.6</a> that
\(\mathbf{0}'_m\) is indeed a &ldquo;highest&rdquo; such degree
and also from part vii that there is a lower but still
&ldquo;unsolvable&rdquo; (i.e., non-computable) degree.</p>

<p>
Although the other parts of
 <a href="#mdegsprops">Proposition 3.6</a> have
straightforward proofs, they provide some insight into the fact that
\(\mathcal{D}_m\) is itself a highly complex structure (see, e.g.,
Odifreddi 1999b, 1). Nonetheless the first two parts of this theorem
are often taken to illustrate awkward features of the many-one degrees
as an abstract representation of computational difficulty&mdash;i.e.,
the exceptional behavior of \(\textrm{deg}_m(\emptyset)\) and
\(\textrm{deg}_m(\mathbb{N})\) and the fact a set and its complement
may inhabit different degrees (as is easy to see is exemplified by
\(K\) and \(\overline{K}\)). It is partly in light of these features
that the Turing degrees \(\mathcal{D}_T\) are the structure which are
now most widely studied in computability theory. But as Post also
alludes, it is relative to \(\mathcal{D}_T\) for which he was
originally unable to demonstrate the existence of a c.e.&nbsp;set of
an intermediate degree of unsolvability.</p>

<h4 id="TuriDegr">3.5.2 The Turing degrees</h4>

<p>
The notion of <em>relative computability</em> mentioned at the
beginning of this section is now standardly analyzed in terms of
<em>computability in a set</em> \(A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\).
Informally, we say that a function \(f(\vec{x})\) is computable in
\(A\) just in case there exists an algorithm which is effective in the
traditional sense with the exception of the fact its computation may
rely on computing one or more values \(\chi_A(y)\). These values are
in turn assumed to be available to the algorithm in a single step even
though \(\chi_A(y)\) may not itself be computable&mdash;e.g., if \(A =
K\).</p>

<p>
This notion was originally introduced by Turing (1939) who described
what he referred to as an <em>oracle</em> (or <em>o</em>-)
<em>machine</em> variant of the standard Turing Machine model
\(\mathbf{T}\). An o-machine is otherwise like a normal Turing machine
but also possesses a read-only <em>oracle tape</em> (and corresponding
read-only head) on which the characteristic function of a set \(A\) is
assumed to be written at the beginning of its computation. The
transitions of an o-machine are determined by its internal state
together with the currently scanned symbols on both its read-write
tape and the oracle tape, thus formalizing the idea that the machine
may &ldquo;consult the oracle&rdquo; about the characteristic function
of \(A\) one or more times during the course of its
 computation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
Kleene (1943) described an analogous idea for the <em>general
recursive functions</em> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A function \(\phi\) which can be defined from given functions
\(\psi_1, \ldots, \psi_k\) by a series of applications of general
recursive schemata we call <em>general recursive in</em> the given
functions; and in particular, a function definable <em>ab initio</em>
by these means we call <em>general recursive</em>. (Kleene 1943:
44)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The former part of this characterization differs from the definition
of general recursiveness given in
 <a href="#GeneRecuFunc">Section 1.5</a>
 in allowing that in addition to the initial functions \(\mathbf{0}\)
and \(s(x)\), the functions \(\psi_1, \ldots, \psi_k\) can also enter
into systems of equations which define the function \(\phi\). This
corresponds to the assumption that the values of \(\psi_1, \ldots,
\psi_k\) are available in the course of a computation without the need
for further calculation.</p>

<p>
It is also possible to modify the definition of the <em>partial
recursive functions</em> given in
 <a href="#Defi_1">Section 2.2.1</a>
 to allow such relativization to an additional class of initial
functions. Since relativization to a finite set of functions can be
accomplished by successive relativization to a single function and the
graph of a function can also be coded into a set, this is now
standardly achieved as follows:</p>

<div class="indent" id="Apartrecdef">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.8:</strong> Given a set \(A \subseteq
\mathbb{N}\), we define the class of \(A\)-<em>partial recursive
functions</em> \(\mathbf{PartREC}^A\) to be the smallest class of
partial functions containing the initial functions \(I_A =
\{\mathbf{0},s,\pi^i_k,\chi_A(x)\}\) and closed under the
functionals</p> 

 \[Op_{\mathbf{PartREC}} = \{\mathcal{Comp}^i_j,\mathcal{PrimRec}_k,\mathcal{Min}_k\}.\]

</div>

<p>
There are, of course, uncountably many subsets of the natural numbers.
But for each such \(A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\), we may still understand
\(\chi_A(x)\) as a new primitive functional symbol which can be
employed in constructing one of countably many \(A\)-partial recursive
definitions in the manner discussed in
 <a href="#Defi">Section 2.1.1</a>.
It is thus also possible to list off all of the unary \(A\)-partial
recursive functions relative to the codes of their definitions to
obtain a uniform enumeration </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\phi_0^{A}(x), \phi_1^{A}(x), \phi^{A}_2(x), \ldots\end{aligned}\]

<p>
and similarly for other arities. It is thus not difficult to see that
we can thereby also obtain relativized versions of results like the
 <a href="#snmthm"><i>s-m-n</i> Theorem (3.1)</a>
 and the Universality Theorem
 (<a href="#univthm">3.2</a>)
 as exemplified by the following:</p>

<div class="indent" id="Aunivthm">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.6:</strong> For all \(A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\),
there is an \(A\)-partial computable function \(\upsilon\) which is
<em>universal</em> in the sense that for all unary \(A\)-partial
computable functions \(f(\vec{x})\), there is an \(i \in \mathbb{N}\)
such that \(\upsilon^{A}(i,x) \simeq f(x)\).</p>
</div>

<p>
These observations in turn license the use of the expression
<em>computable in \(A\)</em> to describe both a function
\(f(\vec{x})\) which is \(A\)-partial recursive and total and also a
set \(B\) such that \(\chi_B(x)\) is computable in \(A\). We also use
the expression <em>computably enumerable</em> (c.e.) <em>in \(A\)</em>
to describe a set \(B\) which is the range of an \(A\)-partial
recursive function and the notation \(W^A_e\) to denote the domain of
\(\phi^{A}_e(x)\). It is then straightforward to see that many of our
prior proofs about <em>non-computability</em> also carry over to the
relativized setting&mdash;e.g., \(K^A = \{i : \phi^{A}_i(i)\darrow\}\) is an example of a set which is computably enumerable in \(A\) but not computable in \(A\).</p>

<p>
We may now state the definition of <em>Turing reducibility</em> as
follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.9:</strong> Given sets \(A, B \subseteq
\mathbb{N}\), \(A\) is said to be <em>Turing</em> (or \(T\)-)
<em>reducible</em> to \(B\) just in case \(A\) is computable in \(B\).
In this case we write \(A \leq_T B\).</p>
</div>

<p>
It is a consequence of this definition that \(A \leq_T B\) just in
case \(\chi_A(x)\) coincides with the (total) \(B\)-computable
function given by \(\phi^{B}_e(x)\) for some index \(e\). For instance
if we adopt Turing&rsquo;s characterization of relative computability,
we may think of \(e\) as describing a program for a machine which can
consult \(B\) as an oracle. In this case, \(A \leq_T B\) means that it
is possible to decide if \(n \in A\) by carrying out the program
described by \(e\) on the input \(n\) which may in turn require
performing queries to the oracle \(B\) during the course of its
computation.</p>

<p>
We may also define a notion of completeness with respect to \(\leq_T\)
as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.10:</strong> We say that \(B\) is <em>Turing
complete</em> if \(B\) is c.e.&nbsp;and all c.e.&nbsp;sets \(A\) are
such that \(A \leq_T B\).</p>
</div>

<p>
It is easy to see that \(A \leq_m B\) implies \(A \leq_T B\). (For if
\(f(x)\) is a \(m\)-reduction of \(A\) to \(B\), then consider the
program which first computes \(f(n)\) and then, using \(B\) an as
oracle, checks if \(f(n) \in B\), outputting 1 if so and 0 if not.) It
thus follows that \(K\) is also Turing complete&mdash;i.e., it
embodies the maximum &ldquo;degree of unsolvability&rdquo; among the
the c.e.&nbsp;sets when this notion is understood in terms of Turing
reducibility as well as many-one reducibility.</p>

<p>
Such observations can be made precise by first defining the notion of
Turing equivalence:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.11:</strong> If \(A\) and \(B\) are Turing
reducible to each other&mdash;i.e., \(A \leq_T B\) and \(B \leq_T
A\)&mdash;then we say that \(A\) and \(B\) are <em>Turing
equivalent</em> and we write \(A \equiv_T B\).</p>
</div>

<p>
As it is again easy to see that \(\equiv_T\) is an equivalence
relation, we may also define the notion of <em>Turing degree</em> as
follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.12:</strong> \(\textrm{deg}_T(A)\)&mdash;the
<em>Turing degree</em> of \(A\)&mdash;is the equivalence class of
\(A\) with respect to \(\equiv_T\)&mdash;i.e., \(\textrm{deg}_T(A) =
\{B \subseteq \mathbb{N} : B \equiv_T A\}\).</p>
</div>

<p>
We can now define an ordering on Turing degrees as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.13:</strong> Let \(\mathbf{a}\) and
\(\mathbf{b}\) be Turing degrees. We then define</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
\(\mathbf{a} \leq_T \mathbf{b}\) just in case there is a set \(A \in
\mathbf{a}\) and a set \(B \in \mathbf{b}\) such that \(A \leq_T
B\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\mathbf{a} &lt;_T \mathbf{b}\) just in case \(\mathbf{a} \leq_T
\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \neq \mathbf{b}\).</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
As with the \(m\)-degrees, we say that \(\mathbf{a}\) is a
<em>computable Turing degree</em> if it contains a computable set
and a <em>computably enumerable</em> (c.e.) <em>degree</em> if it
contains a c.e.&nbsp;set. If we consider the structure</p>

\[\mathcal{D}_T = \langle \{\textrm{deg}_T(A) : A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\},\leq_T\rangle
\]

<p>
&mdash;which is known as the <em>Turing
degrees</em>&mdash;it is again easy to see that \(\leq_T\) is a
partial order. Some observations which illustrate the relationship
between \(\mathcal{D}_T\) and the many-one degrees \(\mathcal{D}_m\)
are as follows:</p>

<div class="indent" id="Tdegsprops">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.7:</strong></p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
There is exactly one computable Turing degree denoted by
\(\mathbf{0}_T = \textrm{deg}_T(\emptyset)\) (which is often written
\(\mathbf{0}\) when there is no possibility of ambiguity with the
\(m\)-degrees). \(\mathbf{0}_T\) consists of all of the computable
sets and is the unique minimum Turing degree.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
For all sets \(A\), and \(A \equiv_T \overline{A}\) and thus also
\(\textrm{deg}_T(A) = \textrm{deg}_T(\overline{A})\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\textrm{deg}_T(K)\) is the maximum amongst all c.e.&nbsp;Turing
degrees.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
For any sets \(A,B\), \(\textrm{deg}_m(A) \subseteq
\textrm{deg}_T(A)\) and if </p> 

  \[\textrm{deg}_m(A) \leq_m \textrm{deg}_m(B),\]

 

  <p>then</p> \[\textrm{deg}_T(A) \leq_T \textrm{deg}_T(B).\]</li>

</ol>
</div>

<p>
Since \(\emptyset\) and \(\mathbb{N}\) are both (trivially) computable
sets, by part i) we have \(\textrm{deg}_T(\emptyset) =
\textrm{deg}_T(\mathbb{N}) = \mathbf{0}_T\), unlike the \(m\)-degrees.
And also unlike the \(m\)-degrees we have by part ii that
\(\textrm{deg}_T(A) = \textrm{deg}_T(\overline{A})\). (For if we can
decide \(B\) via an algorithm which uses \(A\) an as oracle, then we
can also decide it using \(\overline{A}\) as an oracle by simply
swapping the responses obtained in our former algorithm.)</p>

<p>
The structures of both \(\mathcal{D}_T\) and the c.e.&nbsp;degrees</p>

\[\mathcal{E}_T = \langle \{\textrm{deg}_T(A) : A \text{ is c.e.}\}, \leq_T\rangle\]

<p>
have been extensively investigated since the 1950s. One of their most
basic properties may be considered by first defining the operation of
sets </p> 

\[A \oplus B = \{2n : n \in A\} \cup \{2n+1 : n \in B\}.\]

<p>
\(A \oplus B\) is called the <em>effective join</em> of \(A\) and
\(B\) as it encodes the &ldquo;information&rdquo; contained in \(A\)
on the even members of \(A \oplus B\) and that contained \(B\) on its
odd members. \(A \oplus B\) is c.e.&nbsp;if both \(A\) and \(B\) are.
Suppose we also define the operation </p> 

\[\textrm{deg}_T(A) \vee \textrm{deg}_T(B) =_{\textrm{df}} \textrm{deg}(A \oplus B)\]

<p>
on the degrees \(\mathbf{a} = \textrm{deg}_T(A)\) and \(\mathbf{b} =
\textrm{deg}_T(B)\). Then it is not difficult to see that \(\mathbf{a}
\vee \mathbf{b}\) is the <em>least upper bound</em> of \(\mathbf{a}\)
and \(\mathbf{b}\) with respect to the structure \(\mathcal{D}_T\).
Like the \(m\)-degrees, \(\mathcal{D}_T\) and \(\mathcal{E}_T\) both
form an <em>upper semi-lattice</em>&mdash;i.e., a partial order in
which least upper bounds always
 exist.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
Given \(A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\), we may also consider \(K^A =\{n :
\phi^{A}_n(n) \darrow\}\)&mdash;i.e., the set considered above
which corresponds to the Diagonal Halting Problem relativized to the
oracle \(A\). \(K^A\) is referred to as the <em>jump</em> of \(A\) for
which we also write \(A'\). This notation is also used to denote
an operation on Turing degrees by setting \(\mathbf{a}' =
\textrm{deg}_T(A')\) for some representative \(A \in \mathbf{a}\).
The following collects together several facts about the jump operation
on both sets and degrees:</p>

<div class="indent" id="tdegprops">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.7:</strong> For any set \(A, B \subseteq
\mathbb{N}\) with \(\textrm{deg}_T(A) = \mathbf{a}\) and

<li>

<p>

\(\mathbf{a} &lt;_T \mathbf{a}'\)</p></li>

<li>

\(\mathbf{0}' \leq_T \mathbf{a}'\)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If \(B\) is c.e.&nbsp;in \(A\), then \(\mathbf{b} \leq_T
\mathbf{a}'\).</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
Part ii of
 <a href="#tdegprops">Proposition 3.7</a>
 records the fact that the basic result that \(K\) is c.e.&nbsp;but
not computable holds for computability relativized to any set \(A\).
From this it follows that \(A &lt;_T A'\) and thus also that the
result of iterating the jump operation on any set \(A\) yields a
sequence </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
A^{(0)} &amp; = A, \\
A^{(1)} &amp; = \left(A^{(0)}\right)' = A', \\
A^{(2)} &amp; = \left(A^{(1)}\right)' = A'', \\
\vdots \\
A^{(i+1)} &amp;= \left(A^{(i)}\right)', \\
\vdots
\end{aligned}\] 

<p>
for which \(A^{(0)} &lt;_T A^{(1)} &lt;_T A^{(2)} &lt;_T \ldots\). As
benchmarks in the Turing degrees we also define the sets</p>

 \[\begin{aligned}
\emptyset^0 &amp; = \emptyset, \\
\emptyset' &amp; = K, \\
\emptyset'' &amp; = K', \\
\vdots \\
\emptyset^{(i+1)} &amp; = K^{(i)'}, \\
\vdots
\end{aligned}\] 

<p>
and the degrees \(\mathbf{0}^{(n)} =
\textrm{deg}_T(\emptyset^{(n)})\). Note that the latter correspond to
a linearly ordered sequence </p> 

\[
\mathbf{0} &lt;_T \mathbf{0}' &lt; _T\mathbf{0}'' &lt;_T \ldots &lt;_T \mathbf{0}^{(n)} &lt;_T \ldots

As depicted in Figure 2, it is possible to use this sequence to
classify many of the problems defined in

</ol>

<p>
Such classifications illustrate how the position of a set within
\(\mathcal{D}_T\) can be understood as a measure of how far away it is
from being computable&mdash;i.e., of its <em>degree of
unsolvability</em> or <em>difficulty</em>. However unlike other
conventional measurement scales, the structure of \(\mathcal{D}_T\) is
neither simple nor is it always straightforward to discern. Some
evidence to this effect was provided by the fact that the answer to
the following question was posed but left unanswered by Post
 (1944):<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<div class="indent" id="postprob">

<p>
<strong>Question 3.1</strong> (<em>Post&rsquo;s Problem</em>): Is
there a c.e.&nbsp;degree \(\mathbf{a}\) such that \(\mathbf{0} &lt;_T
\mathbf{a} &lt;_T \mathbf{0}'\)?</p>
</div>

<p>
Post&rsquo;s problem was eventually answered in the positive
independently by Friedberg (1957) and Muchnik (1956) who showed the
following:</p>

<div class="indent" id="fmthm">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.8:</strong> There are c.e.&nbsp;sets \(A\) and \(B\)
such that \(A \nleq_T B\) and \(B \nleq_T A\). Thus if \(\mathbf{a} =
\textrm{deg}_T(A)\) and \(\mathbf{b} = \textrm{deg}_T(B)\), then
\(\mathbf{a} \nleq_T \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{b} \nleq_T
\mathbf{a}\) and hence also \(\mathbf{0} &lt;_T \mathbf{a} &lt;_T
\mathbf{0}'\) and \(\mathbf{0} &lt;_T \mathbf{b} &lt;
_T\mathbf{0}'\).</p>
</div>

<p>
The proof of
 <a href="#fmthm">Friedberg-Muchnik Theorem (3.8)</a>
 required the development of a new technique known as the <em>priority
method</em> (or also as the <em>injury method</em>) which has become a
central tool in the subsequent development of computability theory.
The method provides a means of constructing a c.e.&nbsp;set \(A\) with a
certain property \(P\) which may be described as follows: </p>

<ol type="i">

<li> the desired properties of \(A\) are divided into an infinite list
of <em>requirements</em> \(R_0, R_1, R_2, \ldots\) such that if all of
the \(R_i\) are satisfied, then \(A\) will satisfy \(P\); </li>

<li> the requirements are then associated with <em>priorities</em>
corresponding to an ordering in which their satisfaction is to be
preserved by the construction&mdash;e.g., \(R_0\) might have the
highest (or &ldquo;most important&rdquo;) priority, \(R_1\) the second
highest priority, \(\ldots\); </li>

<li> \(A\) is then constructed in stages \(A_0,A_1,A_2, \ldots, A_s,
\ldots\) with each stage \(s\) attempting to satisfy the highest
priority requirement \(R_j\) which is currently unsatisfied, either by
adding numbers to the current approximation \(A_s\) of \(A\) or by
prohibiting other numbers from entering \(A_t\) at a later stage \(t
&gt; s\); </li>

<li> it may happen that by satisfying some requirement \(R_i\) at
stage \(s\) the process causes another requirement \(R_j\) to become
unsatisfied (i.e., stage \(s\) <em>injures</em> \(R_j\)); </li>

<li> in this case, the priority ordering is consulted in order to
determine what action to take. </li>
</ol>

<p>
In the case of
 <a href="#fmthm">Theorem 3.8</a>,
 this technique is used to simultaneously construct the two
c.e.&nbsp;sets \(A\) and \(B\) of degree intermediate between
\(\mathbf{0}\) and \(\mathbf{0}'\) by alternating between the
requirements \(R_{2i}\) which entail that \(A \neq \{n : \phi^{B}_i(n)
\darrow = 1\}\) at even stages to ensure \(A \nleq_T B\) and
requirements \(R_{2i+1}\) which entail that \(B \neq \{n :
\phi^{A}_i(n) \darrow = 1\}\) at odd stages so as to ensure \(B
\nleq_T A\).</p>

<p>
Sophisticated application of the priority method have been employed in
computability theory from the 1960s onward to investigate the
structure of \(\mathcal{D}_T\) and
 \(\mathcal{E}_T\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup>
 Some illustrative results which can be obtained either in this manner
or more elementary techniques are as follows:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
There are continuum (i.e., \(2^{\aleph_0}\)) many distinct Turing
degrees. In particular, although for a given degree \(\mathbf{a}\) the
set of \(\mathbf{b}\) such that \(\mathbf{b} \leq_T \mathbf{a}\) is
countable, the set of \(\mathbf{b}\) such that \(\mathbf{a} &lt;_T
\mathbf{b}\) is uncountable (Kleene &amp; Post 1954).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
For every degree \(\mathbf{a} \not\equiv_T \mathbf{0}\), there exists a
degree \(\mathbf{b}\) which is <em>incomparable</em> to
\(\mathbf{a}\)&mdash;i.e., \(\mathbf{b} \nleq_T \mathbf{a}\) and
\(\mathbf{a} \nleq_T \mathbf{b}\). Moreover, there is a set of
\(2^{\aleph_0}\) pairwise incompatible degrees (Kleene &amp; Post
1954).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
There are <em>minimal degrees</em> \(\mathbf{m}\)&mdash;i.e., degrees
for which there is no \(\mathbf{a}\) such that \(\mathbf{0} &lt;_T
\mathbf{a} &lt;_T \mathbf{m}\) (Sacks 1963b). Thus in general
\(&lt;_T\) is <em>not</em> a dense order. (But by fact vii below,
there are not minimal c.e.&nbsp;degrees.)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
There are pairs of degrees \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) which do
not possess a greatest lower bound. Thus although \(\mathcal{D}_T\) is
an upper semi-lattice, it is not a lattice (Kleene &amp; Post 1954).
The same is true of \(\mathcal{E}_T\) (Lachlan 1966).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Every countable partially ordered set can be embedded into
\(\mathcal{D}_T\) (Thomason 1971). However this is <em>not</em> true
of \(\mathcal{E}_T\) into which there are finite non-distributive
lattices which cannot be embedded (Lachlan &amp; Soare 1980).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
There is a non-c.e.&nbsp;degree \(\mathbf{a} &lt;_T \mathbf{0}'\)
(Shoenfield 1960).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
For any c.e.&nbsp;degrees \(\mathbf{a} &lt;_T \mathbf{b}\), there is a
c.e.&nbsp;degree \(\mathbf{c}\) such that \(\mathbf{a} &lt;_T \mathbf{c}
&lt;_T \mathbf{b}\) (Sacks 1964). Thus unlike the Turing degrees in
general, the c.e.&nbsp;degrees <em>are</em> densely ordered.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
For any c.e.&nbsp;degree \(\mathbf{a} &gt;_T \mathbf{0}\), there are
incomparable c.e.&nbsp;degrees \(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c} &lt;_T
\mathbf{a}\) such that \(\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{b} \cup \mathbf{c}\)
(Sacks 1963b).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Let \(\textrm{Th}({\mathcal{D}_T})\) be the first-order theory of the
structure \(\mathcal{D}_T\) in the language with the with \(\equiv_T\)
and \(\leq_T\). Not only is \(\textrm{Th}({\mathcal{D}_T})\)
undecidable (Lachlan 1968), it is fact many-one equivalent to <em>true
second-order arithmetic</em> (Simpson 1977).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
As is easily shown to be true of the join operation \(\mathbf{a} \vee
\mathbf{b}\), the jump operation \(\mathbf{a}' = \mathbf{b}\) is
definable in \(\mathcal{D}_T\) in the language with \(\equiv_T\) and \(\leq_T\)
(Shore &amp; Slaman 1999).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
These properties attest to the complexity of \(\mathcal{D}_T\) as a
mathematical structure. A related question is whether
\(\mathcal{D}_T\) is <em>rigid</em> in the following sense:</p>

<div class="indent" id="cooperprob">

<p>
<strong>Question 3.2:</strong> Does there exist a <em>non-trivial
automorphism</em> of \(\mathcal{D}_T\)&mdash;i.e., a mapping \(\pi:
\mathcal{D}_T \rightarrow \mathcal{D}_T\) which preserves \(\leq_T\)
and is not the identity?</p>
</div>

<p>
A negative answer to this question would show that the relation of
\(\textrm{deg}_T(A)\) to other degrees uniquely determines the degree
of unsolvability of \(A\) relative to \(\mathcal{D}_T\). Recent work has pointed in this direction (see, e.g., Slaman 2008). Nonetheless, at the time of the
2020 update to this entry,
 <a href="#cooperprob">Question 3.2</a>
 remains a significant open problem in computability
theory whose origins can be traced back to the original foundational
work of Turing, Post, and Kleene surveyed above.</p>

<h3 id="AritAnalHier">3.6 The Arithmetical and Analytical Hierarchies</h3>

<p>
The many-one degrees \(\mathcal{D}_m\) and the Turing degrees
\(\mathcal{D}_T\) are sometimes referred to as <em>hierarchies</em> in
the sense that they determine an ordering on
\(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\)&mdash;i.e., the set of subsets of the
natural numbers&mdash;in terms of relative computability. In a series
of papers from the 1940s and 1950s, Kleene (initiating in 1943) and
Mostowski (initiating in 1947) realized that it was also possible to
impose another sort of ordering on \(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\) in terms of the
logical complexity of the simplest predicate which defines a set \(A
\subseteq \mathbb{N}\) in the languages of first- or second-order
arithmetic. This idea leads to what are known as the
<em>arithmetical</em> and <em>analytical hierarchies</em>, both of
which can be understood as classifying sets in terms of their
<em>definitional</em> (or <em>descriptive</em>) complexity. As we will
see, the resulting classifications are related to those determined
relative to \(\mathcal{D}_T\) in terms of relative computability. They
are also similar in form to other definability hierarchies studied in
 <a href="../computational-complexity/index.html#PolHiePolSpaExpTim">computational complexity theory</a>
 (e.g., the <em>polynomial hierarchy</em>) and
 <a href="../set-theory/index.html#DesSetThe">descriptive set theory</a>
 (e.g., the <em>Borel</em> and <em>projective hierarchies</em>).</p>

<h4 id="AritHier">3.6.1 The arithmetical hierarchy</h4>

<p>
Recall that according to the definitions given in
 <a href="#CompCompEnumSets">Section 3.3</a>,
 a <em>relation</em> \(R \subseteq \mathbb{N}^k\) is said to be
<em>computable</em> just in case its characteristic function
\(\chi_R(\vec{x})\) is a computable function and <em>computably
enumerable</em> just in case it is the range of a computable function.
In order to introduce the arithmetical hierarchy, it is useful to
employ an alternative characterization of computable and computably
enumerable relations in the form of a semantic analog to the
proof-theoretic notion of <em>arithmetical representability</em>
discussed in
 <a href="#AritReprGodeFirsIncoTheo">Section 1.3</a>.</p>
 

<p>
Recall that the <em>language of first-order arithmetic</em>
\(\mathcal{L}_a\) contains the primitive symbols
\(\{&lt;,',+,\times,0\}\) respectively intended to denote the less
than relation, successor, addition, and multiplication functions on
the natural numbers as well as the first natural number 0. A
<em>first-order arithmetical formula</em> is one built up from these
expressions using variables, propositional connectives, and the
first-order quantifiers \(\forall x, \exists x\) where the variables
are intended to range over the natural numbers
\(\mathbb{N}\). Recall also that the <em>standard model of first-order
arithmetic</em> is the structure \(\mathfrak{N} = \langle
\mathbb{N},0,&lt;,s,+,\times \rangle\) in which the symbols of
\(\mathcal{L}_a\) receive their intended interpretations. Finally we
say that an \(\mathcal{L}_a\)-formula \(\varphi(\vec{x})\)
<em>defines</em> a relation \(R \subseteq \mathbb{N}^k\) just in case
\(R = \{\langle n_1,\ldots,n_k \rangle : \mathfrak{N} \models
 \varphi(n_1,\ldots,n_k)\}\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup>
 For instance \(x &lt; y \vee x = y\) defines the less-than-or-equal
relation \(\leq\), \(\exists y(y + y = x)\) defines the even numbers,
and </p> 

\[\forall y \forall z(y \times z = x \rightarrow y = s(0) \vee y = x)\]

<p>
defines the prime numbers.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.14:</strong> A formula \(\varphi(\vec{x})\) of
\(\mathcal{L}_a\) is said to be in the class \(\Delta^0_0\) if it
contains only <em>bounded first-order quantifiers</em>&mdash;i.e.,
those of the form \(\exists x(x &lt; t \wedge \ldots)\) and \(\forall
x(x &lt; t \rightarrow \ldots)\) for \(t\) an \(\mathcal{L}_a\)-term
not containing \(x\). A formula is said to be in the class
\(\Sigma^0_1\) if it is of the form \(\exists \vec{y}
\varphi(\vec{x},\vec{y})\) for \(\varphi(\vec{x},\vec{y}) \in
\Delta^0_0\) and to be in the class \(\Pi^0_1\) if it is of the form
\(\forall \vec{y} \varphi(\vec{x},\vec{y})\) for
\(\varphi(\vec{x},\vec{y}) \in \Delta^0_0\). Finally, a formula
\(\varphi(\vec{x})\) is said to be in the class \(\Delta^0_1\) if it
is semantically equivalent to both a \(\Sigma^0_1\)-formula
\(\psi(\vec{x})\) and a \(\Pi^0_1\)-formula
\(\chi(\vec{x})\)&mdash;i.e., \(\mathfrak{N} \models
\varphi(\vec{n})\) iff \(\mathfrak{N} \models \psi(\vec{n})\) iff
\(\mathfrak{N} \models \chi(\vec{n})\) for all \(\vec{n} \in
\mathbb{N}^k\).</p>
</div>

<p>
It is standard to extend this syntactic classification of formulas in
terms of quantifier complexity to sets and relations on the natural
numbers which can be defined by a formula in a given class. Thus, for
instance, \(x &lt; y \vee x = y\) is a \(\Delta^0_0\)-formula and the
relation \(\leq\) on \(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\) is accordingly
said to be \(\Delta^0_0\). On the other hand, while \(\exists y(y + y
= x)\) is a \(\Sigma^0_1\)-formula, the set of even numbers is also
defined by \(\exists y &lt; x(x = 0 \vee y + y = x)\). Thus this set
is also classified as \(\Delta^0_0\) in virtue of the existence of
this latter definition which is simpler in the sense measured by the
arithmetical hierarchy.</p>

<p>
The first step in relating such classifications to
computability-theoretic notions is provided by the following:</p>

<div class="indent" id="cesigma1">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.8:</strong></p>

<ol type="i">

<li>

<p>
A relation \(R \subseteq \mathbb{N}^k\) is computably enumerable if
and only if there is a \(\Sigma^0_1\)-formula which defines
\(R(\vec{x})\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
A relation \(R \subseteq \mathbb{N}^k\) is computable if and only if
there is a \(\Delta^0_1\)-formula which defines
\(R(\vec{x})\).</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>

 <a href="#cesigma1">Proposition 3.8</a>
 may be proved by directly showing that for each partial recursive
function \(\phi_e(\vec{x})\) it is possible to construct a
corresponding \(\mathcal{L}_a\)-formula \(\varphi(\vec{x})\) whose
logical structure mimics the steps in the definition of the former.  This can be achieved by
formalizing primitive recursion using an arithmetically definable
coding of finite sequences and expressing minimization using an
unbounded existential quantifier (see, e.g., Kaye 1991, ch. 3). But it is also
possible to obtain
 <a href="#cesigma1">Proposition 3.8</a>
 in a uniform manner by showing that there is a so-called
<em>universal formula</em> for \(\Sigma^0_1\). In order
specify such a formula, first note that it is possible to effectively
enumerate all \(\Delta^0_0\)-formulas with \(k+1\) free variables as
\(\psi^{k+1}_0(x,\vec{y}), \psi^{k+1}_1(x,\vec{y}), \ldots\) and then define a
corresponding enumeration of \(\Sigma^0_1\)-formulas as
\(\varphi^k_0(\vec{y}) = \exists x \psi_0(x,\vec{y}),\)
\(\varphi^k_1(\vec{y}) = \exists x \psi_1(x,\vec{y}),\)&hellip;. We
then have the following:</p>

<div class="indent" id="enumthm">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.9</strong> (Kleene 1943): For all \(k\), there
exists a \(\Sigma^0_1\)-formula \(\sigma_{k,1}(x,\vec{y})\) such that
for all \(\Sigma^0_1\)-formulas with \(k\)-free variables
\(\varphi^k_e(\vec{y})\), the following biconditional </p>

\[\sigma_{k,1}(e,\vec{m}) \leftrightarrow \varphi^k_e(\vec{m})\]

<p>
holds in the standard model \(\mathfrak{N}\) for all \(\vec{m} \in
\mathbb{N}^k\).</p>
</div>

<p>

 <a href="#enumthm">Theorem 3.9</a>
 can be demonstrated by first observing that the truth of a
\(\Sigma^0_1\)-formula \(\varphi^k_e(\vec{x})\) is equivalent to
\(\mathfrak{N} \models \psi^k_e(n,\vec{m})\) for some \(n \in
\mathbb{N}\). Next note that the sequence of observations recorded in
 <a href="#Exam">Section 2.1.2</a>
 suffices to show that all \(\Delta^0_0\)-definable relations are
primitive recursive. We may thus consider an algorithm which on input
\(e,\vec{m}\) uses \(e\) to construct \(\psi^k_e(x,\vec{y})\) and then
performs an unbounded search for an \(n\) such that
\(\psi^k_e(n,\vec{m})\) holds. By an appeal to Church&rsquo;s Thesis
(which can, of course, be replaced by an explicit construction) there
is a computable function \(f(e)\) for which we have the following:
</p> 

\[\mathfrak{N} \models \varphi^k_e(\vec{m}) \text{ if and only if } \mu s(T_k(f(e),\vec{m},s)) \darrow\]

<p>
In order to construct the formula \(\sigma_{k,1}(e,\vec{y})\) promised
by
 <a href="#enumthm">Theorem 3.9</a>,
 observe that standard techniques from the arithmetization of syntax
allow us to obtain a \(\Delta^0_1\)-formula \(\tau_k(x,\vec{y},z)\)
which defines the Kleene \(T\)-predicate \(T_k(x,\vec{y},z)\)
introduced in
 <a href="#NormFormTheo">Section 2.2.2</a>.
 We may finally define \(\sigma_{k,1}(e,\vec{y}) = \exists z
\tau_k(f(e),\vec{y},z)\). The first part of
 <a href="#cesigma1">Proposition 3.8</a>
 now follows by letting \(e\) be such that
\(\textrm{dom}(\phi^k_e(\vec{x})) = R\) and then taking
\(\sigma_{k,1}(e_0,\vec{x}) \in \Sigma^0_1\) where \(e_0\) is such
that \(f(e_0) = e\). This is often formulated as what is known as the
<em>Enumeration Theorem</em> which can be compared to
 <a href="#univthm">Theorem 3.2</a>:</p>
 
<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.9:</strong> A relation \(R \subseteq
\mathbb{N}^k\) is computable enumerable if and only if there is a
number \(e\) (known as a <em>c.e.&nbsp;index</em> for \(R\)) such that
\(R\) is defined by \(\exists z \tau_k(e,\vec{y},z)\).</p>
</div>

<p>
The second part of
 <a href="#cesigma1">Proposition 3.8</a>
 follows by observing that if \(R\) is recursive then both \(R\) and
\(\overline{R}\) are c.e. Thus if \(e\) is a c.e.&nbsp;index for
\(R\), then \(\overline{R}\) is defined by \(\neg \exists z
\tau_k(e,\vec{x},z)\) which is equivalent to a \(\Pi^0_1\)-formula
since \(\tau_k(x,\vec{y},z) \in \Delta^0_1\).</p>

<p>
The formula classes \(\Delta^0_1\) and \(\Sigma^0_1\) thus provide an
alternative arithmetical characterization of the computable and
computably enumerable sets. These classes also define the lowest
levels of the <em>arithmetical hierarchy</em> which in full generality
is defined as follows:</p>

<div class="indent" id="arithhier">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.15:</strong> In order to simplify notation, the
classes \(\Sigma^0_0\) and \(\Pi^0_0\) are both used as alternative
names for the class \(\Delta^0_0\). A formula is said to be in
the class \(\Sigma^0_{n+1}\) if it is of the form \(\exists \vec{y}
\varphi(\vec{x},\vec{y})\) for \(\varphi(\vec{x},\vec{y}) \in
\Pi^0_n\) and to be in the class \(\Pi_{n+1}\) if it is of the form
\(\forall \vec{y} \varphi(\vec{x},\vec{y})\) for
\(\varphi(\vec{x},\vec{y}) \in \Sigma^0_n\). A formula
\(\varphi(\vec{x})\) is \(\Delta^0_{n+1}\) if it is semantically
equivalent to both a \(\Sigma^0_{n+1}\)-formula \(\psi(\vec{x})\) and
a \(\Pi^0_{n+1}\)-formula \(\chi(\vec{x})\).</p>
</div>

<p>
It thus follows that a formula is \(\Sigma^0_{n}\) just in case it is
of the form </p> 

\[\exists \vec{x}_1 \forall \vec{x}_2 \exists \vec{x}_3 \ldots \mathsf{Q} \vec{x}_n \varphi(\vec{x}_1,\vec{x}_2,\vec{x}_3,\ldots,\vec{x}_n)\]

<p>
(where there are \(n\) alternations of quantifier types and
\(\mathsf{Q}\) is \(\forall\) if \(n\) is even and \(\exists\) if
\(n\) is odd). Similarly a \(\Pi^0_n\)-formula is of the form </p>

\[\forall \vec{x}_1 \exists \vec{x}_2 \forall \vec{x}_3 \ldots \mathsf{Q} \vec{x}_n \varphi(\vec{x}_1,\vec{x}_2,\vec{x}_3,\ldots,\vec{x}_n).\]

<p>
The notations \(\Sigma^0_n\), \(\Pi^0_n\), and \(\Delta^0_n\) are also
standardly used to denote the classes of sets and relations which are
definable by a formula in the corresponding syntactic class. For
instance it follows from the second part of
 <a href="#cesigma1">Proposition 3.8</a>
 that \(\textit{PRIMES}\) is \(\Delta^0_1\) (since it is computable)
and from the first part that \(\HP\) and \(K\) are \(\Sigma^0_1\)
(since they are c.e.). It thus follows that their complements
\(\overline{HP}\) and \(\overline{K}\) are both \(\Pi^0_1\). It is
also not hard to see that \(\TOT\) is \(\Pi^0_2\) as the fact that
\(\phi_x(y)\) is total may be expressed as \(\forall y \exists z
\tau_1(x,y,z)\) by using the arithmetized formulation of the
\(T\)-predicate introduced above. Similarly, \(\textit{FIN}\) is
\(\Sigma^0_2\)-definable since the fact that \(\phi_x(y)\) is defined
for only finitely many arguments is expressible as 
\(\exists u \forall y\forall z(u &lt; y \rightarrow \neg \tau_1(x,y,z))\).</p>

<p>
It is a consequence of the Prenex Normal Form Theorem for first-order
logic that every \(\mathcal{L}_a\)-formula \(\varphi(\vec{y})\) is
provably equivalent to one of the form \(\mathsf{Q}_1 x_1 \mathsf{Q}_2
x_2 \ldots \mathsf{Q}_{n} \varphi(\vec{x},\vec{y})\) for
\(\mathsf{Q}_i \equiv \exists\) or \(\forall\) (e.g., Boolos, Jeffrey,
&amp; Burgess 2007, ch. 19.1). It thus follows that up to provable
equivalence, every such formula is \(\Sigma^0_n\) or \(\Pi^0_n\) for
some \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). Since it is conventional to allow that
blocks of quantifiers may be empty in the
 <a href="#arithhier">Definition 3.15</a>,
 it follows that</p> 

 \[\Sigma^0_n \subseteq \Delta^0_{n+1} \subseteq \Sigma^0_{n+1}\]

<p>
and</p> 

\[\Pi^0_n \subseteq \Delta^0_{n+1} \subseteq \Pi^0_{n+1}.\]

<p>
The fact that these inclusions are strict is a consequence of the
so-called <em>Hierarchy Theorem</em>, a simple form of which may be
stated as follows:</p>

<div class="indent" id="hierthm">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.10</strong> (Kleene 1943): For all \(n \geq 1\),
there exists a set \(A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\) which is
\(\Pi^0_n\)-definable but not \(\Sigma^0_n\)-definable and hence also
neither \(\Sigma^0_m\)- nor \(\Pi^0_m\)-definable for any \(m &lt;
n\). It thus follows that \(\overline{A}\) is \(\Sigma^0_n\)-definable
but not \(\Pi^0_n\)-definable and hence also neither \(\Sigma^0_m\)-
nor \(\Pi^0_m\)-definable for any \(m &lt; n\).</p>
</div>

<p>
It is again possible to prove
 <a href="#hierthm">Theorem 3.10</a>
 by a direct syntactic construction. For instance, building on the
definition of the universal \(\Sigma^0_1\)-predicate
\(\sigma_{k,1}(\vec{y})\), it may be shown that for every level
\(\Sigma^0_n\) of the arithmetical hierarchy, there is a
\(\Sigma^0_n\)-formula \(\sigma_{k,n}(x,\vec{y})\) which defines
\(\Sigma^0_n\)-<em>satisfaction</em> in the standard model in the
sense that </p> 

\[\begin{aligned}
\mathfrak{N} \models \sigma_{k,n}(\ulcorner \varphi(y) \urcorner,\vec{m}) \leftrightarrow \varphi(\vec{m}) \end{aligned}\]

<p>
for all \(\varphi(\vec{x}) \in \Sigma^0_n\) and \(\vec{m} \in
\mathbb{N}^k\) (and where we have also defined our G&ouml;del
numbering to agree with the indexation of \(\Sigma^0_n\)-formulas
introduced above). Now consider the \(\Pi^0_n\)-formula \(\lambda(x) =
\neg \sigma_{2,n}(x,x) \in \Pi^0_n\) and let \(A\) be the set defined
by \(\lambda(x)\). A standard diagonal argument shows that \(A\)
cannot be \(\Sigma^0_n\)-definable and also that if \(\ulcorner
\sigma_{2,n}(x,x) \urcorner = l\) in the enumeration of
\(\Sigma^0_n\)-formulas then \(\neg \sigma_{2,n}(l,l)\) is a
\(\Pi^0_n\)-formula which cannot be provably equivalent to a
\(\Sigma^0_k\)-formula (see, e.g., Kaye 1991: ch. 9.3). Thus as Kleene
(1943, 64) observed, part of the significance of the Hierarchy Theorem
is that it illustrates how the <a href="../liar-paradox/index.html">Liar Paradox</a> may be formalized to
yield a stratified form of Tarski&rsquo;s Theorem on the undefinability of truth
 (see the entry on <a href="../self-reference/index.html#ConSemPar">self-reference</a>).</p>
 
<p>
We may also define a notion of completeness with respect to the levels
of the arithmetical hierarchy as follows: \(A\) is
\(\Sigma^0_n\)-<em>complete</em> if \(A\) is \(\Sigma^0_n\)-definable
and for all \(\Sigma^0_n\)-definable \(B\), we have \(B \leq_m A\)
(and similarly for \(\Pi^0_n\)-<em>complete</em>). It is not hard to
show that in addition to being many-one complete, \(K\) is also
\(\Sigma^0_1\)-complete. Similarly \(\overline{K}\) is
\(\Pi^0_1\)-complete, \(INF\) is \(\Sigma^0_2\)-complete, and \(TOT\)
is \(\Pi^0_2\)-complete. These observations can be subsumed under a
more general result which relates the arithmetical hierarchy to the
Turing degrees and from which
 <a href="#hierthm">Theorem 3.10</a>
 can also be obtained as a corollary.</p>

\(\overline{\emptyset^{(n)}} \in \Pi^0_n - \Sigma^0_n\). This
observation in turn strengthens the Hierarchy Theorem
 (<a href="#hierthm">3.10</a>)
 by showing that \(\Delta^0_n \subsetneq \Sigma^0_n\) and \(\Delta^0_n
\subsetneq \Pi^0_n\) as depicted in Figure 3.</p>

Part iv of

\(B\) and \(\overline{B}\) are computably enumerable in some
\(\Sigma^0_n\)-complete set such as \(\emptyset^{(n)}\). Restricting
to the case \(n = 1\), this observation can also be used to provide an
independent computational characterization of the
\(\Delta^0_2\)-definable sets, extending those given for the
\(\Sigma^0_1\)-definable and \(\Delta^0_1\)-definable sets by

<strong>Definition 3.16:</strong> A set \(A\) is said to be <em>limit
computable</em> if there is a computable sequence of finite sets

\[n \in A \text{ if and only if } \textrm{lim}_s A^s(n) = 1\]

<p>
If \(A\) is c.e., then it is clear that \(A\) is limit computable. For
if \(A\) is the range of a computable function \(\phi_e(x)\), then we
may take \(A^s\) to be \(\{\phi_e(0), \ldots, \phi_e(s)\}\) in which
case \(A^0 \subseteq A^1 \subseteq A^2 \subseteq \ldots\) In the
general case of limit computability, the sequence of sets \(\{A^s : s

which need not grow monotonically in this way but can rather both grow
and shrink as long as there is always a stage \(s\) such that for all
\(s \leq t\), \(n \in A^t\) if \(n \in A\) and \(n \not\in A^t\) if
\(n \not\in A\). Following Putnam (1965), a limit computable set can
also thus also be described as a so-called <em>trial-and-error

by following a guessing procedure which eventually converges to the

<h4 id="AnalHier">3.6.2 The analytical hierarchy</h4>

<p>
Kleene introduced what is now known as the <em>analytical
hierarchy</em> in a series of papers (1955a,b,c) which built directly
on his introduction of the arithmetical hierarchy in (1943). His
proximal motivation was to provide a definability-theoretic
characterization of the so-called <em>hyperarithmetical
sets</em>&mdash;i.e., those which are computable from transfinite
iterates of the Turing jump through the constructive ordinals. On the
other hand, Mostowski (1947) had already noticed similarities between
the arithmetical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers and results
about hierarchies of <em>point sets</em> studied in descriptive set
theory&mdash;i.e., sets of elements of <em>Polish spaces</em>
(complete, separable metrizable spaces such as the real numbers,
Cantor space, or Baire space)&mdash;which have their origins in the
work of Borel, Lebesgue, Lusin, and Suslin in the early twentieth
century. Beginning in his PhD thesis under Kleene, Addison (1954)
refined Mostowski&rsquo;s comparisons by showing that Kleene&rsquo;s
initial work could also be used to provide effective versions of
several classical results in this tradition. We present here the
fundamental definitions regarding the analytical hierarchy
together with some of some results illustrating how it is connected it
to these other developments.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.17:</strong> The <em>language \(\mathcal{L}^2_a\)
of second-order arithmetic</em> extends the language \(\mathcal{L}_a\)
of first-order arithmetic with the binary relation symbol \(\in\),
together with <em>set variables</em> \(X,Y,Z, \ldots\) and set
quantifiers \(\exists X\) and \(\forall Y\). The standard model of
\(\mathcal{L}^2_a\) is the structure \(\langle
\mathbb{N},\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N}),0,&lt;,s,+,\times,\in \rangle\).
The intended range of the set quantifiers is thus
\(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\) (i.e.&nbsp;the power set of
\(\mathbb{N}\)) while the intended interpretation of \(x \in X\) is
that the number \(x \in \mathbb{N}\) is a member of the set \(X\)
where \(X \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Note that in the general case a formula
\(\varphi(x_1,\ldots,x_j,X_1,\ldots, X_k)\) of \(\mathcal{L}^2_a\) may
have both free number variables \(x_1,\ldots, x_j\) and free set
variables \(X_1,\ldots,X_k\). If \(R \subseteq \mathbb{N}^j \times
\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})^k\) is defined by such a formula, then it is
said to be <em>analytical</em>. Kleene (1955a) proved a normal form
theorem for analytical relations which shows that if \(R\) is
analytical then it is definable by an \(\mathcal{L}^2_a\)-formula of
the form </p> 

\[\forall X_1 \exists X_2 \forall X_3 \ldots \mathsf{Q} X_n \psi(X_1,X_2,X_3,\ldots,X_n)\]

<p>
or</p> 

 \[\exists X_1 \forall X_2 \exists X_3 \ldots \mathsf{Q} X_n \psi(X_1,X_2,X_3,\ldots,X_n)\]

<p>
where \(\psi(\vec{X})\) contains only number quantifiers and
\(\mathsf{Q}\) is \(\forall\) or \(\exists\) depending on where
\(n\) is even or odd. It thus possible to classify both
\(\mathcal{L}^2_a\)-formulas and the sets they define into classes as
follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.18:</strong></p>

We denote by both \(\Sigma^1_0\) and \(\Pi^1_0\) the class of
\(\mathcal{L}^2_a\)-formulas containing no set quantifiers (i.e., a
so-called <em>arithmetical formulas</em>). An \(\mathcal{L}^2_a\)
formula is in the class \(\Sigma^1_{n+1}\) if it is of the form
\(\exists X \psi(X)\) where \(\psi \in \Pi^1_n\) and a relation is
\(\Sigma^1_{n+1}\)-<em>definable</em> if it is defined by a
\(\Sigma^1_{n+1}\)-formula. Similarly an \(\mathcal{L}^2_a\)-formula
is in the class \(\Pi^1_{n+1}\) if it is of the form \(\forall X
\psi(X)\) where \(\psi \in \Sigma^1_n\) and a relation is
\(\Pi^1_{n+1}\)-<em>definable</em> if is defined by a
\(\Pi^1_{n+1}\)-formula. A relation is
\(\Delta^1_n\)-<em>definable</em> just in case it is definable by both
a \(\Sigma^1_n\)- and a \(\Pi^1_n\)-formula.</p>
</div>

<p>
It hence follows that, as in the case of the arithmetical hierarchy,
we have</p> 

 \[\Sigma^1_n \subseteq \Delta^1_{n+1} \subseteq \Sigma^1_{n+1}\]

<p>
and</p> 

 \[\Pi^1_n \subseteq \Delta^1_{n+1} \subseteq \Pi^1_{n+1}.\]

<p>
In addition, a version of the Enumeration Theorem for arithmetical
sets can also be proven which can be used to obtain the following
generalization of the Hierarchy Theorem:</p>

<div class="indent" id="hierthm2">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.13</strong> (Kleene 1955a): For all \(n \geq 1\),
there exists a set \(A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\) which is
\(\Pi^1_n\)-definable but not \(\Sigma^1_n\)-definable and hence also
neither \(\Sigma^1_m\)- nor \(\Pi^1_m\)-definable for any \(m &lt;
n\). It thus follows that \(\overline{A}\) is \(\Sigma^1_n\)-definable
but not \(\Pi^1_n\)-definable and also neither \(\Sigma^1_m\)- nor
\(\Pi^1_m\)-definable for any \(m &lt; n\).</p>
</div>

<p>
In order to provide some illustrations of the levels of the analytical
hierarchy, it is useful to record the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Definition 3.19:</strong> A set \(A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\) is
<em>implicitly definable</em> in \(\mathcal{L}^2_a\) just in case
there is an arithmetical formula \(\varphi(X)\) with \(X\) as its sole
free set variable and no free number variables such that \(A\) is the
unique set satisfying \(\varphi(X)\) in the standard model of
\(\mathcal{L}^2_a\).</p>
</div>

<p>
<em>True Arithmetic</em> (\(\textrm{TA}\)) corresponds to the set of
G&ouml;del numbers of first-order arithmetical sentences true in the
standard model of \(\mathcal{L}_a\)&mdash;i.e., \(\textrm{TA} =
\{\ulcorner \varphi \urcorner : \varphi \in \mathcal{L}_a \ \wedge \
\mathfrak{N} \models \varphi\}\). Prior to the definition of the
analytical hierarchy itself, Hilbert &amp; Bernays had already showed
the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.14</strong> (Hilbert and Bernays 1939, &sect;5.2e):
\(\textrm{TA}\) is implicitly definable in \(\mathcal{L}^2_a\).</p>
</div>

<p>
It is then not difficult to show the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.10</strong> (Spector 1955): If \(A\) is
implicitly definable, then \(A\) is \(\Delta^1_1\)-definable in
\(\mathcal{L}^2_a\).</p>
</div>

<p>
It thus follows that \(\textrm{TA}\) is \(\Delta^1_1\)-definable. On
the other hand, it follows from Tarski&rsquo;s Theorem on the undefinability of truth
that \(\textrm{TA}\) is not arithmetically definable&mdash; i.e. \(\textrm{TA} \not\in \Sigma^0_n \cup \Pi^0_n\) for any \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). This in turn shows that the analytical sets
properly extend the arithmetical ones.</p>

<p>
The class of \(\Delta^1_1\)-definable subsets of \(\mathbb{N}\) is
also related to Kleene&rsquo;s original study of the class of
hyperarithmetical sets, customarily denoted \(\textrm{HYP}\). The
definition of \(\textrm{HYP}\) depends on that of a system of
constructive ordinal notations known as \(\mathcal{O} = \langle O,
&lt;_O \rangle\) which Kleene had introduced in (1938). (It was also
in the context of defining \(\mathcal{O}\) in which he proved the
 <a href="#recthm">Recursion Theorem 3.5</a>&mdash;see
 Rogers 1987, ch. 11.7 and Y. Moschovakis 2010.) \(\textrm{HYP}\) can be
informally characterized as the class of sets of natural numbers \(A\)
such that \(A \leq_T \emptyset^{(\alpha)}\) where \(\alpha\) is an
ordinal which receives a notation \(e \in O\)&mdash;i.e., \(A \in
\textrm{HYP}\) just in case it is computable from a transfinite
iteration the of Turing jump up to the first non-recursive ordinal
 \(\omega^{ck}_1\).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup>
 Kleene&rsquo;s original result was as
 follows:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<div class="indent" id="hypthm">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.15</strong> (Kleene 1955b): A set \(A \subseteq
\mathbb{N}\) is \(\Delta^1_1\)-definable if and only if \(A \in
\textrm{HYP}\).</p>
</div>

<p>
The next step up the analytical hierarchy involves the
characterization of the \(\Pi^1_1\)-definable sets. S. Kleene (1955a)
originally established his normal form theorem for
\(\mathcal{L}^2_a\)-formulas using a variant of the language of
second-order arithmetic which contains <em>function quantifiers</em>
\(f,g,h,\ldots\) which are intended to range over \(\mathbb{N}
\rightarrow \mathbb{N}\) instead of set quantifiers intended to range
over \(\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\) (Rogers 1987, ch. 16.2). In this setting,
it is possible to show the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.11:</strong> \(A \in \Pi^1_1\) if and only if
there is a computable (i.e., \(\Delta^0_1\)-definable) relation
\(R(x,f)\) such that </p> 

\[x \in A \text{ if and only if } \forall f \exists yR(x,\overline{f}(y))\]

<p>
where \(\overline{f}(y)\) denotes \(\langle
f(0),\ldots,f(y-1)\rangle\).</p>
</div>

<p>
For each such relation, we may also define a computable tree
\(\textit{Tr}_x\) consisting of the finite sequences \(\sigma \in
\mathbb{N}^{&lt; \mathbb{N}}\) such that for all proper initial
subsequences \(\tau \subset \sigma\), \(\neg R(x,\tau)\) holds. A leaf
node in this tree thus corresponds to the first place for which \(R\)
holds. An infinite path in \(\textit{Tr}_x\) thus
corresponds to a function \(f\) such that \(\forall y \neg
R(x,\overline{f}(y))\), which is in turn a witness to \(x \not\in A\).
It thus follows that \(x \in A\) if and only if \(\textit{Tr}_x\) is
well-founded. Since it is straightforward to effectively enumerate
computable trees, it is also not difficult to show the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.12:</strong> The set \(T\) of indices to
well-founded computable trees is \(m\)-complete for the
\(\Pi^1_1\)-definable sets&mdash;i.e., \(T \in \Pi^1_1\) and for all
\(A \in \Pi^1_1\), \(A \leq_m T\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Recalling that \(O\) denotes the set of natural numbers which are
notations for ordinals in Kleene&rsquo;s \(\mathcal{O}\), a related
result is the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Proposition 3.13:</strong> \(O\) is \(\Pi^1_1\)-complete.</p>
</div>

<p>
It can then be shown using the
 <a href="#hierthm2">Hierarchy Theorem 3.13</a>
 that neither \(T\) nor \(O\) is \(\Sigma^1_1\)-definable. These
results provide the basis for an inductive analysis of the structure
of \(\Delta^1_1\)- and \(\Pi^1_1\)-definable sets in terms of
constructive ordinals which builds on
 <a href="#hypthm">Theorem 3.15</a>
 (see Rogers 1987, ch. 16.4).</p>

<p>
The foregoing results all pertain to the use of
\(\mathcal{L}^2_a\)-formulas to describe sets of natural numbers. The
initial steps connecting the analytical hierarchy to classical
descriptive set theory are mediated by considering formulas
\(\varphi(X)\) which define subclasses \(\mathcal{X} \subseteq
\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})\). In this case, \(A \in \mathcal{X}\) may be
identified with the graph of its characteristic function
\(\chi_A(x)\)&mdash;i.e., as an infinite sequence whose \(n\)th
element is 1 if \(n \in A\) and 0 if \(n \not\in A\). In this way a
formula \(\psi(X)\) with a single free set variable may be understood
as defining a subset of the <em>Cantor space</em> \(\mathcal{C} =
2^{\mathbb{N}}\) consisting of all infinite 0-1 sequences and a
formula \(\psi(\vec{X})\) with \(X_1,\ldots,X_k\) free as defining a
subclass of \(2^{\mathbb{N}} \times \ldots \times
2^{\mathbb{N}}\).</p>

<p>
In descriptive set theory, a parallel sequence of topological
definitions of subclasses of \(\mathcal{C}\) is given in the context
of defining the Borel sets and projective sets. First recall that one
means of defining a topology on \(\mathcal{C}\) is to take as basic
open sets all sets of functions \(f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \{0,1\}\)
such that \(\overline{f}(k) = \sigma\) for some \(\sigma \in 2^{&lt;
\mathbb{N}}\) and \(k \in \mathbb{N}\). The <em>boldface Borel Hierarchy</em> on
\(\mathcal{C}\) is now given by defining \(\mathbf{\Sigma^0_1}\) to be
the collection of all open sets of \(\mathcal{C}\),
\(\mathbf{\Pi^0_{n}}\) (for \(n \geq 1\)) to be the set of all
complements \(\overline{A}\) of sets \(A \in \mathbf{\Sigma^0_1}\),
and \(\mathbf{\Sigma^0_{n+1}}\) to be the set of all countable unions
\(\bigcup_{i \in \mathbb{N}} A_i\) where \(A_i \in \mathbf{\Pi^0_n}\).
(Thus \(\mathbf{\Pi^0_1}\) denotes the set of closed sets,
\(\mathbf{\Sigma^0_2}\) denotes the so-called \(F_{\sigma}\) sets,
\(\mathbf{\Pi^0_2}\) the \(G_{\delta}\) sets, etc.) The union of these
classes corresponds to the <em>boldface Borel sets</em> \(\mathbf{B}\)
which may also be characterized as the smallest class of sets
containing the open sets of \(\mathcal{C}\) which is closed under
countable unions and complementation. The so-called <em>analytic
sets</em> are defined to be the continuous images of the Borel sets
and are denoted by \(\mathbf{\Sigma^1_1}\) while the
<em>co-analytic</em> sets are defined to be the complements of
analytic sets and are denoted by \(\mathbf{\Pi^1_1}\). Finally,
\(\mathbf{\Delta^1_1}\) is used to denote the intersection of the
analytic and co-analytic sets.</p>

<p>
Addison observed (1958, 1959) that these classical definitions can be
effectivized by restricting to computable unions in the definition of
the \(\mathbf{\Sigma^0_n}\) sets. This leads to the so-called
<em>lightface</em> version of the Borel hierarchy&mdash;customarily
denoted using the same notations \(\Sigma^0_n\) and \(\Pi^0_n\) used
for the levels of arithmetical hierarchy&mdash;and corresponding
definitions of \(\Sigma^1_1\) (i.e., lightface analytic), \(\Pi^1_1\)
(i.e., lightface co-analytic), and \(\Delta^1_1\) sets. In particular,
this sequence of definitions suggests an analogy between
 <a href="#hypthm">Theorem 3.15</a>
 and the following classical result of Suslin:</p>

<div class="indent" id="suslinthm">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.16</strong> (Suslin 1917): The class of
\(\mathbf{\Delta}^1_1\) sets is equal to the class of Borel sets
\(\mathbf{B}\).</p>
</div>

<p>
An effective form of
 <a href="#suslinthm">Theorem 3.16</a>
 relating the \(\Delta^1_1\) subsets of \(\mathcal{C}\) to the
lightface Borel sets representable by computable codes can be obtained
from Kleene&rsquo;s original proof of
 <a href="#hypthm">Theorem 3.15</a>
 (see, e.g., Y. Moschovakis 2009, ch. 7B). Addison also showed that it is
similarly possible to obtain an effective version of Lusin&rsquo;s
Theorem (1927)&mdash;i.e., &ldquo;any two disjoint analytic sets can
be separated by a Borel set&rdquo;&mdash;and Kond&ocirc;&rsquo;s
theorem (1939)&mdash;i.e., &ldquo;every \(\mathbf{\Pi^1_1}\)-relation can be uniformized by a \(\mathbf{\Pi^1_1}\)-relation&rdquo;. See
Y. Moschovakis (2009, ch. 2E,4E) and also Simpson (2009, ch. V.3,VI.2)</p>

Historical surveys of the early development of recursive functions and
computability theory are provided by Sieg (2009), Adams (2011), and
Soare (2016, part V). Many of the original sources discussed in
 <a href="#HistBack">&sect;1</a>
 are anthologized in Davis (1965), Heijenoort (1967), and Ewald
(1996). Textbook presentation of computability theory at an elementary
and intermediate level include Hopcroft &amp; Ulman (1979), Cutland (1980), Davis,
Sigal, &amp; Weyuker (1994), and Murawski (1999). The original textbook expositions of the
material presented in
 <a href="#FormRecu">&sect;2</a>
 and
 <a href="#CompTheo">&sect;3</a>
 (up to the formulation of Post&rsquo;s problem) include Kleene
(1952), Shoenfield (1967), and Rogers (1987; first edition 1967). The
structure of the many-one and Turing Degrees is presented in more
advanced textbooks such as Sacks (1963a), Shoenfield (1971), Hinman
(1978), Soare (1987), Cooper (2004), and Soare (2016). In addition to
Shoenfield (1967, ch. 7) and Rogers (1987, ch. 16), the classic treatment of
the hyperarithmetical and analytical hierarchies is Sacks (1990).
Classical and effective descriptive set theory are developed in Y.
Moschovakis (2009, first edition 1980) and Kechris (1995). Simpson
(2009) develops connections between computability theory and
<em>Reverse Mathematics</em>&mdash;i.e., the axiomatic study of
subsystems of second-order arithmetic whose &omega;-models may often be
characterized using computability theoretic methods. Treatment of
sub-recursive hierarchies and connections to proof theory and
theoretical computer science are provided by P&eacute;ter (1967), Rose
(1984), Clote (2002, ch. 6&ndash;7), and Schwichtenberg &amp; Wainer
(2011). Many of the historical and mathematical topics surveyed in
this entry are also presented in greater detail in the two volumes of
Odifreddi&rsquo;s <em>Classical Recursion Theory</em> (1989, 1999a),
which contain many additional historical references.</p>

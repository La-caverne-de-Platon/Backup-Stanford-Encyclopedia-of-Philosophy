<h2>Objections to Generalized 2D Semantics</h2>

<p>
Although empiricists and rationalists invoke the 2D framework for
different explanatory purposes, they agree on three important theses.
First, they defend apriori conceptual truths, which play an important
role in metaphysics. Second, they hold that the 2D framework captures
a kind of meaning. And third, they use the 2D framework to represent a
broadly internalist approach to reference determination. These
positions are distinctive of generalized 2D semantics and all three
are controversial.</p>

<p>
This section will first canvas objections that have been raised
against these shared commitments of G2D. Then we will turn to
objections that have been raised against the rationalist and
empiricist applications of the framework.</p>

<p>
One common complaint about generalized 2D semantics is that there are
no plausible extant analyses of names or natural kind terms, and the
2D framework provides no assurances that an extensionally correct
analysis is possible (e.g., Block and Stalnaker 1999; Byrne and Pryor
2006; Soames 2005). Critics contend that any attempt to provide a
precise definition will be subject to counterexamples: we can imagine
empirical situations where the definition would fail to give the
intuitively correct verdict about the extension. Insofar as this
objection is based exclusively on induction from past failures,
however, it is unconvincing. Generalized 2D semantics is not committed
to any particular analysis, and the correct 2D analysis may be quite
complex. Indeed, the 2D framework allows for &ldquo;analyses&rdquo; in
the form of 1-intensions that cannot be finitely specified in any
natural language. So 2D theorists can simply accept alleged
counterexamples as contributing to the 2D analysis of a term. To
challenge generalized 2D semantics, critics must appeal to broader
theoretical considerations.</p>

<h3>1. Apriority</h3>

<p>
According to G2D, 1-intensions reflect apriori conceptual truths about
the application conditions of ordinary expressions. According to the
Frontloading Argument (Chalmers and Jackson 2001; Chalmers 2012), we
can have conclusive apriori knowledge of material conditionals of the
form \((\PQTI \supset S),\) since all empirical information relevant
to justifying a verdict about S is &ldquo;frontloaded&rdquo; into the
antecedent of the conditional. So information \(E\) about one&rsquo;s
real-world environment plays no essential role in justifying verdicts
about the conditional: either \(E\) is apriori entailed by PQTI or
\(E\) is irrelevant to justifying a verdict about the conditional. So
one&rsquo;s justification for application conditionals is empirically
indefeasible.</p>

<p>
Some advocates of G2D have suggested that we have <em>defeasible</em>,
rather than <em>conclusive</em> apriori access to application
conditionals (Kipper 2012, 39&ndash;40; Biggs &amp; Wilson 2020, 69). But as
Wittmer (2013) points out, defeasible judgments will not suffice to
fix the semantic facts about 1-intensions. And G2D semantics is a
claim about the semantic facts.</p>

<p>
Critics of G2D have challenged the Frontloading Argument and the
apriori status of application conditionals in different ways.</p>

<p>
Many critics insist on the aposteriori status of the <i>initial
patterns of understanding</i> that ground the assignment of
1-intensions. Each element of your initial folk theory of water, for
instance, was originally based on empirical experience and is
epistemically corrigible in the light of further experience. Since
your folk theory is aposteriori, critics argue, verdicts based on that
theory should also count as aposteriori (e.g. Block and Stalnaker
1999; Laurence and Margolis 2003; Nimtz 2004; Byrne and Pryor 2006). A
proponent of G2D might argue that a pattern of understanding acquires
a new apriori status when it functions as an <i>implicit
definition</i> &ndash; a pattern of understanding required for
competence with the same meaning or concept. But critics contend this
way of individuating semantic competence is implausible and begs the
question against sceptics about rationally unrevisable conceptual
truths (Schroeter 2006, 2014; Diaz-Leon 2011, Ebbs 2014). A different
response is Chalmers&rsquo; Bayesian argument (2012), which seeks to
show directly that a high conditional credence \(\cr(S \mid \PQTI)\) is
<i>rationally unrevisable</i>, which in turn supports the apriori
status of \((\PQTI \supset S).\) For criticisms of the dialectical force of
this Bayesian argument, see Pickel and Schulz (2018), Topey (2018), and Heck
(2018). For a formal model of how changes to the relevant conditionals
could be epistemically justified on the basis of empirical evidence
without violating Bayesian principles, see Pickel (2016).</p>

<p>
A second type of challenge to the apriority of application
conditionals focuses on the <i>inferential principles</i> involved in
hypothetical reasoning. Williamson (2007, 2012), Jenkins (2008, 2012),
Neta (2014), and Rupert (2016) argue that the intellectual skills involved in
coming to judgments about hypothetical cases must be honed through
empirical feedback if they are to justify verdicts about hypothetical
cases. So purely hypothetical reasoning still depends for its
justification on empirical experience, even if it is not based on any
empirical premise. See Chalmers 2012, ch. 3.7 for a response. Dowell
(2008) and Melnyk (2008) argue that purely hypothetical reasoning about a
scenario may not reflect the verdicts one would endorse if one were
actually confronted with the relevant scenario &ndash; so hypothetical
reasoning is an empirically fallible guide to the facts about
one&rsquo;s actual dispositions. Braddon-Mitchell (2015) and Chalmers
(2012: 181&ndash;84) construe such errors as a failure of ideal
rationality in hypothetical reasoning. In a different vein, Ball
(2014) suggests that deference to community usage affects virtually all
of our representations &ndash; and as a consequence, they will not
have necessary 1-intensions. Ball uses this conclusion to argue that
E2D cannot explain either Fregean cognitive significance or the
rationalist connection between conceivability and possibility.</p>

<p>
A third type of challenge targets a specific class of concepts &ndash;
demonstrative or recognitional concepts. Critics suggest that the
applicability conditions for these concepts depend essentially on
actually having certain experiences: e.g. having the experience of
seeing that color, or seeing that canary, or seeing a shape
that&rsquo;s similar to an egg (Loar 1990, 1999; Perry 2001; Pryor
2006; Valaris 2009; Yablo 2002, 2006). Apriori reflection on a
possible scenario cannot elicit the relevant experiences, nor can it
establish that you would have the relevant experiences if actually
confronted with the scenario in question. These critics conclude that
apriori reflection alone cannot justify verdicts about the
applicability of this type of concept. For a response to these sorts
of objections, see Chalmers (2002a; 2012: 139&ndash;148; 2014).</p>

<p>
A final type of objection seeks to show that generalized 2D semantics
over-generates apriori truths. For instance, Speaks (2010; 2014)
argues that generalized 2D semantics is committed to the apriority of
contingent facts about the existence of individuals &ndash; a result
that conflicts with commonsense intuitions about what&rsquo;s knowable
apriori. See Elliott, McQueen, and Weber (2013) for a reply. And
Williamson (2006; 2007) argues that there are no conclusively
justifiable conceptual truths, even in the case of conventional kinds
like &lsquo;vixen&rsquo; or logical vocabulary like &lsquo;all&rsquo;.
See Boghossian (2011) for a reply.</p>

<h3>2. Semantic status</h3>

<p>
In order to count as a kind of meaning or conceptual content
1-intensions must be well-defined and they must figure in a plausible
compositional semantics. In addition, the semantic assignments should
reflect commitments about the subject matter picked out. A further
desideratum is that they reflect commitments about stable meanings and
semantic coordination over time and between individuals. Critics have
raised worries about all of these roles.</p>

<p>
Whether 1-intensions are well-defined depends on both there being
semantically stable descriptions of scenarios and stable ways of
evaluating the truth of sentences relative to those descriptions.
Externalist critics challenge the idea of stable descriptive language
for base-level properties like \(P\) and \(Q\) in a PQTI-sentence (e.g.
Stalnaker 2008, Schroeter 2004). And Justin Tiehen (2014) raises an
important worry about defining the &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all&rsquo; clause in
a PQTI-sentence.</p>

<p>
Another important worry is that G2D cannot provide an adequate
compositional semantics. Graeme Forbes (2011) raises a group of puzzle
cases for 2D semantics involving the interaction of factive operators
like &lsquo;someone establishes that&rsquo;, with espistemic and
metaphysical operators like &lsquo;it&rsquo;s apriori that&rsquo; and
&rsquo;it&rsquo;s necessary that&rsquo;. Forbes sees this as a challenge to
any two-factor theory of meaning. See also Soames (2005), Marconi (2005),
and Bealer (2002). In response to Forbes&rsquo; puzzles, Chalmers and Rabern
(2014) argue that the source of the tension is not the 2D semantic
machinery, but rather commonsense commitments about apriority,
necessity and contingent apriori truths. So any semantic theory will
face similar difficulties in reconciling these commitments. See Fritz
(2013), Johannesson and Packal&eacute;n (2016) and Kipper (2017) for
alternative semantic accounts of the puzzle cases that are compatible
with generalized 2D semantics. More recently, Sbardolini (2019) argues
that 1-intentions cannot be coherently negated &ndash; a problem that
he takes to challenge any two-dimensionalist account of meaning.</p>

<p>
Some critics argue that 1-intensions misrepresent the intuitive
subject matter of language and thought. The worry is that generalized
2D semantics entails that one cannot speak or think <i>directly</i>
about individuals or natural kinds (Byrne 2001; Perry 2001, ch. 8;
Soames 2005, ch. 10; 2006a; Stalnaker 2004). In response, proponents
of G2D argue that the second aspect of meaning, the 2-intension, fully
explains these intuitions about the subject matter.</p>

<p>
A different type of objection focuses on semantic competence
conditions. These critics argue that the1-intensions generated for
names and natural kind terms will be too sensitive to idiosyncrasies
in a subject&rsquo;s current understanding to be stable through
reasonable changes in belief or shareable by different members of a
linguistic community (e.g., Block and Stalnaker 1999; Kroon 2004a;
Schroeter 2003; Soames 2005; Stalnaker 2004; Yablo 2000b). Whether
this is a telling objection depends on larger issues about the
explanatory role of meanings&mdash;in particular, to what extent
meanings must be stable through disagreement and theory change. The 2D
account can vindicate some stability, but it will not be able to
vindicate all commonsense epistemic intuitions about sameness of
meaning. For a response to such worries, see Chalmers (2012: ch. 5,
9th excursus).</p>

<h3>3. Internalism</h3>

<p>
Proponents of G2D aim to vindicate an internalist approach to
assigning semantic content to an individual&rsquo;s expressions. Both
the empiricist and the rationalist versions of G2D assign 1-intensions
to words in such a way as to reflect individual speakers&rsquo;
current rational dispositions: 1-intensions are therefore fully
determined by the speaker&rsquo;s current internal states. In
contrast, semantic externalists hold that the aspects of meaning that
1-intensions are intended to explain&mdash;reference determination and
competence conditions&mdash;depend in part on the subject&rsquo;s
relation to external facts, and so cannot be fully determined by the
subject&rsquo;s internal states at a given time.</p>

<p>
Internalism is a deep methodological point of contention that
separates proponents of G2D from many of their critics (e.g., Soames
2005; Stalnaker 2004). Adjudicating this disagreement raises difficult
issues about the explanatory role of semantic theories and how that
role is best fulfilled. Both the empiricist and rationalist projects
privilege individualistic dispositions as explanatorily central. The
empiricist hopes to explain communication in terms of matching
patterns of individual understanding, while the rationalist seeks to
connect individuals&rsquo; apriori judgments to what&rsquo;s
objectively possible. An internalist approach to intentionality is
built into both of these projects (Chalmers and Jackson 2001; Gertler
2002; Braddon-Mitchell 2004). In contrast, semantic externalists tend
to emphasize different explanatory projects: e.g. situating
individuals with respect to objective features of their environment,
explaining semantic coordination despite divergent beliefs, and
vindicating the holistic, falliblist, and open-ended character of
empirical inquiry. These explanatory projects highlight
individuals&rsquo; relation to aspects of their real-world environment
and their fallibility about those relations, and thus naturally
suggest an externalist approach to intentionality. Just which
explanatory projects are most central to intentionality and how the
relevant phenomena are best explained are both hotly contested issues.

<h3>4. The rationalist project</h3>

<p>
Two distinctive aspects of the rationalist project are (1) its
commitment to the modal rationalist thesis that we have apriori access
to the space of metaphysical possibility and (2) its commitment to an
apriori aspect of meaning that can be captured with the 2D modal
framework. Both aspects of the rationalist project have been
challenged by critics.</p>

<h4>4.1 Modal rationalism</h4>

<p>
According to the modal rationalist, if a hypothesis cannot be ruled
out by idealized apriori reflection then it&rsquo;s metaphysically
possible for it to be true. So the space of apriori coherent scenarios
is a failsafe guide to the space of metaphysical possibility. This
thesis is crucial if one hopes to draw metaphysical conclusions on the
basis of apriori conceptual analysis (e.g., the 2D argument against
materialism). Critics have challenged the extensional adequacy of
modal rationalism on the basis of putative counterexamples. The thesis
is also open to more general theoretical challenges.</p>

<p>
Certain examples suggest that a hypothesis can be apriori coherent
even though it&rsquo;s metaphysically impossible for it to be true.
Sometimes a claim and its negation both seem apriori coherent. For
instance, it seems apriori coherent that there could be a necessarily
existing god and that there could be no such god&mdash;but obviously
it&rsquo;s impossible for both of these claims to be true. This
suggests that apriori coherence is a fallible guide to genuine
possibility (Yablo 1999, 2000b Schroeter 2004). Other examples of this
sort include unprovable mathematical necessities and metaphysically
necessary laws of nature. Chalmers (1999; 2002a) argues that all such
alleged counterexamples fail: either they are not apriori coherent
(e.g., necessarily existing beings) or they are not necessary (e.g.,
necessary laws of nature). A different type of counterexample turns on
concepts whose applicability is determined by a subject&rsquo;s
ostensive or recognitional capacities <i>in the actual world</i> (Hill
and McLaughlin 1999; Loar 1999; Perry 2001; Yablo 2002). For instance,
we may recognize ovals by the way they would visually strike us. Since
the applicability of such concepts depends on the <i>actual</i>
exercise of these psychological capacities (whose nature we
don&rsquo;t fully understand), it&rsquo;s impossible to know apriori
whether a certain equation in analytic geometry captures the shape of
ovals. To know this, one must <i>actually</i> <i>see</i> the shapes
generated by the equation (Yablo 2002, &sect;13&ndash;19; 2006). In
response, Chalmers (2002a, &sect;12) argues that the alleged
counterexamples can be accommodated within his 2D framework.</p>

<p>
The underlying rationalist claim that objective metaphysical
possibility is constitutively bound up with ideal rationality is
controversial. Modal conventionalists seek to explain the access to
modal facts by denying their objective status: facts about
what&rsquo;s possible are mere projections of our implicit semantic
rules or psychological dispositions (e.g., Kant 1787; Carnap 1950;
Sidelle 1989). Modal empiricists, in contrast, insist on the
judgment-independent nature of metaphysical facts and deny that we
have apriori access to them: our access to the nature of empirical
objects, kinds, and properties is always based on and corrigible by
experience (e.g., Putnam 1975; Stalnaker 2003; Williamson 2007; Yablo
2000). In contrast, the modal rationalist seeks to vindicate the
objectivity of modal facts by appealing to idealized apriori reasoning
(Descartes 1641; Chalmers 2002a). [See the entry on
 <a href="../modality-epistemology/index.html">the epistemology of modality</a>.]</p>
 
<h4>4.2 The Core Thesis</h4>

<p>
Even if one rejects modal rationalism, the semantic rationalist
insists that epistemic 2D semantics may capture an important aspect of
meaning that connects meaning, apriority, and the space of epistemic
possibility. A crucial criterion of adequacy for this project is to
provide a way of interpreting the 2D framework that satisfies the
rationalist&rsquo;s Core Thesis:</p>

<p class="indent">
Core Thesis: For any \(S\), \(S\) is apriori iff its epistemic
intension is necessary.</p>

<p>
Some critics have sought to show that epistemic 2D semantics cannot
satisfy this constraint. The problem is that epistemic intensions are
assigned on the basis of the speaker&rsquo;s commonsense standards for
evaluating the apriori coherence of combining the target sentence with
a description of a scenario. But commonsense standards may presuppose
that the speaker, her words, or her thoughts exist <i>within</i> the
hypothetical scenario. If so, the epistemic approach will run into
similar problems to those that plagued the contextualist approach: the
necessity of the epistemic intension will not line up with genuine
epistemic or metaphysical
 necessity.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup>
 This sort of objection has been pressed in different ways by Yablo

<h3>5. The empiricist project</h3>

<p>
Criticisms of the empiricist use of 2D semantics to explain linguistic
coordination can be divided into two broad categories: (i) criticisms
that target the account of linguistic conventions, and (ii) criticisms
that target the account of individuals&rsquo; linguistic
understanding.</p>

<p>
The empiricist account of linguistic conventions has elicited the most
criticism. On this account, A-intensions capture the content of tacit
linguistic conventions of the sort outlined by Lewis (1969). If this
is right, then the reference-fixing conditions for words like
&lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;, &lsquo;water&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Barack
Obama&rsquo; must meet two strong empirical constraints:</p>

<ol>

<li>All (or almost all) speakers in a community must associate the
very same reference-fixing condition with the term.</li>

<li>This convergence must be mutually obvious to all (or almost all)
speakers.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Both assumptions have been challenged. On the first point: Most
philosophers acknowledge that competent English speakers can have
entirely different criteria for identifying the reference of a proper
name like &lsquo;Barack Obama&rsquo; and many acknowledge significant
variability in competent speakers&rsquo; initial understanding of
natural kind terms like &lsquo;water&rsquo;: we don&rsquo;t need to
share precisely the same &ldquo;folk theory&rdquo; of Obama or of
water in order to be linguistically competent with those terms (e.g.,
Burge 1979; Kripke 1980; Quine 1951a). To back up this intuitive
point, experimental philosophers have marshalled survey data to argue
that English speakers from different ethnic or socio-economic
backgrounds classify hypothetical cases, such as Gettier cases or Twin
Earth cases, differently. [See the entry on
 <a href="../experimental-philosophy/index.html#ArguDive">experimental philosophy</a>].
 In response to such worries, Jackson acknowledges that different
speakers&rsquo; criteria for applying a term may not be perfectly
matched, but he argues that there must be significant overall
similarity in reference-fixing criteria for everyday practical
coordination. Empiricist 2D semantics is meant to explain this
imperfect similarity (1998b, 214&ndash;5). See also Lewis (1997), who
posits higher-order similarities among speakers&rsquo;
reference-fixing commitments. On the second point: critics (Kroon
2004a; Schroeter 2003) challenge 2D empiricist&rsquo;s assumption of
common knowledge of reference-fixing conditions, arguing that speakers
are not in a position to know the range of variation and similarity in
speakers&rsquo; understanding of a term within their linguistic
community. If this is right, then tacit linguistic conventions cannot
get off the ground: if speakers don&rsquo;t know what the standard
linguistic practices are, they cannot be expected to conform to those
standards. In response, an empiricist may claim that communal
standards will inevitably involve some indeterminacy.</p>

<p>
The second distinctive aspect of the empiricist account of meaning is
the idea that individual speakers have <i>implicit knowledge</i> of
reference-fixing conditions. This model of linguistic understanding
can be challenged in two different ways. First, there is the
psychological claim that competent speakers have something like an
internal reference-fixing template&mdash;a stable set of criteria for
identifying the reference that guides the application of the term both
in everyday use and in hypothetical reasoning. Some critics argue that
individuals&rsquo; judgments about cases are more plausibly explained
without positing any such stable template (Schroeter 2006; Schroeter
and Bigelow 2009). Second, there is the semantic claim that a
speaker&rsquo;s everyday criteria determine the real reference of her
words. The semantic claim is challenged by theorists working in a
broadly Quinean tradition. Such critics argue that the reference of
someone&rsquo;s word is determined <i>not</i> by the speaker&rsquo;s
settled dispositions to apply a word to cases, but by how these
criteria should be refined in light of empirical facts about the
speaker&rsquo;s environment so as to meet broader theoretical and
practical interests associated with the speaker&rsquo;s use of the
word (Block and Stalnaker 1999; Schroeter 2003; Williamson 2007; Yablo
2000a, 2000b). While 2D empiricists can acknowledge that refinements
of the subject&rsquo;s current conception are important, they will
insist that refinements that depart from na&iuml;ve understanding
(such as a compatibilist conception of free will) constitute a change
of meaning. The 2D empiricist thus advocates the sort of position
articulated by Carnap (1950), while critics champion views closer to
those of Quine (1951a, 1951b) or Putnam (1974).</p>

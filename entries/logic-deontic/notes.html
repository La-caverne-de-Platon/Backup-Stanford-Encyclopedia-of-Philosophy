<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Deontic Logic</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 The term &ldquo;<em>deontic</em> logic&rdquo; appears to have arisen
in English as the result of C. D. Broad&rsquo;s suggestion to von
Wright (von Wright 1951a); Mally used &ldquo;Deontik&rdquo; earlier to
describe his work (Mally 1926). Both terms derive from the Greek term,
<span>&delta;&epsilon;&omicron;&nu;</span>, for &ldquo;that which is
binding&rdquo;, and <span>&iota;&kappa;</span>, a common Greek
adjective-forming suffix for &ldquo;after the manner of&rdquo;,
&ldquo;of the nature of&rdquo;, &ldquo;pertaining to&rdquo;,
&ldquo;of&rdquo;, thus suggesting roughly the idea of a logic of duty.
(The intervening &ldquo;<span>&tau;</span>&rdquo; in
&ldquo;<span>&delta;&epsilon;&omicron;&nu;&tau;&iota;&kappa;</span>&rdquo;
is inserted for phonetic reasons.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 To be sure, some of these notions (e.g., &ldquo;ought&rdquo;) have
received more attention in deontic logic than others. However,
virtually everyone working in this area would see logical systems
designed to model the logical contributions of these notions as part
of deontic logic proper.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

 We will assume the reader is at least familiar with classical
proposition logic for this entry.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#CondObliChisPuzz">Section 4</a> can itself be seen as the first and most well-known
expansion on the approaches in Sections 1&ndash;3.</p>

 For brevity, supplements like this one to Mally are occasionally used
to provide additional info of value that is not central to
understanding the point in the text. Footnotes are for more minor
asides, such as short proofs; but also for often annotated
bibliographical paragraphs associated with a topic.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 In keeping with wide practice in logic over the past century or so,
we will treat both modal notions and deontic notions as sentential (or
propositional) operators unless otherwise stated. Although it is
controversial whether the most fundamental (if there are such) modal
and deontic notions have the logical form of propositional operators,
focusing on these forms allowed for essentially seamless integration
of these logics with propositional logics (especially classical
truth-functional logic). </p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 The color-coded key indicated will be relied on throughout for
similar diagrams. Propositions are said to be <em>contraries</em> if
they can&rsquo;t both be true, <em>sub-contraries</em> if they
can&rsquo;t both be false, and <em>contradictories</em> if they always
have opposing truth-values. The arrows, indicate proper entailment (if
the arrow&rsquo;s source is true, then so is its destination, but not
necessarily the reverse). So for example, the square implies that no
proposition is both necessarily and impossible, and a necessary
proposition is possible, and possible if and only not impossible. The
square can be easily augmented as a hexagon by including nodes for
contingency. Cf. the deontic hexagon below.</p>

 For some deontic schemes in Islamic thought, see for example Carney
1983, Reinhart 1983, Hourani 1985, and more recently, Rahman et al.
2019, Rahman et al. forthcoming.</p>

 Deontic operators will appear with an initial boldface letter. These
abbreviations are not standard. &ldquo;O&rdquo; is routinely used
instead of &ldquo;\(\OB\)&rdquo;, and &ldquo;O&rdquo; is often read as
&ldquo;It ought to be the case that&rdquo;, &ldquo;P&rdquo; is used
instead of &ldquo;\(\PE\)&rdquo;, and if used at all, &ldquo;F&rdquo;
(for &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo;) is used instead of &ldquo;\(\IM\)&rdquo;
and &ldquo;I&rdquo; (for &ldquo;indifference&rdquo;) is used instead
of &ldquo;\(\OP\)&rdquo;. Deontic non-necessity, here denoted by
&ldquo;\(\OM\)&rdquo; is seldom labeled, and likewise for
non-optionality. The double letter choices used here are easy
mnemonics expressing <em>all six</em> basic conditions, and they will
facilitate later discussion involving just what notions to take SDL
and kin to be modeling, and how it might be enriched to handle other
related normative notions. Both deontic logic and ethical theory are
fraught with difficulties when it comes to interchanging allegedly
equivalent expressions for one another. Here we choose to read the
primitive operator as &ldquo;it is obligatory that&rdquo; so that all
continuity with permissibility, impermissibility, and optionality is
retained. &ldquo;It is obligatory that&rdquo; may also be read
personally, but non-agentially as &ldquo;it is obligatory <em>for
Jones</em> that&rdquo;. (See Krogh &amp; Herrestad 1996 and McNamara
2004a. We will return to these issues again in
 <a href="index-2.html#DeonLogiAgen">Section 5.2</a>.</p>
 </div>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 In this essay we will slough over the distinction between
abbreviational definitions of operators not officially in the formal
language, and axiom systems with languages containing these operators,
and axioms directly encoding the force of such definitions as
equivalences.</p>

 See Hruschka 1990, Tierney 2007, Johns 2014 on the modern period.
Islamic thought embraced TTC as far back as the eleventh century,
since TTC is clearly entailed by a more fine-grained five-fold
partition embraced in Islamic thought. See for example, the second
section of Hilpinen and McNamara 2013 and some references there.</p>

 Likewise for adding contingency and non-contingency to the modal
square. For important new work on developing theories generalizing
squares of opposition and oppositional relations, see for example
Moretti 2004 and B&eacute;ziau &amp; Payette 2012, B&eacute;ziau 2012,
and the many references there, as well as the conference series

 The logic of Mally 1926 was saddled with the T-analog above. Mally
reluctantly embraced it since it followed from premises that seemed
faultless to him. See the entry on
 <a href="../mally-deontic/index.html">Mally&rsquo;s deontic logic</a>.</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 In a monadic system one can easily <em>define</em> dyadic deontic
operators <em>of sorts</em> Hintikka 1971. For example, we might
define &ldquo;deontic implication&rdquo; as \(\OB (p \rightarrow q)\)
. We will consider non-monadic systems in
 <a href="index-2.html#CondObliChisPuzz">Section 4</a>.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 Note that this axiomatization, and all others here, use &ldquo;axiom
schemata&rdquo;: schematic specifications by syntactic pattern of
classes of axioms (rather than particular axioms generalized via a
substitution rule). We will nonetheless slough over the distinction
here and often refer to such schemes as just &ldquo;axioms&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Compare the rule that contradictions are not permissible: if \(\vdash
\neg p\) then \(\vdash \neg \PE p\). \(\OB\)-NEC is often said to be
equivalent to &ldquo;not everything is permissible&rdquo;, and thus to
rule out only &ldquo;normative systems&rdquo; that have no normative
force at all.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 SDL is a normal modal logic often called &ldquo;D&rdquo; (for
&ldquo;Deontic&rdquo;) or &ldquo;KD&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;No
Conflicts&rdquo; axiom, NC, is often referred to as the &ldquo;D
axiom&rdquo;, in the context of normal modal logics, the
characteristic axiom of system D.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 \(\OB\)-OD should not be confused with NC. \(\OB\)-OD asserts that no
single logical contradiction can be obligatory, whereas NC asserts
that there can no (binary) deontic conflicts.</p>

 Widely endorsed as indicated in the prior historical references where
TDS is endorsed, along with either of these three: NC itself, or TTC,
or the DS, and something like RE is presupposed. As we&rsquo;ve just
seen, anyone of these three commits one to the others once RE and TDS
are endorsed. That the resulting logic is only a fragment is easy to
show using neighborhood semantics (see
 <a href="index-2.html#RejeCorePrinSDLOBNECOBRM">Section 6.3</a>
 for a sketch.). The Standard Semantics for SDL is too strong. See
Chellas 1980 for examples of the sort of proof needed to show this
&ldquo;only a fragment&rdquo; claim semantically.</p>

 K is the basic (weakest) normal modal logic. (See Chellas 1980, or
the entry
 <a href="../logic-modal/index.html">modal logic</a>.)
 Traditionally, and in keeping with the intended interpretation of
modal operators when employed for the reduction, the underlying modal
logic had T as a theorem, indicating that necessity is here
truth-implicating. We begin with K instead because T generates a
system <em>stronger</em> than SDL. We will look at the addition of T
shortly. &Aring;qvist 2002 is an excellent source on the meta-theory
of the relationship between SDL-ish deontic logics and corresponding
Andersonian-Kangerian modal logics, as well as the main dyadic
(primitive conditional operator) versions of these logics. Smiley 1963
is a landmark in the comparative study of such deontic systems.</p>

 First consider the very simple proof of a mixed formula \(\OB d\): By
PC, we have \(d \rightarrow d\) as a theorem. Then by NEC, it follows
that \(\Box(d \rightarrow d)\), that is, \(\OB d\). Next consider a
proof of a key formula of SDL, NC, \(\OB p \rightarrow \neg \OB \neg
p\). As usual, in proofs with deontic operators, we make free use of
the rules and theorems that carry over from the normal modal logic K.
For reductio, assume \(\neg(\OB p \rightarrow \neg \OB \neg p)\), that
is, </p> 

 \[\neg(\Box(d\rightarrow p) \rightarrow \neg \Box(d\rightarrow \neg p)).\]

<p>
So </p> 

\[\Box(d \rightarrow p) \amp \Box(d \rightarrow \neg p).\]

<p>
and then from the modal logic K, \(\Box(d \rightarrow(p \amp \neg
p))\) follows. But then along with \(\Diamond d, \Diamond(p \amp \neg
p)\) follows in modal logic K. Yet it is a theorem of K that \(\neg
\Diamond(p \amp \neg p)\), so we get a contradiction.</p>

 Scare quotes because <em>Kant&rsquo;s</em> law is more accurately
rendered as involving agency (if Doe is obligated to bring something
about then Doe is able to do so), but the label is often used in

 Note that this means that, for generality, we assume that what is
possible may vary from one world to another. This is standard in this
sort of semantics for modal logics. For example, if we wanted to model
physical possibility and necessity, what is physically possible for
our world, may not be so for some other logically possible world with
different fundamental physical laws than ours. By adding certain
constraints, we can generate a picture where what is possible does not
vary at all from one world to another. See the entry on

 Note that we could add an ordering-relation semantics like that
described at the end of
 <a href="index-2.html#StanDeonLogi">Section 2</a>
 in order to generate the DEM component of these models. The main
difference would be that instead of a set of world-relative ordering
relations, one for each world (e.g., \(\ge_i )\) there would be just
one ordering relation, \(\ge\), whereby all worlds in W (in a given
model) would be ranked just once. This relation would be reflexive,
transitive and connected, while satisfying the limit assumption in W.
DEM would then be the set of all the best worlds in W, and then the
truth conditions for \(d\) and the six deontic operators would be cast
via DEM so generated.</p>

<div id="note-43">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-43">43.</a>
 More explicitly, since \(\OB p \eqdf \Box(d \rightarrow p)\), we need
only look at \(\Box(d \rightarrow p)\). The latter will be true at a
world \(i\), iff \((d \rightarrow p)\) is true at all the
\(i\)-accessible worlds. But given the truth-conditions for the
material conditional &ldquo;\(\rightarrow\)&ldquo;, that just amounts
to saying \(p\) is true at all those \(i\)-accessible worlds (if any)
where \(d\) is true, which in turn holds iff \(p\) is true at all the
\(i\)-accessible worlds falling within DEM, i.e., at their
intersection (which is non-empty by strong seriality). Similarly for
the other deontic operators.</p>

 A more dramatic case is the Gentle Murderer Paradox (Forrester 1984),
which concerns the obligation to kill gently, in case one will violate
the obligation to not kill at all. Prakken and Sergot 1996 presented a
famous variant that avoids temporal or agential solutions to the
contrary-to-duty paradox, involving stative obligations for a housing
community: there is a dog; it is obligatory that there not be a dog;
if there is a dog, it is obligatory that there be a &ldquo;beware of
dog&rdquo; sign. A forerunner of CTDs is the &ldquo;paradox of derived
obligation/commitment&rdquo; Prior 1954.</p>

 Von Wright 1956 takes the now-classic non-componential dyadic
operator approach to the syntax of CTDs. Danielsson 1968; B. Hansson
1969 [1971]; Lewis 1973, 1974; and Feldman 1986 provide samples of a
&ldquo;next best thing&rdquo; approach: the interpretation of
conditional obligations via a primitive non-componential dyadic
operator, in turn interpreted via a preference ordering of the
possible worlds where the (perhaps obligation-violating) antecedent
holds; see also &Aring;qvist 1987, 2002 for extensive systematic
presentations of this sort of approach, and al-Hibri 1978 for an early
widely-read systematic discussion of a number of approaches to CTDs.
van Fraassen 1972; Loewer &amp; Belzer 1983; and Jones &amp; P&ouml;rn
1985 also offer influential discussions of CTDs and propose distinct
formal solutions. Tomberlin 1981 contains a very influential informal
discussion of various approaches to conditional obligations.
&Aring;qvist &amp; Hoepelman 1981, and Van Eck 1982 (and again, Loewer
&amp; Belzer 1983) are classic representatives of attempts to solve
the puzzle by incorporating temporal notions into deontic logic. Jones
1990 contains an influential argument against any temporal-based
general solution to the puzzle. Casta&ntilde;eda 1981 argued that by
carefully distinguishing between (very roughly) propositions and
actions in the scope of deontic operators, Chisholm&rsquo;s puzzle, as
well as most puzzles for deontic logic, can be resolved; Meyer 1988
offers a version of this general approach using dynamic logic. Prakken
&amp; Sergot 1996 contains an influential argument against any such
action-based general solution to the puzzle. For later work on CTDs in
the context of a branching time framework with agency represented a la
Horty-Belnap, see Horty 1996, Bartha 1999, and Bartha&rsquo;s
contribution (chapter 11) to Belnap et al. 2001. A recent source that
reviews a good deal of the literature on CTDs and proposes its own
solution is Carmo &amp; Jones 2002; but see also material on this
problem in Nute 1997. See also Saint Croix &amp; Thomason 2014, which
argues that there are a set of puzzles, not all involving conditionals
for Chisholm&rsquo;s case, and Cariani Forthcoming, which discusses
more recent approaches to the Chisholm puzzle, especially those in the
philosophy of deontic language.</p>

 Alchourr&oacute;n 1993 is a salient exception to this approach. More
recently, Van De Putte, Frijters, &amp; Meheus 2018 introduced a logic

unconditional obligations&rdquo; are independent of &ldquo;obligations

 Smith 1994 notes that adding factual detachment to SDL with \(\OB

Mally&rsquo;s problem: \(\vdash \OB p \leftrightarrow p\). Smith,
crediting Andrew Jones, shows that already in PC, \(\OB\)-D,
\(\OB\)-RE, and FD yields \(\OB p \rightarrow p\), which is still
enough to make Voltaire, who chastised Leibniz for claiming this was
the best of all possible words, grin. Clearly a non-material
conditional is essential here.</p>

 Mott 1973 and Chellas 1974 (and Chellas 1980), and Thomason 1981b are
early advocates for analyses of the puzzle that combine a
<em>non-material</em> conditional and a <em>unary</em> deontic
operator to form a genuine componential compound, \(p \Rightarrow \OB
q\), for representing conditionals like (3) above. DeCew 1981 is an
important early critical response to this sort of approach. Tomberlin
1981 contains an influential informal discussion of various
approaches. Bonevac 1998 argues against taking conditional obligation
to be a primitive non-componential dyadic operator, suggesting roughly
that techniques like those developed in AI (e.g., Brewka 1989) for
defeasible reasoning suffice for handling woes with CTDs. Smith (1993,
1994) stresses the difference between violability and defeasibility,
and the relevance of the former rather than the latter to CTDs. </p>

 In Benthem, Grossi, &amp; Liu 2014, it is shown how Hansson-style
deontic operators are definable in a richer language featuring normal
modal operators that talk about &ldquo;what is true at all worlds at
least as good as the present one&rdquo;. There, detachment is modeled
as a dynamic operation: the formula \(\OB (p\mid q) \rightarrow[!q]\OB
p\) expresses that, if \(p\) is obligatory conditional on \(q\), then
a public announcement of \(q\) makes \(p\) obligatory simpliciter. See

 Jones &amp; P&ouml;rn 1986 is an early attempt to distinguish the two
formally, although &ldquo;must&rdquo; ends up modeled as

all accessible scenarios&mdash;permissible or not) rather than
<em>deontic</em> necessity (that which holds in all permissible
scenarios). McNamara 1990 provides the first model-theoretic
representation of deontic &ldquo;must&rdquo; and &ldquo;ought&rdquo;,
as well as a cumulative case argument that &ldquo;must&rdquo; not
&ldquo;ought&rdquo; is the dual of permissibility, and thus that it is
this almost universally ignored term &ldquo;must&rdquo;, not
&ldquo;ought&rdquo;, that tracks the traditional concern in ethical
theory and deontic logic with permissibility. See also McNamara

 More generally, it can be seen as a reduction of an agential deontic

1996; Belnap et al. 2001. Herrestad &amp; Krogh 1993 reinterpret the
analysis so that the deontic operator is <em>personal</em> (rather
than impersonal) yet not agential. This is arguably a more plausible
way to preserve a componential analysis of agential obligation
(McNamara 2004a). Horty 2001 provides an alternative non-componential
analysis of agential obligation in the context of a branching-time
analysis of agency. This is in contrast to the branching-time approach
to deontic contexts in Belnap et al. 2001 (with Paul Bartha), where
agential obligation is a componential compound of an agency operator
and an obligation operator (one in turn analyzed via an
Andersonian-Kangerian reduction). Another alternative to the major
trend above, is the adaptation of modal logics for representing
computer programs (e.g., dynamic logic) to represent actions in
deontic logic. Since this deviates from SDL more than adding to it,
this is covered further below. See also Segerberg 1992 for coverage

 The theory of normative positions has been an important and active
sub-area of deontic logic since its inception in Stig Kanger&rsquo;s
work Kanger 1957 [1971], 1972, Kanger &amp; Kanger 1966 [1972], further
developed in a book-length study by Lars Lindahl (1977), and thus
sometimes referred to as &ldquo;the Kanger-Lindahl theory&rdquo;. It
has been used in attempts to analyze legal relations, like those made
famous by Hohfeld 1919, among other things. The Kanger-Lindahl theory
has been further developed by Makinson 1986; Jones &amp; Sergot 1993;
Sergot 1999, 2013; Herrestad &amp; Krogh 1995; Lindahl 2001. See also
Allen 1996 for a somewhat different approach to Hohfeldian legal
relations, and P&ouml;rn 1970, 1977 for a framework employed to
analyze various normatively laden social positions and relations.
Lindahl 2001 provides an excellent overview and orientation on
Kanger&rsquo;s work in this area, and various problems informing
subsequent research. (Other seminal contributions of Kanger to deontic
logic are discussed in Hilpinen 2001b in the same volume.) Sergot
1999, 2013 takes the formal work of normative positions to a new level
of abstraction and precision. The later work mentioned above by
Lindahl, Herrestad, and Krogh, continue the exploration of refinements
of the earlier Kanger-Lindahl conceptual framework to adapt it better
to the analysis of legal notions. More recently Dong &amp; Roy 2017
provides a first attempt at modeling the dynamics of normative
powers.</p>

 For Horty&rsquo;s reasoning to work here, it is important that the

decision under risk. In other words, it does not make sense (for the

 The converse can also easily be shown: suppose that by gambling, the
agent risks a loss of 5$, but the agent cannot make any gains. There
is however a possibility that the agent still keeps his money when
gambling. Then intuitively, we would say the agent ought not to
gamble. However, on the Meinong-Chisholm analysis this is false, since
there is a &ldquo;best&rdquo; world (i.e., one in which the agent
luckily keeps his money) in which the agent does gamble.</p>

performative utterances generally work this way Kempson 1977. For
example, if a marriage ceremony conducted by a legitimate authority
requires that authority to end the ceremony with the proverbial
(albeit dated) &ldquo;You are now husband and wife&rdquo; in order to
complete an act of marriage, the speech act utilizing this sentence
not only marries the couple (in the context), but it appears to also

 Of course, there are meta-normative accounts (e.g., realist and some
constructivist accounts) that would not require a system of norms to
have arisen for something to be required (e.g., ethically,
prudentially, rationally, or epistemically required), but in many
cases, by any account, some requirements will be based on such
normative systems (e.g., legal norms, municipal regulations,
etiquette, rules for games). For the latter, it would seem the
normative propositions derive from a set of norms, and then might not
their logic need to do so as well?</p>

principles such as &ldquo;if action a necessarily results in a state
of affairs that is forbidden, then action a is also forbidden.&rdquo;

 Von Wright 1951a notes that since the denial of \(\neg \OB\top\) is
provably equivalent to \(\PE\bot\) (given the traditional definitional
scheme and \(\OB\)-RE), and since both \(\OB\top\) and \(\PE\bot\) are
odd, we should opt for a &ldquo;principle of contingency&rdquo;, which
says that \(\OB\top\) and \(\PE\bot\) are both logically contingent.
Von Wright 1963 argues that \(\OB\top\) (and \(\PE\)\top) do not
express real prescriptions (pp.152-4). F&oslash;llesdal &amp; Hilpinen
1971 suggests that excluding \(\OB\)-N only excludes
&ldquo;<em>empty</em> normative systems&rdquo; (i.e., normative
systems with no obligations), and perhaps not even that, since no one
can fail to fulfill \(\OB\top\) anyway, so why worry, cf. Prior 1958.
However, since it is dubious that anyone can bring it about that
\(\top\), it would seem to be equally dubious that anyone can
&ldquo;fulfill&rdquo; \(\OB\top\), and thus matters are not so simple.
al-Hibri 1978 discusses various early takes on this problem, rejects
\(\OB\)-N, and later develops a deontic logic without it. Note that
similar observations can be coined in terms of
&ldquo;violations&rdquo;, a notion central to CTDs. Von Wright 1963
comes close to endorsing violability as essential to any obligation
(1963: 154), but the context there is more complex and less
straightforward. Jones &amp; P&ouml;rn 1985 explicitly rejects
\(\OB\)-N for &ldquo;ought&rdquo;, taking violability to be essential
to what people ought to do.</p>

 Prior cast it using this variant of RM: If \(\vdash p \rightarrow q\)
then \(\vdash \IM q \rightarrow \IM p\) (the impermissibility of Smith
being robbed then appears to wrongly imply the impermissibility of
helping him who has been robbed). See also &Aring;qvist 1967, which
has been very influential.</p>

 This paradox can also be cast equivalently with just one agent, and
via \(\IM\) as easily as \(\OB\): &ldquo;The Victims Paradox&rdquo;
notes that the victim of the crime helps herself only if there was a
crime. If it is impermissible that there be a crime, it will follow
under similar symbolization that it is impermissible for the victim of
the crime to help herself, which hardly sounds right. Similarly for
&ldquo;The Robber&rsquo;s (Repenter&rsquo;s) Paradox&rdquo;, where now
we focus on the robber making amends (or repenting) for his crime, and
again we seem to get the result that it is impermissible for the
robber to make amends for his crime, suggesting a rather convenient
argument against all obligations to ever make amends for one&rsquo;s
crimes. These early variations were used to show that certain
initially proposed solutions to the Good Samaritan paradox
didn&rsquo;t really solve the problem. Both versions are found in
Nowell-Smith &amp; Lemmon 1960.</p>

 Jackson 1985 argues for an approach to &ldquo;ought to be&rdquo; that
links it to counterfactuals, and he informally explores its semantics
and logic; Goble 1990a makes a similar case for &ldquo;good&rdquo; and
&ldquo;bad&rdquo; (as well as &ldquo;ought&rdquo;), formally tying
these to logical features of counterfactuals explicitly. Goble 1990b
contains the main technical details and axiomatization of this
approach.</p>

 Interestingly, the debate on the validity of RM also intersects with
the issue of &ldquo;actualism&rdquo; and &ldquo;possibilism&rdquo; as
these terms are used in ethical theory. Roughly, <em>possibilism</em>
is the view that I ought to bring about \(p\) if \(p\) is part of the
best overall outcome I <em>could</em> bring about, even if the
goodness of this overall outcome, depends on all sorts of other things
that I <em>would</em> not in fact bring about, were I to bring about
\(p\). In contrast, <em>actualism</em> is the view that I ought to
bring about \(p\) if doing so <em>would</em> in fact be better than
not doing so, and this of course can crucially depend on what else I
would do (ideal or not) were I to bring about \(p\). (For more, see

conflicts of obligation.</p>

 Whether or not these obligations are both
all-things-considered-non-overridden obligations is a further issue,
to which we return below. For our purposes here, the point is that
they appear to be obligations.</p>

 Since it seems clear that obligations can conflict, SDL can&rsquo;t
represent the general notion of an obligation. It is perhaps better to
assume that any logic containing NC requires a qualified reading of
\(\OB\), such as &ldquo;it is <em>overridingly obligatory</em> that
\(p\)&rdquo;. NC appears to be <em>analytic</em> if we read the
operator this way.</p>

 Lemmon 1962a stresses that a conflict of obligations does not entail
a contradiction. Williams 1965 stresses the contingency of conflicts
of obligation and contrasts this in passing with inconsistency as
unrealizability in any world. Marcus 1980 stresses more explicitly the
standard world-theoretic conception of consistency, and applies it to
moral codes whereby a code&rsquo;s consistency entails only that there
is <em>some</em> eligible world where the code is obeyable, and that
this by no means entails that the code must be obeyable in
<em>all</em> eligible worlds Marcus 1996.</p>

 Here too we change the example. Plato&rsquo;s case involves returning
a weapon as promised to someone who now in a rage intends to unjustly
kill someone with the weapon. Lemmon interprets the issues raised by
Sartre&rsquo;s dilemma a bit differently than we do here.</p>

 Von Wright 1968 suggested that minimizing evil is a natural approach
to conflict resolution, thereby suggesting that a sort of minimizing
(and thus reliance on an ordering) is apt. Alchourr&oacute;n &amp;
Makinson 1981 provide an early formal analysis of conflict resolution
via partial orderings of regulations and regulation sets. Chisholm
1964, 1974 have been very influential conceptually (as witnessed, for
example, by Loewer &amp; Belzer 1983); that work is analyzed
extensively in McNamara Forthcoming. In ethical theory, the informal
conceptual landmark is W. D. Ross 1939. Horty 1994 is a very
influential discussion forging a link between Reiter&rsquo;s default
logic developed in AI (see Brewka 1989), and an early influential
approach to conflicts of obligation, van Fraassen 1973, which combines
a preference ordering with an imperatival approach to deontic logic.
In Horty 2012, this idea is worked out much more detail. Prakken 1996
discusses Horty&rsquo;s approach and an alternative that strictly
separates the defeasible component from the deontic component, arguing
that handling conflicts should be left to the former component only.
See also Makinson 1993 for a discussion of defeasiblity and the place
of deontic conditionals in this context. Other approaches to
defeasibility in deontic logic that have affinities to semantic
techniques developed in artificial intelligence for modeling
defeasible reasoning about defeasible conditionals generally are Asher
&amp; Bonevac 1996, 1997 and Morreau 1996, all of which attempt to
represent W. D. Ross-like notions of <em>prima facie</em> obligation,
etc. Note that Alchourr&oacute;n 1996; Prakken 1996; Asher &amp;
Bonevac 1996; and Morreau 1996 are all found in a special issue of
<em>Studia Logica</em> (57(1) 1996, guest edited by Andrew J. I. Jones
and Marek Sergot). Nute 1997 is dedicated to defeasibility in deontic
logic with articles by many of the key players, including Nute
himself. See Bartha 1999 for an approach to contrary-to-duty
conditionals and to defeasible conditionals layered over a branching
time framework with an agency operator. Smith 1994 contains an
interesting informal discussion of conflicting obligations,
defeasibility, violability and contrary-to-duty conditionals. In the
framework of Adaptive Logics, various conflict-tolerant deontic logics
have been developed to handle (possibly prioritized) conflicting
(prima facie and/or conditional) obligations, cf. Van De Putte,
Beirlaen, &amp; Meheus forthcoming. Klein &amp; Marra 2020 introduces
a multi-modal logic in which the relation between prima facie
obligations and goals of an agent are modeled and linked to the
so-called enkratic principle. Finally, Goble 2013 provides a state of
the art overview of formal approaches to prima facie obligations and
deontic conflicts. In ethical theory, as with SDL, the dominant
assumption was that obligations could not conflict (or that those that
could were second class citizens to &ldquo;serious&rdquo;
obligations), but this began to change in the latter part of the
twentieth century. See for example, Gowans 1987.</p>

 By RE and some PC manipulations, \(\OB\)-K is equivalent to </p>

\[\neg \neg \OB \neg(p \amp \neg q) \rightarrow(\neg \OB \neg \neg q \rightarrow \neg \OB \neg \neg p),\]

\[\neg \PE (p \amp \neg q) \rightarrow(\PE \neg q \rightarrow \PE \neg p).\]

By PC, NC is equivalent to </p> 

\[\neg \neg \OB \neg \neg p \rightarrow \neg \OB \neg p,\]

<p>
and this is equivalent by definition to \(\neg \PE \neg p \rightarrow
\PE p\). Lastly, by PC, \(\OB\)-NEC is equivalent to if \(\vdash \neg
p\) then \(\vdash \neg \neg \OB \neg p\), and this is equivalent by

 Some early discussions and attempted solutions to this collapse can
be found in Chellas 1980 and Schotch &amp; Jennings 1981, both of whom
use non-normal modal logics for deontic logic. Brown 1996b uses a
similar approach to Chellas&rsquo; for modeling conflicting
obligations, but with the addition of an ordering relation on
obligations to model the relative stringency of obligations, thus
moving in the direction of a model addressing Plato&rsquo;s Dilemma as
well.</p>

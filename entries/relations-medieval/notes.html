<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Medieval Theories of Relations</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a> For the record, the other
categories are action, passion, time, place, position, and habit.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a> Intuitively, a monadic
(or one-place) property is one whose instances can belong to only one
subject at a time, whereas a polyadic (or many-place) property is one
whose instances can belong to more than one subject at a
time. Questions can be raised about the adequacy of this intuitive
characterization in connection with so-called reflexive relations such
as identity. For now we can ignore these complications; but see the
discussion in section 5.2, especially n. 39.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a> In medieval philosophy,
&lsquo;similar to&rsquo; (or <em>similis</em> followed by the dative
case) just means <em>same in quality as</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a> In <em>Categories</em> 7,
Aristotle makes it clear that he thinks the relating properties must
be accidents, for according to him no substance is a relation. See
<em>Categories</em> 7, 8a14f.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a> <em>Metaphysics</em> V,
15, 1021a30. All translations of Aristotle are taken, with slight
modification, from <em>The Complete Works of Aristotle</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a> Augustine discusses both
types of theological consideration in <em>De Trinitate</em> V,
especially 208&ndash;215. This text exercises enormous influence on the
subsequent medieval treatment of relational situations.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a> Boethius sets the
precedent here. In his commentary on the <em>Categories</em>, which
introduced medieval philosophers to all three terms, he not only moves
freely among them but explicitly denies that there is any difference
in meaning between two of them, namely, &lsquo;toward something&rsquo;
and &lsquo;relative&rsquo;: &ldquo;Whether we say <em>toward
something</em> or <em>relatives</em> makes no difference.&rdquo;
Boethius, <em>In Categorias Aristotelis</em>, 217.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a> For a helpful discussion
of some of the terms used by medieval philosophers to signify
relations, see Schmidt 1986, esp. 133&ndash;40.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a> Medievals typically rely on
context to distinguish use and mention,
and hence employ the same terms to refer both to relations and to the
predicates by means of which they are introduced.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a> Cf.  <em>Tractatus de
quantitate</em> q. 3 (in <em>Opera Theologica</em> x, 104). There is
some debate about how exactly Ockham&rsquo;s &lsquo;razor-type&rsquo;
claims are to be interpreted. For relevant discussion, see Boler 1985
and the notes cited in his article; cf. also Spade 1999, 100&ndash;117.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a> Albert claims to find
this objection in the writings of certain Muslim philosophers:
&ldquo;Some fairly recent philosophers such as Avicenna and Alfarabi
&hellip; say that no form that is a being (<em>ens</em>) belongs to a
thing unless it is absolute as far the being (<em>esse</em>) it has in
itself is concerned&mdash;as is clear from looking at cases of what is
hot, cold, white, black, and <em>all other things</em>.&rdquo;
<em>Liber de praedicamentis</em>, 222b. For further discussion, see
Brower 2001.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a> <em>Scriptum super
Primum Sententiarum</em>, fols. 318<sup>v</sup>a-b. For useful
discussion of Auriol&rsquo;s views, see Henninger 1989, 150&ndash;173.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a> In the early modern
period, philosophers habitually speak of relations as the
&ldquo;products of comparison&rdquo; or &ldquo;results of
thought&rdquo;, while at the same time allowing for things to be
related apart from the activity of any mind. See, e.g., Locke, <em>An
Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em>, bk. 2, chap. 2; Hume, <em>A
Treatise of Human Nature</em>, bk. 1, pt. 1, sec. 5; and Leibniz,
<em>Philosophische Schriften</em>, vol. 2, 486. Cf. also Henninger
1989, 184&ndash;186; Olson 1987, pp.37&ndash;43; and Cover and
O&rsquo;Leary-Hawthorne 1999, 58&ndash;86.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a> In his commentary on
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em>, Avicenna suggests that most of
his contemporaries endorse a form of anti-realism. For a translation
and discussion of the relevant texts, see Marmura 1975. On the
Mutakallim&#363;n, cf. Weinberg 1965, 89&ndash;91.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a> Part of Auriol&rsquo;s
innovation consists in the way he tries to accommodate this
intuition. See Henninger, 1989, 166&ndash;68.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a> This summary provides
what I take to be the point of Albert&rsquo;s difficult discussion in
<em>Liber de praedicamentis</em>, 224a-224b. For a detailed defense of
this interpretation, and its contemporary relevance, see Brower
2001.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a> For discussion of
Harclay&rsquo;s two views, and their relationship to Scotus&rsquo;s
and Ockham&rsquo;s, see Henninger 1989, 98&ndash;118.,</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a> For a good example of
this approach, see Abelard&rsquo;s discussion of universals in his
<em>Logica &lsquo;ingredientibus&rsquo;</em>, 7&ndash;32. For an English
translation of this discussion, see Spade 1994, 26&ndash;56.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a> During the thirteenth
and fourteenth centuries, this intuitive view of relational change was
often discussed in a connection with an authoritative passage from the
<em>Physics</em>: &ldquo;There is no motion in respect of relation:
for it may happen that when one correlative changes, the other can
truly be said not to change at all, so that in these cases the motion
is accidental&rdquo; (V, 2, 225b11&ndash;13).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a> It is worth noting in
passing, however, two other sorts of considerations. First, reductive
realists often appealed to various forms of an infinite regress
argument to support their position. This sort of argument is now
typically associated with the absolute idealist, F. H. Bradley, but it
was known to philosophers during the Middle Ages and taken by many
(including, Ockham and the later Harclay) to show that relations
cannot be really distinct from their foundations. Cf. Henninger 1989,
110&ndash;112, 121&ndash;122 and Adams 1987, vol. 1, 215&ndash;250. Second, reductive
realists also relied on various forms of what is sometimes called
&lsquo;the separation argument&rsquo;. After certain events in the
late thirteenth century, including the condemnations of 1277, it was
generally agreed that a real distinction between two or more items
implies that either can exist in separation from the other&mdash;at
least by God&rsquo;s power. As the reductive realists were quick to
point out, however, this tells against non-reductive realism. For if
relations are really distinct from their foundations, then it follows
that God can create the foundations without the corresponding
relations&mdash;and hence absurdly that, say, two white things could
exist without being similar, or two quantified things without being
either equal or unequal. Cf.  Harclay, &ldquo;Utrum Dei ad creaturam
sit relatio realis&rdquo; (herafter abbreviated &ldquo;Utrum
Dei&rdquo;), n. 18f. For further references and discussion, cf. also
Menn 1997. For a variation of the separation argument, sometimes used
against reductive realism, see Klima&rsquo;s discussion of
Psueudo-Campsall vs. Ockham in Spade 1999, esp. 123&ndash;127.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a> Ockham, however, leans
toward this sort of view in several of his <em>Quodlibetal</em>
questions, where he entertains the idea that abstract relative terms,
such as &lsquo;similitude&rsquo;, function as collective names, and
hence like other such terms (&lsquo;people&rsquo;, &lsquo;army&rsquo;,
&lsquo;crowd&rsquo;, &lsquo;company&rsquo;) refer to several things
taken jointly (<em>conjunctim</em>). Cf. <em>Quodl.</em> VI, q. 8 (in
<em>Opera Theolgica</em> ix, 616&ndash;617) and q. 25 (681&ndash;682).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a> All translations of Harclay are adopted, with
slight modification, from MacDonald forthcoming.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a> Harclay&rsquo;s
discussion is complicated and my interpretation is by no means
uncontroversial. For an alternative interpretation of this discussion,
see Henninger 1989, 112&ndash;117.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a> Again, the idea here is
that, by itself, Simmias&rsquo;s height is merely <em>potentially</em>
relative-making, and it only becomes <em>actually</em> relative-making
in the presence of another height, including Socrates&rsquo;s.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a> For a formal
reconstruction of this sort of view, see Klima 1991.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a> Harclay uses the term
&lsquo;toward-ness&rsquo; (<em>aditas</em>) in his question on
relations (see &ldquo;Utrum Dei,&rdquo; n. 50), whereas Aquinas often
uses &lsquo;disposition&rsquo; (<em>habitudo</em>) or &lsquo;relative
disposition&rsquo; (<em>relativa habitudo</em>), and eventually comes
to prefer &lsquo;order&rsquo; (<em>ordinatio</em>). Cf. n. 7
above.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a> Especially worth
mentioning in this context is Addis 1989 and Fumerton 2002. Addis (see
esp. 27&ndash;46) identifies several other contemporary or near-contemporary
philosophers who hold this sort of view (including Meinong, Husserl,
Bergmann, and Searle), but anyone holding a form of the so-called
adverbial theory of consciousness would also appear to be a
candidate. See also Brower and Brower-Toland 2008.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a> Harclay explicitly
addresses this sort of non-reductivist line in &ldquo;Utrum
Dei,&rdquo; n. 10f.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a> For this interpretation
of Aquinas, see Henninger 1989, 13&ndash;28.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a> Thus, according to
Henninger, the proper description of Aquinas&rsquo;s view about
relations and their foundations will vary depending on which criteria
one uses for identity and real distinction. See Henninger 1989,
29&ndash;31.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-31">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a> <em>De Trinitate</em>,
226. (&ldquo;&hellip;quamvis temporaliter incipiat dici, non tamen
ipsi substantiae dei accidisse intelligatur sed illi creaturae ad quam
dicitur&rdquo;)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-32">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-32">32.</a> <em>De Trinitate</em>,
226. Augustine introduces the example of the coin in the course of
defending his views about of creation. Thus, he says, if a coin can
change its relations solely in virtue of changes in the properties of
something else, &ldquo;how much easier ought we to accept this of the
unchangeable substance of God?&rdquo; (ibid).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-33">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-33">33.</a> For Boethius&rsquo;s
own statement of the example, see <em>De Trinitate</em> 5. Although
Boethius&rsquo;s example involves two human beings, the variation
involving an immobile column comes quickly to replace it, and over
time even to be attributed to Boethius himself. Thus, as Harclay
says at one point: &ldquo;Boethius offers the example of a
column&rsquo;s being to the right at the end of <em>De
Trinitate</em>.&rdquo; See &ldquo;Utrum Dei,&rdquo; n. 72.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-34">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-34">34.</a> Peter Lombard
(c. 1095&ndash;1160) discusses the relationship between God and creatures in
the first book of his <em>Sentences</em>, an influential summary of
Christian doctrine. From the mid-thirteenth through the mid-fourteenth
century, every student who earned a baccalaureate in theology was
required to lecture and comment on Peter&rsquo;s text. As a result,
commentaries on the first book of this text (around distinction 30)
become the <em>locus classicus</em> for medieval discussions of
relations. Cf. Henninger 1989, 8.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-35">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-35">35.</a> This way of thinking
about relations derives from a late 12<sup>th</sup>-century work of
unknown authorship (but traditionally ascribed to Gilbert of Poitiers)
called <em>Liber sex principiorum</em>. This work distinguishes the
first four Aristotelian categories (substance, quantity, quality, and
relation) as intrinsic and the last six categories as extrinsic. For a
representative treatment of the categories which follows this
division, see Aquinas&rsquo;s discussion in <em>In V Met</em>.,
lect. 9, n. 892 and the commentary in Wippel 1987 and 2000. Even
Aquinas, however, sometimes allows for extrinsic denomination in the
case of relations. Cf. <em>In Sent.</em> I, d. 40, q. 1, a. 1.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-36">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-36">36.</a> <em>Ordinatio</em> I,
d. 30, q. 5 (in <em>Opera Theologica</em> iv, 385&ndash;86). For a
discussion of Ockham&rsquo;s distinction between real relations and
relations of reason, see Henninger 1989, 136&ndash;40.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-37">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-37">37.</a> In one of his early
works, <em>Super Dionysium De divines nominibus</em>, Albert the Great
identifies all relations acquired as a result of mere Cambridge
changes as relations of reason&mdash;apparently overlooking the
possibility of acquiring <em>real</em> relations in the same way (as
in the case of Socrates&rsquo;s becoming shorter than Simmias as
result of Simmias&rsquo;s growth). For the relevant texts of Albert,
and helpful discussion, see MacDonald 1991, 31&ndash;55 (esp. 42&ndash;47). No
other medieval philosopher I know of makes this sort of
identification, and Albert himself comes to reject it in some of his
later works. Thus, as I indicated in section 4b above, in his
<em>Metaphysica</em> Albert explicitly allows for cases in which a
substance can acquire real relations without undergoing any real
change, and uses the distinction between relations and relational
accidents to explain how this is possible.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-38">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-38">38.</a> In <em>Monologion</em>
c. 25, Anselm distinguishes those accidents which require a change in
their subject from those that do not, and suggests that even God may
have accidents of the latter sort (though as he goes on to explain,
&lsquo;accidents&rsquo; of this latter sort are accidents only
according to an improper way of speaking). In &ldquo;Utrum Dei,&rdquo;
Harclay develops this distinction between two types of accident at
greater length, and attempts to connect it not only with Anselm but
also with Augustine and Boethius (cf. esp. nn.  110&ndash;120).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-39">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-39">39.</a> Interestingly, this same
line of reasoning leads some philosophers to deny that self-identity
is a relation at all. Consider, for example, the following passage
from Harclay&rsquo;s &ldquo;Utrum Dei,&rdquo; n.  32: &ldquo;real
identity is not a real relation, because it lacks one condition that
is necessary for being a relation (and which it is impossible for
something that is identical and that to which it is identical to
satisfy), namely, real distinctness of <em>relata</em>.  This
condition is satisfied in the case of distinct things but not in the
case of something that is one and the same [as itself]. For that
reason, distinctness is a relation but identity is not.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-40">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-40">40.</a> What Aquinas here
refers to as &lsquo;cause&rsquo; he elsewhere refers to as the
&lsquo;foundation in reality (<em>fundamentum in re</em>)&rsquo; of a
being of reason (cf., e.g., <em>In Sent.</em> I, d. 19, q. 5,
a. 1). In the case at hand, therefore, the relevant causes are just
the extramental foundations of the relations.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-41">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-41">41.</a> Medieval philosophers
often apply this consequence to cases involving privations (such as
blindness), since they involve negation, which is typically regarded
as a being of reason. Thus, it is commonly said that Homer would be
blind (that is, lack sight), even if Homer&rsquo;s blindness did not
exist. And the reason is that the truth of the latter claim depends
for its existence on the activity of the mind, whereas the former does
not. For further discussion and references, see Klima 1993.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-42">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-42">42.</a> Ockham does, however,
want to maintain (with Aristotle) that relation is a real category or
<em>genus generalissimum</em>. He does this by identifying a loose
sense in which relations can be said to exist outside the mind, and
indeed interprets Aristotle&rsquo;s own way of speaking along these
lines: &ldquo;according to the Philosopher&rsquo;s view,
&lsquo;relation&rsquo; is a category of the real not in the sense that
it signifies things outside [the mind] &hellip; but rather in the
sense that its species [i.e., specific relational concepts] signify
such things [outside the mind].&rdquo; See <em>Quodl.</em> VI, q. 22
(in <em>Opera Theologica</em> ix, 669); cf. Freddoso and Kelly 1991,
564 and Henninger 1989, 133.</p>

<div id="note-43">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-43">43.</a> <em>Summa
Theologiae</em> I, q. 28, a. 1, sed contra. Although this passage
occurs in the <em>sed contra</em>, it is clear from other works that
it represents Aquinas&rsquo;s own views. Cf. <em>De potentia</em>,
q. 8, a. 1.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-44">

<a href="index-2.html#ref-44">44.</a> <em>The Commentaries on
Boethius by Gilbert of Poitiers</em>, 79.  Gilbert&rsquo;s division of
the intellectual disciplines follows Boethius&rsquo;s discussion in
<em>De Trinitate</em> 2.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-45">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-45">45.</a> Cf. <em>The
Commentaries on Boethius by Gilbert of Poitiers</em>, 193, 223, and
227. For an excellent discussion of the relevant texts, to which my
own discussion is indebted, see MacDonald 1999.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-46">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-46">46.</a> One of Ockham&rsquo;s
most influential followers, John Buridan (d. 1358/61) even goes so far
as to say that everything is a relation (<em>relativum</em>, though
not <em>relatio</em>, since like Ockham he construes the latter as a second
intention). For everything can be conceived of in terms of a relative
concept, since everything is identical with itself and distinct from
everything else. Cf. <em>Summulae de Dialectica</em> 3.4.1.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-47">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-47">47.</a> I say
&lsquo;harmless&rsquo; because, like other medieval realists, Ockham
and his followers think many judgments of the form
&lsquo;<em>aRb</em>&rsquo; are true independently of the mind.
Nonetheless, because they deny that the term &lsquo;relation&rsquo;
refers to anything in extramental reality, and hence that strictly
speaking relations are concepts or beings of reason, there is a sense
in which their view qualifies as anti-realist.</p>

account of these broader historical developments, see Ashworth 1974;
cf. also Klima 2000, and the exchange between Zupko and Klima (in
Klima 1998).</p>

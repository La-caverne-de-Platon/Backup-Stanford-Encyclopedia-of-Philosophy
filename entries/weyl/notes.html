<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Hermann Weyl</a></h2>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>
 Husserl was a professor at G&ouml;ttingen during Weyl&rsquo;s student days 
there, and Weyl attended his lectures. But it was his wife Helene, 
who later came to G&ouml;ttingen to study with Husserl, who seems to 
have sparked Weyl&rsquo;s interest in phenomenology.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>
 In particular, while there is compelling evidence that the continued 
existence of the Ego (one&rsquo;s consciousness) is dependent on facts 
about the external world, for instance, the continuing biochemical 
activity of one&rsquo;s brain, that dependency cannot be taken as a 
<em>primary</em> datum for the Ego.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>
 As Weyl observed in 1925,</p>

<blockquote>
If phenomenal insight is referred to as <em>knowledge</em>, then the
theoretical one is based on <em>belief</em>&mdash;the belief in the
reality of the own I and that of others, or belief in reality of the
external world, or belief in the reality of God. If the organ of the
former is &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; in the widest sense, so the organ of
theory is &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; (Weyl 1925, 140).</blockquote>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>
 In a late paper Weyl offers the natural numbers &ldquo;by which we 
count objects&rdquo; as &ldquo;the simplest, and in a certain sense 
most profound, example of symbolic construction.&rdquo; He continues:</p>

<blockquote>
The most natural symbols for them are strokes, one put after the
other, |, ||, |||, &hellip; . The objects may disperse, &ldquo;melt,
thaw and resolve themselves into dew,&rdquo; but we thus can keep the
record of their number. What is more, we can by a constructive process
decide for two numbers represented through symbols which one is the
larger, namely by checking one symbol against the other, stroke by
stroke. This process reveals differences not manifest in direct
observation, which in most cases is incapable of distinguishing even
between such low numbers as 21 and 22. We are so familiar with these
miracles which the number symbols perform that we no longer wonder at
them. But this is only the prelude to the mathematical step proper. We
do not leave it to chance which numbers we actually meet by counting
this or that concrete set of objects, but we generate the open
sequence of <em>all possible</em> numbers which starts with 1 (or 0 =
nothing) and proceeds by adding to any number symbol \(n\) one
more stroke, whereby it changes into the following number \(n + 1\).
<em>Being</em> is thus projected onto the background of the
<em>possible</em>, more precisely onto a manifold of possibilities which
unfolds by iterating the same step again and again and remains open
into infinity. (Weyl 1985, 12&ndash;13.)</blockquote>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>
 It is perhaps for this reason that, unlike Einstein, for example, 
Weyl does not seem to have been especially troubled by the highly 
counterintuitive nature of quantum theory. Indeed, the conviction of 
numerous physicists that the quantum microworld is accessible to us 
only through abstract mathematical description serves as an excellent
illustration of Weyl&rsquo;s thesis that objective reality cannot be 
grasped directly, but only through the use of symbols.</p>

<p>

For Weyl the link between mathematics and natural science established
through symbolic construction was certainly very strong, as is 
attested by his observations in his [1985] on G. H. Hardy&rsquo;s <em>A 
Mathematician&rsquo;s Apology</em> (Hardy 1967). Introducing it as a 
&ldquo;charming little book&rdquo;, he continues:</p>

<blockquote>
For us today the idea that the Gods from whom we wrestled the
secret of knowledge by symbolic construction will revenge our
<em>hubris</em> has taken on a quite concrete form. For who can close
his eyes against the menace of our own self-destruction by science?
The alarming fact is that the rapid progress of scientific knowledge
is not paralleled by a corresponding growth of man&rsquo;s moral
strength and responsibility, which have hardly changed since
historical times. I think it is futile to claim with Hardy for
mathematics an exceptional and relatively innocent position in this
regard. He maintains that mathematics is a useless science, and this
means, he says, that it can contribute directly neither to the
exploitation of our fellow-men nor to their extermination. However
the power of science rests on the combination of experiment, i.e.,
observation under freely chosen conditions and <em>symbolic
construction</em>, and the latter is its mathematical aspect. Thus if
science is found guilty, mathematics cannot evade the
verdict.</blockquote>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>
In <em>Insight and Reflection</em> (also in <em>Philosophy of
Mathematics and Natural Science</em>) Weyl uses a geometric analogy to
illustrate his metaphysical scheme. In this analogy, objects,
subjects, and the appearance of an object to a subject are correlated
respectively with <em>points on a plane, (barycentric) coordinate
systems in the plane,</em> and <em>coordinates of a point</em>
<em>with respect to a such a coordinate system.</em> Here a 
coordinate system \(S\) consists of the vertices of a fixed 
nondegenerate triangle \(T\); each point \(p\) in the plane
determined by \(T\) is assigned a triple of numbers summing to 
1&mdash;its <em>barycentric coordinates</em> relative to 
\(S\)&mdash;representing the magnitudes of masses of total 
weight 1 which, placed at the vertices of \(T\), have centre of 
gravity at \(p\). Thus objects, i.e. points, and subjects i.e., 
coordinate systems or triples of points belong to the same 
&ldquo;sphere of reality.&rdquo; On the other hand, the 
<em>appearances</em> of an object to a subject, i.e., triples of 
numbers, lie, Weyl asserts, in a different sphere, that of 
<em>numbers</em>. These <em>number-appearances,</em> as Weyl calls 
them, correspond to the experiences of a subject, or of pure 
consciousness.</p>

<p>

From the standpoint of na&iuml;ve realism the points (objects) simply
exist as such, but Weyl indicates the possibility of constructing 
geometry (which under the analogy corresponds to external reality) 
solely in terms of number-appearances, so representing the world in 
terms of the experiences of pure consciousness, that is, from the 
standpoint of idealism. Thus suppose that we are given a coordinate 
system \(S\). Regarded as a subject or 
&ldquo;consciousness&rdquo;, from its perspective a point or object 
now corresponds to what was originally an appearance of an object, 
that is, a triple of numbers summing to 1; and, analogously, any 
coordinate system \(S'\) (that is, another subject or 
&ldquo;consciousness&rdquo;) corresponds to three such triples 
determined by the vertices of a nondegenerate triangle. Each
point or object \(p\) may now be <em>identified</em> with its 
coordinates relative to \(S\). The coordinates of \(p\) 
relative to any other coordinate system \(S'\) can be 
determined by a straightforward algebraic transformation: these 
coordinates represent the <em>appearance</em> of the object 
corresponding to \(p\) to the subject represented by 
\(S'\). Now these coordinates will, in general, 
<em>differ</em> from those assigned to \(p\) by our given coordinate
system \(S\), and will in fact coincide for all \(p\) if and only if
\(S'\) is what is termed by Weyl the <em>absolute</em> coordinate
system consisting of the three triples \((1,0,0)\), \((0,1,0)\),
\((0,0,1)\), that is, the coordinate system which corresponds to \(S\)
itself. Thus, for this coordinate system, &ldquo;object&rdquo; and
&ldquo;appearance&rdquo; coincide, which leads Weyl to term it
the <em>Absolute I</em>.</p>

<p>

Weyl points out that this argument takes place entirely within the 
realm of numbers, that is, for the purposes of the analogy, the 
<em>immanent consciousness</em>. In order to do justice to the claim 
of objectivity that all &ldquo;I&rdquo;s are equivalent, he suggests 
that only such numerical relations are to be declared of interest as 
remain unchanged under passage from an &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; to an 
arbitrary coordinate system, that is, those which are invariant under
arbitrary linear coordinate transformations. According to Weyl, 
&ldquo;this analogy makes it understandable why the unique 
sense-giving I, when viewed objectively, i.e., from the standpoint of
invariance, can appear as just one subject among many of its 
kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

At this point Weyl adds an intriguing parenthetical observation:</p>

<blockquote>Incidentally, a number of Husserl&rsquo;s theses become
demonstrably false when translated into the context of the
analogy&mdash;something which, it appears to me, gives serious cause
for suspecting them.</blockquote>

<p>

Unfortunately, we are not told precisely which of Husserl&rsquo;s theses 
are the &ldquo;suspect&rdquo; ones.</p>

<p>

Weyl goes on to emphasize:</p>

<blockquote>

Beyond this, it is expected of me that I recognize the other
I&mdash;the <em>you</em>&mdash;not only by observing in my thought the
abstract norm of invariance or objectivity, but absolutely: you
are <em>for you</em>, once again, what <em>I</em> am
for <em>myself</em>: not just an existing but a conscious carrier of
the world of appearances.</blockquote>

<p>

This recognition of the <em>Thou</em>, according to Weyl, can be 
presented within his geometric analogy only if it is furnished with a
purely <em>axiomatic</em> formulation. In taking this step Weyl sees 
a third viewpoint emerging in addition to that of realism and 
idealism, namely, a <em>transcendentalism</em> which 
&ldquo;postulates a transcendental reality but is satisfied with 
modelling it in symbols.&rdquo;</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
 The others, in order, are: <em>understanding and expression; thinking
the possible</em>; and finally, in science, <em>the construction of 
symbols or measuring devices</em>.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>
 See also the section on Weyl and Hilbert below.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>
 It is also worth quoting one of Weyl&rsquo;s last, bittersweet observations
on mathematics, from his (1985):</p>

<blockquote>

Mathematics has been called the science of the infinite.
Indeed, the mathematician invents finite constructions by which
questions are decided that by their very nature refer to the infinite.
That is his glory. Kierkegaard once said religion deals with what
concerns man unconditionally. In contrast (but with equal exaggeration)
one may say that mathematics deals with the things which are of no
concern to man at all. Mathematics has the inhuman quality of
starlight, brilliant and sharp, but cold. But it seems an irony of
creation that man&rsquo;s mind knows how to handle things the better
the farther removed they are from the center of his existence. Thus we
are cleverest where knowledge matters least.</blockquote>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>
 Nevertheless, Weyl seems to have been initially attracted to set 
theory&mdash;at least in the axiomatic formulation Zermelo provided 
for it in 1908. As emphasized by Feferman [2000], Weyl [1910] 
anticipates Fraenkel&rsquo;s and Skolem&rsquo;s later identification of Zermelo&rsquo;s
&ldquo;definite property&rdquo; with &ldquo;property definable within
the language of set theory&rdquo;.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>
 In this respect Weyl&rsquo;s views were close to those of Poincar&eacute;, 
and also, to some extent, those of Russell.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>
 In this connection it is of interest to note that on 9 February 1918 
Weyl and George P&oacute;lya made a bet in Z&uuml;rich in the 
presence of twelve witnesses (all of whom were mathematicians) that 
&ldquo;within 20 years, P&oacute;lya, or a majority of leading 
mathematicians, will come to recognize the falsity of the least upper
bound property.&rdquo; When the bet was eventually called, 
everyone&mdash;with the single exception of G&ouml;del&mdash;agreed 
that P&oacute;lya had won.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>
 Weyl shared with many mathematicians the conviction that the concept 
of natural number is the <em>fons et origo</em> of mathematics. For 
example, in [1921] we read:</p>

<blockquote>

The starting point of mathematics is the sequence of natural numbers,
that is, the law&hellip; which from nothing generates the first
number, and from every generated number generates the next following
one; a process never returning to a number that has already
occurred. If we want to capture numbers for our intuition, we must
distinguish them symbolically by means of qualitative
signs&hellip;. One can say that, in a mathematical examination of
Reality, an attempt is made to represent the world&mdash;which is
given to consciousness in its more general form of a penetration
of <em>Being</em> and <em>Essence</em> (of the &ldquo;this&rdquo; and
&ldquo;so&rdquo;)&mdash;in the absoluteness of pure Being. That is why
there is a profound truth in the Pythagorean doctrine that any being
as such is based on number.</blockquote>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>
 It is worth pointing out that Brentano, in his <em>On What is 
Continuous</em> of 1914, had drawn the similar conclusion that the 
continuum concept is derived from primitive sensible intuition and 
indeed that &ldquo;all our sensible intuitions present us with that 
which is continuous.&rdquo; This led him to regard the constructions 
of the continuum of Dedekind, Cantor, and their successors as 
&ldquo;fictions&rdquo;.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>
 The connection between mathematics and physics was of course of 
paramount importance for Weyl. His seminal work on relativity theory,
<em>Space-Time-Matter,</em> was published in the same year (1918) as 
<em>Das Kontinuum</em>; the two works reveal subtle affinities.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>
 This fact would seem to indicate that in Weyl&rsquo;s theory the domain of 
definition of a function is not unambiguously determined by the 
function, so that the continuity of such a &ldquo;function&rdquo; may
vary with its domain of definition. (This would be a natural 
consequence of Weyl&rsquo;s definition of a function as a certain kind of 
relation.) A simple but striking example of this phenomenon is 
provided in classical analysis by the function \(f\) which takes
value 1 at each rational number, and at each irrational number. 
Considered as a function defined on the rational numbers, \(f\) 
is constant and so continuous; as a function defined on the real 
numbers, \(f\) fails to be continuous anywhere.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>
 E.g. in Weyl [1950], 8 and [1949], 123</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>
 However there were marked differences between Weyl&rsquo;s and Brouwer&rsquo;s 
philosophical attitudes. Brouwer&rsquo;s philosophy amounted virtually to 
solipsism, while Weyl still seems to have cleaved to phenomenology, 
at least up to 1928. And from what Weyl reveals about his later 
philosophical development, it is clear that it carried him even 
further away from Brouwer. (For an analysis of the relationship 
between intuitionism and phenomenology in Weyl&rsquo;s thought, see Mancosu
and Ryckman [2002].)</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a>
 Nevertheless, there is reason to think that Weyl continued to regard 
the predicative approach underlying <em>Das Kontinuum</em> as being 
of genuine value. If indeed this is the case, then Weyl&rsquo;s belief was 
correct, since <em>Das Kontinuum</em> is now viewed as the initial 
stage in the emergence of predicative mathematics, which has 
undergone a rapid development since the 1960s (see Feferman [1988], 
[2000]).</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>
 Weyl&rsquo;s contention is strikingly similar to (and may have had an 
influence on) Hilbert&rsquo;s later assertion that &ldquo;contentual&rdquo;
statements are, from the finitist standpoint, incapable of being 
negated. See, e.g., Hilbert [1926], 378.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>
 For my remarks on Weyl&rsquo;s relationship with Intuitionism I have drawn 
on the illuminating paper van Dalen [1995].</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>
 Here is Weyl enlarging on the issue in 1921:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;if we pick out a specific point, say, \(x = 0\), on the
number line \(C\) (i.e., on the variable range of a real
variable \(x)\), then one cannot, under any circumstance, claim
that every point either coincides with it or is disjoint from it. The
point \(x = 0\) thus does not at all split the
continuum \(C\) into two parts \(C^{-}: x \lt 0\) and C\(^{+}: x \gt 0\), in the sense that C would
consist of the union of C\(^{- }\), C\(^{+}\) and the one
point 0 &hellip;. If this appears offensive to present-day
mathematicians with their atomistic thought habits, it was in earlier
times a self-evident view held by everyone: Within a continuum, one
can very well generate subcontinua by introducing boundaries; yet it
is irrational to claim that the total continuum is made up of the
boundaries and the subcontinua. The point is, <em>a genuine
continuum</em> is something connected in itself, and <em>it cannot be
divided into separate fragments</em>; this conflicts with its
nature. (Weyl 1921, 111.)</blockquote>

<p>

 Brouwer established the continuity of functions fully defined on a 
continuum in 1904, but did not publish a definitive account until 
1927. In that account he also considers the possibility of partially 
defined functions.</p>

 Quoted in Reid [1986], 72. And over Hilbert&rsquo;s grave in G&ouml;ttingen
is inscribed: <em>Wir m&uuml;ssen wissen / Wir werden wissen</em> 
(&ldquo;We must know / We shall know.&rdquo;) (<em>Ibid.,</em> 220.)</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a>
 In 1922, Hilbert declared:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

What Weyl and Brouwer do comes to the same thing as following in the 
footsteps of Kronecker! They seek to save mathematics by throwing 
overboard all which is troublesome&hellip; They would chop up and 
mangle the science. If we would follow such a reform as the one they 
suggest, we would run the risk of losing a great part of our valuable
treasures! (Reid 1986, 155).</p>

<p>

I believe that, just as little as Kronecker was unable to get rid of 
the irrational numbers&hellip;just as little will Weyl and Brouwer be
able to succeed. Brouwer is not, as Weyl believes, the 
Revolution&mdash;only the repetition of an attempted Putsch, in its 
day, more sharply undertaken yet failing utterly, and now, with the 
State armed and strengthened, doomed from the start! (<em>Ibid</em>.,
157.)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a>
 It is this aspect of Hilbert&rsquo;s program which led, somewhat 
inappropriately, to its becoming termed &ldquo;formalism&rdquo;. It 
should be emphasized that Hilbert was <em>not</em> claiming that 
(classical) mathematics <em>itself</em> was meaningless, only that 
the formal system representing it was to be so regarded.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a>
 This is borne out by the following quotation from Hilbert [1927]:</p>

<blockquote>
No more than any other science can mathematics be founded on logic
alone; rather, as a condition for the use of logical inferences and
the performance of logical operations, something must already be given
to us in our faculty of representation, certain extralogical concrete
objects that are intuitively present as immediate experience prior to
all thought. If logical inference is to be reliable, it must be
possible to survey these objects completely in all their parts, and
the fact that they occur, that they differ from one another, and that
they follow each other, or are concatenated, is immediately given
intuitively, together with the objects, as something that can neither
be reduced to anything else, nor requires reduction. This is the
basic philosophical position that I regard as requisite for
mathematics and, in general, for all scientific thinking,
understanding, and communication. And in mathematics, in particular,
what we consider is the concrete signs themselves, whose shape,
according to the conception we have adopted, is immediately clear and
recognizable. This is the very least that must be presupposed, no
scientific thinker can dispense with it, and therefore everyone must
maintain it, consciously or not.</blockquote>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a>
 Underlying this guarantee, of course, is the further assumption that 
there are no &ldquo;contradictions in nature&rdquo;.</p>

 Weyl [1927], 483. Indeed, in his [1946], Weyl remarks that had it not
been for G&ouml;del&rsquo;s demonstration in 1931 that Hilbert&rsquo;s program 
could not be successfully carried out, &ldquo;it is likely that 
mathematicians would have accepted Hilbert&rsquo;s approach.&rdquo; </p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-30" name="30">30.</a>
 Weyl [1925], 140. Weyl [1949] contains a similar observation:</p>

<blockquote>

A truly realistic mathematics should be conceived, in line with
physics, as a branch of the construction of the one real world, and
should adopt the same sober and cautious attitude toward hypothetic
extensions of its foundations as is exhibited by
physics.(231).</blockquote>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-31" name="31">31.</a>
 Weyl [1927], 484. Mancosu and Ryckman (2002) show that Weyl had 
already begun to retreat from intuitionism because of what he saw as 
its incapability of supporting natural science, in particular the 
theoretical physics which was of paramount importance for him.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a>
 Weyl also observes (<em>ibid</em>., 61):</p>

<blockquote>

But whatever the ultimate value of Hilbert&rsquo;s program, his bold
enterprise can claim one merit: it has disclosed to us the highly
complicated and ticklish logical structure of mathematics, its maze of
back-connections, which result in circles of which it cannot be
gathered at a first glance whether they might not lead to blatant
contradictions.</blockquote>

 If one is interested in the entire extension of an 
\(n\)-dimensional Riemannian space, then a finite or infinite 
number of partially overlapping coordinate patches are needed to 
cover the \(n\)-dimensional Riemannian manifold in its entirety.
However, this is of little concern if the focus is on infinitesimal 
neighbourhoods of points.</p>

 The <em>Einstein summation convention </em>says: whenever a lower 
(upper) index is repeated as an upper (lower) index, it is understood
to imply summation over the index from 1 to \(n\), the dimension 
of the manifold or space. The index \(k\) in equations (1) and (2)
is said to be <em>free </em>and in the current context takes on any 
value from 1 to \(n\). The repeated indices \(i\) and \(j\) 
are <em>bound </em>or <em>dummy </em>indices because they can be 
replaced by any other index not already in use as a bound index. </p>

 The electric action in Faraday&rsquo;s interaction model is not 
regarded as somehow reaching across the finite spatial separation of 
two charged particles. Rather, one understands the interaction as an 
<em>infinitesimal </em>interaction between the charged body and its 
surrounding field. A charged body &ldquo;<em>feels</em>&rdquo; a 
force because it is in <em>contact </em>with its surrounding field; 
that is, each charged body &ldquo;feels&rdquo; the field of the other
as a <em>local </em>force. Just as Faraday&rsquo;s field 
interpretation of electric phenomena may be contrasted with 
action-at-a-distance interpretations, so Riemann&rsquo;s 
<em>infinitesimal geometric standpoint </em>may be contrasted with 
<em>distance-geometry</em>, such as, Euclidean and ordinary 
non-Euclidean geometry. </p>

<p>

Hermann von Helmholtz considered the <em>homogeneity postulate 
</em>required for the free mobility of rigid body motion to be a 
necessary pre-condition for the very possibility of geometrical 
knowledge. Abstracting from our experience of the movement of rigid 
bodies, Helmholtz was able to mathematically derive Riemann&rsquo;s 
distance formula (2). The difference between Euclidean and 
<em>ordinary </em>non-Euclidean geometry &ldquo;in the large&rdquo; 
consists only in the discarding of the axiom of parallelism. By 
requiring the <em>homogeneity postulate </em>underlying the free 
mobility of ideal rigid bodies, Helmholtz thereby limited his 
considerations to Euclidean and <em>ordinary </em>non-Euclidean 
geometries. </p>

<p>

Riemann thought that Helmholtz&rsquo;s homogeneity postulate for 
rigid body motion, and the Euclidean and ordinary non-Euclidean 
geometries entailed by it, may not hold strictly but only 
approximately. With remarkable foresight, Riemann considered the 
possibility that rigid body motion may break down, and approached the
problem of physical geometry from a much more general basis, which 
includes Euclidean and ordinary non-Euclidean geometry as a limiting 
case. Indeed from the standpoint of modern physics the existence of 
rigid bodies and rigid body motion is not a fundamental self-evident 
requirement anymore, but only a special property that obtains in a 
definite limiting case of the physics of classical mechanics and 
geometry. Helmholtz&rsquo;s reasoning only shows that the possibility
of this limiting case entails the Riemannian metric. Riemann adopted 
the same principles in geometry as did Faraday and Maxwell before him
in electromagnetism, namely, to understand the world from its 
behavior in the infinitely small. Riemann thereby introduced into the
study of geometry the notion of <em>geometric fields</em> and foresaw
the possibility of a dynamical geometry which not only acts on matter
but is in turn affected by matter. See Scholz (1992) on 
Riemann&rsquo;s vision of a new approach to Geometry. </p>

 Any vector space with a metric tensor has an orthonormal basis in 
which the metric has the canonical form </p>

\[
\diag(- 1, \ldots ,- 1, 1, \ldots , 1).
\]

<p>

The sum of these diagonal elements, that is, the trace of the
canonical form, is called the <em>signature </em>of the metric. If the
metric is <em>positive-definite</em>, then its canonical form is
\(\diag(1, 1, \ldots , 1)\). A metric that is not positive-definite,
is called <em>indefinite</em>. The metric of Einstein&rsquo;s theory
of special relativity is indefinite and has signature \(+2\) or \(-
2\) corresponding respectively to the traces of the canonical form
\(\diag(- 1, 1, 1, 1)\) or \(\diag(- 1,- 1,- 1, 1)\).
Positive-definite metrics are called <em>Riemannian</em>, whereas the
indefinite metric of relativity theory is called <em>Lorentzian</em>
or <em>Pseudo-Riemannian</em>. </p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-38" name="38">38.</a>
 The concept of infinitesimal parallel vector displacement is 
essential for doing calculus on manifolds. In an unstructured smooth 
continuum or manifold, in Weyl&rsquo;s words &ldquo;a completely 
formless four-dimensional continuum in the sense of analysis 
situs,&rdquo; there are very few calculus-based operations available.
Apart from the limited application of the <em>exterior 
derivative</em> of a differential form, such an amorphous manifold 
does not have enough structure with which to define a general notion 
of differentiation. To be able to differentiate vector or tensor 
fields in order to determine how such fields change as they move from
point to point over the manifold, requires some means by which to 
<em>compare</em> the geometric relations or objects
at <em>different</em> infinitesimally nearby points on the
manifold. That is, a general notion of the &ldquo;derivative&rdquo; is
required which is defined independently of any particular coordinate
choice that labels the points of the manifold in some local coordinate
neighbourhood. </p>

<p>

This problem is relatively simple in a Euclidean space because such a
space satisfies two conditions: it admits global Cartesian 
coordinates and a path-independent <em>distant </em>parallelism of 
vectors. Because of the latter condition a Euclidean space is an 
<em>affine </em>space; it is a vector space in which no point is
singled out as the origin. If in a Euclidean space a set of basis
vectors is attached to a point \(O\) as origin, then it is possible to
describe the space with respect to any other point \(O'\) as the
origin, by taking as a basis at \(O'\) those vectors which are
parallel to the basis vectors at \(O\). Consequently, in the
\(n\)-dimensional Euclidean space \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) the notion of a
derivative is readily available. Let \(v\) be a vector field in
\(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) defined along a curve \(x = x(t)\). The derivative
of this vector field is another vector field \(dv\,/\,dt\) along the
curve, defined, as usual by </p>

\[\tag{63}
v\,'(t) = \frac{dv(t)}{dt} = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{[v(t+h)-v(t)]}{h}.
\]

<p>

It is clear that one is comparing a vector at one point, 
\(x(t)\), with another vector at the second point, 
\(x(t + h)\). This comparison is possible because 
\(\mathbb{R}^{n}\), being an affine space, allows us to 
parallel translate a vector at a given point to any other point in 
\(\mathbb{R}^{n}\). But this definition of the derivative 
cannot be carried over directly to a vector or tensor field defined 
over a general manifold. In such a situation, tangent vectors, or 
more generally, tensors at two different points 
\(x^{i}\) and \(x^{i} + dx^{i}\), obey different transformation 
laws; consequently, their difference is not a tensor. Tensorial 
quantities, such as vectors and other entities, can be algebraically 
combined and manipulated only when they are located at the same point
on the manifold. If it is possible, however, to compare two tangent 
vectors which are located at two infinitesimally nearby points, 
<em>at one of the two points</em>, by means of an <em>appropriate</em>
notion of infinitesimal parallel displacement of one tangent vector to
the location of the other, then we can determine their difference; and
their difference will itself be a vector, and therefore a tensorial
quantity, provided the process of infinitesimal parallel transport
employed, is coordinate independent. See for example (Frankel, 1997,
236). </p>

Let \(M\) and \(N\) be manifolds. If \(f : M \rightarrow N\) is
\(C^{\infty}\), one-to-one, onto, and has \(C^{\infty}\) inverse, then
\(f\) is called a <em>diffeomorphism</em> and \(M\) and \(N\) are said
to be <em>diffeomorphic</em>. Diffeomorphic manifolds have identical 
manifold structures. In the current context, \(M\) and \(N\) 
are replaced by \(\mathbb{R}\). For further discussion of the notion of a

It is useful in this context to recall Einstein&rsquo;s (1954)
distinction between <em>principle </em>theories
and <em>constructive</em> theories. The aim of a constructive theory,
such as, for example, the kinetic theory of gases, is to reduce a wide
class of diverse complex physical processes to simpler ones. On the
other hand, a principle theories, such as, for example, the special
and the general theories of relativity, postulate abstract structural
constraints which events are held to satisfy. In order to exhibit the
physical basis for the structural constraints, which a principle
theory postulates certain events must satisfy, such structures
contained in the mathematical model of the theory should have a link
to physical experience. It must therefore be possible, at least in
principle, to relate those structural constraints to experience in a
way that is consistent with the theory. As Bohr and Rosenfeld (1933,
1950) suggest, any principle theory should satisfy the basic
requirement of a <em>proper</em> or <em>complete</em> theory.
According to Marzke and Wheeler (1964), Bohr and Rosenfeld &ldquo;have
stressed that every proper theory should provide in and by itself its
own means for defining the quantities with which it deals. According
to this principle, classical general relativity should admit to
calibrations of space and time that are altogether free of any
reference to the quantum of action.&rdquo; That is, completeness
requires that there is a link to physical experience of the various
structures inherent in the mathematical model of a principle theory of
spacetime, and that this link is realizable, by means of relatively
simple physical probative systems which are themselves well defined
within the classical spacetime theory, and which therefore can provide
within the classical framework, at least in principle, epistemic
access to the relevant structures postulated by the spacetime
theory. </p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-55" name="55">55.</a>
 In a <em>Finsler geometry </em>the general definition of the length 
of a vector is not necessarily given in the form of the square root 
of a quadratic form (symmetric bilinear form) as in the Riemannian 
case. That is, a Finsler geometry is a Riemannian geometry without 
this quadratic restriction. As we saw earlier, Riemann had already 
implicitly introduced a Finsler metric structure by introducing a 
metric structure in a general space based on the arc element </p>

\[\begin{align}
ds &amp;= F[x^{1}(p),\ldots,x^{n}(p); dx^{1}(p), \ldots, dx^{n}(p)] \\
   &amp;=_{def} F[x(p); dx(p)] \\
   &amp;=_{def} F_{p}(dx),
\end{align}\]

<p>

where \(ds = F[x(p);dx(p)] = F_{p}(dx)\), known as the 
<em>Finsler function</em> or <em>Finsler metric field</em>, is a 
smooth, non-negative function in the 2n variables, and is zero only 
when \(dx(p) = 0\). Moreover, Riemann also required 
\(ds = F[x(p); dx(p)] = F_{p}(dx)\) to be homogeneous of 
degree 1 in the \(dx(p)\)s, that is, </p>

\[\begin{align}
\lvert \lambda \rvert ds &amp;= \lvert \lambda \rvert F[x(p); dx(p)] \\
 &amp;= F[x(p); \lambda dx(p)] \\
 &amp;= F_p(\lambda dx), \lambda \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{align}\]

<p>

For the case of positive-definite Finsler metrics, it is customary to
work with the function \(F_{p}\) that determines 
the infinitesimal length interval \(ds\); however, for some 
purposes, it is more natural to work with the Finsler function 
\(F^{2}_{p}\) that determines 
\(ds^{2}\), particularly in the case of indefinite 
metrics. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-56" name="56">56.</a>
 It should be noted that this characterization of Weyl&rsquo;s problem
of space is based on Coleman and Kort&eacute; (2001), which differs 
radically from the commonly held view that can be found in, for 
example, Scheibe (1957, 1988), Laugwitz (1958) and Scholz (1999b, 
2001). Coleman and Kort&eacute; (2001) have argued that the commonly 
held view of Weyl&rsquo;s problem of space had its origin in the work
of Cartan, who got his understanding of what Weyl was doing from the 
French translation of the fourth edition of Weyl&rsquo;s book 
<em>Raum-Zeit-Materie</em>. A detailed account of the commonly held 
view, together with an argument in favour of the view that 
Weyl&rsquo;s problem of space was really concerned only with Finsler 
metrics, and that Cartan invented a different problem of space, which
was concerned with \(G\)-structures instead, is given in &sect;4.6, and 
&sect;4.7 of Coleman and Kort&eacute; (2001). </p>

<p>

It is interesting to note in this context that according to a recent 
article by Chern (1996), virtually all of the important theorems 
pertaining to Riemannian geometry have been extended to the setting 
of general Finsler metrics, and that Riemannian geometry, therefore, 
should be regarded merely as a special case of Finsler geometry. </p>

 Using the jet and jet-bundle formalism of Ehresmann (1951a,b,c, 
1952a,b, 1983), they first formulate quite general path structures 
which are not defined at the outset in terms of <em>geodesic</em>
paths and which require for their description only the local 
differential topological structure. They then prove a number of 
theorems, which generalizes a result proved by Ehlers and K&ouml;hler
(1977). The theorems serve as necessary and sufficient criteria for 
singling out free (fall) motion and involve only local differential 
topological concepts and are coordinate and frame independent. They 
also show that the theorems are epistemically effective in that they 
can be employed as <em>empirical</em> criteria for singling out free 
(fall) motion at a level of testing that requires no more structure 
than is needed for introducing arbitrary physical local coordinates 
(local differential topology). Coleman and Kort&eacute; argue that 
their results establish that the projective axioms concerning free 
(fall) motion in Ehlers, Pirani and Schild&rsquo;s constructive 
axiomatics is <em>epistemically decidable</em> in a non-circular, 
non-conventional way. </p>

 Einstein&rsquo;s field equations for the metric tensor in matter-free
regions are not linear. That is, the linear combination of two 
solutions to the field equations is not necessarily a solution. The 
gravitational field of a body can do work and therefore contains 
energy, and since it contains energy it must possess mass, which in 
turn creates an additional gravitational field. Consequently, the 
gravitational field <em>itself</em> contributes to its own source. 
This means that the gravitational field produced by two bodies is not
simply the sum of the separate fields but also involves contributions
from their interaction. Thus in providing solutions to <em>linearized</em>
field equations the gravitational effects are simply considered 
as additive, thereby ignoring the effects which the gravitational 
field has on its own source. </p>

 Sklar (1974, 229&ndash;233) has suggested that the problem of 
absolute acceleration arises because we tend to think of acceleration
as a <em>dyadic</em> relation: something accelerates either with 
respect to some observable or unobservable entity. Sklar suggests 
that there is an alternative way to think of absolute acceleration, 
which, if adopted by the relationalist, will avoid the traditional 
relationalist difficulties concerning absolute acceleration. He 
proposes that we think of acceleration as a <em>monadic</em> relation
so that &ldquo;the expression &lsquo;\(A\) is absolutely 
accelerated&rsquo; is a complete assertion, as is, for example, 
&lsquo;\(A\) is red&rsquo;&hellip;.&rdquo; It should be clear from
the foregoing, however, that Sklar&rsquo;s suggestion is incoherent 
within the context of GTR. The inhomogeneity of the transformation 
law of the 3-acceleration entails that an acceleration that is zero 
with respect to one coordinate system is not zero with respect to 
another coordinate system. Consequently, absolute nonacceleration 
conceived of as a monadic property is not a well defined concept 
because it is not a coordinate independent notion. A monadic property
which can be transformed away by means of a passive coordinate 
transformation can hardly represent a brute, inexplicable fact about 
the world. However, the difference 
\(\xi^{\alpha}_{2} - \Pi^{\alpha}_{2}(x^{i}, \xi^{\alpha}_{1})\)
transforms linearly and homogeneously; consequently, the vanishing or
non-vanishing of these <em>field-body relations</em> is coordinate 
independent. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-72" name="72">72.</a>
 Thus formulated, the law of inertia is an empirical law. It is 
falsifiable, for if there exist at least two sets of particles each 
of which is governed by a distinct <em>geodesic </em>directing field 
\(\Pi_{2}\) and \(\Pi'_{2}\), then particles belonging to the two 
distinct directing-field sets may be identified and in turn may be 
used to measure in any chosen local neighbourhood of spacetime the 
two distinct projective structures. This discovery procedure is a 
non-circular, coordinate and frame independent epistemically 
effective procedure which makes use of a purely local differential 
topological criterion for geodesicity. (See Coleman and Kort&eacute; 
(1980, 1982, 1984, 1987, 1989, 1990)) </p>

 Like the Einstein universe, de Sitter&rsquo;s universe was 
<em>assumed </em>to be static. However, unlike Einstein&rsquo;s 
universe, it contained no matter. It is tempting to reject de 
Sitter&rsquo;s solution on the grounds that de Sitter&rsquo;s 
universe is empty. Consequently, the initial interest in de 
Sitter&rsquo;s solution focused primarily on Einstein&rsquo;s 
mistaken claim that his field equations do not permit vacuum 
solutions. However, de Sitter&rsquo;s universe has some other 
interesting properties which subsequently came to be appreciated 
because of new astronomical discoveries in the early 1920&rsquo;s 
that suggested that the universe is not static, but expanding. This 
engendered an interest to find a cosmological model of such a 
universe. Because de Sitter&rsquo;s relativistic model provided the 
only alternative to Einstein&rsquo;s model, it aroused new interest 
and was reexamined in light of these astronomical discoveries. It was
realized that mathematically placing hypothetical particles into de 
Sitter&rsquo;s empty spacetime&mdash;particles that have no mass 
and do not influence the spacetime geometry&mdash;they accelerate 
away from each other. This means that while de Sitter&rsquo;s 
universe is empty from a dynamic point of view, kinematically it is 
non-static, it is expanding. Moreover, although de Sitter&rsquo;s 
specific coordinate representation of the metric of his solution 
might lead one to think that his universe is static, there exists 
another set of coordinates with respect to which the metric of de 
Sitter&rsquo;s universe assumes an explicitly dynamical form. 
According to Eddington (1933, 46): &ldquo;The situation has been 
summed up in the statement that Einstein&rsquo;s universe contains 
matter but no motion and de Sitter&rsquo;s contains motion but no 
matter.&rdquo; </p>

Study&rsquo;s rebuke since Study was in the habit of attacking just 
about everybody. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that his attention 
was drawn to the theory of invariants of groups, the full analysis of
which requires the theory of group representations. </p>

 As was mentioned in (&sect;4.2), Cartan obtained his understanding of
Weyl&rsquo;s Raumproblem from the French translation of the fourth 
edition of Weyl&rsquo;s (1923b) book. Thus Cartan did not have before
him Weyl&rsquo;s simplified and improved proof which Weyl (1923a, 
Appendix 12) published in the spring of 1923. Soon after, Cartan 
(1922, 1923b) wrote two papers on the subject. It is clear from these
papers that Cartan adopted a \(G\)-structure (metric) view of 
Weyl&rsquo;s analysis; that is, Cartan analyzed Weyl&rsquo;s space 
problem on the basis moving frames and differential forms. Cartan 
formulated the crucial theorem in this context for any 
volume-preserving subgroup of \(GL(n)\). Weyl (1923a, Appendix 12, 88) 
said, referring to (Cartan (1922)): </p>

<blockquote>

A quite different proof has been given by E. Cartan &hellip;; it rests
on the earlier, general and deep investigations by Cartan on the
theory of continuous groups in which he succeeded in solving quite
generally the problem of the presentation of all abstract groups
&hellip; and of their realization by means of infinitesimal, linear
operations. &hellip; <em>He needs only to select from the
groups presented by him those which satisfy my requirements.</em>

</blockquote>

<p>

Weyl then points out that his own proof is more direct and elementary
than Cartan&rsquo;s proof, which, according to Weyl, required an 
extensive detour involving the theory of semisimple Lie algebras. </p>

<blockquote> <p>

In contrast to Cartan&rsquo;s proof mine does not take the detour of 
the investigation of abstract groups. It is based on the classical 
theory of the individual linear mapping which goes back to 
Weierstrass.</p>

 Ryckman (2003, 61) correctly points out, &ldquo;Weyl did not start

&lsquo;infinitesimal&rsquo; geometry. The resulting 
&lsquo;unification&rsquo; was, as it were, serendipitous.&rdquo; </p>

 As Kragh (1990, 64) describes it: </p>

<blockquote> <p>

Dirac&rsquo;s theory of the electron had a revolutionary effect on 
quantum physics. It was as though the relativistic equation had a 
life of its own, full of surprises and subtleties undreamed of by 
Dirac when he worked it out. During the next couple of years, these 
aspects were uncovered. The mathematics of the equation was explored 
by von Neumann, Van der Waerden, Fock, Weyl, and others, and the most
important result of this work was the spinor analysis, which built 
upon a generalization of the properties of the Dirac matrices. Dirac 
had not worried about the mathematical nature of his four-component 
quantities; at first, it took the mathematical physicists by surprise
to learn that the quantities were neither four-vectors nor tensors.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-99" name="99">99.</a>
 One may think of spinors as two-component vectors that change sign 
under a \(2\pi\) rotation. Thus to get back to the initial state 
requires a \(4\pi\) rotation. Misner et al. (1973, 1148&ndash;49) 
provide a vivid illustration of a spinorial transformation. See also 
Penrose (2004). </p>

 Noether (1918) published a paper that is now famously associated with
&lsquo;Noether&rsquo;s theorem&rsquo;. Brading (2002) has drawn 
attention to the fact that the so-called Noether theorem is one of 
two theorems proved in the 1918 paper and concerns <em>global</em> 
symmetries, whereas the lesser known second theorem pertains to 
<em>local </em>symmetries. Brading also shows that Weyl pioneered the
use of Noether&rsquo;s second theorem already in the third and later 
editions of <em>Raum-Zeit-Materie</em> and in Weyl (1918a), by 
connecting conservation of electric charge with local gauge symmetry.
Moreover, Brading points out that &ldquo;[i]n his 1929 paper 
&lsquo;Electron and Gravitation&rsquo; Weyl follows exactly the same 
general strategy as in his 1918 work, applying it to his new unified 
theory of matter and electromagnetism (as opposed to the 1918 unified
theory of gravity and electromagnetism)&rdquo;. See also Brading and

 Noting Weyl&rsquo;s strong association of gauge invariance with 
relativity theory in Weyl&rsquo;s 1929 paper, Yang (1986) remarks: 
&ldquo;Twenty years later, when Mills and I worked on non-Abelian 
gauge fields, our motivation was completely divorced from general 
relativity and we did not appreciate that gauge fields and general 
relativity are somehow related. Only in the late 1960&rsquo;s did I 
recognize the structural similarity mathematically of non-Abelian 
gauge fields with general relativity and understand that they both 
were <em>connections </em>mathematically.&rdquo; </p>

 The first part of the paper deals with the physical interpretation of
the representation of physical magnitudes by Hermitean forms on 
Hilbert space. The second part of the paper is a group-theoretical 
analysis of quantum kinematics and deals with the nature and 
interpretation of canonical variables. In the third and final part of
the paper, Weyl treats the dynamical problem from the viewpoint of a 
one parameter group of unitary transformations in system space 
generated by the Hamiltonian operator of the system. Weyl then notes 
that the formalism of quantum mechanics that he has just presented is
not compatible with the special theory of relativity and that a 
general solution of this problem is not at hand. </p>

 Weyl (1928, 1931b, 1949a) suggested that Pauli&rsquo;s Exclusion 
Principle vindicates the contingent truth of <em>Leibniz&rsquo;s 
Principle</em> <em>of the Identity of Indiscernibles </em>for 
fermions. Roughly speaking, since no two electrons, or more 
generally, no two fermions may occupy the same quantum state, they 
cannot have all the same monadic state-dependent properties. 
Therefore, although numerically distinct, they are not 
indescernibles. The reader my wish to consult a recent review article
on this topic by Muller and Saunders (2008) and its many references 
to the literature concerning the problem of identical particles. </p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-108" name="108">108.</a>
 How did the theory of relativity force us to recognize that in 
physics in general, and in general relativity in particular, space 
and time &ldquo;must be replaced by a four-dimensional continuum in 
the abstract arithmetical sense&rdquo;? To clarify this, it helps to 
distinguish between three types of coordinate systems: 
<em>formal</em>, <em>theoretic </em>and <em>physical </em>(See 
(Coleman and Kort&eacute; (1995)).). </p>

<p>

<em>Formal</em> coordinates are purely abstract, mathematical
coordinates that are used by the theorist to model the contents of the
world, the dynamics and interactions of the various physical entities
of the world and the physical procedures used to measure and survey
the world. Typically, it is stated that an \(n\)-dimensional,
differentiable manifold \(M\) is a Hausdorff, topological space
equipped with an atlas, that is, a family
\(\{(U_{\alpha},x_{\alpha})\}\) of charts, such that the open
neighbourhoods \(U_{\alpha}\) cover \(M\). The maps \(x_{\alpha} :
U_{\alpha} \rightarrow x_{\alpha\vdash}(U_{\alpha}) \subseteq
\mathbb{R}^{n}\) are homeomorphisms, and whenever \(U_{\alpha} \cap
U_{\beta}\ne\varnothing\), the coordinate
transformation maps </p>

\[
x_{\beta} \circ x^{- 1}_{\alpha}: x_{\alpha\vdash}(U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta}) 
 \rightarrow x_{\beta\vdash}(U_{\alpha} \cap U_{\beta})
\]

<p>

are \(C^{k}\) for \(1 \lt k \lt \infty,\) \(C^{\infty}\) or
\(C^{\omega}\). The coordinate charts \((U_{\alpha},x_{\alpha})\)
are formal. </p>

<p>

<em>Theoretical </em>coordinates, also called, <em>adapted</em>
coordinates, are determined by some fundamental entity, 
typically the geometric structure of the world that is postulated by 
the theory. For example, in Galilean models of spacetime, the spatial
geometry is typically introduced by stipulating the existence of a 
system of spatial coordinates \((x, y, z)\) with 
respect to which the metric is given by \(ds^{2} 
= dx^{2} + dy^{2} + dz^{2}\). These coordinates are determined up to 
a Euclidean transformation by a fundamental element of the theory, 
the spatial metric, and are hence linked to the metrical structure 
postulated by the theory. Similarly in the special theory of 
relativity, it is assumed that a system of coordinates 
\((t,x,y,z)\) exists 
with respect to which the spacetime metric is given by 
\(ds^{2} = -dt^{2} + d\overline{r} \cdot d\overline{r}\). 
These coordinates are likewise <em>theoretic</em> and are determined
up to a Poincar&eacute; transformation by the fact that they are
adapted to a fundamental element of the theory, the spacetime metric.
</p>

<p>

A <em>physical</em> coordinate system is one that makes use of 
various physical entities, bodies and fields, to assign coordinates 
to physical events. It is this kind of coordinate system that is used
by a <em>physical observer</em> to track material bodies and to 
measure various physical fields such as the electromagnetic field and
the spacetime-metric field. An example of a physical coordinate chart
is the radar tracking system that may be found at every major 
airport. A physical atlas for a region surrounding the earth is 
provided by the Global Positioning System. </p>

<p>

In the context of the theory of general relativity the metric is not 
an absolute structure with convenient global symmetries; rather, the 
metric is a dynamical entity that is coupled to the energy-momentum 
density of matter and other fields. The best we can do is to adapt to
a micro-neighborhood by employing a normal coordinate system at a 
given point. In the absence of symmetry, extended bodies adapted to 
the geometry cannot exist. Therefore, neither <em>theoretic</em> nor 
<em>physical</em> coordinate systems can be introduced early in the 
presentation of the theory of general relativity, that is, prior to 
the introduction of purely <em>formal</em> coordinates, even with the
aid of <em>ad hoc</em> assumptions; because the circumstances that 
permitted <em>ad hoc</em> assumptions in earlier spacetime theories 
are simply not available in the case of the theory of general 
relativity. Since the geometric structure in the general theory of 
relativity is part of the dynamical problem, the <em>theoretic</em> 
and <em>physical</em>coordinate systems are also part of the 
dynamical problem. The relation between the physical coordinates and 
the geometric structure in general relativity is described by a 
complicated system of functions 
\(g_{ij}(x^{i})\). The 
corresponding relationship in classical mechanics is described by a 
small number of constants; for example, 
\(g_{\alpha \beta}(x^{\alpha}) = \delta_{\alpha \beta}\) 
for the spatial metric. In 
particular, the description of physical coordinate systems in the 
theory of general relativity requires that many other physical 
entities, including the spacetime metric, the electromagnetic field, 
the world lines of material bodies and their equation-of-motion 
structures, have to be introduced and analyzed first. Clearly, such a
description and analysis of <em>these</em> physical entities must be 
carried out with respect to a purely mathematical or <em>formal</em>
system of coordinates, because <em>theoretic</em> and 
<em>physical</em> coordinates are not yet part of the model. </p>

<p>

The use of purely <em>formal</em> coordinates was not seen as 
necessary in early spacetime theories because one assumed that the 
geometric structures were flat and/or homogeneous. These assumptions 
then permitted the use of <em>theoretic</em> and <em>physical</em> 
coordinates that are adapted to the geometric structures. 
Nevertheless, and this is Weyl&rsquo;s point, in the absence of such 
<em>ad hoc</em> assumptions, such as for example, Newtons absolute 
space and time, neither <em>theoretic</em> nor <em>physical</em>
coordinate systems can be introduced prior to the introduction 
of purely <em>formal</em> coordinates, even in spacetime theories 
preceding the theory of general relativity. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-109" name="109">109.</a>
 Emphasis added. Weyl emphasized throughout his writings the 
importance of non-metrical coordinates. It is interesting to cite a 
remark by Einstein (1949, 67) in this context: </p>

<blockquote> <p>

Why were another seven years required for the construction of the 
general theory of relativity? The main reason lies in the fact that 
it is not so easy to free oneself from the idea that co-ordinates 
must have an immediate metrical meaning.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-110" name="110">110.</a>
 A similar construction occurs in Weyl&rsquo;s theoretical derivation 
of <em>Hubble&rsquo;s redshift law</em>. See &sect;4.4.7. </p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-111" name="111">111.</a>
 For more details see the discussion by Ehlers (1988) on Weyl&rsquo;s 
contributions to the theory of measurement in general relativity and 
cosmology. Referring to earlier and even some later literature on 
general relativity, Ehlers remarks, </p>

<blockquote> <p>

one finds a great deal of uncertainty concerning the question of how 
the &ldquo;mathematical formalism&rdquo; of the theory is to be 
related to observations and measurements. In particular, it was often
maintained that special coordinate systems are necessary in order to 
describe measurements. This unsatisfactory state of affairs was in 
essence overcome by Weyl. In several typical cases he explained that 
the interpretation of Einstein&rsquo;s theory is, in fact, 
unambiguous, and he showed how <em>measurable quantities </em>can and
should be expressed as <em>invariants</em>. To obtain such 
expressions, Weyl always constructs an idealized spacetime model of 
the physical process constituting the measurements, thus extending to
the general theory Minkowski&rsquo;s point of view that (classical) 
<em>physics is spacetime geometry</em>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-112" name="112">112.</a>
 (Weyl, 1949a, 116). In his intellectual autobiography Carnap (1963, 
37&ndash;38) recalls that Einstein was seriously worried about the 
problem of the Now. </p>

<blockquote> <p>

He [Einstein] explained that the experience of the Now means 
something special for man, something essentially different from the 
past and the future, but that this important difference does not and 
cannot occur within physics. That this experience cannot be grasped 
by science seemed to him a matter of painful but inevitable 
resignation. I remarked that all that occurs objectively can be 
described in science; on the one hand the temporal sequence of events
is described in physics; and, on the other hand, the peculiarities of
man&rsquo;s experiences with respect to time, including his different
attitude towards past, present and future, can be described and (in 
principle) explained in psychology. But Einstein thought that these 
scientific descriptions cannot possibly satisfy our human needs; that
there is something essential about the Now which is just outside of 
the realm of science. We both agreed that this was not a question of 
a defect for which science could be blamed, as Bergson thought. 
&hellip;&thinsp;I definitely had the impression that Einstein&rsquo;s
thinking on this point involved a lack of distinction between 
experience and knowledge. Since science in principle can say all that
can be said, there is no unanswerable question left. But though there
is no theoretical question left, there is still the common human 
emotional experience, which is sometimes disturbing for special 
psychological reasons.</p>

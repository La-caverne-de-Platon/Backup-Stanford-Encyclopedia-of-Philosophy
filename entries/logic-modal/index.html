<h1>Modal Logic</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Feb 29, 2000; substantive revision Sat Sep 8, 2018</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

A modal is an expression (like &lsquo;necessarily&rsquo; or
&lsquo;possibly&rsquo;) that is used to qualify the truth of a
judgement. Modal logic is, strictly speaking, the study of the
deductive behavior of the expressions &lsquo;it is necessary
that&rsquo; and &lsquo;it is possible that&rsquo;. However, the term
&lsquo;modal logic&rsquo; may be used more broadly for a family of
related systems. These include logics for belief, for tense and other
temporal expressions, for the deontic (moral) expressions such as
&lsquo;it is obligatory that&rsquo; and &lsquo;it is permitted
that&rsquo;, and many others. An understanding of modal logic is
particularly valuable in the formal analysis of philosophical argument,
where expressions from the modal family are both common and confusing.
Modal logic also has important applications in computer science.

Narrowly construed, modal logic studies reasoning that involves the
use of the expressions &lsquo;necessarily&rsquo; and
&lsquo;possibly&rsquo;. However, the term &lsquo;modal logic&rsquo; is
used more broadly to cover a family of logics with similar rules and a
variety of different symbols.</p>

<h2><a name="ModLog">2. Modal Logics</a></h2>

<p>

The most familiar logics in the modal family are constructed from a
weak logic called \(\bK\) (after Saul Kripke). Under the narrow
reading, modal logic concerns necessity and possibility. A variety of
different systems may be developed for such logics using
\(\bK\) as a foundation. The symbols of \(\bK\) include
&lsquo;\({\sim}\)&rsquo; for &lsquo;not&rsquo;,
&lsquo;\(\rightarrow\)&rsquo; for &lsquo;if&hellip;then&rsquo;, and
&lsquo;\(\Box\)&rsquo; for the modal operator &lsquo;it is necessary
that&rsquo;. (The connectives &lsquo;\(\amp\)&rsquo;,
&lsquo;\(\vee\)&rsquo;, and &lsquo;\(\leftrightarrow\)&rsquo; may be
defined from &lsquo;\({\sim}\)&rsquo; and
&lsquo;\(\rightarrow\)&rsquo; as is done in propositional logic.)
\(\bK\) results from adding the following to the principles of
propositional logic. </p>

<p class="indent">
Necessitation Rule: &nbsp;&nbsp;If \(A\) is a theorem
of \(\bK\), then so is \(\Box A\).</p>

<p class="indent">

Distribution Axiom: \(\Box(A\rightarrow B) \rightarrow 
(\Box A\rightarrow \Box B)\).</p>

<p>

(In these principles we use &lsquo;\(A\)&rsquo; and
&lsquo;\(B\)&rsquo; as metavariables ranging over formulas of the
language.) According to the Necessitation Rule, any theorem of logic
is necessary. The Distribution Axiom says that if it is necessary that
if \(A\) then \(B\), then if necessarily \(A\), then
necessarily \(B\).</p>

<p>

The operator \(\Diamond\) (for &lsquo;possibly&rsquo;) can be defined
from \(\Box\) by letting \(\Diamond A = {\sim}\Box{\sim}A\). In
\(\bK\), the operators \(\Box\) and \(\Diamond\) behave very much like
the quantifiers \(\forall\) (all) and \(\exists\) (some). For example,
the definition of \(\Diamond\) from \(\Box\) mirrors the equivalence
of \(\forall xA\) with \({\sim}\exists x{\sim}A\) in predicate
logic. Furthermore, \(\Box(A \amp B)\) entails \(\Box A \amp \Box B\)
and vice versa; while \(\Box A\vee \Box B\) entails \(\Box (A\vee
B)\), but <em>not</em> vice versa. This reflects the patterns
exhibited by the universal quantifier: \(\forall x(A \amp B)\) entails
\(\forall xA \amp \forall xB\) and vice versa, while \(\forall xA \vee
\forall xB\) entails \(\forall x(A \vee B)\) but not vice
versa. Similar parallels between \(\Diamond\) and \(\exists\) can be
drawn. The basis for this correspondence between the modal operators
and the quantifiers will emerge more clearly in the section on
 <a href="#PosWorSem">Possible Worlds Semantics</a>.</p>

<p>

The system \(\bK\) is too weak to provide an adequate
account of necessity. The following axiom is not provable
in \(\bK\), but it is clearly desirable.</p>

\[\tag{\(M\)}
\Box A\rightarrow A
\]

<p>

\((M)\) claims that whatever is necessary is the case. Notice
that \((M)\) would be incorrect were \(\Box\) to be read &lsquo;it
ought to be that&rsquo;, or &lsquo;it was the case that&rsquo;. So the
presence of axiom \((M)\) distinguishes logics for necessity from other logics
in the modal family. A basic modal logic \(M\) results from
adding \((M)\) to \(\bK\). (Some authors call this
system \(\mathbf{T}\).)</p>

<p>

Many logicians believe that \(M\) is still too weak to correctly
formalize the logic of necessity and possibility. They recommend
further axioms to govern the iteration, or repetition of modal
operators. Here are two of the most famous iteration axioms:</p>

\[\tag{4}
\Box A\rightarrow \Box \Box A
\]

\[\tag{5}
\Diamond A\rightarrow \Box \Diamond A
\]

<p>

\(\mathbf{S4}\) is the system that results from adding (4) to
\(M\). Similarly \(\mathbf{S5}\) is \(M\) plus (5). In
\(\mathbf{S4}\), the sentence \(\Box \Box A\) is
equivalent to \(\Box A\). As a result, any string of boxes may
be replaced by a single box, and the same goes for strings of
diamonds. This amounts to the idea that iteration of the modal
operators is superfluous. Saying that \(A\) is necessarily
necessary is considered a uselessly long-winded way of saying that
\(A\) is necessary. The system \(\mathbf{S5}\) has even
stronger principles for simplifying strings of modal operators. In
\(\mathbf{S4}\), a string of operators of <em>the same kind</em>
can be replaced for that operator; in \(\mathbf{S5}\), strings
containing both boxes and diamonds are equivalent to the last operator
in the string. So, for example, saying that it is possible that
\(A\) is necessary is the same as saying that \(A\) is
necessary. A summary of these features of \(\mathbf{S4}\) and
\(\mathbf{S5}\) follows.</p>

\[\tag{\(\mathbf{S4}\)}
\Box \Box \ldots \Box = \Box \text{ and }
\Diamond \Diamond \ldots \Diamond = \Diamond
\]

\[\begin{align*}
\tag{\(\mathbf{S5}\)}
00\ldots \Box &amp;= \Box \text{ and } 00\ldots \Diamond = \Diamond, \\
 &amp;\text{ where each } 0 \text{ is either } \Box \text{ or } \Diamond
\end{align*}\]

<p>

One could engage in endless argument over the correctness or
incorrectness of these and other iteration principles for \(\Box\) and
\(\Diamond\). The controversy can be partly resolved by recognizing that the
words &lsquo;necessarily&rsquo; and &lsquo;possibly&rsquo;, have many
different uses. So the acceptability of axioms for modal logic depends
on which of these uses we have in mind. For this reason, there is no
one modal logic, but rather a whole family of systems built around
\(M\). The relationship between these systems is diagrammed in
 <a href="#MapRelBetModLog">Section 8</a>,
 and their application to different uses of
&lsquo;necessarily&rsquo; and &lsquo;possibly&rsquo; can be more deeply
understood by studying their possible world semantics in
 <a href="#PosWorSem">Section 6</a>.</p>

<p>

The system \(\mathbf{B}\) (for the logician Brouwer) is formed by adding axiom
\((B)\) to \(M\).</p>


\[\tag{\(B\)}
A\rightarrow \Box \Diamond A
\]

<p>

It is interesting to note that \(\mathbf{S5}\) can be formulated
equivalently by adding \((B)\) to \(\mathbf{S4}\). The axiom \((B)\)
raises an important point about the interpretation of modal
formulas. \((B)\) says that if \(A\) is the case, then \(A\) is
necessarily possible. One might argue that \((B)\) should always be
adopted in any modal logic, for surely if \(A\) is the case, then it
is necessary that \(A\) is possible. However, there is a problem with
this claim that can be exposed by noting that \(\Diamond \Box
A\rightarrow A\) is provable from \((B)\). So \(\Diamond \Box
A\rightarrow A\) should be acceptable if \((B)\) is. However,
\(\Diamond \Box A\rightarrow A\) says that if \(A\) is possibly
necessary, then \(A\) is the case, and this is far from obvious. Why
does \((B)\) seem obvious, while one of the things it entails seems
not obvious at all? The answer is that there is a dangerous ambiguity
in the English interpretation of \(A\rightarrow \Box \Diamond A\). We
often use the expression &lsquo;If \(A\) then necessarily \(B\)&rsquo;
to express that the conditional &lsquo;if \(A\) then \(B\)&rsquo; is
necessary. This interpretation corresponds to \(\Box(A\rightarrow
B)\). On other occasions, we mean that if \(A\), then \(B\) is
necessary: \(A\rightarrow \Box B\). In English,
&lsquo;necessarily&rsquo; is an adverb, and since adverbs are usually
placed near verbs, we have no natural way to indicate whether the
modal operator applies to the whole conditional, or to its
consequent. For these reasons, there is a tendency to confuse \((B):
A\rightarrow \Box \Diamond A\) with \(\Box(A\rightarrow \Diamond
A)\). But \(\Box(A\rightarrow \Diamond A)\) is not the same as
\((B)\), for \(\Box(A\rightarrow \Diamond A)\) is already a theorem of
\(M\), and \((B)\) is not. One must take special care that our
positive reaction to \(\Box(A\rightarrow \Diamond A)\) does not infect
our evaluation of \((B)\). One simple way to protect ourselves is to
formulate \(B\) in an equivalent way using the axiom: \(\Diamond \Box
A\rightarrow A\), where these ambiguities of scope do not arise.</p>

<h2><a name="DeoLog">3. Deontic Logics</a></h2>

<p>

Deontic logics introduce the primitive symbol \(O\) for &lsquo;it is
obligatory that&rsquo;, from which symbols \(P\) for &lsquo;it is
permitted that&rsquo; and \(F\) for &lsquo;it is forbidden that&rsquo;
are defined: \(PA = {\sim}O{\sim}A\) and \(FA = O{\sim}A\). The
deontic analog of the modal axiom \((M): OA\rightarrow A\) is clearly
not appropriate for deontic logic. (Unfortunately, what ought to be is
not always the case.) However, a basic system \(\mathbf{D}\) of
deontic logic can be constructed by adding the weaker axiom \((D)\) to
\(\bK\).</p>

\[\tag{\(D\)}
 OA\rightarrow PA
\]

<p>

Axiom \((D)\) guarantees the consistency of the system of
obligations by insisting that when \(A\) is obligatory,
\(A\) is permissible. A system which obligates us to bring about
\(A\), but doesn&rsquo;t permit us to do so, puts us in an inescapable
bind. Although some will argue that such conflicts of obligation are
at least possible, most deontic logicians accept \((D)\).</p>

<p>

\(O(OA\rightarrow A)\) is another deontic
axiom that seems desirable. Although it is wrong to say that if
\(A\) is obligatory then \(A\) is the case
\((OA\rightarrow A)\), still, this conditional
<em>ought</em> to be the case. So some deontic logicians believe that
\(D\) needs to be supplemented with
\(O(OA\rightarrow A)\) as well.</p>

<p>

Controversy about iteration (repetition) of operators arises again in
deontic logic. In some conceptions of obligation, \(OOA\) just amounts
to \(OA\). &lsquo;It ought to be that it ought to be&rsquo; is treated
as a sort of stuttering; the extra &lsquo;ought&rsquo;s do not add
anything new. So axioms are added to guarantee the equivalence of
\(OOA\) and \(OA\). The more general iteration policy embodied in
\(\mathbf{S5}\) may also be adopted. However, there are conceptions of
obligation where distinction between \(OA\) and \(OOA\) is
preserved. The idea is that there are genuine differences between the
obligations we <em>actually</em> have and the obligations
we <em>should</em> adopt. So, for example, &lsquo;it ought to be that
it ought to be that \(A\)&rsquo; commands adoption of some obligation
which may not actually be in place, with the result that \(OOA\) can
be true even when \(OA\) is false.</p>

<h2><a name="TemLog">4. Temporal Logics</a></h2>

<p>

In temporal logic (also known as tense logic), there are two basic
operators, \(G\) for the future, and \(H\) for the past. \(G\) is read
&lsquo;it always will be that&rsquo; and the defined operator \(F\)
(read &lsquo;it will be the case that&rsquo;) can be introduced by
\(FA = {\sim}G{\sim}A\). Similarly \(H\) is read: &lsquo;it always was
that&rsquo; and \(P\) (for &lsquo;it was the case that&rsquo;) is
defined by \(PA={\sim}H{\sim}A\). A basic system of temporal logic
called \(\mathbf{Kt}\) results from adopting the principles of \(\bK\)
for both \(G\) and \(H\), along with two axioms to govern the
interaction between the past and future operators:</p>

<p class="indent">Necessitation Rules: <br />
 If \(A\) is a theorem then so are
\(GA\) and \(HA\). 
</p>

<p class="indent">
Distribution Axioms: <br />
\(G(A\rightarrow B) \rightarrow(GA\rightarrow GB)\) and
\(H(A\rightarrow B) \rightarrow (HA\rightarrow HB)\)</p>

<p class="indent">
Interaction Axioms:<br />
\(A\rightarrow GPA\) and \(A\rightarrow HFA\)</p> 

<p>

The interaction axioms raise questions concerning asymmetries between
the past and the future. A standard intuition is that the past is
fixed, while the future is still open. The first interaction axiom
\((A\rightarrow GPA)\) conforms to this
intuition in reporting that what is the case \((A)\), will at all
future times, be in the past \((GPA)\). However
\(A\rightarrow HFA\) may appear to have
unacceptably deterministic overtones, for it claims, apparently, that
what is true now \((A)\) has always been such that it will occur
in the future \((HFA)\). However, possible
world semantics for temporal logic reveals that this worry results
from a simple confusion, and that the two interaction axioms are
equally acceptable.</p>

<p>

Note that the characteristic axiom of modal logic, \((M):
\Box A\rightarrow A\), is not acceptable for either
\(H\) or \(G\), since \(A\) does not follow from
&lsquo;it always was the case that \(A\)&rsquo;, nor from
&lsquo;it always will be the case that \(A\)&rsquo;. However, it
is acceptable in a closely related temporal logic where \(G\) is
read &lsquo;it is and always will be&rsquo;, and \(H\) is read
&lsquo;it is and always was&rsquo;.</p>

<p>

Depending on which assumptions one makes about the structure of
time, further axioms must be added to temporal logics. A list of axioms
commonly adopted in temporal logics follows. An account of how they
depend on the structure of time will be found in the section
 <a href="#PosWorSem">Possible Worlds Semantics</a>.</p>

\[\begin{align*}
GA\rightarrow GGA &amp;\text{ and } HA\rightarrow HHA \\
GGA\rightarrow GA &amp;\text{ and } HHA\rightarrow HA \\
GA\rightarrow FA &amp;\text{ and } HA\rightarrow PA
\end{align*}\]

<p>

It is interesting to note that certain combinations of past tense and
future tense operators may be used to express complex tenses in
English. For example, \(FPA\), corresponds to sentence \(A\) in the
future perfect tense, (as in &lsquo;20 seconds from now the light will
have changed&rsquo;). Similarly, \(PPA\) expresses the past perfect
tense.</p>

<h2><a name="ConLog">5. Conditional and Relevance Logics</a></h2>

<p>

The founder of modal logic, C. I. Lewis, defined a series of modal
logics which did not have \(\Box\) as a primitive symbol. Lewis was
concerned to develop a logic of conditionals that was free of the so
called Paradoxes of Material Implication, namely the classical
theorems \(A\rightarrow({\sim}A\rightarrow B)\) and
\(B\rightarrow(A\rightarrow B)\). He introduced the symbol
\(\fishhook\) for &ldquo;strict implication&rdquo; and developed
logics where neither \(A\fishhook ({\sim}A\fishhook B)\) nor
\(B\fishhook (A\fishhook B)\) is provable. The modern practice has
been to define \(A\fishhook B\) by \(\Box(A\rightarrow B)\), and use
modal logics governing \(\Box\) to obtain similar results. However,
the provability of such formulas as \((A \amp{\sim}A)\fishhook B\) in
such logics seems at odds with concern for the paradoxes. Anderson and
Belnap (1975) have developed systems \(\mathbf{R}\) (for Relevance
Logic) and \(\mathbf{E}\) (for Entailment) which are designed to
overcome such difficulties. These systems require revision of the
standard systems of propositional logic. (See Mares (2004) and the
entry on
 <a href="../logic-relevance/index.html">relevance logic</a>.)</p>
 
<p>

David Lewis (1973) and others have developed 
 <a href="../logic-conditionals/index.html">conditional logics</a> 
 to handle counterfactual expressions, that is, expressions of the
form &lsquo;if \(A\) <em>were</em> to happen then \(B\) <em>would</em>
happen&rsquo;. (Kvart (1980) is another good source on the topic.)
Counterfactual logics differ from those based on strict implication
because the former reject while the latter accept contraposition.</p>

<h2><a name="PosWorSem">6. Possible Worlds Semantics</a></h2>

<p>

The purpose of logic is to characterize the difference between valid
and invalid arguments. A logical system for a language is a set of
axioms and rules designed to prove <em>exactly</em> the valid
arguments statable in the language. Creating such a logic may be a
difficult task. The logician must make sure that the system is
<em>sound</em>, i.e. that every argument proven using the rules and
axioms is in fact valid. Furthermore, the system should be
<em>complete</em>, meaning that every valid argument has a proof in
the system. Demonstrating soundness and completeness of formal systems
is a logician&rsquo;s central concern. </p>

<p>

Such a demonstration cannot get underway until the concept of validity
is defined rigorously. Formal semantics for a logic provides a
definition of validity by characterizing the truth behavior of the
sentences of the system. In propositional logic, validity can be
defined using truth tables. A valid argument is simply one where every
truth table row that makes its premises true also makes its conclusion
true. However truth tables cannot be used to provide an account of
validity in modal logics because there are no truth tables for
expressions such as &lsquo;it is necessary that&rsquo;, &lsquo;it is
obligatory that&rsquo;, and the like. (The problem is that the truth
value of \(A\) does not determine the truth value for \(\Box A\). For
example, when \(A\) is &lsquo;Dogs are dogs&rsquo;, \(\Box A\) is
true, but when \(A\) is &lsquo;Dogs are pets&rsquo;, \(\Box A\) is
false.) Nevertheless, semantics for modal logics can be defined by
introducing possible worlds. We will illustrate possible worlds
semantics for a logic of necessity containing the symbols \({\sim},
\rightarrow\), and \(\Box\). Then we will explain how the same
strategy may be adapted to other logics in the modal family.</p>

<p>

In propositional logic, a valuation of the atomic sentences (or row of
a truth table) assigns a truth value \((T\) or \(F)\) to
each propositional variable \(p\). Then the truth values of the
complex sentences are calculated with truth tables. In modal semantics,
a set \(W\) of possible worlds is introduced. A valuation then
gives a truth value to each propositional variable <em>for each of the
possible worlds</em> in \(W\). This means that value assigned to
\(p\) for world \(w\) may differ from the value assigned to
\(p\) for another world \(w'\).</p>

<p>

The truth value of the atomic sentence \(p\) at world \(w\) given by
the valuation \(v\) may be written \(v(p, w)\). Given this notation,
the truth values \((T\) for true, \(F\) for false) of complex
sentences of modal logic for a given valuation \(v\) (and member \(w\)
of the set of worlds \(W)\) may be defined by the following truth
clauses. (&lsquo;iff&rsquo; abbreviates &lsquo;if and only
if&rsquo;.)</p>

\[\tag{\({\sim}\)}
v({\sim}A, w)=T \text{ iff } v(A, w)=F.
\]

\[\tag{\(\rightarrow\)}
v(A\rightarrow B, w)=T \text{ iff } v(A, w)=F \text{ or } v(B, w)=T.
\]

\[\tag{5}
v(\Box A, w)=T \text{ iff for every world } w' \text{ in } W, v(A, w')=T.
\]

<p>

Clauses \(({\sim})\) and \((\rightarrow)\) simply describe the
standard truth table behavior for negation and material implication
respectively. According to (5), \(\Box A\) is true (at a world \(w)\)
exactly when \(A\) is true in <em>all</em> possible worlds. Given the
definition of \(\Diamond\), (namely, \(\Diamond A =
{\sim}\Box{\sim}A)\) the truth condition (5) insures that \(\Diamond
A\) is true just in case \(A\) is true in <em>some</em> possible
world. Since the truth clauses for \(\Box\) and \(\Diamond\) involve
the quantifiers &lsquo;all&rsquo; and &lsquo;some&rsquo;
(respectively), the parallels in logical behavior between \(\Box\) and
\(\forall x\), and between \(\Diamond\) and \(\exists x\) noted in
section 2 will be expected.</p>

<p>

Clauses \(({\sim}), (\rightarrow)\), and (5) allow us to calculate the truth value
of any sentence at any world on a given valuation. A definition of
validity is now just around the corner. An argument is <em>5-valid for
a given set W</em> (of possible worlds) if and only if every valuation
of the atomic sentences that assigns the premises \(T\) at a
world in \(W\) also assigns the conclusion \(T\) at the same
world. An argument is said to be <em>5-valid</em> iff it is valid for
every non empty set \(W\) of possible worlds.</p>

<p>

It has been shown that \(\mathbf{S5}\) is sound and complete for
5-validity (hence our use of the symbol &lsquo;5&rsquo;). The 5-valid
arguments are exactly the arguments provable in
\(\mathbf{S5}\). This result suggests that \(\mathbf{S5}\) is
the correct way to formulate a logic of necessity.</p>

<p>

However, \(\mathbf{S5}\) is not a reasonable logic for all members
of the modal family. In deontic logic, temporal logic, and others, the
analog of the truth condition (5) is clearly not appropriate;
furthermore there are even conceptions of necessity where (5) should
be rejected as well. The point is easiest to see in the case of
temporal logic. Here, the members of \(W\) are moments of time,
or worlds &ldquo;frozen&rdquo;, as it were, at an instant. For simplicity let us
consider a <em>future</em> temporal logic, a logic where
\(\Box A\) reads: &lsquo;it <em>will</em> always be the case
that&rsquo;. (We formulate the system using \(\Box\) rather than the
traditional \(G\) so that the connections with other modal logics
will be easier to appreciate.) The correct clause for \(\Box\) should
say that \(\Box A\) is true at time \(w\) iff \(A\)
is true at all times <em>in the future of</em> \(w\). To restrict
attention to the future, the relation \(R\) (for &lsquo;earlier
than&rsquo;) needs to be introduced. Then the correct clause can be
formulated as follows.</p>

\[\tag{\(K\)}
 v(\Box A, w)=T \text{ iff for every } w',
 \text{ if } wRw', \text{ then } v(A, w')=T.
\]

<p>

This says that \(\Box A\) is true at \(w\) just in case
\(A\) is true at all times <em>after</em> \(w\).</p>

<p>

Validity for this brand of temporal logic can now be defined. A
<em>frame</em> \(\langle W, R\rangle\) is a pair consisting of a non-empty set
\(W\) (of worlds) and a binary relation \(R\) on
\(W\). A <em>model</em> \(\langle F, v\rangle\) consists of a frame \(F\), and
a valuation \(v\) that assigns truth values to each atomic sentence at
each world in \(W\). Given a model, the values of all complex
sentences can be determined using \(({\sim}), (\rightarrow)\), and
\((K)\). An argument is \(\bK\)-valid just in case any model whose
valuation assigns the premises \(T\) at a world also assigns the
conclusion \(T\) at the same world. As the reader may have guessed
from our use of &lsquo;\(\bK\)&rsquo;, it has been shown that the
simplest modal logic \(\bK\) is both sound and complete for
\(\bK\)-validity.</p>

<h2><a name="ModAxiConFra">7. Modal Axioms and Conditions on Frames</a></h2>

<p>

One might assume from this discussion that \(\bK\) is the correct
logic when \(\Box\) is read &lsquo;it will always be the case
that&rsquo;. However, there are reasons for thinking that \(\bK\) is
too weak. One obvious logical feature of the relation \(R\) (earlier
than) is transitivity. If \(wRv (w\) is earlier than \(v)\) and \(vRu
(v\) is earlier than \(u)\), then it follows that \(wRu (w\) is
earlier than \(u)\). So let us define a new kind of validity that
corresponds to this condition on \(R\). Let a 4-model be any model
whose frame \(\langle W, R\rangle\) is such that \(R\) is a transitive
relation on \(W\). Then an argument is 4-valid iff any 4-model whose
valuation assigns \(T\) to the premises at a world also assigns \(T\)
to the conclusion at the same world. We use &lsquo;4&rsquo; to
describe such a transitive model because the logic which is adequate
(both sound and complete) for 4-validity is \(\mathbf{K4}\), the logic
which results from adding the axiom (4): \(\Box A\rightarrow \Box \Box
A\) to \(\bK\).</p>

<p>

Transitivity is not the only property which we might want to require
of the frame \(\langle W, R\rangle\) if \(R\) is to be read &lsquo;earlier
than&rsquo; and \(W\) is a set of moments. One condition (which is
only mildly controversial) is that there is no last moment of time,
i.e. that for every world \(w\) there is some world \(v\) such that
\(wRv\). This condition on frames is called
<em>seriality.</em> Seriality corresponds to the axiom \((D): \Box
A\rightarrow \Diamond A\), in the same way that transitivity
corresponds to (4). A \(\mathbf{D}\)-model is a \(\bK\)-model with a
serial frame. From the concept of a \(\mathbf{D}\)-model the
corresponding notion of \(\mathbf{D}\)-validity can be defined just as
we did in the case of 4-validity. As you probably guessed, the system
that is adequate with respect to \(\mathbf{D}\)-validity is
\(\mathbf{KD}\), or \(\bK\) plus \((D)\). Not only that, but the
system \(\mathbf{KD4}\) (that is \(\bK\) plus (4) and \((D))\) is
adequate with respect to \(\mathbf{D4}\)-validity, where a
\(\mathbf{D4}\)-model is one where \(\langle W, R\rangle\) is <em>both</em>
serial and transitive.</p>

<p>

Another property which we might want for the relation &lsquo;earlier
than&rsquo; is density, the condition which says that between any two
times we can always find another. Density would be false if time were
atomic, i.e. if there were intervals of time which could not be broken
down into any smaller parts. Density corresponds to the axiom
\((C4): \Box \Box A\rightarrow \Box A\), the
converse of (4), so for example, the system \(\mathbf{KC4}\),
which is \(\bK\) plus \((C4)\) is adequate with
respect to models where the frame \(\langle W, R\rangle\) is
dense, and \(\mathbf{KDC4}\), adequate with respect to models
whose frames are serial and dense, and so on.</p>

<p>

Each of the modal logic axioms we have discussed corresponds to a
condition on frames in the same way. The relationship between
conditions on frames and corresponding axioms is one of the central
topics in the study of modal logics. Once an interpretation of the
intensional operator \(\Box\) has been decided on, the appropriate
conditions on \(R\) can be determined to fix the corresponding
notion of validity. This, in turn, allows us to select the right set
of axioms for that logic.</p>

<p>

For example, consider a deontic logic, where \(\Box\) is read
&lsquo;it is obligatory that&rsquo;. Here the truth of \(\Box A\) does
not demand the truth of \(A\) in <em>every</em> possible world, but
only in a subset of those worlds where people do what they ought. So
we will want to introduce a relation \(R\) for this kind of logic as
well, and use the truth clause \((K)\) to evaluate \(\Box A\) at a
world. However, in this case, \(R\) is not earlier than. Instead
\(wRw'\) holds just in case world \(w'\) is a morally acceptable
variant of \(w\), i.e. a world that our actions can bring about which
satisfies what is morally correct, or right, or just. Under such a
reading, it should be clear that the relevant frames should obey
seriality, the condition that requires that each possible world have a
morally acceptable variant. The analysis of the properties desired for
\(R\) makes it clear that a basic deontic logic can be formulated by
adding the axiom \((D)\) and to \(\bK\).</p>

<p>

Even in modal logic, one may wish to restrict the range of possible
worlds which are relevant in determining whether \(\Box A\) is true at
a given world. For example, I might say that it is necessary for me to
pay my bills, even though I know full well that there is a possible
world where I fail to pay them. In ordinary speech, the claim that
\(A\) is necessary does not require the truth of \(A\) in <em>all</em>
possible worlds, but rather only in a certain class of worlds which I
have in mind (for example, worlds where I avoid penalties for failure
to pay). In order to provide a generic treatment of necessity, we must
say that \(\Box A\) is true in \(w\) iff \(A\) is true in all
worlds <em>that are related</em> to \(w\) in the right way. So for an
operator \(\Box\) interpreted as necessity, we introduce a
corresponding relation \(R\) on the set of possible worlds \(W\),
traditionally called the accessibility relation. The accessibility
relation \(R\) holds between worlds \(w\) and \(w'\) iff \(w'\) is
possible given the facts of \(w\). Under this reading for \(R\), it
should be clear that frames for modal logic should be reflexive. It
follows that modal logics should be founded on \(M\), the system that
results from adding \((M)\) to \(\bK\). Depending on exactly how the
accessibility relation is understood, symmetry and transitivity may
also be desired.</p>

<p>

A list of some of the more commonly discussed conditions on frames
and their corresponding axioms along with a map showing the
relationship between the various modal logics can be found in the next
section.</p>

<h2><a name="MapRelBetModLog">8. Map of the Relationships Between Modal Logics</a></h2>

<p>

The following diagram shows the relationships between the best known
modal logics, namely logics that can be formed by adding a selection
of the axioms \((D), (M)\), (4), \((B)\) and (5) to
\(\bK\). A list of these (and other) axioms along with
their corresponding frame conditions can be found below the diagram.</p>

<div class="figure">
 <img alt="missing text, please inform" src="ModalLogic1.gif" />
<p class="center"><span class="figlabel">Diagram of Modal Logics</span></p>
</div>

<p>

In this chart, systems are given by the list of their axioms. So, for
example \(\mathbf{M4B}\) is the result of adding \((M)\), (4) and
\((B)\) to \(\bK\). In boldface, we have indicated traditional names
of some systems. When system \(\mathbf{S}\) appears below and/or to
the left of \(\mathbf{S}'\) connected by a line, then \(\mathbf{S}'\)
is an extension of \(\mathbf{S}\). This means that every argument
provable in \(\mathbf{S}\) is provable in \(\mathbf{S}'\), but
\(\mathbf{S}\) is weaker than \(\mathbf{S}'\), i.e. not all arguments
provable in \(\mathbf{S}'\) are provable in \(\mathbf{S}\).</p>

The following list indicates axioms, their names, and the
corresponding conditions on the accessibility relation \(R\), for

In the list of conditions on frames, and in the rest of this article,
the variables &lsquo;\(w\)&rsquo;, &lsquo;\(v\)&rsquo;,
&lsquo;\(u\)&rsquo;, &lsquo;\(x\)&rsquo; and the quantifier
&lsquo;\(\exists u\)&rsquo; are understood to range over
\(W\). &lsquo;&amp;&rsquo; abbreviates &lsquo;and&rsquo; and
&lsquo;\(\Rightarrow\)&rsquo; abbreviates
&lsquo;if&hellip;then&rsquo;.</p>

<p>

The notion of correspondence between axioms and frame conditions that
is at issue here was explained in the previous section. When S is a
list of axioms and F(S) is the corresponding set of frame conditions,
then S corresponds to F(S) exactly when the system K+S is adequate
(sound and complete) for F(S)-validity, that is, an argument is
provable in K+S iff it is F(S)-valid. Several stronger notions of
correspondence between axioms and frame conditions have emerged in
research on modal logic. </p>

<h2><a name="GenAxi">9. The General Axiom</a></h2>

<p>

The correspondence between axioms and conditions on frames may seem
something of a mystery. A beautiful result of Lemmon and Scott (1977)
goes a long way towards explaining those relationships. Their theorem
concerned axioms which have the following form: </p>

\[\tag{\(G\)}
\Diamond^h \Box^i A \rightarrow \Box^j\Diamond^k A
\]

<p>

We use the notation &lsquo;\(\Diamond^n\)&rsquo; to represent \(n\)
diamonds in a row, so, for example, &lsquo;\(\Diamond^3\)&rsquo;
abbreviates a string of three diamonds: &lsquo;\(\Diamond \Diamond
\Diamond\)&rsquo;. Similarly &lsquo;\(\Box^n\)&rsquo; represents a
string of \(n\) boxes. When the values of \(h, i, j\), and \(k\) are
all 1, we have axiom \((C)\):</p>

\[\tag{\(C\)}
\Diamond \Box A \rightarrow \Box \Diamond A = \Diamond^1\Box^1 A \rightarrow \Box^1\Diamond^1 A
\]

<p>

The axiom \((B)\) results from setting \(h\) and \(i\)
to 0, and letting \(j\) and \(k\) be 1:</p>

\[\tag{\(B\)}
A \rightarrow \Box \Diamond A = \Diamond^0\Box^0 A \rightarrow \Box^1\Diamond^1 A
\]

<p>

To obtain (4), we may set \(h\) and \(k\) to 0, set
\(i\) to 1 and \(j\) to 2:</p>

\[\tag{4}
\Box A \rightarrow \Box \Box A = \Diamond^0\Box^1 A \rightarrow \Box^2\Diamond^0 A
\]

<p>

Many (but not all) axioms of modal logic can be obtained by setting the
right values for the parameters in \((G)\) </p>

<p>

Our next task will be to give the condition on frames which
corresponds to \((G)\) for a given selection of values for \(h, i,
j\), and \(k\). In order to do so, we will need a definition. The
composition of two relations \(R\) and \(R'\) is a new relation \(R
\circ R'\) which is defined as follows:</p>

\[
wR \circ R'v \text{ iff for some } u, wRu \text{ and } uR'v.
\]

<p>

For example, if \(R\) is the relation of being a brother, and \(R'\)
is the relation of being a parent then \(R \circ R'\) is the relation
of being an uncle, (because \(w\) is the uncle of \(v\) iff for some
person \(u\), both \(w\) is the brother of \(u\) and \(u\) is the
parent of \(v)\). A relation may be composed with itself. For example,
when \(R\) is the relation of being a parent, then \(R \circ R\) is
the relation of being a grandparent, and \(R \circ R \circ R\) is the
relation of being a great-grandparent. It will be useful to write
&lsquo;\(R^n\)&rsquo;, for the result of composing \(R\) with itself
\(n\) times. So \(R^2\) is \(R \circ R\), and \(R^4\) is \(R \circ R
\circ R \circ R\). We will let \(R^1\) be \(R\), and \(R^0\) will be
the identity relation, i.e. \(wR^0 v\) iff \(w=v\).</p>

<p>

We may now state the Scott-Lemmon result. It is that the condition
on frames which corresponds exactly to any axiom of the shape \((G)\) is
the following.</p>

\[\tag{\(hijk\)-Convergence}
wR^h v \amp wR^j u \Rightarrow \exists x (vR^i x \amp uR^k x)
\]

<p>

It is interesting to see how the familiar conditions on \(R\) result
from setting the values for \(h\), \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) according to the
values in the corresponding axiom. For example, consider (5). In this
case \(i=0\), and \(h=j=k=1\). So the corresponding condition is</p>

\[
wRv \amp wRu \Rightarrow \exists x (vR^0 x \amp uRx).
\]

<p>

We have explained that \(R^0\) is the identity relation. So if \(vR^0
x\) then \(v=x\). But \(\exists x (v=x \amp uRx)\), is equivalent to
\(uRv\), and so the Euclidean condition is obtained:</p>

\[
(wRv \amp wRu) \Rightarrow uRv.
\]

<p>

In the case of axiom (4), \(h=0, i=1, j=2\) and \(k=0\). So the
corresponding condition on frames is</p>

\[
(w=v \amp wR^2 u) \Rightarrow \exists x (vRx \amp u=x).
\]

<p>

Resolving the identities this amounts to: </p>

\[
vR^2 u \Rightarrow vRu.
\]

<p>

By the definition of \(R^2, vR^2 u\) iff \(\exists x(vRx \amp xRu)\),
so this comes to:</p>

\[
\exists x(vRx \amp xRu) \Rightarrow vRu,
\]

<p>

which by predicate logic, is equivalent to transitivity. </p>

\[
vRx \amp xRu \Rightarrow vRu.
\]

<p>

The reader may find it a pleasant exercise to see how the
corresponding conditions fall out of hijk-Convergence when the values
of the parameters \(h\), \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\)
are set by other axioms.</p>

<p>

The Scott-Lemmon results provides a quick method for establishing
results about the relationship between axioms and their corresponding
frame conditions. Since they showed the adequacy of any logic that
extends \(\bK\) with a selection of axioms of the form \((G)\) with
respect to models that satisfy the corresponding set of frame
conditions, they provided &ldquo;wholesale&rdquo; adequacy proofs for
the majority of systems in the modal family. Sahlqvist (1975) has
discovered important generalizations of the Scott-Lemmon result
covering a much wider range of axiom types.</p>

<p>
The reader should be warned, however, that the neat correspondence
between axioms and conditions on frames is atypical. There are
condtions on frames that correspond to no axioms, and there are even
conditions on frames for which no system is adequate. (For an example
see Boolos, 1993, pp. 148ff.)</p>

<h2><a name="TwoD">10. Two Dimensional Semantics</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="../two-dimensional-semantics/index.html">Two dimensional semantics</a>
is a variant of possible world semantics that uses two (or more) kinds
of parameters in truth evaluation, rather than possible worlds alone.
For example, a logic of indexical expressions, such as
&lsquo;I&rsquo;, &lsquo;here&rsquo;, &lsquo;now&rsquo;, and the like,
needs to bring in the linguistic context (or context for short).
Given a context \(c = \langle s, p, t\rangle\) where
\(s\) is the speaker, \(p\) the place, and \(t\) the time of
utterance, then &lsquo;I&rsquo; refers to \(s\), &lsquo;here&rsquo;
to \(p\), and &lsquo;now&rsquo; to \(t\). So in the context
\(c = \langle\)Jim Garson, Houston, 3:00 P.M. CST on 4/3/\(2014\rangle\)
&lsquo;I am here now&rsquo; is T iff Jim Garson is in Houston, at 3:00
P.M. CST on 4/3/2014.</p>

<p> 
In possible worlds semantics, a sentence&rsquo;s truth-value depended on the
world at which it is evaluated. However, indexicals bring in a second
dimension &ndash; so we need to generalize again. Kaplan (1989) defines the
character of a sentence B to be a function from the set of
(linguistic) contexts to the content (or intension) of B, where the
content, in turn, is simply the intension of B, that is a function
from possible worlds to truth-values. Here, truth evaluation is
doubly dependent &ndash; on both linguistic contexts and possible worlds.</p>

<p>
One of Kaplan&rsquo;s most interesting observations is that some indexical
sentences are contingent, but at the same time analytically true. An
example is (1).</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(1)</span>
<span class="sen">
I am here now.
</span></li>
</ul>


<p>
Just from the meaning of the words, you can see that (1) must be true
in any context \(c = \langle s, p, t\rangle\). After
all, \(c\) counts as a linguistic context just in case \(s\) is
a speaker who is at place \(p\) at time \(t\). Therefore (1) is
true at \(c\), and that means that the pattern of truth-values (1)
has along the context dimension must be all Ts (given the possible
world is held fixed). This suggests that the context dimension is apt
for tracking analytic knowledge obtained from the mastery of our
language. On the other hand, the possible-worlds dimension keeps
track of what is necessary. Holding the context fixed, there there
are possible worlds where (1) is false. For example, when \(c = \langle\)Jim Garson, Houston, 3:00 P.M. CST on 4/3/\(2014\rangle\), (1) fails at
\(c\) in a possible world where Jim Garson is in Boston at 3:00
P.M. CST on 4/3/2014. It follows that &lsquo;I am here now&rsquo; is
a contingent analytic truth. Therefore, two-dimensional semantics can
handle situations where necessity and analyticity come apart.</p>

<p>
Another example where bringing in two dimension is useful is in the
logic for an open future (Thomason, 1984; Belnap, et al., 2001).
Here one employs a temporal structure where many possible future
histories extend from a given time. Consider (2).</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(2)</span>
    <span class="sen">
Joe will order a sea battle tomorrow.
</span></li>
</ul>


<p> If (2) is contingent, then there is a possible history where the
battle occurs the day after the time of evaluation, and another one
where it does not occur then. So to evaluate (2) you need to know two
things: what is the time t of evaluation, and which of the histories h
that run through t is the one to be considered. So a sentence in such
a logic is evaluated at a pair \(\langle t, h\rangle\).</p>

<p>
Another problem resolved by two-dimensional semantics is the
interaction between &lsquo;now&rsquo; and other temporal expressions
like the future tense &lsquo;it will be the case that&rsquo;. Then it
is plausible to think that &lsquo;now&rsquo; refers to the time of
evaluation. So we would have the following truth condition:</p>

\[\tag{Now}
v(\text{Now} B, t)=\mathrm{T} \text{ iff } v(B, t)=\mathrm{T}.
\]

<p>
However this will not work for sentences like (3).</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(3)</span>
    <span class="sen">
At some point in the future, everyone now living will be unknown.
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
With \(\mathrm{F}\) as the future tense operator, (3) might be
translated:</p>

\[\tag{\(3'\)}
\mathrm{F}\forall x(\text{Now} Lx \rightarrow Ux).
\]

<p>
(The correct translation cannot be \(\forall x(\text{Now} Lx
\rightarrow \mathrm{F}Ux)\), with \(\mathrm{F}\) taking narrow scope,
because (3) says there is a future time when all things now living are
unknown together, not that each living thing will be unknown in some
future time of its own). When the truth conditions for (3)\('\)
calculated, using (Now) and the truth condition (\(\mathrm{F}\)) for
\(\mathrm{F}\), it turns out that (3)\('\) is true at time \(u\) iff
there is a time \(t\) after \(u\) such that everything that is living
at \(t\) (not \(u\)!)  is unknown at \(t\).</p>

\[\tag{F}
v(\mathrm{F}B, t)=\mathrm{T} \text{ iff for some time } u
 \text{ later than } t, v(B, u)=\mathrm{T}.
\]

<p>
To evaluate (3)\('\) correctly so that it matches what we mean by
(3), we must make sure that &lsquo;now&rsquo; always refers back to
the original time of utterance when &lsquo;now&rsquo; lies in the
scope of other temporal operators such as F. Therefore we need to
keep track of which time is the time of utterance \((u)\) as well
as which time is the time of evaluation \((t)\). So our indices
take the form of a pair \(\langle u,
e\rangle\), where \(u\) is the time of utterance, and \(e\) is the time of
evaluation. Then the truth condition (Now) is revised to (2DNow).</p>

\[\tag{2DNow}
v(\text{Now} B, \langle u, e\rangle)=\mathrm{T}
 \text{ iff } v(B, \langle u, u\rangle)=\mathrm{T}.
\]

<p>
This has it that the Now\(B\) is true at a time u of utterance and
time e of evaluation provided that B is true when u is taken to be the
time of evaluation. When the truth conditions for F, \(\forall\), and
\(\rightarrow\) are revised in the obvious way (just ignore the u in
the pair), (3)\('\) is true at \(\langle u, e\rangle\) provided that
there is a time \(e'\) later than e such that everything that is
living at \(u\) is unknown at \(e'\). By carrying along a record of
what \(u\) is during the truth calculation, we can always fix the
value for &lsquo;now&rsquo; to the original time of utterance, even
when &lsquo;now&rsquo; is deeply embedded in other temporal
operators.</p>

<p>
A similar phenomenon arises in modal logics with an actuality operator
A (read &lsquo;it is actually the case that&rsquo;). To properly evaluate
(4) we need to keep track of which world is taken to be the actual (or
real) world as well as which one is taken to the world of evaluation.</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">(4)</span>
    <span class="sen">
It is possible that everyone actually living be unknown.
</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
The idea of distinguishing different possible world dimensions in
semantics has had useful applications in philosophy. For example,
Chalmers (1996) has presented arguments from the conceivability of
(say) zombies to dualist conclusions in the philosophy of mind.
Chalmers (2006) has deployed two-dimensional semantics to help
identify an a priori aspect of meaning that would support such
conclusions.</p>

<p> 
The idea has also been deployed in the philosophy of language. Kripke
(1980) famously argued that &lsquo;Water is H2O&rsquo; is a posteriori
but nevertheless a necessary truth, for given that water just is H20,
the there is no possible world where THAT stuff is (say) a basic
element as the Greeks thought. On the other hand, there is a strong
intuition that had the real world been somewhat different from what it
is, the odorless liquid that falls from the sky as rain, fills our
lakes and rivers, etc. might perfectly well have been an element. So
in some sense it is conceivable that water is not H20. Two
dimensional semantics makes room for these intuitions by providing a
separate dimension that tracks a conception of water that lays aside
the chemical nature of what water actually is. Such a &lsquo;narrow
content&rsquo; account of the meaning of &lsquo;water&rsquo; can
explain how one may display semantical competence in the use of that
term and still be ignorant about the chemistry of water (Chalmers,
2002).</p>

<h2><a name="ProLog">11. Provability Logics</a></h2>

<p>

Modal logic has been useful in clarifying our understanding of central
results concerning provability in the foundations of mathematics
(Boolos, 1993). Provability logics are systems where the propositional
variables \(p, q, r\), etc. range over formulas
of some mathematical system, for example Peano&rsquo;s system
\(\mathbf{PA}\) for arithmetic. (The system chosen for mathematics
might vary, but assume it is \(\mathbf{PA}\) for this discussion.)
G&ouml;del showed that arithmetic has strong expressive powers. Using
code numbers for arithmetic sentences, he was able to demonstrate a
correspondence between sentences of mathematics and facts about which
sentences are and are not provable in \(\mathbf{PA}\). For
example, he showed there there is a sentence \(C\) that is true
just in case no contradiction is provable in \(\mathbf{PA}\) and
there is a sentence \(G\) (the famous G&ouml;del sentence) that
is true just in case it is not provable in \(\mathbf{PA}\).</p>

<p>

In provability logics, \(\Box p\) is interpreted as a formula (of
arithmetic) that expresses that what \(p\) denotes is provable in
\(\mathbf{PA}\). Using this notation, sentences of provability logic
express facts about provability. Suppose that \(\bot\) is a constant
of provability logic denoting a contradiction. Then \({\sim}\Box
\bot\) says that \(\mathbf{PA}\) is consistent and \(\Box A\rightarrow
A\) says that \(\mathbf{PA}\) is sound in the sense that when it
proves \(A, A\) is indeed true. Furthermore, the box may be
iterated. So, for example, \(\Box{\sim}\Box \bot\) makes the dubious
claim that \(\mathbf{PA}\) is able to prove its own consistency, and
\({\sim}\Box \bot \rightarrow{\sim}\Box{\sim}\Box \bot\) asserts
(correctly as G&ouml;del proved) that if \(\mathbf{PA}\) is consistent
then \(\mathbf{PA}\) is unable to prove its own consistency.</p>

<p>

Although provability logics form a family of related systems, the
system \(\mathbf{GL}\) is by far the best known. It results from
adding the following axiom to \(\bK\):</p>

\[\tag{\(GL\)} 
 \Box(\Box A\rightarrow A)\rightarrow \Box A
\]

<p>

The axiom (4): \(\Box A\rightarrow \Box \Box A\) is provable in
\(\mathbf{GL}\), so \(\mathbf{GL}\) is actually a strengthening of
\(\mathbf{K4}\). However, axioms such as \((M): \Box A\rightarrow A\),
and even the weaker \((D): \Box A\rightarrow \Diamond A\) are not
available (nor desirable) in \(\mathbf{GL}\). In provability logic,
provability is not to be treated as a brand of necessity. The reason
is that when \(p\) is provable in an arbitrary system \(\mathbf{S}\)
for mathematics, it does not follow that \(p\) is true, since
\(\mathbf{S}\) may be unsound. Furthermore, if \(p\) is provable in
\(\mathbf{S} (\Box p)\) it need not even follow that \({\sim}p\) lacks
a proof \(({\sim}\Box{\sim}p = \Diamond p). \mathbf{S}\) might be
inconsistent and so prove both \(p\) and \({\sim}p\).</p>

<p>

Axiom \((GL)\) captures the content of Loeb&rsquo;s Theorem, an
important result in the foundations of arithmetic. \(\Box A\rightarrow
A\) says that \(\mathbf{PA}\) is sound for \(A\), i.e. that if \(A\)
were proven, A would be true. (Such a claim might not be secure for an
arbitrarily selected system \(\mathbf{S}\), since A might be provable
in \(\mathbf{S}\) and false.) \((GL)\) claims that if \(\mathbf{PA}\)
manages to prove the sentence that claims soundness for a given
sentence \(A\), then \(A\) is already provable in
\(\mathbf{PA}\). Loeb&rsquo;s Theorem reports a kind of modesty on
\(\mathbf{PA}\)&rsquo;s part (Boolos, 1993, p. 55). \(\mathbf{PA}\)
never insists (proves) that a proof of \(A\) entails \(A\)&rsquo;s
truth, unless it already has a proof of \(A\) to back up that
claim.</p>

<p>

It has been shown that \(\mathbf{GL}\) is adequate for provability
in the following sense. Let a sentence of \(\mathbf{GL}\) be
<em>always provable</em> exactly when the sentence of arithmetic it
denotes is provable no matter how its variables are assigned values to
sentences of \(\mathbf{PA}\). Then the provable sentences of
\(\mathbf{GL}\) are exactly the sentences that are always
provable. This adequacy result has been extremely useful, since
general questions concerning provability in \(\mathbf{PA}\) can be
transformed into easier questions about what can be demonstrated in
\(\mathbf{GL}\).</p>

<p>

\(\mathbf{GL}\) can also be outfitted with a possible world
semantics for which it is sound and complete. A corresponding
condition on frames for \(\mathbf{GL}\)-validity is that the frame
be transitive, finite and irreflexive.</p>

<h2><a name="AdvModLog">12. Advanced Modal Logic</a></h2>

<p>

 The applications of modal logic to mathematics and computer science
have become increasingly important. Provability logic is only one
example of this trend. The term &ldquo;advanced modal logic&rdquo;
refers to a tradition in modal logic research that is particularly
well represented in departments of mathematics and computer
science. This tradition has been woven into the history of modal logic
right from its beginnings (Goldblatt, 2006). Research into
relationships with topology and algebras represents some of the very
first technical work on modal logic. However the term &lsquo;advanced
modal logic&rsquo; generally refers to a second wave of work done
since the mid 1970s. Some examples of the many interesting topics
dealt with include results on decidability (whether it is possible to
compute whether a formula of a given modal logic is a theorem) and
complexity (the costs in time and memory needed to compute such facts
about modal logics).</p>

<h2><a name="Bis">13. Bisimulation</a></h2>

<p>

Bisimulation provides a good example of the fruitful interactions that
have been developed between modal logic and computer science. In
computer science, labeled transition systems (LTSs) are commonly used
to represent possible computation pathways during execution of a
program. LTSs are generalizations of Kripke frames, consisting of a
set \(W\) of states, and a collection of \(i\)-accessibility relations
\(R_i\), one for each computer process \(i\). Intuitively, \(wR_i w'\)
holds exactly when \(w'\) is a state that results from applying the
process \(i\) to state \(w\).</p>

<p>

The language of poly-modal or dynamic logic introduces a collection of
modal operators \(\Box_i\), one for each program \(i\) (Harel,
1984). Then \(\Box_i\)A states that sentence \(A\) holds in every
result of applying \(i\). So ideas like the correctness and successful
termination of programs can be expressed in this language. Models for
such a language are like Kripke models save that LTSs are used in
place of frames. A <em>bisimulation</em> is a counterpart relation
between states of two such models such that exactly the same
propositional variables are true in counterpart states, and whenever
world \(v\) is \(i\)-accessible from one of two counterpart states,
then the other counterpart bears the \(i\)-accessibility relation to
some counterpart of \(v\). In short, the \(i\)-accessibility structure
one can &ldquo;see&rdquo; from a given state mimics what one sees from
a counterpart. Bisimulation is a weaker notion than isomorphism (a
bisimulation relation need not be 1-1), but it is sufficient to
guarantee equivalence in processing.</p>

<p>

In the 1970s, a version of bisimulation had already been developed by
modal logicians to help better understand the relationship between
modal logic axioms and their corresponding conditions on Kripke
frames. Kripke&rsquo;s semantics provides a basis for translating
modal axioms into sentences of a second-order language where
quantification is allowed over one-place predicate letters
\(P\). Replace metavariables \(A\) with open sentences \(Px\),
translate \(\Box Px\) to \(\forall y(Rxy \rightarrow Py)\), and close
free variables \(x\) and predicate letters \(P\) with universal
quantifiers. For example, the predicate logic translation of the axiom
schema \(\Box A\rightarrow A\) comes to \(\forall P \forall x[\forall
y(Rxy\rightarrow Py) \rightarrow Px\)]. Given this translation, one
may instantiate the variable \(P\) to an arbitrary one-place
predicate, for example to the predicate \(Rx\) whose extension is the
set of all worlds w such that \(Rxw\) for a given value of
\(x\). Then one obtains \(\forall x[\forall y(Rxy\rightarrow Rxy)
\rightarrow Rxx\)], which reduces to \(\forall xRxx\), since \(\forall
y(Rxy\rightarrow Rxy)\) is a tautology. This illuminates the
correspondence between \(\Box A\rightarrow A\) and reflexivity of
frames \((\forall xRxx)\). Similar results hold for many other axioms
and frame conditions. The &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; of second-order axiom
conditions to first order frame conditions is very helpful in
obtaining completeness results for modal logics. For example, this is
the core idea behind the elegant results of Sahlqvist (1975).</p>

<p>

But when does the second-order translation of an axiom reduce to a
first-order condition on \(R\) in this way? In the 1970s, van
Benthem showed that this happens iff the translation&rsquo;s holding in a
model entails its holding in any bisimular model, where two models are
bisimular iff there is a bisimulation between them in the special case
where there is a single accessibility relation. That result
generalizes easily to the poly-modal case (Blackburn et. al., 2001, p. 103). 
This suggests that poly-modal logic lies at exactly the right
level of abstraction to describe, and reason about, computation and
other processes. (After all, what really matters there is the
preservation of truth values of formulas in models rather than the
finer details of the frame structures.) Furthermore the implicit
translation of those logics into well-understood fragments of
predicate logic provides a wealth of information of interest to
computer scientists. As a result, a fruitful area of research in
computer science has developed with bisimulation as its core idea
(Ponse <em>et al.</em> 1995).</p>

<h2><a name="Games">14. Modal Logic and Games</a></h2>
<p>
The interaction between the theory of games and modal logic is a flourishing new area of research (van der Hoek and Pauly, 2007; van Benthem, 2011, Ch. 10, and 2014). This work has interesting applications to understanding cooperation and competition among agents as information available to them evolves. </p>

<p>
The Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma illustrates some of the concepts in game theory that can be analyzed using modal logics. Imagine two players that choose to either cooperate or cheat. If both cooperate, they both achieve a reward of 3 points, if they both cheat, they both get nothing, and if one cooperates and the other cheats, the cheater makes off with 5 points and the cooperator gets nothing. If both players are altruistic and motivated to maximize the sum of their rewards, they will both cooperate, as this is the best they can do together. However, they are both tempted to cheat to increase their own reward from 3 to 5. On the other hand, if they are rational, they may recognize that if they cheat their opponent threatens to cheat and leave them with nothing. So cooperation is the best one can do given this threat. And if each thinks the other realizes this, they may be motivated to cooperate. An extended (or iterated) version of this game gives the players multiple moves, that is, repeated opportunities to play and collect rewards. If players have information about the history of the moves and their outcomes, new concerns come into play, as success in the game depends on knowing their opponent&rsquo;s strategy, and determining (for example) when he/she can be trusted not to cheat. In multi-player versions of the game, where players are drawn in pairs from a larger pool at each move, one&rsquo;s own best strategy may well depend on whether one can recognize one&rsquo;s opponents and the strategies they have adopted. (See Grim et. al., 1998 for fascinating research on Interated Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemmas.) </p>

<p>
In games like Chess, players take turns making their moves and their
opponents can see the moves made. If we adopt the convention that the
players in a game take turns making their moves, then the Iterated
Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma is a game with missing information about the
state of play &ndash; the player with the second turn lacks
information about what the other player&rsquo;s last move was. This
illustrates the interest of games with imperfect information. </p>

<p>

The application of games to logic has a long history. One influential
application with important implications for linguistics is Game
Theoretic Semantics (GTS) (Hintikka et. al. 1983), where validity is
defined by the outcome of a game between two players one trying to
verify and the other trying to falsify a given formula. GTS has
significantly stronger resources that standard Tarski-style semantics,
as it can be used (for example) to explain how meaning evolves in a
discourse (a sequence of sentences).</p>

<p> However, the work on games and modal logic to be described here is
somewhat different. Instead of using games to analyze the semantics of
a logic, the modal logics at issue are used to analyze games. The
structure of games and their play is very rich, as it involves the
nature of the game itself (the allowed moves, and the rewards for the
outcomes), the strategies (which are sequences of moves through time),
and the flow of information available to the players as the game
progresses. Therefore, the development of modal logic for games draws
on features found in logics involving concepts like time, agency,
preference, goals, knowledge, belief, and cooperation. </p>

<p>
To provide some hint at this variety, here is a limited description of
some of the modal operators that turn up in the analysis of games and
some of the things that can be expressed with them. The basic idea in
the semantics is that a game consists of a set of players 1, 2, 3,
&hellip;, and a set of W of game states. For each player i, there is
an accessibility relation \(R_i\) understood so that \(sR_i t\) holds
for states \(s\) and \(t\) iff when the game has come to state \(s\)
player \(i\) has the option of making a move that results in
\(t\). This collection of relations defines a tree whose branches
define every possible sequence of moves in the game. The semantics
also assigns truth-values to atoms that keep track of the payoffs. So,
for example in a game like Chess, there could be an atom \(\win_i\)
such that \(v(\win_i, s)=T\) iff state s is a win for player
\(i\). Model operators \(\Box_i\) and \(\Diamond_i\) for each player i
may then be defined as follows.</p>

\[\begin{align*}
v(\Box_i A, s) &amp;=T \text{ iff for all } t \text{ in } W, \text{ if } sR_i t, \text{ then } v(A, t)=T. \\
v(\Diamond_i A, s) &amp;=T \text{ iff for some } t \text{ in } W, sR_i t \text{ and }v(A, t)=T.
\end{align*}\]

<p>
So \(\Box_i A\) \((\Diamond_i A)\) is true in s provided that sentence
\(A\) holds true in every (some) state that \(i\) can chose from state
\(s\). Given that \(\bot\) is a contradiction (so \({\sim}\bot\) is a
tautology), \(\Diamond_i {\sim}\bot\) is true at a state when it is
\(i\)&rsquo;s turn to move. For a two-player game \(\Box_1\bot\) &amp;
\(\Box_2\bot\) is true of a state that ends the game, because neither
1 nor 2 can move. \(\Box_1\Diamond_2\)win\(_2\) asserts that player 1
has a loss because whatever 1 does from the present state, 2 can win
in the following move. </p>

<p>
For a more general account of the player&rsquo;s payoffs, ordering
relations \(\leq_i\) can be defined over the states so that \(s\leq_i
t\) means that \(i\)&rsquo;s payoff for \(t\) is at least as good as
that for \(s\). Another generalization is to express facts about
sequences \(q\) of moves, by introducing operators interpreted by
relations \(sR_q t\) indicating that the sequence \(q\) starting from
s eventually arrives at \(t\). With these and related resources, it is
possible express (for example) that q is \(i\)&rsquo;s best strategy
given the present state.</p>

<p>
It is crucial to the analysis of games to have a way to express the
information available to the players. One way to accomplish this is to
borrow ideas from epistemic logic. Here we may introduce an
accessibility relation \({\sim}_i\) for each player such that
\(s{\sim}_i t\) holds iff \(i\) cannot distinguish between states
\(s\) and \(t\). Then knowledge operators \(\rK_i\) for the players
can be defined so that \(\rK_i A\) says at \(s\) that \(A\) holds in
all worlds that \(i\) can distinguish from \(s\); that is, despite
\(i\)&rsquo;s ignorance about the state of play, he/she can still be
confident that \(A\). \(\rK\) operators may be used to say that player
1 is in a position to resign, for he knows that 2 sees she has a win:
\(\rK_1 \rK_2\Box_1\Diamond_2\win_2\).</p>

<p>
Since player&rsquo;s information varies as the game progresses, it is
useful to think of moves of the game as indexed by times, and to
introduce operators \(O\) and \(U\) from tense logic for
&lsquo;next&rsquo; and &lsquo;until&rsquo;. Then \(K_i OA
\rightarrow OK_i A\) expresses that player \(i\) has &ldquo;perfect
recall&rdquo;, that is, that when \(i\) knows that \(A\) happens next, then
at the next moment \(i\) has not forgotten that \(A\) has
happened. This illustrates how modal logics for games can reflect
cognitive idealizations, and a player&rsquo;s success (or failure) at
living up to them.</p>

<p>
The technical side of the modal logics for games is challenging. The
project of identifying systems of rules that are sound and complete
for a language containing a large collection of operators may be
guided by past research, but the interactions between the variety of
accessibility relations leads to new concerns. Furthermore, the
computational complexity of various systems and their fragments is a
large landscape largely unexplored.</p>

<p>
Game theoretic concepts can be applied in a surprising variety of ways
&ndash; from checking an argument for validity to succeeding in the
political arena. So there are strong motivations for formulating
logics that can handle games. What is striking about this research is
the power one obtains by weaving together logics of time, agency,
knowledge, belief, and preference in a unified setting. The lessons
learned from that integration have value well beyond what they
contribute to understanding games.</p>

<h2><a name="QuaModLog">15. Quantifiers in Modal Logic</a></h2>

<p>

It would seem to be a simple matter to outfit a modal logic with the
quantifiers \(\forall\) (all) and \(\exists\) (some). One would simply
add the standard (or classical) rules for quantifiers to the
principles of whichever propositional modal logic one
chooses. However, adding quantifiers to modal logic involves a number
of difficulties. Some of these are philosophical. For example, Quine
(1953) has famously argued that quantifying into modal contexts is
simply incoherent, a view that has spawned a gigantic
literature. Quine&rsquo;s complaints do not carry the weight they once
did. See Barcan (1990) for a good summary, and note Kripke&rsquo;s
(2017) (written in the 60&rsquo;s for a class with Quine) which
provides a strong formal argument that there can be nothing wrong with
&ldquo;quantifying in&rdquo;.</p>

<p> 
A second kind of complication is technical. There is a wide variety in
the choices one can make in the semantics for quantified modal logic,
and the proof that a system of rules is correct for a given choice can
be difficult. The work of Corsi (2002) and Garson (2005) goes some way
towards bringing unity to this terrain, and Johannesson (2018)
introduces constraints that help reduce the number of options;
nevertheless the situation still remains challenging.</p>

<p>

Another complication is that some logicians believe that modality
requires abandoning classical quantifier rules in favor of the weaker
rules of free logic (Garson 2001). The main points of disagreement
concerning the quantifier rules can be traced back to decisions about
how to handle the domain of quantification. The simplest alternative,
the fixed-domain (sometimes called the possibilist) approach, assumes
a single domain of quantification that contains all the possible
objects. On the other hand, the world-relative (or actualist)
interpretation, assumes that the domain of quantification changes from
world to world, and contains only the objects that actually exist in a
given world.</p>

<p>

The fixed-domain approach requires no major adjustments to the
classical machinery for the quantifiers. Modal logics that are
adequate for fixed domain semantics can usually be axiomatized by
adding principles of a propositional modal logic to classical
quantifier rules together with the Barcan Formula
\((BF)\) (Barcan 1946). (For an account of some
interesting exceptions see Cresswell (1995)).</p>

\[\tag{\(BF\)}
 \forall x\Box A\rightarrow \Box \forall  xA.
\]

<p>

The fixed-domain interpretation has advantages of simplicity and
familiarity, but it does not provide a direct account of the semantics
of certain quantifier expressions of natural language. We do not think
that &lsquo;Some man exists who signed the Declaration of
Independence&rsquo; is true, at least not if we read
&lsquo;exists&rsquo; in the present tense. Nevertheless, this sentence
was true in 1777, which shows that the domain for the natural language
expression &lsquo;some man exists who&rsquo; changes to reflect which
men exist at different times. A related problem is that on the
fixed-domain interpretation, the sentence \(\forall y\Box \exists
x(x=y)\) is valid. Assuming that \(\exists x(x=y)\) is read: \(y\)
exists, \(\forall y\Box \exists x(x=y)\) says that everything exists
necessarily. However, it seems a fundamental feature of common ideas
about modality that the existence of many things is contingent, and
that different objects exist in different possible worlds. </p>

<p>

The defender of the fixed-domain interpretation may respond to these
objections by insisting that on his (her) reading of the quantifiers,
the domain of quantification contains <em>all</em> possible objects,
not just the objects that happen to exist at a given world. So the
theorem \(\forall y\Box \exists x(x=y)\) makes the innocuous claim
that every <em>possible</em> object is necessarily found in the domain
of all possible objects. Furthermore, those quantifier expressions of
natural language whose domain is world (or time) dependent can be
expressed using the fixed-domain quantifier \(\exists x\) and a
predicate letter \(E\) with the reading &lsquo;actually
exists&rsquo;. For example, instead of translating &lsquo;Some \(M\)an
exists who \(S\)igned the Declaration of Independence&rsquo; by</p>

\[
 \exists x(Mx \amp Sx),
\]

<p>

the defender of fixed domains may write: </p>

\[
 \exists x(Ex \amp Mx \amp Sx),
\]

<p>

thus ensuring the translation is counted false at the present time.
Cresswell (1991) makes the interesting observation that world-relative
quantification has limited expressive power relative to fixed-domain
quantification. World-relative quantification can be defined with
fixed domain quantifiers and \(E\), but there is no way to fully
express fixed-domain quantifiers with world-relative ones. Although
this argues in favor of the classical approach to quantified modal
logic, the translation tactic also amounts to something of a
concession in favor of free logic, for the world-relative quantifiers
so defined obey exactly the free logic rules. </p>

<p>

A problem with the translation strategy used by defenders of fixed
domain quantification is that rendering the English into logic is less
direct, since \(E\) must be added to all translations of all
sentences whose quantifier expressions have domains that are context
dependent. A more serious objection to fixed-domain quantification is
that it strips the quantifier of a role which Quine recommended for
it, namely to record robust ontological commitment. On this view, the
domain of \(\exists x\) must contain only entities that are
ontologically respectable, and possible objects are too abstract to
qualify. Actualists of this stripe will want to develop the logic of a
quantifier \(\exists x\) which reflects commitment to what is
actual in a given world rather than to what is merely possible.</p>

<p>

However, some work on
 <a href="../actualism/index.html">actualism</a> (Menzel, 1990) 
tends to undermine this objection. For example, Linsky and Zalta
(1994) and Williamson, (2013) argue that the fixed-domain quantifier
can be given an interpretation that is perfectly acceptable to
actualists. Pavone (2018) even contends that on the haecceitist
interpretation, which quantifies over individual essences, fixed
domains are required. Actualists who employ possible worlds
semantics routinely quantify over possible worlds in their semantical
theory of language. So it would seem that possible worlds are actual
by these actualist&rsquo;s lights. By populating the domain with
abstract entities no more objectionable than possible worlds,
actualists may vindicate the Barcan Formula and classical
principles. </p>

<p>
Note however, that some actualists may respond that they need not be
committed to the actuality of possible worlds so long as it is
understood that quantifiers used in their theory of language lack
strong ontological import. Furthermore, Hayaki (2006) argues that
quantifying over abstract entities is actually incompatible with any
serious form of actualism. In any case, it is open to actualists (and
non actualists as well) to investigate the logic of quantifiers with
more robust domains, for example domains excluding possible worlds and
other such abstract entities, and containing only the spatio-temporal
particulars found in a given world. For quantifiers of this kind, a
world-relative domains are appropriate.</p>

<p>

Such considerations motivate interest in systems that acknowledge the
context dependence of quantification by introducing world-relative
domains. Here each possible world has its own domain of quantification
(the set of objects that actually exist in that world), and the
domains vary from one world to the next. When this decision is made, a
difficulty arises for classical quantification theory. Notice that the
sentence \(\exists x(x=t)\) is a theorem of classical logic, and so
\(\Box \exists x(x=t)\) is a theorem of \(\bK\) by the Necessitation
Rule. Let the term \(t\) stand for Saul Kripke. Then this theorem says
that it is necessary that Saul Kripke exists, so that he is in the
domain of every possible world. The whole motivation for the
world-relative approach was to reflect the idea that objects in one
world may fail to exist in another. If standard quantifier rulers are
used, however, every term \(t\) must refer to something that exists in
all the possible worlds. This seems incompatible with our ordinary
practice of using terms to refer to things that only exist
contingently.</p>

<p>

One response to this difficulty is simply to eliminate terms. Kripke
(1963) gives an example of a system that uses the world-relative
interpretation and preserves the classical rules. However, the costs
are severe. First, his language is artificially impoverished, and
second, the rules for the propositional modal logic must be
weakened.</p>

<p>

Presuming that we would like a language that includes terms, and that
classical rules are to be added to standard systems of propositional
modal logic, a new problem arises. In such a system, it is possible to
prove \((CBF)\), the converse of the Barcan
Formula.</p>

\[\tag{\(CBF\)}
 \Box \forall xA\rightarrow \forall x\Box A.
\]

<p>

This fact has serious consequences for the system&rsquo;s
semantics. It is not difficult to show that every world-relative model
of \((CBF)\) must meet condition \((ND)\) (for &lsquo;nested
domains&rsquo;). </p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">
<li><span class="tag">\((ND)\)
</span>
    <span class="sen">
If \(wRv\) then the domain of \(w\) is a subset of the domain of \(v\).
</span></li>
</ul>


<p>

However \((ND)\) conflicts with the point of introducing
world-relative domains. The whole idea was that existence of objects
is contingent so that there are accessible possible worlds where one
of the things in our world fails to exist. </p>

<p>

A straightforward solution to these problems is to abandon classical
rules for the quantifiers and to adopt rules for free logic
\((\mathbf{FL})\) instead. The rules of \(\mathbf{FL}\) are the same
as the classical rules, except that inferences from \(\forall xRx\)
(everything is real) to \(Rp\) (Pegasus is real) are blocked. This is
done by introducing a predicate &lsquo;\(E\)&rsquo; (for
&lsquo;actually exists&rsquo;) and modifying the rule of universal
instantiation. From \(\forall xRx\) one is allowed to obtain \(Rp\)
only if one also has obtained \(Ep\). Assuming that the universal
quantifier \(\forall x\) is primitive, and the existential quantifier
\(\exists x\) is defined by \(\exists xA =_{df} {\sim}\forall
x{\sim}A\), then \(\mathbf{FL}\) may be constructed by adding the
following two principles to the rules of propositional logic</p>

<p class="indent">
Universal Generalization.<br />
If \(B\rightarrow(Ey\rightarrow A(y))\) is a theorem, so is
\(B\rightarrow \forall xA(x)\).</p>

<p class="indent">
Universal Instantiation.<br />
\(\forall xA(x)\rightarrow(En\rightarrow A(n))\)
</p>

<p>

(Here it is assumed that \(A(x)\) is any well-formed formula of
predicate logic, and that \(A(y)\) and \(A(n)\) result from replacing
\(y\) and \(n\) properly for each occurrence of \(x\) in \(A(x)\).)
Note that the instantiation axiom is restricted by mention of \(En\)
in the antecedent. The rule of Universial Generalization is modified
in the same way. In \(\mathbf{FL}\), proofs of formulas like \(\exists
x\Box(x=t)\), \(\forall y\Box \exists x(x=y)\), \((CBF)\), and
\((BF)\), which seem incompatible with the world-relative
interpretation, are blocked. </p>

<p>

One philosophical objection to \(\mathbf{FL}\) is that \(E\)
appears to be an existence predicate, and many would argue that
existence is not a legitimate property like being green or weighing
more than four pounds. So philosophers who reject the idea that
existence is a predicate may object to \(\mathbf{FL}\). However in
most (but not all) quantified modal logics that include identity \((=)\)
these worries may be skirted by defining \(E\) as follows.</p>

\[
 Et =_{df} \exists x(x=t).
\]

<p>

The most general way to formulate quantified modal logic is to create
\(\mathbf{FS}\) by adding the rules of \(\mathbf{FL}\) to a
given propositional modal logic \(\mathbf{S}\). In situations
where classical quantification is desired, one may simply add
\(Et\) as an axiom to \(\mathbf{FS}\), so that the
classical principles become derivable rules. Adequacy results for such
systems can be obtained for most choices of the modal logic
\(\mathbf{S}\), but there are exceptions. </p>

<p>

A final complication in the semantics for quantified modal logic is
worth mentioning. It arises when non-rigid expressions such as
&lsquo;the inventor of bifocals&rsquo; are introduced to the language.
A term is non-rigid when it picks out different objects in different
possible worlds. The semantical value of such a term can be given by
what Carnap (1947) called an individual concept, a function that picks
out the denotation of the term for each possible world. One approach
to dealing with non-rigid terms is to employ Russell&rsquo;s theory of
descriptions. However, in a language that treats non rigid expressions
as genuine terms, it turns out that neither the classical nor the free
logic rules for the quantifiers are acceptable. (The problem can not
be resolved by weakening the rule of substitution for identity.) A
solution to this problem is to employ a more general treatment of the
quantifiers, where the domain of quantification contains individual
concepts rather than objects. This more general interpretation
provides a better match between the treatment of terms and the
treatment of quantifiers and results in systems that are adequate for
classical or free logic rules (depending on whether the fixed domains
or world-relative domains are chosen). It also provides a language
with strong and much needed expressive powers (Bressan, 1973, Belnap
and M&uuml;ller, 2013a, 2013b). </p>

 See Moss 2019 for an argument for this view. And see Rinard 2017b for
an argument against any view according to which the whole truth of our
doxastic states can be captured by any function (credal or otherwise)
that takes precise values of any kind, whether points or intervals.

 Williamson 2002 and Sutton 2007 both take it to be a constitutive
norm of belief that it is supposed to be knowledge. Wedgwood 2002 and
Whiting 2013 both take it to be a constitutive norm of belief that it
is supposed to be true. Shah 2003 argues that it is a <em>conceptual
truth</em> that belief is supposed to be true, but he regards this
conceptual truth as not <em>metaphysically constitutive</em> of the
state of belief. </p>

 Some writers, like Wedgwood 2017, regard epistemic permissibility as
a matter of <em>sufficient</em> epistemic value. Others, like Alston
1988 and Plantinga 1993, think that epistemic evaluation is not a form
of <em>deontic</em> evaluation at all, and so the very idea of
&ldquo;permissibility&rdquo; does not have clear application in
epistemology. For an extended treatment of sub-optimality in
epistemology, see Staffel 2019.</p>

 James 1896 is typically regarded as the source of this view, though
it is popular today as well: see BonJour 1985, Brogard 2009, Greco
1993, Kornblith 1983, and many others.</p>

 See Rinard (2017a, 2019b) for a defense of the view that it is all
and only practical reasons that make beliefs optimal and permissible.
See Lycan 1988 for a defense of the view that beliefs are permissible
only in so far as they are formed by processes that are evolutionarily
adaptive.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>  Such an attempt to reduce or

 For a book-length discussion of epistemic luck and the conceptual
tools employed to capture the way knowledge and epistemic luck are
incompatible, see Pritchard 2005. For an ingenious argument that what
counts as epistemic luck cannot be fixed independently of how the
epistemic agent conceives of her reasons for belief, see Lando 2016.
For an argument that true belief alone suffices for knowledge, see
Sartwell 1992 and Hetherington 2001.</p>

 They are referred to as Gettier cases because, in his 1963 paper
&ldquo;Is Justified True belief Knowledge&rdquo;, Edmund Gettier
described two cases that are widely taken to decisively refute the
analyses of knowledge as justified true belief. For an excellent
discussion of the Gettier problem, see the appendix in Pollock
1986.</p>

 The barn-facades case first appears in Goldman 1976, but Goldman
credits it to Carl Ginet. See Gendler and Hawthorne 2005 for some

 See Unger 1975 and Hyman 1999 for defenses of this view; see Fantl
and McGrath 2009 and also Comesa&ntilde;a and McGrath 2016 for
dissent: according to the dissenting view of the latter, the reasons
for which we do things are never facts, but rather propositions, and
it is only when our justification for believing these propositions
satisfies the justification condition for knowledge that these
propositions can be the reasons for which we think or do
something.</p>

 See Sutton 2007 for an argument to the effect that a belief is
justified if and only if it is knowledgeably held. Although Littlejohn
2012 argues that justified beliefs must be true, only Sutton argues
that all justified beliefs must be knowledgeably held.</p>

 This definition employs the notion of obligation. Alternative
definitions can be given employing other members of the family of
deontological terms: requirement, duty, permission, or prohibition.
Still further definitions are possible when we widen the range of
relevant concepts, employing notions such as responsibility, being in
the clear, and blameworthiness.</p>

 I say &ldquo;may be&rdquo; something else, since some philosophers
think that the moral or prudential point of view may be ultimately all
that is relevant even when epistemically assessing beliefs. See, for

 Alston writes: &ldquo;I agree that &lsquo;justification&rsquo; is the
wrong word for a non-deontological concept, but we seem to be stuck
with it in contemporary theory of knowledge&rdquo; (1989: 7f.).</p>

 A belief can be very likely to be true in a way that is completely
irrelevant to the beliefs being, or not being, an instance of
knowledge. In that case, it wouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;sufficiently
likely to be true&rdquo; in a way that is at all relevant to any
question of justification. Suppose Jack believes Meyer will win the
election. Suppose further Jack&rsquo;s belief originates solely in
wishful thinking. Finally, suppose Meyer&rsquo;s winning the election
is objectively probable because it&rsquo;s a fact that 80% of those
who will vote will vote in his favor. So the <i>p</i> that Jack believes is
very likely to be true. As a result, it&rsquo;s very likely that
Jack&rsquo;s belief is true. But, since Jack&rsquo;s belief is the
result of wishful thinking, it wouldn&rsquo;t be justified or an
instance of knowledge. What we need is likelihood of truth that arises
not by virtue of what the subject believes (the belief&rsquo;s
content), but rather by virtue of the way in which the subject holds,
or comes to hold, the belief. But then we must find, in a systematic
and principled way, a way of specifying the relevant ways of holding,
or coming to hold, a belief. This endeavor raises what has been called
the &ldquo;generality problem&rdquo;. See Conee and Feldman 1998
[2004].</p>

 The characterization of internalism by appeal to the thought that the
brain in a vat is as justified as the normal agent comes from Lehrer
and Cohen 1983. For defenses of internalism, see BonJour 1985,

 The word &ldquo;always&rdquo; is important here because externalists
need not, and indeed should not, assert that justification, understood
externalistically in terms of reliability, is <em>never</em>
recognizable on reflection. For example, suppose you hear, and thus
come to believe, that there is a dog barking outside. Arguably, in a
typical case like this, reflection will tell you that your belief has
a reliable origin. If it does, then you can, on this occasion,
recognize on reflection that your belief is justified even if we
understand justification in terms of reliability.</p>

 Access internalism has been defended by Roderick Chisholm, who can
reasonably be viewed as the chief advocate of internalist, traditional
epistemology in the second half of the twentieth century. In his
<em>Theory of Knowledge</em> ([1966, second edition] 1977: 17),
Chisholm writes: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We presuppose &hellip; that the things we know are justified for us in
the following sense: we can know what it is, <em>on any occasion</em>,
that constitutes our grounds, or reason, or evidence for thinking that
we know. (Emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="note-33">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-33">33.</a>
 Arguably, there are non-evidentialist versions of internalism. For
example, consider the view that the coherence of one&rsquo;s belief
system is a J-factor. According to this view, the justificational
status of one&rsquo;s beliefs is determined by more than just
one&rsquo;s evidence. If a belief system&rsquo;s coherence is
something suitably internal, such a non-evidentialist view would count
as internalist. Among externalist theories, reliabilism is not the
only candidate either. For example, Plantinga&rsquo;s proper
functionalism, Nozick&rsquo;s tracking theory, and Dretske&rsquo;s
conclusive reasons theory all qualify as externalist, but none of them
are in any straightforward sense a version of reliabilism. See
Plantinga 1993b; Nozick 1981; and Dretske 1971 and 1981.</p>

 At first sight, this might seem a strange claim. For example, when
upon being immersed in a liquid a strip of litmus paper turns red,
that could be viewed as being evidence for the liquid&rsquo;s being an
acid solution. Surely, it could be argued, that the paper&rsquo;s
color change is evidence of acidity is not the sort of thing that can
be found out solely on reflection. However, if you don&rsquo;t know
that litmus paper when being immersed in an acid solution turns red,
your observation of the paper&rsquo;s color change will not be any
evidence for you at all for thinking that the liquid in question is an
acid solution. So if we are careful about describing what the evidence
in this case really is, we would have to say that it consists of the
following two items:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li> The general principle that, when immersed in an acid solution,
litmus paper turns red.</li>

<li> The observation that the strip of litmus paper immersed in the
liquid turned red.</li>
</ol>

<p>
So, what&rsquo;s evidence for</p>

<ol type="1" start="3">

<li>The liquid is an acid solution.</li>

is not (2) by itself but the conjunction of (1) and (2). When some
internalists argue that evidential connections are recognizable on
reflection, they always have in mind principles that identify the
relevant evidence in its completeness. So, regarding the present
example, advocates of Necessity might claim that what&rsquo;s
recognizable on reflection is the proposition that the conjunction of
(1) and (2) is evidence for (3). That claim can certainly be disputed,
but it is not in any obvious way lacking in plausibility.</p>

 Chisholm held that there are necessarily true and <em>a priori</em>
recognizable principles of evidence, and that these principles are
internal &ldquo;in that the proper use of them at any time will enable
us to ascertain the epistemic status of our own beliefs at that
time&rdquo;. Chisholm [1966, third edition] 1989: 62. For
Chisholm&rsquo;s view regarding the <em>a priori</em> status of these
principles, see p. 72. For a critical discussion of classical
internalism, Chisholmian internalism, and post-Chisholmian
internalism, see Plantinga 1993.</p>

 Does the conjunction of evidentialism with Luminosity and Necessity
entail access internalism? To settle this issue, we would have to
address the question of conjunction closure, viz., whether being able
to recognize on reflection what evidence one has, and being able to
recognize on reflection what is supported by any particular body of
evidence, entails being able to recognize on reflection what is
supported by one&rsquo;s own body of evidence.</p>

 A conception of basicality along this lines is employed in Huemer
2001 and Pryor 2000 &amp; 2005 [2013]. It is also at work in Van Cleve
in Elgin and Van Cleve 2005 [2013]. According to Huemer&rsquo;s view,
which he labels <em>phenomenal conservatism</em>: a belief that
<i>p</i> can be justified solely by a seeming that <i>p</i>. In his
2000, Pryor defends a similar view, which he calls <em>dogmatism</em>:
a perceptual belief that <i>p</i> can be justified solely by a perceptual
experience that <i>p</i>. Van Cleve argues in support of a
foundationalist position characterized by the claim that memory
beliefs can be justified solely by ostensible memories. So each of
them holds that a belief can be justified by an experiential ground
alone, that is, without the subject&rsquo;s having any further
justification for believing something in addition to the belief in
question. For two excellent collections of essays discussing this type
of foundationalism, see Tucker 2013, and Dodd and Zardini 2014. </p>

 One problem that arises for this approach is the following: Many
epistemologists share the intuition that, if an evil demon deceives
you and your perceptual experiences are therefore completely
misleading you, they are nevertheless a source of justification for
you because, from your own, internal point of view, such deception is
not detectable. The externalist answer we just considered, however,
implies that they would not be a source of justification.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-45">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-45">45.</a>
 It follows from this internalist answer that your perceptual
experiences are a source of justification for you even if they are
systematically unreliable concerning the truth of their contents.</p>

 Malmgren 2018 argues that, if the distinction between basic and
nonbasic belief is construed as both exclusive and exhaustive, then it
will be radically indeterminate, even given the totality of
psychological facts, which beliefs are basic and which are nonbasic.

 Thus Richard Fumerton says the following, in the context of employing
circular reasoning for the purpose of rebutting skepticism: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
You cannot use perception to justify the reliability of perception!
You cannot use memory to justify the reliability of memory! You cannot
use induction to justify the reliability of induction! Such attempts
to respond to the skeptic&rsquo;s concerns involve blatant, indeed
pathetic, circularity. (1995: 177); </p>

involved in arguing for the reliability of perception.</p>

 The &ldquo;foundherentism&rdquo; defended in Haack 1993 is an example
of such dependence coherentism, as is Conee 1988 and McCain 2014. For
recent literature defending various versions of coherentism, see

 There is a further option: the regress ends in a belief that is not
justified. It is difficult to see, though, how a belief that is not
justified could possibly justify any other beliefs.</p>

 We should distinguish between the regress problem and various regress
arguments. The regress problem is that of explaining how justification
is possible given that it generates a seemingly infinite regress of
justification. A regress argument is meant to support a particular
solution to the regress problem on the basis of rejecting the
competing solutions. Thus the regress argument for foundationalism
rejects coherentism and infinitism as viable options. Klein, however,
rejects both foundationalism and coherentism to argue for infinitism.
(See Klein 1999 and Klein in Klein &amp; Ginet 2005 [2013]; see Ginet
in Klein &amp; Ginet 2005 [2013] for a response to Klein&rsquo;s
defense of infinitism.) Likewise, coherentists could argue that
neither foundationalism nor infinitism is a viable option.</p>

 Doxastic coherentists might reply that, when the chameleon changes
its color to purple, Kim forms the belief that the chameleon looks
purple to her. Because of this belief, she would not be justified in
still believing that the chameleon is blue. Therefore, doxastic
coherentism can explain after all why Kim&rsquo;s belief (the
chameleon is blue) is unjustified after the chameleon changed its
color to purple. The problem with this reply is that foundationalists
are free to describe the example in whatever way they want (as long as
it remains conceivable). And obviously, they would want to describe it
by stipulating that Kim does not form any beliefs about how the
chameleon appears to her. In response to that, doxastic coherentists
could say that Kim&rsquo;s failing to form beliefs about how the
chameleon appears to her is inconceivable. That claim, however, does
not recommend itself as a plausible one.</p>

 It could be argued that, by ascribing propositional content to
perceptual experiences, we thereby turn them into mental states that
are sufficiently belief-like to be like beliefs in this regard: they
can justify only if they are justified themselves. This claim is more
easily made than defended. If the hat looks blue to you, then your
perceptual experience presents a certain propositional content to you,
namely that the hat is blue. Nevertheless, even though it has that
content, it is distinct from the belief that the hat is blue. Why?
Obviously, because it&rsquo;s possible that the hat looks blue to you
while you fail to believe, or while you even disbelieve, that the hat
is blue. You might know independently, for example, that the hat is
white and looks blue to you only because you are wearing blue tinted
glasses. In that case, the hat would look blue to you without your
believing that it looks blue to you. It is not easy to see, therefore,
in which sense the possession of propositional content should make
perceptual experiences in any significant sense
&ldquo;belief-like&rdquo;.</p>

 Schellenberg 2013 argues that some perceptual experiences&mdash;the
factive ones&mdash;provide knowledge of external objects, whereas
others&mdash;mere appearances&mdash;provide weaker justification for
those same beliefs. Siegel 2017 agrees that different perceptual
experiences can provide different levels of warrant, or justification,
but for Siegel, these difference perceptual experiences can themselves
be more or less justified.</p>

 There is no escape from Gettier problems even in the area of <em>a
priori</em> justification. What would be an example of a true belief
that is justified <em>a priori</em> but is nevertheless not an
instance of knowledge? Suppose Carl is a logician. He is trying to
prove that <i>p</i> is a necessary truth, where <i>p</i> is a rather complicated
proposition. He runs through a long and complex proof and concludes
that <i>p</i> is indeed necessarily true. Unfortunately, even though Carl is
right, he made a small and subtle mistake so difficult to spot that it
leaves Carl&rsquo;s justification intact. It seems we should judge
that, because of his mistake, that Carl does not know that <i>p</i> is a
necessary truth. So Carl&rsquo;s belief that <i>p</i> is a necessary truth is
a justified true belief that fails to be knowledge.</p>

 For G. E. Moore&rsquo;s response to skepticism, see Moore 1959b,c. An
objection to the Moorean response that&rsquo;s not discussed here is
that the response is question begging. It&rsquo;s, however, an open
question whether it really is. What&rsquo;s needed to make that charge
stick is a precise account of when an argument begs the question.
Until such an account is provided, the charge of question begging is
rather ad hoc. But even if Counter-BIV is not question begging, we may
still wonder whether we could come to know we are not BIVs on the
basis of employing this argument. The issue here is that of epistemic
priority. It might be that I must know in the first place that
I&rsquo;m not a BIV if I am to know that I have hands. If that&rsquo;s
right, one couldn&rsquo;t acquire knowledge of not being a BIV by
virtue of employing Counter BIV. For discussion on the Moorean
response, see Pritchard 2004, Pryor 2004 and Sosa 1999b.</p>

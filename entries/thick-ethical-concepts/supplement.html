<h3 id="FurtQuesAbouSignThicConc">1. Further Questions about the Significance of Thick Concepts</h3>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#DoThicConcHaveDistSign">Section 2</a>
 of the main text focuses on three strands of argument concerning the
broader philosophical significance of thick concepts. Beyond those
arguments, there are further issues in both metaethics and normative
ethics for which thick terms and concepts might be thought
significant.</p>

<p>
In metaethics, thick concepts might have implications for a range of
metaphysical questions about ethics. Some of these concern truth and
objectivity. If there couldn&rsquo;t be a wholly non-evaluative
expression that is necessarily coextensive with a thick term but
utterances involving thick terms are sometimes true, does this mean
that there are some irreducible evaluative facts? And even if we think
that truth might instead be a minimal property, so that the truth of a
claim doesn&rsquo;t entail that there is a corresponding fact in any
ontologically robust sense, we might still wonder whether utterances
involving thick terms could be objectively true, in the sense of
holding independently of even our best stances towards them. But as
noted at the end of
 <a href="index-2.html#ReflKnowPrio">section 2.3</a>
 in the main text, it is controversial whether we can draw any
significant conclusions about the nature of evaluative truths and
their objectivity specifically from reflection on thick terms and
concepts. Be that as it may, if thick concepts pick out robust
properties with inseparable evaluative and non-evaluative aspects,
then the supervenience claim that there can be no evaluative
difference without a non-evaluative difference might be problematic: a
difference in properties ascribed by thick concepts might not be
traceable to a difference in non-evaluative properties (Dancy 1995:
278; Roberts 2018b). In the same event, the very widely accepted claim
that the normative depends on the non-normative might be challenged;
for in that case bracketing normative concepts might not leave us
enough to adequately represent what it is that normative
considerations are supposed to hold in virtue of (Roberts 2017). It
would then also seem to be easier to defend the claim that evaluative
properties enter in their own right into causal explanations of
non-evaluative goings-on. Claims such as &ldquo;Honesty engenders
trust&rdquo; and &ldquo;People are starving because of the selfishness
of others&rdquo; are commonplace, and seem to advance causal
explanations. Conversely, the prospects for such &ldquo;moral
explanations&rdquo; seem dimmer if the properties picked out by thick
terms aren&rsquo;t genuinely evaluative (Cline 2015).</p>

<p>
Thick concepts have received less attention in normative ethics than
in metaethics. Focus on good and bad, right and wrong, obligation and
duty has been dominant in the consequentialist, deontological, and
contractualist traditions in Western moral philosophy. But insofar as
neglecting thick concepts leads to a simplistic or distorted picture
of our first-order ethical thought, attention to them is required even
in normative ethics (Anscombe 1958; Williams 1985). Concepts such as
<span class="sc">right</span> and <span class="sc">obligatory</span>
are so general and abstract that thicker terms may be required to give
them more determinate content and enable us to figure out how to act.
And since virtue and vice concepts are prominent among paradigmatic
thick concepts, it may be no accident that urging greater attention to
thick concepts tends to go with sympathy for virtue ethics. Rosalind
Hursthouse, for example, argues that an action is right if and only if
it is what a virtuous agent would characteristically do in the
circumstances, where a virtuous agent is one who has and exercises the
virtues (Hursthouse 1996: 20&ndash;2). To help the non-virtuous who
may have little direct idea of what the virtuous person would do in
the circumstances, helpful guidance for right action can be specified
more concretely in terms of &ldquo;virtue rules&rdquo; which virtuous
action will follow: &ldquo;Do what is honest/charitable/etc/&rdquo;;
&ldquo;Do not do what is
selfish/cruel/inconsiderate/disloyal/etc.&rdquo; (Hursthouse 1996:
26&ndash;7; cf. Annas 2016). Hursthouse claims that even toddlers can
know what it takes to follow rules such as &ldquo;Be kind to your
brother&rdquo;, and explicitly counts virtue terms as thick (1996: 27;
see also Annas 2016). Claims like these seem again to require
particular commitments regarding the nature of thick concepts. They
don&rsquo;t sit well with Thin Centralism; if thin concepts were
conceptually and explanatorily prior to the thick, then the practical
import rules couched in thick terms (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do what is
disloyal&rdquo;; &ldquo;Do what is honest&rdquo;) would seem to derive
from that of <span class="sc">bad</span> or <span class="sc">wrong</span>.
And if Separability were true, the
action-guiding character of thick concepts would merely combine those
of thin ethical concepts and non-evaluative concepts; thus a case for
a genuinely distinctive normative role of thick concepts seems easiest
to mount under Inseparability. Similar commitments may accrue to other
proposals on the normative role of thick concepts, such as the idea
that ethics requires traditions that are stable enough to deliver
thick specifications of virtues and exemplars (MacIntyre 1984).</p>

<h3 id="ThreFurtInseProp">2. Three Further Inseparabilist Proposals</h3>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#InseView">Section 3.2</a>
 of the main text covers only a simple proposal concerning what thick
concepts might have in common with thin evaluative concepts according
to Inseparabilists. At least three other Inseparabilist options have
been noted. The first is due to Edward Harcourt and Alan Thomas. The
property picked out by the concept <span class="sc">red</span> is a
determinate of the determinable property picked out by the concept
<span class="sc">colored</span>. Harcourt and Thomas suggest that the
relation between a thick concept such as <span class="sc">brutal</span>
and the thin concept <span class="sc">pro
tanto bad</span> is analogous to the relation between <span class="sc">red</span>
and <span class="sc">colored</span> (2013:
24&ndash;7). We cannot analyze <span class="sc">red</span> as a
combination of being colored plus some feature other than redness, so
the analogous proposal about thick concepts won&rsquo;t collapse to
Separability. It can explain how thick concepts are descriptive: being
brutal is a specific way of being bad in the same way as being red is
a specific way of being colored; in each case the determinate has more
descriptive content than its determinable. The view can also explain
how thick concepts get to be evaluative: since being brutal is a way
of being <em>pro tanto</em> bad, <span class="sc">brutal</span> can
derive its evaluative import (such as reasons to avoid and disapprove
of brutal actions) from the evaluative import of <span class="sc">pro
tanto bad</span>. This view needn&rsquo;t commit Inseparabilists to
Thin Centralism, since it isn&rsquo;t clear that we can grasp <span class="sc">colored</span>
without grasping at least some of its
determinates; Thick Centralism and No Priority remain on the table. It
is, however, unclear whether the thick-thin relation is sufficiently
analogous to the determinate-determinable relation to be explained as
an instance of it. The determinates of a determinable exclude each
other: no colored thing can be both red and yellow (all over). But a
<em>pro tanto</em> bad action can be both selfish and brutal. No color
property is a determinate of both <span class="sc">colored</span> and
some other determinable that isn&rsquo;t a color property; but how do
we settle whether cruel is a determinate of <span class="sc">wrong</span>
or <span class="sc">bad</span>? Finally, many
writers believe that thick concepts can vary in their evaluative
valence across contexts (Blackburn 1992; Dancy 1995; V&auml;yrynen
2011; Kyle 2013a). Rudeness, for instance, isn&rsquo;t always bad, but
may be evaluatively neutral or even called for, and it may be morally
misguided but not necessarily confused to think that international
terrorism merits focused brutality. But the instantiation of a
determinate property necessitates the determinable property. Red
things cannot but be colored. These features of the thick-thin
relation seem to mark enough differences with the
determinate-determinable relation to question Harcourt and
Thomas&rsquo;s analogy (see also Cannon 2020).</p>

<p>
A second proposal is due to Debbie Roberts. On her view, a concept is
evaluative when and because it ascribes an evaluative property (other
writers reverse the explanation: a property is evaluative when and
because it is ascribed by an evaluative concept; see Eklund 2013). For
a concept to ascribe a property <i>P</i> is for the real definition of
<i>P</i> to be given by the content of that concept. And a property
<i>P</i> is evaluative if (i) <i>P</i> is intrinsically linked to
human concerns and purposes; (ii) there are various lower-level
properties, each of which can make it the case that <i>P</i> is
instantiated but none of which is necessary for <i>P</i> to be
instantiated; and (iii) these lower-level properties don&rsquo;t
necessitate the instantiation of <i>P</i>, rather some further
features must also obtain. Roberts holds that both thick and thin
concepts ascribe properties that satisfy (i)&ndash;(iii) (Roberts
2013b: 91&ndash;5). However, some non-evaluative properties seem to
satisfy (i)&ndash;(iii) as well. Evolutionary fitness
(organisms&rsquo; capacity to survive and reproduce in their
environment) is intrinsically linked to human concerns and purposes,
it can be instantiated by many different lower-level properties
depending on what the organism&rsquo;s environment happens to be, but
its instantiation isn&rsquo;t necessitated by these lower-level
properties (all sorts of factors can interfere with capacities for
survival and reproduction). But evolutionary fitness isn&rsquo;t an
evaluative property in the relevant sense. (The reply that (i) should
be strengthened to &ldquo;intrinsically linked to
<em>distinctively</em> human concerns and purposes&rdquo; would rule
out too much.)</p>

<p>
A third option is to take the idea that thick concepts are irreducibly
thick to mean that they are evaluative &ldquo;in their own
right&rdquo;. Instead of having evaluative and descriptive aspects,
the meanings of thick terms and concepts have only a single element,
and that element is both evaluative and descriptive. Thinking that an
action is brutal is one thing, thinking that it is thereby bad in a
certain way is another, and to think that an action is brutal is to
evaluate it even if the claim has no negative valence (cf. Dancy 1995;
Kirchin 2013a, 2017; Roberts 2013b). This view can account for the
sense in which thick terms are descriptive by noting their
non-evaluative entailments. One challenge for irreducible thickness is
explaining what it is for a concept to evaluate the things to which it
applies without relying on the traditional view that evaluation is a
matter of encoding positive or negative valence in some way. It may be
that any view which treats thick concepts as irreducibly thick will
struggle to secure a tight connection between thick and thin concepts
while also carving up the structure of the evaluative domain in a
plausible way (Cannon 2020). This might be another reason (beyond
those noted in sections
 <a href="index-2.html#OughGapFactValuDist">2.1</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#ThicThinDiffKind">5.1</a>
 in the main text) to reconsider how tightly thick and thin concepts
are connected. It might (also or instead) be a reason to reconsider
the nature of the distinction between the evaluative and the
non-evaluative (Kirchin 2017: 137&ndash;39). Simon Kirchin defends a
&ldquo;liberal&rdquo; view of evaluation on which &ldquo;a concept can
be evaluative overall and in any particular instance of its use even
if in some instances there is no positive or negative stance being
expressed when it is employed&rdquo; (Kirchin 2017: 5). He suggests
that whether a given concept is evaluative is a matter of judgment and
debate which probably turns (perhaps among other things) on the
significance or centrality of its positive and negative uses to how we
understand the concept or the particular way of viewing the world it
provides (Kirchin 2017: 136). For instance, <span class="sc">contorted</span>
and <span class="sc">similar</span> might
count as evaluative concepts on this view. But it isn't fully clear
whether this view delivers an expanded notion of what concepts are
evaluative or instead a view on which some concepts are determinately
evaluative, others are determinately non-evaluative and in between
there is large borderline of concepts that aren&rsquo;t determinately
of either sort. A further articulation of this liberal view of
evaluation would thus be welcome.</p>

<h3 id="FurtCompBetwSemaPragView">3. Further Comparisons between Semantic and Pragmatic Views</h3>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#LocaQuesHowThicConcEval">Section 4</a>
 of the main text compares Semantic and Pragmatic Views on the
location question mainly with respect to their explanations of the
linguistic data, such as the projection and defeasibility behavior of
the evaluations normally conveyed by T-utterances. A significant
dimension of this debate is methodological. Even if we agree that
factors such as theoretical parsimony and unity make an explanation
better, comparisons of competing theories in terms of such factors are
complex. For instance, linguists generally agree with a principle
called &ldquo;Grice&rdquo;s Razor&rsquo;: if a phenomenon can be
explained and predicted in terms of independently motivated pragmatic
principles, then it is theoretically more parsimonious to do so than
to posit senses, semantic entailments, conventional implicatures, or
the like, which cannot be so explained (Grice 1978: 47&ndash;8).
Insofar as the evaluations normally conveyed by T-utterances can be
explained pragmatically without treating them as semantic or
conventional properties of thick terms, Grice&rsquo;s Razor implies
that the Pragmatic View is, other things being equal, preferable to
its rivals (V&auml;yrynen 2013: ch. 6). For example, the Semantic View
defended by Brent Kyle (2013a) not only posits for each thick term
separately that its meaning contains evaluation but in addition
invokes two distinct pragmatic mechanisms to explain why those
evaluations seem to project outside the scope of entailment-canceling
operators. However, the explanation given by the Pragmatic View seems
to suppose that the evaluation that projects is the same evaluation
when the embedding is a negation as when it is a question or a
possibility modal. Is it obvious that the evaluation conveyed by a
given thick term is the same in all relevant contexts? If not, the
greater parsimony of the pragmatic explanation may be lost. So it is
up for debate whether Grice&rsquo;s Razor favors the Pragmatic View in
this case. The appropriate methodology for assessing answers to the
location question merits more discussion.</p>

<p>
There are also other important comparisons to be made besides
explaining the relevant linguistic data. The plausibility of the
Pragmatic View depends on whether it can explain various further
phenomena that have been thought to support the Semantic View. One
such phenomenon is that even the maximal non-evaluative meanings of
thick terms underdetermine their extensions. This could be explained
if their extensions were determined in part by evaluation, as the
Semantic View says (Elstein and Hurka 2009). However, it can also be
explained in terms of more general factors that have nothing in
particular to do with whether the term is semantically evaluative
(V&auml;yrynen 2013: ch. 7). The conventional meanings of many
non-evaluative terms also underdetermine their extensions without
input from particular contexts. What counts as painful for a context
depends on whether not just the intensity of pain but also its
duration is relevant to the topic at hand, and on how these are
weighted. Different answers give different measures of painfulness.
Similarly, what counts as selfish depends on whether the conversation
concerns emotional selfishness, financial selfishness, or some
aggregate of these multiple dimensions of selfishness, and different
specifications of these non-evaluative parameters and their relative
weights lead to different measures of selfishness.</p>

<p>
Another phenomenon that might be thought to support the Semantic View
relates to Shapelessness
 (<a href="index-2.html#AntiDiseArgu">section 2.2</a>).
 If the extensions of thick terms aren&rsquo;t unified under
independently intelligible relations of non-evaluative similarity, you
might infer that the truth-conditions of T-utterances must be partly
evaluative. And one reason to accept Shapelessness is precisely that
there seems to be no non-evaluative characterization that could unify
all and only those things that fall under a given thick term. As
Margaret Little puts it, we cannot specify what the various ways of
being cruel&mdash;such as kicking a dog, teasing a sensitive person,
and forgetting to invite someone to a party&mdash;have in common, and
why the pain inflicted during a spinal tap doesn&rsquo;t count as
cruel, without helping ourselves to the evaluative concept <span class="sc">cruel</span>
(Little 2000: 279; see also Sreenivasan 2001:
19; Kirchin 2010: 6; Roberts 2011: 506). However, the extension of a
term <i>T</i> may in this way &ldquo;outrun&rdquo; characterizations
that can be given in independently intelligible terms even if <i>T</i>
is a non-evaluative term. It may not be possible to specify what all
and only instances of pain across sentient beings have in common
without helping ourselves to our concept <span class="sc">pain</span>.
But in that case the Pragmatic View can say that analogously there may
be no <em>cruel</em>-free way of characterizing the extension of
<em>cruel</em> and yet say that when we help ourselves to
<em>cruel</em> we aren&rsquo;t helping ourselves to an
<em>evaluative</em> concept. For if the Pragmatic View is true of
<em>cruel</em>, then a classification that deploys <em>cruel</em> is
itself a non-evaluative classification. So again a phenomenon that
might have been thought to support the Semantic View can be explained
even if the Semantic View is false, in terms of more general factors
that have nothing in particular to do with whether the terms in
question are semantically evaluative (V&auml;yrynen 2013:
193&ndash;201; V&auml;yrynen 2014). The resources cited here plus
further considerations concerning the context-sensitivity of thick
terms may also help explain why an outsider to an evaluative practice
involving a thick term <em>T</em> who grasps only characterizations of
its extension which can be given in <em>T</em>-free terms might not be
able to track insiders&rsquo; application of <em>T</em> (V&auml;yrynen
2013: ch. 6; see also Blackburn 2013).</p>

<h3 id="ThicTermPejo">4. Thick Terms and Pejoratives</h3>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#DeliQuesHowDoThicThinConcDiff">Section 5</a>
 of the main text focuses on how thick terms and concepts differ from
the thin. But a full delineation of the class of thick terms and
concepts requires determining also how they relate to other sorts of
evaluative terms. This will also matter to the broader methodological
question of whether a theory of thick concepts is better insofar as it
treats various sorts of evaluative terms in the same way or
differently. The main text briefly addresses affective terms such as
<em>admirable</em> and &ldquo;respect-relative&rdquo; evaluative
predicates such as <em>a good knife</em> and <em>good with
children</em>. These both count as thick by the intuitive
characterization that thick terms and concepts somehow combine
evaluation and non-evaluative description. But they also seem in some
ways different from paradigmatic thick terms such as <em>generous</em>
and <em>cruel</em>; the latter aren&rsquo;t explicitly pegged to a
particular attitude or to a completely independent non-evaluative kind
in the way that the former are.</p>

<p>
A potentially still more complicated case is that thick terms are
sometimes said to be similar to slurs, such as <em>kraut</em> and
<em>wop</em>, or other pejorative expressions, such as <em>slut</em>
and <em>jerk</em>, which all seem also to involve both evaluation and
description (Hare 1963; Blackburn 1992; Gibbard 1992; Boisvert 2008;
Richard 2008). It is common to locate the derogatory content of slurs
in their truth-conditions (Hom 2008) or conventional implicatures
(Williamson 2009). A unified presuppositional account of both slurs
and thick terms is proposed by Cepollaro and Stojanovic (2016) and
further developed by Cepollaro (2020). Pejoratives such as
<em>slut</em> and <em>jerk</em> may be different from slurs (Hay
2013).</p>

<p>
There are, however, enough differences in the linguistic behavior of
slurs and thick terms to make us pause before calling for a unified
treatment. One concerns their behavior in indirect reports:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li><span class="tag">(11)</span><span class="sen"> Pam believes/said
that Madonna&rsquo;s show is lewd. (But I think it isn&rsquo;t bad in
any way for being sexually explicit.)</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(12)</span> <span class="sen"> Pam believes/said
that Hans is a kraut. (? I think Hans is a fine person.)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
A speaker of (11) doesn&rsquo;t convey a negative evaluation of sexual
display, but a negative attitude seeps through the operator in (12).
So even in indirect reports slurs create a kind of discomfort which
thick terms one regards as objectionable don&rsquo;t. (You can verify
this by considering more explosive slurs than <em>kraut</em>.) Another
difference concerns defeasibility. Compare example (6) from the main
text with (13):</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li><span class="tag">(6)</span> <span class="sen"> Whether or not
this is a good thing, Isolde can be truthfully and neutrally described
as being chaste.</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(13)</span> <span class="sen"> # Whether or not
it&rsquo;s a bad thing, Hans can be truthfully and neutrally described
as a kraut.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
If differences such as these mean that the relationship between slurs
and derogation is tighter than the relationship between thick terms
and evaluation, then treating thick terms differently from slurs and
other pejoratives won&rsquo;t be a problem for any view (V&auml;yrynen
2013: 149&ndash;56). A different way that slurs might turn out to be
significantly similar to thick terms would be if the Pragmatic View
were correct of thick terms and the derogative meaning of slurs were
explained in terms of pragmatic or conversational inference (Bolinger
2017; Nunberg 2018). A further puzzle is how to understand terms which
in their metaphorical application to people seem both to be pejorative
and convey moral evaluation, such as <em>pig</em> and <em>snake</em>,
as well as rude gestures that seem to express thick concepts, such as
raising one&rsquo;s middle finger (see the vastly entertaining
Zangwill 2013).</p>

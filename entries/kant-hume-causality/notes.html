<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Kant and Hume on Causality</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Lewis White Beck&rsquo;s well-known essay, &ldquo;A Prussian Hume and
a Scottish Kant&rdquo; (1978), sketches these events in Kant&rsquo;s
intellectual development and firmly decides for the latter
alternative. In
 <a href="#note-20">footnote 20</a>
 of this work Beck credits Robert Paul Wolff (1960) especially for
developing the idea of &ldquo;Kant&rsquo;s debt to Hume via
Beattie&rdquo;; in this note, and the following one, Beck also
provides further helpful discussion (and references) concerning the
relationship between Kant, Hume, and Beattie.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 There are a number of other passages in Kant&rsquo;s 1766 essay which
are also clearly reminiscent of the <em>Enquiry</em>, and this much,
moreover, is not controversial. The existence of such parallels is
even emphasized by Beck (1978)&mdash;who, however, maintains that they
do not show that Kant directly derived his ideas from the
<em>Enquiry</em>. We follow the discussion of <em>Dreams of a
Spirit-Seer</em> by Alison Laywine (1993, chapter 6) in thinking that
these parallels do suggest that Kant very likely had Hume&rsquo;s
<em>Enquiry</em> firmly in mind in his essay of 1766, especially when
read against the background of Kant&rsquo;s earlier discussion of the
same topic in the essay on <em>Negative Magnitudes</em>. The remainder
of the present section will provide further evidence in support of
this view.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 The distinction between judgments of perception and judgments of
experience, which occurs only in the <em>Prolegomena</em>, is a
particularly vexed and controversial subject in Kant scholarship; and
it seems, in any case, that Kant abandoned this distinction in the
second edition of the <em>Critique</em> in favor of the view that
<em>all</em> genuine judgments must be objectively valid (see
especially &sect; 19 of the second edition Transcendental Deduction).
Nevertheless, Kant retains a central distinction between mere
&ldquo;perception&rdquo; and objective &ldquo;experience&rdquo;.
Indeed, Kant reformulates the general principle of the Analogies of
Experience in the second edition to read (B218): &ldquo;Experience is
possible only by means of the representation of a necessary connection
of perceptions&rdquo;. This formulation (unlike its predecessor in the
first edition at A176) is very close to the last-quoted passage from
the <em>Prolegomena</em> (4, 305; 58). [We note, for future reference,
that the three Analogies of Experience are, first, a principle of the
permanence of substance, second, a general principle that every
alteration must have a cause, and third, a principle of community or
causal interaction between simultaneously existing substances.]</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 In a preliminary section to the Transcendental Deduction (from which
we have quoted before) Kant makes essentially the same point (in both
editions), although without explicitly naming Hume
(A91&ndash;92/B123&ndash;123): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If one thought to extricate oneself from the difficulty of these
investigations by saying that experience unceasingly offers examples
of such rule-governedness of appearances, which provide sufficient
inducement for abstracting the concept of cause and, at the same time,
for thereby proving the objective validity of such a concept, then one
is failing to notice that the concept of cause can never arise in this
way. Rather, it must either be grounded completely a priori in the
understanding or be entirely abandoned as a mere phantom of the brain.
For this concept positively demands that something <em>A</em> be such
that something else <em>B</em> follow from it <em>necessarily</em> and
<em>in accordance with</em> <em>an absolutely universal rule</em>.
Appearances certainly provide cases from which a rule is possible in
accordance with which something usually happens, but never that the
succession is <em>necessary</em>; therefore, a dignity pertains to the
synthesis of cause and effect that cannot be empirically expressed at
all, namely, that the effect does not merely follow upon the cause but
is posited <em>through</em> it and follows <em>from</em> it. The
strict universality of the rule is certainly not a property of
empirical rules, which, through induction, can acquire nothing but
comparative universality: i.e., extensive utility.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 We believe that Hume&rsquo;s discussion of induction in the
<em>Treatise</em>, Book 1, part 3, section 6 is completely parallel to
the discussion in the <em>Enquiry</em>, section 4, part 2; in
particular, Hume&rsquo;s position is skeptical in both works. The
leading contemporary representative of the non-skeptical
interpretation of this argument, Don Garrett (1997), maintains, on the
contrary, that Hume, in these sections of the <em>Treatise</em> and
the <em>Enquiry</em>, is only making the purely descriptive claim that
&ldquo;reasoning&rdquo; cannot be the <em>cause</em> of our inductive
inferences.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 We believe, contrary to non-skeptical interpretations like
Garrett&rsquo;s
 (<a href="#note-5">note 5</a>
 above), that Hume&rsquo;s appeal to circularity here is normative or
justificatory: Hume is saying that a circular argument for the
principle of the uniformity of nature is simply begging the question
and, as such, it is a <em>fallacious</em> argument&mdash;not simply
one that happens to be causally inefficacious.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 The naturalistic interpretation initiated by Norman Kemp Smith
(1941), and then followed, for example, by Barry Stroud (1977),
emphasizes Hume&rsquo;s positive descriptive account of human nature.
The main import of Hume&rsquo;s treatment of induction, on this view,
is to show that custom or habit takes the place of reason in enabling
us to make inductive inferences. For both Kemp Smith and Stroud,
however, there is a preliminary skeptical stage in Hume&rsquo;s
argument (showing the insufficiency of the evidence provided by reason
for the principle of the uniformity of nature) which serves as a
vehicle, as it were, for establishing the impotence of reason and the
primacy of natural beliefs. Radical skepticism, on this view, is a
preliminary exercise which is then left behind once and for all. (For
further discussion, and criticism, of this &ldquo;vehicle view&rdquo;
see De Pierris 2001, 2002, 2015.) Recent non-skeptical interpretations
like Garrett (1997), and, following him, David Owen (1999), take
naturalism one step further and deny that there is even a preliminary
skeptical stage. The discussion of this issue by Henry Allison (2008)
is complex, but he expresses nuanced and qualified agreement with the
Garrett/Owen reading of <em>Treatise</em>, Book 1, part 3, section 6
and parallel texts.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Beck 1978 is a paradigmatic and influential articulation of this
wide-spread view. Beck helpfully distinguishes between the
&ldquo;every-event-some-cause&rdquo; principle and the
&ldquo;same-cause-same-effect&rdquo; principle. He argues that,
whereas Hume raises doubts concerning both principles, Kant only
intends to vindicate the first in the Second Analogy. Beck also places
particular emphasis on the fact that Hume discusses the first
principle solely in the <em>Treatise</em>, Book 1, part 3, section
3&mdash;as the &ldquo;general maxim in philosophy, that <em>whatever
begins to exist, must have a cause of existence</em>&rdquo; (T
1.3.3.1; SBN 78). By contrast, the <em>Enquiry</em> is concerned
solely with the second principle
(&ldquo;same-cause-same-effect&rdquo;). Thus, according to Beck, Kant
has no serious disagreement with Hume about this second
principle&mdash;and no serious disagreement, therefore, about the
status of particular synthetic a posteriori causal laws. [Indeed, it
is for this reason, on Beck&rsquo;s view, that it must have been
Kant&rsquo;s reading of Beattie&rsquo;s discussion of the
<em>Treatise</em> in 1772, rather than his reading of the
<em>Enquiry</em> approximately ten years earlier, which first woke
Kant from his &ldquo;dogmatic slumber&rdquo; (compare
 <a href="#note-1">note 1</a>
 above).] Others who have defended a position similar to Beck&rsquo;s
include H. J. Paton (1936), Robert Paul Wolff (1963), Gerd Buchdahl
(1969, 1972 [1974]), Graham Bird (1962), James Van Cleve (1973), and
Henry Allison (1983, 2004). Notable exceptions to this trend are
Arthur Melnick (1973) and Paul Guyer (1987, 2005: chapter 2, 2008:
chapter 2)&mdash;both of whom defend the view that causal relations as
described in the Second Analogy require the existence of particular
(empirical) causal laws as well. Nevertheless, both Melnick and Guyer
also appear to hold that the epistemic status of such laws, as far as
the Second Analogy is concerned, can only be broadly inductive (but
see also
 <a href="#note-9">note 9</a>
 below).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 This point is urged in Friedman 1992a, in opposition, especially, to
views like those defended by Buchdahl (1969) and Allison
(1983)&mdash;according to which causal relations between individual
events, for Kant, do not necessarily involve causal <em>laws</em> at
all. Allison responds in his 1996, chapter 6; see also the
corresponding discussion in Allison 2004. Guyer (2008, chapter 2)
articulates a view that is intermediate between our conception and the
Buchdahl/Allison view. As suggested in
 <a href="#note-8">note 8</a>
 above, Guyer, unlike Buchdahl, takes (empirical) causal laws to be
necessary for causal relations; like Buchdahl, however, he takes the a
priority and necessity of such laws, for Kant, to rest wholly on the
purely <em>regulative</em> function of reflective judgment. The
essence of our view, by contrast, is that precisely this a priority
and necessity has a crucial <em>constitutive</em> dimension, resting
on Kant&rsquo;s discussion of the category of necessity in the
Postulates of Empirical Thought: it is for precisely this reason, in
particular, that the (empirical) causal laws in question have a more
than merely inductive status. (For our conception of the role of
reflective judgment see
 <a href="#note-52">note 52</a>
 below.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 A few lines later, however, Kant refers to &ldquo;the dynamical law
of causality&rdquo; (in the singular) and &ldquo;the possibility
grounded thereon of inferring a priori from some given existence (a
cause) to another existence (the effect)&rdquo; (A228/B280). Here, as
the context makes clear, he is referring to the general principle of
the Second Analogy (that every event <em>b</em> must have a cause
<em>a</em>)&mdash;but, at the same time, he is also making it clear
that this general principle &ldquo;grounds&rdquo; the possibility of
particular causal laws (of the form every event of type <em>A</em>
must always be followed by an event of type <em>B</em>) which allow us
to &ldquo;infer a priori&rdquo; the existence of an effect
(<em>b</em>) from the existence of a cause (<em>a</em>). Thus, once
again, the general causal principle and particular causal laws are
inextricably connected for Kant (compare
 <a href="#note-9">note 9</a>
 above, together with the paragraph to which it is appended).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 For a detailed discussion of Kant&rsquo;s treatment of the law of
universal gravitation in &sect; 38 of the <em>Prolegomena</em> see
Friedman 1992b, chapter 4, and compare Friedman 2012.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Kant formulates his three &ldquo;laws of mechanics&rdquo; slightly
differently from Newton&rsquo;s three laws of motion: he does not
formulate Newton&rsquo;s second law (<em>F</em> =
<em>m</em><em>a</em>) explicitly, and Kant&rsquo;s first law is the
conservation of the total quantity of matter rather than the law of
inertia. (For both Newton and Kant the third law is the equality of
action and reaction.) We shall return to this matter in
 <a href="#note-32">note 32</a>
 below.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Beck (1978, note 45) explains: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Kant repeatedly asserts that empirical laws cannot be derived from a
priori principles of the understanding, yet he believed some of them
to be necessary. Those are the ones involved in an overall theory
whose principles are derived from the a priori principles of
&ldquo;rational science&rdquo; or &ldquo;pure physics&rdquo;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Beck also refers to the <em>Metaphysical Foundations</em> in this
connection. However, by not clearly distinguishing between the status
of synthetic a priori laws of pure natural science (like the laws of
motion) and synthetic a posteriori empirical laws made possible
thereby (like the law of gravitation), Beck (in our view) thereby
misses the crucial point of the present section: that even synthetic
<em>a posteriori</em> laws can acquire a material, empirical, or
causal necessity in virtue of the way in which they are
&ldquo;determined&rdquo;, in turn, by synthetic a priori laws.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 In Newton&rsquo;s explanation of his initial statement of the third
law communication of motion by impact figures prominently
(<em>Principia</em>, 417): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If some body impinging upon another body changes the motion of that
body in any way by its own force, then, by the force of the other body
(because of the equality of their mutual pressures), it also will in
turn undergo the same change in its own motion in the opposite
direction. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Then, in the following Scholium to the Laws of Motion, Newton
discusses the experimental evidence for the fundamental law of the
communication of motion by impact (equal changes of momentum
experienced by the two bodies) at considerable length
(<em>Principia</em>, 425&ndash;427). (Newton derives a general
principle of the conservation of momentum as Corollary 3 to the Laws
of Motion.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 See <em>Principia</em>, 404: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Because of the inertia of matter, every body is only with difficulty
put out of its state either of resting or of moving. Consequently,
inherent force [<em>vis insita</em>] may also be called by the very
significant name of force of inertia [<em>vis inertiae</em>].
Moreover, a body exerts this force only during a change of its state,
caused by another force impressed upon it, and this exercise of force
is, depending on the viewpoint, both resistance and impetus:
resistance insofar as the body, in order to maintain its state,
strives against the impressed force, and impetus insofar as the same
body, yielding only with difficulty to the force of a resisting
obstacle, endeavors to change the state of that obstacle. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It appears, then, that the force of bodies to which Newton refers in
his explanation of the third law of motion
 (<a href="#note-14">note 14</a>
 above) is precisely the force of inertia.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 In Locke&rsquo;s empiricist version of this philosophy, if we could
(<em>per impossibile</em>) penetrate into the inner microscopic
constitution of bodies (their &ldquo;real essences&rdquo;), we would
know without experience (in Locke&rsquo;s terminology, &ldquo;without
Trial&rdquo;) the causal connections among bodies. For example, Locke
writes (<em>Essay</em>, IV, III, 25): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I doubt not but if we could discover the Figure, Size, Texture, and
Motion of the minute Constituent parts of any two Bodies, we should
know without Trial several of their Operations one upon another, as we
do now the Properties of a Square, or a Triangle. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In this way, despite his empiricism, Locke preserves the rationalist
ideal (as in Descartes and Leibniz, for example) of an a priori
demonstrative science of nature. Yet Locke, as an empiricist, is
deeply skeptical about our ability ever to have access to the exact
configurations of the hidden microscopic parts in question. Hence, the
ideal of a genuine &ldquo;Science&rdquo; or &ldquo;Knowledge&rdquo; of
nature is in fact unattainable, and we must instead be content with
mere &ldquo;Belief&rdquo; or &ldquo;Opinion&rdquo; based on
experiments. For example, Locke writes (<em>Essay</em>, IV, XII, 10):
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I deny not, but a Man accustomed to rational and regular Experiments
shall be able to see farther into the Nature of Bodies, and guess
righter at their yet unknown Properties, than one, that is a Stranger
to them: But yet, as I have said, this is but Judgment and Opinion,
not Knowledge and Certainty. This <em>way</em> of getting, <em>and
improving our Knowledge of Substances only by</em> <em>Experience</em>
and History &hellip; makes me suspect, that natural Philosophy is not
capable of being made a Science.</p>

 I. Bernard Cohen, in the &ldquo;Guide to Newton&rsquo;s
<em>Principia</em>&rdquo; included in his translation (1999), explains
that the terms &ldquo;intension&rdquo; and &ldquo;remission&rdquo; go
back to late-medieval doctrine referring to qualities that
&ldquo;undergo an intension or remission by degrees&rdquo; (Cohen
1999: 200). See Alexandre Koyr&eacute; 1965, chapter 6, for a
discussion of how the Rules Newton added to the second and third
editions were developed in response to the rationalist proponents of
the mechanical philosophy.</p>

 Rule 4, added to the third edition in 1726, makes it even more
explicit that inductive generalization is to be rigorously extended
without interference from hypotheses (such as those of the mechanical
philosophy), so that only further <em>observed</em> phenomena can then
limit the truly universal scope of the resulting generalizations
(<em>Principia</em>, 796): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In experimental philosophy, propositions gathered from phenomena by
induction should be considered either exactly or very nearly true
notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses, until yet other phenomena
make such propositions either more exact or liable to exceptions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The explanation of Rule 4 reads (ibid.): &ldquo;This rule should be
followed so that arguments based on induction may not be nullified by
hypotheses&rdquo;. Koyr&eacute; (1965: chapter 6) argues that Rule 4
was added to the third edition precisely because defenders of the
mechanical philosophy still persisted in rejecting universal
gravitation after the second edition.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Thus, for example, after sketching the inductive argument for
unrestricted universal gravitation, Newton continues
(<em>Principia</em>, 796): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, the argument from phenomena will be even stronger for
universal gravity than for the impenetrability of bodies, for which,
of course, we have not a single experiment, and not even an
observation, in the case of the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 Similarly, Hume takes the law of gravitation to be on an equal
footing with the inductively arrived at general principles of
elasticity, cohesion of parts, and communication of motion by impulse
(EHU 4.12; SBN 30&ndash;31): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Elasticity, gravity, cohesion of parts, communication of motion by
impulse, these are probably the ultimate causes and principles which
we shall ever discover in nature; and we may esteem ourselves
sufficiently happy, if by accurate enquiry and reasoning, we can trace
up the particular phenomena to, or near to, these general
principles.</p>

 The similarity appears even more striking when we note that Newton
formulates the same supposition in Query 31 of the <em>Opticks</em> as
&ldquo;Nature will be very conformable to her self and very
simple&rdquo; (<em>Opticks</em>, 397). For further discussion of the
evidence for taking Hume&rsquo;s inductive method to be modelled on

 Tom L. Beauchamp and Alexander Rosenberg (1981) neglect the
circularity argument and maintain, following Kemp Smith (1941), that
Hume is a skeptic only concerning the use of a priori reason in causal
inferences: Hume merely intends to show that there is no
<em>demonstrative</em> argument for the principle of the uniformity of
nature. Annette Baier (1991) endorses this view and adds an
interpretation of the circularity argument according to which it is a
<em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of rationalism. We believe, however,
that the argument is aimed precisely at Newton&rsquo;s (and
Hume&rsquo;s own) use of the principle of the uniformity of
nature&mdash;and, therefore, that this situation brings out the mutual
autonomy of Hume&rsquo;s two standpoints (the standpoint of radical
skepticism and the natural standpoint of science and common life)
especially clearly: see notes

 Robert Fogelin (1985) emphasizes Hume&rsquo;s radical skepticism
concerning induction, and he also argues that Hume&rsquo;s radical
skeptical argument has the consequence, ultimately, that necessity is
no longer an essential ingredient in our idea of causation:
Hume&rsquo;s view of causation thus reduces to a pure regularity
conception according to which causation is based solely on constant
conjunction. We believe, on the contrary, that necessity remains an
essential ingredient in Hume&rsquo;s conception of causation and that
it has normative force&mdash;even though it is projected from a
subjective feeling of determination (an impression of reflection)
arising from our inductive inferences themselves. For further
discussion see De Pierris 2002, 2015.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 Hume&rsquo;s skepticism about our knowledge of causal relations is
very different from Locke&rsquo;s and, more generally, so is his
conception of causal necessity. As we have seen
 (<a href="#note-16">note 16</a>
 above), Locke preserves the rationalist ideal of the mechanical
philosophy of an a priori demonstrative science of nature, but he is
skeptical about ever attaining it. Hume, by contrast, entirely rejects
this a priori demonstrative model of causation and <em>replaces</em>
the rationalist ideal, once and for all, with the opposing Newtonian
inductive ideal. There is thus a fundamental asymmetry between
Hume&rsquo;s skepticism concerning the a priori model of causal
explanation of the mechanical philosophy and his skepticism concerning
Newton&rsquo;s (and his own) inductive method. Within the naturalistic
standpoint of science and common life, Hume emphatically endorses the
inductive method&mdash;but not the a priori model of causal
explanation. The inductive method follows natural principles of
association of the mind and relies only on experience. By contrast,
the a priori reasoning of the mechanical philosophers, involving the
hypothetical postulation of a hidden configuration of properties of
tiny parts of matter and their powers demonstratively necessitating
its effects, does not follow such natural operations. This asymmetry
also reveals itself in the character of Hume&rsquo;s positive notion
of necessity, within the standpoint of common life and science. He
explains this notion in terms of a natural and inevitable projection
from our inductive inferences, while the necessity of hidden powers
postulated by the mechanical philosophy has no analogue at all in any
natural operations of the mind. Hume simply rejects this inherited
notion of necessity once and for all&mdash;from <em>both</em> the
naturalistic and radically skeptical standpoints. Locke, despite his
empiricism (and despite his own debt to Newton), never takes the step
of replacing the rationalist ideal of a demonstrative science of
nature with the purely inductive Newtonian ideal; and it is for
precisely this reason, we believe, that the Lockean &ldquo;skeptical
realist&rdquo; interpretation of Hume&mdash;defended, for example, by
John P. Wright (1983) and Galen Strawson (1989)&mdash;is fundamentally
mistaken. For further details on the relationship between Hume, Locke,
and Newton see De Pierris 2006, 2015: chapter 3.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 The crucial methodological difference between Hume and the mechanical
philosophy is that Hume, following Newton, emphasizes purely inductive
arguments as opposed to the hypothetical postulation of a hidden
microscopic constitution of bodies. In Locke&rsquo;s empiricist
version of the mechanical philosophy there is an a priori commitment
to the existence of such a hidden constitution (a &ldquo;real
essence&rdquo;), while, at the same time, Locke remains skeptical
about our access to such a constitution
 (<a href="#note-25">note 25</a>
 above). Hume, by contrast, dispenses with this a priori commitment
and adopts the Newtonian notion of &ldquo;experimental proof&rdquo; or
&ldquo;proof by experiment&rdquo; as the paradigm of our best science
of nature. Such proofs proceed via the inductive methodology
articulated in Rule 3 of Book 3 of the <em>Principia</em> for
inferring universal generalizations from completely uniform experience
(see the paragraph to which
 <a href="#note-18">note 18</a>
 above is appended, together with the following
 <a href="#note-19">note 19</a>).
 It is precisely this notion of <i>inductive</i> proof that
characterizes Hume&rsquo;s own conception of scientific methodology and
decisively distinguishes him from the mechanical philosophy, including
that of both Boyle and Locke: see De Pierris 2015, chapter 3. In both
the <i>Treatise</i> (T 1.3.11) and the <i>Enquiry</i> (section 10,
part 1) Hume draws a contrast between the superior certainty of
conclusions based on proofs from uniform constant experience and that
of merely probable conclusions based on non-uniform experience
involving a contrariety of evidence (as in human testimony). It is
precisely the latter, however, that is emphasized in the experimental
method of Boyle and Locke. This central methodological difference
between Hume and the mechanical philosophers has not been considered,
even by commentators who acknowledge Hume&rsquo;s more general debt to
Newton. Moreover, ignoring the importance of the Newtonian notion of
(inductive) proof in Hume has led some recent commentators to identify
Hume&rsquo;s conception of experimental method with Boyle&rsquo;s. An
influential example is Barfoot 1990, which rightly points out that
Hume, in <i>The History of England</i>, emphasizes the importance of
Boyle&rsquo;s hydrostatics. Yet Barfoot does not consider the
conclusion of the discussion of Boyle&rsquo;s hydrostatics, where Hume
directs our attention to Boyle &ldquo;being a great partizan of the
mechanical philosophy&rdquo; and criticizes that philosophy for
&ldquo;allowing us to imagine&rdquo; the &ldquo;secrets of
nature&rdquo; that we have not yet discovered&mdash;thereby flattering our
&ldquo;natural vanity&rdquo; (HE VI, 541). Barfoot also fails to appreciate Hume&rsquo;s immediately following paragraph on
Newton, which begins (HE VI, 542): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In Newton this island may boast of having produced the greatest and
rarest genius that ever arose for the ornament and instruction of the
species. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hume praises Newton as </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[c]autious in admitting no principles but such as were founded on
experiment; but resolute to adopt every such principle, however new or
unusual. (ibid.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For the only &ldquo;principles&rdquo; one can &ldquo;resolutely&rdquo;
admit, according to the &ldquo;cautious&rdquo; inductive method, are
universal generalizations derived from completely uniform
experience&mdash;including such surprising and &ldquo;unusual&rdquo;
generalizations as the law of universal gravitation. Hume emphatically
concludes by contrasting Newton&rsquo;s position vis-&agrave;-vis the
mechanical philosophy with Boyle&rsquo;s (<i>ibid</i>.): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
While Newton seemed to draw off the veil from some of the mysteries of
nature, he shewed at the same time the imperfections of the mechanical
philosophy; and thereby restored her ultimate secrets to that
obscurity, in which they ever did and ever will remain. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is quite clear that Hume&rsquo;s comparison of the two here is
favorable to Newton and unfavorable to Boyle. For detailed further
discussion of challenges to a Newtonian reading of Hume&rsquo;s
experimental method see De Pierris 2015, chapter 3, section 5.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-28">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 This is the one place where Newton explicitly appeals to Rule 3 in
the argument, namely, in Corollary 2 to Proposition 6
(<em>Principia</em>, 809): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
All bodies universally that are on or near the earth are heavy [or
gravitate] toward the earth, and the weights of all bodies that are
equally distant from the center of the earth are as the quantities of
matter in them. This is a quality of all bodies on which experiments
can be performed and therefore by Rule 3 is to be affirmed of all
bodies universally.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-29">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>
 This conclusion depends on Proposition 69 of Book 1, where Newton
applies the third law of motion to conclude that, if a system of
several bodies all attract one another in accordance with the
inverse-square law and with weights proportional to mass (as in
Galileo&rsquo;s law of fall), then the accelerations generated by any
two bodies in the system will be directly proportional to their masses
when the bodies so attracted are considered at equal distances. Thus,
for example, we can thereby compute the mass of Jupiter from the
accelerations of its satellites and compare this quantity with the
mass of Saturn: all accelerations towards each of these primary bodies
obey the inverse-square law and (in accordance with Galileo&rsquo;s
law of fall) depend only on the distance from the primary body and the
primary body itself; but, by universality, Jupiter and Saturn
accelerate towards one another in accordance with the same law of
proportionality; applying the equality of action and reaction to the
mutual accelerations between Jupiter and Saturn then yields the result
that these accelerations are proportional to the respective masses of
the two bodies; and, by varying the distance in question all the way
back down to the region of their respective satellites, we can then
compute the (relative) masses of Jupiter and Saturn from the
accelerations of their satellites. For further discussion of this
stage of the argument&mdash;and the way in which it is entangled with
the Newtonian concepts of (absolute) space, time, and motion&mdash;see
Friedman 1992b (chapter 3, &sect; III) and 2013.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>
 After giving the argument for the first part of his conclusion (see
 <a href="#note-29">note 29</a>
 above) Newton continues (<em>Principia</em>, 810&ndash;811): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Further, since all the parts of any planet A are heavy [or gravitate]
toward any planet B, and since the gravity of each part is to the
gravity of the whole as the [quantity of] matter of that part to the
[quantity of] matter of the whole, and since to every action (by the
third law of motion) there is an equal and opposite reaction, it
follows that planet B will gravitate in turn toward all the parts of
planet A, and its gravity toward any one part will be to its gravity
toward the whole of the planet as the matter of that part is to the
matter of the whole. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Newton is here appealing to the well-known property of terrestrial
gravity that weight is compositional: the weight of a compound body is
equal to the sum of the weights of its constituent parts. This
property can then be extended to the &ldquo;weights&rdquo; of any body
towards any other body by the argument of Proposition 7. But, by the
third law of motion, if one body is &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; towards
another body, then this last body must also be &ldquo;heavy&rdquo;
towards the first. For the relationship between this stage of
Newton&rsquo;s inductive argument and Hume&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rules by
which to judge of causes and effects&rdquo; see De Pierris 2006 and
2015, chapter 3.</p>

 See Proposition 7 of the second or Dynamics chapter (4, 512; 50):

Again, for the relationship between this property of the
&ldquo;original&rdquo; force of attraction&mdash;its
immediacy&mdash;and the Newtonian concepts of (absolute) space, time,
and motion see Friedman 1992b (chapter 3, &sect; III) and 2013.</p>

 See
 <a href="#note-12">note 12</a>
 above, together with the paragraph to which it is appended. Since
Kant takes the equality of action and reaction, in the first instance,
to govern changes of momentum (rather than the forces which produce
such changes), he actually does not need to formulate Newton&rsquo;s
second law separately. Moreover, since Kant places particular emphasis
on the equality of action and reaction, he is (in effect) elevating
Corollary 3 to Newton&rsquo;s laws (what we now call the conservation
of momentum: see
 <a href="#note-14">note 14</a>
 above) to the status of a fundamental law. Kant&rsquo;s use of the
conservation of the total quantity of matter (in accordance with the
transcendental principle of the conservation of substance) in place of
Newton&rsquo;s second law is a reflection of this situation.</p>

<p>
The original attractive force, on which the very possibility of matter
as such rests, extends immediately to infinity throughout the

</blockquote>

<p>
Kant therefore builds both universality and immediacy (compare
 <a href="#note-31">note 31</a>
 above) into the metaphysical &ldquo;dynamical theory of matter&rdquo;
he develops in this chapter. Further discussion of Kant&rsquo;s
metaphysical theory of matter is beyond the scope of the present
article. We note, however, that Kant is here radically revising a
broadly Leibnizian metaphysics of matter he had earlier developed in
the pre-critical period, and Kant&rsquo;s pre-critical version of a
Leibnizian metaphysics has led some recent commentators&mdash;notably
Eric Watkins (2005)&mdash;to develop an interpretation of Kant&rsquo;s
conception of causality in the <em>critical</em> period that is
markedly more Leibnizian (and thus more Aristotelian) than the present
account.</p>

 This distinction between &ldquo;appearance&rdquo; and
&ldquo;experience&rdquo; is developed in the fourth chapter or
Phenomenology of the <em>Metaphysical Foundations</em>, whose subject,
in general, is the transformation of merely &ldquo;apparent&rdquo;
motions into &ldquo;true&rdquo; motions. In particular, the
&ldquo;phenomena&rdquo; described by Kepler&rsquo;s laws are so far
merely apparent motions (relative to their primary bodies), whereas
the everywhere mutual inverse-square accelerations described by the
law of universal gravitation are true motions (relative to the center
of gravity of the solar system). For further discussion of this point
see Friedman 2013, chapter 4.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-37">

 See again the references cited in
 <a href="#note-27">note 27</a>
 (and
 <a href="#note-34">34</a>)
 above. Kant identifies the effect of the fundamental force of
attraction with gravitation in a note to Proposition 8 of the Dynamics
chapter (4, 518; 56): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The <em>action</em> [or effect] of the universal attraction
immediately exerted by each matter on all matters, and at all
distances, is called <em>gravitation</em>; the tendency to move in the
direction of greater gravitation is <em>weight</em>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What is Kant&rsquo;s justification for this identification? This is a
subtle and delicate point, into which we cannot enter fully here. In
the end, however, the only justification Kant has to offer is that the
force of universal gravitation has all the essential properties of his
own fundamental force of attraction: immediacy, universality, and
proportionality to mass (compare notes
 <a href="#note-30">30</a>
 and
 <a href="#note-34">34</a>
 above). Hence, Kant&rsquo;s justification for making this
identification must ultimately depend on empirical facts. The
identification is also framed, however, by an a priori &ldquo;special
metaphysics&rdquo; of nature (including Kant&rsquo;s metaphysical
&ldquo;dynamical theory of
 matter&rdquo;&mdash;<a href="#note-35">note 35</a>
 above), which, in turn, is itself framed by the a priori
transcendental principles of the pure understanding constituting a
&ldquo;general metaphysics&rdquo; of nature: the result, although
empirical, is certainly not, from Kant&rsquo;s point of view, merely
inductive.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-38">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-38">38.</a>
 See Proposition 2 of the Phenomenology (4, 556&ndash;557; 96): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The circular motion of a matter, as distinct from the opposite motion
of the space, is an <em>actual</em> predicate of this matter; by
contrast, the opposite motion of a relative space, assumed instead of
the motion of the body, is no actual motion of the latter, but, if
taken as such, is mere semblance [<em>Schein</em>]. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Kant illustrates this by Newton&rsquo;s example, from the famous
Scholium to the Definitions (on absolute space, time, and motion) at
the beginning of the <em>Principia</em>, of two bodies connected by a
cord mutually rotating about a common central point. By the law of
inertia, the two bodies would fly off along the tangent if there were
no cord, and so there must be a true centripetal acceleration (due to
the elastic force of the cord itself) holding them in. Thus, the two
bodies are truly mutually rotating, and a contrary motion of the
surrounding space (e.g., the fixed stars) would be mere semblance.
Newton intends this example, it is clear, as a model for his own
inference from the apparent to the true motions in the solar system in
Book 3.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-39">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-39">39.</a>
 In an unpublished <em>Reflexion</em>, written between the late 1770s
and mid 1780s, Kant illustrates the transformation in question by
precisely the transition from Kepler to Newton (R 5414; 18, 176): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Empirically one can certainly discover rules, but not laws&mdash;as
Kepler in comparison with Newton&mdash;for to the latter belongs
necessity, and hence that they are cognized a priori. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The above discussion of Kant&rsquo;s reconstruction of the Newtonian
&ldquo;deduction from the phenomena&rdquo; of the law of universal
gravitation emphasizes the Postulates of Empirical Thought and thus
the modal categories. Friedman (2017) extends the account by
emphasizing the derived pure concept of the understanding or
&ldquo;predicable&rdquo; of force (which falls under the category of
causality). In particular, when the Newtonian force of universal
gravitation is considered from this point of view, it is treated as a
mathematical quantity abstracted from all hypothetical mechanisms that
may be invoked to explain it (such as a vortex model for example). The
force (and corresponding law) thereby acquires a considerably stronger
epistemic status (than that of a mere hypothesis) by means of the empirical
measurements Newton describes for establishing its mathematical
properties. Compare Kant&rsquo;s discussion of what he calls
&ldquo;moving forces&rdquo; in the Second Analogy (A206-207/B252).

Nature</em> in which Friedman (2017) appears represent the state of the

 A single sidereal day, for example, is determined by the return of a

further corrections in the light of Newtonian gravitational astronomy
itself. Just as Kant holds that the ordinary conception of motion
based on a stationary earth must be subject to an indefinite series of
successive corrections based on ever more extended relative spaces
(compare
 <a href="#note-41">note 41</a>
 above), he is also aware that the ordinary measure of time to which
he refers in the passage from the Refutation of Idealism is subject to
an indefinite process of corrections by the evolving procedures of
(post-Copernican) astronomy. Indeed, Kant was the first to envision an
especially important such correction, in his essay on <em>Whether the
Earth has Undergone an Alteration of its Axial Rotation</em> (1754),
which introduces an irregularity or nonuniformity into the
<em>sidereal</em> rotation of the earth due to tidal friction. Thus,
whereas the law of inertia implies that the earth will rotate
uniformly in perpetuity in empty space, the action of external
gravitational forces on the earth (principally from the sun and the
moon) introduces a number of irregularities into this
rotation&mdash;including the precession of the equinoxes already
described by Newton in the <em>Principia</em>, the further precession
or &ldquo;nutation&rdquo; of the earth&rsquo;s axis described by the
astronomer James Bradley, and the effects of tidal friction which were
initially described by Kant himself.</p>

 According to the abstract standard of temporal uniformity defined by
the laws of motion, two temporal intervals are truly equal just in
case they represent the times during which an inertially moving body
would traverse equal distances. No bodies are actually moving
inertially, however, because of the universality of gravitational
force. Yet the theory of universal gravitation itself then allows us
systematically to take these forces into account, and to correct the
actually non-uniform motions accordingly.</p>

 Because of this law, therefore, each motion of a body at a given time
follows from the motions of bodies at earlier times, and </p>

<p>
there must thus lie in that which precedes an event as such the
condition for a rule according to which this event follows always and
necessarily. (A193/B238&ndash;239)</p>

 It is no accident, therefore, that Kant illustrates the category of
community, in the second edition of the <em>Critique</em>, precisely
by the (instantaneous) gravitational interaction between the earth and
the moon: see the &ldquo;proof&rdquo; of the Third Analogy at
B256&ndash;258.</p>

 Compare again the passage from the second edition Introduction
already quoted above (B5): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The very concept of cause so obviously contains the concept of a
necessity of the connection with an effect and a strict universality
of the rule, that the concept [of cause] would be entirely lost if one
pretended to derive it, as Hume did, from a frequent association of
that which happens with that which precedes, and [from] a thereby
arising custom (thus a merely subjective necessity) of connecting
representations. </p>

 Since Kant is here emphasizing the general causal principle of the
Second Analogy, the interpretation of this passage is especially
controversial. Some commentators&mdash;e.g., Beck (1978:
126&ndash;127)&mdash;take Kant to be here <em>endorsing</em> the
&ldquo;generally accepted view&rdquo; (of particular empirical causal
laws), </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
according to which we have only been first guided by the perception
and comparison of many concurring sequences of events following on
certain appearances to discover a rule, in accordance with which
certain events always follow on certain appearances. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In section 2 above we discussed in detail the relationship between the
general causal principle of the Second Analogy (that every event
<em>b</em> must have a cause <em>a</em>) and the particular empirical
causal laws (of the form all events of kind <em>A</em> must be
followed by events of kind <em>B</em>) which, according to Kant, must
&ldquo;stand under&rdquo; the general causal principle. In the passage
at A195&ndash;196/B24&ndash;241 Kant is in fact referring to both
types of &ldquo;rules&rdquo;&mdash;the general rule &ldquo;that
everything that happens has a cause&rdquo; and also the particular
rules (causal laws of nature) &ldquo;in accordance with which certain
events always follow on certain appearances&rdquo;. As we saw in
section 2, while the former is synthetic <em>a priori</em>, for Kant,
even <em>a posteriori</em> causal laws of nature still possess an
empirical or material necessity in accordance with the Postulates of
Empirical Thought&mdash;and are thereby both necessary and universally
valid in the sense of &sect; 29 of the <em>Prolegomena</em>. We
explained how the law of universal gravitation, for Kant, possesses
precisely this empirical or material necessity in section 3 above:

 As suggested in notes
 <a href="#note-23">23</a>
 and
 <a href="#note-25">25</a>
 above, we believe that Hume&rsquo;s very complex position reveals the
existence of two mutually autonomous standpoints in Hume&rsquo;s
epistemology: on the one side, the standpoint of radical skepticism,
where Hume calls into question our most fundamental natural beliefs
and seeks for their ultimate justification, and, on the other side,
the standpoint of common life and science, where these same natural
beliefs are not called into question but are refined and improved by
the normative reflection of the &ldquo;wise man&rdquo;, the
<em>mitigated</em> skeptic, and the scientist. For further discussion
see De Pierris 2001, 2002, 2015.</p>

 If this is correct, there might be something importantly right about
&ldquo;Kant&rsquo;s debt to Hume via Beattie&rdquo; after all (compare
notes
 <a href="#note-1">1</a>
 and
 <a href="#note-8">8</a>
 above, together with the paragraphs to which they are appended).
Kant&rsquo;s awareness of Hume&rsquo;s discussion of the general
causal principle in the <em>Treatise</em> (derived from reading
Beattie after 1772) may have led him to the idea that this principle
(together with the other principles of what will eventually become the
three Analogies of Experience) could serve as a (synthetic) a priori
realization of Hume&rsquo;s principle of the uniformity of nature.
Such a new awareness would not have represented Kant&rsquo;s first
acquaintance with &ldquo;Hume&rsquo;s problem&rdquo; (which awoke him
from his dogmatic slumber), but it may have been an important step
towards Kant&rsquo;s ultimate <em>solution</em> to the problem in the
critical period.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-52">52.</a>
 Kant&rsquo;s argument in the <em>Metaphysical Foundations of Natural
Science</em> provides a specific realization or instantiation of this
idea in the case of Newton&rsquo;s theory of universal gravitation:
Newtonian mathematical demonstrations, in the context of the Newtonian
mathematical theory of space, time, and motion, can indeed lead to a
more than merely inductive status for an especially important
empirical causal law. Kant then supposes that the mathematical theory
of space and time, as further determined via the Analogies of
Experience, can (at least in principle) do something similar for
lower-level empirical laws such as the sun warming the stone. The
question of the relationship between lower-level empirical laws and
the &ldquo;pure natural science&rdquo; discussed in the
<em>Metaphysical Foundations</em> is especially difficult, however,
and it involves us, eventually, with the new questions about the
relationship between empirical laws and the transcendental principles
of the understanding raised in the <em>Critique of Judgment</em>: for
further discussion see Friedman 1992a, 1992b, 2013.</p>

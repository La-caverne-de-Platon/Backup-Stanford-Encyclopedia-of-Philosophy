<h2>A. <em>Aufbau</em></h2>

<p>
It was long assumed that the sole point of Carnap&rsquo;s
<em>Aufbau</em> was the one Quine (1951: 39) attributed to it: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Radical reductionism&hellip; set itself the task of specifying a
sense-datum language and showing how to translate the rest of
significant discourse &hellip; into it. Carnap embarked on this
project in the <em>Aufbau</em>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A similar conception, though more appreciative of the book&rsquo;s
merits, was endorsed by Nelson Goodman (1951) and in subsequent
critique of the <em>Aufbau</em>. Michael Friedman (1987) cast doubt on
such a view, pointing out that it is inconsistent with many features
of the text, not least its overriding preoccupation with the
structural content of predicates and sentences. Friedman (2000, 2007)
and subsequent investigators (Richardson 1998; Mormann 2003, 2004;
Pincock 2002, 2005; Nasrin 2004; Tsou 2003; Carus 2007a: Ch.
5&ndash;6; the papers in Damb&ouml;ck 2016) have explored these
questions further, but can hardly be said to have got to the bottom of
this rich and enigmatic book. It continues to fascinate, and cannot be
reduced to a single doctrine or preoccupation. The literature on it
has grown to formidable proportions. Here we restrict ourselves to a
few basic perspectives that recent philosophers have been particularly
interested in: the constitution systems of the <em>Aufbau</em>,
Carnap&rsquo;s structuralism in the <em>Aufbau</em>, the reception and
later discussion of the book, and finally a section on one particular
response to it, Quine&rsquo;s criticism of Carnap&rsquo;s construction
of three-dimensional space from the two-dimensional visual field in
the <em>Aufbau</em>. </p>

<h3 id="ConsSyst">1. Constitution Systems</h3>

<p>
Carnap&rsquo;s overall goal in the <em>Aufbau</em> is the design,
study, and application of so-called constitution systems
(&ldquo;Konstitutionssysteme&rdquo;, translated as
&ldquo;constructional systems&rdquo; in the English translation of the
<em>Aufbau</em>, though we prefer the term &ldquo;constitution
systems&rdquo;): linguistic frameworks supplying all of the (names
for) objects and concepts required by science. (Though these
frameworks are not yet investigated with the help of a formalized
metatheory&mdash;a &ldquo;syntax theory&rdquo;&mdash;as this would be
the case later in Carnap&rsquo;s <em>Logical Syntax</em>; see the
supplement on
 <a href="syntax.html"><em>Logical Syntax of Language</em></a>.)
 Any such constitution system is supposed to be &ldquo;a rational
reconstruction of the entire formation of reality, which, in
cognition, is carried out for the most part intuitively&rdquo;
(<em>Aufbau</em>: &sect;100). In line with the &ldquo;unity of
science&rdquo; ideal prevailing in the Vienna Circle at the time, each
constitution system should suffice for <em>all</em> of science: while
Carnap acknowledges that there are various different kinds, types, or
levels of objects and concepts (subjective ones, physical ones,
cultural ones, and so on), he also maintains that sentences about any
such kind may always be transformed into sentences of a more basic
kind until every sentence is translated into one consisting only of
basic concepts and concerning only basic individuals.</p>

<p>
The method by which higher-level objects and concepts are to be
constituted from basic ones is <em>definition</em> (see &sect;2 in the
<em>Aufbau</em>), where definitions may be &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; (by
which Carnap means definitional equalities, as in &ldquo;\(R
=\ldots\)&rdquo;, &sect;38) or &ldquo;definitions in use&rdquo;, which
include what we now call explicit definitions of predicates (e.g.,
<em>for all <i>x</i></em>, \(y: R(x, y) \leftrightarrow_{\df} \ldots
x\ldots y\ldots)\) as well as contextual definitions (e.g.,
Russell&rsquo;s elimination of definite descriptions in sentential
contexts, &sect;39).</p>

<p>
Thus, a constitution system in the <em>Aufbau</em> is nothing but:
</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(C1)</dt>
<dd> An interpreted language with both syntactic and semantic
components, even though neither syntax nor semantics are determined in
formally precise terms in the <em>Aufbau</em>. </dd>
</dl>

<p>
(This contrasts with Carnap&rsquo;s later works, such as <em>The
Logical Syntax of Language</em>, in which the syntax of languages is
developed with formal precision, and <em>Meaning and Necessity</em>,
where both syntax and semantics are laid down precisely. See the
supplements on
 <a href="syntax.html"><em>Logical Syntax of Language</em></a>
 and
 <a href="semantics.html">Semantics</a>,
 respectively.) </p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(C2)</dt>
<dd> A system of definitions. </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Both parts of a constitution system are discussed metalinguistically,
using informal expressions from natural language, mathematics,
science, and traditional philosophy.</p>

<p>
The language of any such constitution system is given jointly by its
descriptive vocabulary (primitive predicates expressing the basic
concepts), logical operators, and variables. The syntactic formation
rules of the language are those of the logical system of simple type
theory, although the rules are not stated explicitly in the
<em>Aufbau</em>. Accordingly, for every constitution system envisaged
in the <em>Aufbau,</em> its logical operators are those of simple type
theory, which includes separate quantifiers and variables for
individuals (basic objects), properties and relations of individuals,
properties and relations of such properties and relations, and so
forth. By means of the definitions, all sentences with defined terms
are translatable into sentences involving only primitive predicates,
logical operators, and variables. In the same way, mathematical
concepts are meant to be reduced to logical ones (just as modern set
theory reduces mathematical concepts to logical concepts and the
membership relation). In this way, mathematical laws are translatable
into laws of simple type theory which Carnap regards as
<em>logical</em> laws, in line with the form of logicism (reducibility
of mathematics to logic) that he defends at the time. (Carnap&rsquo;s
later 1931 article on &ldquo;The Logicist Foundations of
Mathematics&rdquo; gives a very good survey of logicism about
mathematics more generally.)</p>

<p>
When some high-level statement is reduced to one that is solely
expressed in terms of primitive expressions, the resulting reduction
is only supposed to preserve extension (&ldquo;logical value&rdquo;),
not (Fregean) sense or intension (&ldquo;epistemic value&rdquo;,
<em>Aufbau</em>: &sect;50). As Carnap argues, different senses may be
attached to one and the same formula in one and the same constitution
system: e.g., sentences in his phenomenalist constitution system
(about which more below) may be paraphrased in everyday terms, or in
the terms of the realistic language that is customary in the empirical
sciences, or even in the terms of &ldquo;fictitious constructive
operations&rdquo; (which resemble instructions in computer programs:
see III.E in the <em>Aufbau</em>). While such paraphrases of one and
the same constitution-system expression may differ in sense, they
still coincide extensionally, and their extension is pinned down
uniquely by the constitution formula. That is why Carnap regards the
&ldquo;actual language&rdquo; of a constitution system to be the
&ldquo;symbolic language of logic&rdquo; (&sect;96). The point of
assigning different readings to the formulas is merely to
&ldquo;facilitate&rdquo; the &ldquo;comprehension and
examination&rdquo; (&sect;95) of the official logical language of the
constitution system, amounting to a pluralism of choices of how to
interpret and discuss a constitution system (as we would now say)
<em>at the metalevel.</em></p>

<p>
More importantly, the primitive descriptive terms and the definitions
that determine a constitution system may <em>themselves</em> be chosen
in different ways: there is a whole variety of constitution systems
available, each having its own distinctive virtues or shortcomings. We
will first sketch the constitution system actually constructed in the
<em>Aufbau</em>&mdash;the phenomenalist one&mdash;before we turn to
some of the alternative systems that Carnap also mentions.</p>

<p>
The advantage of the phenomenalist constitution system that Carnap
develops in most detail in the <em>Aufbau</em> is supposed to be that
the &ldquo;logical&rdquo; priority relation given by its chains of
definitions reflects the epistemic priority between the defined
concepts and objects (&sect;54): when a relation <i>R</i> is defined
in the system, say, on the basis of <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i>, then this
ought to reflect that <em>recognizing that something is <i>R</i></em>
is based on, or presupposes, <em>recognizing something to be
<i>P</i></em> and <em>recognizing something to be <i>Q</i></em>. For
instance: cultural phenomena, such as the religion of a society, may
be ascertained </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
through the representations, emotions, thoughts, volitions of a
religious sort which occur with the members of this society; also,
documents in the form of writing, pictures, and buildings are
considered. (<em>Aufbau</em>: &sect;55) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That is why psychological and physical objects may be viewed as
epistemically prior to cultural ones. In turn, we can find out about
(&ldquo;<em>hetero</em>-&rdquo;)psychological phenomena (occurring in
<em>other</em> people), such as their emotions, by studying the
physical ways in which they get expressed: by the pitch of a voice,
facial expressions, gestures, and the like (&sect;15). In this sense,
physical objects may be regarded epistemically prior to
(&ldquo;<em>hetero</em>-&rdquo;)psychological ones. Finally, the
properties and relations of physical objects can be determined by
their perceptible indicators, which Carnap takes to be subjective
sensory qualities that one is consciously aware of. But one&rsquo;s
own (&ldquo;auto-psychological&rdquo;) conscious states and processes
may be recognized without having to inspect entities of any other
kind. In this sense, one&rsquo;s own sensory experiences may be
regarded epistemically prior to physical objects. On the logical side,
this hierarchy of epistemic priority relations is reconstructed by the
corresponding hierarchy of definitions in Carnap&rsquo;s phenomenalist
constitution system, which is the reason why Carnap believes the
system to be particularly useful for epistemological purposes
(&sect;54, &sect;59). (Carnap&rsquo;s explicit definition of
&ldquo;auto-psychological&rdquo; qualities from a given phenomenal
similarity relation is described in detail in the supplement on
 <a href="methodology.html#RatiReco">Methodology (Section 3)</a>.
 This belongs to the part of the phenomenalist constitution system
that concerns the definition of &ldquo;auto-psychological&rdquo;
concepts.)</p>

<p>
The choice of an &ldquo;auto-psychological&rdquo; basis still leaves
many different options open. Traditional empiricism, such as that of
Locke or Hume&mdash;and more recently Mach&mdash;had taken as basis
the smallest identifiable element of sense perception, e.g., the
equivalent of a pixel in the field of vision or a specific
sound-quality at a particular pitch heard in a specious present
moment. Instead, Carnap chose the <em>entire</em> experience of a
specious present, prior to any differentiation even into a distinction
between exogenous and endogenous experience, or into separate sense
modalities, as his basic building block. This choice was motivated at
least partly by psychological findings from empirical science. Carnap
interpreted Gestalt psychology (<em>Aufbau</em>: &sect;67) to indicate
that &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; experiences are epistemically prior to
&ldquo;atomic&rdquo; individual sensations (as in traditional
empiricism). Accordingly, the single basic binary relation <i>Er</i>
in his phenomenalist constitution system is a &ldquo;holistic&rdquo;
<em>recollection-of-similarity</em> relation. <i>Er</i> applies to the
basic elements of the system, the so-called elementary experiences
(&ldquo;Elementarerlebnisse&rdquo;), which are temporal slices of
one&rsquo;s <em>total</em> stream of experience, including
<em>all</em> of one&rsquo;s conscious experiences at one extended
subjective &ldquo;specious present&rdquo;, whether these experiences
relate to some sensory modality (e.g., the experience of the
left-upper corner of one&rsquo;s visual field to be dark-blue) or some
kind of inner experience, such as, e.g., a feeling. The basic
predicate &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo; is meant to apply to elementary
experiences <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> (that is, \(x \Er y)\), if and only
if the subject of the experiences recollects <i>x</i> to be similar to
<i>y</i> in some respect. What this means exactly is a bit tricky, but
the point is that there is both a temporal and a qualitative aspect to
<i>Er</i>: on the one hand, <i>x</i> <em>took place before</em>
<i>y</i>, and on the other hand, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are
<em>qualitatively similar-in-part</em>: e.g., <i>x</i> might involve
the experience of the left-upper corner of one&rsquo;s visual field to
be dark blue; and (the later) <i>y</i> includes the experience of the
left-middle corner of one&rsquo;s visual field to be light blue (and
hence the experience of a similar color at a similar place). Other
than visual sensations, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> might also have
something else in common, e.g., they might include similar auditory or
tactile sensations as their parts, or similar emotions.</p>

<p>
It is important to be clear about the language levels that are
involved here (see section 9 of Leitgeb 2007): any such explanation of
the intended interpretation of &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo; must be
formulated on a metalevel relative to the (object) language of the
constitution system. Within the constitution system itself, however,
&lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo; is a primitive term that is not defined or
explained at all. A similar distinction applies when one says that
elementary experiences are similar &ldquo;in part&rdquo; or that they
are &ldquo;one&rsquo;s&rdquo; or &ldquo;my&rdquo; experiences: <em>in
the constitution system</em>, terms for parts of elementary
experiences and for the subject of experience are to be defined on the
basis of &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo;, at some level high up in the
constitution system. But within the <em>metalanguage</em>, these terms
may be assumed to be understood already (if only imprecisely) and may
therefore be used as a guide to the meaning of &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo;
as described on the metalevel. While the Carnap of the <em>Aufbau</em>
does not yet possess the Tarskian apparatus of formally distinguishing
object language from metalanguage, he clarifies and explains the
corresponding language levels rather carefully throughout the
<em>Aufbau</em>: e.g., in &sect;108, his presentation of the relation
<i>Er</i> as basic (primitive) in his phenomenalist constitution
system is clearly distinguished from his informal paraphrases of
<i>Er</i> in which <i>Er</i> is explained on the basis of other terms
(in realistic language or in the language of &ldquo;fictitious
constructive operations&rdquo;). And in &sect;75&ndash;81 he
distinguishes between terms as understood in the constitution system
and terms as used in informal explanations by a simple synactic
device: the former terms are enclosed by two occurrences of
&lsquo;K&rsquo; for &lsquo;<i>K</i>onstitutionsystem&rsquo; whereas
the latter terms are enclosed by occurrences of &lsquo;P&rsquo; for
&lsquo;language of <i>p</i>sychology&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Although Part IV of the <em>Aufbau</em> focuses on this phenomenalist
constitution system, Carnap emphasizes the existence of a great
variety of alternative ways of building constitution systems: as the
title of Part IV of the <em>Aufbau</em> expresses, it is merely an
&ldquo;Outline of <i>a</i> Constitutional System&rdquo; (our
emphasis); it is nowhere suggested that the phenomenalist constitution
system is &ldquo;the best&rdquo; or &ldquo;most natural&rdquo; such
system for all purposes whatever&mdash;let alone &ldquo;the
true&rdquo; system, as suggested by Quine&rsquo;s interpretation of
the <em>Aufbau</em>. Even as far as matters of epistemic priority are
concerned, Carnap acknowledges that other paths of recognition or
ascertainment are available that could be reconstructed by means of
alternative chains of definition; e.g., even one&rsquo;s <em>own</em>
inner states might be determined from their bodily expressions, or,
once neuroscience will have progressed sufficiently, they might be
detected through the brain processes that accompany them (&sect;57).
If the paths of definitions were adjusted accordingly, the resulting
constitution systems might serve epistemological purposes just as well
as, or even better than, the phenomenalist constitution system of the
<em>Aufbau.</em></p>

<p>
What is more, one might construct constitution systems for completely
<em>different purposes</em> than those of epistemology, e.g., with the
goal of maximizing the convenience and simplicity by which empirical
laws can be reconstructed in precise terms in the system. If that is
the goal, a &ldquo;system with a physical basis constitutes a more
appropriate arrangement of concepts than any other&rdquo; (&sect;59).
Carnap suggests that the basis of such a physicalist system might
consist, e.g., of subatomic particles as basic objects, and their
spatial and temporal relations as basic relations (nor does he require
any observability conditions of such a physicalist basis). Or,
alternatively, space-time points of the four-dimensional space-time
continuum might serve as basic objects, and their relative positions
in the continuum, augmented by certain physical relations between real
numbers and space-time points, as basic relations (&sect;62); and so
forth.</p>

<p>
The claim that multiple basic elements and relations, and multiple
systems of definitions, are available from which one may choose freely
for different purposes is clearly a predecessor of Carnap&rsquo;s
later principle of tolerance in the <em>Logical Syntax</em> (see
supplement on
 <a href="tolerance-metaphysics.html#ToleLogiSynt">Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology (Section 1)</a>).
 This said, Carnap soon realized that the &ldquo;tolerance&rdquo; of
the <em>Aufbau</em> did not go far enough: on the one hand,
restricting the methods of concept formation to that of
<em>definition</em> turned out to be overly restrictive. (See
 <a href="#QuinCritConsSpacLimiDefi">section 4</a>
 below; later critiques and responses to this problem are discussed in
the supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories</a>.)
 On the other hand, tolerance does not as yet extend to <em>logic</em>
itself (as it later would in the <em>Logical Syntax</em>), as one and
the same logical system of simple type theory is used for all of the
constitution systems discussed in the <em>Aufbau</em>. Finally,
neither the constitution systems nor their metalinguistic discussion
is constructed formally, as the languages in <em>Syntax</em> would
later be. For Carnap&rsquo;s own later purposes and by his own later
standards, therefore, the procedures of concept formation in the
<em>Aufbau</em> are not yet precise enough.</p>

<h3 id="StruAufb">2. Structuralism in the <em>Aufbau</em></h3>

<p>
Since Carnap&rsquo;s central example of a constitution system in the
<em>Aufbau</em> is a phenomenalist one with a subjective basis, the
obvious question arises whether it is feasible on that basis to
constitute the objects and concepts of the <em>objective</em> or
<em>intersubjective</em> world of science, and especially of the
physical world&mdash;a world presumed to be (at least approximately)
the same for all of us. The reason why Carnap thinks this is possible
is that he regards science as dealing only with the <em>structure</em>
of objects (&sect;&sect;10&ndash;16): with their <em>form</em>, not
their &ldquo;content&rdquo;. That is why it should be possible, he
says, to reconstruct scientific statements as <em>structural
statements</em> (dealing with the structure of subjective experience
in the phenomenalist constitution system, the structure of physical
entities in a physicalist constitution system, and so on). Even when
their content is ultimately subjective, as it is in a phenomenalist
constitution system, their special logical form would still leave
these structural statements with the required scientific
objectivity.</p>

<p>
But what exactly is a &ldquo;structural statement&rdquo;? With a
reference to Poincar&eacute; (&sect;16), Carnap suggests that not
sensations themselves but only the relations between sensations can be
regarded as objective (and in &sect;7 he claims that in a constitution
system the system of basic relations is, in a sense, prior to the
basic elements). Moreover, in the course of scientific development,
predicates for properties (such as <i>x</i> <em>is blue</em>) became
definable or reconstructible in terms of <em>relations</em> that can
be expressed in mathematical terms (such as <i>x</i> <em>emits a light
wave that has a rate of oscillation of</em>&hellip;, &sect;10).
Indeed, in the meantime, &ldquo;almost all physical concepts have been
transformed into purely structural concepts&rdquo;. This paraphrases
the more detailed discussion of the progression from qualitative to
comparative to quantitative scientific concepts in <em>Physical
Concept Formation</em> (Carnap 1926), which remains unchanged a
quarter century later in &sect;&sect;4&ndash;5 of Chapter 1 of the
<em>Logical Foundations of Probability</em> in the context of the
explication of concepts (see the supplement on
 <a href="methodology.html#Expl">Methodology (Section 1)</a>).
 Carnaps says about mathematical and physical concepts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
All mathematical concepts are reducible to concepts which stem from
the theory of relations: four-dimensional tensor and vector fields are
structural schemata; the network of world lines with the relations of
coincidence and local time order is a structural schema in which only
two relations are still names; and even these are uniquely determined
through the character of the schema. (<em>Aufbau</em>, &sect;16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But replacing predicates for properties by predicates for relations is
just the first step in making a statement
&ldquo;structural&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
From the relations, we must go on to the structures of relations if we
want to reach completely formalized entities. Relations themselves are
not intersubjectively communicable in their qualitative peculiarity.
It was not until Russell [<em>Introduction to Mathematical
Philosophy</em>] that the importance of structure for the achievement
of objectivity was pointed out. (<em>Aufbau</em>, &sect;16)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So the next step is to replace predicates for relations by yet more
structural descriptions of the <em>formal higher-order properties of
these relations</em> (e.g., a relation <i>R</i> being
<em>reflexive</em>, <em>symmetric</em>, and <em>transitive</em>).
Finally, such formal higher-order properties can be expressed with the
help of <em>logical terms</em> (e.g.: (i) <i>R</i> is reflexive: for
all <i>x</i>, \(x R x\). (ii) <i>R</i> is symmetric: for all <i>x</i>,
<i>y</i>, if \(x R y\) then \(y R x\). (iii) <i>R</i> is transitive:
for all <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, if \(x R y\) and \(y R z\), then
\(x R z)\). (Here and in what follows, we replace Carnap&rsquo;s own
symbols in the <em>Aufbau</em> by modern ones, for the sake of
readability.) The idea is that ultimately <em>every</em> scientific
predicate may be reconstructed by means of such logical descriptions
of structural higher-order properties of relations&mdash;properties
that are invariant under isomorphisms (one-to-one and onto
structure-preserving mappings of the domain of the relation <i>R</i>;
accordingly, <em>the</em> structure of a relation <i>R</i> can be
defined as the class of relation extensions that are isomorphic to
<i>R</i>; &sect;34). In this way, science heads towards
&ldquo;formalization and dematerialization&rdquo; (&sect;23), and
&ldquo;each scientific statement can in principle be so transformed
that it is nothing but a structure statement&rdquo; (&sect;16). (As we
explain in the supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#Crit">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 5)</a>,
 his preferred mature reconstructions of science also involve a
detailed reconstruction of the structural content of sentences and
theories, but only with respect to <em>theoretical</em> terms rather
than observational terms, and on a strictly <em>physicalistic</em>
basis.)</p>

<p>
Carnap illustrates this idea, which he regards as closely related to
Hilbert&rsquo;s (1899) famous &ldquo;implicit definitions&rdquo; of
geometric terms, by his example of a schematic railway map:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Let us look at the railroad map of, say, the Eurasian railroad
network&hellip; It does not represent the distances, but only the
connections within the network; (to use the terminology of geometry)
it indicates only the topological, not the metrical, properties of the
network&hellip; We assume now that all stations are marked as points,
but the map is not to contain any names nor any entries other than
rail lines. The question now is: can we determine the names of the
points on the map through an inspection of the actual railroad
network? &hellip; we look up the intersections of highest order, i.e.,
those in which the largest number of lines meet. We will find only a
small number of these. Assume that we find twenty intersections in
which eight lines meet. We then count, for each such point, the number
of stations between it and the next intersection on each of the eight
lines, and we will hardly find two of the eight to coincide in all
eight numbers. Thus we have identified all twenty points. But if there
are still two, or even all twenty, which have the same numbers, then
all we have to do is to consider the connections between each of the
eight neighboring intersections: whether or not they have direct
connections, how many stations there are between them, how many lines
meet in these neighboring connections, etc. But what happens if there
are two intersections for which we cannot find any difference even
after surveying the entire system? This simply means that there are
two points with identical structural characteristics (homotopic
points) as far as the relation to neighboring railroad stations is
concerned. [&hellip;] If there should still be two locations for which
we have found no difference even after exhausting all available
scientific relations, then they are indistinguishable, not only for
geography, but for science in general. They may be subjectively
different: I could be in one of these locations, but not in the other.
But this would not amount to an objective difference, since there
would be in the other place a man just like myself who says, as I do:
I am here and not there. (<em>Aufbau</em>, &sect;14)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Within the phenomenalist constitution system in the <em>Aufbau</em>,
Carnap aims to realize this idea by defining concepts in
logical-structural terms. For example: from the given relation
<i>Er</i> of resemblance collection, he defines the class <em>erl</em>
of elementary experiences as the field of \(\Er(\erl = \{x \mid
\exists y: x \Er y\} \cup \{y \mid \exists x: x \Er y\}).\) Then he
defines the relation <i>Ae</i> of qualitative phenomenal similarity as
the reflexive transitive closure of <i>Er</i> (the least reflexive and
transitive relation of elementary experiences that is a superset of
<i>Er</i>). This being in place, he defines the class of what he calls
<em>similarity circles</em>; a similarity circle is a maximal class of
elementary experiences all members of which stand in the <i>Ae</i>
relation. This is an application of Carnap&rsquo;s logical abstraction
method of quasianalysis, which we explain in detail in the supplement
on
 <a href="methodology.html#RatiReco">Methodology (Section 3)</a>.
 The idea is that, while elementary experiences are unanalyzable into
components in the phenomenalist constitution system, as they
constitute the <em>basic</em> (primitive) <em>elements</em> of the
system, it is still possible to define logical reconstructions of
&ldquo;component talk&rdquo; in the system by exploiting the
<em>relations</em> in which elementary experiences stand to each
other. (Hence this is <em>quasi</em>analysis; see &sect;68&ndash;69.)
Similarity circles serve as the logical reconstructions of extended
qualities that, in informal talk, are said to be exemplified by
elementary experiences (e.g., such qualities may correspond to regions
in color space, such as the region for <em>red</em>). Carnap uses
another variant of quasianalysis to define the so-called
&ldquo;quality classes&rdquo;, which logically reconstruct pointwise
phenomenal qualities (e.g., points in color space, such as a
particular <em>red tone</em>), and a similarity relation <i>Aq</i> on
these quality classes. The transitive closure of <i>Aq</i> (the least
transitive relation of quality classes that is a superset of
<i>Aq</i>) may then be seen to be an equivalence relation, from which
equivalence classes can be determined just as usual in mathematics.
Carnap argues that these equivalence classes reconstruct <em>sense
classes</em> (<em>visual</em>, <em>auditory</em>,
<em>tactile</em>,&hellip;). In order to identify which of the
equivalence classes of the transitive closure of <i>Aq</i> corresponds
to which sense class&mdash;the system does not &ldquo;know&rdquo; this
as yet, since <i>Aq</i> had not been tied to any sensory modality in
particular&mdash;Carnap considers the structural properties of sense
classes: in particular, he proposes to determine the topological
<em>dimension</em> of <i>Aq</i> on any such sense class when <i>Aq</i>
is viewed as a neighborhood relation on its quality classes. For
instance, Carnap claims (on empirical grounds) that the all-important
visual sense class can be singled out as the only one that is
<em>five-dimensional</em> (&sect;86): two dimensions relating to the
place in the visual field, and three dimensions for the hue,
saturation, and brightness of the color at a place. Hence,
<em>gesicht</em> (&ldquo;<em>sight</em>&rdquo;, the visual sense
class) can be defined as the set of quality classes that are members
of <em>the sense class of dimension 5</em> (&sect;115)&mdash;a
definition that can formalized by expressing topological
dimensionality in terms of <i>Aq</i> and logical symbols. This
constitutes a typical instance of what is called a &ldquo;structural
definite description&rdquo; in the <em>Aufbau</em>. (Unfortunately, as
noted by Goodman (1951: chapter X), Carnap&rsquo;s method of
identifying the visual sense class by its dimension does not actually
work. The reason is that the standard definition of topological
dimension presupposed by Carnap assigns to any <em>finite</em>
topological space a dimension of 0. Thus, if the underlying set of
basic elements is finite, as Carnap assumes, <em>gesicht</em> will
also have a dimension of 0&mdash;which no longer distinguishes it from
the other sense classes; see Schoch (2001) for further details. As
Leitgeb (2011) shows, by invoking a different notion of dimensionality
combined with an alternative phenomenalist basis, this problem can be
solved.)</p>

<p>
In some sense, however, one might think that structural descriptions
such as that of the visual sense class are still not structural
enough: after all, they are based on definitions such as</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>gesicht</em> \(= \{x | x\) <em>is a quality class and</em>
&hellip;<i>x</i>&hellip;\(\}\)</p>
</div>

<p>
in which the clause &ldquo;<em><i>x</i> is a quality class and
&hellip;x</em>&hellip;&rdquo; reduces ultimately not only to logical
symbols and the variable &ldquo;<i>x</i>&rdquo;, but also (after
unpacking all defined expressions by their defining terms) the
primitive predicate &ldquo;<i>Er</i>&rdquo;, which is the sole
<em>descriptive</em> member of the vocabulary of Carnap&rsquo;s
phenomalist constitution system. To turn this into a
<em>completely</em> structural description of the visual sense class,
it seems, this remaining descriptive component would have to be
eliminated in favor of <em>purely logical</em> expressions.</p>

<p>
Indeed, the very last part of Carnap&rsquo;s discussion of the
phenomenalist system (<em>Aufbau</em>: &sect;&sect;153&ndash;155),
which he says the reader &ldquo;may skip&rdquo;, is devoted to an
attempt to define even the basic relation <i>Er</i> just by means of
<em>logical</em> concepts. (In the resulting constitution system,
which would not coincide with the original phenomenalist system
anymore, &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo; would no longer count as primitive,
and every sentence in which &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo; had been the only
descriptive term could now be transformed into a purely logical
statement.)</p>

<p>
Carnap suggests that this might be achieved in two steps: first, he
singles out some &ldquo;sufficiently high-level empirical theorem
about <i>Er</i>&rdquo; (&sect;155); let us call that statement:
<i>Th</i>[<i>Er</i>]. For instance, <i>Th</i>[<i>Er</i>] might express
the three-dimensionality of the color solid (disregarding locations
now), as formulated previously by means of &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo; and
logical symbols. Secondly, &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo; might be defined to
be one of the binary relations <i>R</i> that satisfy the open formula
<i>Th</i>[<i>R</i>] (in which the second-order variable
&lsquo;<i>R</i>&rsquo; replaces &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo;). But which
one? (Assuming the existence of such an <i>R</i> has been
established.) Carnap is well aware of the existence of relations
\(\Er'\) that are isomorphic to <i>Er</i>&mdash;and hence satisfy
<i>Th</i>[<i>R</i>] just in case <i>Er</i> does&mdash;without being
extensionally identical to <i>Er</i>. Such alternative relations
\(\Er'\) may even be definable in terms of permutations of elementary
experiences, as Carnap points out in &sect;154. His remedy for such
(in the modern terminology) isomorphic but still &ldquo;non-intended
models&rdquo; is to extend the purely logical vocabulary of simple
type theory by the new term &lsquo;<em>fund</em>&rsquo; (for
&ldquo;fundiert&rdquo;, founded), such that <em>fund</em>(<i>R</i>) is
supposed to express that <i>R</i> corresponds to an
&ldquo;experienceable, &lsquo;natural&rsquo;&rdquo; relation: pairs of
elementary experiences that belong to the extension of any such
<em>founded</em> <i>R</i> &ldquo;have something in common that can be
experienced&rdquo; (&sect;154). So, if &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo; is
finally defined by means of another, supposedly, structural definite
description of the form</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<i>Er</i> = the binary relation <i>R</i>, such that
<em>fund</em>(<i>R</i>) and <i>Th</i>[<i>R</i>],</p>
</div>

<p>
and if it holds that there is one and only one <i>R</i> such that
<em>fund</em>(<i>R</i>) and <i>Th</i>[<i>R</i>] are the case, then, by
the intended interpretation of &lsquo;<em>fund</em>&rsquo;,
<em>the</em> &ldquo;right&rdquo; relation of elementary experiences
would be assigned to &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo;. (As mentioned in the
supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 4)</a>,
 this anticipates D. Lewis&rsquo;s (1970) method of defining
theoretical terms.) If, finally, &lsquo;<em>fund</em>&rsquo; can be
shown to be a <em>logical</em> term, the resulting constitution system
would only involve primitive terms that are logical, and every
scientific statement expressible in the original phenomenalist
constitution system based on &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo; could now be
reformulated in <em>perfectly structural</em> terms. The language of
empirical science could ultimately dispense with primitive terms the
meaning of which would be given non-structurally (e.g., by
acquaintance or ostension) and hence subjectively.</p>

<p>
This not only sounds, but unfortunately is, incredible. The idea will
only work if the crucial condition is met that Carnap&rsquo;s new
primitive term &lsquo;<em>fund</em>&rsquo; can be regarded as
logical&mdash;for which Carnap in fact gives no argument other than
pointing to the &ldquo;generality&rdquo; of the term (<em>Aufbau</em>:
&sect;158). Indeed, &lsquo;<em>fund</em>&rsquo; would <em>not</em>
count as logical according to Tarski&rsquo;s later (1986) invariance
criterion precisely because &lsquo;<em>fund</em>&rsquo; is not
isomorphism-invariant (see the discussion in teh suppplement
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#StruCarnMatuTheoReco">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 6)</a>),
 and no one in the more recent literature on logical concepts would
regard anything like <em>fund</em> as logical. The reason Carnap
thought the relevant paragraphs of the <em>Aufbau</em> &ldquo;may be
omitted&rdquo; was probably that he recognized the severity of the
problem. In a nutshell: &sect;&sect;153&ndash;155 of the
<em>Aufbau</em> fail, since structural descriptions in reconstructions
of empirical science <em>cannot</em> be formulated <em>solely</em> by
means of logical terms. But that was a rather paradoxical goal,
anyway, since empirical science is, after all, empirical. What the
failure of &sect;&sect;153&ndash;5 does <em>not</em> mean is that the
method or aim of reconstructing scientific statements as structural
descriptions <em>that involve primitive empirical terms</em> (such as
&lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo;) is undermined. Within the phenomenalist
system of the <em>Aufbau</em>, higher-order logical descriptions
involving &lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo; may still describe the structure of
a subject&rsquo;s experience, based on definitions (such as of the
visual sense class) that will be applicable to a broad (though not
unconstrained) range of subjects having different though structurally
analogous experiences. Reconstructing scientific concepts in ever more
structural terms makes these concepts ever more subject-invariant.
What the failure of &sect;&sect;153&ndash;5 shows, from the modern
point of view, is merely that there cannot be a &ldquo;maximally
structural&rdquo; logical definition of these concepts at the
apparently natural limit of this ever increasing degree of invariance.
</p>

<h3 id="ReceLateDiscAufb">3. Reception and Later Discussion of the <em>Aufbau</em></h3>

<p>
The book was widely discussed among philosophers and became, along
with Wittgenstein&rsquo;s <em>Tractatus</em>, one of the main
reference points for the Vienna Circle&rsquo;s brand of philosophy,
which Neurath wanted to call &ldquo;logical positivism&rdquo;, while
Carnap (among others) preferred &ldquo;logical empiricism&rdquo;. The
first book-length treatment and critique of the <em>Aufbau</em> was
Eino Kaila&rsquo;s 1930 <em>Der logische Neopositivismus</em>, based
not only on a detailed reading of the text but also on extensive
conversations with Carnap during Kaila&rsquo;s visit to Vienna in
1929. Kaila&rsquo;s critique is very much along the realistic lines
that would later be spelled out at greater length by Reichenbach in
<em>Experience and Prediction</em> (1938), who however hardly mentions
Carnap or the <em>Aufbau</em> by name, preferring to criticize unnamed
&ldquo;positivists&rdquo;. Kaila&rsquo;s critique has two main parts.
First, he devotes a great deal of time to Carnap&rsquo;s
constitutional definitions, claiming by various arguments that they
are phenomenologically inadequate and that extensional reconstructions
of them (even of the concept of &ldquo;ordered pair&rdquo; in
mathematics) are impossible. Second, he claimed that the
<em>practice</em> of science requires assumptions that Carnap either
denied or could not account for within the <em>Aufbau</em> system.
Here Kaila follows Reichenbach quite closely in his then recent
&ldquo;Goals and paths of physical knowledge [<em>Ziele und Wege der
physikalischen Erkenntnis</em>]&rdquo; (Reichenbach 1929), stressing
especially the importance of probability in science, and its absence
in the <em>Aufbau</em>. Though Kaila&rsquo;s critique was not widely
discussed outside of Vienna, Carnap took it very seriously indeed. He
not only reviewed Kaila&rsquo;s book, quite generously (Carnap 1930d),
but also worked for a year or so on a paper responding to
Kaila&rsquo;s second criticism, which he provisionally called
&ldquo;The constitution of the non-given&rdquo; [&ldquo;Die
Konstitution des Nicht-Gegebenen&rdquo;] (Carnap 1930e, summarized and
discussed by Carus 2007a, Ch. 7-8; see also Neuber 2018: Ch. 9). </p>

<p>
A.J. Ayer&rsquo;s <em>Language, Truth, and Logic</em> (1936) may have
implicitly been included (though it was not cited) in
Reichenbach&rsquo;s 1938 critique of &ldquo;positivists&rdquo;.
Certainly to anyone outside the immediate environs of the Vienna
Circle, Ayer&rsquo;s book was by far the most popular and accessible
account of the <em>Aufbau</em>&rsquo;s main ideas, and certainly
contributed to Carnap&rsquo;s celebrity in the English-speaking world.
However, Ayer&rsquo;s treatment, combined with the unavailability of
the actual <em>Aufbau</em> in English until 1967, was also largely
responsible for many of the fundamental misunderstandings of the book
that persisted for most of the twentieth century. (Even in this
century, they have not been entirely expunged; it was still possible
as recently as 2003 for a respected history of analytic philosophy to
use Ayer as the main representative of &ldquo;logical
positivism&rdquo; (Soames 2003).)</p>

<p>
Unmoved by such misunderstandings, but prone to subtler ones, were a
few of Carnap&rsquo;s immediate acquaintances. Quine took the
<em>Aufbau</em> as his prime example of the &ldquo;second dogma&rdquo;
(of reductionism) he criticized in his famous paper attacking Carnap
(Quine 1951); see the supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#QuinCritCarnReduVeriTheoMean">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 1)</a>.
 In that same paper, Quine also drew attention to a flaw in
Carnap&rsquo;s construction of three-dimensional space from the
two-dimensional visual field in &sect;&sect;125&ndash;6 of the
<em>Aufbau</em>: see
 <a href="#QuinCritConsSpacLimiDefi">section 4</a>
 below. A much more detailed and comprehensive account of the
<em>Aufbau</em> was given in the same year by Nelson Goodman&rsquo;s
book <em>The Structure of Appearance</em>. This was perhaps the first
time the book was taken seriously in its own terms, and certainly the
first engagement with its technical infrastructure. Goodman advanced
most of the more specific arguments against Carnap&rsquo;s
constitution system that are still taken to be decisive: they concern
quasianalysis, that is, the logical method of abstraction Carnap
applies in the <em>Aufbau</em>; see supplement on
 <a href="methodology.html#RatiReco">Methodology (Section 3)</a>
 for details.</p>

<p>
By the time the <em>Aufbau</em> finally appeared in English in 1967,
it was no longer considered of much importance, and was hardly
attended to. It took another two decades before a revaluation set in,
launched by Michael Friedman in a series of papers beginning in 1987,
and later collected in his book <em>Reconsidering Logical
Positivism</em> (1999). Friedman took issue with the entire
English-speaking tradition, dating back to Ayer, of interpreting the
<em>Aufbau</em> as pursuing mainly a phenomenalist program of reducing
all knowledge to sense-impressions on the model of Hume or Mach.
Instead, Friedman pointed out, we have to take seriously the early
Carnap&rsquo;s emergence from the neo-Kantian schools of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, especially the Marburg
school and its then-foremost representatives Paul Natorp and Ernst
Cassirer. Seen in this context, the book may be better understood as
seeking a new basis for scientific objectivity; Friedman was able to
point, for instance, to the strong emphasis in Carnap&rsquo;s text on
the achievement of objective knowledge despite the subjective starting
point of individual perception, and the frequent invocation of
structuralism (the heavy use of &ldquo;purely structural direct
descriptions&rdquo;) and structuralist metaphors such as that of the
railway map in &sect;14, and the theme enunciated in the title of
&sect;16: &ldquo;All scientific statements are structural
statements&rdquo;. (Carnap&rsquo;s structuralism in the
<em>Aufbau</em> is discussed in
 <a href="#StruAufb">section 2</a>
 above.)</p>

<p>
Friedman&rsquo;s re-interpretation was elaborated not only by himself
but by others (e.g., Richardson 1998) and variously incorporated into
a range of hybrid views that attempt to do justice to the Russellian
as well as the neo-Kantian and phenomenological contexts of
Carnap&rsquo;s work during the 1920s (Mormann 2000; Pincock 2005,
2009; Carus 2007a, 2016). A number of other influences are also being
excavated; a good example is the collection of papers on the
<em>Aufbau</em> edited by Christian Damb&ouml;ck (2016).</p>

<p>
This interpretative reconstruction of Carnap&rsquo;s philosophical
aims and contexts has also given rise to a new focus on the
reconstruction of the <em>Aufbau</em>&rsquo;s constitution system.
Recent discussions of the method of quasianalysis (Mormann 1994, 1997,
2009; Leitgeb 2007) pick up the thread of the 1951 critique by Goodman
and explore strategies for blunting those critiques (see supplement on
 <a href="methodology.html#RatiReco">Methodology (Section 3)</a>).
 Building on this, Leitgeb (2011) has gone further and argued that
once the goal of Carnap&rsquo;s constitution system is limited to the
preservation of empirical content, all of Goodman&rsquo;s <em>and</em>
Quine&rsquo;s (1951) objections (discussed in
 <a href="#QuinCritConsSpacLimiDefi">section 4</a>
 below and the supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#QuinCritCarnReduVeriTheoMean">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 1)</a>)
 can be avoided.</p>

<p>
All the discussion of the <em>Aufbau</em> cited here up to this point
is either interpretative work based directly on the text, or takes
Carnap&rsquo;s own framework and aims as its starting point. But there
are also wider-ranging emulations of the <em>Aufbau</em> that leave
aside Carnap&rsquo;s own aims but still share the ambition of building
some larger or even all-encompassing conceptual system on ta simpler
basis. (The best-known example in recent years is <em>Constructing the
World</em> by David J. Chalmers (2012); see supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="QuinCritConsSpacLimiDefi">4. Quine&rsquo;s Critique of the Construction of Space and the Limits of Definition</h3>

<p>
It turned out that there were at least two major problems with
Carnap&rsquo;s proposal that all scientific terms are definable from
the basic elements and basic properties and relations as described in
 <a href="#ConsSyst">section 1</a>
 above. One of these problems was pointed out by Quine in &ldquo;Two
Dogmas of Empiricism&rdquo; (concerning the &ldquo;dogma&rdquo; of
radical reductionism), the other (concerning disposition terms) was
diagnosed by Carnap himself in <em>Testability and Meaning</em>. We
will only deal here with Quine&rsquo;s (1951) criticism of
Carnap&rsquo;s attempt of defining three-dimensional space from the
two-dimensional visual field in the <em>Aufbau</em>. For more on
Quine&rsquo;s more general criticism of Carnap&rsquo;s
&ldquo;radical&rdquo; reductionism in the <em>Aufbau</em>, and of the
later Carnap&rsquo;s alleged &ldquo;non-radical&rdquo; reductionism,
see supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#QuinCritCarnReduVeriTheoMean">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 1)&rdquo;</a>.
 Carnap&rsquo;s own insight that disposition terms cannot be
reconstructed by explicit definitions on the basis of observation
terms alone, which is why they require a more flexible method of
concept reconstruction, is discussed in the supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#DispTermTestMean">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 2)</a>.
 (In addition to these two well-known major problems, there are
others, e.g., that the <em>Aufbau</em> does not include explicit
definitions of <em>probabilistic</em> scientific terms either; again,
Carnap later corrected this deficiency. His later treatment of
probability is the topic of the supplement on
 <a href="inductive-logic.html">Inductive Logic</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
Carnap&rsquo;s thought in IV.B of the <em>Aufbau</em> is the
projection of one&rsquo;s temporally ordered subjective color
sensations, which would make up the two-dimensional order of
one&rsquo;s visual field at any point in time (the relevant concepts
of which he had already defined at that point), into four-dimensional,
purely mathematical Euclidean spacetime. That is to be done in such a
way that twelve desiderata are satisfied which Carnap enumerates in
&sect;&sect;126&ndash;127. Essentially (cf. Leitgeb 2011: 278), they
amount to the following: (D1) there should be a continuous curve
comprising the subject&rsquo;s points of sight in spacetime; (D2) from
these points of sight, phenomenal color qualities are to be projected
into spacetime along straight lines of sight, such that subjective
temporal order and the neighborhood relation between visual sensations
are respected; (D3) the color qualities themselves are meant to
&ldquo;travel&rdquo; on segments of continuous world-lines through
spacetime; and (D4) certain maxims of continuity are to be satisfied,
e.g.: colors on world-lines ought to change as slowly as possible; the
curvature of their world-lines should be as small as possible; the
colors should move along world-lines as slowly as possible;
world-lines should preserve their spatial distances as much as
possible; and the like. (In order to fulfill these desiderata of
continuity and inertness, it might be necessary to &ldquo;fill
in&rdquo; colors of &ldquo;unseen&rdquo; points, as Carnap notes
explicitly.)</p>

<p>
Based on the resulting assignment, say, <em>col</em>, of colors to
&ldquo;world points&rdquo;, Carnap sketches definitions of concepts
such as: <em>visual thing</em> (classes of proximate spacetime points
the colors of which are sufficiently stable in time); <em>my body</em>
(a special visual thing close to one&rsquo;s point of view with some
distinctive properties, e.g., it being touched by something
correlating with one&rsquo;s tactile sensations); an expansion of the
domain of <em>my consciousness</em> (as constructed in prior steps) to
that of the <em>complete auto-psychological domain</em> that also
includes unconscious objects and states; and <em>perceptual
things</em> (things having various sense qualities simultaneously:
visual, tactile, taste,&hellip;). The emerging &ldquo;perceptual
world&rdquo; is to be completed by some principles of
&ldquo;analogy&rdquo; (a postulate of causality and a postulate of
substance, &sect;135). This being set up, the final step into the
&ldquo;world of physics&rdquo; should be taken, first, by changing the
Euclidean metric of perceptual space into a non-Euclidean metric, as
demanded by the general theory of relativity, and, secondly, by
replacing the color qualities that are mapped by <em>col</em> into
spacetime by certain numerical physical-state magnitudes that would
stand to these qualities in &ldquo;physico-qualitative
correlation&rdquo; (&sect;136).</p>

<p>
Quine (1951) addressed this part of Carnap&rsquo;s phenomenalist
constitution system in a well-known criticism along the following
lines:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In a series of constructions in which he exploits the resources of
modern logic with much ingenuity, Carnap succeeds in defining a wide
array of important additional sensory concepts which, but for his
constructions, one would not have dreamed were definable on so slender
a basis. Carnap was the first empiricist who, not content with
asserting the reducibility of science to terms encoding immediate
experience, took serious steps toward carrying out the reduction. But
even supposing Carnap&rsquo;s starting point to be satisfactory, his
constructions were, as he himself stressed, only a fragment of the
full program. The construction of even the simplest statements about
the physical world was left in a sketchy state. However briefly hinted
at, though, Carnap&rsquo;s ideas on this subject are very suggestive.
He explained spatio-temporal point-instants as quadruples of real
numbers and envisaged assignment of sense qualities to point-instants
according to certain canons. Roughly summarized, the plan was that
qualities should be assigned to point-instants in such a way as to
achieve the laziest world compatible with our experience. The
principle of least action was to be our guide in constructing a world
from experience.</p>

<p>
Carnap did not seem to recognize, however, that his treatment of
physical objects fell short of reduction not merely through
sketchiness, but in principle. Statements of the form &ldquo;Quality
<i>q</i> is at point-instant <i>x</i>; <i>y</i>; <i>z</i>;
<i>t</i>&rdquo; were, according to his canons, to be apportioned truth
values in such a way as to maximize and minimize certain over-all
features, and with growth of experience the truth values were to be
progressively revised in the same spirit. We consider this a good
schematization (deliberately oversimplified, to be sure) of what
science really does. But it provides no indication, not even the
sketchiest, of how a statement of the form &ldquo;Quality <i>q</i> is
at point-instant <i>x</i>; <i>y</i>; <i>z</i>; <i>t</i>&rdquo; could
ever be translated into Carnap&rsquo;s initial language of sense data
and logic. The connective &ldquo;is at&rdquo; remains an added
undefined connective; the canons counsel us in its use but not in its
elimination. (Quine 1951: 37f)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As Quine rightly observes, Carnap had not delivered in Chapter IV.B of
the <em>Aufbau</em> what he had promised before: to state
<em>definitions</em> of all non-primitive terms, such as for the color
assignment function symbol. Instead, Carnap merely lays down (sketches
of) <em>postulates</em> for what a color assignment function ought to
be like, which leaves completely unclear how an occurrence of the
color assignment term could be eliminated in favor of the primitive
terms of the constitution system.</p>

<p>
How problematic is this from the modern point of view? Maybe not as
problematic as it seemed to Quine (cf. Leitgeb 2011: Section 5). In
Carnap&rsquo;s later terms, what is going on here is that, relative to
the meager phenomenalist basis of Carnap&rsquo;s system, the intended
assignment <em>col</em> of colors to points in spacetime is expressed
by a <em>theoretical term</em> that might still be rationally
reconstructed in ways Carnap himself supplied in the <em>Aufbau</em>
itself and afterwards. For instance, in &sect;&sect;153&ndash;155 of
the <em>Aufbau</em>, Carnap considers defining the basic predicate
&lsquo;<i>Er</i>&rsquo; of his phenomenalist system on the basis of
yet more fundamental terms by means of an equality statement that
takes a definite description on its right-hand side:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<i>Er</i> = the binary relation <i>R</i>, such that&hellip; [fill in
constraint on <i>R</i>]</p>
</div>

<p>
(See
 <a href="#StruAufb">section 2</a>
 above for the details on this step.) Carnap could have applied the
same strategy in the step in which he aims to construct physical space
by defining the required color assignment mapping by means of:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<em>col</em> = the function <i>f</i>, such that&hellip; [fill in
Carnap&rsquo;s postulates for <i>f</i>].</p>
</div>

<p>
In fact, that would have been the method by which more than several
decades later David Lewis (1970) suggested defining theoretical terms
in general; it is a variant of Ramsey&rsquo;s treatment of theoretical
terms that Carnap had rediscovered in the 1950s and 60s
(Carnap&rsquo;s papers are cited by Lewis 1970), as we discuss in the
supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 4)</a>.
 Of course, any such definition by definite description would come
with the presupposition that there is one, and only one, <i>f</i> that
satisfies the relevant postulates. Apart from that kind of difficulty,
the strategy seems viable. However, Carnap did not actually follow any
of these threads of reasoning in the <em>Aufbau</em>. (There are
further problems concerning the phenomenalist constitution of the
physical world in the <em>Aufbau</em>: see e.g. Friedman 1999:
160f.)</p>

<p>
In any case, the step from the &ldquo;world of experience&rdquo; into
the physical world seems to require means of concept formation that
exceed those of the standard explicit definition of predicates as
investigated in the modern theory of first-order definitions (see,
e.g., Chapter 8 of Suppes 1957); firstly, because standard explicit
definitions of predicates in the modern sense of the term do not
involve definite descriptions, such as the &ldquo;the binary relation
<i>R</i>, such that&rdquo; or &ldquo;the function <i>f</i>, such
that&rdquo; above). And secondly, because standard explicit
definitions of predicates only involve first-order quantification,
while &lsquo;<i>R</i>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<i>f</i>&rsquo; in the
examples just given are <em>higher-order</em> variables for relations
and functions of individuals, not first-order variables for
individuals. Carnap himself did <em>not</em> restrict definitions in
the <em>Aufbau</em> to first-order definitions but exploited the full
expressive power of the language of the simple theory of types;
however, he left this aside when he took the crucial step into the
physical world.</p>

<p>
That parts of the <em>Aufbau</em>, including its proposals for concept
formation, needed amendment, was the diagnosis that Carnap himself
arrives at in <em>Testability and Meaning</em> (1936&ndash;37) less
than ten years after the <em>Aufbau</em>, when he observes that the
meaning of disposition terms (such as &ldquo;soluble in water&rdquo;)
cannot be determined in any straightforward manner by standard
explicit definitions that are based solely on observational terms (see
supplement on
 <a href="reconstruct-sci-theories.html#DispTermTestMean">Reconstruction of Scientific Theories (Section 2)</a>).</p>

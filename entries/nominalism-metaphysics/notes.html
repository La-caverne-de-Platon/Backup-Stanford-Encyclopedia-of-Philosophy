<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Nominalism in Metaphysics</a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>
 There is a third conception of
Nominalism, championed by Nelson Goodman, on which it is the doctrine
that there is &lsquo;no distinction of entities without distinction of
content&rsquo;, which comes to be the idea that no two distinct
entities can be broken down into exactly the same atoms (1972,
159&ndash;60). This is different from the two senses of Nominalism
distinguished in the main text, since it does not reject universals or
abstract objects <em>per se</em>. Clearly some abstract objects and
universals must be rejected by Goodmanian Nominalism: sets or classes,
structured propositions, structural universals; but the problem with
these is not that they are abstract or universal but that they violate
Goodman's principle that no two distinct entities can be composed
of the same atoms. Though the motivation for Goodman's Nominalism
is one of the motivations for the other two kinds of Nominalism
distinguished above, namely the &lsquo;aversion to unwonted
multiplication of entities&rsquo; (Goodman 1972, 159), Goodman's
Nominalism is very different from the other two kinds of Nominalism
since rather than rejecting a kind of entity what it rejects is a
&lsquo;means of construction&rsquo; (Goodman 1986, 160) or composition.
Why does Goodman call it &lsquo;Nominalism&rsquo;? He sometimes states
his view as the view that the world is a world of individuals (1972,
155) and this sounds nominalist in the sense of rejecting universals.
However, for Goodman an individual is simply the value of a variable of
the lowest type in a certain system and so a universal could count as
an individual for him. Since Goodman&acute;s conception of Nominalism
is not widespread I shall not discuss it in this entry.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>
 Thus
so-called Trope Theory counts as a kind of Nominalism. In
Rodriguez-Pereyra 2002 the word &lsquo;Nominalism&rsquo; is given a
sense according to which it means the rejection of universals and
tropes (2002, 3). Although the word is sometimes used in that more
restricted sense, it is more correct and more in line with older
tradition to use &lsquo;Nominalism&rsquo; (in one of its senses) to
mean rejection of universals.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>
 Lowe's view is not that
this is the only proper characterisation of abstract objects, but
simply that this is one of them.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>
 This is true, for instance, of
the Nominalism of Goodman and Quine in their joint 1947 paper, at least
as far as non-spatiotemporality is concerned (Goodman and Quine 1947,
105).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>
 The main sceptic about such a
distinction was F. P. Ramsey (1925).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>
 The way I have drawn the
distinction between particulars and universals is by no means
unproblematic. Firstly, there are problems with the instantiation
relation. It is not clear whether it is indeed prior to the distinction
between particulars and universals or even exactly what it consists in.
Secondly, the distinction entails that although <em>roundness</em> and
<em>squareness</em> are universals, <em>(round and square)-ness</em> is
not, since given that nothing can be round and square, <em>(round and
square)-ness</em> can have no instances. But, if <em>roundness</em> and
<em>squareness</em> are universals and <em>(round and square)-ness</em>
exists, it is plausible that <em>(round and square)-ness</em> is a
universal. Thirdly, the distinction entails that properties that can
have only one instance, like the property of <em>being the tallest man
ever</em>, count as particulars, but it is not clear that, if there are
universals, this property should not be classified as a universal. I do
not mean to suggest that these problems are not solvable, nor do I mean
to suggest that they are.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
 Another option, exemplified in
Armstrong (1997, 118&ndash;19), is to accept that a relation of
instantiation must be postulated, but to argue that only one is needed,
because all the steps of the regress supervene upon the first and
supervenience brings no ontological addition. The idea that
supervenience brings no ontological addition is controversial.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>
 Although close to it, this need
not amount to the same as Goodman's principle that no two
entities can be broken down into the same entities, for it can be held,
as in Lewis 1986b, that composition is the combining of <em>many</em>
things into one, and that sets are sums of singletons. In that case the
principle that no two things can be composed by exactly the same parts
does not rule out singleton sets, since the singleton is not generated
through the combining of <em>many</em> things. But Goodman's
principle is supposed to rule out singleton sets.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>
 Campbell calls tropes
&lsquo;abstract&rsquo; because he takes as abstract those entities that
do not ordinarily exist apart from other instances of qualities, not
because he thinks of them as non-spatiotemporal (Campbell 1990,
2&ndash;3).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>
 Alternatively one might say that
properties <em>are</em> predicates or that properties <em>are</em>
concepts. But these views seem to have very little appeal, and are
subject to the same difficulties as Predicate Nominalism and Concept
Nominalism as presented in the main text of this entry.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>
 Except for &lsquo;Trope
Theory&rsquo;, all the names of the other nominalist theories in this
subsection derive from Armstrong 1978, vol. I, 12&ndash;16.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>
 By the aggregate of scarlet
things it is meant the aggregate of wholly scarlet things. The wholly
scarlet parts of partially scarlet things count as wholly scarlet
things.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>
 No distinction between classes
and sets is intended in this entry.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>
 In the case of <em>n</em>-place
relations, the theory identifies them with classes of ordered
<em>n</em>-tuples.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>
 It is assumed here that
particulars are world-bound, i.e. that none are parts of more than one
world, as is the case in Lewis' theory.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>
 This does not mean that
necessarily every one who believes that sets of spatiotemporally
located members are spatiotemporally located is committed to the idea
that such sets are concrete, for they might draw the abstract/concrete
distinction in a different way than I have done here. But it does mean
that they take sets of spatiotemporally located members to be concrete
<em>in the sense of this entry</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>
 Why &lsquo;particulars and/or
properties and/or relations&rsquo;? Because propositions may have only
properties or relations as constituents. An example might be the
proposition that scarlet resembles vermillion. But properties and
relations, as we saw in a previous section, may be reducible to
particulars, in which case every proposition must have particulars as
constituents.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>
 Note that Quine thought that the
relativity of eternal sentences to languages turned them problematic in
a way similar to propositions, for Quine thought that the notion of
language has no clear and intelligible conditions of identity, and this
is what he found problematic about propositions (Quine 1969, 142).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a>
 As presented in Balaguer 1998,
semantic fictionalism is inspired by and similar, but not exactly
analogous, to the kind of fictionalism defended by Hartry Field in the
Philosophy of Mathematics (1980). In particular, unlike Field's
mathematical fitcionalism, Balaguer's semantic fictionalism does
not require that reference to abstract objects is dispensable (1998,
811). Balaguer does not assert that semantic fictionalism is true
(1998, 810).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>
 But sometimes the word
&lsquo;Nominalism&rsquo; is used in connection to a stance with respect
to possible worlds, e.g. in Loux 1998, 176. But Loux
uses it in a sense different from the one adopted in this entry. For
Loux the &lsquo;possible worlds nominalist&rsquo; must believe that
other worlds exist and contain only concrete particulars and that by
means of such possible worlds and the concrete particulars that
populate them is possible to carry out the nominalistic project of
providing a reductive account of talk about properties, propositions,
and the like (1998, 176). The nominalist about possible worlds, as I
shall understand the position here, is committed neither to the claim
that such reductive account is possible nor to the claim that possible
worlds exist.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a> Note that sometimes
Plantinga doesn't use a biconditional but instead says only that a
states of affairs <i>S</i> includes (precludes) a states of
affairs <i>S</i>* <i>if</i> &hellip; (1974: 45, 2003a: 107). But it is
quite clear that he is providing definitions (1974: 44), which is why
the biconditional is more appropriate, and indeed he uses the
biconditional in his 2003b: 194 when introducing the notion of
inclusion.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>
 Stalnaker takes possible worlds
to be properties. But are his possible worlds universals? If it is
essential of universals that they can have more than one instance then
Stalnaker's possible worlds seem not to be universals, since they
can have only one instance.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a>
 As it is clear from his 1986b,
Forrest takes these uninstantiated properties to be universals.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a>
 Note that here every subset of a
world is a world itself, something that does not happen in Adams'
account, since on his account the sets of propositions that constitute
possible worlds are maximal.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a>
 Lewis explored four different
ways of drawing the abstract/concrete distinction (the Way of Example,
the Way of Conflation, the Negative Way, and the Way of Abstraction)
and the consequences that these ways had with respect to the
concreteness of possible worlds as he took them to be. He concluded
that, &lsquo;by and large, and with some doubts in connection with the
Way of Example and the Negative Way&rsquo;, he should say of worlds as
he took them to be that they are concrete (1986a, 86).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a>
 Rodriguez-Pereyra 2004 proposes
an alternative modal realist conception of possible worlds as sums or
collections of, among other things, pure sets. If this is what possible
worlds are it seems that they are not concrete, or at least not purely
concrete.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a>
 These are <em>first order</em>
atomic states of affairs. Higher order states of affairs can bring
together more than one universal. Armstrong admits higher order states
of affairs.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a>
 But there is an exception to
Armstrong's combinatorialism. Strictly speaking not all the
possible states of affairs are combinations of the elements of the
actual world. Some of them involve <em>alien</em> particulars, that is
particulars that do not exist in the actual world (1989, 58). Armstrong
rejects, though, <em>alien</em> universals (1989, 55). Thus no possible
state of affairs can involve universals not present in the actual
world.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-29" name="29">29.</a>
 With a couple of further
conditions: that the conjunction in question be a <em>totality</em> of
atomic states of affairs and that for every particular figuring in a
conjunction of states of affairs that is a possible world there must be
at least one state of affairs in that conjunction in which the
particular is combined with a monadic universal. See Armstrong (1989,
47&ndash;8).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-30" name="30">30.</a>
 That the prefix is called a
&lsquo;story prefix&rsquo; does not mean that what is mentioned within
the prefix must be a work of fiction: it can be any representation
whatsoever, whether true or false (Rosen 1990, 331). So it can be a
philosophical theory postulating the existence of possible worlds.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-31" name="31">31.</a>
 Clearly modal fictionalism is an
option not only for those who believe that possible worlds do not
exist, but also for those who simply do not believe that they
exist.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a>
 But the modal fictionalist need
not be a nominalist about abstract objects in general, in which case he
need not worry about whether theories are abstract or concrete.</p>

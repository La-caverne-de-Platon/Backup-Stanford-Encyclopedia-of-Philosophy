<h2><a name="ExpEpi">Explanatory Epiphenomenalism</a></h2>

<p>
Recognition of an irreducible explanatory role for reasons, and mental
properties generally, as expressed in the dual <em>explananda</em>
strategy, does not by itself fully do away with epiphenomenalist
concerns. In light of mental anomalism, why think that reason
explanations are causal explanations, rather than a <em>sui
generis</em> form of noncausal explanation? The need for a causal
relation between mental events cited in reason explanations (see
discussion of the &lsquo;because&rsquo; problem in 2.2) doesn&rsquo;t
settle this issue once we have distinguished between causal relations
and explanations (see section
 <a href="index-2.html#EpiObj">6</a>).
 Neil Campbell (1998 and 2005) argues for an interpretation of
Anomalous Monism on which while mental events stand in causal
relations with each other, reason explanations are not causal
explanations. He calls this &lsquo;explanatory
epiphenomenalism&rsquo;. Causal explanations explain because they fit
singular causal occurrences into true causal generalizations (2005,
442&ndash;43). However, reason explanations, according to Campbell,
are more plausibly thought of as functioning along different lines:
reasons explain actions by revealing the agent&rsquo;s rationality in
so acting in light of those reasons (2005, 445). The point of this
explanatory epiphenomenalism is not to criticize reason explanations
as illusory&mdash;as wrongly claiming to explain&mdash;but rather to
point up limitations of the domain of causal explanation. On this
view, not all genuine explanations are causal&mdash;reason
explanations are <em>sui generis</em> and capture a distinctive
pattern in nature that would otherwise be missed. This is an
interesting twist on the noncausal theories of actions (2.2),
acknowledging both Davidson&rsquo;s criticism of them (the
&lsquo;because&rsquo; problem) in insisting on causal efficacy
(reasons cause (extensional) actions) yet also acknowledging their
disavowal of causal explanation as a model for reason explanation and
refusal to accept that only causal explanations capture real patterns
in nature. It also explicitly connects the distinctive feature of
reason explanation&mdash;rationality&mdash;to the reality of reasons
and mental properties generally (see
 <a href="index-2.html#CauDefArg">4.3</a>).
 Campbell is influenced in this line of thinking by McDowell&rsquo;s
reading of mental anomalism
 (<a href="index-2.html#UncStrRatIdeMcD">4.2.2</a>),
 though he goes beyond McDowell in denying that reason explanations
are causal.</p>

<p>
Campbell acknowledges that reasons which explain actions are backed by
generalizations (<em>ceteris paribus</em> ones), but claims that this
fact &ldquo;takes a back seat&rdquo; to the normative dimension of
rationalizing explanation, because generalizations record mere
tendencies while rational explanations observe what agents
<em>should</em> do&mdash;the fact that the generalizations hold is
explicable by rationality, something that is not true of other forms
of explanation (2005, 445). (Though Campbell doesn&rsquo;t argue this
explicitly, in this vein one might also point to the fact that the
truth of the generalizations does not&mdash;indeed,
cannot&mdash;<em>explain</em> the fact that the relations covered are
<em>rational</em>. This is a key point in Kim&rsquo;s reconstruction
of the argument for mental anomalism&mdash;see
 <a href="index-2.html#NorVsDesPriKim">4.2.1</a>.)
 The epistemic satisfaction that reason explanations provide is
achieved differently than that of causal explanations&mdash;not by
being an instance of a generalization, but rather by being a
realization of rationality.</p>

<p>
By itself, this point does not appear to rule out the idea that
reasons explanations are causal explanations. Indeed, it seems to be a
<em>non sequitur</em>. First, in other cases where explanations
covered by generalizations are not thereby causal
explanations&mdash;for instance, logic&mdash;the obstacle has to do
with not meeting basic conditions for causal explanations, such as
temporal succession. But such conditions are met in reason
explanations. Second, as we have seen
 (<a href="index-2.html#NorVsDesPriKim">4.2.1</a>),
 Davidson emphasizes that a normative component also underlies the
physical realm in constitutive <em>a priori</em> principles. On
Campbell&rsquo;s reasoning, this would prevent physical explanations
from being causal, which is clearly wrong. We see once again a
problematic consequence of interpretations of the argument for mental
anomalism (Kim&rsquo;s and now Campbell&rsquo;s) that highlight a
strong distinction between normative and descriptive principles.
Third, and related to this point, reason explanations might be
different than other causal explanations in their subject matter
without this preventing them from being causal. After all, there are
other causal explanations that are also backed only by <em>ceteris
paribus</em> generalizations, and a point analogous to the one
Campbell emphasizes&mdash;that their constitutive feature explains why
such generalizations hold rather than vice-versa&mdash;has also been
made concerning biological explanations in particular and functional
explanations generally (Macdonalds 1995; for related discussion, see
below).</p>

<p>
If rational explanations could be satisfying despite <em>failing</em>
to be instances of generalizations, then there might be an asymmetry
sufficiently strong to block the assimilation of reasons explanations
to causal explanations. But Campbell does not argue for this, either
in itself or as an interpretation of Davidson, and it has no clear
independent plausibility&mdash;the failure of a reason explanation to
generalize would in fact prevent it from being a satisfying
explanation (see also
 <a href="index-2.html#ConArgMcDChi">4.2.3</a>).
 Reason explanations are satisfying both because they show that an
action is a realization of rationality and <em>also</em> because such
explanations are instances of generalizations. Both conditions are
necessary for reasons explanations, and cannot be pulled apart. None
of this appears to be inconsistent with reasons explanations being
causal explanations, and seems merely to individuate reason
explanations from those that are made relative to different
explanatory interests.</p>

<p>
However, Campbell provides an additional and conceptually distinct
point in favor of an asymmetry between the two that would block
assimilating reason explanations to causal explanations. Even though,
for example, hurricanes and catastrophes don&rsquo;t stand in strict
lawlike relations, the explanation of the latter by the former is
causal because we have at least a rough understanding of how
hurricanes function in terms of underlying mechanisms&mdash;the
physical properties co-instantiated by meteorological events. But the
point of mental anomalism is to deny that there can be any such
understanding in the case of reasons. Therefore, &ldquo;without a
means of connecting reason explanations to their underlying causal
processes in an intelligible fashion there is nothing to account for
their explanatory force if such explanations are taken to be a species
of causal explanations&rdquo; (Campbell 1998, 29). Campbell&rsquo;s
point seems to be that without an explanatory relationship between
reason explanations and the physical causal explanations underlying
them, not only is there no justification for holding reason
explanations to be causal; moreover, the problem of causal explanatory
competition and exclusion pressed by Kim (6.2) rears its head.
Campbell&rsquo;s explanatory epiphenomenalism is thus a form of the
dual <em>explananda</em> solution to Kim&rsquo;s problem, but one that
further eschews explanatory competition between reason and physical
explanations by distinguishing not only their distinct
<em>explanans</em> and <em>explananda</em> but also the form of
explanation (causal or not) that relates them.</p>

<p>
The Macdonalds (1995) hold, as Campbell does, that (1) mental events
are causally efficacious by virtue of being identical with physical
events, and that (2) despite the anomalous nature of reason
explanations, they capture distinctive patterns that account for their
explanatory usefulness. But the Macdonalds don&rsquo;t see this as
incompatible with reason explanations being causal. They cite
biological events and explanations as meeting (1) and (2)&mdash;the
pattern consisting in appearance of design resulting from natural
selection&mdash;but emphasize that these are nonetheless causal
explanations. It thus appears that the difference between their
attitudes is due to the second point raised by Campbell&mdash;whether
there exists an account of <em>how</em> such explanations explain. For
the Macdonalds, there is an underlying account of design and natural
selection in terms of underlying &ldquo;physico-chemical
changes&rdquo;. That suggests that for the Macdonalds there needs to
be an account of reason explanations in terms of the nomological
properties that mental events instance in order for reasons
explanations to be causal explanations&mdash;precisely what Campbell
claims is ruled out by Davidson&rsquo;s mental anomalism. And the
Macdonalds, who accept mental anomalism, indeed hold that the patterns
in both cases&mdash;rational and biological&mdash;must be
&ldquo;reliably produced&rdquo; by co-instanced nomological
properties. However, and crucially, such reliability does not depend
upon or entail <em>exceptionless</em> relations (see further
below).</p>

<p>
Campbell&rsquo;s explanatory epiphenomenalism is in effect calling
into question the Macdonalds&rsquo; underlying assumption that
patterns genuinely occurring &ldquo;in nature&rdquo;&mdash;and thus
<em>real</em>&mdash;must bear an explanatory relation to nomological
properties. On Campbell&rsquo;s view, that assumption is unwarranted,
particularly given the already established causal efficacy of mental
events. Reason explanations can pick out genuine patterns &ldquo;in
nature&rdquo; without being either causal explanations or explainable
in terms of underlying nomological properties. The relevance of this
for the current discussion is whether the Macdonalds&rsquo;
&ldquo;reliable production&rdquo; requirement is consistent with
Anomalous Monism, which Campbell in effect denies. We have already
seen
 (<a href="index-2.html#53SupConMenAno">5.3</a>)
 that the Macdonalds endorse a supervenience relationship between
mental and physical properties, and claim that their conception of
supervenience is consistent with both the strict nature of
supervenience laws and also mental anomalism because we can&rsquo;t
currently state such laws and so are not in a position to predict or
explain mental events on their basis. As we have also seen, this is
consistent with&mdash;indeed, seems ultimately to require&mdash;a
strict explanatory/predictive relationship between physical and mental
properties, making mental anomalism into a merely epistemic and not
metaphysical thesis.</p>

<p>
If one rejects this particular attempt to square supervenience with
mental anomalism, then the quagmire of
 <a href="index-2.html#53SupConMenAno">5.3</a>
 arises&mdash;how to articulate a conception that provides for
dependency without exceptionless prediction or explanation.
Interestingly, the Macdonalds&rsquo; later requirement of
&ldquo;reliable&rdquo; (as opposed to exceptionless) relations is
suggestive of a <em>ceteris paribus</em> conception of supervenience,
which we earlier saw as an unexplored and potentially fruitful
direction to take in trying to square Anomalous Monism with an
explanatory priority of the physical through the supervenience
relation. (Campbell valiantly but implausibly tries to fit
Davidson&rsquo;s appeals to supervenience into Campbell&rsquo;s
explanatory epiphenomenalist framework by claiming that while reason
explanations depend upon physical causal explanations, this is a
semantic and not a metaphysical thesis (Campbell 1998, 37&ndash;38),
and so presumably does not entail an explanatory relationship between
the mental and the physical of the kind pressed by the Macdonalds.
Much of what we have seen Davidson saying about supervenience is
inconsistent with this interpretation.)</p>

<p>
Since Campbell allows that reason explanations make actions
intelligible without falling under exceptionless generalizations
(mental anomalism), he can&rsquo;t object that physical properties
cannot make reasons intelligible simply because of an anomalous
relation between them. It might be responded that physical properties
cannot make reasons intelligible because &ldquo;making
intelligible&rdquo; means making <em>rationally</em> intelligible, and
this is not something that physical properties are in the business of
providing (as emphasized by the dual <em>explananda</em> approach).
While this is true, it is both question-begging and misses the point.
Explanations always make phenomena intelligible <em>within the terms
of the particular explanatory framework</em>. This is the point of the
idea that explanation is interest-relative. Within the framework of
understanding the relationship between physical and mental properties,
<em>ceteris paribus</em> relations can make it intelligible why some
mental event is occurring&mdash;<em>because some physical event is
occurring, and there is a ceteris paribus relationship between
them</em>&mdash;even while not providing an exceptionless explanation
for its occurrence. Rational intelligibility is not the only kind of
intelligibility. As Campbell himself notes, the sort of explanation
that physical properties can provide for hurricanes is neither
exceptionless nor rational, but it nonetheless makes it intelligible
why a hurricane is occurring or how it is behaving within its own
particular explanatory framework.</p>

<p>
The debate about asymmetries between reason and other explanations
does not end here, and though we cannot explore it any further, it is
worth briefly noting one direction in which it inevitably goes that is
close to the heart of Anomalous Monism. A plausible question to ask at
this point is <em>why</em> the generalizations&mdash;whether strict or
<em>ceteris paribus</em>&mdash;hold at the most basic level between
physical properties, between mental properties, and between the two.
In other words, why are the fundamental laws of our world as they are?
Now, an initial answer to this question might be that it is in the
nature of the properties related that the laws are what they are.
However, this answer masks an important asymmetry between the
different kinds of generalizations, emphasized by both Kim and
McDowell
 (<a href="index-2.html#NorVsDesPriKim">4.2.1&ndash;4.2.2</a>)
 and reflected in Campbell&rsquo;s discussion. In the case of both
purely physical and psychophysical generalizations, we can conceive of
the possibility of different relations holding. (Though this point is
powerfully intuitive, it is no simple task to make precise. For
relevant discussion, see Chalmers 1996, Mumford 2009 and Latham 2011).
This is the case whether the generalizations are strict or <em>ceteris
paribus</em>. In the case of psychophysical generalizations in
particular, there is no convincing answer forthcoming to the question
of why these mental properties supervene on these rather than other
physical properties. However, to the question &ldquo;Why are these
actions explained by these reasons?&rdquo;, there is a deeper level of
explanation available. And the answer isn&rsquo;t simply
&ldquo;Because of a rational relation between the two&rdquo;. Rather,
it is because that rational relation <em>has no conceivable
alternative</em>. It is not intelligible to us that those reasons
might explain very different kinds of actions. As we have seen, it
isn&rsquo;t at all obvious that this asymmetry entails that reason
explanations are not causal explanations, as Campbell insists. But
there is no question that this asymmetry is important to our
understanding of Anomalous Monism and the nature and status of reason
explanations.</p>

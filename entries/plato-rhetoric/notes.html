<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Plato on Rhetoric and Poetry</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 From Thomas 1954: 192&ndash;93.</p></div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 While &ldquo;representation&rdquo; and &ldquo;imitation&rdquo; are
standard meanings of &ldquo;mimesis,&rdquo; the inclusion of
&ldquo;expression&rdquo; in a list of possible meanings of the term
might seem odd. I say just a bit below in support of this; for a
full-fledged argument, see Halliwell 2002. On p. 14 (n. 31) he
remarks: &ldquo;I develop my twin theses that ancient ideas of mimesis
often encompass a dimension of what would now be counted, by many
aestheticians, as expression, and that representation and expression
are not mutually exclusive concepts in the interpretation of art, as
they have so often been taken to be (especially under the influence of
Croce), in chapters 4, 5, 8, 10 (notes 23, 47), and 12.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Unless otherwise noted, I shall be using Bloom&rsquo;s (1968)
translation of the <em>Republic</em>. For the Greek text of the
<em>Republic</em> I have used Burnet (ed.) 1968. The
identity of the authors quoted here by Plato&rsquo;s Socrates is not known,
though the lines seem to be from lyric poetry and from comedy
(possibly they are all from comedy). This is surprising in that one
would have expected Socrates to identify well established opponents,
presumably authors contributing to the main genres of poetry he has
been attacking (tragedy and epic). See the sources cited in the next note.</p></div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 See Nightingale 1995, p. 65, and ch. 2 generally on the literary and
historical context of the &ldquo;quarrel.&rdquo; See also Most 2011 and Notomi 2011. Whether Plato is also
the last major philosopher to discern a deep and comprehensive
conflict between philosophy and poetry is an interesting question.
Certainly Plato&rsquo;s best student, Aristotle, did not follow Plato in
this respect. At the same time, like many philosophers Aristotle
clearly believes that when it comes to grasping truth, philosophy is
superior to poetry. It is often noted that some of Plato&rsquo;s
philosophical predecessors, such as Xenophanes and Heraclitus, did
direct rather severe criticisms against poets (including Homer and
Hesiod).</p></div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 See Plato&rsquo;s <em>Apology</em> 18b-19e. Socrates lists several sophists
by name&mdash;Gorgias, Prodicus, Hippias (all three of whom appear in
Plato&rsquo;s dialogues, and two of whom are named in the titles of
dialogues)&mdash;and denies that he possesses the knowledge they sell.
I note that some scholars capitalize &ldquo;Sophist&rdquo; and
cognates when referring to an established profession in ancient
Greece, a convention I have avoided here in order to avoid both
confusion as well as giving the impression that there existed an
established or well defined &ldquo;school&rdquo; of sophistry.</p></div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 For further discussion of the interpretive issues, see Annas and
Rowe (eds.) 2002; Blondell 2002; and Griswold (ed.) 2002 [1988].
See also Griswold 1999b and a follow-up exchange with Kahn
published in the same journal, volume 20 (2000), pp. 189&ndash;97. The
bibliographies to these works offer numerous other relevant
sources.</p></div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 It is not known whether or not Ion is Plato&rsquo;s literary creation. The
interlocutors in Plato&rsquo;s dialogues are sometimes historical characters
(whose pronouncements are with rare exceptions assumed to be Plato&rsquo;s
invention), sometimes not, even within the same dialogue (as possibly
is in the case of the <em>Ion</em>; we know that a Socrates did
exist). All quotations from the <em>Ion</em> are from the translation
in Woodruff 1997.</p></div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 <em>Apol.</em> 20d-e, 29a-b. Recall that in the <em>Apol.</em>
Socrates recounts that to discover the meaning of the pronouncement of
the Oracle at Delphi (that no one is wiser than Socrates), he
interrogated three types of claimants to wisdom: the politicians, the
poets, and the artisans. The poets were unable to answer his questions
about the meaning of their poetry&mdash;bystanders could do that
better!&mdash;from which it seemed to follow that poets do not work
from wisdom so much as from inspiration (<em>Apol.</em> 22b-c).
Naturally, the poets were angry with Socrates, and contributed to the
indictment of Socrates (<em>Apol.</em> 23e).</p></div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Gadamer asks: &ldquo;Although Plato assures us to the contrary,
is not his inability to do justice to the poets and to the art of
poetry nevertheless an expression of the age-old rivalry between poets
and philosophers?&rdquo; See Gadamer 1980, p. 46.</p></div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 In book III, music is assessed and regulated, and at 401a-c Socrates
suggests that painting too, inter alia, must be regulated. This raises
the question as to whether the critique of poetry is meant to extend
to all of the &ldquo;fine arts.&rdquo; Whatever the answer, it is
clear that discursive poetry poses the greatest danger, presumably
because its medium is that by which we primarily articulate and shape
both soul and world.</p></div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 It should be noted that Socrates also allows, in passing, that the
guardians can imitate unworthy characters &ldquo;in play&rdquo;
(396d3&ndash;e2); perhaps, that is, by way of making fun of them, but in any
case without really identifying with them or being really affected
(won over, shaped) by them. Plato himself imitates &ldquo;bad&rdquo;
people, however, both in the <em>Republic</em> and elsewhere.</p></div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 The commentator referred to is Clay; see Clay 2000, pp. 118,
120.</p></div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 For a discussion of some of them, see Griswold 1981.</p></div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 This point is made (and &ldquo;counterfeit&rdquo; is used) in Urmson
1997, p. 233.</p></div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 This point is made in a slightly stronger form in Clay 2000, p. 146.
As he intriguingly puts it: &ldquo;Socrates is describing himself [at
<em>Rep</em>. 604e], which is to say that Plato, who never competed as
a tragedian in the dramatic festivals of Athens, is describing the
subject of his own dramatic imitations.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 Lear 1998, p. 240.</p></div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Ferrari helpfully notes that &ldquo;poets will appeal to
that in us which dwells upon the particular flavour of a human
situation rather than to our capacity to minimise it; being vivid,
after all, is what the medium of imitation both invites and excels at.
It has an inbuilt tendency, then, to heighten the particular, to focus
upon crises.&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;It is not the passing tremor
caused by the sound or appearance of the imitation that he [Plato]
considers most dangerous, but the deeper fear of which it is a
symptom&mdash;a fear which can hold sway over an entire life &hellip;
. For if my heart swells as I watch son part from mother, or lovers
lose their chance of happiness, it swells not only for the characters
but for the human situation to which the performance gives me access:
I weep that sons must part from mothers, that things should be
so.&rdquo; See Ferrari 1989, pp. 134, 140.</p></div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 Tragedy is referred to six times in book X (595b4, 597e6, 598d8,
602b9, 605c11, 607a3; see also 595c1). Comedy is referred to twice
(without citation of any authors of comedies), in one paragraph
(606c2&ndash;9). Tragedy is plainly Socrates&rsquo; chief target in his critique
of poetry, but it is not his only one. Since Homer is identified as
the origin of tragedy and is the most important target of the
criticism, and since he wrote in epic, &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; is being
taken in a sense that goes beyond literary form. The &ldquo;tragic
vision of life&rdquo; is Socrates&rsquo; target.</p></div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Plato&rsquo;s refusal to carve off a realm of the aesthetic from the
ethical may be connected at a deep level to a refusal to treat the
beautiful as though it were thinkable separately from the good. One of
the underpinnings of Plato&rsquo;s account, that is, may be a metaphysical
view.</p></div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Ferrari again puts it well: &ldquo;The poet has a skill all his own:
not understanding, but capturing the appearance, the look and feel of
human life. But just as an image is, or rather should be (in Plato&rsquo;s
view), for the sake of its original, the art of image-making is
destined to be the helpmate of the art that seeks truth. Poetry
cannot, so to speak, be trusted on its own, but as the ward of a
philosophic guardian can put its talent to good use.&rdquo; See
Ferrari 1989, p. 108.</p></div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 <em>Symp.</em> 205b8&ndash;c2. Socrates there says &ldquo;Well, you know,
for example, that &lsquo;poetry&rsquo; has a very wide range. After
all, everything that is responsible for creating something out of
nothing is a kind of poetry; and so all the creations of every craft
and profession are themselves a kind of poetry, and everyone who
practices a craft is a poet&rdquo;.  I am using the Nehamas and
Woodruff (1997a) translation of the <em>Symposium</em>. See also Notomi 2011.</p></div>

<div id="note-22">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 See <em>Rep</em>. 500e-501c (cf. 484c-d) where the
philosopher-founder is compared to a painter. At 500c2&ndash;7 we are told,
remarkably, that he &ldquo;imitates&rdquo; the Forms, likening himself
to them as much as possible.&nbsp;</p></div>

<div id="note-23">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 See Urmson 1997, pp. 231&ndash;233, for a striking list of quotations to
this effect, including the lines from Dylan Thomas quoted at the start
of this essay.</p></div>

<div id="note-24">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 See Nehamas 1999, pp. 279&ndash;299. On p. 287 he asserts that &ldquo;the
greatest part of contemporary criticisms of television depends on a
moral disapproval that is identical to Plato&rsquo;s attack on epic and
tragic poetry in the fourth century B.C.&rdquo; See also Halliwell 2011.</p></div>

<div id="note-25">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 For an analysis of the rhetoric and the meaning of the rhetoric of
the <em>Prot.</em>, see Griswold 1999a. I will be quoting from the
Zeyl (1997) translation  of the <em>Gorgias</em>, except that I have substituted
&ldquo;rhetoric&rdquo; for &ldquo;oratory.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div id="note-26">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 For an interesting discussion, see Roochnik 1991b.</p></div>

<div id="note-27">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>
 Scully (2003, p. 15, n. 39) notes that Socrates&rsquo; first speech is
&ldquo;the <em>only</em> speech in all of Plato where a speaker calls
upon the Muses.&rdquo;.</p></div>

<div id="note-28">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 I am using the Nehamas and Woodruff 1997b translation of the
<em>Phaedrus</em>.</p></div>

<div id="note-29">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>
 By contrast: Plato concludes the <em>Sophist</em> with a series of
distinctions intended to isolate and describe the sophist. They
include the distinction between a speaker who does not know the truth
but thinks he does, and a speaker who (rightly) suspects that he does
not know the truth but nonetheless pretends to his audience that he
does. The latter, the sophist, is an &ldquo;insincere and
unknowing&rdquo; (268c8&ndash;9) imitator of the truth. It is presupposed in
these passages that the sophist has an art (<em>techne</em>). I am using the 
N. P. White (1997) translation of the <em>Sophist</em>.</p></div>

<div id="note-30">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>
 In the <em>Sophist</em> (263e) and <em>Theaetetus</em> (189e) Plato
defines thinking as the soul&rsquo;s conversation with itself.</p></div>

<div id="note-31">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a>
 For further discussion of this point, including of how the problem of
self-deception is grounded in the <em>Phaedrus</em>&rsquo;
&ldquo;palinode&rdquo; speech, see Griswold 1996 [1986], pp.
172&ndash;173, 199.</p></div>

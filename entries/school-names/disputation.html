<h2>Disputation in Context</h2>

<p>
The constructive and the negative aspects of disputation are helpfully
contrasted in this excerpt from a 3rd-century B.C. text preserved in
several later sources:</p>

<blockquote>
Disputers separate distinct kinds so that they don&rsquo;t interfere
with each other and arrange different starting-points so that they
don&rsquo;t confuse each other. They express intentions, communicate
what they&rsquo;re referring to, and clarify what they&rsquo;re
talking about. They make it so that others share their knowledge and
don&rsquo;t strive to perplex each other. So the winner doesn&rsquo;t
lose what he defends, and the loser gains what he&rsquo;s seeking. If
done this way, then disputation is admissible.

<p>
When it comes to complicating phrases to falsify each other&rsquo;s
words, embellishing expressions to pervert what each other says, and
giving trick analogies to twist the other&rsquo;s point, they stretch
the other&rsquo;s words so there&rsquo;s no way to get to his thought.
If done like this, disputation interferes with the Great Way. Engaging
in tangled debates and competing to see who&rsquo;s last to quit
can&rsquo;t but be harmful to a
 gentleman.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Of particular interest are the details of the positive description in
the first half of the passage. Ideally, disputers should seek to
clearly distinguish distinct kinds (<em>lei</em>) of things and
different bases or &ldquo;starting points&rdquo; for using a
 term.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup>
 Keeping these distinctions straight, they clarify the claims they are
making and the things they are referring to and through this process
jointly obtain knowledge. The key to this process of seeking knowledge
is keeping distinctions straight. Conversely, in the harmful style of
disputation, the disputer distorts and twists the opponent&rsquo;s
words, making them come out false or inconsistent or extending them in
unintended ways. The disputer obfuscates the differences between kinds
of things and uses of words, offering flippant arguments for bizarre
assertions to achieve victory at all costs. (The &ldquo;White Horse
Discourse&rdquo; of Gongsun Long is probably an example of this style
of disputation.) </p>

<p>
While explaining the reasons for the disputers&rsquo; notoriety, the
passage at the same time links their activities to mainstream Chinese
philosophy of language, epistemology, and logic. Ancient Chinese
semantic theories explained the use of general terms (see Section 4 of
the entry
 <a href="../mohist-canons/index.html">Mohist Canons</a>),
 and thus communication, by speakers&rsquo; ability to distinguish
(<em>bian</em>) things or stuff (<em>shi</em>) as of the same or
different kinds (<em>lei</em>) and to apply the same name
(<em>ming</em>) to all stuff of a kind. Cognition or judgment was the
attitude of distinguishing an object as being of the kind denoted by
some term. Knowledge was a reliable ability to draw distinctions
correctly, expressed by an ability to apply terms correctly (see
Section 5 of the entry on
 <a href="../mohist-canons/index.html">Mohist Canons</a>).
 Reasoning was a process of analogical extension, taking distinctions
already drawn as a basis for distinguishing further things as
&ldquo;the same&rdquo; or &ldquo;different&rdquo; (<em>tong/yi</em>),
&ldquo;this&rdquo; or &ldquo;not-this&rdquo; (<em>shi/fei</em>),
&ldquo;so&rdquo; or &ldquo;not-so&rdquo; (<em>ran/bu ran</em>). (See
Section 7 of the entry on
 <a href="../mohist-canons/index.html">Mohist Canons</a>.)
 Thus semantics, knowledge, and reasoning were all seen as grounded in
a process of distinguishing similar from different kinds of
things&mdash;the same process that is the core constituent activity in
disputation. Indeed, the Chinese graphs typically translated as
&ldquo;distinguish&rdquo; and &ldquo;disputation&rdquo; are pronounced
the same (<em>bian</em>), have the same phonetic component, and are
used interchangeably in ancient texts. Arguably they express two
senses of a single word. Disputation concerned how to distinguish
distinct kinds of things, thus identifying what was &ldquo;of a
kind&rdquo; with what. So in the ancient Chinese philosophical
context, disputation by its nature brought the participants just a
step or two away from fundamental questions concerning how language
relates to the world, how we know whether a claim is correct or not,
what the criteria are for knowledge, and what makes some analogical
inferences correct, others not. </p>

<p>
These issues were not merely academic. Distinguishing the referents of
names properly was regarded as an essential element of successful
political rule, in at least two ways. First, language was seen as an
indispensable tool for political administration, specifically for
controlling and directing people&rsquo;s behavior. Early Chinese
philosophers emphasized the action-guiding functions of language to an
extent not seen in the Western tradition. Like their Greek
counterparts, such as Aristotle, Chinese thinkers regarded language as
a means of expressing thought (see Section 4 of the entry on
 <a href="../mohist-canons/index.html">Mohist Canons</a>).
 But the thoughts that dominated their attention were instructions and
commands, not statements and reports. This is why many thinkers were
especially concerned with the issue of &ldquo;correcting names&rdquo;
(<em>zheng ming</em>), or rectifying and unifying the norms by which
everyone in the linguistic community distinguishes the extensions of
general terms. If speakers use terms differently, taking the same word
to pick out different kinds of things, they will be unable to follow
commands as their superiors intend. The result, according to some
ancient writers, will inevitably be anarchy or disorder. </p>

<blockquote>
Correcting names and examining divisions, these are the reins of
governing.&hellip; Suppose there were a man who when he sought oxen
used the name &lsquo;horse&rsquo; and when he sought horses used the
name &lsquo;ox&rsquo;. He would surely not obtain what he sought. And
if because of this he resorted to threats and anger, the steward would
surely complain, and the oxen and horses would surely be in disorder.
The hundred officials are a multitude of stewards, the myriad things a
herd of oxen and horses. Not correcting their names or clearly
dividing their job duties, yet frequently employing punishments and
fines&mdash;no disorder is greater than this. (<em>The Annals of
L&uuml; Buwei,</em> 17.1/408)
</blockquote>

<p>
Hence, as a famous passage from the Confucian <em>Analects</em>
explains, &ldquo;correcting names&rdquo; is an essential part of
governing (for further discussion, see Loy 2020):</p>

<blockquote>
&ldquo;If the ruler of Wei awaited you to manage his government, what
would you do first?&rdquo;

<p>
Confucius said, &ldquo;It would surely be to correct names! If names
are not correct, speech does not conform [to the facts]. If speech
does not conform, affairs are not completed,&hellip;punishments and
fines are not on the mark,&hellip;and people have nowhere to put hand
or foot. So the names the gentleman uses surely can be spoken
[appropriately in the particular context], and his speech surely can
be carried out. The gentleman, with respect to his speech, simply
allows nothing reckless.&rdquo; (<em>Analects,</em> 13.3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Second, if the ruler&rsquo;s use of words is at odds with
reality&mdash;with the actual &ldquo;shapes&rdquo; (<em>xing</em>) of
things, which serve as criteria for the correct use of names according
to received norms&mdash;this will lead to mistaken judgment, failed
plans, and ultimately social disorder (<em>luan</em>).</p>

<blockquote>
All disorder is a matter of shape and name not fitting. A ruler,
though unworthy, may seem to employ the worthy, heed the good, and do
what is admissible. The problem is that those he calls worthy are
unworthy, what he calls good is depraved, and what he calls admissible
is perverse. This is form and name being different in fact, word and
object referring to different things. When the unworthy are taken to
be worthy, the depraved good, the perverse admissible, how can the
state be free of disorder and the ruler&rsquo;s person escape danger?
(<em>Annals,</em> 16.8/401)
</blockquote>

<p>
So for some thinkers, how we distinguish terms is among the keys to
sociopolitical order. If language is to guide action efficiently and
reliably, everyone in the speech community must distinguish the
referents of the terms used in instructions, ritual codes, legal
codes, job titles, and political titles in the same, consistent way.
Otherwise, people will not understand the content of their jobs and
duties, nor be able to carry out commands or follow laws. Linguistic
anarchy leads to political anarchy. This is why Xunzi, for example,
considers disrupting names and distinctions&mdash;as the disputers did
in their sophistries and paradoxes&mdash;a crime comparable to
tampering with tallies and measures (22.1c). The content of the
disputers&rsquo; controversies may sometimes have been frivolous, but
the underlying issues were vital. </p>

<p>
In this intellectual and political context, many interrelated
questions arise concerning norms for using names and distinguishing
their referents. What should the criteria be for distinguishing and
naming things one way or another? Is there any objective basis for the
distinctions&mdash;are there natural kinds? Or are distinctions
between kinds purely conventional? By virtue of what do particular
things belong to one kind or another? How should names correspond to
things&mdash;one name for each identifiable kind of thing, or can some
names refer more generally to several types of things? On what basis
do we apply naming criteria in practice? Do we even need fixed
criteria, or could we get along perfectly well without
&ldquo;correcting names,&rdquo; merely adopting temporary, convenient
standards for drawing distinctions in particular
 situations?<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup>
 </p>

<p>
These are the sorts of questions that motivated the intellectually
compelling aspects of the disputers&rsquo; theses and paradoxes. Some
of the disputers, in particular those identified with the School of
Names, seem to have held that distinctions between kinds of things
exist only relative to artificial or conventional standards, which may
be entirely arbitrary. Since these standards are not fixed by nature,
no way of drawing distinctions is uniquely or absolutely correct. This
point led them to explore how distinctions can be shifted, reversed,
or rejected. Pushing this idea further, some disputers may have held
that in principle distinctions could be abandoned entirely, leading us
to view the world as an undivided whole, the &ldquo;Great One.&rdquo;
(We will return to this idea in the section on
 <a href="index-2.html#5">Hui Shi</a>.)
 This questioning of distinctions and their ontological basis,
combined with the mereological worldview shared by most early Chinese
thinkers, was probably the chief motivation for the disputers&rsquo;
sophistries and paradoxes, many of which are based on relations of
sameness versus difference and part versus whole. Others concern
spatiotemporal relations, though these too can easily be seen as
growing out of a fascination with different ways of drawing
distinctions. </p>

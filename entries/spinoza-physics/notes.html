<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Spinoza&rsquo;s Physical Theory</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 On Peterman's (2012, 2015) account, according to which Spinoza means
something different than Descartes' (and everybody else) by
&ldquo;extension&ldquo;, this agreement is merely nominal. Peterman
argues that Spinoza denies that it is of the essence of physical,
extended things that they take up space, and holds that extension
itself in not dimensional. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Leibniz famously criticized Descartes on this point, arguing that
what is preserved in interactions is a function not of speed and bulk,
but of velocity and what we now think of as mass; that is, it is
momentum that is preserved. Leibniz took this to entail that there are
powers of bodies that are not reducible to or accountable for in terms
of their extensive quantities; this essentially entails a rejection of
the Cartesian idea that the essence of body is exhausted by extension.
Spinoza was unaware of Leibniz's criticism of Descartes' conservation
law. Given the experimental basis of Leibniz's argument, it is a fair
question whether Spinoza would have accepted Leibniz's reasoning even
if he had been aware of it.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Of course, there could be no general laws covering interactions
between bodies initially moving along the same line either, since
extra-physical influence could cause a deviation from that line. But
in that case it would be clear, given the laws Descartes in fact
gives, that the deviation arose from external influence. But in cases
involving no change of direction at all, we can be sure that either no
extra-physical influence was brought to bear, or that the net effect
of non-physical influences was null.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 On at least one occasion Spinoza does claim that no ground is
required where Descartes supposes one is. He claims that truth is its
own standard (IIp43s), and therefore needs not be certified by some
grounding criterion, such as Descartes' non-deceiving God. However,
this is not a close parallel to the case of the principle of inertia.
A fundamental capacity to distinguish truth from error is required in
order that we be entitled to recognize any rational demonstration at
all as an indication of the being of things. This can certainly not be
generalized to the claim that we can recognize the truth of any every
idea without attending to its grounds; indeed, the very notion of an
adequate idea is of one that includes its grounds. There is no evident
reason that an adequate, true, conception of the law of inertia should
be exempt from this demand.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a> Schmaltz (2020)
contains a sustained defense of a view of modes on which it is appropriate to
treat Spinoza's finite modes as proper subjects of predication despite
their insubstantiality.</p>
</div>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 That he regards this discussion as inadequate is suggested by his
closing remark that, to set these matters out fully, he would have had
to &ldquo;expand [his] explications and demonstrations.&rdquo; For a
recent discussion denying that the PI has anything much to do with
physics, see Peterman (forthcoming b)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>  Winkler (2016)
argues that the simplest bodies &ldquo;should not be understood as
real at all, but as hypothetical entities, specifically as
infinitesimal or vanishing quantities&rdquo; (p.  99).  While this may
remove an embarrassment, it does not seem to help solve the problem.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Bennett's interpretation attaches to &ldquo;motion and rest&rdquo; as
it figures, not in the PI, but in connection with the eternal and
infinite modes mentioned in <em>E</em>1P21, of which letter 64 says
that &ldquo;motion and rest&rdquo; is an example. On Bennett's view,
the PI is simply incoherent in light of the basic commitment to an
adjectival account of bodies.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 <em>PCP</em>IId5n.2 perhaps leaves more room to maneuver: here what
PCPIIP22 later calls &ldquo;motion&rdquo; is characterized as
&ldquo;the force or actions which moves&rdquo; an individual body in
local motion; what gets later called &ldquo;rest&rdquo; is &ldquo;the
force required to take away those certain degrees of motion from the
body so that it is wholly at rest&rdquo;. This, at least, does not
explicitly ascribe these forces to bodies; but nor does it ascribe
them to regions of extension.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 This approach seems to be taken in Bennett (1984), and perhaps
Deuleuze (1990) as well.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>  Winkler (2016)
argues that, for Spinoza, &ldquo;motion-and-rest plays the role of the
relational (preindividual) aspect that individuates bodies&rdquo; and
that this &ldquo;leaves conatus to play the role of the singular
(individuating) aspect of the body&rdquo; (p. 108).  On this view, what
separates out, as it were, individuals with their conative essence is
motion-and-rest; but the resultant individual is the indivdual it is
because of its distinct conatus/essence.  This still leaves it
mysterious how we are to conceive motion-and-rest so that it can do
this indivudating work.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 A complication prohibits us from inferring straightaway that essences
are particular to individuals, and adequate on their own to
individuate them. There is some apparent support to be found in
Spinoza's text for the claim that distinct individuals may share
essence. In Ip17s Spinoza says, &ldquo;a man is the cause of the
existence of another man, but not of his essence, for that latter is
an eternal truth. Hence they can agree entirely according to their
essence. But in existing they must differ.&rdquo; But while not in
outright contradiction with IId2, the idea that two distinct
individuals might agree entirely in their essences has quite
implausible and embarrassing consequences when taken in concert with
it. For suppose I conceive Peter, who has a given essence, through
being caused to have an idea of him by interacting with him. Suppose
further that Paul shares that essence, though I have never interacted
with him. Nonetheless, in conceiving Peter I conceive Paul. Worse yet,
if two distinct individuals may have the same essence, then IId2 would
imply that any two individuals that share the same essence must
co-endure, i.e., must exist determinately at precisely the same times,
since if one of them exists, its essence does, and that essence cannot
exist without that of which it is the essence existing. Not only is
this implausible on its face, it also directly conflicts with the very
example IIp17s exploits in allegedly showing how two individuals might
share an essence: a man sharing entirely the essence of another man
whom he causes. It makes more interpretive sense to suppose that
Spinoza regards essences as particular to the individuals to which
they belong. For this reason, we might question Schliesser's claims
that knowledge of Spinozistic essences is knowledge of types, which
can in principle be multiply instantiated, rather than tokens, and
that such essences are not &ldquo;instantiated in space and
time&rdquo; (Schliesser 2014, p. 8).</p>

<p>
Moreover, we need not read the remark in Ip17s as actually endorsing
in full voice the view that two individuals can have the same essence.
Spinoza makes this remark in the context of explaining how the
intellect and will of God must differ in kind from ours. He prefaces
the remark by saying that &ldquo;what is caused differs from its cause
precisely in what it has from the cause.&rdquo; Thus the fact that a
man causes the existence of another ensures that they must disagree as
to existence. However, since he does not cause the other's essence,
the fact that he is that other's cause does not require that they
differ in essence. This is not to imply absolutely that they may have
the same essence, but only that the causal relationship between them,
as opposed to that between God and ourselves, does not itself prohibit
this.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>  Newlands (2018)
argues that it is wrong to suppose that Spinozistic individuation is
via essence.  His own view is that both what the essence of a mode is
and whether a mode is an individual are dependent on how they are
conceived.  Conceiving a mode more narrowly or broadly in terms of its
capacity to be affected and have effects delivers different verdicts
concerning what its essence is.  Conceiving it as as an isolated whole
or as being contained within any number of greater wholes delivers
different verdicts concerning whether it is an individual and whether
it is contingent or necessary.  These verdicts are, for Newlands's
Spinoza, equally legitimate, truly characterizing the mode's reality,
albeit relative to the way it is conceived.  In one statement drawing
a conclusion of his interpretation, Newlands says, &ldquo;not only
will each finite thing need to have infinitely many essences across
and within infinitely many fundamental attributes, now each one will
need to be a proper part [in a way that disqualifies it from being an
individual] of infinitely many composite individuals in each of
infinitely many attributes.&rdquo; (p. 167).  Della Rocca (1996) had
taken a similar tack with respect to the representational content of
modes of thought: their content is relative to how the mind to which
they belong is conceived. The overall strategy of Newlands's reading of
Spinoza seems to be to extend Della Rocca's approach beyond
representational content, applying it to as many vexed interpretative
problems in Spinoza as possible.  Whether or not the resulting view is
intelligible (one wants to know whose conceptual activity is supposed to
have the power to issue these essence and individuality constituting
verdicts, and Newlands's treatment of Spinozistic conceptual relations
is concededly negative and promissory), it is unclear how such
radically relativized notions of essence and individuality could
account for what I have called the &ldquo;robust persistence&rdquo; of
bodies in anything like a realistic way.</p>

<div id="note-14">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 See MacKeon (1987), Klever (1990) and Gabbey (1996) for discussions
of Spinoza's attitude towards observation and experiment, and Deleuze
(1990) on Spinoza's attitude notions of quantity, time measure and
number.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 Gabbey (1996) presents strong arguments in support of the view that
for Spinoza &ldquo;randomness&rdquo; or &ldquo;vagueness&rdquo; in
experience is not a matter of the disorderliness with which it occurs,
but of the logical status of the individual experiences on which a
judgment is based. If this is right, then we may have a conception of
<em>experientia non-vaga</em>, or <em>determinatio</em>, but not one
on which such experience could be the basis of adequate ideas.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 For further discussion of the irrelevance of observation to
scientific knowledge, especially concerning the impossibility that
anything genuinely universal (such as Newton's law of gravitation)
could be induced from observation, see Schliesser (2012a, 2012b,
2012c, 2017) and Peterman (2017a).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 It is an interesting question the extent to which developments in the
theory of transfinite numbers vitiates the reasons Spinoza had to be
suspicious of numerical treatments of the continua that are space,
time, and the limited extensive magnitudes that characterize the
existence and duration of bodies. It is also an interesting question
to what extent Spinoza's own thinking about the infinite contained
glimmers of the central insights behind those developments. See Ariew
(1990), for discussion.</p> 

</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>  Schmaltz
(2020. pp. 232<em>ff</em>) has criticized Peterman's view for ignoring
the possibility of extensive quantities that are divisible into modal,
rather than substantial, parts, and argues that Spinoza means to rule
out the latter but not the former.</p>

<h2>Texts and Authorship</h2>

<p>

Like most classical Chinese texts, the <em>Mozi</em>, our main source
for Mohist thought, originally consisted of a collection of
bamboo-strip scrolls called <em>pian</em>, or &ldquo;books,&rdquo;
each of which was itself a distinct text or series of short texts
ranging in length from several hundred to several thousand
graphs. Hence the
<em>Mozi</em> is not a single composition or work, in the modern sense,
but an anthology of diverse writings probably composed at different
times by different writers or editors. No part of the anthology
purports to be from the hand of Mo Di himself. </p>

</ul>

<h3><a name="organization">Organization of the <em>Mozi</em></a></h3>

<p>

According to a table of contents compiled during or before the Han
dynasty (206 BCE&ndash;219 CE), the <em>Mozi</em> originally consisted of
71 books, of which 18 are now lost. The 71 books fall into five groups,
which are likely of different origin. </p>

<ol>
<li>The first group consists of seven short texts on a variety of
topics, including essays summarizing Mohist doctrines, anecdotes about
Mozi, and a pair of essays that expound what are essentially mainstream
early Chinese views on self-cultivation and the value of worthy
scholar-officials. This block of texts is probably the latest part of
the corpus, dating from perhaps the mid to late 3rd century BCE (one
book mentions the fall of a king known to have died in 286 BCE (Lau
1963)).</li>

<li>The second group is the core of the collection, comprising ten
&ldquo;triads,&rdquo; or sets of three essays expounding the
 <a href="index-2.html#doctrines">ten main doctrines</a>
 of the Mohist
school, plus two further books containing criticisms of the <em>Ru</em>
(Confucians), some of them perhaps stock rebuttals used in debates (and
all of them hostile, descending at times to petty slander). Of these 32
texts, seven of the triad essays and one of the anti-Confucian books
are now lost. This block of texts probably contains the earliest parts
of the corpus, perhaps from Mozi&rsquo;s lifetime or shortly after his
death around the end of the 5th century BCE. The essays appear to be of
varied date and origin, however, and linguistic, formal, and thematic
evidence suggests that they fall into several chronologically distinct
strata. One clue to their dates is that Book 18, which falls within a
relatively early stratum, must have been written after 431 BCE, since
it mentions a war that occurred that year (Graham, 1989). A further
clue is that Book 19, which falls within a middle stratum, was probably
written well before 334 BCE, because in a list of warlike contemporary
states it includes Yue, which was conquered and absorbed by its enemy
Chu that year. (For further discussion of the stratification of the
triads, see
 <a href="#triads">The Ten Triads</a>.)</li>

<li>Next come six books known as the &ldquo;Later Mohist&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Neo-Mohist&rdquo; texts. These include two sets of short
&ldquo;canons&rdquo; (<em>jing</em>), two sets of longer
&ldquo;explanations&rdquo; (<em>shuo</em>) of the canons, a brief but
rich text on argumentation and logic, and a collection of fragments
from two or more lost essays on ethics and semantics. These books
treat a variety of topics, including language, epistemology,
analogical reasoning, ethics, geometry, mechanics, optics, and
economics, and are of the highest philosophical and historical
interest. Unfortunately, the texts are the most difficult and corrupt
in all the classical Chinese literature. The best editorial
reconstruction of the canons and explanations is Graham&rsquo;s
(1978), although fundamental aspects of his interpretation of the
texts are questionable (Geaney, 1999). This section of the corpus is
probably chronologically later than most of the doctrinal books. A
reasonable conjecture, based on the intellectual milieu implied by the
texts, would be that they date from the first half of the 3rd century
BCE.</li>

<li>The fourth group comprises five books that we might call the
&ldquo;dialogues&rdquo; or the Mohist &ldquo;analects.&rdquo; Four are
structured mainly as series of short conversations between Mozi and
various disciples or opponents, perhaps after the model of the
Confucian <em>Analects</em>.  The fifth relates an anecdote about Mozi
persuading the powerful ruler of Chu not to attack the weak state of
Song and then, on his journey home, being denied shelter from the rain
by the keeper of one of Song&rsquo;s city gates. These books reflect a
flourishing, well-organized Mohist group that trains students,
recommends them for government posts or dispatches them on military
assignments, and engages in spirited debates with representatives of
rival advocacy groups, such as the <em>Ru</em> (Confucians). The
writers are familiar with parts of the Confucian <em>Analects</em>,
quoting a passage thought to be from the middle strata of that
text. Their social status and intellectual environment seem more
advanced than those implied by the earliest doctrinal books. Though
any estimate of the date of these texts is speculative, a reasonable
conjecture is that they date from the middle to late decades of the
4th century BCE. It is thus likely that many of the conversations they
report are at least partly fictional.</li>

<li>The final block of 21 books is devoted entirely to military
engineering and tactics for defending cities during siege warfare. Ten
of these books are lost and others are seriously corrupt. (A partial
reconstruction is presented in Yates, 1980.) Unlike any other part of
the <em>Mozi</em>, many of these books are organized as replies by
Mozi to questions by a leading disciple, Qin Guli, who is referred to
as &ldquo;Master Qin,&rdquo; suggesting that the texts might have been
composed by his disciples and their followers.</li>
</ol>

<p>

This article focuses on aspects of Mohist thought as presented in
the core doctrinal books (the ten triads, books 8&ndash;37) and the dialogues
(books 46&ndash;49). (For more information on Later Mohist thought, see the
separate entry for &ldquo;Mohist Canons.&rdquo;)</p>

<h3><a name="triads">The Ten Triads</a></h3>

<p>

The ten triads are ten sets of three essays expounding the
 <a href="index-2.html#doctrines">ten main doctrines</a> 
of the Mohist school. At the time the <em>Mozi</em> was compiled, each
of the ten doctrines was represented by three identically titled
essays, labeled the &ldquo;upper,&rdquo; &ldquo;middle,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;lower&rdquo; parts of their respective triad. Six of the triads
have been preserved complete; four are now missing one or two
essays. The essays in the six complete triads are partly similar,
running parallel in places for several paragraphs at a time. Yet the
texts also show significant differences in language, structure, and
content. A number of theories have been proposed to explain the
significance of the three versions of each essay. The best
explanation, supported by analyses of both language and content, seems
to be that the essays belong to different chronological strata and
thus represent different stages in the development of Mohist thought
(Brooks 1996; Fraser 2010c). Later, longer essays modify and
supplement earlier, shorter ones, developing more sophisticated
doctrines, remedying weak points, addressing new issues, and
responding to objections. The different strata were probably produced
by different writers or editors, who may have belonged to the same or
different factions of the Mohist movement. However, the strata do not
coincide exactly with the division of the texts into
&ldquo;upper,&rdquo; &ldquo;middle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;lower&rdquo;
versions, so these labels do not demarcate three distinct series of
texts attributable to three different Mohist factions.</p>

<p>

For a summary of the argument for this conclusion, including a brief
critique of the most prominent competing theories, see the following
supplement:</p>

<blockquote><a href="triads.html" name="return-c">Significance and Chronology of the Triads</a></blockquote>

<h3><a name="authorship">Authorship</a></h3>

<p>

All but three of the essays in the ten triads begin with an incipit
&ldquo;Our Master Mozi states...,&rdquo; a formula used throughout the essays to
introduce key doctrinal statements. Since much of the content of the
texts is attributed to Mozi in this way, readers have traditionally
been inclined to treat them as generally reliable reports of his speech
and to regard Mozi as the author of all the ideas the texts present.
However, this interpretive approach is undermined by several
points.</p>

<p>

First, what is known of ancient Chinese writing practices suggests
that attribution of a doctrine to a historical figure in a Warring
States text is not a sufficient reason for believing that the person
actually espoused that doctrine. Most writing in pre-Han China was
anonymous, and writers commonly placed their own ideas in the mouths of
a venerated teacher or historical figure. For example, scholars have
long argued plausibly that many remarks in the <em>Analects</em>
attributed to Confucius and speeches in the <em>Guanzi</em> attributed
to Guan Zhong were actually written long after their deaths. Moreover,
existing texts were routinely rearranged, modified, and supplemented by
editors and compilers.</p>

<p>

Second, the essays in each triad sometimes present different, even
incompatible views that suggest modifications in position over time in
response to changing circumstances, challenges from opponents, and
perceived weaknesses in earlier positions. One essay in each triad is
considerably shorter than the others, which introduce and develop
issues not raised in the briefer text. Often a single thinker will
revise his views over time, of course, and it remains possible that all
the essays express the thought of one man. But on the whole the
disparities between them seem better explained by the hypothesis that
they were composed by different writers and editors working in
different social and intellectual settings. This hypothesis also best
explains significant linguistic differences between some of the essays
(for more information, see the discussion in
 <a href="triads.html" name="return-2">Significance and Chronology of the Triads</a>).</p>

<p>

Third, in some essays, a significant portion of the argument is not
attributed to Mozi at all, but presented in a narrator&rsquo;s voice,
with only occasional citations of Mozi&rsquo;s words. This raises the
possibility that the basic structure of the argument is due to the
writer or editor, and not to Mozi himself.</p>

<p>

Given these considerations, we cannot safely attribute to Mo Di
himself all of the views expressed in the core doctrinal books, nor,
<em>a fortiori</em>, those advanced in the rest of the anthology. A
more defensible stance is that the doctrinal essays collect together
texts by an unknown number of anonymous Mohist writers, which develop,
refine, or extend basic themes or ideas first set forth by Mozi. But
the available evidence is so limited that we have no rigorous way of
determining which of the detailed statements in these texts, if any,
represent Mozi&rsquo;s own views and which are extensions, revisions,
or entirely new ideas introduced by his followers. Moreover, even if we
had some reliable means of picking out the founder&rsquo;s original
statements, the other, later material might well prove to be of greater
interest.</p>

<p>

For these reasons, in interpreting and discussing the <em>Mozi</em>,
the most productive and defensible approach is probably to set aside
the issue of which parts of the corpus do or do not represent the views
of the historical Mo Di. At the same time, scholarly precision demands
that we not suggest, even indirectly, that the texts are generally an
accurate presentation of the words or views of a single great thinker
named &ldquo;Mozi,&rdquo; since historically we know this may well be false.
Accordingly, instead of discussing the ideas of &ldquo;Mozi,&rdquo; a historical
figure whose exact relation to the texts is unknown, we should discuss
the diverse, sometimes conflicting statements of &ldquo;Mohist&rdquo; doctrines,
understood to be an evolving set of views preserved in a collection of
texts probably composed by different persons over many years.</p>

<h3><a name="composition">Composition of Individual Books</a></h3>

<p>

At first glance, the core doctrinal books of the <em>Mozi</em> may
appear to be continuous, unified essays. Closer inspection, however,
suggests that many of them are highly composite texts, produced by
splicing independent short paragraphs together to form a longer whole.
An editor&rsquo;s or compiler&rsquo;s hand is readily apparent in places, such as
when semi-independent passages are integrated into a longer essay by
repeating a brief concluding formula after each. Similar paragraphs
are often reused in different books in the same or different triads
(Maeder 1992), and in a few places distinctive vocabulary strongly
suggests that different paragraphs within the same book are of diverse
origin (Fraser 2010c). It is thus probable that, like the
anthology itself, some of the individual books were not originally
written as integral works, but composed in piecemeal fashion or in
stages, the writers or compilers gradually adding new sections over
time.</p>

<h3><a name="oral">The Role of Oral Transmission</a></h3>

<p>

A common conjecture about the three series of doctrinal essays is
that they represent three separate redactions of a shared oral teaching
(Graham, 1985). Stated in this simple form, this conjecture is probably
incorrect, for three reasons. First, linguistic features indicate that
the theory that the three series are the canonical texts of three
groups of Mohists is probably mistaken (for details, see
 <a href="triads.html" name="1">Significance and Chronology of the Triads</a>).
 Second, the essays in each triad differ too extensively in structure
and content to plausibly be considered alternative versions of the
same orally transmitted teaching. In general, the three parts of each
triad are not mere variants of each other, but address different
issues and offer different arguments. Third, in some longer essays,
paragraphs that run parallel to a shorter essay alternate with other
paragraphs in which distinctive stylistic and linguistic features are
clustered (Fraser forthcoming [b]). Also, topics raised briefly in one
essay are sometimes developed at greater length in another, apparently
later one.  These patterns suggest that written versions of some of
the essays were used as sources for others in the same triad, which
supplement and expand on them.</p>

<p>

These points make it unlikely that the three essays in each triad
represent separate versions of a single, original oral teaching. The
possibility remains, however, that the essays might be jointly based on
a brief core of orally transmitted material, which was later written
down and augmented by new, written material. Traces of this oral core
might be evident in certain repetitive, formulaic passages in which two
or more of the essays run almost exactly parallel. It is also likely
that long after the Mohists adopted the practice of writing down their
doctrines, some of their compositions continued to be intended for
memorization and oral delivery, especially since some of the Mohists
and perhaps much of their audience were probably illiterate. Hence even
texts that were composed with the aid of writing may retain the
rhythmic, repetitive, formulaic structure characteristic of oral
composition and recitation.</p>

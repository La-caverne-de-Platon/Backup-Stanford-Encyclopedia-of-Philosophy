<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">The Common Good</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 In taking the common good to encompass both a set of facilities and a
set of common interests, the entry follows the general outlines of
Rawls&rsquo;s discussion (see Rawls 1971 [1999], especially
82&ndash;83, 205 and 217). Strictly speaking, Rawls uses the term the
&ldquo;common good&rdquo; to refer to a set of conditions that serve
certain common interests. But it is clear from his discussion that he
takes the common good to refer more generally to a standpoint that
encompasses both a set of conditions and a set of interests (see
section
 <a href="index-2.html#CommInteIiPrivIndi">6</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#CommGoodPersCommDist">7</a>).
 Finnis (1980) also uses the common good to refer both to a set of
facilities (in my sense) and a set of interests. Most other views do
not draw a sharp distinction between facilities and interests.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 A theory is consequentialist in this sense when it conceives of
practical reason in terms of a set of values, where there are
intrinsic, agent-neutral reasons for these values to be increased.</p>
</div>

<div>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3" id="note-3">3.</a>
 Mill&rsquo;s view raises interesting interpretative issues. Mill is
clearly a critic of &ldquo;private society&rdquo; (see
 <a href="index-2.html#WhyDoesPoliPhilNeedConcDefePrivSoci">section 3</a>)
 and he thinks that citizens have an obligation to take an interest in
public affairs. But on Mill&rsquo;s view, citizens should be oriented
towards public affairs because this orientation is part of a system of
public reasoning that experience has shown will bring citizens to
perform the actions required by the principle of utility. On
Mill&rsquo;s view, citizens do not owe it <em>to each other</em> to
take an interest in their common affairs: friendly feelings and
goodwill are useful engines for getting citizens to perform the right
actions, but these relational patterns of thought are not responding
to genuinely relational obligations. Because it lacks a principle of
reciprocity, Mill&rsquo;s view should not be understood as a common
good conception.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

 In economic theory, a public good is a desirable object, condition or
state that has the following features: (a) the process for generating
the good requires a contribution from almost everyone in society; (b)
each individual&rsquo;s contribution comes at a personal cost to her;
(c) each person would be better off paying the cost and enjoying the
good; (d) if everyone contributes to the process, everyone in society
will enjoy the good; and (e) there is no practical way to exclude
those who do not contribute from enjoying the benefit.</p>
</div>

 Worse off, that is, as compared to a baseline condition in which
there is a muffin market but no public library.</p>

<div id="note-6">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 One example of a private society is a society that operates according
to the standard economic model of rational behavior (see Rawls 1971
[1999: 457]). According to this model, each individual&rsquo;s utility
function has as variables the resources that she herself holds, but
not the resources that other people hold, the level of utility that
other people achieve, or the character of society&rsquo;s basic
institutions.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 The deepest version of the public goods argument treats institutions
themselves as public goods. Generalized compliance with institutional
rules is a public good, so this pattern of behavior will not develop
in a society where individuals take a purely instrumental attitude
towards compliance (see Olson 1965; but note the special case of a
convention&mdash;e.g., Lewis 1969). There would be no market in a
private society composed of rational egoists, that is, no pattern of
generalized compliance with the rules of private ownership and
exchange. Even ordinary communication and linguistic understanding
presupposes certain rule-governed practices. See Gauthier 1986;
Habermas 1981b; Heath 2001; see also Heath 2006.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 You could also cultivate a more dispersed pattern of socially
oriented motivations in citizens, such as an aversion to free riding,
that would stabilize mutually beneficial patterns of cooperation
whenever they arise (see Taylor 1984; see also Axelrod 1981 and 1984;
Ostrom 1990).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 A different failure kind of failure involves cases where a Supreme
Court Justice uses her position to make decisions on the basis of her
own comprehensive moral doctrine rather than a political conception of
justice, implicit in the public culture, which could properly serve as
the content of public reason in the community (see Rawls 1993). In
these cases, the withdrawal from public life consists in a failure to
reason from appropriately public standards of justification. Some
philosophers identify the common good with &ldquo;common
principles&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., shared standards and principles of
justification in a political community&mdash;rather than &ldquo;common
interests&rdquo;. This view is closely connected with a conception of
the political relationship as a relationship of mutual justification.
See the discussion of &ldquo;communal&rdquo; versus
&ldquo;distributive&rdquo; conceptions of the common good in sections
 <a href="index-2.html#CommGoodPersCommDist">7</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#CommGoodPoliDemoCollDeciMaki">8</a>.</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Philosophers have different views about how the pattern must be
realized: some argue that it must be realized in the thought process
of citizens in every walk of life (Plato <em>Republic</em>), while
others argue that the pattern need only be realized in the wider
legislative and policy debates that organize social life (e.g., Hegel
1821; Rawls 1971 and 1993).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 The privileged class includes only a subset of the interests that all
citizens share, so the mere fact that a certain interest is shared
does not imply that it belongs in the privileged class.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Perhaps the most intensely solidaristic form of mutual concern is the
form that Plato sets out in the <em>Republic</em> (462a&ndash;466d;
see also Schofield 2006: 222&ndash;7 and Vlastos 1999). Members of his
ideal community conceive of themselves as working for one
another&rsquo;s good as they play their respective roles in society as
farmers, soldiers, political officials, and so on. Moreover, they not
only identify with one another&rsquo;s good or interests, but actually
<em>feel</em> one another&rsquo;s pleasures and pains (462b&ndash;e).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 On Aristotle&rsquo;s view, citizens are not just individuals who are
each trying to live well for their own sakes. Citizens take a
particular interest in whether their <em>fellow citizens</em> are
living well, and they know that their fellow citizens take a special
interest in whether <em>they</em> are living well (Cooper 1990). So
the members of a political community strive to realize a choiceworthy
way of life in their community, both in order to live well themselves
and in order for their fellow members to do the same.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Philosophers often assume that a joint activity conception of the
common good is incompatible with liberalism. But some joint activity
conceptions may be compatible with liberal ideals. For example,
liberal neutrality says that society&rsquo;s basic institutions must
not presuppose the correctness of any particular conception of the
good or any particular comprehensive doctrine (Rawls 1993).
Aristotle&rsquo;s view is incompatible with neutrality, but a
conception that focuses on a more abstract kind of joint activity may
be compatible with this ideal. Rawls, for instance, argues that
citizens in a liberal democracy have reason to value being part of a
flourishing social life that has the structure of a &ldquo;social
union of social unions&rdquo;. They have reason to value being part of
this kind of social life, regardless of their particular conceptions
of the good (see especially 1971 [1999: 456&ndash;64]; 1988 [2005:
204&ndash;206]; 1982 [2005: 320&ndash;323]). It follows that social
institutions may be designed to allow for the development of a social
life along these lines without violating the liberal ideal of
neutrality.</p>

<p>
Rawls himself does not consider a social union of social unions to be 
part of the common good of a political community (see
 <a href="index-2.html#CommInteIiPrivIndi">section 6</a>).
 On his view, the common good consists in social conditions that
answer to the interests attached to the &ldquo;position of equal
citizenship&rdquo;, that is, the interest in an equal set of basic
liberties and the interest in a fair opportunity to reach the more
attractive positions in society. A social union of social unions does
not answer to either of these interests. Moreover, a social life that
has this structure is not mentioned in either of the two principles of
justice, so the political relationship does not require citizens to provide one
another with a form of life that has this structure. In this sense, a
social union of social unions is a good, but it is not a good that is
&ldquo;internal&rdquo; to the political relationship.</p>

<p>
Note that people may regard an ongoing enterprise&mdash;e.g., a
friendship, a university, a scientific discipline, etc.&mdash;as a
common achievement (Rawls 1971 [1999: 456&ndash;464]). They may see
the enterprise as something that they sustain with the cooperation of
other participants and something they each value as a final end. The
common achievement may then be part of the good of each participant,
and this fact may tie the participants to each other in an important
way. But the common good is a different idea and should not be
confused with this notion of a common achievement (see Hussain
forthcoming). </p>

<p>
A conception of the common good describes the distinctive way that a
certain social relationship directs people who stand in the
relationship to care about each other. It describes internal
requirements of the relationship itself. Now people who stand in a
certain relationship may find that the relationship is a common
achievement and this may give them added reason to live up to the
relevant requirements: for example, old friends may have added reason
to live up to the requirements of their friendship because their
friendship is a common achievement. Nonetheless, the common
achievement in these cases presupposes a relationship with certain
internal requirements and the common good describes an aspect of these
internal requirements.</p>

 They are, of course, free to make choices through consultation and
shared deliberation if they want to.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 For Rousseau, equality in the distribution of social and economic
resources is not so much an element of the common good, as a centrally
important factor in the ongoing stability of a pattern of social
interaction guided by a conception of the common good (see J. Cohen
2010: 51, 53, 116&ndash;118). As Joshua Cohen correctly observes in
relation to Rousseau&rsquo;s conception of the common good, &ldquo;I
see no anticipation [in Rousseau&rsquo;s view] of, say, Rawls&rsquo;s
difference principle&rdquo; (2010: 51).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Communal conceptions of the common good are especially important in
conservative thought. Adam Smith (1776), for instance, is a classical
liberal thinker who thinks of the common good in terms of a privileged
class of common interests in living virtuous, industrious and
responsible private lives. These interests require various facilities,
including protections for natural liberties (e.g., bodily integrity
and property) and an adequate system of moral and civic education
(Smith 1776 [2000: 839&ndash;846]). These interests may have certain
distributive implications, but they do not incorporate a fundamentally
distributive form of concern for individual interests (see note
18).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 A communal conception of the common good, though it is not
distributive, may nonetheless have distributive implications. This is
because the proper organization of the collective effort by citizens
to maintain certain social conditions may require a particular
distribution of social resources and social authority. See Finnis
1980: 165&ndash;8 and 173&ndash;5; see also Walzer&rsquo;s discussion
of longevity and health care (1983: 87&ndash;89).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Rawls also sometimes suggest a view of the principle of common
interest that incorporates distributive concerns. For instance, in a
widely cited passage, he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;it is a political convention of a democratic society to appeal
to the common interest. No political party publicly admits to pressing
for legislation to the disadvantage of any recognized social group.
But how is this convention to be understood? &hellip;Since it is
impossible to maximize with respect to more than one point of view, it
is natural, given the ethos of a democratic society, to single out
that of the least advantaged and to further their long-term prospects
in the best manner consistent with the equal liberties and fair
opportunity. (1971 [1999: 280&ndash;281])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Rawls is interpreting a feature of democratic practice and
arguing that the difference principle can be seen as a reasonable
interpretation of this feature. But he is not offering a definition of
the principle of common interest or of the common good. He defines
these ideas in other passages (e.g., 1971 [1999: 82&ndash;83,
217]).</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Speech Acts</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
In his <em>The A Priori Foundations of the Civil Law</em> (1913),
the Austrian jurist Adolf Reinach developed what he termed a theory of
&ldquo;social acts&rdquo; prefiguring many of the themes of later
Anglo-American work on speech acts. For an appraisal see Mulligan
1987. See also K. Schuhmann and B. Smith 1991 for a discussion of
some elements of speech act theory in the thought of Thomas Reid. Smith
1990 offers a more general historical survey. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
See Gorman 1999, however, for a detailed account of how literary theory
has appropriated a distorted view of speech acts. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a> In what follows I shall
use &lsquo;utterance&rsquo; to refer to any production by an agent of
meaningful words. Uses of Nicaraguan Sign Language, Morse Code, and
my repetition of words I overhear from another language but do not
understand all count as utterances on this permissive criterion.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a> The term
&lsquo;performative&rsquo; has been appropriated in fields outside
Philosophy. For instance, social scientists sometimes describe
utterances as performative on the ground that they &ldquo;enact the
events they describe&ldquo; (Callon 2006). &lsquo;Leading economic
indicators are positive,&rsquo; when spoken by the U.S. Federal
Reserve can help to ensure that such indicators are
positive. Notwithstanding the interest of the phenomenon, this usage
would also treat &lsquo;This sentence is true&rsquo; as performative,
and likewise for &lsquo;I am whispering,&rsquo; when said in
whisper. To avoid confusion we will not adopt this inclusive
usage. See Callon (2006) and Miller (2007) for further discussions of
performativity conforming to this usage.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a> In that same article,
Searle notes Austin&rsquo;s definition of &lsquo;rhetic act&rsquo; as an
utterance of words with a definite sense and reference. He then points
out that Austin&rsquo;s examples of indirect reports of rhetic acts
generally contain illocutionary verbs, such as we find in &lsquo;He
told me to get out,&rsquo; and &lsquo;He asked whether it was in
Oxford or Cambridge.&rsquo; Searle concludes that all rhetic acts are
therefore illocutionary acts. Unfortunately, this conclusion depends
on an over-generalization from the cases Austin considers. Another
perfectly adequate report of a rhetic act is simply, &lsquo;She said
that she would be more punctual in the future.&rsquo; In this case, we
have no idea whether the speaker is being described as predicting or
promising or just practicing lines from a play. Searle&rsquo;s conclusion
(1968, p. 413) that all rhetic acts are also illocutionary acts is
thus unwarranted by his argument on its behalf.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a> The absurdity that these sentences exhibit is often disclosed under the rubric of Moore&rsquo;s Paradox, for further discussion see Green and Williams 2007.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a> K&#246;nig and Seimund
(2007) provide an extensive cross-linguistic study of the interaction
of illocutionary force with grammatical mood.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a> See the essays collected
in Warnock 1973 for speculation about Austin&rsquo;s research plans that
were tragically cut short by his early death.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a> The characterization is
thus analogous to the way in which some non-classical logical theories
describe some proposition as being neither True nor False, but as
having a third truth value, <em>N</em>: Evidently that is not to say
that such propositions are bereft of truth value. It is difficult to
discern from such accounts how one sheds light on a speech act in
characterizing it as having a null direction of fit, as opposed to
having no direction of fit at all. See Humberstone 1992 for a fuller
discussion of the notion of direction of fit. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a> In his groundbreaking
discussion of implicature, Grice (1989) appears to treat
conversational implicata as cases of speaker meaning. This might
encourage the view that what is implicated must also be a speech
act. It may well be that some implicata area also
illocutions. However, many are not. If A asks B, &ldquo;Where is
C,&rdquo; and B replies, &ldquo;Downtown somewhere,&rdquo; B may well
be indicating that she is not in a position to be any more specific
about C&rsquo;s whereabouts. However, it is doubtful that she is asserting
that she is in no such position. After all, if B did know precisely
where in Downtown C is, she would be misleading in responding to A as
she did, but she would not be a liar. By contrast, one who asserts
something she does not believe to be true has lied. Accordingly,
understanding indirect speech acts in terms of implicature does not
guarantee that they will turn out to be illocutions after all. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a> Millikan writes,
&ldquo;Natural conventionality is composed of two, quite simple,
related characteristics. First, natural conventions consist of
patterns that are &ldquo;reproduced&rdquo; in a sense to be
defined. Second, the fact that these patterns proliferate is due
partly to the weight of precedent rather than due, for example, to
their intrinsically superior capacity to perform certain
functions. That is all.&rdquo; (1998, p. 162) </p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a> I take it that the
&ldquo;certain condition&rdquo; Searle refers to in the passage quoted
can be specified without his claim becoming trivial.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a> This terminology is
misleading because according to philosophers&rsquo; usage, an act can be one
of speaker meaning with no sounds uttered or even any inscriptions
made. For instance two hunters with no common language might
communicate with pantomime, so that when one acts out the path of
attack he means, in the sense of speaker meaning, that the other is to
approach the mammoth from behind. In spite of the misleading nature of
the jargon of speaker meaning I shall retain it rather than introduce
new nomenclature.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a> It may be that adults who seem to address pre-linguistic infants are only making as if to speaker-mean things to them, and are instead addressing themselves. It would appear that only in some cases are those adults harboring reflexive-communicative intentions toward themselves. We observe here also that Armstrong 1971 offers an account of speaker meaning in terms of objectives
rather than intentions, his reason being that the latter notion is
narrower than the former. One who intends a certain result must
believe that the thing aimed at is within her power, while one who has
that result as an objective need not do so. Presently we shall show an
affinity between Armstrong&rsquo;s position and that offered below. However,
just replacing &lsquo;intention&rsquo; with &lsquo;objective&rsquo; in
Grice&rsquo;s account will not deal with the cases we have considered. It is
not part of my objective to produce an effect in my newborn daughter
in uttering the last line of Spinoza&rsquo;s <em>Ethics</em>. Similarly it
need be no part of the objective of the framed suspect in maintaining
her innocence to produce effects on her interrogators. Instead she may
say what she does in order to make public, for anyone who may be
concerned with the matter, her avowal of innocence. Her objective is
simply to establish a pattern of consistently maintained
innocence.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a> Following a suggestion
of Schiffer (1972, p. 15), Strawson (1970, p. 7), and Bennett (1976,
p. 271), Avramides 1989 proposes in response to these kinds of case
that the speaker is addressing himself, intending in particular to
produce a certain cognitive effect in himself. While it may be that in
the newborn daughter case the speaker is
addressing himself, it neither follows, nor does it seem true, that in
those cases the speaker is intending to produce any cognitive effect
in himself. We sometimes address ourselves in order to
produce a cognitive effect: &lsquo;I can do it!&rsquo; as I sprint up
the steep road, or &lsquo;945&ndash;6743, 945&ndash;6743&rsquo; as I try to
internalize a phone number I just got out of the phone book. However,
I already believe that all things valuable are difficult as they are
rare. In fact it is a belief I have held firmly since encountering it
in Spinoza two decades ago, and I actively believe it as I reflect
upon the number of diapers I will have changed by the time I am
forty. As a result it is quite unclear what cognitive effect I might
be trying to produce in myself in saying what I do. His own eyes have
already done that for him. Likewise it is far from clear what belief
the framed suspect might be trying to produce or strengthen or
activate in herself as she maintains her innocence. The suspect knows
perfectly well that she has never set foot in the part of town in
which the crime was committed, and that she has no idea how to use the
garotte with which the victim was killed. (Avramides&rsquo; discussion here
is confusing because she first responds to a case, due to Harman, of a
person maintaining a proposition in full knowledge that no one will
believe him, with the words, &rsquo;I think that in Harman&rsquo;s case the
speaker is not really speaking to an audience at all&rsquo; (p. 64). But
then two pages later Avramides writes, &lsquo;The misleading thing
about Harman&rsquo;s case is that there appears to be an audience
present. The speaker, however, does not really address his utterance
to those present &hellip;. If this is true, why not say that in such
cases the speaker intends his audience to be himself &hellip;&rsquo;
(p. 66). I shall take Avramides to hold the view that in these cases
the speaker <em>does</em> have an audience, namely himself.)
</p>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a> Hajdin 1991 argues that
attending to illocutionary force and semantic content is insufficient
to account for the meaning of even paradigm speech acts such as
promising. His reason is that one can know that a promise that agents
A and B will not, say hold hands, has been made, without knowing who
is responsible for ensuring that that promise is carried out. (It
might be A, B or a third party.) However, even if it is true that
specifying a &ldquo;force/content pair&rdquo; is insufficient to
answer this question, it does not follow, and is not true, that such
facts about responsibility are aspects either of what is meant or how
it is meant.</p>

<div id="note-17">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
See the essays collected in Parrett and J. Verschueren 1992.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a> Artificial Intelligence
research has employed the tools of speech act theory to help automated
systems determine the plans of human agents. Prominent examples are
the chapters in Cohen, Morgan and Pollack 1990, and Shoham 1993.</p>
</div>


<div id="note-19">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a> Adapted from Green
2000. An argument is illocutionarily sound just in case it is both
illocutionarily valid and all its premises are such that their
conditions of satisfaction are met. A fuller account of illocutionary
validity would employ further distinctions. For example, two
assertoric commitments may be alike save for differing in strength;
these differences are usually described as differences in subjective
probability, which could be represented as differences in the strength
of commitment. Again, we could distinguish among the different
possible objects of commitment, since there is nothing to rule out
being committed to a question or to an imperative. These distinctions
within the dimension of mode, strength and object of commitment are
taken into account in Green 2000. See also Harrah (1980, 1994) for a
discussion of assertoric, erotetic, and projective commitment. Observe
also that the truth-preservation notion of validity may be seen as a
special case of the commitment-preservation notion as follows: Treat
each of the sentences in the argument counting as valid in the former
sense as being put forth in assertoric mode, and treat each such
sentence as declarative. Illocutionary validity is thus not a rival to
the truth-preservation notion, but is instead a generalization
thereof.</p>

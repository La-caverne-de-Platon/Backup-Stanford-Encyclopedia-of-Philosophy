<h2>Peirce's View of the Relationship Between His Own Work and German Idealism</h2>

<p>Peirce&rsquo;s own ultimate philosophical position, as claimed by his own
self-description of his most mature thinking, had much in common with
the transcendental idealism of Kant. In 1905, for example, Peirce
writes: &ldquo;The present writer [i.e. Peirce himself] was a pure
Kantist until he was forced by successive steps into Pragmaticism. The
Kantist has only to abjure from the bottom of his heart the
proposition that a thing-in-itself can, however indirectly, be
conceived; &hellip;&thinsp;.&rdquo; Again in 1905, in connection with
a series of four papers of 1905 and 1906 published in <em>The
Monist</em> in connection with pragmaticism, Kantianism, and
common-sensism, Peirce wrote in the voice of the pragmatist:
&ldquo;Kant (whom I <em>more</em> than admire), is nothing but a
somewhat confused pragmatist.&rdquo; (<em>CP</em>, 5.525) Again,
&ldquo;&hellip; in half a dozen ways the <em>Ding an sich</em> has
been proved to be nonsensical.&rdquo; (<em>CP</em>, 5.525) Again,
&ldquo;The <em>Ding an sich</em>, however, can neither be indicated
nor found. Consequently, no proposition can refer to it, and nothing
true or false can be predicated of it. Therefore, all reference to it
must be thrown out as meaningless surplusage.&rdquo; (<em>CP</em>,
5.525) Again, &ldquo;His [i.e. Kant&rsquo;s] limitation of them [i.e. space,
time, and the twelve categories] to possible experience is
pragmaticism in the general sense.&rdquo; (<em>CP</em>, 5.525). One
should, of course, hasten to note here that any philosophical elements
that Peirce and Kant have in common certainly do not include Kant&rsquo;s
purely <em>a priori</em> philosophical methodology or Kant&rsquo;s
insistence on the essentially Euclidean nature of space. But Peirce
continued well past 1905 to consider his own position to have strong
similarities to the views of Kant. In his letter to Victoria Lady
Welby of May 20, 1911, Peirce continues the theme of the essential
correctness, in his opinion, of Kant&rsquo;s transcendental idealism:
&ldquo;I show just how far Kant was right, even when right twisted up
on formalism. It is perfectly true that we can never attain knowledge
of things as they are. We can only know their human aspect. But that
is all the universe is for us.&rdquo; Thus, by later in his career
Peirce seems to have come to realize that the special kind of idealism
that Kant espoused was not everywhere opposed to the kind of
empiricism that he himself, as a pragmatist, avowed. Nevertheless,
Peirce continued to disagree strongly with particular aspects of the
Kantian philosophy. For example, by 1892, in his <em>The Monist</em>
paper entitled &ldquo;The Doctrine of Necessity Examined,&rdquo; he
had come to consider as false Kant&rsquo;s understanding of the crucial
category of causation: &ldquo;I believe I have thus subjected to fair
examination all the important reasons for adhering to the theory of
universal necessity, and have shown their nullity&rdquo; (<em>CP</em>,
6.65). Again, in the just-cited letter to Lady Welby of May 20, 1911,
Peirce wrote, &ldquo;&hellip; the universe is not governed by
immutable law. The proof of this is surprisingly simple. Namely, I
show that if precisely the same consequence always resulted from the
same cause, there could be no real progress. Now there is real
progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

Perhaps surprisingly, Peirce ultimately came to regard his views as
even closer to those of the absolute idealists Schelling and Hegel
than to those of Kant. For example: &ldquo;I am a Schellingian of some
stripe,&rdquo; he wrote (<em>CP</em>, 6.605; see also <em>CP</em>,
6. 102). By 1892 Peirce wrote: &ldquo;My philosophy resuscitates
Hegel, though in a strange costume&rdquo; (<em>CP</em>, 1.42). Again,
about 1905, he wrote: &ldquo;The truth is that pragmaticism is closely
allied to the Hegelian absolute idealism, from which, however, it is
sundered by its vigorous denial that the third category &hellip;
suffices to make the world &hellip;&thinsp;.&rdquo; (<em>CP</em>,
5.436). Peirce&rsquo;s assimilating his late philosophy to that of the
absolute idealists, however, is not quite as straightforwardly
understandable as his finding his views similar to Kant&rsquo;s: his
explicitly given reasons for the assimilation are not always easy to
understand. Here they will be touched upon only very briefly; they
obviously require a great deal of interpretation and elaboration.</p>

<p>

In the first place, a main reason that Peirce saw his own views as
akin to those of Schelling and Hegel concerns Peirce&rsquo;s embracing,
after the death of his father Benjamin, a special form of
psycho-physical metaphysical monism that is akin to the metaphysical
views of his father; Peirce also seems to think that this monism is
akin to the views of the absolute idealists. In a paper entitled
&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s Glassy Essence,&rdquo; published in 1892 (<em>CP</em>,
6.238&ndash;6.271), Peirce put forward the monistic conjecture that
cytoplasm is some sort of substance that is halfway between the two
extremes of mind and matter. This single substance of Peirce&rsquo;s
metaphysical monism, Peirce seems to associate with with objective
idealists, especially with the <em>Geist</em> of Hegel. </p>


<p>

In the second place, from his earliest published writings in 1868
Peirce rejected not only Cartesianism but indeed also any form of
foundationalism in epistemology, that is to say any position that
takes some fixed type of cognitions to be absolutely basic and thus to
be absolutely prior to or beyond all empirical and philosophical
inquiry. (See, for example, <em>CP</em>, 5.213&ndash;5.263,
<em>CP</em>, 5.264&ndash;5.317, and <em>CP</em>,
5.318&ndash;5.357.) In this respect Peirce&rsquo;s position is akin the the
anti-foundationalism of Hegel, who in the section
&ldquo;Sense-Certainty&rdquo; of his <em>Phaenomenologie des
Geistes</em> likewise rejected any form of epistemic foundationalism,
especially any form based on Cartesian or Berkeleyan phenomenalism.
For both Peirce and Hegel, philosophy can begin, and indeed must
begin, wherever it happens to find itself, not at some
previously-picked beginning point. It is partly for this very reason
that Peirce steadily rejected Kant&rsquo;s claim about the <em>a priori</em>
status of space and time, and that, along with Karl Friedrich Gauss,
he regarded the structure of physical space and time as an empirical
inquiry. (See Peirce&rsquo;s <em>Reason and the Logic of Things</em>.) It is
for this same reason that Peirce rejected the <em>a priori</em> status
of Kant&rsquo;s twelve categories, and ultimately (as was mentioned) even
came to the conclusion that some of them, like the universal principle
of causation, were false considered as basic principles of nature. (As
did Heinrich Boltzmann, Peirce came to hold that in the place of the
principle of universal causation, some sort of principle involving
objective &ldquo;chance,&rdquo; that is to say objective randomness,
is needed as an objective feature of the physical world.)</p>

<p>

In the third place, Peirce was impressed by the similarity between his
own views and Hegel&rsquo;s picture of the fluidly unending phenomenology of
spirit. Hegel, like Peirce, denied that the job of philosophy and of
science could ever come to a fixed, final position. For Hegel,
<em>every</em> intellectual position has its own inner contradictions,
which propel <em>Geist</em> forward to overcome them and hence to
achieve a new position in which they are superseded
(<em>aufgehoben</em>).  In this way, spirit is self-correcting, just
as Peirce thinks the scientific method is self-correcting. For Hegel,
then, <em>everything</em> is <em>always</em> open to the
investigations of spirit; everything is open to revision by
intellectual criticism. The meaning for Hegel of <em>absolutes
Wissenschaft</em> is not any absolutely fixed starting point or any
absolutely fixed final position: it is rather simply the ultimate
realization that the investigations of science and philosophy can
begin anywhere and never can end. This Hegelian view is virtually
identical with the so-called epistemological fallibilism (more on
which later in this essay) that occupied such a prominent position in
Peirce&rsquo;s thinking. For Peirce, <em>every</em> intellectual position is
open to criticism and further investigation. Thus for both Peirce and
Hegel there is <em>no</em> final, fixed intellectual position free
from any potential for being revised; and the processes of revision
are in the long run self-correcting.
</p>

<p>

In the fourth place, there is a connection between the mature Peirce
and Hegel that was repeatedly cited by Peirce but is not easy to
grasp: As Peirce expressed the point: &ldquo;I am myself a scholastic
realist of a somewhat extreme stripe.&rdquo; (<em>CP</em>, 5.470). The
analysis and evaluation of this connection can only be hinted at here
because it involves a plethora of complicated notions as well as a
wide variety of points that are debated by scholars. Peirce, namely,
regarded himself in his mature years as a "Scotistic realist" in
connection with ideas; in fact, he saw himself as even a purer realist
than Duns Scotus himself had been. He was, we might say, an
<em>ultra-</em>Scotist, where the word <em>ultra</em> here is taken in
its exact Latin sense of <em>beyond</em>.  Furthermore, Peirce tended,
so he felt, to go beyond Scotus in somewhat the same way that Hegel
did. That is to say, Peirce regarded Hegel and himself along with
Hegel as more rigorous and thoroughgoing Scotistic realists than even
Scotus himself; and he saw himself as even more of a realist than
Hegel.  What exactly these opinions of Peirce mean is not without
obscurity. For Scotus the universal was to be characterized as
<em>unum in multis et de multis</em>. That is to say: the universal
was something that somehow resided <em>in</em> the individual entity
(the <em>suppositum</em>) as part of its reality and yet also was
something predicable <em>of</em> the individual entity as part of the
grammar of philosophical language. This dual character of the
universal, which is obviously quite difficult to grasp, was the
central defining characteristic of the view of the universal for the
Scotistic realist. For Peirce, however, ultra-Scotistic realism seems
to mean something somewhat different: it meant the doctrine of the
reality of what Peirce called &ldquo;thirds&rdquo;: habits,
tendencies, lawlike behavior, meanings, representations, and various
forms of metaphysical (as opposed to purely logical) necessity. Peirce
considered himself in his later years as approximating Hegel about the
reality of thirds, with two differences: first, that for Hegel thirds
involved invariant laws, whereas for himself thirds merely involved
habits; and second, that for Hegel thirds constituted the whole of
reality, whereas for himself thirds needed to be supplemented with
something else, &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; and &ldquo;seconds.&rdquo;</p>

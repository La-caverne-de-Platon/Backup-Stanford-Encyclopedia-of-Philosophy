<h1>Why Philosophy Needs a Dynamic Encyclopedia of Philosophy</h1>

<h2><a name="Intro">Introduction</a></h2>
 
<p>
 At the Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), we
have developed a solution to the problem of updating encyclopedias,
namely, a &lsquo;dynamic&rsquo; encyclopedia that is published on the
Internet.  Unlike static encyclopedias (i.e., encyclopedias that will
become fixed in print or on CD-ROM), a dynamic encyclopedia allows
entries to be updated, thereby becoming <em>responsive</em> to new
research and advances in the field.  A dynamic encyclopedia gives the
authors direct electronic access to their entries and the means to
update them whenever it is needed, and it does this without
compromising the quality of the entries.  Whereas static encyclopedias
must publish supplements or an entire new edition to become current, a
dynamic encyclopedia simply <em>evolves</em> and quickly adapts to
reflect advances in research.  The process of updating an encyclopedia
never ceases, and the very concept of a dynamic encyclopedia takes
account of this fact.</p>

 <p> 
The <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> is our working
prototype of a dynamic encyclopedia.  This prototype implements the
technical specifications developed in the paper &lsquo;A Solution to the
Problem of Updating Encyclopedias&rsquo;, which was coauthored by Eric
Hammer and Edward N. Zalta (<em>Computers and the Humanities</em>,
Volume 31/1, 1997, pp. 47-60).</p>

 <p> 
We are now working towards the goal of turning this working prototype
into a <em>mature</em> dynamic encyclopedia that will be useful both
to professional scholars and the general public.  It will not be a
&lsquo;finished&rsquo; product because dynamic encyclopedias are never
finished.  But within a few years, we will have refined the operation
of this new and innovative kind of dynamic reference work so that it
will continue to prove its worth far into the future.  We believe that
the principles upon which our encyclopedia is based will contribute to
a reconceptualization the nature of reference works for the age of the
Internet.</p>

<h2><a name="Basic">Basic Description</a></h2>

<p>
 To implement our dynamic encyclopedia, we connected a multi-user Unix
workstation (plato.stanford.edu) to the Internet and installed a World
Wide Web server.  We then created a cover page, a table of contents,
an editorial page, and a directory entitled <em>entries</em> accessible
to the web server.  We recruited (and are still recruiting) Editorial
Board members for the job of identifying topics, soliciting authors,
and reviewing the the entries and updates when they are received.
These Board members have begun recruiting authors who have a strong
interest in and commitment to the topics on which they write and who
will be motivated to keep their entries abreast of the latest advances
in research.</p>

<p>
 However, the innovative technical feature of our encyclopedia is
that authors are given a "file-upload" account on plato.stanford.edu,
i.e., the computer that runs the encyclopedia's World Wide Web server.
Once an Editorial Board member decides on a topic and finds or
approves an author to write it, he or she then forwards the
information (via email) to the Editor of the encyclopedia, who then
creates a file-upload account for the author on plato.stanford.edu and
sends the author detailed information on how to prepare the entry and
upload the entry (or update) when it is ready.  When an author uploads
an entry or an update (using a web browser) to his or her private
directory on plato.stanford.edu, only the editorial staff can view it
(they have password protected access).  The Editorial Board member
responsible for that entry is automatically notified that the entry
has been put online or changed.  The Board member then inspects the
new material, and if he/she approves it, the new material is then
published in public webspace; otherwise, the author is sent
suggestions for improvements (and in some cases, the entries must be
rejected and a new author must be commissioned).</p>


<h2><a name="Innov">Innovative Features</a></h2>

<p>
 The most obvious innovative feature of an encyclopedia fitting this
description is that it will not go out of date.  When new ideas are
published in books and journals of philosophy, the authors of our
encyclopedia can summarize the ideas and update their entries. Since
the encyclopedia will be accessible to web-browsers such as Netscape
or Internet Explorer, a wide audience (academics, students, and the
general public) may become informed of the latest advances in thought
more quickly.  We believe that this will speed up the dissemination of
new philosophical ideas to a wide audience.</p>

<p>
 The other innovative features of a dynamic encyclopedia that has been
organized on the above plan are:</p>

 <ol>
  <li>The entries in a dynamic encyclopedia can be <em>improved</em>
and <em>refined</em> over the course of time.  As Board members and
colleagues read the entry and give the author feedback, the author can
enhance the article to make it more readable, make it more logical in
form, repair typographical errors, etc.</li>
  <li>The encyclopedia eliminates the often large span of time that
appears between productions of large-scale &lsquo;static&rsquo;
encyclopedias.  The Macmillan <em>Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em>
(edited by Paul Edwards) was published in 1967.  The Routledge
<em>Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> (edited by Edward Craig) will come
out in 1998.  During the 30 year gap, no up-to-date full-scale
encyclopedia has been available.  In 2003, when the Routledge
Encyclopedia starts to show a few signs of going out of date, ours
will still be current.  In 2008, the differences will be even more
striking.</li>
  <li>The encyclopedia eliminates the lag time between the writing and
publication of the entries.  There won't be the usual two year delay
between the time the article is written and the time the encyclopedia
is published.  Some of the articles written for the forthcoming
Routledge Encyclopedia will already be several years old when they
appear in print in 1998.</li>
  <li>The encyclopedia can be expanded indefinitely; there is no
limit to its inclusiveness or size.  New or previously unrecognized
topics within a given discipline can be included as soon as they are
discovered and judged to be important.</li>
  <li>For certain controversial topics, the encyclopedia can include
more than one entry on a single topic, each one representing a
different point of view.  This feature reduces the bias that affects
other encyclopedias.  The forthcoming Routledge Encyclopedia, by
contrast, will contain just a single entry on each topic.  Biases of
the author may sometimes go unremarked and unsophisticated readers
will be unaware of the alternative point of view.  We are in a
position to publish two or more entries on controversial topics in the
philosophy of mind, medical ethics (euthanasia, abortion), political
philosophy, etc.</li>
  <li>Not only will the Bibliography sections be up to date when
entries first come online (since there is no lag time between the
writing and publication of the entry), but also, for the first time,
encyclopedia entries can be accompanied by more comprehensive
bibliographies.  Print- and CD-ROM-based encyclopedias have a fixed
amount of space to publish bibliographies and so the authors can list
only a small number of first-rank articles in the field.  Our authors
can give a complete listing of first-rank articles and books.  If the
list proves to be overwhelming, they can further divide the list into
first-rank articles and books that must be read and those that should
be read.  If the list of first-rank articles and books is not
overwhelming, the author may develop a more inclusive bibliography.
The bibliographies of our entries will therefore become <em>the</em>
place to look for references to a given philosophical topic.  We
expect our authors to update their bibliography once a year.</li>
  <li>The encyclopedia will have an <em>automatic</em>
cross-referencing system.  When new entries come online, the keywords
in the section &lsquo;Related Entries&rsquo; will be automatically
linked to the other entries in the Encyclopedia and the keyword in the
other entries referring to the new entry will be linked to the new
entry.</li>
  <li>The encyclopedia will include not only internal links that
cross-reference the entries, but each entry will contain
<em>updatable</em> external links in a special section called
&lsquo;Other Internet Resources&rsquo;.  The authors may judge which
other Internet sites are worthy of being linked into this section of
their entry.  For example, Andrew Irvine's entry on Bertrand Russell
has both internal and external links.  In the section &lsquo;Other
Internet Resources&rsquo; in this entry, there are links to the online
Russell Archives at McMaster University, the Bertrand Russell Society
web page, the web page of the Bertrand Russell Editorial Project, etc.
<em>These updatable links cannot be included in print- or CD-ROM-based
encyclopedias</em>, much less be maintained and kept up to date.  The
entry on Russell in the forthcoming Routledge Encyclopedia will lack
such connections to these invaluable Internet resources!</li>
  <li>The internet format avoids most of the expenses of production
and distribution connected with a major reference work.  It eliminates
many of the expenses of producing a printed document or CD-ROM:
typesetting, copy-editing, printing, and distribution expenses are no
longer necessary.  We provide authors with an HTML template so that
they can easily typeset their entries in HTML using an HTML-editor
such as Netscape Navigator Gold (there are now over 10 such
HTML-editors on the market, many of which are free for academic
 use).<sup>[<a href="#1" name="n1">1</a>]</sup> 
 The editing will be done collaboratively by the editorial assistants,
authors, board members, and Editor as a routine function of the
quality control systems.</li>
  <li>A dynamic encyclopedia can change in response to new technology
as new tools and languages develop.  For example, if Java becomes more
widespread, Encyclopedia entries on neural nets, turing machines,
prisoner's dilemmas, evolutionary game theory, etc., can include
demonstrations and &lsquo;applets&rsquo; that the user of the
Encyclopedia can download to learn interactively the concepts being
discussed.</li>
  <li>Statistics software can process the information in the access
log of the encyclopedia web server and identify which sites users
access it from, which entries they access most, <em>which topics they
search for</em>, etc.  Such information can help inform decisions
about which entries to add, where to advertise, etc.  This information
is absolutely invaluable to the editors of an encyclopedia, and yet,
no such access statistics can be maintained for static encyclopedias.
Since numerous copies of static encyclopedias exist, there is no way
to track the frequency individual entries are read.  Our access log,
which excludes the accesses by our own computers and recognizable WWW
indexing worms, indicates that just in the period from September 15,
1996 to September 20, 1997, there were over 19,000 accesses from the
U.S. educational (edu) domain, over 24,000 from the commercial (com)
domain, over 1000 from the U.S. government (gov) domain, over 300 from
the U.S. military (mil) domain, close to 20,000 from the network (net)
domain, and over 1000 from the non-profit organization (org) domain
(another 27,000 accesses were unresolved).  These logs also show that
during that same period, the Encyclopedia has been accessed from over
90 different countries, that Andrew Irvine's entry on Bertrand Russell
has been accessed nearly 10,000 times, and that our encyclopedia has
recently started to average over 8000 accesses per week. (See the
Recent Access Statistics page (General Statistical Summary for the
period of September 15, 1996 -- September 20, 1997), which is linked
into the Editorial Information page of the Encyclopedia.)</li>
 </ol>

<p>
 No print or CD-ROM based edition of an encyclopedia has the above
features and this includes the Routledge Encyclopedia forthcoming in
1998.</p>

<h2><a name="Future">Future Significance</a></h2>

<p>
 What is the future significance of this project, in the context of
present availability of encyclopedias in philosophy?  In 1998, we will
see the publication of a major new reference work, the vast Routledge
Encyclopedia of Philosophy.  A new supplementary volume for 1967
Macmillan Encyclopedia was released last year.  At least ten other
reference works in philosophy have been released 
 recently.<sup>[<a href="#2" name="n2">2</a>]</sup>
 It might seem, then, that the reference needs of philosophers are
well-served, and that there is little need for the project of an
online Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</p>

<p>
 This is not so, however.  The last major, comprehensive encyclopedia
before Routledge's was the 1967 Macmillan Encyclopedia.  Even in a
relatively slow moving field such as philosophy, 30 years is a long
time to wait between encyclopedias.  As fine as the Macmillan
Encyclopedia was, by the time it was five years old, its value as a
reference work for the philosophy profession had greatly diminished.
By the mid to late 1970s, a student might go to an encyclopedia
looking for information about the Kripke/Donnellan theory of
reference, the Lewis and Armstrong identity theories of mind, Putnam's
functionalist theory of mind, or Rawls's theory of justice and find
nothing of value in the Macmillan Encyclopedia.  So the philosophy
community went for 20 -- 25 years before the recent handbooks and
dictionaries attempted to fill the gap.</p>

<p>
 In this context, the Routledge Encyclopedia will be a welcome
addition and a wonderful new tool.  But within the next five to ten
years, it too will be out of date, along with the other reference
works in philosophy cited.  There are more professional philosophers,
more journals, more articles, more books than every before in history.
There is much valuable and interesting work being done that will be
cited in undergraduate classes long before another encyclopedia is due
on the present thirty year cycle.</p>

<p>
 Moreover, the philosophy profession cannot be confident that there
will ever be another major print encyclopedia.  The Routledge
encyclopedia represents an enormous investment.  The cost of purchase
is also enormous, about $2500 for the CD-ROM edition.  Routledge will
not be quick to replace it.  And yet even the CD-ROM technology is
already dated for reference tools. By contrast, the Internet is ideal
for reference tools, but not ideal (as far as one can see at present)
for traditional private print publishers to make money.</p>

<p> 
 Those academic disciplines deemed more scientific and essential
to national goals or business interests than philosophy will have many
more ways to subsidize their reference needs.  We believe a
partnership between CSLI and the philosophy profession to develop an
online philosophy encyclopedia represents the best chance for the
profession not to be left behind and without adequate reference tools
in the future.</p>

<p>
 Our online encyclopedia, by its nature, will never be
&lsquo;finished&rsquo;.  But we project that it will be mature, in the
sense of having virtually all presently planned entries complete, in
about four years.  Within two years thereafter, its inventory of
articles should be very close to that of the Routledge.  That means
our Encyclopedia will be available as a full-fledged alternative for
philosophy students <em>at about the time</em> that the Routledge
encyclopedia begins to show signs of age, and at a time when students
will increasingly be familiar with the web and expect to use it for
reference work.  Because of the fact that our Encyclopedia is
&lsquo;alive&rsquo;, it will stay current.</p>

<p>
 Thus, we propose not to redo the work that has already been done for
the Routledge Encyclopedia, but to to use new technology to begin
working on the next generation of reference tools for philosophers and
their students.</p>

<h2><a name="Fund">Funding the Encyclopedia</a></h2>

<p>
 Most of the effort that goes into the creation and maintenance of the
Encyclopedia will be donated by those who welcome the opportunity to
advance the serious study of their favorite topics and figures.  Our
plan is that the authors, the Board of Editors and the Advisory Board
will be unpaid (unless the Encyclopedia resolves its funding
problems).  For the foreseeable future, CSLI will provide an office
for the Encyclopedia staff and computer, backup systems, and cover
other indirect costs.  If in the future CSLI goes out of existence or
is unable to provide this support, it seems likely some other
institution could be found that would do so, either here at Stanford
or on some other campus.  The amount of space and computer power are
not that great, by the standards of late twentieth century American
academia.</p>

 <p> 
 However, we do not believe the Encyclopedia can function on a
completely volunteer basis.  At a minimum, we must pay for a part-time
Editor, part-time editorial assistants and at least one part-time
computer programmer.  Some equipment and supplies have to be purchased
and telephone and other services (e.g., networking) need to be paid
for.  We estimate costs (November 1997) as follows:</p>

 <blockquote>
1. Staff Salaries: $100,000 <br />
2. Staff Benefits: $25,000 <br />
3. Supplies, equipment, services, etc.:  $25,000 <br />
------------ <br />
4. Total: $150,000
 </blockquote>

<p>
 Print encyclopedias are funded by sales to individual and 
institutional users.  Our hope is our dynamic encyclopedia will remain 
free to all individual users.  There should be as few obstacles to the 
serious study of philosophy as possible.  We hope that the online 
encyclopedia will be available to anyone anywhere with access to the 
net.</p>

<p>
 The institutions most closely associated with users include
Philosophy departments, universities (and their libraries), and
professional organizations for philosophers (such as the APA, CPA,
AAP, etc.).  Universities should be able, in the long run, to support
online encyclopedias and other online resource materials from the same
budget lines used for print materials that now serve these purposes.
One strategy for funding the Encyclopedia would be to charge
university libraries a nominal yearly access (subscription) fee.  This
subscription fee would give computers based at those universities the
right to access the Encyclopedia.  If 1000 universities each pay
$150/year for unrestricted access to the Encyclopedia, the
Encyclopedia's projected annual budget would be covered.  The
$150/year access fee could simply represent an average---the fee could
be set so that universities with larger (smaller) budgets or student
populations pay a proportionally larger (smaller) access fee.  This
would keep the Encyclopedia free to the public.  </p>

<p> 
 However, in the short run, we do not expect to be able to tap these
resources.  Our Encyclopedia won't be mature for another 3 - 5 years.
Right now, we want University libraries to use their funds to purchase
the much anticipated Routledge Encyclopedia.  Until our encyclopedia
has matured, we will need to look elsewhere for support.</p>

<p>
 We feel that Philosophy departments and professional organizations
are natural sources of funding.  Philosophy departments differ
enormously in the amount of discretionary funds available to them,
with the mean amount extremely low.  Some departments do have such
funds, however, and a few hundred dollars from a number of such
departments could help significantly.  However, we prefer not to
approach individual departments until there is mature product that
will be useful to them.  (We might make an exception for a number of
the most well-endowed departments, some of which are represented on
our Editorial Board.)  At the startup phase, it seems more appropriate
to approach those institutions part of whose mission, or enlightened
self-interest, is to help projects like this get off the ground.
Within philosophy, this means professional organizations like the APA.
At this point, the Pacific APA and the CPA have made generous
contributions, and we have approached the Central and Eastern APA.  Of
course, a commitment at the national level would be preferable.</p>

<p>
 Among the funding sources that are not directly connected to
Encyclopedia users, we distinguish between government sources,
foundations, and businesses.  We have received a 2-year grant from the
NEH.  They will give us $120,000 to develop the Encyclopedia, to be
delivered over two years (AY 1998-99 and 1999-2000).  We will apply
for an NSF grant through the Digital Libraries II initiative.  If this
proposal proves successful, this would take care of our funding needs
until 2003, at which point the Encyclopedia will be close to
maturity.</p>

<p>
 We are just beginning to solicit funds from appropriate foundations.
The development and fund-raising staffs at CSLI and Stanford are being
most helpful in this respect.</p>

<p>
 It seems to us that Netscape, Microsoft, Yahoo, and other companies
with a stake in the future of the Internet might have multiple reasons
for investing in our Encyclopedia.  In this regard, it would be very
helpful to discover philosophers within such companies who would be
willing to help us identify and approach the relevant people with
funding authority.</p>

<p>
 (Some of these companies have been indirectly funding the
Encyclopedia for the past two years through CSLI's Industrial
Affiliates program.  
 <a href="https://www-csli.stanford.edu/">CSLI</a>
 was founded in 1983 with a grant from the Systems Development
Foundation.  These funds were exhausted long ago.  Since 1993, the
 Industrial Affiliates
 program has been the principal source of CSLI's operating budget.)</p>

<p>
 A final possibility for money from the private sector is advertising.
One can imagine tasteful and wholly appropriate links from the
Encyclopedia home page to the websites of publishers of philosophy
books.  Whether these publishers will find this to be a economical use
of their advertising budgets remains to be seen.</p>

<p>
 We would welcome comments from the APA membership on any aspect of 
fund-raising.   Anything from leads concerning fund-raising in industry 
to comments about the appropriateness of advertising would be welcome.</p>

 When using such HTML-editors, the author simply selects (highlights)
text and then uses &lsquo;menu&rsquo; functions to format the text in
various ways (such as to italicize, to put the text in a list
environment, to create a link and use the text as the label on that
link, etc).  The HTML-editor then creates the appropriate HTML code in
the underlying HTML file.

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 Even to call one&rsquo;s posits &ldquo;tropes&rdquo; is by some
considered problematic (<em>cf.</em> esp. Bacon 2011).
&ldquo;Trope&rdquo; was a label first suggested by D. C. Williams
(1997 [1953]), presumably as a joke (at least according to Bacon 2011
and Schaffer 2001). The literature is ripe with alternative labels,
including, but not limited to, <em>abstract particular</em> (Campbell
1990), <em>moment</em> (Mulligan et al. 1984), <em>mode</em> (Heil
2003), <em>qualiton</em> (Bacon 2011), <em>quality instance</em>
(Segelberg 1999 [1945,1947,1953]), <em>concrete property</em>
(K&uuml;ng 1967), <em>particular property</em> (Denkel 1996), and
<em>unit property</em> (Mertz 1996).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Near contemporaries to Williams who also posit tropes or trope-like
entities include, Cook Wilson (1926), P. F. Strawson (1959), Peter
Geach (Geach and Anscombe 1961), Guido K&uuml;ng (1967), and Nicholas
Wolterstorff (1970) (for even more examples, <em>cf.</em> Mulligan et
al. 1984: 293).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 This list of early proponents of trope-like entities could have been
made much longer. Mertz (1996) mentions, besides those already listed,
Bo&euml;thius, Avicenna, and Averro&euml;s. Mulligan et al. point to
Spinoza, Descartes, Berkeley and Hume.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Mulligan et al. (1984) also note the important influence Brentano has
had in this context, not just on Husserl, but on other students of
his, including Carl Stumpf and Alexius Meinong.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 G. F. Stout is well-known for his 1923-debate with G. E. Moore on
whether properties are particular or universal. At the time, the
general impression was that Moore turned out the &lsquo;winner&rsquo;
in that debate. But according to Fraser MacBride (2011), the
impression is in fact the opposite if the discussion is looked upon
with contemporary eyes.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Although little known by his contemporaries, Ivar Segelberg is
arguably one of the clearest examples&mdash;after Husserl&mdash;of an
early &lsquo;trope&rsquo;-theorist. Segelberg only published in
Swedish. A translation into English of his complete works did not
appear until 1999 (for a discussion of Segelberg&rsquo;s work,
<em>cf.</em> Hochberg 1999).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 More precisely, they are fact-generating unifiers or
&ldquo;intensional-determined agent combinators&rdquo; (Mertz, 2016:
xii; <em>cf.</em> also his 1996). Mertz, too, accepts universals in
addition to his tropes (or &lsquo;trope-like&rsquo;) entities.
Mertz&rsquo;s views are intriguing, but arguably too different from
those of the &lsquo;main-stream&rsquo; trope theorist for me to be
able to discuss them in depth here.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>  Ironically enough,
 Williams himself gives voice to a similar worry when he writes
 (1997[1953]: 122): &ldquo;Since there must be, for everything but the
 World All, at least something, and indeed many things, of which it is
 a proper part, everything but the World All is &lsquo;abstract&rsquo;
 in this broad sense.&rdquo; Williams does not think this unduly
 dilutes talk of tropes as &lsquo;abstract&rsquo;, though. For, he
 points out, the &lsquo;abstractness&rsquo; he talks of is a more
 &ldquo;special sort of incompleteness&rdquo; (<i>ibid.</i>). More
 precisely, the sort which pertains to the constituents&mdash;like the
 color and shape&mdash;of objects. But then, rather than informing us
 about the nature of the trope, being told the trope is
 &lsquo;abstract&rsquo; only tells us it is something out of which
 ordinary objects are &lsquo;made up&rsquo;. In this context, this is
 not telling us very much more than what we already knew or
 assumed.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Garcia finds flaws with tropes both on the modifier- and on the
module interpretation (although he seems to lean towards adopting a
modifier theory, primarily because this would allow him to treat
tropes as divine acts able to solve e.g., the problem of sustenance,
<em>cf.</em> his 2015<em>b</em>). A problem he sees with the idea that
tropes are of the module kind, is that then they must either ground
the character of the objects that have them <em>univocally</em> or
<em>equivocally</em>; both alternatives which land the trope theorist
in trouble. If character is grounded univocally, first, then the trope
and the object it characterizes &lsquo;have&rsquo; the character they
do &lsquo;in the same way&rsquo;. The problem with this view, is that
it implies a systematic duplication of character. And this is
problematic because, in the case of causation (and&mdash;in
particular&mdash;in perception), we want to avoid causal
overdetermination (<em>cf.</em> Section 4.1 for more on tropes and
causation). To say that character is grounded
<em>equivocally</em>&mdash;i.e., in different ways in the trope and in
the object which &lsquo;has&rsquo; the trope&mdash;arguably does not
improve matters much. For what does it even mean to say, e.g., that
although a mass trope and its bearer are both massive, they are
massive &lsquo;in different ways&rsquo; (Garcia 2016: 510f.)? If
tropes are modifiers, on the other hand, their nature becomes
something of a mystery. If a blueness-trope isn&rsquo;t blue, then
what is it? And how can it <em>make</em> something blue, if it
isn&rsquo;t blue? Good things about modifier tropes, according to
Garcia, is that they are better than module tropes at serving as the
powers (or dispositions) of objects (2015<em>a</em>: 639). They are
also better at playing the role of relations and of fundamental
determinables (<i>ibid.</i>). Module tropes, on the other hand, can be the
immediate objects of perception and the terms of causal relations
(something Garcia thinks modifier tropes cannot, 2015<em>a</em>: 642).
Module tropes are also clearly better suited to bundle, which means
that a module trope theory will be more ontologically parsimonious
than a modifier one (which will need a property-bearer on top of the
tropes themselves). And so on.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a> To say that the
 trope is simple in this sense is different from saying that the
 concept &lsquo;being a trope&rsquo; is primitive. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Yet, although most trope theorists seem prepared to accept that some
tropes are made up from other tropes, a majority think that, at
bottom, there are tropes that are simple also in the sense that they
have no parts, period.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Some trope theorists even sound as if they think tropes are
<em>neither</em> simple nor complex. According to e.g., Molnar (who
defends a theory according to which tropes are &lsquo;pure&rsquo;
powers) (2003: 37):</p>

<blockquote>

<p> There are metaphysical facts about properties that cannot be
fitted into a theory that recognizes the distinction between
derivative and basic properties&hellip;, and first-order and
higher-order properties&hellip; We can explain structural properties
as derivative properties, we do not have to say that they are also,
additionally, complex. The contrast between simple and complex
properties is not needed. However, I am not arguing for the view that
&lsquo;all properties are simple&rsquo;. I am rather claiming that the
distinction between simple (= lacks parts) and complex (= has parts)
does not apply at all to properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And, again (<i>ibid.</i>, 44):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Ways and modes also cannot be divided into the mereologically
molecular and the mereologically atomic. They are
neither-simple-nor-complex, in the strongest sense. They have no
proper parts and they do not even have themselves as parts. Perhaps
what puts properties, ways, and modes altogether outside the scope of
mereology is just the fact that they are dependent entities.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>  Indeed, if a theory
of states of affairs is to avoid ending up in vicious Bradleyan
regress, it must posit the state of affairs as a
third&mdash;<em>fundamental</em>&mdash;sort of thing, on top of the
substrate and universal. Other downsides to positing states of affairs
rather than tropes includes having to accept the existence of
&lsquo;mysterious&rsquo; universals (entities able to, among other
things, exist fully in more than one place at one moment in time). For
even more reasons to prefer tropes over states of affairs,
<em>cf.</em> Sect. 3 and 4 of this entry; <em>cf.</em> also Mulligan
(2006) (discussed in Hochberg 2014).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 By &lsquo;arbitrarily different relations&rsquo;, Ehring means
relations such that realization or variation of one, does not
necessitate the realization or variation of the other. And (2011:
178):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;[t]hat numerical difference and exact resemblance for tropes
are arbitrarily different relations is confirmed by the fact that
tropes can be numerically different but exactly similar or not exactly
similar to each other, and tropes can be exactly similar but identical
or numerically distinct from each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="note-15">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 Hochberg&rsquo;s argument must be kept separate from what on the
surface looks like the same argument, only delivered by Armstrong (and
which he&mdash;a bit confusingly&mdash;names &lsquo;Hochberg&rsquo;s
argument&rsquo;). Hochberg&rsquo;s argument rests on our accepting as
true the principle that logically independent atomic propositions must
have distinct truthmakers, and shows&mdash;rightly, I
believe&mdash;that the trope theorist must reject that principle.
Armstrong does not want to accept this principle in full generality,
which means that he does not regard a theory that contradicts it as
necessarily flawed. Instead, he prefers to argue &ldquo;simply from a
case&rdquo; (Armstrong 2004: 44; <em>cf.</em> also his
2005)&mdash;basically the same case as that set out by
Hochberg&mdash;to the considerably weaker conclusion that trope theory
is &ldquo;counter-intuitive&rdquo; (for a critique of
Armstrong&rsquo;s version of the argument, <em>cf.</em> Maurin
2016).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 Hakkarainen and Kein&auml;nen (2017) distinguish instead between what
they call &lsquo;ontological form&rsquo; and &lsquo;ontological
content&rsquo;. This distinction they attribute primarily to Lowe
(2006: 48). It was brought into the contemporary discussion from
Husserl by Smith (1981) and Smith and Mulligan (1983). The distinction
is presumably analogous to that between the non-logical content of a
proposition and its logical form. Ontological form is then thought of
as the form of being in general. Logical form is more restricted; it
is the form of the truth-bearers. It is not entirely clear if and how
much this distinction differs from that to which MacBride refers.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 That tropes are complex in an unobjectionable sense has been proposed
by Daniel Giberman (2014). According to him, tropes must exemplify a
particular, non-repeatable intrinsic spatial volume, spatial shape,
and temporal duration. But sizes, shapes and durations are
(particular, non-repeatable) features, which means that they, too, are
tropes. It follows that tropes are (complex) bundles with size, shape,
and duration tropes as members. Giberman admits that his view gives
rise to a <em>prima facie</em> puzzle (2014: 456-457): how can an
arbitrary trope be a bundle that contains other tropes? To dispel this
mystery, Giberman first argues that every trope is bundled with itself
and in this sense (reflexively) self-exemplifies. But then every
single trope also <em>inter</em>-exemplifies. That is, each member of
their bundle exemplifies every other member of their bundle. In fact,
Giberman thinks <em>only</em> single tropes inter-exemplify. One
reason for this is that we want to avoid ending up with an explosion
of size, shape, and duration tropes. If the exemplification of size,
shape and duration is a case of <em>inter</em>-exemplification, we get
the desired result. For now&mdash;just as in the case of
&lsquo;ordinary&rsquo; nominalism&mdash;single (and in this sense,
<em>simple</em>) entities can have multiple &lsquo;aspects&rsquo;.
That tropes are complex in this sense does not mean that the view
collapses into Quinean nominalism, however. For, Giberman argues, the
qualitative variety that the Quinean subsumes under the
&lsquo;ostrich&rsquo; approach is greater than the qualitative variety
that the &lsquo;ostrich&rsquo; trope theorist allows. More precisely,
on the latter view, the only &lsquo;aspects&rsquo; the trope is
allowed is precisely its size, shape and duration.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 Ehring thinks the best way to solve all of these problems is to adopt
<em>his</em> version of the trope view (Ehring 2011). On this view,
tropes are simple, but rather than resembling in virtue of their
primitive nature, tropes have the nature they do&mdash;and, hence,
resemble (or not)&mdash;in virtue of belonging to this or that natural
class. As this means that the grounds of their resemblance is
distinguished from the grounds of their distinctness, that tropes can
be distinct yet exactly resemble each other is no longer a reason to
think they are complex.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>  Three
clarifications: (1) all of the principles of individuation discussed
in what follows concern <em>intra-worldly</em> trope-individuation
only (a circumstance that will become relevant when we discuss
swapping and piling); (2) they all concern what explains the fact that
two tropes <em>at one moment in time</em> are distinct, and; (3) all
but PI only hold for <em>exactly resembling</em> tropes.  This latter
restriction is due to the fact that we want our principle of
individuation to allow for what seems clearly possible: distinct (and
different) tropes characterizing the same object (or, in the case of
SI, inhabiting the same spatiotemporal position).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Other reasons cited against SI include: (1) SI rules out as
impossible the existence of enduring stationary and moving tropes,
enduring time-travelling tropes, and tropes that extend over space
without having any spatial parts (all of which, according to Ehring
2011: 25ff. are possible kinds of entities); (2) Given SI, the
relation between tropes and their location either amounts to
complexity <em>in</em> the trope (which is independently problematic)
or it leads to the collapse of distinct yet exactly similar tropes or
of distinct yet co-localized tropes (Moreland 1985: 39ff.); (3) SI
entails a problematically substantial notion of space-time (Schaffer
2001: 251), and; (4) SI provides us with the means to individuate
tropes only if we assume that such a principle of individuation is
already in place (Stout 1952: 76&ndash;77).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 Campbell later (1990: 56) abandons this idea in favor of an outright
rejection of SI, mainly because he thinks it results in an
individuating condition for non-spatiotemporal individuals that would
be &ldquo;too formal to carry conviction&rdquo; (a claim that is
criticized in Schaffer 2001: 252).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 Interestingly enough, Husserl thinks what Armstrong calls
&lsquo;swapping&rsquo; is a <em>genuine</em> possibility, and
therefore presents it as a <em>positive</em> reason for positing what
he calls &lsquo;moments&rsquo; (<em>cf.</em> Denkel 1996: 173-174 for
a discussion).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>  Two things to note
here: First, that there are more ways of getting to the conclusion
that swapping is impossible than via an acceptance of the Eleatic
principle. An alternative is possibly to accept anti-Haecceitism
(<em>cf.</em> Lewis 1986), according to which there can be no purely
haecceistic differences between worlds (thanks to an anonymous
reviewer for this entry for pointing this out). The second thing to
note is that his objection can be put either in terms
of <em>object</em> swapping (the two tropes swap object), or in terms
of <em>position</em> swapping (the two tropes swap
position). Armstrong formulates the objection in terms of object
swapping, but as Ehring has pointed out (2011: 79; <em>cf.</em> also
Schaffer 2001: <em>fn.</em> 8), the objection is strenthened if
formulated in terms of position. For, to rule out object swapping, all
you need to do is add that tropes, besides being primitively
individuated, are &lsquo;non-transferable&rsquo; in the sense that
they must belong to some <em>specific</em> object. But this does not
solve the problem with position swapping. For, even if tropes are
non-transferable in that sense, two exactly similar objects, including
the tropes that make them up, could still swap position with the same
presumably problematic result.</p>

 Proponents of tropes that accept the existence of universals <em>as
well as</em> tropes include Husserl (2001[1900/1913]) and, more
recently, Lowe (2006).</p>

 A third possibility is to regard exact resemblance as a
<em>non-relational tie.</em> But this view has not been explicitly
defended by any trope proponent and it has been criticized by some
trope critics. Hochberg (1988: 189f.) argues that it lends all of its
support from a supposed analogy with the view that the exemplification
which holds a substrate and a universal together in a state of affairs
is a non-relational tie, but that this analogy&mdash;for several
reasons&mdash;fails. Indeed, even if the analogy is successful, the
idea of a &lsquo;non-relational tie&rsquo; remains obscure.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 Critics have complained that, from the fact that exact resemblance
must obtain simply given the existence of its relata, it does not
<em>follow</em> that it is no ontological addition to them (Daly 1997:
152). However, even if it is true that what supervenes does not
<em>have to</em> be considered as a mere &lsquo;pseudo-addition&rsquo;
to its subvenient base, the important thing here is that it <em>can
be</em>.</p>

 Another reason is given by Campbell, according to whom the regress is
benign because &ldquo;[i]t proceeds in a direction of greater and
greater formality and less and less substance&rdquo; (1990: 35-36).
This is not a very good reason for thinking that the regress is
unproblematic, however. It is hard to see why there should be any
difference in &lsquo;substance&rsquo; between the resemblances at the
different stages of the regress. In fact, it is hard to understand
what such a difference in &lsquo;substance&rsquo; could amount to in
the first place (Daly 1997: 151-152).</p>

 Note that this response only works if the nature of individual
tropes&mdash;<em>their being what they are</em>&mdash;is primitive and
not further analyzable (i.e., it only works if we assume a standard
view of the nature of tropes). To see this, compare the standard view
with a view with which it is often confused: resemblance nominalism.
On trope theory, tropes have the same nature if they resemble each
other, and they resemble each other (or not) <em>in virtue of the
(primitive) nature they each &lsquo;have&rsquo;</em> (or
&lsquo;are&rsquo;). According to resemblance nominalism, on the other
hand, two objects have the natures they do in virtue of the
resemblance relations which obtain between them. This means that,
whether they resemble or not, is not decided given the existence and
nature of the objects themselves. Rather, the pattern of dependence is
the other way around. And this&mdash;arguably&mdash;makes the regress
vicious. Perhaps for that reason, resemblance nominalism has no
explicit proponent among the trope theorists.</p>
</div>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>
 Some trope critics have argued that the fact that sameness of
property is accounted for in terms of resemblance also means that the
trope theorist must face versions of both the
<em>companionship</em> and the <em>imperfect community</em> problems
(first formulated by Goodman 1951 against classic resemblance
nominalism). According to the original companionship problem, first,
if everything that is F is G, and everything that is G is F then if
having a certain property means belonging to a certain resemblance
class, being F &equals; being G, even in cases
where&mdash;intuitively&mdash;we would say those properties are
distinct. And according to the imperfect community problem, if we
suppose the world contains only three things&mdash;one that is F and
G, one that is F and H, and one that is G and H&mdash;then these three
objects will resemble each other to an equal degree, and no non-member
will resemble each member to the same degree. Still, the class they
make up is hardly a <em>natural</em> class, since the only candidate
for the property it picks out is disjunctive and gerrymandered. On the
other hand, the class consisting of the object that is F and G and the
object that is F and H might be thought to be just that: natural. For,
intuitively, it picks out the property of being F. Problem is that
that this is <em>not</em> a resemblance class. For the object that is
G and H resembles the objects in that class to an equal degree. That
these objections can be formulated also against tropes is perhaps not
immediately obvious. Indeed, according to Campbell (1990: 32f.;
<em>cf.</em> also Williams 1997[1953]: 118), both the companionship
and the imperfect community problems arise precisely because the
members of the relevant &lsquo;similarity circles&rsquo; are complexly
natured, something the trope is not. To show that tropes nevertheless
fall prey to (versions of) these objections, Manley (2002;
<em>cf.</em> also Moreland 1985, 1989, 1997) suggests we consider,
first, a possible world in which every object is red. In this world,
the class of all red tropes will coincide with the class of all
colored tropes, yet it seems that the property of being red and the
property of being colored are distinct. And (to get a version of the
imperfect community problem) he asks us to imagine a possible world
which contains only three things (trope-bundles): one pink, one
baby-blue, and one deep purple. All these tropes (inexactly) resembles
each other. Pink and purple are both reddish, purple and baby-blue are
both bluish, and pink and baby-blue are both pale. Hence, together
they pick out a resemblance class. But what property is that? Suppose
the answer is &lsquo;coloredness&rsquo;. Then what resemblance class
will we identify with being bluish? None seems available, for as soon
as we set on a degree of resemblance high enough to group together the
bluish colors, pink (which resembles purple and baby-blue to that very
degree) comes along for the ride. In response to the first,
companionship, problem, Manley admits that it may seem tempting simply
to bite the bullet. After all, the sort of co-extension the trope
theorist will have to live with seems much less problematic than that
which the original argument points to. Manley still finds the
suggestion &ldquo;prohibitively odd&rdquo;. Among other
things because it follows that, whether two properties are distinct
will depend on things that are completely external to the issue at
hand, such as the existence (or not) of non-red things in the world
(Manley 2002: 84). A similarly evasive strategy (if not a biting of
the bullet) might seem feasible in the case of the imperfect
community. Perhaps the problem is that the example focuses on
&lsquo;higher-order&rsquo; or &lsquo;constructed&rsquo; properties
(like that of being bluish), yet the only properties there (really)
are are absolutely determinate. According to Manley, this, too, is a
dead end, however. For the same problems that could be formulated on
the &lsquo;manifest&rsquo; level, can now be formulated &lsquo;further
down the line&rsquo;. For more suggestions on how to get around these
problems, <em>cf.</em> e.g., Giberman (2014: 470) and Garcia
(2015<em>a</em>: 152).</p>

 Obvious contenders&mdash;all up for debate&mdash;include: not
depending on something else (or, not depending on something else
<em>belonging to a different category</em>) for your existence; having
a (complex) character; being spatiotemporally located; monopolizing
your position in space-time (i.e., being such that so-called
interpenetration with another concrete particular is ruled out); being
able to survive change; having causal powers; being the ultimate
subject of predication; being the basic object of reference; etc.

 Not all parts are created equal, though. According to e.g., Robb
(2005), trope-parts are not the sorts of parts that are
&ldquo;independent, additive, and arranged&rdquo;, which means that at
least some of the usual axioms of mereology will have to be given up
or at least modified. Why call them parts, then? According to Robb
(<i>ibid.</i>, 471) we should call them parts because, on the most general
conception of parthood, the parts of something exhaust its being in
the sense that it is nothing more than its parts related in some way
or other. According to Paul (2002: 578), moreover, thinking of the
parts of an object, not just as its spatial parts, but also as its
qualitative parts (she uses &lsquo;logical part&rsquo; to cover both),
results in a more &ldquo;fundamental account&rdquo;. According to
her&mdash;<em>not</em> a trope theorist&mdash;thus understanding the
structure of objects also allows us to, in a sense,
&lsquo;collapse&rsquo; the distinction between universals and tropes
(Paul bid: 583; <em>cf.</em> also her 2017): &ldquo;Logical parts
allow us to argue that characterizations of properties as tropes and
universals are just different sides of the same coin, and combine the
benefits of tropes and universals without their attendant
problems.&rdquo; Take two cups that are both red. Some would say that
we then have two exactly resembling tropes and some would say that we
have the same universal instantiated in both. Paul says that they
would all be right. When we have resembling tropes we have two
different objects with overlap with respect to (at least one of) their
logical parts. Once we subtract away the other parts of the objects,
we are left with one object that has no location properties as parts.
This object (R), partly overlaps objects that include location
properties as parts. R itself does not have any particular location.
According to McDaniel (2001), adopting a mereological trope theory can
in fact help solve a number of well-known puzzles for material
constitution, including that involving the alleged colocation of
material objects. He also thinks that both Heller&rsquo;s argument for
4-dimensionalism (Heller 1992) and Van Inwagen&rsquo;s argument
against mereological universalism (Van Inwagen 1990) fail on his
version of the bundle view.</p>

 Why not internal? Because if compresence is internal the following
possibilities are ruled out: First, that what happens to constitute
this concrete particular could exist and not constitute <em>any</em>
particular whatsoever. This is however a possibility most trope
theorists wouldn&rsquo;t mind if it came out empty (although some have
defended the possibility of so-called &lsquo;free-floaters&rsquo;,
<em>cf.</em> e.g., Campbell 1990 and Schaffer 2003). Second, that the
tropes which constitute the concrete particular could exist and
(partly) constitute some other concrete particular(s). <em>This</em>
is a possibility most trope theorists regard as genuine. Because they
do, they regard compresence as external.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-34">34.</a>
 Kein&auml;nen and Hakkarainen, although generally very positive to
Simons&rsquo; way of understanding the nature of the concrete
particular, nevertheless develop their own version of the theory,
primarily in order to avoid what they see as three major weaknesses
with Simons&rsquo; view (<em>cf.</em> esp. Kein&auml;nen 2011: 433):
(i) that it allows that there can be substances solely constituted by
a nucleus, but does not specify what kinds of nuclear tropes could
make up a substance of that kind; (ii) that it does not rule out the
possibility of two or more tropes falling under the same determinable,
making up the same object at the same time and; (iii) that the
dependence relations it posits do not constrain the spatiotemporal
location of tropes in any way, with the consequence that tropes must
not be colocated with the substance they make up. Especially this
third difficulty is a serious flaw according to Kein&auml;nen and
Hakkarainen.</p>

 According to Giberman (2014), when some tropes are compresent, this
is because one trope&mdash;the largest one&mdash;instead of being
colocated with the others, spatiotemporally contains them. On this
suggestion, some tropes form a bundle just in case all and only its
members are contained &lsquo;in&rsquo; the biggest one. Bundling is
hence not colocation, but cocontainment. <em>Cf.</em> also McDaniel
(2001) and (for an extension of the view that tropes are
spatiotemporal to the realm of the possible, McDaniel 2006).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-36">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-36">36.</a>
 A rather different version of this response is given in Lowe 2006.
According to Lowe&mdash;who defends a substrate-attribute view of
concrete particulars, and who accepts the existence of universals as
well as tropes&mdash;the unity of F<em>a</em> is effected, not by a
compresence-relation, but by a non-relational trope which
(asymmetrically) depends for its existence both on the existence of
the universal of which it is an instance, and on the existence of the
substrate it characterizes. Lowe&rsquo;s view arguably struggles with
what some trope theorists would consider an unnecessarily inflated
ontology (although Lowe himself would argue that all his posits are
independently justified).</p>

 Other solutions to the problem include the radical proposal that the
regress is benign <em>because</em> it is infinite (<em>cf.</em> Orilia
2009; Orilia and Swoyer 2017). <em>Cf.</em> also the holistic view
proposed in Schneider 2002 (inspired by Bacon 1995) and the view that
compresence is &lsquo;self-relating&rsquo; put forward in Ehring
2011.</p>

 According to some philosophers, events <em>are</em> tropes (Bennett
2002) or trope sequences (Campbell 1997[1981]) or relational tropes
(Mertz 1996) or even higher-order tropes (Moltmann 2013<em>b</em>). If
so, the fact (if indeed it is a fact) that every reason to posit
tropes is also a reason to posit events is obviously not a problem for
the trope theorist.</p>

<div id="note-39">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-39">39.</a>
 According to McDaniel (2001)&mdash;who defends a theory (TOPO)
according to which ordinary physical objects are mereological fusions
of monadic and polyadic tropes&mdash;adopting (his version of) the
trope view can even be used to argue for one particular theory of
persistence: 3-dimensionalism. For, McDaniel thinks, his version of
the trope-view solves the problems with 3-dimensionalism which Heller
(1992) famously pointed out. And it does so by allowing you to deny
that, if 4-dimensionalism is false, then if I exist after <em>t</em>,
I have all of the same parts after <em>t</em> that I had prior to
<em>t</em> minus the now detached particle. Reason: there were
polyadic tropes inhering in the various particles that were my parts
prior to <em>t</em>, inclduing the then undetached particle, that do
not inhere in them after <em>t</em> (precisely because one particle
detached). After <em>t</em>, new polyadic tropes inhere in the
particles that are my parts after <em>t</em>; these polyadic tropes
are also parts of me after <em>t</em>.</p>

 Schneider agrees that couching your ontology in terms of
(mathematical) bundles and cross-sections (i.e., fields) is
productive. The only problem, from the perspective of trope theory, is
that the best way to achieve all of that while staying mathematically
adequate is in terms of an ontology that does not include anything
that can in any obvious sense be categorized as tropes (2006: 11).</p>

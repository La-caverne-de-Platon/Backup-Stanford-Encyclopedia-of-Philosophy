<h2>Appendix 8: The Articulation of Theory: Weak Interactions</h2>

<p>

Radioactivity, the spontaneous decay of a substance, produces alpha
(\(\alpha\)) particles (positively charged helium nuclei), or beta
(\(\beta\)) particles (electrons), or gamma rays (high energy
electromagnetic radiation). It was discovered in 1896 by Henri
Becquerel. Experimental work on the energy of the electrons emitted in
\(\beta\)-decay began in the early twentieth century, and the observed
continuous energy spectrum posed a problem. If \(\beta\)-decay were a
two-body decay (for example, neutron \(\rightarrow\) proton \(+\)
electron) then applying the laws of conservation of energy and of
conservation of momentum requires that the energy of the electron have
a unique value, not a continuous
spectrum.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A8-1" name="note-A8-1">1</a>]</sup>
Thus, the observed continuous energy spectrum cast doubt on both of
these conservation laws.  Physicists speculated that perhaps the
electrons lost energy in escaping the substance, with different
electrons losing different amounts of energy, thus accounting for the
energy spectrum. Careful experiments showed that this was not the case
so the problem remained.  In the early 1930s Pauli suggested that a
low-mass neutral particle, named by Fermi as the neutrino, was also
emitted in
 \(\beta\)-decay.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A8-2"name="note-A8-2">2</a>]</sup> 
 This solved the problem of the continuous energy spectrum because in a
three-body decay (neutron proton + electron + neutrino) the energy of
the electron was no longer required to be unique. The electron could
have a continuous energy spectrum and the conservation laws were
saved.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A8-3" name="note-A8-3">3</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

In 1934 Fermi proposed a new theory of \(\beta\)-decay that
incorporated this new particle (Fermi 1934). He added a perturbation
energy due to the decay interaction to the Hamiltonian describing the
nuclear system. Pauli (1933) had previously shown that the perturbation
could have only five different forms if the Hamiltonian is to be
relativistically invariant. These are \(S\), the scalar interaction; \(P\),
pseudoscalar; \(V\), vector; \(A\), axial vector; and \(T\), tensor. Fermi knew
this but chose, in analogy with electromagnetic theory, to use only the
vector interaction. His theory initially received support from the work
of Sargent (1932; 1933) and others. There remained, however, the
question of whether or not the other forms of the interaction also
entered into the
 Hamiltonian.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A8-4" name="note-A8-4">4</a>]</sup>
 In this episode we shall see how
experiment helped to determine the mathematical form of the weak
interaction.</p>

<p>

Gamow and Teller (1936) soon proposed a modification of Fermi&rsquo;s vector
theory. Fermi&rsquo;s theory had originally required a selection rule, the
change in \(J = 0\), where \(J\) is the angular momentum of the
nucleus, and did not include the effects of nuclear spin. Gamow and
Teller included nuclear spin and obtained selection rules, change in
\(J = 0 \pm 1\) for allowed transitions, with no \(0-0\) transitions
allowed.  The Gamow-Teller modification required either a tensor or an
axial vector form of the interaction. Their theory helped to solve
some of the difficulties that arose in assigning nuclear spins using
only the Fermi selection rule. At the end of the 1930s there was
support for Fermi&rsquo;s theory with some preference for the Gamow-Teller
selections rules and the tensor interaction.</p>

<p>

The work of Fierz (1937) helped to restrict the allowable forms of
the interaction. He showed that if both \(S\) and \(V\) interactions were
present in the allowed \(\beta\)-decay interaction, or both \(A\) and \(T\), then there
would be an interference term of the form \(1 + a/W\) in the allowed
\(\beta\)-decay spectrum, where W is the electron energy. This term vanished
if the admixtures were not present. The failure to observe these
interference terms showed that the decay interaction did not contain
both \(S\) and \(V\), or both \(A\) and \(T\).</p>

<p>
The presence of either the \(T\) or \(A\) form of the interaction in at
least part of the \(\beta\)-decay interaction was shown by Mayer,
Moszkowski, and Nordheim (1951). They found twenty five decays for
which the change in \(J\) was \(0\pm 1\), with no parity change. These
decays could only occur if the \(A\) or \(T\) forms were present. Their
conclusion depended on the correct assignment of nuclear spins which,
although reliable, still retained some uncertainty. Further evidence,
which did not depend on knowledge of the nuclear spins, came from an
examination of the spectra of unique forbidden
 transitions.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A8-5" name="note-A8-5">5</a>]</sup>
 These were n-times forbidden
transitions in which the change in nuclear spin was \(n + 1\). These
transitions require the presence of either \(A\) or \(T\). In addition, only a
single form of the interaction makes any appreciable contribution to
the decay. This allows the prediction of the shape of the spectrum for
such transitions. Konopinski and Uhlenbeck (1941) showed that for an
\(n\)-times forbidden transition the spectrum would be that of an allowed
transition multiplied by an energy dependent term \(a_n(W)\). For
a first-forbidden transition \(a_1 = C[(W^2 - m^2 c^4) + (W_o - W)^2]\). The
spectrum for <sup>91</sup>Y measured by Langer and Price (1949)
(Figure 16) shows the clear presence of either
the A or T forms of the interaction. The spectrum requires the
energy-dependent correction.</p>

\(\ce{^{91}Y}\).
The best theoretical fit is that which gives a straight line. The Fermi
theory alone, \(a_1=1\), does not give a straight line. The
correction factor \(a_1 = C[(W^2 - m_o c^2) + (W_o - W)^2]\), does
give a linear plot. From Konopinski and Langer (1953).
</p>
</div>

<p>

Evidence in favor of the presence of either the \(S\) or \(V\) forms of the
interaction was provided by Sherr, Muether, and White (1949) and by
Sherr and Gerhart (1952). They observed the decay of \(\ce{^{14}O}\) to
an excited state of \(\ce{^{14}N}\), \(\ce{^{14}N^{\ast}}\). They
argued that both \(\ce{^{14}O}\) and \(\ce{^{14}N^{\ast}}\) had spin
0. This required the presence of either \(S\) or \(V\) because the decay was
forbidden by \(A\) and \(T\). (Recall that the Gamow-Teller selection rules
specified no 0 to 0 transitions).</p>

<p>

Further progress in isolating the particular forms of the interaction
was made by examining the spectra of once-forbidden transitions. Here
too, interference effects, similar to those predicted by Fierz, were
also expected. A. Smith (1951) and Pursey (1951) found that the
spectrum for these transitions would contain energy dependent terms of
the form \(G_V G_T / W\), \(G_A G_P / W\), and \(G_S G_A / W\), where
the \(G\)s are the coupling constants for the various interactions,
and \(W\) is the electron energy. The linear spectrum found
for \(\ce{^{147}Pm}\) demonstrated the absence of these terms (Langer,
Motz and Price 1950).</p>

<p>

Let us summarize the situation. There were five allowable forms of the
decay interaction; \(S\), \(T\), \(A\), \(V\), \(P\). The failure to
observe Fierz interference showed that the interaction could not
contain both \(S\) and \(V\) or both \(A\) and \(T\). Experiments
showing the presence of Gamow-Teller selections rules and on unique
forbidden transitions had shown that either \(A\) or \(T\) must be
present. The decay of \(\ce{^{14}O}\) to \(\ce{^{14}N^{\ast}}\) had
demonstrated that either \(S\) or \(V\) must also be present. This
restricted the forms of the interaction to \(STP\), \(SAP\), \(VTP\),
or \(VAP\) or doublets taken from these combinations. The absence of
interference terms in the once-forbidden spectra eliminated the \(VT\),
\(SA\), and \(AP\) combinations. \(VP\) was eliminated because it did not allow
Gamow-Teller transitions. This left only the \(STP\) triplet or the \(VA\)
doublet as the possible interactions.</p>

<p>

The spectrum of RaE provided the decisive evidence. Petschek and
Marshak (1952) analyzed the spectrum of RaE and found that the only
interaction that would give a good fit to the spectrum was a
combination of \(T\) and \(P\). This was, in fact, the only evidence favoring
the presence of the P interaction. This led Konopinski and Langer
(1953), in their 1953 review article on \(\beta\)-decay to conclude that,
&ldquo;As we shall interpret the evidence here, the correct law must be what
is known as an \(STP\) combination (1953, p. 261).&rdquo;</p>

<p>

Unfortunately, the evidence from the RaE spectrum had led the
physics community astray. Petschek and Marshak had noted that their
conclusion was quite sensitive to assumptions made in their
calculation. &ldquo;Thus, an error in the finite radius correction of
approximately 0.1 percent leads to an error of up to 25% in
\(C_{1(T+P)}\) [the theoretical correction term].&rdquo; Further
theoretical analysis cast doubt on their assumptions, but all of this
became moot when \(K\).
 Smith<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A8-6" name="note-A8-6">6</a>]</sup>
measured the spin of RaE and found it to be one, incompatible with the
Petschek-Marshak analysis.</p>

<p>

The demise of the RaE evidence removed the necessity of including
the \(P\) interaction in the theory of \(\beta\)-decay, and left the decision
between the \(STP\) and \(VA\) combinations unresolved. The dilemma was
resolved by evidence provided by angular-correlation experiments,
particularly that from the experiment on \(\ce{^{6}He}\) by Rustad and
Ruby (1953; 1955)</p>

<p>

<strong>(a) Angular Correlation Experiments</strong>. Angular
correlation experiments are those in which both the decay electron and
the recoil nucleus from \(\beta\)-decay are detected in coincidence. The
experiments measured the distribution in angle between the electron and
the recoil nucleus for a fixed range of electron energy, or measured
the energy spectrum of either the electron or the nucleus at a fixed
angle between them. These quantities are quite sensitive to the form of
the decay interaction and became decisive pieces of evidence in the
search for the form of the decay interaction. Hamilton (1947)
calculated the form of the angular distribution expected for both
allowed and forbidden decays, assuming only one type of interaction 
(\(S\), \(V\), \(T\), \(A\), \(P\)) was present. He found, for allowed transitions, that the
angular distributions for the specific forms of the interaction would
be different. A more general treatment was given by de Groot and
Tolhoek (1950). They found that the general form of the angular
distribution for allowed decays depended on the combination of the
particular forms of the interactions in the decay Hamiltonian. For
single forms their results agreed with those of Hamilton.</p>

<p>

The most important of the experiments performed at this time was the
measurement of the angular correlation in the decay of \(\ce{^{6}He}\).
This decay was a pure Gamow-Teller transition and thus was sensitive to
the amounts of \(A\) and \(T\) present in the decay interaction. The decisive
experiment was that of Rustad and Ruby (1953; 1955). This experiment
was regarded as establishing that the Gamow-Teller part of the
interaction was predominantly tensor. This was the conclusion reached
in several review papers on the nature of \(\beta\)-decay. (Ridley 1954;
Kofoed-Hansen 1955; Wu 1955). The experimental apparatus is shown in
Figure 17. The definition of the decay volume
was extremely important. In order to measure the angular correlation
one must know the position of the decay so that one can measure the
angle between the electron and the recoil nucleus. The decay volume for
the helium gas in this experiment was defined by a 180
microgram/cm<sup>2</sup> aluminum hemisphere and the pumping diaphragm.
Rustad and Ruby (1953) presented two experimental results. The first
was the coincidence rate as a function of the angle between the
electron and the recoil nucleus for electrons in the energy range 
(2.5&ndash;4.0) mc<sup>2</sup>. The second was the energy spectrum of the
decay electrons with the angle between the electron and the recoil
nucleus fixed at 180&deg;. Both results are shown in
Figure 18 along with the predicted results for
\(A\) and \(T\), respectively. The dominance of the tensor interaction is
clear. This conclusion was made more emphatic in their 1955 paper which
included more details of the experiment and even more data. The later
results, shown in Figure 19, clearly
demonstrate the superior fit of the tensor interaction.</p>

<p>

The Rustad-Ruby result, along with several others, established that
the Gamow-Teller part of the decay interaction was tensor and that the
decay interaction was \(STP\), or \(ST\), rather than \(VA\). We have seen clearly
in this episode the fruitful interaction between experiment and theory.
Theoretical predictions became more precise and were tested
experimentally until the form of the weak interaction was found.
Fermi&rsquo;s theory of \(\beta\)-decay had been confirmed. It had also been
established that the interaction was a combination of scalar, tensor,
and pseudoscalar \((STP)\).</p>

<strong>(b) Epilogue</strong>. It would be nice to report that such
a simple, satisfying story, with its happy ending was the last word. It
wasn&rsquo;t. Work continued on angular correlation experiments and the happy
agreement was soon destroyed (Franklin 1990, Chapter 3). Things became
more complex with the discovery of parity nonconservation in the weak
interactions, including \(\beta\)-decay. Sudarshan and Marshak (1958) and
Feynman and Gell-Mann (1958) showed that only a \(V-A\) interaction was
compatible with parity nonconservation. If there was to be a single
interaction describing all the weak interactions then there was a
serious conflict between this work and the Rustad-Ruby result. This led
Wu and Schwarzschild (1958) to reexamine and reanalyze the Rustad-Ruby
experiment. They found, by calculation and by constructing a physical
analogue of the gas system, that a considerable fraction of the helium
gas (approximately 12%) was not in the decay volume. This changed the
result for the angular correlation considerably and cast doubt on the
Rustad-Ruby
 result.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A8-7" name="note-A8-7">7</a>]</sup>
 The
<sup>6</sup>He angular correlation experiment was redone, correcting
the problem with the gas target, and the new result is shown in
Figure 20 (Hermannsfeldt et al. 1958). It
clearly favors A, the axial vector interaction. Once again, physics was
both fallible and corrigible. This new result on \(\ce{^{6}He}\)
combined with the discovery of parity nonconservation established that
the form of the weak interaction was \(V-A\).</p>

<h2>Supplement 1: Challenges to Mereological Essentialism for Masses</h2>

<p>Laycock (2006) argues that a mass of matter, such as some ice, can
change its parts and remain the very same ice, as well as arguing that
not any old collection of H<sub>2</sub>O molecules have a fusion. </p>

<p>
Laycock argues that &lsquo;the ice&rsquo; in &lsquo;the ice in my gin and tonic&rsquo;
cannot refer to a sum (2006, pp.&thinsp;22&ndash;28). Laycock argues that the
supposition that the reference of mass expressions is to mereological
sums, and that sums are particulars, leads to a contradiction. Suppose
at <em>t</em><sub>1</sub> Henry puts ice in his drink, and that some of it
melts by <em>t</em><sub>2</sub>. On a sum view, &lsquo;the ice&rsquo; at
<em>t</em><sub>1</sub> refers to a sum of matter composing all and
only <em>the ice in Henry&rsquo;s drink at t</em><sub>1</sub>. <em>The ice
in his drink at <em>t</em></em><sub>2</sub> is not identical, since some of the
ice is no more&mdash;it has melted.</p>

<p>So, the following seems true:</p>

<dl class="hangindent">
<dt>(d)</dt><dd> at <em>t</em><sub>2</sub>, ~<em>x</em> (<em>x</em> is
the ice added at <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>)</dd></dl>

<p>Yet, says Laycock, it is not until <em>t</em><sub>3</sub>, when all of the
ice is melted, that <em>the ice in his drink</em> ceases to be. If so,
then the following would also be true (2006, p.&thinsp;23):</p>

<dl class="hangindent">
<dt>(e)</dt><dd> at <em>t</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>x</em> (<em>x</em> is
the ice added at <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>)</dd></dl>

<p>
(d) and (e) seem contradictory. Laycock attempts to dissolve the
problem by attacking what led to it, viz., that all reference is
singular reference, and mass reference is reference to singular sums
(which have all of their parts essentially). As well as singular
reference, there is plural reference (e.g., &lsquo;The gerbils in the
pet store&rsquo;) and mass reference (e.g., &lsquo;the water in Lake
Michigan&rsquo;). Mass reference is not reference to things, but to
concrete non-particular stuff. There is no <em>thing</em> which is the
referent of &lsquo;the ice&rsquo; (and, since sums are particular
things, then &lsquo;the ice&rsquo; cannot refer to a sum).</p>

<p>While there are other reasons for considering mass-reference to
refer to entities which are concrete but not particular (and Laycock
gives such reasons), the ice argument does not seem to be a knock-down
argument for the proposal. For starters, as many have shown, it proves
too much. The argument is supposed to prove that &lsquo;the
ice&rsquo;, while it does <em>refer</em>, does not refer to
a <em>thing</em>, especially not a sum, since, in that case, MEM would
be true of it. This is because &lsquo;the ice&rsquo; continues to
refer to the same entity through loss of parts.</p>

<p>
But arguments of the same form could be made about things as well.
Think of a red patch that is being erased (Sennet 2007), a cake that is
gradually being eaten at a party (Koslicki 2007) or a cat in a bag
which is losing weight over time (McKay 2008). If none of these
examples support the idea that patches, cakes, or cats are not things, then it
is hard to see why the ice example shows this. </p>

<blockquote><p>This is an interesting puzzle, but in this form I don&rsquo;t
think that it should detain the partisan of bits (parcels, quantities)
of matter&hellip;For example, one could argue that the phrase
&lsquo;the ice at <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo; denotes a bit of
matter by an accidental property, that it is ice
at <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>. That bit of matter persists as the ice
melts, but not all of it is ice at <em>t</em><sub>2</sub>.  Thus
&lsquo;the ice at <em>t</em><sub>2 </sub>&rsquo; denotes a distinct
bit of matter (a sub-bit of the <em>t</em><sub>1 </sub>bit), and so
(b) is true. The bit of matter (that is ice at <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>)
never ceases to be in our imagined case, but
at <em>t</em><sub>3</sub>, the last cold morsel of it ceases to be
ice. At that point, the bit of matter that was ice
at <em>t</em><sub>1</sub> has all become non-ice. (McKay 2008,
p.&thinsp;307)</p></blockquote>

<p>
So the friend of sums has reason to believe that (d) is
false. But teasing out the ramifications of the falsity of (d)
reveals some notable constraints upon the sum
theorist. </p>

<p>
There are other powerful reasons why one cannot remain a strict
mereological essentialist while also adhering to folk intuitions about
the individuation of stuffs, if one is also against the possibility of
coincidence (see <a href="supplement2.html">supplement 2</a> for
details). The sum theorist seemingly has to accept the view that all
composite atomic and all fuzzy atomless stuffs, such as blood, taco
sauce and crude oil, are accidental phases of masses.  Object-reducing
sum theorists will also have to reduce complex stuffs, so that kinds
such as <em>water</em> do not essentially apply to what falls under
them. Let us see why.</p>

<p>
Suppose you have a two-chambered container of water. Suppose
electrolysis is performed on it, separating the hydrogen into one
chamber and the oxygen in the other, and then the two chambers are
sealed. Suppose further that no hydrogen or oxygen molecules are lost
in the process. Do you have the same stuff left over or not? You do,
in the sense that there is no fundamental matter unaccounted for after
the procedure that was there before. But you do not, in that you do
not have any water left. So, this shows that &lsquo;same stuff&rsquo;
is ambiguous between at least two readings: 1) same fusion of
fundamental particles, 2) same fusion of fundamental particles whose
parts remain in the right kind of relations to continue making up a
portion of stuff of kind <em>K</em> (cf. Kleinschmidt 2007, section
3.1). This also points out the problem of &lsquo;Stuff-Stuff
Coincidence&rsquo;, which has not been extensively discussed (see
Barnett 2004; Donnely and Bittner 2008; and Kleinschmidt 2007 for
stuff-stuff coincidence discussions).</p>

<p>
In fact, There could be a third, &lsquo;loose&rsquo; reading of
&lsquo;same stuff&rsquo;, where some portion of stuff can be the same
portion even if some particles are lost. The folk will regularly say
things like &ldquo;Gottfried used the bath water to wash the
dishes!&rdquo; implying that it is the same water, even though some of
the bath water would have evaporated. Most likely there are stricter
and looser senses of &lsquo;same stuff&rsquo; (Zimmerman 1995, section
8).</p>

<p>
David Barnett argues convincingly that some portion of oil can remain
the same portion of oil while not remaining the same sum of oil, since
some of its constituent molecules can unbind and then rebind with
others, so that </p><blockquote><p>
that very [sum] of oil&hellip;no longer exists&hellip;[but
the oil] survives; for each of its molecules retains an oil-forming
relation with some of the others throughout the entire
procedure. (Barnett 2004, p.&thinsp;91)</p></blockquote>

<p>
The sum theorist must contend that there are no portions of
heterogeneous stuff-kinds which are identical with mere sums, if they
wish to avoid stuff-stuff coincidence
(see <a href="index-2.html#SomTer">section 2.1 of the main entry</a> for
the terminological definitions).  Hence they will treat complex stuffs
as they do ordinary objects.  Some gold, for instance, can be treated
as a fiction or logical construction out of a mass of matter, or as
some stuff which is not a sum of gold which has the property of being
golden, or as some stuff which is &lsquo;golding.&rsquo;
(cf. Kleinschmidt 2007, p.&thinsp;416).</p>

<p>So, since the friend of sums has the same reasons to reduce or
eliminate complex stuffs as she does to reduce or eliminate ordinary
objects, then she should do so. The only genuine portions of stuff
kinds which the sum theorist should believe in would be kinds of
fundamental entities, e.g., &lsquo;electron-stuff&rsquo;,
&lsquo;green-down-quark-stuff&rsquo;, and so on. </p>

<p>
The foregoing shows how the sum theorist can resist arguments such as
Barnett&rsquo;s and Laycock&rsquo;s. The price that the mereologist has to pay for keeping form
out of the equation for individuating sums is denying that complex
stuffs are similar to fundamental stuffs, and are in fact more similar
to the things which they sought to reduce (cf. Kleinschmidt 2007).</p>
<p>Lastly, van Inwagen (2009) argues that all objects are mereological
sums, and since objects change parts, then so do sums. This argument
can be quite powerful if one is independently motivated to deny
arbitrary sums, and goes along with denying Unrestricted Mereology.
See <a href="index-2.html#SerPlu">section 3.2 of the main entry</a> for
more discussion on the denial of arbitrary sums (see van Inwagen 1981
as well for a rejection of the &ldquo;Doctrine of Arbitrary Undetached
Parts&rdquo;). This kind of view also goes against the denial of many
mereologists that structure or arrangement is part of the identity and
individuation of mereological sums, which seems to be their <em>raison
d&rsquo;etre</em>, and how they earn their theoretical keep. </p>

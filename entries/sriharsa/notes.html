 In his poem, <em>The Exploits of Nala, the King of Ni&#7779;adha</em>
(<em>Nai&#7779;adh&#299;yacarita</em>), &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a
informs the reader that he was honored by the king of K&#257;nyakubja
(Kanauj in modern-day Uttar Pradesh). Throughout the first millennium
CE, the kings of Kanauj were patrons of Sanskrit literature, having
supported renowned poets like B&#257;&#7751;abha&#7789;&#7789;a and
Bhavabh&#363;ti. It remains unclear exactly which king of Kanauj
honored &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a: both pre-modern commentators and
contemporary literary historians have failed to ascertain this.
However, they do agree that the patron of &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a
must have been a king from the G&#257;ha&#7693;av&#257;la dynasty
which ruled parts of modern-day Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the
11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> centuries: either Govindacandra
(1114&ndash;1155 CE), or his son Vijayacandra (1155&ndash;1170 CE), or
his grandson Jayacandra (1170&ndash;1193 CE). For discussion, see Jani
(1996) and Patel (2014).</p>

 At various places within his works, &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a mentions
a couple of philosophical works other than <em>The Sweets of
Refutation</em>. In <em>The Exploits of Nala</em>, he mentions a text,
<em>The Examination of Permanence</em>
(<em>Sthairyavic&#257;ra&#7751;a</em>), which attacks the Buddhist
theory of momentariness. In <em>The Sweets of Refutation</em>, he
cites another work, <em>The Intention of God</em>
(<em>&#298;&#347;var&#257;bhisandhi</em>), several times. This work
seems to have dealt with questions of whether our conscious mental
states are self-intimating, whether the Upani&#7779;adic sentences can
be a source of knowledge when their content is contradicted by
perception, etc. Unfortunately, none of these texts are extant;
<em>The Sweets of Refutation</em> and <em>The Exploits of Nala</em>
are the only surviving, published works of &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a.
See, e.g., Granoff (1978) and Jani (1996).</p>

 Granoff (1978) argues that there are two respects in which
&#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a&rsquo;s views depart from the standard
doctrine of Advaita Ved&#257;nta. First, she claims that unlike other
defenders of Advaita Ved&#257;nta who treat the perceptible world as
provisionally real but not ultimately so, &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a
doesn&rsquo;t accept the provisional reality of the perceptible world.
Second, she claims that unlike other defenders of Advaita
Ved&#257;nta, &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a in fact thinks that the object
of awareness is non-distinct from awareness itself. I think the second
claim is correct, but the first is not. There is at least one passage
within the text where &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a points out that a
<em>Brahmav&#257;din</em> (one who thinks that only the Brahman or the
self is ultimately real) need not repudiate the reality of the
plurality of things in the perceptible world altogether (see, e.g.,
KKh 112: &ldquo;<em>na vaya&#7747; bhedasya sarvathaiva asattvam
abhyupagacch&#257;ma&#7717;| kin n&#257;ma p&#257;ram&#257;rthikam
asattvam| avidy&#257;vidyam&#257;natva&#7747; tu tad&#299;yam
i&#7779;yata eva&hellip;</em>&rdquo;). For dissent from
Granoff&rsquo;s view, see Phillips (1997) and Ram-Prasad (2002).</p>

 Amongst the defenders of Advaita Ved&#257;nta, both Citsukha and
&#256;nandap&#363;r&#7751;a wrote largely sympathetic commentaries on
<em>The Sweets of Refutation</em>. In Citsukha&rsquo;s other work,
especially in <em>The Lamp to the Truth</em>
(<em>Tattvaprad&#299;pik&#257;</em>), some arguments that appear in
<em>Sweets of Refutation</em> are developed in greater detail. After
Ga&#7749;ge&#347;a Up&#257;dhy&#257;ya&rsquo;s reconstruction of
Ny&#257;ya, a number of Ny&#257;ya philosophers wrote commentaries on
<em>The Sweets of Refutation</em> primarily with the aim of refuting
its arguments: in Mithil&#257;, this included Vardham&#257;na,
&#346;a&#7747;kara Mi&#347;ra, V&#257;caspati Mi&#347;ra II,
Pragalbha, Gokulan&#257;tha Up&#257;dhy&#257;ya, and in Bengal,
&lsquo;New Reason&rsquo; philosophers like Raghudeva and
Raghun&#257;tha S&#257;rvabhauma Bha&#7789;&#7789;&#257;c&#257;rya.
See Ganeri (2011: 132&ndash;133).</p>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Here, the Sanskrit expression
&lsquo;<em>lak&#7779;a&#7751;a</em>&rsquo; is ambiguous between a
sentence (<em>lak&#7779;a&#7751;a-v&#257;kya</em>) that states the
defining property of an object and the defining property
(<em>lak&#7779;a&#7751;a-dharma</em>) itself. While
V&#257;tsy&#257;yana means the latter when he uses the word, later
commentators such as V&#257;caspati mean the former. When I use the
English word &lsquo;definition&rsquo;, I will uniformly mean the
sentence which states the defining property.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 The principle, in &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a&rsquo;s own words, stands
as follows: &ldquo;Whether the definiendum can be specified depends on
the definiendum (<em>lak&#7779;a&#7751;&#257;dh&#299;na t&#257;val
lak&#7779;yavyavasthiti&#7717;</em>)&rdquo; (KKh 126). Similar
principles are discussed by other writers, e.g., Citsukha. In
<em>Tattvaprad&#299;pik&#257;</em> II.18, Citsukha says: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Whether a knowable entity can be established depends on the means of
knowing, while whether the means of knowing can be established depends
on the definition (or the defining property)
(<em>m&#257;n&#257;dh&#299;n&#257; meyasiddhi&#7717;
m&#257;nasiddhistu lak&#7779;a&#7751;&#257;t</em>). (&#346;&#257;str&#299; 1915:
217)</p>
</blockquote>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a&rsquo;s use of the expression
&lsquo;<em>anirvican&#299;ya</em>&rsquo; differs significantly from
that of his Advaita precedessors. Typically, other defenders of
Advaita Ved&#257;nta, such as Padmap&#257;da (8<sup>th</sup> or
9<sup>th</sup> century CE), Ma&#7751;&#7693;ana Mi&#347;ra
(8<sup>th</sup> century CE) and V&#257;caspati Mi&#347;ra, claim that
the variegated world, as it appears in perception, is indeterminable
or <em>anirvacan&#299;ya</em>, insofar as it is neither ultimately
real like the self or the Brahman, nor it is ultimately unreal, e.g.,
tortoise-fur (since it forms the basis of our linguistic and physical
behavior). By contrast, when &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a says that the
variegated world is indeterminable, what he means is that we cannot
define the constituents of that world. For a history of the concept of
<em>anirvican&#299;ya</em> as it appears in Ma&#7751;&#7693;ana
Mi&#347;ra, see Thrasher (1993: ch. 1).</p>

 On the face of it, the criterion of uniformity seems too demanding.
If the kind <i>K</i> is merely part of our folk classification of
things, it is unclear why a disjunctive definition of <i>K</i> would
necessarily be defective. To borrow an example from Kingsbury and
McKeown-Green (2009), take the concept of <em>jazz</em>, which
presumably has evolved in response of changing social and cultural
phenomena, e.g., the interests of journalists in the late 1950s or the
musical taste of musicians in the 1930s. Under such circumstances, one
may indeed expect that the best definition of jazz would just be a
disjunction of different conditions each of which may be sufficient
condition for being a work of jazz, but none of which may be a
necessary condition for its being a work of jazz. However, in defense
of &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a, it is worth pointing out that when the
best definition available for a kind <i>K</i> is a disjunction of a
bunch of theoretically interesting sufficient conditions, the
definition won&rsquo;t bring to light any theoretically interesting
similarity amongst the different instances of <i>K</i>. As a result,
the definition won&rsquo;t provide much information about why
<i>K</i>-hood&mdash;in itself&mdash;is a theoretically interesting
property at all. Thus, as long as &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a&rsquo;s
opponent is committed to the idea that the epistemological and
ontological kinds that she defines are theoretically interesting, the
criterion of uniformity might still have some force against her.</p>

<p>
In fact, while discussing definitions of <em>knowledge</em>, the later
Ny&#257;ya philosopher Ga&#7749;ge&#347;a Up&#257;dhy&#257;ya
explicitly argues that absence of uniformity is not really a defect of
definitions. See, e.g., Tarkav&#257;g&#299;&#347;a (1974a: 417) and
Phillips (1993: 48&ndash;49). However, in the Chapter on Inference in
<em>The Philosophers&rsquo; Stone</em>
(<em>Tattvacint&#257;ma&#7751;i</em>), Ga&#7749;ge&#347;a himself
attempts to offer a definition of pervasion (<em>vy&#257;pti</em>)
that satisfies uniformity; see Tarkav&#257;g&#299;&#347;a (1974b:
243). Also, see Guha (1979) for some discussion of uniformity
(<em>anugama</em>) in Ny&#257;ya after Ga&#7749;ge&#347;a.</p>

 According to many editions of the text (e.g., KKh 210), the proposal
reads: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What if we insert the qualifier &lsquo;produced by a method that never
gives rise to false awareness&rsquo;
(<em>avyabhic&#257;rikara&#7751;ajanyatve sat&#299;ti
vise&#7779;a&#7751;&#299;yam iti cet</em>)? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On an alternative reading (given by Jha 1904&ndash;1914: 387) which
fits better with the subsequent arguments, the text is </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
What if we insert the qualifier &lsquo;produced by an epistemic
instrument that never gives rise to false awareness&rsquo;?
(<em>avyabhic&#257;rik&#257;ra&#7751;ajanyatve sat&#299;ti

 The sensitivity condition on knowledge was proposed by Nozick (1981),
while the safety condition on knowledge proposed by Sosa (1999). Even
though Sosa didn&rsquo;t explicitly speak about methods, a fully
fleshed out version of safety would have to do so; for discussion, see
Pritchard (2005) and Lasonen-Aarnio (2010). </p>

 &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a never explicitly states this principle.
However, at Kkh 210, he says that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
You cannot establish that accidentally true awareness is produced by a
set of causal conditions shared by episodes of false awareness; for
then even false awareness-episodes&mdash;insofar as they are produced
by the same causal conditions&mdash;would be true (<em>na ca

 The only argument that &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a gives for this
principle in
<em>Kha&#7751;&#7693;anakha&#7751;&#7693;akh&#257;dya</em> (Kkh 210)
is this: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The truth of this awareness-episode is not uncaused; for, if that were
the case, since the truth of an awareness-episode would be causally
undetermined, there would be cases of overgeneration [i.e., even false
awareness-episodes could become true or cases of knowledge could turn
out to be false] (<em>na hy ahetukam ev&#257;sya yath&#257;rthatvam;

Udayana and his predecessors reject the KK principle, i.e., the principle that if one knows that <i>p</i>, then one knows that one knows that <i>p</i>. For V&#257;caspati Mi&#347;ra and Udayana,
knowledge of one&rsquo;s knowledge is acquired by inference. However,
there are different kinds of inference that might give rise to such
higher-order knowledge, depending on what kind of epistemic situation
one finds oneself in. In one kind of epistemic situation, the
awareness-episode that an agent is assessing might be unfamiliar; in
order to know whether she knows in such a scenario, the agent will
need some independent evidence in favor of the reliability of the
relevant awareness-episode. In cases of such unfamiliar awareness
(<em>anabhy&#257;sa-da&#347;&#257;panna-j&ntilde;&#257;na)</em>,
therefore, the agent can infer that her awareness-episode is an
instance of knowledge on the basis of the fact that it produces
successful action (<em>samarthaprav&#7771;ttijanakatva</em>). In the
other kind of epistemic situation, the awareness-episode that the
agent is assessing might be familiar, i.e., a kind of
awareness-episode that she has undergone before. In the case of such
familiar awareness
(<em>abhy&#257;sa-da&#347;&#257;panna-j&ntilde;&#257;na</em>), the
agent won&rsquo;t need any new evidence to conclude that her
awareness-episode is an instance of knowledge. She can infer that her
awareness-episode is an instance of knowledge by appealing to what
V&#257;caspati and Udayana call &ldquo;sameness of sort&rdquo;
(<em>tajj&#257;t&#299;yatva</em>) (Thakur 1967: 29; 95&ndash;97). The
idea is somewhat plausible. Suppose I enter my office, and see that my
computer is on my desk. I have had plenty of similar experiences
before, and on those cases, I acquired knowledge. Since this awareness
is of the same kind, I can with good reason infer, and thereby know,
that I know that my computer is on my desk. In this case,
&ldquo;sameness of sort&rdquo; is the guide to knowing that one
knows.</p>

<p>
Udayana points out that &ldquo;sameness of sort&rdquo; may pick
different properties of an awareness-episode in different cases, but
in each case, the property is sufficient to make the relevant
awareness-episode knowledge. For instance, in the case of perceptual
awareness, it is a perceptual awareness of an object with its
<em>distinctive mark</em> (<em>vi&#347;e&#7779;a</em>), i.e., some
property that decisively indicates the presence of that object
(<em>lak&#7779;a&#7751;a-sahacarita-lak&#7779;yavi&#7779;ayaj&ntilde;&#257;natvam
eva j&ntilde;&#257;nagata&#7747; tajj&#257;t&#299;yatvam iti</em>). If
an agent sees a person along with his characteristic features such as
limbs, etc., at a distance, she can know it to be a person rather than
say a tree-trunk. So, if one knows that one is perceptually aware of a
person along with her distinctive mark of having limbs, etc., one can
know that one knows that it&rsquo;s a person. A similar story could
also be told in the case of inference. The &ldquo;sameness of
sort&rdquo; on the basis of which one could know an inferential
awareness to be knowledge could consist in its being an inferential
awareness of an unobserved object on basis of its <em>distinctive
mark</em>. If I see a distinctive mark of fire, e.g., smoke, and infer
the presence of fire on that basis, I will know that fire is present.
Hence, if I know that I have seen a distinctive mark of fire and
inferred the presence of fire on that basis, I will know that my
inference yields knowledge. Finally, in the case of testimonial
knowledge, the &ldquo;sameness of sort&rdquo; on the basis of which
one could know that one knows consists in the relevant
awareness-episode&rsquo;s being a produced by the utterance of
reliable speaker. However, &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a constructs his
proposal only on the basis of Udayana&rsquo;s remarks about the
&ldquo;sameness of sort&rdquo; that grounds ascriptions of knowledge
to perceptual awareness-episodes.</p>

 This definition occurs at Kkh 30, where &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a
allows his opponent to clarify his definition and say that knowledge
involves awareness of an object as having a distinctive mark, which it
in fact has (<em>vi&#347;e&#7779;e&#7751;a sahitasya
pad&#257;rthasyopalambha&#7717;</em>). This rules out cases of error
from the scope of knowledge. For discussion of the earlier proposals,
see Granoff (1978: 32&ndash;34).</p>

 This argument needn&rsquo;t be convincing. In fact, as
&#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a himself acknowledges, there are proposals
that attempt to characterize the distinctive mark <i>X</i> in a more
unified manner. One of these proposals (which &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a
extrapolates from Udayana&rsquo;s discussion in <em>The Discrimination
of the Truth about the Self</em> (<em>&#256;tmatattvaviveka)</em>
(&#346;&#257;stri 1940: 317)) provides the following characterization
of the distinctive mark <i>X</i>: (i) when an agent isn&rsquo;t aware
of <i>X</i>, she can fall prey to doubt or error as to whether
<i>o</i> is <i>F</i>, (ii) when an agent becomes aware of <i>X</i>,
her doubt or erroneous awareness as to whether <i>o</i> is <i>F</i> is
rebutted (for the new awareness reveals a property of the object that
the agent missed earlier), and (iii) without accepting the existence
of <i>X</i>, one cannot distinguish truth about <i>o</i>&rsquo;s being
<i>F</i> from a falsehood about the same subject-matter (KKh 228).
However, according to &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a, it is unclear how this
proposal avoids the charge of non-uniformity raised earlier. Consider
a case of perceptual illusion where an agent mistakes a piece of
silver for a piece of tin. In such a scenario, if the agent later
notices that the piece of silver possesses the property of
<em>silverhood</em>, her new awareness may indeed rebut her previous
erroneous awareness. In this scenario, therefore, silverhood is the
distinctive mark, the awareness of which is necessary for knowing that
the relevant object is a piece of silver. However, silverhood cannot
play this role in a case where one mistakes a sea-shell for a piece of
silver: a renewed awareness of silverhood in such a scenario will only
end up confirming one&rsquo;s previous error. This, once again, shows
that the distinctive mark&mdash;the awareness of which is necessary
for knowledge&mdash;will vary from one scenario to another (KKh 231).
As &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a points out, this problem cannot be blocked
simply by requiring that the rebutting awareness be a piece of
knowledge. On the one hand, the charge of non-uniformity would still
stand. On the other hand, the definition would now be circular.</p>

 This definition of <em>causal condition</em> seems to resemble
Hume&rsquo;s (1748) regularity-based definition of <em>cause</em>: on
this picture, a causal condition is just an entity that regularly
precedes the effect (Ram-Prasad 2002: Section IV.1). However, it is
also significantly different from Hume&rsquo;s definition: the target
of Hume&rsquo;s definition is the notion of a cause, not the notion of
a causal condition. That is why Hume analyzes the notion in terms of
invariable succession, and not in terms of invariable precession: on
Hume&rsquo;s view, a cause is an event such that events similarly to
it are regularly <em>followed</em> by events similar to the
effect.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 It is tempting to argue that this is a counterfactual definition of
the notion of a causal condition similar in spirit to Lewis&rsquo;
(1973) analysis of causal
dependence. On one way of interpreting this definition, the definition
says that a causal condition for an effect <i>e</i> is an entity
without the presence of which the effect wouldn&rsquo;t be produced.
However, the definition could&mdash;somewhat anachronistically but
perhaps more naturally&mdash;be interpreted as saying that a causal
condition for an effect <i>e</i> is an entity <i>c</i> such that in
every nearby possibility where <i>e</i> is produced, <i>c</i> precedes
it. &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a&rsquo;s counterexample works for both
these readings: the color of the threads is an entity without which
the cloth couldn&rsquo;t be produced, and in every nearby possibility
where the cloth is produced, the color of the threads precedes it.</p>

 For discussion of &#346;a&#347;adhara&rsquo;s proposal, see Matilal
(1975: 45&ndash;46; 1976: 12). For an instance of how this proposal
was fleshed out later, see verse 16 of
<em>K&#257;rik&#257;val&#299;</em>, a standard textbook of later
Ny&#257;ya-Vai&#347;e&#7779;ika philosophy, where the author
Vi&#347;van&#257;tha defines a causal condition that which is
non-superfluous and invariably precedes the effect
(<em>anyath&#257;siddhi&#347;&#363;nya
niyatap&#363;rvavartit&#257;</em>). In his commentary
<em>Ny&#257;yasiddh&#257;ntamukt&#257;val&#299;</em> on verse 19 of
his <em>K&#257;rik&#257;val&#299;</em>, he goes on to describe five
different kinds of non-superfluity.</p>

 In fact, &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a offers two responses to this
objection. The first response (which occurs at KKh 75ff) is this. Even
if the deliverances of perception did conflict with the content of
Upanisadic testimony, a perceptual awareness-episode would only rebut
a part of that content: the part which talks about the
non-distinctness from the self of the objects that are presented in
the relevant perceptual awareness-episode. But we would still have a
default entitlement to think that Upanisadic testimony produces
knowledge with respect to the remainder of its content. If we grant
this, then it will be very hard to ward off the doctrine of
non-duality. For instance, even though a perceptual awareness-episode
may present a cloth as distinct from a pot, it may not present itself
as distinct from the perceived objects, namely the pot and the cloth.
So, it is possible for Upanisadic testimony to establish the identity
between the perceptual awarenesss-episode that there is a difference
between the pot and the cloth, and the objects&mdash;the pot and the
cloth&mdash;that are presented in perception. This in turn would clear
room for the doctrine of non-duality. This is precisely the conclusion
that &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a wants: a perceptual awareness-episode
cannot really rebut scriptural testimony. The argument seems a bit
quick; especially, the premise that even though the content of
perceptual awareness may contradict a part of the content of
Upanisadic testimony, one could still be entitled to treat Upanisadic
testimony as reliable with respect to rest of its content. One might
think that the fact that Upanisadic sentences give us false
information in one domain gives us some reason to thinking that it may
be unreliable in other domains. But &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a never
addresses this worry.</p>

 This principle is inspired by a thesis that the Indian Buddhist
philosopher Dharmak&#299;rti (6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> century
CE) endorses in <em>The Ascertainment of Epistemology</em>
(<em>Pram&#257;&#7751;avini&#347;caya</em>): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For someone who isn&rsquo;t directly aware of her own awareness, a
direct awareness of the object isn&rsquo;t established either
(<em>apratyak&#7779;opalambhasya n&#257;rthad&#7771;&#7779;ti&#7717;
prasiddhyati</em>). (KKh 45; <em>Pram&#257;&#7751;avini&#347;caya</em>
1.54cd) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The argument that follows, quite unsurprisingly, resembles a regress
argument that Dharmak&#299;rti offers in that text (Kellner 2011).</p>

 Before &#346;r&#299;har&#7779;a, other classical Indian
philosophers&mdash;such as Kum&#257;rila, &#346;a&#7747;kara, and
Jayanta&mdash;have discussed versions of Meno&rsquo;s paradox
(Carpenter &amp; Ganeri 2010). Consider, for instance,
&#346;a&#7747;kara&rsquo;s variant of the puzzle (Shastri 1980:
79&ndash;83). B&#257;dar&#257;ya&#7751;a&rsquo;s <em>Aphorisms on the
Brahman</em> begins with the sentence, &ldquo;Now, therefore, [begins]
an inquiry into the <em>Brahman</em>&rdquo;. In his commentary,
&#346;a&#7747;kara poses the following dilemma: either it is
well-known (<em>prasiddha</em>) what the Brahman is, or it is not so
(<em>aprasiddha</em>). If it is well known what the Brahman is, then
genuine inquiry will be impossible; for there will be no open question
to settle. If it is not so well known what the Brahman is, even then
genuine inquiry will be impossible; for the inquirer, then,
won&rsquo;t quite know what it is that she is inquiring after.
&#346;a&#7747;kara resolves the puzzle by pointing out that the nature
of the Brahman is partly known: the etymology of the word
&ldquo;Brahman&rdquo; tells us that it is pure and eternal, the
Upani&#7779;ads tell us that it is identical to the self, and everyone
knows of the existence of his or her self. This information&mdash;even
though it specifies the object of inquiry&mdash;is insufficient to
settle the question of what Brahman is; for there is still a lot of
disagreement about the nature of the self, and in effect, about the
nature of the Brahman. The task for the inquirer is to adjudicate
amongst the different views about the self, so as to discover the true
nature of Brahman. This, effectively, resolves the puzzle.</p>

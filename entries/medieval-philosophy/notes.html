<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Medieval Philosophy</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>  The more common form
&lsquo;<em>medium aevum</em>&rsquo; emerged later (Robinson [1984],
p. 748). Robinson's delightful paper also discusses the demonstrably
false claim that English is the
<em>only</em> language to refer to this period in the plural (&ldquo;Middle
Ages&rdquo;) (<em>Ibid.,</em> pp. 747&ndash;49). St. Augustine does refer
to an &ldquo;age in between&rdquo; (<em>interim saeculum</em>), and Julian of
Toledo in the seventh century describes his own day as a &ldquo;middle time&rdquo;
(<em>tempus medium</em>). But they were thinking of the entire period
between the Incarnation and Judgment Day, so that the expressions have
a more theological than historical sense (<em>Ibid.,</em>
p. 749).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>  It is relevant to point out that
Robinson is talking about the Middle Ages in general, not about
medieval philosophy in particular. There is no antecedent reason to
regard the medieval period in philosophy as coinciding exactly with
the medieval period in, say, architecture or literature.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>  The key word here is
&lsquo;predominant&rsquo;. The practice is still alive and thriving
among quite respectable philosophers in our own day, even if it no
longer sets the tone of philosophy generally. Indeed, one of the
enduring legacies of medieval philosophy is the development of what we
call &ldquo;philosophy of religion,&rdquo; which can be pursued both
by those with and by those without prior doctrinal
commitments. Historians of medieval philosophy have sometimes felt a
need to defend, or have even been embarrassed by, this close
connection between philosophy and dogma in the Middle Ages, as though
it somehow compromised the integrity of their subject. But such
concerns are probably misplaced. The popular notion of the philosopher
as someone who follows the dictates of &ldquo;pure reason&rdquo;
wherever they may go, without regard for prior &ldquo;givens&rdquo;
that have to be accommodated, is something of a naive idealization;
throughout its history, philosophy at large has rarely if ever
proceeded in this purely autonomous way. One might in fact argue that
in our own day it is scientific theory rather than theological
doctrine that provides the standard against which much philosophy is
measured.  Not long ago, for example, some eminent and highly
respected philosophers were arguing that distribution laws of
classical logic itself must be abandoned because they could not be
reconciled with certain interpretations of quantum mechanics (note:
not that they could not be reconciled with empirical data, but that
they were irreconcilable with certain scientific <em>theories</em> to
interpret those data). Still, just as today there are many areas where
one can philosophize freely without fear of trespassing on scientific
ground, so too there were many areas of medieval philosophy where one
could speculate freely without worrying about theological
doctrine. The situations are altogether parallel, so that historians
of medieval philosophy need not feel apologetic or defensive about the
theological commitments of the philosophy of their period.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>  Here I am not distinguishing the
&ldquo;Platonism&rdquo; of Plato himself from the later Platonic
tradition, including Plotinus and others. The Middle Ages did not
distinguish them either.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>  One can see the realization of this
problem already in the second-century Christian Justin Martyr. See the
&ldquo;Prologue&rdquo; (Chaps. 1&ndash;9) to his <em>Dialogue with
Trypho, a Jew</em>
 [<a href="http://pvspade.com/Logic/docs/justin.pdf" target="other">Available online in PDF</a>].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>  This simplified account obviously
leaves out many nuances, not the least of which is that Platonism and
Aristotelianism were not the only pagan philosophies available. Still
this sketch will suffice to illustrate the kinds of difficulties a
Christian philosopher would have to face in dealing with his
philosophical heritage from antiquity.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>  On Calcidius, see the extensive
discussion in Gersh [1986], Chap. 6 (pp. 421&ndash;92).  There is
considerable uncertainty about Calcidius's identity, and even about
the date of his translation, which has been put anywhere from the
first half of the fourth century to the early fifth century. In any
event, it is fairly certain that Calcidius was a Christian. On all
these questions, see <em>ibid</em>., pp. 421&ndash;34.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>  Klibansky [1982], p. 27, says these
translations were available from about 1156, and remarks that the
translation of the <em>Phaedo</em> was &ldquo;later
revised.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p> 

<a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a> Thus Gilson [1955], p. 623 n. 80,
says, &ldquo;The influence of these two texts was hardly perceptible even in
the XIIIth century.&rdquo; On the other hand, Klibansky [1982], pp.  27&ndash;28,
says, &ldquo;these works had a wider circulation than the comparatively
small number of extant manuscripts would
presuppose. The <em>Phaedo</em> and, to a lesser extent,
the <em>Meno</em> were read by Roger Bacon and by Parisian schoolmen
who from 1271 had a manuscript of the former dialogue at their
disposal in the library of the Sorbonne. They were quoted about 1300
by the Paduan judge, Jeremiah da Montagnone, by the Franciscan John of
Wales at Oxford and by Henry Bate of Malines; later, by the Dominican
Bertold of Moosburg and by the chancellor of Edward III, Richard de
Bury; excerpts are found in collections of exempla and sayings.&rdquo; He
goes on to mention yet further citations. Still, while all this goes
to show that there were manuscripts available throughout a broad area,
and that some people actually read these texts, it does not do much to
show any real <em>influence</em> of these dialogues. No one appears to
have commented on them, for example.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p> 

<a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a> On Victorinus, see Armstrong
[1970], Chap. 20 (pp. 331&ndash;40). Readers of
Augustine's <em>Confessions</em> will perhaps recall Victorinus
from <em>Confessions</em> VIII.2 and VIII.4. Our only evidence that
Victorinus really did translate Plotinus comes from
Augustine's <em>Confessions</em> VIII.2.3, where he says that
Victorinus translated the &ldquo;books of the Platonists&rdquo; mentioned back at
VII.9.13. But nothing in what Augustine says requires that those
&ldquo;books&rdquo; were Plotinus's in particular. Augustine certainly knew about
Plotinus's views, but how much of them he actually read in direct
translation is unclear. For a summary of the question, with references
to further literature, see James J. O'Donnell's commentary on
Augustine, <em>Confessions,</em> VII.9.13 and VII.2.3 (Augustine
[1992], vol. 2, pp. 421&ndash;424, and vol. 3, pp. 13&ndash;15).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>  The passage is worth quoting more
fully: &ldquo;The more one studies the middle ages, the more one
notices the polymorphism of the Platonic influence. Plato himself does
not appear at all, but Platonism is everywhere; let us say rather that
there are Platonisms everywhere.&rdquo; (Gilson [1955], p. 144.)  He
then goes on to list several different kinds of broadly Platonic
theories up into the twelfth century. The point, of course, is that
&ldquo;Platonism&rdquo; in this context should not be thought of as a
single, monolithic set of doctrines.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>  Competitors include Confucius and
the Buddha.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>  One might argue that the so
called &ldquo;Cassiciacum Dialogues&rdquo; are exceptions. These
include his <em>Soliloquies,</em> and the <em>Contra academicos</em>
(=
<em>Against the Academicians</em>), <em>De beata vita</em> (= <em>On
the Blessed</em> [or <em>Happy</em>] <em>Life</em>), and <em>De
ordine</em> (= <em>On Order</em>). The <em>De dialectica</em>
(=&nbsp;<em>On Dialectic</em></p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>  Strictly speaking there was no
&ldquo;emperor&rdquo; in the West after the year 476.  Theodoric was
never emperor but &ldquo;king,&rdquo; in fact a kind of barbarian
warlord although his administration was nevertheless known for its
enlightened patronage of culture. The Ostrogoths were also Arian
Christians, whereas Boethius and the old Roman families were not.
Perhaps the conspiracy Boethius was accused of had something to do
with plans to free the West of barbarian rule and restoring it to the
orthodox old Roman families. But the facts are unclear.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p> 
<a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a> Marius Victorinus had already
translated the same three texts in the fourth century (Dod [1982]),
but those translations were lost. The first of Boethius's two
commentaries on Porphyry's <em>Isagoge</em> is &ldquo;based on&rdquo; Victorinus's
translation, but it is not clear just how much of the text of that
translation is preserved in Boethius's commentary.</p>

</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a> &lsquo;Eriugena&rsquo; means
&ldquo;born in Ireland.&rdquo; &lsquo;Scotus' means &ldquo;the
Scot.&rdquo; So the name as a whole means &ldquo;John the Scot, the
Irishman.&rdquo; This doesn't sound quite so odd once it is realized
that, at the time, Ireland was known as &ldquo;Scotia Major.&rdquo;
John is sometimes simply called &ldquo;John the Scot,&rdquo; but do
not confuse him with the more famous John Duns Scotus
(c. 1265&ndash;1308).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>  Eriugena was not the first to
translate these texts. An earlier translation was done c. 832 by one
Hilduin (d. 840), abbot of St. Denis, who had been educated at the
Carolingian school by Alcuin (d. 840). But Eriugena's translations
were much more influential.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>  The odd name &lsquo;ontological
argument&rsquo; is not used by Anselm himself, and comes instead from
Kant.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>  Augustine's <em>Confessions</em>
comes to mind for comparison, although the two works are quite
different in tone and content.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>  A good example can be found in
Augustine's odd &ldquo;proof&rdquo; for the existence of God in <em>De
libero arbitrio</em> (= &nbsp;<em>On Free Choice of the Will</em>),
II.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>  With this section, see Dod
[1982].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>  The &ldquo;palace school&rdquo;
associated with the Carolingian court does not quite fit into the
following generalization.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>  I say &ldquo;may have been&rdquo;
because there has been some scholarly dispute over whether there was a
real &ldquo;school&rdquo; at all at this time in Chartres, and if so,
whether it was a cathedral school. Nevertheless, there is universal
agreement that the people about to be mentioned were all associated
with Chartres, and were all important figures.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>  Despite its intriguing title,
John's <em>Metalogicon</em> has nothing whatever to do with metalogic
in the present-day sense of the term.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>  The expression &lsquo;secular
clergy&rsquo; is sometimes confusing to modern ears. The distinction
is between the &ldquo;secular clergy&rdquo; and the &ldquo;regular
clergy.&rdquo; The latter are the clergy who belong to an organized
religious order, living under a <em>regula</em> or &ldquo;rule,&rdquo;
such as the famous sixth-century Rule of St. Benedict for Benedictine
monks.  Particularly during the early Middle Ages, those in religious
orders tended to live together in communities (the monasteries), in a
kind of retirement from the world. By contrast, the &ldquo;secular
clergy&rdquo; lived out in the world (the &ldquo;age&rdquo;
or <em>saeculum</em>), tending to the flock of the faithful. In the
thirteenth century, &ldquo;mendicant&rdquo; or &ldquo;begging&rdquo;
orders were founded who were just as much out in the world as the
secular clergy were, but who nevertheless belonged to the
&ldquo;regular clergy&rdquo; because they were governed by a
&ldquo;rule.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>  A perhaps not altogether
inappropriate analogy can be found in the modern political party
system. In the United States, for example, both major parties
continually appeal to the heroes of their past, who affect thinking
even today and who can be regarded as helping to define the parties'
&ldquo;identities.&rdquo;</p>

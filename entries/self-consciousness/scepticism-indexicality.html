<h2>Scepticism About Essential Indexicality &amp; Agency</h2>

<p>
Cappelen and Dever&rsquo;s (2013; cf. Millikan 1990; Magidor 2015)
attack on essential indexicality has generated a significant
literature. This is especially so regarding their claim that, as they
put it, &ldquo;there are no interesting or distinctive explanatory
connections between indexicality and agency&rdquo; (2013: 18). Their
central target is the claim, which we can call
&ldquo;Necessity&rdquo;, that indexical thoughts (beliefs, desires, or
intentions) are required for the explanation or rationalisation of
action. True, they argue, it is a self-conscious I-thought that spurs
Perry&rsquo;s messy shopper into action, but this hardly shows that
<em>all</em> action rationalisation requires such indexical thought.
They argue (2013: 37) that if Necessity is true, then the following
&ldquo;Impersonal Incompleteness Claim&rdquo; is true:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt><strong>IIC</strong>:</dt>
<dd> Impersonal action rationalizations are necessarily incomplete
because of a missing indexical component.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
An impersonal action rationalisation is one that at no point cites an
indexical thought. Cappelen and Dever consider a number of arguments
in favour of IIC, arguing that each fails. To sharpen the discussion
they provide several examples, central among which is that of
Fran&ccedil;ois ducking to avoid being shot. A proponent of essential
indexicality might attribute the following in a rationalisation of
Fran&ccedil;ois&rsquo; action: the belief &ldquo;I am about to be
shot&rdquo;, the desire &ldquo;I not be shot&rdquo;, and the belief
&ldquo;If I duck I&rdquo;ll not be shot&rsquo;. This involves
attributing first-personal thoughts to Fran&ccedil;ois. The
<em>impersonal</em> action rationalisation that Cappelen and Dever
propose (2013: 36) replaces occurrences of the first-person with a
proper name referring to the agent, as follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">
<dt><strong>Belief 1</strong>:</dt>
<dd> Fran&ccedil;ois is about to be shot.</dd>
<dt><strong>Desire 1</strong>:</dt>
<dd> Fran&ccedil;ois not be shot.</dd>
<dt><strong>Belief 2</strong>:</dt>
<dd> If Fran&ccedil;ois ducks, he will not be shot</dd>
</dl>

<p>
One way to think about Capellen and Dever&rsquo;s argument against
Necessity is as a challenge to show that this rationalisation is
incomplete, and that it is so due to a missing indexical element.</p>

<p>
This challenge is taken up by Berm&uacute;dez (2016, 2017) whose
argument can be simplified as follows: </p>

<ol type="i">

<li> no rationalisation can be complete if an agent can hold every
propositional attitude yet not act, </li>

<li> it is possible to hold every propositional attitude in an
impersonal action rationalisation yet not act since one believes that
one is not the person referred to in the rationalisation
(Berm&uacute;dez 2017: 15).</li>
</ol>

<p>
It follows that impersonal action rationalisations are incomplete,
thus vindicating the first conjunct of IIC.</p>

<p>
Morgan (2019) argues that this argument fails for the reason that the
sceptic about Necessity can reasonably reject (ii). Among the
criticisms that Morgan directs at (ii) is the point that
Berm&uacute;dez has not ruled out the possibility that what
Millikan (1990) calls &ldquo;active self-names&rdquo; are responsible
for action. An active self-name is a name, in the language of thought,
which &ldquo;names a person whom I know, under that name, <em>how</em>
to manipulate directly; I <em>know how</em> to affect her
behaviour&rdquo; (Millikan 1990: 730). And, as she rhetorically asks,
&ldquo;What has know how to do with indexicality?&rdquo; (Millikan
1990: 730). On Millikan&rsquo;s view, even though active self-names
may be expressed in language by the word &ldquo;I&rdquo;, they are not
themselves indexical since their reference is not determined by the
context of production. On such a view, the idea that I believe that I
am not the person referred to in the (active self-name employing)
rationalisation amounts to the, dubiously coherent, idea that I
believe that I am not me.</p>

<p>
On Morgan&rsquo;s (2019) view, although Berm&uacute;dez&rsquo;s
argument fails, an analogous argument concerning temporal indexicals
succeeds, for the reason that it is not plausible that there could be
a non-indexical item in the language of thought that can do the work
that we would otherwise attribute to now-thought. This argument, and
Berm&uacute;dez&rsquo;s original argument, are subject to the
objection that (i) is false since all manner of things can defeat an
action. No matter what propositional attitudes an agent holds, they
will not act if, for example, they are paralysed, or if they are
weak-willed, or if they believe that they are incapable of acting.
This point is made by Magidor, who notes that &ldquo;hard-wired,
physiological constraints&rdquo; (2015: 262) can mean that two
subjects with all the same beliefs can end up performing quite
different actions. Of course, (i) might be revised to rule out such
defeaters but it will then be pointed out that (ii) works by adding in
a defeater (the belief that I am not the person referred to in the
explanation).</p>

<p>
A different approach is taken by Ninan (2016) and Torre (2018), both
of whom focus on the capacity of impersonal action explanations to
account for the fact that two agents can hold all the same (relevant)
propositional attitudes and yet one act while the other does not (also
see Garc&iacute;a-Carpintero 2017). Suppose that both Fran&ccedil;ois
and Anais both hold beliefs 1 and 2, and desire 1. What, then, could
account for the fact that Fran&ccedil;ois ducks while Anais runs for
help? According to the defender of Necessity we might suppose the
difference is explained by self-consciousness, by the fact that
Fran&ccedil;ois also believes that he himself is Fran&ccedil;ois, a
belief that he would express first-personally, while Anais does
not.</p>

<p>
Capellen and Dever, aware of this issue, propose the &ldquo;Action
Inventory Model&rdquo; (2013: &sect;3.9) according to which the fact
that Fran&ccedil;ois ducks, whereas Anais does not, is explained by
the fact that <em>Fran&ccedil;ois ducks</em> is an action that is
available to Fran&ccedil;ois but not to Anais. The difference, on this
view, is not explained by any difference in their propositional
attitudes but rather in what actions are available to them. As Magidor
puts essentially the same point, &ldquo;Jack lifts Jack&rsquo;s legs
to run while Jill lifts Jill&rsquo;s legs to run&rdquo; (2015:
262).</p>

<p>
Ninan (2016) objects to this view on the grounds that such
agent-specific action types (e.g. <em>Fran&ccedil;ois ducks</em> or
<em>Lifts Jack&rsquo;s Legs</em>) are necessarily such that no two
agents could ever perform them. But we also have a notion of
agent-neutral action types (e.g. <em>ducks</em>), allowing us to
think of two agents as performing the same action (cf. Verdejo
2020; Valente 2018). Further, given that <em>ducks</em> is an
action available to both Fran&ccedil;ois and Anais, the Action
Inventory Model cannot explain why Fran&ccedil;ois ducks but Anais
does not. Torre (2018) offers a different objection to the Action
Inventory Model, claiming that the availability of <em>Fran&ccedil;ois
ducks</em> is not sufficient to explain the action. Rather what is
required is the first-personal belief that <em>Fran&ccedil;ois
ducks</em> is one of one&rsquo;s own available actions. After all,
Torre argues, it may be that Anais has the magical power to perform
<em>Fran&ccedil;ois ducks</em> yet is ignorant of this fact. In such a
circumstance it seems implausible to suppose that Anais will perform
the action since ignorance seems to stand in the way of action (a
distinct, though related, argument for a version of Necessity can be
found in Prosser 2015). Once more, the conclusion we are invited to
draw is that the Action Inventory Model fails.</p>

<p>
Another defence of Necessity comes in the form of the claim that the
practical reasoning and/or intention required for action is
necessarily first-personal (Babb 2016; Gjelsvik 2017; cf. Hunter
2017). Although there are different lines of thought here, the central
idea is that practical reasoning is essentially reasoning about what
<em>one</em> will do and its outcome, intention, is only satisfied if
<em>one</em> so acts, where these both require first-personal
readings. Since the propositional attitudes appealed to in the above
impersonal action rationalisation are not the sorts of things that can
engage one&rsquo;s deliberation about what <em>one</em> is to do and
could not eventuate in intentions regarding what <em>one</em> is to
do, it follows that impersonal action rationalisations are incomplete
(also see
 <a href="index-2.html#SelfConsRati">&sect;4.2 Self-Consciousness and Rationality</a>).
 Proponents of this view need to show that such first person
formulations really are necessary. This may involve doing more than
arguing that the content is not as described by Cappelen and Dever
(e.g., Intend that: Fran&ccedil;ois ducks) since, on the face of it,
there are two alternatives: one may think that the content of the
relevant intention is first-personal (e.g. Intend that: I duck) or,
adjusting the above point from Ninan (2016), that it is impersonal
(e.g., Intend: to duck) (for discussion of such issues, see Morgan
2018).</p>

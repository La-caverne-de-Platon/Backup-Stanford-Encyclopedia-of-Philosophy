<h2><a id="PreNotPro">1. Prehistory of the notion of proof</a></h2>
    
<p>

Proof theory can be described as the study of the general structure 
of mathematical proofs, and of arguments with demonstrative force as 
encountered in logic. The idea of such demonstrative arguments, i.e.,
ones the conclusion of which follows necessarily from the assumptions
made, is central in Aristotle's <i>Analytica Posteriora</i>: a 
deductive science is organised around a number of basic concepts that
are assumed understood without further explanation, and a number of 
basic truths or axioms that are seen as true immediately. Defined 
concepts and theorems are reduced to these two, the latter through 
proof. Aristotle's account of proof as demonstrative argument fits 
very well to the structure of ancient geometry as axiomatized in 
Euclid. The specific form of 
 <a href="../aristotle-logic/index.html" target="other">Aristotle's logic</a>,
 the theory of syllogism has instead, so it seems, almost nothing to 
do with proofs in Euclidean geometry. These proofs remained intuitive
for more than two thousand years.</p>

<p>

Before the work of Frege in 1879, no one seems to have maintained that
there could be a complete set of principles of proof, in the sense
expressed by Frege when he wrote that in his symbolic language,
</p>

<blockquote><p>
all that is necessary for a correct inference is expressed in
full, but what is not necessary is generally not indicated; nothing is
left to guesswork.
(<i>Begriffsschrift</i>, p. 3)</p></blockquote>

<p>
 (One might contend that Boole is an
exception as far as classical propositional logic is concerned.)
Frege's step ahead was decisive for the development of logic and
foundational study. The contrast to the ancients is great: Aristotle
gave a pattern for combining arguments, but the idea of a finite
closed set of rules was, philosophically, beyond the dreams of anyone
before Frege, with the possible exception of Leibniz.</p>

<p>

As we know today, Frege's principles of proof are complete for 
classical predicate logic.</p>

<p>
Around 1890, Giuseppe Peano gave a formalization of logical inference,
with the aim of representing formally proofs in arithmetic. His
seminal paper <i>Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita</i>,
written originally in Latin, is included in English translation in the
collection <i> From Frege to G&ouml;del</i> (1967) that Jean van Heijenoort
edited. Unfortunately, the editor failed to recognize what Peano did
with formal inference, and the view spread that Peano formalized only
the language of logic and arithmetic, not its principles of proof. If
Peano's proofs are read with even a little care, it transpires that
they are purely formal derivations that use two principles:</p>
<ol>
<li> Axioms imply their instances. Such implications can be written as lines in
proofs.</li>
<li> An implication and its antecedent imply together the
consequent. </li>
</ol><p>
Peano is very careful to list, on every line of his
derivations, what the formal ground for writing the line is.</p>

<p>
 <a href="../russell/index.html" target="other">Russell</a>
 took up Frege's logic, but used the notation and formal rules of
proof of Peano, in a paper of 1906 with the title &ldquo;The theory of
implication.&rdquo;  Its formal machinery is exactly the same as
Peano's. In later work, Russell changed the axiomatic system and the
one of <i>Principia Mathematica</i> (Whitehead and Russell 1910&ndash;13) became
standard. Russell's philosophical idea, and here he followed Frege,
was that the axioms express basic logical truths, and other logical
truths are derived from these through modus ponens and universal
generalization, the two principles Frege had identified. Mathematics
was to be reduced to logic, so that its proofs would become presented
in the same axiomatic pattern.</p>

<p>

Frege's and Peano-Russell's approach to logic became the universally 
accepted one, especially through the influence of Hilbert and his 
co-workers in the 1920s. In the 19th century, Frege was a marginal 
figure, and the algebraic approach to logic, as in Boole and 
especially Ernst Schr&ouml;der, was the dominant one. It is clear 
that there was a good understanding of the principles of predicate 
logic in this tradition, for how could there have been a 
L&ouml;wenheim-Skolem theorem otherwise? Skolem found out about 
Frege's logic through <i>Principia Mathematica</i> only after having 
worked out the theorem in his paper of 1920. The first section of 
that paper, widely read because of the English translation in Van 
Heijenoort's <i>From Frege to G&ouml;del</i>, marks the end of the 
algebraic tradition of logic that merged silently with lattice 
theory. Other sections of the paper contain a remarkable beginning of
the analysis of proofs in lattice theory and in projective geometry: 
Skolem considered the axioms of a mathematical theory from a purely 
combinatorial and formal point of view, as means for producing 
derivations of a formula from given formulas used as assumptions. It 
was found out in the early 1990s that the part on lattice theory 
contains the solution of a decision problem, called the word problem 
for freely generated lattices, the known solution of which stemmed 
from 1988! Skolem's terminology and notation in lattice theory are 
those of Schr&ouml;der and that is part of the reason why his work 
was a lost opportunity for proof theory.</p>

<h2><a id="HilOldAxiProThe">2. Hilbert's old axiomatic proof theory</a></h2>
 
<p>

Hilbert's book <i>Grundlagen der Geometrie</i> of 1899 set the stage
for the central foundational problems of mathematics of the early
decades of the 20th century. We can list these problems as
follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>The formalization of a mathematical theory. This includes a choice
of its basic objects and relations, and a choice of the axioms.</li>
<li>A proof of the consistency of the axioms.</li>
<li>The question of the mutual independence and completeness of the
axioms.</li>
<li>The decision problem: is there a method for answering any question
that could be raised within the theory?</li>
</ol>

<p>

As to Hilbert's geometry, its attempted formalization fell short of
the ideal to which it gave birth. Hilbert found a much more important
field to which his &ldquo;metamathematics&rdquo; was to be applied,
namely arithmetic and analysis. The groundwork was a study of the four
foundational problems in axiomatic formulations of pure logic.
Propositional logic was thus formalized, found to be consistent and
complete, and decidable. The first results about predicate logic are
from 1915, when Leopold L&ouml;wenheim gave his version of what later
became the L&ouml;wenheim-Skolem theorem for predicate logic (see the entry
on <a href="../logic-classical/index.html" target="other">classical logic</a>).
He also solved special cases of the decision problem. This development
was independent of the Frege-Russell tradition, and was instead based
on the algebraic approach to logic of Ernst Schr&ouml;der. Around 1920, the
&ldquo;Hilbert style&rdquo; axiomatic approach, as it is often called,
was known to everyone and dominated the logical scene; the algebraic
approach merged almost without notice with lattice theory. By 1928, in
Hilbert and Ackermann's <i>Grundz&uuml;ge der theoretischen Logik</i>, an
axiomatic formal system for predicate logic was presented, together
with the problem of its completeness. The latter was solved by G&ouml;del
in 1929, published a year later (G&ouml;del 1930). The fourth
foundational problem, the decision problem for predicate logic, was
shown to have a negative solution in a short paper by Church in 1936
as a corollary to G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorem.</p>

<p>

Hilbert and his school, with Bernays, Ackermann and von Neumann as 
foremost, as well as young Herbrand in France, pursued the 
metamathematical study of arithmetic in the latter part of the 1920s.
Hilbert developed a method for the study of consistency problems, 
called the 
 <a href="../epsilon-calculus/index.html" target="other">epsilon substitution method</a>,
 to deal with the quantifiers. He felt that indirect inferences with 
quantifiers in cases with an infinity of objects were the crucial 
point of consistency proofs and needed a justification. Say, if the 
assumption that all natural numbers have the property <em>P</em> 
leads to an impossibility, the existence of a number with the 
contrary property not-<em>P</em> can be inferred. The central problem
was thus to justify the use of classical logic in mathematical 
proofs, arithmetical ones in the first place. Ackermann was very 
close to a solution towards the end of the 1920s and optimism reigned
in the Hilbert school. Then, of course, the unexpected happened when 
G&ouml;del proved the impossibility of a complete formalization of 
elementary arithmetic, and, as it was soon interpreted, the 
impossibility of proving the consistency of arithmetic by finitary 
means, the only ones judged &ldquo;absolutely reliable&rdquo; by 
Hilbert.</p>

<h2><a id="UnpCon">3. The unprovability of consistency</a></h2>

<p>

After G&ouml;del had made public the incompleteness of arithmetic in
September 1930, von Neumann found that the consistency of arithmetic
would be among the G&ouml;delian unprovable propositions. Alas, G&ouml;del had
made the same discovery so von Neumann never published his proof. He
did, however, conjecture in correspondence with G&ouml;del the
unprovability of the consistency of arithmetic and therefore of
mathematics as a whole, in some absolute sense. Von Neumann was the
key character in the reception of G&ouml;del's results: He interrupted his
lectures on Hilbert's proof theory in Berlin in the fall of 1930 to
explain the new discoveries. These events created an enormous
excitement among the mathematicians, as witnessed by Carl Hempel's
testimony:</p>

<blockquote>
I took a course there with von Neumann which dealt with Hilbert's
attempt to prove the consistency of classical mathematics by finitary
means. I recall that in the middle of the course von Neumann came in
one day and announced that he had just received a paper from&hellip; Kurt
G&ouml;del who showed that the objectives which Hilbert had in mind
and on which I had heard Hilbert's course in G&ouml;ttingen could not
be achieved at all. Von Neumann, therefore, dropped the pursuit of
this subject and devoted the rest of the course to the presentation of
G&ouml;del's results.  The finding evoked an enormous excitement.
(Hempel 2000, p. 13)
</blockquote>

<p>

In 1932&ndash;33, G&ouml;del and Gentzen found independently of each 
other a translation from classical Peano arithmetic to 
 <a href="../logic-intuitionistic/index.html" target="other">intuitionistic Heyting arithmetic</a>.
 Specifically, it shows that if a contradiction is provable in the 
former, it is provable in the latter. Then the consistency of 
intuitionistic arithmetic would guarantee also the consistency of 
classical arithmetic. This result was a surprise: as mentioned, 
Hilbert had thought that the &ldquo;transfinite&rdquo; indirect 
existence proofs would be the part of arithmetic that needs to be 
secured of contradiction. By G&ouml;del's and Gentzen's result, 
already intuitionistic arithmetic contained principles that went 
beyond finitary reasoning. A letter Gentzen wrote to Heyting on 25 
February 1933 summarizes the situation as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
A consistency proof by finite means has &hellip; not succeeded so far,
so that this original aim of Hilbert has not been achieved. If, on the
other hand, one admits the intuitionistic position as a secure basis
in itself, i.e., as a consistent one, the consistency of classical
arithmetic is secured by my result. If one wished to satisfy Hilbert's
requirements, the task would still remain of showing intuitionistic
arithmetic consistent. This, however, is not possible by even the
formal apparatus of classical arithmetic, on the basis of G&ouml;del's
result in combination with my proof. Even so, I am inclined to believe
that a consistency proof for intuitionistic arithmetic, from an even
more evident position, is possible and also desirable. (Menzler-Trott
2007, p. 38)
</blockquote>

<p>

The last-mentioned was the goal Gentzen had set to himself early in 
1932, when in a letter to his old teacher Hellmuth Kneser he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
I have set as my specific task to find a proof of the consistency of
logical deduction in arithmetic&hellip; The task becomes a purely
mathematical problem through the formalization of logical
deduction. The proof of consistency has been so far carried out only
for special cases, for example, the arithmetic of the integers without
the rule of complete induction. I would like to proceed further at
this point and to clear at least arithmetic with complete induction. I
am working on this since almost a year and hope to finish soon, and
would then present this work as my dissertation (with Prof. Bernays).
(Menzler-Trott 2007, p. 31)
</blockquote>
 

<h2><a id="NatDedSeqCal">4. Natural deduction and sequent calculus</a></h2>

<p>

In pursuing his consistency program, Gentzen set as his first task the
analysis of purely logical deduction, to be extended later to
arithmetic and analysis. In his thesis (1934&ndash;1935), Gentzen
states that he set as his task the analysis of mathematical proofs as
they occur in practice.  The first observation is that actual proofs
are not based on axioms expressed in a logical language, as in
Hilbert's axiomatic proof theory. The most typical feature is instead
that theorems make their claims under some assumptions. The
assumptions are analyzed into parts and the conclusion is also
analyzed into parts until these two analyses meet and a proof can be
synthesized.  The latter analysis proceeds by what Gentzen called
introduction rules: they give sufficient conditions for deriving a
proposition of a given form. For example, to derive a conjunction
<span class="nw"><i>A</i> &amp; <i>B</i>,</span> it is sufficient to
derive the conjuncts <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> separately. The
inference is given formally as in the rule</p>

<blockquote>
<table style="border-collapse:collapse;">
<tr><td style="padding:0px;border-bottom:1px solid black; text-align:center;">
  <em>A</em> &nbsp; <em>B</em> 
</td><td rowspan="2">
&nbsp;&amp;I
</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center;">
  <em>A</em> &amp; <em>B</em> 
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Assumptions, instead, are analyzed into their components through 
elimination rules that give, by and large, immediate consequences of 
the assumptions. For example, a conjunction used as an assumption can
be decomposed into its constituents, as in the rules</p>

<blockquote>
   <table>
   <tr><td>

<table style="border-collapse:collapse;">
<tr><td style="padding:0px;border-bottom:1px solid black; text-align:center;">
  <em>A</em> &amp; <em>B</em> 
</td><td rowspan="2">
&nbsp;&amp;E<sub>1</sub>
</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center;">
  <em>A</em>
</td></tr>
</table>

   </td><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td>

<table style="border-collapse:collapse;">
<tr><td style="padding:0px;border-bottom:1px solid black; text-align:center;">
  <em>A</em> &amp; <em>B</em> 
</td><td rowspan="2">
&nbsp;&amp;E<sub>2</sub>
</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center;">
  <em>B</em>
</td></tr>
</table>

   </td></tr>
   </table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Gentzen developed and studied the system of natural deduction during 
1932, and had arrived by September 1932 at a calculus of natural 
deduction (ND for short) that is standard today. By this time, he had
noticed that if an introduction, say a derivation of 
<span class="nw"><em>A</em> &amp; <em>B</em></span> from <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> separately, 
is followed by the corresponding elimination, say a derivation of 
<em>A</em>, the formula <span class="nw"><em>A</em> &amp; <em>B</em></span> constitutes a local
maximum, a &ldquo;hillock&rdquo;, that can be eliminated. He also 
called such hillocks &ldquo;detours&rdquo;, and what is now called a 
detour conversion removes such unnecessary pairs of 
introduction-elimination steps. The result of the steps of 
&ldquo;normalization&rdquo; is a derivation in &ldquo;normal 
form&rdquo;.</p>

<p>

Implication is perhaps more typical of ND than conjunction: to derive
<span class="nw"><em>A</em> &sup; <em>B</em></span>, one temporarily assumes <em>A</em>, then 
tries to derive <em>B</em>. If this succeeds, the temporary 
assumption is closed or &ldquo;discharged&rdquo; when the conclusion 
to <span class="nw"><em>A</em> &sup; <em>B</em></span> is made, as in the schematic derivation</p>

<p>

If rule 
<span class="nw">&sup;I</span> is followed by <span class="nw">&sup;E,</span>
 there is a non-normality that 
is removed by a detour conversion: a derivation of <em>B</em> (and 
what follows after it) is constructed by taking the derivation of the
minor premiss <em>A</em> of the elimination rule and the derivation 
of <em>B</em> from the assumption <em>A</em> in the introduction. 
These two pieces are combined together into a derivation of 
<em>B</em> that does not have the detour formula 
<span class="nw"><em>A</em> &sup; <em>B</em></span>. In Gentzen's thesis, all assumptions are 
in the end closed by implication introductions, but nowadays one 
considers also derivations that leave a collection of formulas as 
open assumptions.</p>

<p>

Looking at the rules of conjunction and implication, one notes that 
the premisses (the formulas immediately above the inference line) are
subformulas of the conclusion in the <i>I</i>-rules, whereas it is the other
way around in the <i>E</i>-rules. Gentzen noticed that in normal 
derivations, this property of single steps is inherited by the whole 
derivation, in the sense that all formulas are subformulas of the 
conclusion. This result gave as a byproduct a decision method for 
 <a href="../logic-intuitionistic/index.html" target="other">intuitionistic propositional logic</a>.
 Another corollary was a syntactic proof of consistency: if a 
contradiction is provable, anything is provable, but an atomic 
formula, say, has no proof: if it has a proof, it has a normal proof,
but no <i>E</i>-rules apply to an atomic formula, and no <i>I</i>-rule concludes it
either.</p>

<p>

Gentzen's idea was to extend natural deduction to a system of 
arithmetic by the addition of a rule that corresponds to the 
principle of complete induction. Consistency would then follow from 
the normalization of derivations and the subformula property. By 
early 1933, Gentzen realized that this proof strategy would not go 
through: the induction rule is schematic and has an infinity of 
instances, with no bound on the complexity of the induction formulas.
It would be impossible to restrict these formulas in advance, thus no
subformula property can hold. After this failure, Gentzen took 
verbatim out of his early thesis manuscript the translation from 
classical to intuitionistic arithmetic and submitted it as a paper in
March 1933, but withdrew the paper after hearing of G&ouml;del's 
publication of the result.</p>

<p>

Gentzen wrote that he was unable to prove a normalization theorem for
a classical system of ND. He therefore invented another logical 
calculus that he called sequent calculus (<i>Sequenzenkalkul</i>, 
literally &ldquo;calculus of sequences&rdquo;) and made it the 
central topic of his thesis. The name of the calculus comes from the 
representation of assumptions of a derivation as a list. The word 
&ldquo;sequent&rdquo; used as a noun is a suggestion of Kleene's in 
his <i>Introduction to Metamathematics</i> (1952: 441), taken up 
in many languages in the form of purely invented words.</p>

<p> Sequent calculus, SC for short, can be seen as a formal
representation of the derivability relation in natural deduction. A
sequent consists of a list &Gamma; of formulas, an arrow (in Gentzen,
later also other markers have been used), and one formula as a
conclusion. The list gives the assumptions the conclusion depends on
in a derivation, in a local notation where in ND they are found in the
leaves of a derivation tree. Gentzen also generalized sequents so that
they have, instead of one conclusion, a list of possible cases after
the arrow. This novelty led to the first satisfactory formulation of a
proof system for classical logic. Gentzen's SC rules for conjunction
and implication are, with commas separating elements in lists:</p>

<p>

This is not the place to explain the details of ND and SC (but see the
entry on <a href="../reasoning-automated/index.html" target="other">automated
reasoning</a>).  Gentzen formulated the latter, denoted LK, so that it
gave an intuitionistic calculus, denoted LJ, as a special case, the
one in which the conclusion is a list of at most one case. He then
proved the analogue of the normalization theorem for the classical
calculus, the calculus and the proof carefully formulated so that the
result for the intuitionistic calculus was a special case of the one
for the classical calculus. In LJ and LK, L stands for
&ldquo;logistic&rdquo;, a term by which Gentzen refers to the
axiomatic calculi of logic of Frege, Russell, and Hilbert and
Bernays. In such calculi, each line in a derivation is correct in
itself, i.e., a logical truth, whence the term. The letters K and J
come from the German words <em>klassisch</em> and
<em>intuitionistisch</em>. (The latter should thus be upper case "I",
but older German uses upper case "J" for upper case "I".)</p>

<p>

Gentzen called the analogue of normalization by the unimaginative 
name of <i>Hauptsatz</i>, &ldquo;main theorem&rdquo;. The standard 
terminology today is &ldquo;cut elimination theorem&rdquo; All of the
logical rules of SC have the subformula property in a very immediate 
sense: each formula in a premiss is a formula or subformula in the 
conclusion. The rule for combining derivations, analogous to the one 
explained above for the case of detour conversions in ND, is called 
&ldquo;cut&rdquo;. In it, a formula <em>A</em> appears as a case in a
first premiss and as an assumption in a second premiss. In the 
conclusion, this formula has disappeared and the assumptions of the 
two premisses collected together:</p>

<blockquote>
<table style="border-collapse:collapse;">
<tr><td style="padding:0px;border-bottom:1px solid black; text-align:center;">
 &Gamma; <strong>&rarr;</strong> <em>A</em> &nbsp; <em>A</em>, &Delta; <strong>&rarr;</strong> <em>C</em>
</td><td rowspan="2">
 &nbsp;Cut
</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center;">
 &Gamma;, &Delta; <strong>&rarr;</strong> <em>C</em>
</td></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Thus, cut is the only rule that makes a formula 
&ldquo;disappear&rdquo; in a derivation. Gentzen showed that 
instances of the rule of cut can be eliminated from derivations by 
permuting them upward until they reach points at which the derivation
starts. In ND, the starting points are assumptions, in SC they are 
&ldquo;initial sequents&rdquo; of the form 
<span class="nw"><em>A</em> &rarr; <em>A</em></span> in which the assumption 
formula <em>A</em> is at the same time the conclusion. A cut with 
such a sequent as one premiss has the other premiss equal to the 
conclusion and can therefore be deleted.</p>

<p>

After the proof of cut elimination, Gentzen had no use for the proof 
of normalization for intuitionistic natural deduction. He gave the 
first handwritten version of his thesis, with the detailed proof of 
normalization (equivalent to some 13 printed pages) to Bernays, but 
the latter seems never to have realized what he had in his hands. The
proof, among the papers of Bernays in Zurich, was discovered by the 
present author in February 2005 and is now available in an English 
translation (Gentzen 1933 [2008]). </p>

<h2><a id="ConAriAna">5. The consistency of arithmetic and analysis</a></h2>

<p>

After his thesis work on ND and SC for pure logic, Gentzen continued
his plan of proving the consistency of arithmetic. The result was
ready by December 1934. What this very first proof was, is not known
in detail. However, a letter to Bernays from 1938 indicates that the
proof that Gentzen wrote down by the summer of 1935 was not this
original one, but a second proof (see Menzler-Trott 2001, 79). This
second proof was criticized by Bernays and G&ouml;del who discussed it
during their Atlantic voyage to Princeton in September 1935. Gentzen's
idea in the proof was as follows: first, take the
conjunction-negation-universal quantification fragment of natural
deduction as the logic used in the formalization of arithmetic. Then
write each rule instance so that the premisses and conclusion have the
open assumptions listed at left, with an arrow separating the
conclusion, so, as sequents. This variant of ND is now called ND in SC
style. Consider a sequent
<span class="nw">&Gamma; <strong>&rarr;</strong> <em>C</em>.</span> If its 
conclusion is an atomic formula, it is an equation between numbers. 
In the worst case it is false, so then consider the list of 
assumptions. If one assumption is a conjunction, replace it by a 
conjunct of your choice, if a universal quantification, by an 
instance. If it is a negation &not;<em>A</em>, replace the conclusion
by <em>A</em>. If at any stage of this &ldquo;reduction 
process&rdquo; the conclusion of a sequent is a compound formula, you
have to consider any conjunct or any instance of universal 
quantification as a possible conclusion. In case of negation 
&not;<em>A</em> as a conclusion, move <em>A</em> to the assumption 
part and replace the conclusion by <span class="nw">0 = 1.</span> 
Gentzen shows that by 
proceeding in this way under the assumption that the sequent in 
question is derivable, either a true equation is found as a 
conclusion, or a false equation as an assumption. Thus, there are no 
derivable sequents with all assumptions true and the conclusion 
false.</p>

<p>

It was unclear to G&ouml;del and Bernays what the proof assumed; they
thought it assumed what is known in intuitionistic mathematics as the
fan theorem, but this was false. Termination of Gentzen's reduction
procedure can be proved instead by induction on well-founded trees
(&ldquo;bar-induction&rdquo;), a principle that was used by Gentzen on
intuitive grounds. Anyway, the result of the criticism was that
Gentzen changed without further ado the proof into a third proof that
uses the now famous principle of transfinite induction up to the first
epsilon-number. This induction was presented through a coding that
used decimal numbers. The concrete result of the changes for Gentzen's
paper published in 1936 was not good, however: the logical calculus
was changed midway in an article of seventy-odd pages that became very
difficult to read. Therefore Gentzen gave yet another, by the present
count fourth proof of the consistency of arithmetic in 1938 (at the
Bernays archives of the ETH Zurich), this time based on the classical
sequent calculus LK of 1933.  As mentioned, correspondence with
Bernays indicates that he thereby returned to the proof method that
had led to success in 1934. The use of transfinite induction is made
clearly visible in the 1938 paper through an ordinal notation. Such
induction principles on Cantor's &ldquo;second number class&rdquo; are
discussed in detail in Hilbert's 1925 lecture &ldquo;<em>&Uuml;ber das
Unendliche</em>&rdquo; (&ldquo;On the infinite&rdquo;, published
1926), a paper to which Gentzen referred.</p>

<p>

One would have thought that that was that, but Gentzen had reason to 
produce even a fourth proof of the consistency of arithmetic, in his 
last paper published in 1943 but written before the war in 1939. He 
extended Peano arithmetic through transfinite ordinals and made the 
transfinite induction principle part of this extended calculus. Then 
he showed directly that transfinite induction up to the first 
epsilon-number &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> is expressible but not provable 
in the system. G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorem is thus proved in 
a completely different way. The idea of the proof is, in brief terms,
as follows: first it is laid down what it means to derive transfinite
induction to a specific ordinal number in the system. Secondly, 
ordinal numbers below &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> are associated to 
derivations. These are called &ldquo;values&rdquo;. It is then shown 
that if transfinite induction to an ordinal number is derivable, this
ordinal number cannot be greater than the value of the derivation. 
Therefore transfinite induction to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> is not 
derivable.</p>

<p>

Since the induction principle can be expressed but not proved in 
ordinary arithmetic, a formula unprovable in Peano arithmetic is 
found. An easy consequence of Gentzen's version of the incompleteness
theorem is the consistency of Peano arithmetic, because anything 
would be provable in an inconsistent system. Contrary to G&ouml;del's
&ldquo;artificial&rdquo; unprovable formula that was obtained through
a coding of the arithmetized provability predicate, Gentzen's 
transfinite induction principle is a principle of 
&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; mathematics.</p>

<p>

Gentzen's last proof determined the &ldquo;proof-theoretic 
ordinal&rdquo; of Peano arithmetic, namely the one that is needed to 
prove consistency, with the property that nothing less would suffice.
The work marked the beginning of ordinal proof theory. It was without
doubt the most remarkable foundational achievement in arithmetic 
after G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorems, but is still largely 
unknown&mdash;one can find many books about G&ouml;del's theorems 
that do not even mention Gentzen.</p>

<p>

G&ouml;del had, it seems, not thought of giving a consistency proof 
of arithmetic through the use of non-finitary but still constructive 
principles. In the late thirties, at least from 1938 on, he developed
as a response to Gentzen's proof his own special interpretation of 
intuitionistic logic and arithmetic, what came to be known as the 
Dialectica interpretation. It uses computable functionals to 
interpret the proofs of intuitionistic arithmetic. G&ouml;del 
published the interpretation only in 1958, even though he had 
presented it in lectures in 1941. It is unknown if he discussed the 
matter when he met Gentzen in December 1939.</p>

<p>

At the request of Bernays, Ackermann reproduced Gentzen's proof in 
terms of Hilbert's 
 <a href="../epsilon-calculus/index.html" target="other">epsilon-calculus</a>
 in 1940. Ackermann's paper was the starting point of Kreisel's 1951 
&ldquo;no-counterexample&rdquo; interpretation of arithmetic. It was 
a surprise when the publication of G&ouml;del's collected papers 
brought to light his &ldquo;Zilsel-lecture&rdquo; in Vienna in 1938: 
he outlines there this interpretation as a reformulation of Gentzen's
1935 proof. (The matter is discussed in great detail in Tait (2005) 
who himself had worked on the no-counterexample interpretation and 
its extension to analysis in the 1960s.)</p>

<p>

The next obvious task in proof theory, after the proof of the 
consistency of arithmetic, was to prove the consistency of analysis, 
i.e., of the theory of real numbers. Gentzen did some work in this 
direction, but was then assigned to military service in the fall of 
1939. (He observed and reported the type, number, and direction of 
aircraft that flew above the town of Brunswick, until he was hit by a
nervous breakdown in early 1942.) From 1943 on he resumed the work on
analysis, but the difficulties intrinsic to the topic were great, as 
were the practical difficulties of life caused by the war. Analysis 
was to be formulated as a system of second-order arithmetic, which 
means that quantification is extended over number-theoretic 
predicates or, equivalently, over sets of natural numbers. 
Second-order number theory is used in Gentzen's last paper, published
in 1943, in which it is briefly shown that the principle of 
transfinite induction up to &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> is derivable in 
second-order number theory. </p>
 
<p>

More than half a century has passed with no constructive proof of the
consistency of full second-order arithmetic in sight. Early pioneers 
in this field included Kurt Sch&uuml;tte and Gaisi Takeuti. The 
former created in 1951 an infinitary sequent calculus to present 
consistency proofs in a perspicuous way, the latter instead used a 
more traditional Gentzen-style calculus (see Takeuti 1987).</p>

<p>

In the current research in the proof theory of second-order 
arithmetic, one studies what are known as subsystems of second-order 
arithmetic. The strongest results as of today are, in a very brief 
outline, the following: let <em>X</em> range over number-theoretic 
predicates. A formula such as <em>X(x)</em> states that <em>x</em> 
has the property expressed by <em>X</em>. We can now use first- and 
 <a href="../logic-higher-order/index.html" target="other">second-order logic</a>
 to form compound formulas such as 
<span class="nw">&forall;<em>X</em>(<em>X</em><em>x</em> &or; &not; 
<em>X</em><em>x</em>).</span> The collection of natural numbers for which 
such a formula with one universal second-order quantifier holds is 
called a 
<span class="nw">&Pi;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-set 
(in this case, the whole of
the natural numbers). More generally, a comprehension axiom is of the
form 
<span class="nw">&exist;<em>X</em>&forall;<em>x</em>(<em>X</em><em>x</em> 
&harr; <em>B</em>(<em>x</em>)).</span> If the formula <em>B</em> has no 
second-order quantifiers, the axiom gives what is called arithmetic 
comprehension or ACA. If <em>B</em> can have the form 
<span class="nw">&forall;<em>Y</em>&exist;<em>Z</em> <em>C</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> with no 
other second-order quantifiers, the special case of 
<span class="nw">&Pi;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>-comprehension 
is obtained. Consistency  proofs for a subsystem of second-order
 arithmetic with 
<span class="nw">&Pi;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>-comprehension 
have been given by Toshiyasu Arai and Michael Rathjen in the
mid-1990s.  (see Rathjen 1995 for these developments).</p>
 

<h2><a id="LatDevNatDed">6. Later developments in natural deduction</a></h2>

<p>

At the time when Gentzen worked out his system of natural deduction, 
Stanislaw Jaskowski was also developing a logical system for 
reasoning with assumptions. Formulas in derivations are arranged in a
linear succession, but Jaskowski's paper of 1934 remained fragmentary
and without substantial results such as a subformula property. The 
linear variant of natural deduction is followed in many pedagogical 
expositions of elementary logic (sometimes called &ldquo;Fitch 
systems&rdquo;). Gentzen found Jaskowski's work by June 1936, when 
both were in M&uuml;nster, and considered its linear arrangement of 
formulas an improvement, a &ldquo;liberation from the straitjacket of
the tree form&rdquo;, into one that reflects &ldquo;the linearity of 
thinking&rdquo; (the former from unpublished notes, the latter from 
Gentzen's thesis).</p>
 

<p>

The system of natural deduction lay mostly dormant for some thirty 
years, until the thesis of Dag Prawitz of 1965, <i>Natural Deduction:
A Proof-Theoretical Study</i>. The order in which Prawitz presented 
the normalization theorem was different from the one in Gentzen's 
early thesis manuscript. Prawitz gave first a normalization theorem 
and subformula property for a system of natural deduction for 
classical logic. This system contains no disjunction or existence. In
a second stage, he considered intuitionistic natural deduction for 
the full language of predicate logic and reduced its normalization to
the deletion of detour convertibilities as in the fragment of 
classical logic. When Gentzen's proof of normalization came to light 
in 2005, Prawitz said, in conversation with the present author, that 
it is clear that Gentzen knew the result, because the remarks in the 
printed thesis are so suggestive.</p>

<p>

In the late 1960s, <i>strong</i> normalization became an issue: 
Prawitz, using previous work of William Tait and Jean-Yves Girard, 
proved in 1971 that non-normalities in a derivation can be converted 
in any order, with a terminating normalization process and a unique 
normal derivation as a result. Gentzen seems not to have noticed the 
latter, but seems to have thought rather the contrary, by the failure
of this property for the elimination of cuts in sequent calculus.</p>
 
<p>

At about the same time as strong normalization was studied, the
<i>Curry-Howard</i> correspondence emerged. Curry had observed in his
work on combinatory logic in the late 1950s the analogy between
implication elimination in natural deduction and functional
application (Curry and Feys 1958). The idea was as old as
intuitionistic logic: by the &ldquo;BHK-explanation&rdquo; of the
connectives and quantifiers (for Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov), the
forms of propositions in intuitionistic logic express prescriptions on
how to prove those propositions: a
conjunction <span class="nw"><em>A</em> &amp;
<em>B</em></span> is proved by proving <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>
separately, a disjunction <span class="nw"><em>A</em> &or;
<em>B</em></span> by proving one of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, and an
implication <span class="nw"><em>A</em> &sup; <em>B</em></span> by
showing how to convert any proof of <em>A</em> into some proof of
<em>B</em>, and so on. These explanations come very close to the
introduction rules of natural deduction, but it remains unknown what
their effect on Gentzen's thought was.</p>

<p>

The Curry-Howard correspondence, from a paper by William Howard of 
1969, but published only in 1980, is based on the 
&ldquo;formulas-as-types&rdquo; principle, or in another jargon, on 
the &ldquo;propositions-as-sets&rdquo; principle. A proposition is 
thought of as its set of proofs. Truth of a proposition corresponds 
to the non-emptyness of the set. Proofs of 
<span class="nw"><em>A</em> &sup; <em>B</em></span> are now functions from (proofs 
of) <em>A</em> to (proofs of) <em>B</em> and 
<span class="nw"><em>A</em> &sup; <em>B</em></span> itself the set of such 
functions. Thus, if <em>f</em> : 
<span class="nw"><em>A</em> &sup; <em>B</em></span> and 
<span class="nw"><em>a</em> : <em>A</em>,</span> 
then functional application gives 
<span class="nw"><em>f</em>(<em>a</em>) : <em>B</em>.</span> The reverse, corresponding to the introduction of an 
implication, is captured by the principle of functional abstraction 
of Alonzo Church's &lambda;-calculus.</p>
 

<p>

The Curry-Howard correspondence has made intuitionistic natural 
deduction part of the computer science curriculum: it gives a 
computational semantics for intuitionistic logic in which 
computations, and the executions of programs more generally, are 
effected through normalization. A proof of an implication 
<span class="nw"><em>A</em> &sup; <em>B</em>,</span> say, is a program that 
converts data of type <em>A</em> into an output of type <em>B</em>. 
The construction of an object (proof, function, program) <em>f</em> 
of the type 
<span class="nw"><em>A</em> &sup; <em>B</em></span> ends with an 
abstraction. When an object <em>a</em> of type <em>A</em> is fed into
<em>f</em> as an argument, the resulting expression is not normal, 
but has a form that corresponds to an introduction followed by an 
elimination. Normalization now is the same as the execution of the 
program <em>f</em>. The use of intuitionistic logic is not tied to 
any intuitionistic philosophy of mathematics, but is just a 
systematic guarantee for the termination of the execution of computer
programs.</p>
 

<h2><a id="SeqCalLatDev">7. Sequent Calculus: later developments/applications</a></h2>
 
<p>

Gentzen's doctoral thesis marked the birth of structural proof 
theory, as contrasted to the old axiomatic proof theory of Hilbert. A
remarkable step ahead in the development of systems of sequent 
calculus was taken by Oiva Ketonen in his doctoral thesis of 1944. 
Ketonen, a student of mathematics and philosophy in Helsinki, went to
G&ouml;ttingen in 1938 to study proof theory with Gentzen&mdash;being the closest to a student the latter ever had. The connection 
seems to have been established by Ketonen's philosophy professor Eino
Kaila who had met Gentzen in 1936 in M&uuml;nster. Ketonen 
recollected later that Gentzen was &ldquo;a sympathetic young man of 
few words&rdquo; who gave him an introduction to the 
proof-theoretical systems and results. Ketonen's best-known discovery
is a sequent calculus for classical propositional logic the logical 
rules of which are all invertible, meaning that whenever a sequent is
of a form that matches the conclusion of a logical rule, the 
corresponding premisses, defined uniquely from the given sequent and 
the rule, are also derivable. The reverse is immediate (just apply 
the rule). Rules L&amp; and L&sup;, for example, are modified into</p>

<p>

There is just one left rule for conjunction (and dually just one 
right rule for disjunction). The left implication rule has what are 
called &ldquo;shared contexts&rdquo;: the assumptions and cases in 
the conclusion, except for the formula with the connective, are 
repeated identically in both premisses. Ketonen's idea was to define 
a system of proof search: one starts from a given sequent to be 
derived, chooses a formula in it, and writes the premisses of a rule 
that can conclude the given sequent. By invertibility, the question 
of derivability is replaced by one or two equivalent questions of 
derivability on simpler sequents. The new rules are needed to ensure 
uniquely defined premisses in such &ldquo;root-first&rdquo; 
decomposition.</p>

<p>

Ketonen's proof of invertibility of the logical rules of his sequent 
calculus used the structural rule of cut. Later Kurt Sch&uuml;tte 
(1950) and Haskell Curry (1963) gave direct proofs of invertibility, 
the latter with the explicit result that the inversions are <i>height
preserving</i>: if a given sequent is derivable in at most <em>n</em>
steps, the premisses in a rule that can conclude that sequent also 
have a derivation in at most <em>n</em> steps.</p>

<p>

How much of Ketonen's work stems from suggestions on the part of 
Gentzen remains unknown, because no correspondence has been found. 
Ketonen writes in the preface of his thesis that &ldquo;Dr. G. 
Gentzen of G&ouml;ttingen directed me towards the problem area of 
this work&rdquo;. The thesis was Ketonen's only original work in 
logic, saved from oblivion by a long review that Bernays wrote of it 
for <i>The Journal of Symbolic Logic</i> in 1945.</p>

<p>

One person who knew Ketonen's calculus in the late 1940s was Evert 
Beth. When Beth later, in 1955, presented his well-known tableau 
calculus, he seems to have forgotten the origin of the tableau 
calculus as a reformulation of the one of Ketonen, but refers instead
to Kleene's influential <i>Introduction to Metamathematics</i> of 
1952. Kleene had taken up Ketonen's calculus from the Bernays' review 
and also treated intuitionistic sequent calculus in which 
invertibility is more restricted than in the classical calculus. With
Kleene's book, Gentzen's sequent calculi became generally known and 
accessible.</p>

<p>

Kleene's work of the early 1950s also pioneered a remarkable 
development in sequent calculus, namely the 
&ldquo;contraction-free&rdquo; classical and intuitionistic calculi 
today denoted by <i>G3c</i> and <i>G3i</i>. These calculi have the 
property that none of Gentzen's original &ldquo;structural 
rules&rdquo; are needed. The rule of &ldquo;weakening&rdquo; permits 
the addition of superfluous cases and assumptions, and the rule of 
&ldquo;contraction&rdquo; the deletion of one copy of a formula if 
two were present in a list, as in</p>

<blockquote>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
	<strong>Weakening</strong>
      </td>
      <td></td>
      <td>
	<strong>Contraction</strong>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>

<table style="border-collapse:collapse;">
<tr><td style="padding:0px;border-bottom:1px solid black; text-align:center;">
 &Gamma; <strong>&rarr;</strong> &Delta;
</td><td rowspan="2">
 &nbsp;Wk
</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align:center;">
 <em>A</em>, &Gamma; <strong>&rarr;</strong> &Delta;
</td></tr>

      </td><td> &nbsp; &nbsp; </td><td>

<table style="border-collapse:collapse;">

<tr><td style="text-align:center;">
 <em>A</em>, &Gamma; <strong>&rarr;</strong> &Delta;
</td></tr>
</table>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<p>

Analogous rules permit weakening and contraction in the right, 
succedent parts of sequents. Weakening is made an eliminable rule by 
letting initial sequents have the form 
<span class="nw"><em>A</em>, &Gamma; <strong>&rarr;</strong> &Delta;,
<em>A</em></span>  instead of Gentzen's 
<span class="nw"><em>A</em> &rarr; <em>A</em>.</span> Contraction is likewise made 
eliminable by a suitable formulation of the rules. The import is that
in root-first proof search, no rules need be applied that would 
produce a duplication of a formula in a premiss. Without this result,
non-termination of proof search would not follow.</p>

<p>

The classical calculus has the property, mentioned above, of 
height-preserving invertibility of its logical rules. Albert Dragalin
refined in the late 1970s the calculus into one in which the 
structural rules are moreover &ldquo;height-preserving 
admissible&rdquo;, meaning that whenever the premiss of such a rule 
is derivable, the conclusion is derivable without the rule and with 
at most the same size (maximum number of rule instances in a 
derivation branch) of derivation. This property has profound effects 
on cut elimination: in permuting cut up, Gentzen had to restore the 
original contexts (the &Gamma;'s and &Delta;'s) through weakenings 
and contractions. With the height-preserving admissibility of these 
rules, the size of a derivation does not increase when the rules are 
applied. Dragalin gave also an intuitionistic multisuccedent calculus
with the same type of admissibility of the structural rules. 
Troelstra, finally, gave in the textbook <i>Basic Proof Theory</i> 
(2000, first ed. 1996) a single-succedent intuitionistic calculus 
with height-preserving admissibility of weakening and contraction. 
The contraction-free sequent calculi are powerful tools for the 
analysis of formal derivations. Many difficult research results in 
logic become just exercises through the control over the structure of
proofs that the <i>G3</i>-calculi permit.</p>
 
<p>

The earliest application of sequent calculus in mathematics was in 
the proof theory of arithmetic, in Gentzen's thesis and in a decisive
way in the 1938 proof of the consistency of arithmetic. Troelstra 
mentions Ketonen's work as </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
an early analysis of cutfree proofs
in Gentzen calculi with axioms; but he considers the form of cutfree 
derivations in the pure calculus where axioms are present in the 
antecedent of the sequents derived. (Troelstra and 
Schwichtenberg 2000: 142)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
 The axioms that Ketonen considers are 
those of projective and affine geometry, the former taken from 
Skolem's 1920 paper discussed in the first section above. Ketonen 
wanted to formulate Skolem's formal rules of proof within sequent 
calculus. However, Ketonen's work was mostly known only through its 
review by Bernays and only the logical part on sequent calculus was 
explained in detail there.</p>

<p>

A second way to apply the sequent calculus is to let sequents that
begin derivation branches have, in addition to initial sequents, also
the form <span class="nw"><strong>&rarr;</strong> <em>A</em>,</span>
in which <em>A</em> is an axiom, or an instance of a universal
axiom. Now, by Gentzen's &ldquo;extended Hauptsatz&rdquo;, cuts in
derivations can be permuted up until one of their premisses is an
axiom, but these cuts on axioms remain. Another, newer method is to
convert axioms into extra rules that are added to the logical rules of
sequent calculus, with full cut elimination maintained (as explained
in Negri and von Plato 2001, chapter 6, and in Troelstra and
Schwichtenberg's 2000, chapter 4.7).</p>

<h2><a id="AimProThe">8. The aims of proof theory</a></h2>
 
<p>

To what extent has proof theory achieved its original aims? For 
Hilbert, the aims were a complete clarification of the foundational 
problems through finitary proofs of consistency, etc, aims in which 
proof theory failed. Hilbert in his program was not interested in the
study of mathematical proofs in themselves, but only in clearing the 
central foundational problems (and then to forget about them). A 
recently found note by Hilbert gives a different picture: the note 
states that Hilbert wanted to add as a 24th and last problem in his 
famous Paris list of open mathematical problems of 1900 the 
development of &ldquo;a theory of proof methods in 
mathematics&rdquo;. This was before his metamathematical program for 
the development of a proof theory emerged.</p>

<p>

For Gentzen, the aims were, along with those of Hilbert, to 
understand the structure of mathematical proofs. This program was a 
complete success as far as pure logic and arithmetic are concerned. 
The methods of sequent calculus, especially, permit the analysis of 
proofs with profound results. The grand aim of proof theory, a proof 
of the consistency of analysis as in Hilbert's second Paris problem, 
has not been carried through but is not excluded, either.</p>

<p>

Some understanding of the notion of proof is necessary for any 
mathematician, if for nothing else, then at least for the 
communicability of mathematical results: publication rests on the 
understanding that proofs can be made as explicit as to be routinely 
checkable for correctness. However, proof theory has so far not 
become a practical tool for the working mathematician; the 
applications in mathematics have been rather isolated cases. Recent 
work on formalizing mathematical proofs with computerized systems, 
called <i>proof editors</i>, may gradually change this picture.</p>

<p>

Proof theory has created new aims outside traditional mathematics, 
especially in connection with computer science. Topics such as the 
verification of correctness of computer programs are an outgrowth of 
proof theory. Natural deduction has led to the Curry-Howard 
correspondence and to connections with functional programming, and 
sequent calculus is often used in systems of automatic proof search, 
as in logic programming.</p>

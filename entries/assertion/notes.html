 The article only concerns assertion with respect to its speech act
properties. The topic of the <em>content</em> of assertions is too
large to be covered here. A few other more general topics have also
been left out. However, an earlier version of this entry was organized
around the relations of assertion to other topics, including truth and
logic, and contained, e.g., discussions of conditional and
hypothetical assertions. The earlier version is available at

 For a discussion of Peirce&rsquo;s account of force, see Brock (1981)
and Bellucci (2019). Anticipations of a theory of force can also be
found in the phenomenological tradition. For a historical overview,
see B. Smith (1990). The development of systematic speech act theory,
in the 1950s, connected mainly back to Frege.</p>

 The recent literature on <em>silencing</em> explores the varieties of
ways in which the lack of appropriate uptake can be seen as
<em>silencing</em> the speaker. On this view, a speaker who is ignored
has failed to make an assertion or give an order. This can happen
because the would-be hearers don&rsquo;t pay attention, or because the
hearers misunderstand the speaker&rsquo;s intention, or even when the
hearers do understand the speaker but refuse to take them seriously.
For a central contribution, see Hornsby &amp; Langton 1998. For an
overview and a discussion of which theories of assertion can do
justice to the phenomenon, see Tanesini 2020.</p>

 An example is</p>

<blockquote>
France is hexagonal.
</blockquote>

<p>
The right thing to say, according to Austin, is that this statement
&ldquo;is just a rough description, it is not true or false&rdquo;
(1962: 143).</p>

<p>
After Lewis (1979) it is common to treat <em>standards of
precision</em> as a factor for determining truth or falsity relative
to a context, rather than as separate dimension of evaluation.</p>

 In Bach and Harnish&rsquo;s scheme, there are four top categories:
<em>constatives</em>, <em>directives</em> (including questions and
prohibitives), <em>commissives</em> (promises, offers) and
<em>acknowledgments</em> (apologies, condolences, congratulations)
(1979: 41). The category of constatives includes the subtypes, in Bach
and Harnish&rsquo;s terms, of <em>assertives</em>,
<em>predictives</em>, <em>retrodictives</em>, <em>descriptives</em>,
<em>ascriptives</em>, <em>informatives</em>, <em>confirmatives</em>,
<em>concessives</em>, <em>retractives</em>, <em>assentives</em>,
<em>dissentives</em>, <em>disputatives</em>, <em>responsives</em>,
<em>suggestives</em> and <em>suppositives</em> (1979: 41).</p>

<p>
In this list, predictives are distinguished by concerning the future
and retrodictives by concerning the past, dissentives by the fact that
the speaker is disagreeing with what was earlier said by the hearer,
and so on. Assertives, according to this taxonomy, are not
distinguished from other constatives by any such feature. As Bach and
Harnish point out (1979: 46), most of the specialized types of
constatives satisfy the definition of assertives (see
 <a href="index-2.html#CommInte">section 4.2</a>).
 This type then stands out as a higher category, including most but
not all of the constatives; not for instance suggestives (suggestions,
conjectures) and suppositives (assumptions, stipulations).</p>

<p>
A leading idea in the taxonomies of Searle (1975a) and Recanati (1987)
is to distinguish between types according to <em>direction of
fit</em>. Constative utterances have a word-world direction of fit
(what is said is supposed to conform to what the world is like), while
performative utterances have world-word direction of fit (the world is
supposed to be changed to fit what is said). Again, assertion is the
paradigmatic constative type, if not the constative type itself. For
overview and discussion, see Sbis&agrave; 2020.</p>
</div>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 In either case, presupposing should be kept distinct from asserting.
One further reason is that the presupposition occurs in other
illocutionary types as well. For instance, in asking</p>

<blockquote>
Did John [didn&rsquo;t John] manage to stop in time?</blockquote>

<p>
the speaker normally assumes that John tried and is only asking about
the success. Still, it is not easy to distinguish assertion from
presupposition in pure speech act terms. Typically, the distinction is
based either on the meaning properties of the sentence used, or on
properties of the conversational setting, that is, on what is taken
for granted (cf.
 <a href="index-2.html#ModeComm">section 3.2</a>,
 regarding Stalnaker&rsquo;s account).</p>

<p>
For instance, by</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="pool">(i)</dt>
<dd>We regret that the pool will be closed today.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
a concierge may inform a group checking in to a hotel about the state
of the pool. Formally, in
 <a href="#pool">(i)</a>
 it is presupposed rather than asserted that the pool will be closed,
but the information is conveyed equally well by means of the
presupposition as by means of a more direct assertion with</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="pooll">(ii)</dt>
<dd>The pool will be closed today.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
given that the guests did not already <em>know</em> that the pool
would be closed, and given that the guests were able to
<em>compute</em> the presupposition (both taken for granted by the
concierge). By contrast, assuming that the concierge believes that a
guest <em>does</em> know that the pool will be closed,
 <a href="#pool">(i)</a>
 will not be used to convey information about the pool, only about the
attitude of the staff, while a sincere utterance of
 <a href="#pooll">(ii)</a>
 is an assertion that the pool will be closed, whatever is assumed
about the hearer&rsquo;s prior knowledge. The contrast between
 <a href="#pool">(i)</a>
 and
 <a href="#pooll">(ii)</a>
 highlights a common intuition about a central feature of assertion:
explicitness. See
 <a href="index-2.html#Expl">section 2.4</a>.</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 The picture is more complex because of the distinction between
particularized and generalized conversational implicatures. One of
Grice&rsquo;s own examples of the latter is,</p>

<blockquote>
<em>X</em> is meeting a woman this evening. (1975: 37)</blockquote>

<p>
carrying the generalized implicature that the woman is not
&ldquo;<em>X</em>&rsquo;s wife, mother, sister or perhaps even close
platonic friend&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
In some later developments of the theory of generalized conversational
implicatures, especially in Levinson (2000), some generalized
implicatures are not really indirectly conveyed, but contribute to
what is <em>said</em>, for instance (directly) asserted. Thereby it
competes with <em>Relevance Theory</em> (Sperber &amp; Wilson 1986
[1995]), the theory of <em>implicitures</em> (Bach 1994), and the
theory of <em>modulations</em> (Recanati 2004), especially as regards
so-called <em>enrichments</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Irony does, however, qualify as indirect assertion on the definition
given by Recanati (1987: 125). According to Recanati, an indirect
speech act is a special kind of conversational implicature, where the
speaker not only implicates some proposition <em>p</em>, but also
<em>intends</em> to convey that <em>p</em>. In the case of
 <a href="index-2.html#switzer">(16)</a>,
 there is an apparent flagrant violation of the Quality principle to
say only what is true. On the assumption that the speaker is
cooperative, together with background knowledge of her political
awareness, the hearer can infer that she does not mean what she
literally says, but rather the opposite, that is, that what she
<em>wants</em> to communicate is the negation of what she says. For
Recanati, the communicative intention is what brings this act under
the category of assertion proper (see
 <a href="index-2.html#CommInte">section 4.2</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Although Searle&rsquo;s definition of indirect speech acts is
different, Searle too thinks that indirect speech acts work by means
of an inferential mechanism, including that of conventional
implicature. The hearer is supposed to understand that the speaker
cannot merely be performing the primary act, since that would violate
conversational principles, and then again conclude by conversational
reasoning which other act has been performed.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Pagin (2004: 851) suggested a so-called <em>inferential integration
test</em>, in which a sentence proposed as being used for indirectly
asserting that <em>p</em> (e.g., by irony) replaces the corresponding
explicit sentence in an inference. The idea is that if the intuitive
validity of the inference is preserved, the proposed sentence can be
accepted as being used for an indirect assertion.</p>

 Fricker is most directly concerned with what she calls
&ldquo;tellings&rdquo; (2012: 62), assertions used to provide
testimony, aimed at letting the hearer know what the speaker already
knows. According to Fricker, such speech acts are</p>

<ol>

<li>subject to the <em>knowledge norm</em> (the content must be known
by the speaker to be true, cf.
 <a href="index-2.html#NormAsse">section 5.1</a>)</li>
 
<li>acts in which the speaker undertakes <em>responsibility</em> to
the hearer for the truth of the content (cf.
 <a href="index-2.html#Comm">section 6.1</a>)</li>
 
<li>acts in which the speaker <em>represents</em> herself as knowing
that the content is true (cf.
 <a href="index-2.html#SelfRepr">section 4.1</a>).</li>
 </ol>

<p>
On Fricker&rsquo;s view, (1-3) is what gives tellings their
&ldquo;epistemic force&rdquo;. This is what motivates the hearer to
<em>believe</em> that what the speaker says is true. And, according to
Fricker, only utterances that are linguistically explicit can have
these properties: only such utterances are subject to the knowledge
norm, and only by means of such utterance can the speaker assume the
required responsibility. Successful hinting or indirect conveying do
not qualify. What Fricker calls <em>One-off Gricean communication</em>
does not qualify. These are cases when the speaker manages to get a
message across by means of &ldquo;an utterance that lacks any
conventional symbolic features to constrain the intended
message&rdquo; (2012: 71).</p>

<p>
Fricker&rsquo;s main reason is that when the content is not fixed by
linguistic conventions (together with salient contextual factors), the
speaker is free to <em>deny</em> having asserted, or stated, the
content she conveyed. That the content is fixed by linguistic
convention and context, and hence recoverable by the hearer, is what
incurs responsibility and makes the knowledge norm apply (2012:
76).</p>

<p>
However, very many linguistic &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; assertions retain
implicit features and ambiguities. There are lexical and syntactic
ambiguities, implicit quantifier domain restrictions, and many other
sources of underdetermination of utterance content by syntax and
(standing/conventional) meaning. Because of this, the hearer is often
not in a position to <em>know</em> what the content is, even when she
is able to make a correct educated guess (Hawthorne 2012, cf. Rysiew
2007, Peet 2015). The message is then not strictly speaking
recoverable by the hearer. By Fricker&rsquo;s standards, assertoric
quality of the utterance would be lost. The demands therefore seem too
high.</p>

<p>
Manuel Garc&iacute;a-Carpintero (2016, cf. 2019b) takes the
diametrically opposite view to Fricker&rsquo;s. He follows authors
like Hawthorne, Rysiew and Peet in stressing normal underdetermination
of content by standing meaning and context. He also criticizes
Fricker&rsquo;s appeal to deniability. Taken empirically, it does not
distinguish between explicit tellings and indirect communication;
oftentimes, speakers shamelessly deny what they have obviously
asserted (2016: 40). Taken normatively, it doesn&rsquo;t either, for
denying indirectly conveyed messages can be equally incorrect (2016:
41). Garc&iacute;a-Carpintero concludes that given Fricker&rsquo;s
conditions, &ldquo;almost nothing is an assertion&rdquo; (2016: 42).
Garc&iacute;a-Carpintero rejects Fricker&rsquo;s conditions
altogether, to the point of insisting that just about any type of
indirect, Gricean communication <em>can</em> count as a
<em>telling</em> in Fricker&rsquo;s sense, if it is successful, and he
illustrates this with an incredible story from Borges (2016: 37).</p>

<p>
Unlike Garc&iacute;a-Carpintero, Borg (2019) believes that &ldquo;the
extent to which a speaker is held responsible for a linguistically
conveyed content&rdquo; (2019: 20) varies depending on how explicitly
she conveys that content. Borg introduces a distinction between
<em>strict</em> linguistic liability (which tracks &ldquo;minimal
content&rdquo;, as defined in Borg (2012), and <em>conversational</em>
linguistic liability (which tracks &ldquo;explicature content&rdquo;,
as defined in Sperber &amp; Wilson (1995: 182). Her view maintains a
strict distinction between assertion and implicatures (i.e.,
implicatures can never be asserted), but allows that speakers can
assert both minimal and explicature contents, depending &ldquo;on the
kind of linguistic exchange taking place&rdquo; (Borg 2019: 20). The
hypothesis that attributions of liability and responsibility may track
distinctions between asserted content and (different varieties of)
implicit content has since been subject to experimental investigation
(Mazzarella, Reinecke, Noveck, &amp; Mercier 2018; Bonalumi,
Scott-Phillips, Tacha, &amp; Heintz 2020). For a systematic discussion
of these issues in relation to assertoric commitment and deniability,
see Peet (2015, forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Is there a basic conflict between assertion and the underdetermination
of content? There is a strong intuition that in an assertion, the
speaker <em>relies</em> on being understood. And in case the hearer
reacts by believing what she takes to have been said, she
<em>assumes</em> she has understood. Too much uncertainty about
communicative success alters the nature of the exchange. The parties
to the current debate appear to agree on that point. What is at stake
is primarily whether linguistic explicitness is sufficient for
achieving <em>justified</em> certainty, and whether it is necessary.
Secondarily, there is also a question what explains the phenomenon. Is
it because of responsibility, or because of something else? Proponents
of different accounts of assertion will answer this question
differently.</p>

 Marsili (2018: 644) takes assertion&rsquo;s truth-aim to establish a
<em>success condition</em> for the action performed by the speaker. An
assertion is (<em>prima facie</em>) successful if it is true, in the
same way in which shooting a penalty in football is (<em>prima
facie</em>) successful if one scores a goal. The idea here is that
truth is the <em>purported</em> goal of asserting a proposition: you
make an assertion only if you <em>purport</em> to try to say something
true. This echoes Dummett&rsquo;s point that:</p>

<blockquote>
A man makes an assertion if he says something in such a manner as
deliberately to convey the impression of saying it with the overriding
intention of saying something true. (Dummett 1973 [1981: 356])
</blockquote>

<p>
The claim made by these authors is not that asserting requires that
you actually <em>try</em> to tell the truth: on this picture, actually
trying to tell the truth is only required for <em>cooperative</em>
assertion. Note, further, that this characterization of assertion
cannot be defended as a definition, but at most as a necessary
condition, since there are other assertives (conjectures, hypotheses,
objections) that &ldquo;aim at truth&rdquo; in this sense.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Pointing to the difference between fact-stating and evaluative
discourse may help to distinguish assertions from evaluations, but
does not, again, help to distinguish assertion from other acts within
the fact-stating family, such as conjectures and assumptions. In fact,
unless we read a lot into &ldquo;stating&rdquo;, it is not enough even
to distinguish assertion from other acts that concern facts, such
expressing a <em>wish</em> that a fact obtains.</p>

<p>
In addition, recent years have seen a broadening of the use of the
terms &ldquo;truth&rdquo; and &ldquo;assertion&rdquo; that runs
counter to characterizing assertion by means of the fact-value
dichotomy. In various forms of <em>relativism</em>, expressions of
judgments of personal taste, such as</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="licor">(i)</dt>
<dd>Licorice is tasty.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
are characterized as assertions, and the semantic treatments use truth
as the basic sentence property. Common to varieties of relativism with
respect to predicates of personal taste is the idea that there is an
extra parameter of evaluation, a <em>standard of taste</em>, over and
above, say, possible world and time. Despite the lack of objectivity
in a more ordinary sense, such a semantics is typically coupled with
treating utterances of sentences such as
 <a href="#licor">(i)</a>
 as assertions (for discussion, see K&ouml;lbel 2004: 71; Lasersohn
2005; Egan 2012; MacFarlane 2014: ch. 7; Baghramian &amp; Carter
2020).</p>

<p>
There is, of course, a further question whether such a treatment is
appropriate.</p>

 As was already pointed out by Stalnaker (1974: 55), and later
stressed in Lewis (1979), an assertion that intuitively presupposes
the truth of another proposition need not fail, but can instead have
the effect of adjusting the common ground. In so-called
<em>accommodation</em>, the hearer adds the background assumptions
that would be required for interpretation. For instance, upon hearing
Lewis utter</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="lewiscat">(i)</dt>
<dd>The cat has gone upstairs.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
the hearer who didn&rsquo;t know may accommodate by adding the
assumption that there is a unique, contextually salient cat.
Accommodation is further discussed in Stalnaker (2002), where it is
stressed, among other things, that it works, when it works, because of
what is already presupposed. For example, in
 <a href="#lewiscatt">(i)</a>
 it is presupposed that the speaker knows whether or not he has a
cat.</p>

<p>
Whatever the truth about presupposition accommodation, Stalnaker
offers a model of the cognitive features of communication and the role
of assertion therein.</p>

 Schaffer proposes to add a topic-sensitive knowledge norm (cf.
 <a href="index-2.html#WhicNormAsse">section 5.1.4</a>)
 to the Stalnakerian picture. K&ouml;lbel focuses on commitments
instead.</p>

<p>
According to K&ouml;lbel, assumptions differ from assertion in two
respects. Firstly, they are temporary, which means that they can be
revoked when they have served their purpose. Secondly, they do not
have the same commitment properties. On K&ouml;lbel&rsquo;s view, an
assertion that <em>p</em> is made with the (Brandomian) undertaking of
the &ldquo;obligation to justify that <em>p</em> on request&rdquo;.
This undertaking, according to K&ouml;lbel, also distinguishes
assertion from presupposition, although in a more subtle way. It is
not, however, clear why in K&ouml;lbel&rsquo;s view, Stalnaker&rsquo;s
account would be needed in addition to the obligation property (for
another view that brings together Stalnaker&rsquo;s and
Brandom&rsquo;s accounts, see Antonsen (2018).</p>

<p>
Stokke chooses a different strategy: to differentiate between
assertions and other speech acts, like assumptions and conjectures, he
proposes to distinguish between &ldquo;official&rdquo; and
&ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; common grounds. Unofficial common grounds are
&ldquo;temporary&rdquo;: they open up in order to store information
that is used for the purpose of an argument or a reductio; by
contrast, official common grounds are, so to say,
&ldquo;permanent&rdquo;. Since assumptions and conjectures are only
added to the common ground temporarily, the only affect the
&ldquo;unofficial&rdquo; common ground. Assertion can then be defined
as a proposal to add a proposition to the official, permanent common
ground (for criticisms, see Fallis 2013, Van Riel 2019, Marsili
forthcoming-b).</p>

 An analogous move has been made as regards knowledge-varieties of
Moorean sentences, such as</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="knowrain">(i)</dt>
<dd>It is raining, but I don&rsquo;t know that it is raining.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Clearly, utterances of sentences like
 <a href="#knowrain">(i)</a>
 are bad, and some think that they are as bad as the paradigmatic
Moorean sentences like
 <a href="index-2.html#rain">(25)</a>.
 It is then argued that their badness shows that a speaker who asserts
that <em>p</em> also represents himself as knowing that <em>p</em>
(cf. Unger 1975: 256&ndash;260; Slote 1979: 179, and Williamson 2000:
253&ndash;255 with application to the knowledge norm).</p>

 Another variant of the communicative intention analysis is
Recanati&rsquo;s. Part of Recanati&rsquo;s solution to the sneaky
intention problem, following Grice (1969), consists in simply
demanding that sneaky intentions be absent. This is what it is for an
intention to be <em>open</em>, or <em>default-reflexive</em> (Recanati
1987: 191&ndash;207). He also follows Sperber and Wilson&rsquo;s idea
of making something <em>manifest</em>, i.e., perceptible or inferable
(1987: 120, 180; Sperber &amp; Wilson 1986: 38). Putting the various
ingredients together (including prototypicality conditions of
assertion&mdash;(Recanati 1987: 183), we get:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">
<dt id="recanat">(Re-A)</dt>
<dd>To assert that <em>p</em> is to make an utterance <em>u</em> by
which it is made manifest that the speaker has an open
(default-reflexive) intention that

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="recanata">a.</dt>
<dd><em>u</em> gives the audience reason to believe that the speaker
knows that <em>p</em> and wishes to share that knowledge with the
audience, and</dd>
<dt id="recanatb">b.</dt>
<dd>the audience recognize (a), and recognize it as open.</dd>
</dl> </dd>
</dl>

<p>
This is another complex analysis. The complexity of these accounts is
itself a problem, since it assumed that ordinary speakers are in the
habit of making assertions, and thereby to have the required
intentions for doing it. But since it requires detailed analytic work
to come up with the accounts, and there even are competing accounts,
it is unlikely that ordinary speakers have the intentions required. If
they do, they are clearly not aware of having them as agents usually
are aware of their intentions. Postulating such intentions in ordinary
speakers is clearly problematic.</p>

<p>
The difficulty is made more severe, because there are speakers with a
demonstrated inability to understand belief and other cognitive
attitudes. Some speakers with autism, who are clearly by everyday
standards using language for making assertions, fail so-called
false-belief tests. Thereby they reveal an inability to distinguish
between a proposition being believed and being true, and hence (since
they do distinguish between truth and falsity), reveal a lack of
understanding of what it is to believe something. If you cannot
understand what it is to believe something, you cannot intend someone
to believe something either (cf. Gl&uuml;er &amp; Pagin 2003). All in
all, the complexity and sophistication required of asserters by these
communication-intentions accounts, gives a reason to suspect that they
do not provide necessary conditions for making assertions.</p>

sufficiency condition. A good biconditional formulation of

 is as follows (cf. Lackey 2011: 252):</p>

 DeRose argued from the knowledge norm and the observation that in
different contexts more or less stringent standard for asserting
apply, to the conclusion that epistemic contextualism is true (2002b:
182). Epistemic contextualism is the view that &ldquo;know&rdquo; is
semantically context dependent. The truth value of a knowledge
attribution &ldquo;<em>X</em> knows that <em>p</em>&rdquo; depends on
standards of knowledge in the context of the knowledge attributor.</p>

<p>
DeRose&rsquo;s argument has been challenged by several authors. For
instance, Brown (2008, 2010) points out that the argument depends on
the biconditional version
 <a href="index-2.html#biperm">(A5*)</a>
 of the knowledge norm, and argues that the sufficiency part is less
well supported. Stanley also criticizes DeRose, despite accepting that
the standards of proper assertion vary between contexts. According to
Stanley, the reason this does not lead to contextualism about
knowledge is that assertion is governed by the certainty norm (2008:
55&ndash;56). According to Stanley, the varying standards of proper
assertion depend on the context dependence of &ldquo;certain&rdquo;,
not on any context dependence of &ldquo;know&rdquo; (which Stanley
rejects). According to Schaffer (2008), on the other hand, knowledge
itself is relative to a <em>question under discussion</em>, which is
reflected in his version of the knowledge norm (2008: 10).</p>

 Selecting the context of utterance itself as the context of
assessment relevant for assertion avoids an early critical point made
by Gareth Evans (&ldquo;Does tense logic rest on a mistake?&rdquo;,
1985: 349&ndash;350): if it is left open when to assess an assertion,
so that an assertion can be correct at one time and incorrect later,
the speaker aiming at correctness cannot decide what to say. If the
context of assessment is the context of utterance, then the speaker
does know. As a result, however, a traditional connection between
correctness and truth is given up. If the sentence is a future
contingent, the truth value determined at a later time has no bearing
on the correctness of the utterance (cf. Garc&iacute;a-Carpintero
2008; Greenough 2011; Marques 2014; and Caso 2014 for further
discussion of assertion in connection with relativism).</p>

 The term <em>commitment</em> denotes several subordinate concepts
along a descriptive-normative axis. At the descriptive end, we have
purely <em>psychological</em> commitments. A commitment, in this
descriptive sense, consists in mental states (intentions,
expectations, and preferences). At the normative end of the scale, an
agent can have commitments that are completely independent of their
own actions, intentions or preferences. An agent might be committed to
giving up smoking, whether they like to or not, simply because that is
the morally right thing to do. In between there is a spectrum of
possible notions combining descriptive and normative elements.
Standard commitment accounts tend not to be explicit about where on
the spectrum the account lies, but on natural interpretations, they
all have a normative ingredient. At the descriptive end of the scale,
if I in such a sense <em>commit</em> myself to stop smoking, my
commitment consists in a plan , i.e., a complex intention, to stop
smoking, a preference for realizing the intention over not realizing
it, and an expectation of, for instance, rebuke from my family if I
fail. In this sense, I can <em>cancel</em> my commitment at any time;
I just stop having the intention.</p>

<p>
At the normative end of the scale, I may count as committed to stop
smoking in virtue of, say, being a physician (who should set an
example of a healthy lifestyle), whatever I myself think about it.</p>

<p>
Between these two extremes, we find commitments that <em>result</em>
from freely chosen actions that the agent was not originally committed
to perform (like making a promise). But once the commitment is
<em>incurred</em> by the action, e.g., a public promise or declaration
to stop smoking, the agent is not free to cancel it. If I continue
smoking, then I have failed to live up to my commitment, and I could
not prevent this by first canceling the commitment. The commitment,
once incurred, has an independent normative status outside the control
of the agent.</p>

<p>
Commitment accounts of assertion tend to belong in the middle of this
scale. To make an assertion is a free action that incurs a commitment
that is not under the discretion of the speaker. The speaker cannot
cancel the commitment short of retracting the assertion. Because of
this feature, we shall treat commitment accounts as being mainly of a
normative type.</p>

 In his (2000), Alston reviews many accounts of taking responsibility
(in his terminology, &ldquo;R&rsquo;ing&rdquo;), identifying the
merits and weaknesses of each. The one we mentioned is apt to
characterize assertoric commitment, but Alston eventually endorses a
different view, according to which R&rsquo;ing can be characterized as
follows:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="rng">(R&rsquo;ing)</dt>
<dd>A speaker <em>S</em> <em>R</em>&rsquo;s that <em>p</em> in
uttering <em>U</em> iff in uttering <em>U</em>, <em>S</em> subjects
his utterance to a rule that, in this context, implies that it is
permissible for <em>S</em> to utter <em>U</em> only if <em>p</em>
(2006b: 60, edited).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Alston then (2000: 120) analyses assertion as a speech act by means of
which the speaker R&rsquo;s a proposition that they explicitly
expressed:</p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt id="als">(AS)</dt>
<dd><em>S</em> asserted that <em>p</em> in uttering <em>U</em> iff:

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt id="alsa">a.</dt>
<dd><em>S</em> R&rsquo;d that <em>p</em></dd>
<dt id="alsb">b.</dt>
<dd><em>S</em> explicitly presents the proposition that <em>p</em>, or
<em>S</em> is uttered as elliptical for a sentence that explicitly
presents the proposition that <em>p</em>.</dd>

 Which specific sanctions are linked to false assertions? The
sanctions to which assertors are subject cannot be easily codified:
asserting a proposition &ldquo;is to make oneself responsible for it,
<em>without any definite forfeit</em>&rdquo; (Peirce [CP]: 5.543).
Still, asserting falsehoods leads to a loss of credibility, which in
itself is a significant price to pay for speaking falsely: &ldquo;if
what is asserted is not true, the assertor forfeits in a measure his
reputation for veracity&rdquo; (Peirce [MS]: 5). Since communicators
care about their credibility, it also seems that these reputational
costs play an important role in limiting the spread of misinformation
within communication systems, human or otherwise (Green 2009, Graham
2020).</p>

 More specifically, Geurts characterizes commitment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
To say that <em>a</em> is committed to <em>b</em> to act on <em>p</em>
is to say that <em>a</em> is committed to <em>b</em> to act in a way
that is consistent with the truth of <em>p</em>. I take this to entail
that <em>b</em> is entitled by <em>a</em> to act on <em>p</em>, and
should <em>b</em> wish to act on <em>p</em>, and <em>p</em> turn out
false, then <em>b</em> may hold a responsible for the
consequences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The reader interested in how the notion of commitment relates to other
pragmatic notions such as common ground, implicature, and
communicative intentions can refer to Geurts 2019 and other
papers in a dedicated special issue of <em>Theoretical
Linguistics</em> (2019: 45(1&ndash;2)).</p>

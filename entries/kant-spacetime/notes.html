 In &sect;1 of the J&auml;sche Logic (Ak 9: 91), Kant writes:
&ldquo;All cognitions [<em>Erkenntnisse</em>], that is, all
representations consciously referred to an object, are either
<em>intuitions</em> or <em>concepts</em>. Intuition is a singular
representation (<em>repraesentatio singularis</em>), the concept is a
<em>general</em> (<em>repraesentatio per notas communes</em>) or
<em>reflected</em> representation (<em>repraesentatio
discursiva</em>).&rdquo; For an illuminating discussion of these
issues, see Thompson 1972, 323 and Allais 2007.</p>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 One of the clearest recent discussions of intuition, sensation and
the representation of space in the first <em>Critique</em> can be
found in Allais 2009. She argues that intuition provides us with
representations of particulars--of things with spatial
locations--independently of concepts, urging that we distinguish this
claim about <em>representation</em> from the famous Kantian thought
that we cannot achieve <em>cognition</em> without both intuitions and
concepts (Allais 2009, 390).</p>

 It does so because in Kant&rsquo;s terminology, &lt;desk&gt;
<em>contains</em> &lt;furniture&gt; which means, in turn, that
&lt;desk&gt; is a species of the genus, &lt;furniture&gt;. It is also
possible to read Kant as arguing that concepts represent objects
mediately not because of the higher-level genus of which they are a
species, but because of the lower-level species for which they serve
as a genus. I do not have the space to explore the details of that
reading here, but see A68&ndash;9/B93&ndash;4.</p>

 In recent years, there has been considerable scholarly interest in
the question of what is sometimes called "nonconceptual content"
following a prominent discussion in John
McDowell&rsquo;s <em>Mind and World</em>. Many scholars have then
applied this question to the first <em>Critique</em>, asking whether
Kant believed in such content. One might wonder in
particular: does Kant&rsquo;s analysis of intuition in the
Transcendental Aesthetic imply that we can have representational
content without the employment of concepts, or do his remarks in the
Transcendental Deduction about judgment and experience undermine that
view? Since these questions do not specifically concern Kant&rsquo;s
view of space and time, we cannot delve into the complexities involved
in answering them in this entry. However, there are many intriguing
treatments of the topic in the recent scholarly literature: see, e.g.,
Ginsborg 2008, Gr&uuml;ne 2017, and Tolley 2013.</p>

 Commentators sometimes think that Kant&rsquo;s use of
<em>Begriff</em> here presents a problem, since Kant himself tries to
show that the representation of space is not <em>begrifflich</em>
(conceptual) in character (see below). But <em>Begriff</em> also has
the general meaning of a notion or a representation, which seems to be
the usage here. The term has a technical meaning in the Kantian
vocabulary&mdash;one noted above&mdash;but the two should not be
conflated. For a helpful discussion of Kant&#39;s idea of an
&quot;exposition&quot; and its difference from a <em>definition</em>,
see Dunlop 2012, 94&ndash;94 and also Messina 2015, 422.</p>

 The full passage reads as follows (L 5: 47):</p>

<blockquote>
I will show here how men come to form the notion [la notion] of space.
They consider that many things exist at once and they observe in them
a certain order of co-existence, according to which the relation of
one thing to another is more or less simple. It&rsquo;s their
situation or distance. When it happens that one of those co-existent
things changes its relation to a multitude of others, which do not
change their relation among themselves; and that another new thing
acquires the same relation to the others, as the former had, this
change we call a motion in that body wherein is the immediate cause of
the change. And though many, or even all, the co-existent things
should change according to certain known rules of direction and
swiftness, yet one may always determine the relation of situation,
which every co-existent acquires with respect to every other
co-existent; and even that relation which any other co-existent would
have to this, or which this would have to any other, if it had not
changed, or if it had changed any other way. And supposing, or
feigning, that among those co-existents there is a sufficient number
of them which have undergone no change, then we may say, that those
which have such a relation to those fixed existents, as others had to
them before, now have the <em>same place</em> which those others had.
And that which comprehends all those places, is called <em>space.</em>
Which shows, that in order to have the idea of place, and consequently
of space, it suffices to consider these relations and the rules of
their changes, without needing to form an absolute reality
[r&eacute;alit&eacute; absolue] out of the things whose situation we
consider.

 One of Leibniz&rsquo;s points seems to be that his relationalism is
perfectly <em>compatible</em> with the contention that the
representation of space is empirical (for the view that some of the
arguments in the Metaphysical Exposition are intended to undermine
Leibnizian relationalism, see Guyer 1987, 349; Wojtowicz 1997, 79, 84,
87; Brandt 1997, 96&ndash;7; Walker 1978, 42&ndash;4; Parsons 1992,
68). He apparently employs this tactic to show that perceivers can
obtain a representation of space via the perception of spatial
relations among objects without recourse to the view that space is
ontologically independent of objects. This parallels Locke&rsquo;s
attempt to show that one can obtain an Idea of space while having
distinct ideas of space and of body. So the idea&mdash;popular among
Newton&rsquo;s supporters like Locke&mdash;that the representation of
space is empirical in origin is perfectly compatible with
relationalism. Indeed, Locke&rsquo;s view may very well have been on
Leibniz&rsquo;s mind when he argued for the compatibility of an
empiricist conception of the representation of space with his
relationalist conception of space&rsquo;s ontological status because
of his considerable interest in Locke&rsquo;s theory of ideas. This is
a clever tactic on Leibniz&rsquo;s part: when writing to
Newton&rsquo;s most prominent defender in England, Samuel Clarke, he
accepts an empiricist view of the representation of space in order to
show that this acceptance does nothing to upset his defense of the
relationalist conception of space&rsquo;s ontological status.</p>

 On this point, see especially Leibniz&rsquo;s letter to Arnauld of 30
April 1687 in Leibniz 1890, 2: 101. See also <em>New Essays</em>, 110
and L5: 32. For an illuminating discussion of reification, see

&ldquo;J&auml;sche Logic,&rdquo; &sect;&sect;7&ndash;9, Ak 9:
95&ndash;98 and Ak 9: 40. The most detailed and helpful discussion of
Kant&#39;s understanding of the difference between conceptual and
intuitive representation is Anderson 2015 (see, e.g., 65&ndash;68 for a
discussion of extension and intension). Anderson very helpfully
situates Kant&#39;s view within the crucial Wolffian background in
which Kant first began philosophizing in the 1740s and 1750s (see
2015, 81&ndash;88).</p>

 However, there is no consensus on this point. For instance, Messina
argues that in fact the Metaphysical Exposition provides an analysis
of the essence of space itself, rather than of the representation of
space (Messina 2015).</p>

 Of course, a Leibnizian would deny this point, and it is unclear that
Kant has any argument against an alternate view&mdash;this may
represent a bedrock disagreement. For discussion, see Friedman 1992,
62&ndash;8 and Posy 2000, 161&ndash;2.</p>

 Kant&rsquo;s contention that space is represented as an infinite
given magnitude has generated substantial scholarly discussion. For a
helpful analysis of recent scholarship on that question, see Patton
2011 and also Posy 2008. In a recent paper, Guyer argues that
according to Kant&rsquo;s considered view in the <em>Critique</em>, we
do not represent space as an infinite given magnitude because space is
not an object &ndash; and therefore not an infinite object &ndash; but
rather merely a form of intuition, so it actually has no determine
magnitude (Guyer 2018, 189, 191, 196). There is also the question of
how to understand the relation between the claim in the Aesthetic that
space and time are infinite given magnitudes and the discussion of
spaces and times in the Axioms of Intuition. For instance, in the
former Kant seems to suggest that there is a priority of the whole
over the parts for space and time, but in the latter, the suggestion
seems to be that since space and time are intuitions and all
intuitions are magnitudes, it follows that there is a priority of the
parts over the whole, as for all magnitudes. These puzzles, and many
related issues, are deftly handled in Daniel Sutherland&rsquo;s recent
book, where he distinguishes between Kant&rsquo;s analysis of space
and time <em>per se</em> and his analysis of particular spaces and
times (Sutherland 2022, 36&ndash;40). More generally, Sutherland
provides a detailed analysis of Kant&rsquo;s general view that
mathematics is the science of magnitudes.</p>

 On this point, see especially the &ldquo;Amphiboly of the Pure
Concepts of Reflection,&rdquo; which serves as an Appendix to the
Transcendental Analytic in the first
<em>Critique</em>&mdash;A260&ndash;92/B316&ndash;49.</p>

 These ideas are discussed and clarified in Adams 1994, 181&ndash;2,
246&ndash;7 and Langton 1998, 93&ndash;121. Langton in particular
attempts to provide a reading of Leibniz&rsquo;s
metaphysics&mdash;especially its treatment of relations and of space
and time&mdash;that helps to illuminate Kant&rsquo;s transcendental
idealism.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 Other passages corroborate the impression that this sentence leaves.
For instance, in the first passage in the Aesthetic in which Kant
claims that transcendental idealism is correct, he writes:
&ldquo;Space represents no property at all of any things in themselves
nor any relation of them to each other, i.e., no determination of them
that attaches to objects themselves and that remains even if one
abstracts from all subjective conditions of intuition&rdquo; (A26/B42;
cf. A39/B56). And in a later passage in the <em>Critique</em>, after
describing transcendental idealism, Kant adds (in a section of the
text quoted above): &ldquo;To this idealism is opposed a
<em>transcendental realism</em>, which regards time and space as
something given in themselves (independent of our sensibility)&rdquo;
(A369; the passage is retained in the second edition).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 In a recent paper, Jauernig (2008) presents a markedly different
interpretation in part in an attempt to indicate that
Kant&rsquo;s criticisms in the <em>Critique</em> are often intended to
undermine various <em>Leibnizian</em> positions that Leibniz himself
did not embrace. In the course of presenting this interpretive
perspective, Jauernig provides a very helpful reading of the so-called
Amphiboly, the text in which Kant discusses Leibnizian philosophical
views in the most depth.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 The contention that transcendental idealism and transcendental
realism differ in their conceptions of the relation between
<em>space</em> and <em>intuition</em>, rather than <em>space</em> and
<em>the mind</em>, is significant. For as we have seen, Leibniz does
not think that space is real in the sense of being independent of the
mind <em>per se</em>; space is a relational order and relations are
dependent on &ldquo;the understanding.&rdquo; Rather, on Kant&rsquo;s
reading, he thinks space is independent of intuition <em>per
se</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 Yet if Leibniz thinks that space is a relational order, that
relations are mind-dependent, and that our
&lt;space&gt;<sub>confused</sub> is dependent upon sense perception,
is he committed to the idea that space itself is somehow dependent
upon sense perception? If so, it is not clear that Kant&rsquo;s
characterization of him through the lens of transcendental realism is
fair. First, as Kant well knew, Leibniz contends in the <em>New
Essays</em> that relations are not merely mind-dependent, but in fact
dependent on the understanding, rather than on sense perception. This
may suggest that when we consider space through the lens of the
understanding&mdash;when we focus on our &lt;space&gt;<sub>clear &amp;
distinct</sub>&mdash;we find that space is a relational order that
depends upon the understanding because it depends upon relations,
which in turn are &ldquo;added&rdquo; by the understanding to the
objects that exist. Perhaps the suggestion here is that relations
themselves are not an aspect of our &lt;space&gt;<sub>confused</sub>
but in fact are an aspect of our &lt;space&gt;<sub>clear &amp;
distinct</sub>. One might think our confused representation of space
represents space as a kind of independent entity, and not as a
relational order, since for Leibniz, the ordinary conception is
mistaken in its portrayal of space as a kind of quasi-entity. Of
course, space is not actually a quasi-entity, and therefore the
correct view of the origin of our representation of space, outlined in
Leibniz&rsquo;s last letter to Clarke, should not present space in
that fashion. Instead, the correct view of the origin of our
representation of space ought to presuppose that space is merely a
relational order, and ought to be able to explain that origin while
making that presupposition, despite the fact that the representation
itself represents space <em>as something other than a relational
order</em>. When we focus on our &lt;space&gt;<sub>clear &amp;
distinct</sub>, we find that space is represented <em>as</em> a
relational order, and as we have seen, those relations are dependent
upon the understanding.</p>

 He makes a similar charge elsewhere in the Aesthetic:</p>

<blockquote>
For if one regards space and time as properties whose possibility must
be found in things in themselves [Sachen an sich], and considers the
absurdities in which one is then entangled, in that two infinite
things [Dinge], which are not substances nor something actually
inhering in substances, must yet exist, nay, must be the necessary
condition of the existence of all things, and also must remain even if
all existing things are removed,&ndash; one cannot blame the good
Berkeley if he degraded bodies to mere illusion [blo&szlig;em
Schein]&hellip; (B70&ndash;1; cf. <em>Inaugural Dissertation</em>, Ak
2: 403&ndash;4).

 Vorl&auml;nder reprints the review in his edition of the
<em>Prolegomena</em> (Kant 1920) at 167&ndash;74, along with letters
between Garve and Kant from 1783 at 175&ndash;88.</p>

 It is certainly possible to read this passage differently, and to
regard Berkeley as a transcendental realist in Kant&rsquo;s schema. If
transcendental realism is the view that we can obtain knowledge of
things in themselves, and if Berkeley can be understood as arguing
that we know things in themselves to be nothing but concatenations of
ideas&mdash;and the remaining things to be minds, and perhaps
God&mdash;then he can be understood as a transcendental realist.</p>

 This seems to be Kant&rsquo;s interpretation of Berkeley, despite
some obvious shortcomings. Kant seems to ignore the fact that for
Berkeley, the mind&mdash;and also God&mdash;are independent of
intuition, or of sense perception. In other words, Berkeley surely
takes God and minds to be real entities in the sense that they, unlike
everything else, are not mere congeries of ideas.</p>

 There is also some contemporary support for reading Leibniz as a kind
of idealist&mdash;see especially the interpretation in Adams 1994.</p>

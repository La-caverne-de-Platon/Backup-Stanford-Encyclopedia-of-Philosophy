<h2><a name="RelVie">Related Views</a></h2>

<p>
There are a number of philosophers and traditions that share the two
key features of Anomalous Monism: its rejection of any reductive
relationship between mental and physical events and properties, and
its assertion of monism. In this section, we look briefly at one
classic precursor to Anomalous Monism as well as several more recently
developed positions that share these features. The comparisons help to
shed further light on Anomalous Monism.</p>

<p>
At the most general level, one distinctive component of Anomalous
Monism is its <em>a priori</em> status. It is deduced logically from
what are plausibly claimed to be a relatively bland set of assumptions
themselves not clearly empirical in nature, and each, individually,
acceptable to dualist ontological positions. (Certainly the anomalism
principle is not empirical. While the cause-law principle has been
claimed to be an empirical, and false, assumption (Cartwright
1983&mdash;see 3.3), we have seen
 (<a href="index-2.html#JusCauLawPri">3.2</a>)
 that Davidson himself views it as <em>a priori</em>. The interaction
principle does not appear to be based upon empirical assumptions.)
This <em>a priori</em> status sets Anomalous Monism apart from other
forms of nonreductive monism that have been developed since Anomalous
Monism was formulated. However, Anomalous Monism&rsquo;s clearest
philosophical ancestor, Spinoza (1985 [1677]), shared this <em>a
priori</em> perspective, and Davidson explicitly acknowledges
Spinoza&rsquo;s anticipation of Anomalous Monism (Davidson 1999c). We
begin with him.</p>

<hr/>

<h3><a name="SpiPar">1. Spinoza&rsquo;s Parallelism</a></h3>

<p>
Spinoza held that the world was composed of only one kind of substance
or stuff (monism) which exhibits distinct realms of physical and
mental properties. On the standard reading of Spinoza&rsquo;s
metaphysics, these two realms are causally insulated from each
other&mdash;while mental events can cause and result from other mental
events, and physical events can cause and result from other physical
events, there are no causal relations between mental and physical
events. There are thus no strict psychophysical laws. But there are
both strict physical and strict psychological laws. The causal
insulation of the two realms, and the existence of strict
psychological laws, appear to distinguish Spinoza&rsquo;s position
from that of Anomalous Monism.</p>

<p>
Davidson, however, disputes this traditional reading of
Spinoza&rsquo;s metaphysics , emphasizing two key points. First, while
Spinoza does indeed deny that there can be explanatory relations
between the mental and the physical, his notion of explanation is
quite demanding. &lsquo;Explanation&rsquo; means &lsquo;adequate
explanation&rsquo;, which in turn requires a demonstration of logical
entailment between <em>explanans</em> and <em>explanandum</em>.
Davidson happily concedes that no such relation exists between mental
and physical properties and events. But he denies that one need impose
such a strong requirement on causation and causal explanation. In any
case, it is consistent with Spinoza&rsquo;s position that mental
events cause and are caused by physical events so long as one does not
equate &lsquo;cause&rsquo; with &lsquo;logically entails&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Second, and related to this, Davidson insists that while explanation
is, intuitively, an intensional notion&mdash;one sensitive to how
events are described&mdash;causation is extensional, obtaining between
pairs of events independently of how they are described. As we have
seen
 (<a href="index-2.html#ArgForAnoMon">1</a>,
 <a href="index-2.html#EpiObj">6&ndash;6.2</a>), this distinction between causation and explanation is
central to Anomalous Monism. Some interpreters of Spinoza, explicitly
considering the question of his relation to Anomalous Monism, have
denied that Spinoza would or should accept such an extensional account
of causation (see Della Rocca 1991 and Jarrett 1991). Davidson replies
that one needs to distinguish an opaque and a transparent concept of
&lsquo;cause&rsquo; (where the former involves sentences which do not
allow the substitution <em>salva veritate</em> of co-referring
expressions, and latter does allow such substitutions). Davidson
accepts that Spinoza himself probably had in mind the opaque concept,
in keeping with historical tradition, but that nothing stands in the
way of his accepting a needed transparent concept as well. Davidson
sees this as the only way to get Spinoza out of being saddled with the
logical absurdity that would result from holding that, for instance,
the physical event of a bell ringing cannot cause a mental awareness
of the ringing even though that mental awareness is identical (as
Spinoza&rsquo;s monism requires) with a physical event in the brain
caused by the ringing.</p>

<p>
According to Davidson, what Spinoza is really committed to is denying
the possibility of a fully adequate (complete) explanation of the
occurrence of the awareness by appeal to the laws of nature and the
cause described in physical terms. This does not preclude holding that
the ringing of the bell may cause us to be aware of the ringing.
Davidson goes on to reject Spinoza&rsquo;s infamous doctrine of
parallelism, the view that the temporal order of physical events
corresponds to the order and connection of ideas. Since the physical
domain is governed by strict laws, this would entail the possibility
(indeed, necessity) of strict, purely psychological laws. Just as
events described physically would have a fully adequate explanation in
terms of strict physical laws and initial conditions, so too would
events described mentally need to have a fully adequate explanation in
terms of strict mental laws and initial (mental) conditions. Davidson
rejects this picture (as indeed Anomalous Monism must) because too
many causes and effects of mental events are not themselves events
with mental descriptions&mdash;the mental domain is thus
&lsquo;open&rsquo; in a way that the physical domain is not
 (<a href="index-2.html#PsyAno">2.3</a>).
 Every physical event has a fully adequate (strict) physical
explanation, but no mental event can have a fully adequate (strict)
mental explanation.</p>

<p>
In these ways, then, Davidson finds points of significant contact
between Anomalous Monism and Spinoza&rsquo;s position, and attempts to
soften or correct those points of apparent divergence.
Davidson&rsquo;s view appears to be that if Spinoza had had available
to him the intensional-extensional distinction as well as a concept of
causation that was not identical to logical entailment, his position
would essentially be that of Anomalous Monism. However, related to
Spinoza&rsquo;s commitment to strict psychological laws is his
infamous insistence on determinism and subsequent lack of free will
and free action. Davidson claims, to the contrary, that Anomalous
Monism, with its denial of strict psychophysical and psychological
laws, is a key necessary condition of freedom (see 
 <a href="related-issues.html#AnomMoniFree">Related Issues: 3. Anomalous Monism and Freedom</a>).</p>

<h3><a name="Fun">2. Functionalism</a></h3>

<p>
Functionalist accounts of mental phenomena (for a good overview, see
Block 1980) were the most prominent of the nonreductionist monist
positions developed at around the same time as Anomalous Monism.
According to functionalism, an adequate analysis of the meaning and
individuation of propositional attitudes such as belief, desire,
intention and other psychological states is in terms of the
explanatory/causal role that they play in the etiology of behavior.
Beliefs differ from desires, for instance, in the role that each plays
in mediating the relations between perceptual inputs, behavioral
outputs and other intervening psychological states. To believe
something is just to be in a state that exhibits such a distinctive
causal pattern. It is not relevant what realizes such a functional
state, however, just so long as it is the sort of realizing media that
can support such a pattern.</p>

<p>
Associated with functionalism was the doctrine of multiple
realizability: mental properties can, in practice as well as
principle, be realized by a variety of media which do not share
anything in common physically other than a capacity to support the
distinctive pattern (Fodor 1974). Other species, with different
internal wiring, can realize mental properties, and in principle so
could extraterrestrial beings. Mental properties therefore cannot be
reduced to physical properties because of this heterogeneous nature of
the realizing physical media. However (at least according to most
proponents of functionalism&mdash;see Lewis 1966), <em>some</em>
physical media must play the realizing role&mdash;hence, monism.</p>

<p>
Functionalism therefore differs from Anomalous Monism in appealing to
multiple realizability rather than rationality as the ground for
irreducibility. There are other important differences as well. For one
thing, it is unclear what exactly grounds the monism of
functionalism&mdash;in Anomalous Monism, the monism is derived in an
<em>a priori</em> fashion from Davidson&rsquo;s three principles, but
it often seems to be simply an assumption within the functionalist
framework (Fodor 1974, but again, see Lewis 1966). Indeed, some
functionalists explicitly observe that their account is consistent
with dualism (see Block 1980). Another key difference is that
traditional functionalism has built into it a kind of reductionism,
though not of the type-type variety. This comes out in the fact that
the inputs and outputs between which the functional states are
supposed to play their mediating role are typically required to be
characterized in non-intentional terms. For instance, intending to
stay dry would be (partially) defined not in terms of perceiving that
it is raining and subsequently opening an umbrella, but instead in
terms of something like sensory stimulations and mere bodily
movements. Indeed, many functionalists claim to provide an
<em>analysis</em> of mental properties in other, non-mental terms.
Brian Loar (Loar 1981, 20&ndash;25) sees his functionalist account as
a direct refutation of Anomalous Monism, purporting to account for the
rational nature of mental states and events within a reductionist
framework (see
 <a href="index-2.html#ConArgMcDChi">4.2.3</a>).
 But whether or not all functionalists view their accounts in these
terms, it nonetheless appears that the nonreductionism of
functionalism is of a vertical but not horizontal nature, so to speak.
Mental properties cannot be reduced to their realizing physical
properties (because of multiple realizability), but there will be
strict lawlike generalizations (the distinctive patterns) that purport
to define mental properties in non-mental terms&mdash;causal relations
to non-mentally characterized inputs, outputs and other functional
states.</p>

<p>
Another point on which functionalism diverges from Anomalous Monism is
in its attempt to account not only for the propositional
attitudes&mdash;belief, desire, intention, etc.&mdash;but also for
sentient states and events like pains and tickles&mdash;conscious
phenomena that there is something it is like to experience (Nagel
1974). These wider aspirations have, however, proven to be especially
problematic for functionalism. A standard objection has been that
while the propositional attitudes may be given a plausible analysis in
terms of causal patterns, the felt quality of sentient states and
events cannot be analyzed in purely causal terms without losing touch
with what is distinctive about such phenomena (Nagel 1974; Chalmers
1996; see
 <a href="#OthPos">Section 4</a>
 below).</p>

<p>
Many of the same questions that arose in our examination of Anomalous
Monism&mdash;in particular, concerning supervenience and mental
causation&mdash;arise also in discussions of functionalism. Indeed,
these questions arise for any property dualist monism&mdash;any theory
on which mental and physical properties are thought of as distinct and
irreducible but instantiated by the same set of states, events or
substances. For instance, Kim 1992 argues that multiple realization
actually entails a form of type-reduction, given the key physicalist
assumption&mdash;the causal inheritance principle&mdash;that the
causal powers/explanatory relevance of higher order properties is
identical to and exhausted by those of all of their lower-order
realizing properties. On this view, mental properties have no causal
powers/explanatory value over and above those of their realizing
physical properties. Kim&rsquo;s formulation of the principle,
however, is completely insensitive to the points about effect-types
and interest-relativity of explanation discussed in
 <a href="index-2.html#IntRelDuaExpStr">6.2</a>
 and the supplement on
 <a href="mental-properties.html">Mental Properties and Causal Relevance</a>).
 A more nuanced formulation of the principle also amenable to
physicalists would respect those points by selecting, from the full
set of realizing causal powers, those that actually play an
explanatory role relative to particular effect-types. Such a
formulation of the principle would not clearly lead to the
reductionist conclusion pressed by Kim, yet would retain a physicalist
ontology and also respect the insights of the dual <em>explananda</em>
approach.</p>

<h3><a name="BarMat">3. Bare Materialism</a></h3>

<p>
Another version of nonreductive monism, put forward in different ways
by Hornsby (1981, 1985, 1993), Leder (1985) and McDowell (1985),
rejects the token-identity of Anomalous Monism and replaces it with a
blander, bare materialist doctrine of substance monism. As we have
already seen
 (<a href="index-2.html#ObjTokIde">5.2</a>),
 this is motivated, in the first instance, by the concern that it is
simply too demanding to require that every mental event bear a
uniquely identifying description in the language of physics&mdash;the
fine-grained spatiotemporal specificity of the language of physics
appears ill-suited to mental events. Davidson&rsquo;s early view,
recall, was that there must be such a fine-grained physical
description for every causally interacting mental event, though he
made no attempt to provide examples. McDowell (1985) sees this
requirement as an overreaction to the threat of Cartesian dualism. He
puts the point as follows: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip;since it is not events but substances that are composed of
stuff, one can refuse to accept that all the events there are can be
described in &lsquo;physical&rsquo; terms, without thereby committing
oneself to a non-&lsquo;physical&rsquo; stuff or compromising the
thesis that persons are composed of nothing but matter. (McDowell
1985, 397) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This view is essentially shared by Hornsby and Leder, each of whom
questions both the intelligibility of attaching precise spatiotemporal
parameters to mental events, and the purported necessity of doing so,
in order to maintain a materialist position. McDowell and Hornsby
subsequently come to question the cause-law principle, which, when
appended to the interaction and anomalism principles (both of which
are accepted by McDowell and Hornsby) leads to the token-identity
thesis they question. Each sees the cause-law principle as unmotivated
and, as we have seen, McDowell claims it to be inconsistent with
another of Davidson&rsquo;s basic commitments&mdash;his rejection of
scheme-content dualism (see
 <a href="index-2.html#ObjCauLawPri">3.3</a>
 and the supplement on
 <a href="related-issues.html">Related Issues</a>
 (Anomalous Monism and Scheme-Content Dualism)).</p>

<p>
We have already seen that Davidson later came to weaken his early
claim regarding uniquely identifying strict law descriptions for
mental events. So the rationale for bare materialism, as an
alternative to Anomalous Monism, seems less compelling. With respect
to bare materialism taken on its own, it is also unclear what its
rationale is for asserting materialism, even one of this minimalist
variety, which focuses on substances (the person or perhaps the body)
rather than events undergone by substances. One virtue of Anomalous
Monism is that it provides a justification for its form of
materialism. It is also not clear how mental events, when thought of
as not describable in the language of physics, can be held to interact
with events describable in physical language. Here concerns with a
lineage going back to the earliest critics of Descartes, such as
Pierre Gassendi and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, again rear their
heads: if physical but not mental events (which supposedly interact)
have precise spatiotemporal locations, how can events of such
different kinds causally interact, and where is the locus of
interaction? These questions are just as pressing for proponents of
minimal materialism who reject token-identities of mental and physical
events.</p>

<p>
As discussed in
 <a href="index-2.html#ObjTokIde">5.2</a>,
 the spatiotemporal objection to Anomalous Monism is difficult to
evaluate, depending as it does on our own current intuitions about the
intelligibility of recognizing precise spatiotemporal dimensions for
mental events and states. There is also Davidson&rsquo;s later
rejection of the requirement that such descriptions be uniquely
identifying to take into account. Davidson&rsquo;s point, early and
late, however, is that based upon <em>a priori</em> argument we know
that there must be some such description, even if we may never
actually be in a position to make the relevant identifications.</p>

<h3><a name="OthPos">4. Other Positions</a></h3>

<p>
Various other nonreductive monist positions have been developed that
are motivated by concerns very different than those of Anomalous
Monism. These positions raise issues that go beyond what can be
addressed here, but some are worth noting. As observed above, one
motivation derives from concerns with sentient
phenomena&mdash;whether, given distinctive properties attaching to
conscious states and events, they can be explained in terms of
underlying physical states and events. Proponents of these views deny
that such an explanation is possible, and subsequently assert various
forms of property dualism together with a substance monism (see
Chalmers 1996). And another nonreductive monist position has been
motivated by appeal to a semantic thesis concerning how mental
contents of propositional attitudes are determined. Some externalist
views like Davidson&rsquo;s hold that mental contents are determined
in part by physical environmental factors. Others emphasize social
factors, such as the role that experts play in constituting norms of
usage for concepts to which laypeople defer. Some proponents of this
view conclude that the attitudes in which these contents figure cannot
be held to be token-identical to underlying physical states of those
agents, even though all states and events may indeed be physical in
some other sense (Burge 1979, 1993). Davidson (1987a) has forcefully
argued, against this view, that the token-identity theory of mind is
consistent with semantic externalism. (For related discussion, see the
supplement on
 <a href="related-issues.html">Related Issues</a>
 (Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism).)</p>

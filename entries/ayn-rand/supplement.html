<h3 id="Perc">A.1 Perception</h3>


<p>Rand developed her views on perception largely in conversations
with Nathaniel Branden and Leonard Peikoff, who presented them in
lectures.  These views were later elaborated by Kelley (1986), Peikoff
(1991), and others. Rand holds that all knowledge is derived from
perception, and a judgment can be &ldquo;validated&rdquo;
(Rand&rsquo;s term for establishing an idea&rsquo;s basis in reality)
only by tracing it to its foundations at the perceptual level. In this
sense Rand counts as a kind of empiricist. But she rejects the
traditional rationalist/empiricist dichotomy, taking it to embody a
false alternative: rationalism holds that we can deduce knowledge from
concepts acquired without the help of perception, whereas empiricism
holds that we can gain propositional knowledge from experience without
the help of concepts. For Rand, neither is possible: while the senses
provide the raw material of knowledge, conceptual processing is needed
to establish knowable propositions. (Whether Rand&rsquo;s
characterization of rationalists and empiricists is fair is
debatable.)</p>

<p>For Rand the acquisition of knowledge is a process of
differentiation and integration&mdash;of discriminating among objects
of awareness on the basis of their differences, and then uniting the
discriminated phenomena into a cognitively graspable whole. The
process begins at the perceptual level (Rand accepts the existence of
a pre-perceptual form of consciousness which she
calls <em>sensation</em>, but does not assign it much of a role in her
theory), when entities are differentiated from their surroundings and
integrated as unified wholes.</p>

<p>The primary objects of perception&mdash;and the basic building
blocks of Rand&rsquo;s ontology as well&mdash;are <em>entities</em>.
Attributes and actions are secondary; they make sense only as actions
and attributes <em>of</em> entities. This does not mean, however, that
entities are bare substrata underlying their attributes. There is no
such thing as existence other than as some definite thing with a
specific identity; identity is the form that existence takes. Hence an
entity just <em>is</em> the totality of its attributes.</p>

<p>Rand distinguishes two senses of &ldquo;entity&rdquo; (ITOE:
268&ndash;74). In the narrow sense, an entity is an object whose unity
is independent of our consciousness. Rand compares entities in this
sense to Aristotelian primary substances (though without endorsing the
details of Aristotle&rsquo;s hylomorphism), and regards them as the
basic ontological constituents of reality. In the broader sense, an
entity is anything we choose to consider apart from its surroundings,
even if it has no more unity than what we give it in so considering
it&mdash;as when we attend either to parts of entities or to groups of
entities.  Entities in the narrow sense have their entity status
metaphysically, and presumably intrinsically, i.e., as explained
above, apart from their relationship to our consciousness (though this
is a matter of debate in Rand scholarship: Jilk 2003; Bissell
2007). Entities in the broad sense may have their entity status only
epistemologically, that is, only in relation to consciousness. Their
status as <em>existents</em>, however, remains metaphysical. That is,
they really exist apart from our manner of considering them, even if
they do not exist <em>as entities</em> apart from our manner of
considering them.</p>

<p>While Rand sometimes refers to the evidence of the senses as
&ldquo;data&rdquo;, she does not regard the deliverances of the senses
as &ldquo;sense-data&rdquo; understood as features of our subjective
experience; the data of the senses, for her, are genuine extramental
entities and their attributes. Our perceptual faculties place us in
direct contact with reality. In this sense Rand&rsquo;s theory of
perception is a version of direct realism, holding that the objects of
perception are extramental entities (rather than, say, subjective
experiences on the basis of which we infer entities as their
causes).</p>

<p>The validity of sense-perception is not susceptible of proof,
because it is presupposed by all proof, since proof just is a matter
of adducing sensory evidence. Nor can its validity be denied or
questioned, since the very conceptual tools one would have to use to
do this are derived from sensory data and so presuppose their
validity.  Hence perceptual error is not strictly possible, though it
is possible to misinterpret perceptual evidence&mdash;and phenomena
that many would regard as perceptual illusions are instead identified
by Rand either as correct perceptions misinterpreted (e.g., optical
illusions) or as non-perceptions mistaken for perceptions (e.g.,
dreams and hallucinations).  Rand&rsquo;s view here bears interesting
similarities to the contemporary view known
as <a href="../perception-disjunctive/index.html">perceptual disjunctivism</a>.</p>

<p>The formation of concepts and beliefs upon this sensory basis, by
contrast, is a volitional process that is quite definitely capable of
being subject to error. Rand accepts sensory data as a basic,
unquestionable, pre-conceptual starting-point of all knowledge, and so
in that sense embraces a version of the epistemologically
&ldquo;Given&rdquo;. Rand&rsquo;s &ldquo;Given&rdquo;, however, are
extramental entities and their attributes, not propositional judgments
about them; all propositional judgments are products of the
volitional, conceptual level of consciousness and so are potentially
fallible.</p>

<p>Rand rejects the view that some perceptions are of the qualities of
objects as they are independently of us (primary qualities), whereas
others (secondary qualities) are caused by the primary qualities, and
are entirely in the mind (ITOE: 279ff ). Instead, she distinguishes
between the <em>content</em> of a perception and its <em>form</em>;
when we perceive an object as, e.g., square and red, <em>what we
perceive are its intrinsic features in a certain</em> <em>form</em>, a
form that is determined by the nature of the object, the nature of our
perceptual organs, and the environment. Thus, we perceive the
object&rsquo;s shape as square, and the reflectance properties of its
surface as red; both are the result of the interaction of our
perceptual organs with what is out there. Neither squareness nor
redness belong either to the object apart from our mode of perception,
or to our mode of perception apart from the object in its environment.
Hence, these attributes are neither intrinsic nor subjective but
relational and objective (Kelley 1986; Peikoff 1991).</p>

<p>Thus while Rand is a <em>direct</em> realist in the sense explained
above, she is not a <em>naive</em> realist in the sense of regarding
all perceived attributes as enjoying equal extramental status. It is
possible for us to misidentify features of a perception&rsquo;s form
as belonging to its content (and presumably vice versa). But Rand does
not regard this fact as impugning the reliability of the senses, since
the judgment that a particular feature belongs to a perception&rsquo;s
content rather than its form is not contributed by the perception
itself but is a volitionally, fallibly formed conceptual response to
that perception.</p>

<p>Nor is the existence of features belonging to the form rather than
the content of perception indicative of any flaw in our perceptual
faculties. On the contrary, every process must have some definite
nature and occur by some definite means; thus it is inevitable, on
Rand&rsquo;s view, that the way objects appear to us should depend on
the nature of our perceptual organs. The fact that the form of our
knowledge is partly determined by the means by which it is acquired
does not invalidate its status as knowledge. To assume otherwise would
be, in effect, to conclude that &ldquo;you can know nothing, because
you know it by means of something&rdquo;&mdash;that you are
&ldquo;blind &hellip; because you have eyes, and deaf &hellip; because
you have ears&rdquo; (1997: 655). Nor, again, should the discovery
that attributes like color are not intrinsic features of entities be
taken to imply their subjectivity. Inasmuch as such attributes depend
not on consciousness alone but rather on the relationship between
consciousness and its objects, they are neither intrinsic nor
subjective, but rather objective. (Thus an entity can exist
intrinsically even if some of its attributes exist only
objectively.)</p>

<p>Rand rejects Kant&rsquo;s idea of innate conceptual categories on
the grounds that it confuses the form of thought with the object and
content of thought, thus cutting us off from reality (ITOE,
Ch. 8). Some critics, however, see Rand&rsquo;s own distinction as
strikingly reminiscent of Kant (Walsh 2000). Critics also argue that
Rand makes the reliability of perception vacuous (since nothing counts
as perception unless it&rsquo;s accurate); assumes a foundationalist
approach that conflates the perceptual process by which judgments are
formed with the way in which they are to be justified; and leaves it
unclear how judgments with propositional structure can be validated by
sensory data lacking such structure (Dipert 1987; Long 2000). On the
positive side, several philosophers have developed Rand&rsquo;s theory
of perception in a way that engages with problems in contemporary
analytic epistemology (Kelley 1986; Ghate 2013; Salmieri 2013).</p>

<h3 id="TheoConc">A.2 Theory of Concepts</h3>

<p>The process of differentiation and integration that begins at the
perceptual level continues at the level of concept-formation, as we
selectively attend to certain attributes of an entity, discriminate it
from entities lacking those attributes, and mentally group it together
with entities that share the attributes. This makes it possible to
treat entities as units, that is, as members of a group (ITOE; Kelley
1984; Kelley and Krueger 1984; Peikoff 1991). An entity&rsquo;s status
as a unit is not intrinsic, since the basis of its status is our
mental process of differentiation and integration. But neither is its
status subjective, because the process is based on actually existing
similarities and differences. Its status is, therefore, objective.
Consequently, Rand rejects as a false alternative the debate between
realists and nominalists over the nature of universals.
(&ldquo;Realism&rdquo;, as a theory about universals, is to be
distinguished from the kind of perceptual realism that Rand accepts.)
Rand identifies universals with concepts, understood as attributes of
consciousness, and so repudiates the intrinsicism of the realists; for
Rand, the problem of universals belongs to epistemology, not to
metaphysics. But because she takes concepts to be objective in her
sense, Rand likewise distinguishes her theory from nominalism, which
she interprets as a subjectivist approach to universals.</p>

<p>Attributes can also be regarded as units. This makes possible the
process of <em>measurement</em>, which involves relating perceptible
attribute-units to larger or smaller quantities, including those too
large or too small to perceive, thus permitting the expansion of our
knowledge beyond the perceptual level. Measurement is here understood
broadly, as covering ordinal as well as cardinal relationships, and
thus applies to all concepts, not just narrowly quantitative ones.
Concepts expand the range of our knowledge by reducing the number of
units with which we must deal.</p>

<p>Rand holds a &ldquo;measurement-omission&rdquo; theory of
abstraction; that is, she regards concept-formation as a matter of
grouping items together on the basis of a commensurable characteristic
while omitting the specific measurements (e.g., grouping red objects
together while omitting specific shades of red). Such abstraction does
not falsify its objects, as in omitting specific measurements we do
not claim that they do not exist, we merely omit to specify them. (On
this point Rand arguably follows the Aristotelian tradition; see Long
2006.) The similarities on the basis of which we form our earliest
concepts are perceptually identified; more sophisticated concepts
involve conceptually identified similarities.</p>

<p>The extramental attributes on the basis of which we form our
concepts are presumably intended by Rand to be particulars, not
universals (since otherwise she would be a traditional realist). But
Rand says little about the metaphysical status of the
&ldquo;similarity&rdquo; or &ldquo;sameness&rdquo; that we identify
among such attribute-particulars. Theories of universals traditionally
seek to account both for generic identity across specific difference
(e.g., how redness applies to two distinct shades of red), and
specific identity across numerical difference (e.g., how a specific
shade of red applies to two particulars of that shade). Rand&rsquo;s
theory of measurement-omission seems primarily intended to address the
former issue; she has little to say about the latter. Rand&rsquo;s
insistence that everything in reality is particular has been taken by
critics as undermining the possibility of the mind-independent
similarities needed to ground the objectivity of concepts (for how can
two objects be similar if there&rsquo;s nothing real that they share
in common?). But it is possible that Rand would regard similarities as
themselves being relational property-particulars or tropes, rather
than universals, so that the canine-similarity between Fido and Lassie
would be a different particular from the canine-similarity between
Lassie and Snoopy.</p>

<p>Abstractions, once formed, are &ldquo;open-ended&rdquo;, applying
not just to the specific concretes from which they were formed but to
all concretes of the same kind. The characteristics on the basis of
which items are conceptually grouped should be <em>essential</em>,
that is, explanatorily fundamental; but since Rand regards explanation
as an epistemological rather than a metaphysical category, essences
are objective, not intrinsic. These essential characteristics also
determine the definition of the concept. Both the process of forming a
concept, for example, table, and the process of arriving at a
definition, correspond to the two main functions of conciousness:
integration and differentiation (ITOE: 41). The genus of table
integrates it with other existents of the same kind (chairs,
cupboards, etc.), whereas its differentia distinguishes it from other
existents of the same kind (and, of course, other kinds). However, the
meaning of a concept lies not in its definition but in its referents,
where membership in the class of referents is determined not by
anything like Fregean &ldquo;sense&rdquo;, but rather by a prospective
member&rsquo;s fundamental similarities (whether as yet known or
unknown) to the original concretes on which the concept is
based. Definitions are context-relative and can change in response to
new discoveries without changing the concept itself. What, then, is an
objective definition, valid for everyone? It is the definition based
on &ldquo;the widest context of knowledge available to man on the
subjects relevant to the units of a given concept&rdquo; (ITOE:
46). Because concepts do not change when their definitions change with
the growth of knowledge, we have continuity of reference. Indeed, the
growth of human knowledge would be impossible without this stability
and open-endedness of concepts (ITOE: 27&ndash;8, 66&ndash;67). The
development of science, then, does not threaten scientific objectivity
or progress, as some have claimed (Feyerabend 1965; Kuhn
1970). Rather, the development of the conceptual structure of science
illustrates Rand&rsquo;s theory of concepts and cognitive development
(Lennox 2013). Rand rejects the analytic-synthetic distinction; that
is, she denies any significant difference in metaphysical or modal
status, as well as in means of being known, between those
characteristics of a class that are and those that are not mentioned
in the definition. Despite various differences, Rand&rsquo;s overall
discussion of reference obviously bears intriguing similarities to the
realist theories of reference developed by Saul Kripke and Hilary
Putnam during the 1970s, although Rand developed her ideas
independently, their earliest statement appearing in the
1966&ndash;1967 issues of her periodical <em>The Objectivist</em>.</p>

<p>Critics have objected that Rand offers no argument against the
possibility that <em>some</em> concepts may have their referents
determined by the definition (Browne 2000; Long 2005a,b). Rand
describes the meaning of &ldquo;capitalism&rdquo;, for example, as
&ldquo;full, pure, uncontrolled, unregulated laissez-faire&rdquo;
(1964a: 33). Since Rand does not regard such as a system as ever
having existed, it&rsquo;s hard to see how the concept of
&ldquo;capitalism&rdquo; could have been formed on the basis of its
referents (what referents?). If instead Rand&rsquo;s definition of
&ldquo;capitalism&rdquo; serves as the <em>criterion</em> to determine
what would count as a referent, then some statements will be
&ldquo;true by definition&rdquo; after all, thereby potentially
resurrecting the analytic-synthetic distinction.</p>

<p>Concepts (or attempts at concepts) that group their purported
referents according to non-essential or inconsistent characteristics,
or otherwise embody mistaken presuppositions&mdash;such as
&ldquo;phlogiston, &rdquo; or &ldquo;extremism&rdquo; (which
implicitly treats any consistent or thoroughgoing conviction as bad,
regardless of its content)&mdash;are invalid and cannot be rationally
used. In Rand&rsquo;s view, &ldquo;anti-concepts&rdquo; or
&ldquo;package deals&rdquo; like &ldquo;extremism&rdquo; or
&ldquo;selfishness&rdquo; are frequently employed as an ideological
strategy to hinder people&rsquo;s ability to grasp politically
inconvenient concepts. Rand&rsquo;s theory of concepts thus has a
normative dimension (Gotthelf 2013). Judgments that deny their own
conceptual presuppositions are likewise invalid. The possibility that
all of our experience is a dream, for example, is rejected as what
Rand calls a &ldquo;stolen concept&rdquo; fallacy, since possession of
the concept &ldquo;dream&rdquo; presupposes the ability to distinguish
dreaming from waking. This is because genuine possession of a concept
requires both the ability to derive an abstraction from concretes and
the ability to go on to apply it to new concretes; if all our
experience were a dream, the concept of waking could neither be
derived from nor applied to any concretes. Those who claim to have
grasped a concept but are unable to recognize instances of it
&ldquo;have not performed either part of the cycle: neither the
abstraction nor the translating of the abstraction into the
concrete&rdquo;. As with an electric circuit, &ldquo;no part of it can
be of any use, until and unless the cycle is completed&rdquo; (Journal
entry for 4 May 1946, in 1997: 481).</p>

<p>Thus many people who appear to be operating at the conceptual level
may not in fact be fully doing so. Rand appeals to this
&ldquo;anti-conceptual mentality&rdquo;&mdash;the result of laziness
or miseducation&mdash;to explain the prevalence of thoughtless social
conformity, since those who have not mastered higher abstractions are
compelled to navigate the social world by imitating the concrete
behavior of other people. In other words, for an anti-conceptual
mentality a concept like &ldquo;justice&rdquo; would simply refer to
the concrete practices that people in a given society engage in when
they use the term, thereby forestalling the possibility of any
critical reflection on the actual justice of those practices (1982a:
ch. 4; 1999a: ch. 3).</p>

<h3 id="ExisIdenCons">A.3 Existence, Identity, and Consciousness</h3>

<p>Epistemologically, the most important concepts are those Rand
identifies as <em>axiomatic</em> concepts. (Axioms themselves are
secondary, being propositional expressions of the corresponding
concepts, which themselves are non-propositional.) The three axiomatic
concepts to which Rand devotes the most attention
are <em>existence</em>, <em>identity</em>, and <em>consciousness.</em>
These three, she tells us, are implicit in all knowledge, and cannot
be rejected without being relied upon in the course of the attempted
rejection. Unlike ordinary concepts, they are not susceptible of
definition (except ostensively), because there are no more basic
concepts in terms of which they could be defined. Nor are the axioms
that express them susceptible of proof, since they are presupposed by
all proof (ITOE; Peikoff 1991).</p>

<p>The concept of existence identifies as basic and unquestionable the
fact that something exists; to ask for a cause or explanation of there
being something rather than nothing is to misunderstand the place of
existence in the hierarchy of concepts. (This is one of Rand&rsquo;s
reasons for rejecting the idea of a divine creator as the cause of the
universe; though it is a matter of dispute whether this objection
works if such a creator is merely supposed to be responsible for the
existence of everything <em>other than itself</em>.) Rand&rsquo;s
expression of this concept in propositional form, as the axiom that
&ldquo;existence exists&rdquo;, is intended not as the mere
tautological observation that &ldquo;whatever exists, exists&rdquo;,
but rather as a recognition that something does indeed exist.</p>

<p>The concept of identity identifies the fact that everything that
exists is <em>some kind</em> of thing or other&mdash;that it has a
specific, non-contradictory nature. This concept&mdash;which Rand
often expresses in propositional form as the Law of Identity,
&ldquo;<em>A</em> is <em>A</em>&rdquo;&mdash;has as a corollary the
principle of causality: since everything has a specific nature, a
thing can act only in ways consistent with that nature.</p>

<p>Finally, the concept of consciousness identifies the fact that
consciousness exists; Rand agrees with the Cartesian view that one
cannot coherently deny the existence of one&rsquo;s own
consciousness. Unlike Descartes, however, Rand denies the &ldquo;prior
certainty of consciousness&rdquo;, i.e., the idea that we can be aware
of the contents of our own minds without knowing whether any
extramental reality corresponds to them; for Rand, there can be no
content without an external reality. Rand regards consciousness as
inherently relational: to be conscious is to be conscious of something
beyond one&rsquo;s own consciousness, and of one&rsquo;s consciousness
itself only secondarily.</p>

<p>Existence has primacy over consciousness both epistemologically and
metaphysically (with the latter explaining the former):
epistemologically, because consciousness has to be aware of a distinct
object before it can be aware of itself; metaphysically, because
consciousness is a response to its objects and so cannot precede
them&mdash;thus ruling out metaphysical theories like theism and
idealism that, in Rand&rsquo;s view, make existence dependent on
consciousness.</p>

<p>From the fact that consciousness&mdash;both perceptual and
conceptual&mdash;is an active and causally complex process, it does
not follow that it is creative or distortive with regard to its
objects. To suppose otherwise, Rand holds&mdash;to demand that
consciousness, in order to be in contact with reality, must be purely
passive and not involve any sort of processing&mdash;is to object to
consciousness on the absurd grounds that it has a specific identity
and employs specific means, and thus, once again, to regard us as
blind because we have eyes and deaf because we have ears.</p>

<p>According to Rand, as we&rsquo;ve seen, our senses cannot deceive
us; and in forming conceptual judgments on the basis of sensory
evidence, we can be deceived only if we allow ourselves to fall into
inattention or evasion. Hence certainty is always available to us. But
while Rand takes knowledge to require certainty, she distinguishes
certainty from infallibility or inerrancy: a judgment can
be <em>certain</em>, within a given context of available knowledge,
even if it needs to be revised in the light of new
information. Peikoff interprets Rand to hold that, so long as a
contextual qualifier is understood to be implicit in one&rsquo;s
judgments at each stage (e.g., &ldquo;So far as can be determined in
the light of present knowledge &hellip;&rdquo;), the revised judgments
need not contradict the original ones (Peikoff 1991). But this is a
problematic notion, and Rand herself never makes any statement to this
effect.</p>

<p>Rand rejects both dogmatism (asserting knowledge or demanding
assent in the absence of contextually sufficient evidence) and
skepticism (denying knowledge, or demanding the withholding of assent,
in the presence of contextually sufficient
evidence). Mysticism&mdash;in the sense of claims to a non-rational,
non-sensory mode of knowledge&mdash;is likewise rejected as a form of
dogmatism. The application of logic&mdash;the &ldquo;art of
non-contradictory identification&rdquo;&mdash;to sensory data should
be the sole ultimate determinant of belief.</p>

<h3 id="MetaHumaNatu">A.4 Metaphysics of Human Nature</h3>

<p>Rand&rsquo;s conception of the role of metaphysics is fairly
minimalist; its task is the investigation of the most general features
of existence as such&mdash;of &ldquo;being <em>qua</em> being&rdquo;,
in Aristotle&rsquo;s phrase. Hence a great deal of traditionally
metaphysical inquiry into the specific characteristics of the universe
and its constituents she regards as properly the province of the
special sciences rather than philosophy. Moreover, consistent with her
conviction that many of the central issues of philosophy turn on
phenomena that are properly to be understood as objective rather than
intrinsic, she tends to assign a broader role to epistemology than to
metaphysics. For Rand, metaphysics tells us that entities have
definite natures, epistemology tells us how to investigate those
natures, and the special sciences then do the actual
investigating.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Rand does take a stand on a number of metaphysical
questions more specific than the priority of existence to
consciousness or of entities to attributes. For example, Rand denies
the possibility of actualized infinities (as opposed to potential
infinities, in the Aristotelian sense of processes that can be
continued indefinitely), on the grounds that the axiom of identity
requires every magnitude to be of some definite measurable extent. On
the other hand, Rand maintains that given the character of existence
as basic and unquestionable, it makes no sense to think of reality as
a whole coming into or going out of existence; the universe is a
fundamental fact that cannot be created or destroyed but has always
existed. It&rsquo;s not clear whether Rand holds that the universe is
infinitely old (a position that would seem to sit oddly with her
denial of actualized infinities&mdash;though of course Aristotle held
the same combination of views), or only that it was not preceded by a
temporal period of nothingness (a potentially distinct claim if one
holds, as Rand does, that the passage of time requires change).</p>

<p>But most of Rand&rsquo;s more specific metaphysical theses have to
do with the nature of one particular type of entities&mdash;human
beings. Rand regards human beings, and indeed living organisms
generally, as teleologically ordered systems, though her teleology
takes a naturalized form that makes no essential reference to
purposiveness; her point is simply that organisms depend for their
existence on the successful carrying out&mdash;conscious or
otherwise&mdash;of self-maintenance activities, and so are necessarily
organized around the goal of furthering their life functions. Rand
rejects both substance dualism and reductive materialism, holding that
a human being is an integrated unit of mind and body, a unified
entity, with mental characteristics neither separable from nor fully
explicable in terms of physical ones. (Whether Rand&rsquo;s position
is best identified as property dualism, nonreductive physicalism, or
neither is unclear.)</p>

<p>Consciousness is not epiphenomenal, but rather is causally
efficacious&mdash;or, perhaps more precisely, human beings are
causally efficacious in virtue, <em>inter alia</em>, of possessing
consciousness; we know this on the basis of direct experience.
Moreover, while perception is automatic, at the conceptual level the
operation of consciousness is free from causal necessitation. The
reality of incompatibilist free will is axiomatic, since the
conceptual tools needed to question its reality presuppose our
volitional command over our thought-processes, and in particular, our
ability to raise or lower our level of mental alertness&mdash;inasmuch
as our ability to judge whether we are reasoning correctly presupposes
that our thinking is not directed by factors beyond our knowledge and
control (N.  Branden 
1971).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup></p>

<p>Free choices are not uncaused, since for Rand actions (in general,
not just human actions) are caused not by prior events but by the
natures of the entities involved. There is even a sense in which free
choices are necessitated&mdash;namely, it is necessary that human
beings, given their nature as conscious rational beings, make free
choices, though it is not necessary that they choose this rather than
that.</p>

<p>Beyond the realm of human choice, however, Rand regards all facts
and events as necessary and &ldquo;metaphysically given&rdquo;. Rand
seems to consider this position a corollary of the primacy of
existence, though it is unclear, given Rand&rsquo;s exception for
human choice, why there could not also be entities whose nature was
such as to behave probabilistically, as postulated by many
interpretations of quantum physics. (By contrast, the distinct view
that a quantum particle&rsquo;s <em>present state</em> is merely
probabilistic clashes much more obviously with the primacy of
existence.)</p>

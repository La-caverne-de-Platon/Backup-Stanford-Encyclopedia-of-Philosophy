<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">The Legal Concept of Evidence</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a> 
It is an indication of the breadth and unsettledness of the field that
philosophical surveys of legal evidence differ greatly on the issues
that are covered. For other surveys, see, e.g., Schum 1998, Goldman
2005, and Jackson and Doran 2010.</p></div>

<div id="note-2">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
The law of evidence deals with evidence and
proof in connection with resolving disputes of fact. Lawyers argue in
court not just over propositions of fact but also over propositions of
law. This entry does not deal with how lawyers argue about the law.
Lawson 2017 claims that propositions of fact and propositions of law
are amenable to analysis under the same formal structure of proof.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a> The definition
drafted by Stephen reads as follows: </p>

<blockquote><p> &ldquo;Evidence&rdquo; means and includes&mdash;(1)
all statements which the Court permits or requires to be made before
it by witnesses&hellip;; such statements are called oral evidence (2)
all documents produced for the inspection of the Court; all such
documents are called documentary evidence. </p></blockquote></div>

<div id="note-4">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a> To these three is
sometimes added a fourth category of &ldquo;demonstrative
evidence&rdquo; which &ldquo;includes maps, charts, diagrams,
models&rdquo; (Schum 1994: 93).  These devices serve as aids in
presenting and understanding evidence.</p></div>

<div id="note-5">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a> As Schum, 1994: 19,
observes, there is a distinction &ldquo;between evidence and the
actual or factual occurrence of the event(s) reported in
evidence&rdquo;. This distinction is also drawn by Wigmore (1937: 45,
318&ndash;320) and Keynes (1921: 181).</p></div>

<div id="note-6">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a> Bentham 1825 is a
one-volume English translation of Dumont&rsquo;s French edition of
Bentham&rsquo;s papers on evidence. Bentham 1827 is a five-volume
edition that was prepared by John S. Mill. A statement similar to the
one quoted in the text appears in the latter edition, in vol. 4, at
572: </p>

<blockquote><p> Irrelevant evidence is evidence that bears no
efficient relation to the fact which it is brought to prove: evidence
which proves nothing: as well might one say, no
evidence. </p></blockquote></div>

<div id="note-7">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a> It states:
&ldquo;Relevant evidence is admissible unless any [legal rule]
provides otherwise.  Irrelevant evidence is not admissible&rdquo;.</p></div>

<div id="note-8">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a> For a
non-mathematical theory of probability that has been applied to legal
fact-finding, see Cohen 1977, 1986, discussed in section 3.3.</p></div>

<div id="note-9">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a> However, evidence,
although relevant, may be excluded at the court&rsquo;s discretion. An
example of such a power can be found in Rule 403 of the Federal Rules
of Evidence in the United States; this provision allows the court to</p>

<blockquote><p> exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is
substantially outweighed by a danger of&hellip;unfair prejudice,
confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time,
or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.</p></blockquote>

<p>
When evidence is excluded under Rule 403, it is notwithstanding that
it is legally relevant under the aforementioned Rule 401 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence. Cf. Pattenden, 1996&ndash;7, citing (mainly
English) cases which suggest that to be legally relevant, the evidence
must be logically relevant to the degree that is sufficient to offset
any countervailing considerations (similar to the types mentioned in
Rule 403) that may arise.</p></div>

<div id="note-10">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a> See, e.g., the
definition of &ldquo;relevance&rdquo; in Rule 401 of the Federal Rules
of Evidence in the United States: it is not enough that the evidence
has a &ldquo;tendency to make a fact more or less probable&rdquo;; in
addition, it must also be shown that &ldquo;the fact is of consequence
in determining the action.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div id="note-11">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a> A similar
definition of hearsay is provided in the United States&rsquo; Federal
Rule of Evidence 801: an out-of-court statement is hearsay if offered
&ldquo;in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the
statement&rdquo;.</p></div>

<div id="note-12">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a> Sometimes, the
relevance of an item of evidence is said to be conditional on the
existence of another fact (Morgan 1929; US
Federal Rules of Evidence 104(b)). But this doctrine of
&ldquo;conditional relevance&rdquo; has been criticised on two
separate arguments: first, that evidence that is said to be
&ldquo;conditionally&rdquo; relevant is already relevant or, secondly,
that no evidence is ever relevant in its own right (Ball 1980; Allen
1992, Wigmore 1983a, &sect;14.1; cf. Nance 1990, Friedman 1994).</p></div>

<div id="note-13">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a> Tribe 1971 was
one of the first to caution against the use of mathematical reasoning
about probabilities in law. Among other objections, he raises the fear
that &ldquo;the overbearing impressiveness of numbers&rdquo; (Tribe
1971: 1361) might &ldquo;dwarf all efforts to put it into perspective
with more impressionistic sorts of evidence&rdquo; (Tribe 1971: 1360),
and that allowing a criminal conviction on an explicit quantification
of the risk of error will suggest, wrongly, that the law authorises
&ldquo;the imposition of criminal punishment when the trier recognizes
a quantifiable doubt as to the defendant&rsquo;s guilt&rdquo; (Tribe
1971: 1374).</p></div>

<div id="note-14">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
For further discussion of this topic, see the entry on 
 <a href="../legal-probabilism/index.html">legal probabilism</a>.
<p></div>

<div id="note-15">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a> As acknowledged
by Justice Harlan in the United States&rsquo; Supreme Court case
of <em>In Re Winship</em>, 1970, 397 U.S. 358, 371&ndash;372. The most
famous expression of this relative weighting of likely harms is the
Blackstonian dictum that &ldquo;it is better that ten guilty persons
escape, than that one innocent suffer&rdquo; (Blackstone 1770:
352).</p></div>

<div id="note-16">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a> Kaplow 2012
proposes a radical reform of the law. The evidential threshold should
be set at the level that maximizes social welfare. Unlike the
conventional ex post perspective, which focuses on the likelihood of
acts that have allegedly been committed and on the &ldquo;direct
operational costs&rdquo; of &ldquo;erroneous assignment of
liability&rdquo; (at 746), Kaplow&rsquo;s theory adopts an <em>ex
ante</em> perspective that considers the likely impact of the choice
of evidential threshold on social behavior at large. Demanding
stronger evidence as a prerequisite to imposing liability would make
it more difficult to attract legal sanctions. This will decrease the
deterrence of the law (as a result of people knowing that it is now
easier to get away with harmful acts) and reduce its chilling effect
(people will be less likely to exercise excessive caution and refrain
from engaging in benign acts for fear of having sanctions mistakenly
imposed on them). Conversely, lowering the evidential demand will have
the opposite effects. The optimal threshold is one that maximizes
deterrence while minimizing chilling. For detailed criticisms of
Kaplow&rsquo;s proposal on practical, conceptual, and other grounds,
see Allen and Stein 2013.</p></div>

<div id="note-17">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a> Adopting insights
from contextualist theories of epistemic justification, Amaya argues
in favour of context-sensitive standards of justification for legal
fact-finding. On her coherence based theory of justification,
contextual factors such as the stakes involved in the case constrain
(i) the size of the set of factual hypotheses and evidence which the
fact-finder must attend to (these are ground materials for
constructing alternative theories of the case), (ii) the number of
alternative theories of the case that must be considered, and (iii)
the degree of coherence that the most coherent of the alternative
theories must satisfy (Amaya 2015: 525&ndash;531).</p></div>

<div id="note-18">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
If you think that the probabilistic threshold should be
higher, we can easily vary the number of prisoners such that the
probability of guilt exceeds the higher threshold.
</p></div>

<div id="note-19">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a> There is a large
literature on Bayesian analysis in legal fact-finding. Monographs
include Eggleston 1983, Schum 1994, Robertson and Vignaux
1995. Special journal issues include <em>Boston University Law
Review</em>, 1986, vol. 66, nos. 3 and 4 (Symposium
issue, <em>Probability and Inference in the Law of Evidence</em>),
republished as Tillers and Green 1988 and <em>International
Journal of Evidence and Proof</em>, 1997, vol. 1 (Allen and Redmayne (eds),
special issue on <em>Bayesianism and Juridical Proof</em>). Four
practitioner guides on communicating and interpreting statistical
evidence in the administration of criminal justice have been
published by the Royal Statistical Society;
of these, two are especially relevant: Aitken, Roberts and Jackson
2010 and Roberts and
Aitken 2014.  Variations of Bayesian analysis have been suggested:
for, e.g., the quasi-objective Bayesianism proposed by Goldman (2002
and 2005) incorporates an objective element.</p></div>

<div id="note-20">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a> Haack&rsquo;s
&ldquo;epistemological argument that under certain conditions, a
congeries of evidence warrants a conclusion to a higher degree than
any of its components alone would do&rdquo; (Haack 2008a: 253) is one
that is long recognised in the legal literature on the analysis of
circumstantial evidence: see, e.g., Wills 1852: 161&ndash;164.</p></div>

<div id="note-21">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a> See Amaya 2015:
94&ndash;103, for a comprehensive survey of other holistic theories of
evidence and legal proof.</p></div>

<div id="note-22">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a> For other models
of legal fact-finding based on abductive reasoning and inference to
the best explanation, see Josephson 2001; Schum 2001; Abimbola 2001;
Amaya 2009, 2015.</p></div>

<div id="note-23">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
For detailed consideration of the theory,
see the 2019 special issue of the <em>International Journal of
Evidence and Proof</em>, volume 23, number 1-2, containing a paper by
Allen and Pardo, twenty responses to the paper by commentators and a
reply.
</p></div>

<div id="note-24">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a> For a rigorous
and detailed treatment of coherence, see the coherence-based theory of
justification for legal fact-finding proposed by Amaya (2008, 2011,
2013, 2015).</p></div>

<div id="note-25">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
Nance 2016 offers a comprehensive discussion.
</p></div>

<div id="note-26">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a> It is unclear
whether it is enough to satisfy the standard of proof beyond
reasonable doubt for the prosecution&rsquo;s hypothesis to survive the
challenges or tests that it has been put through at the trial. On
Cohen&rsquo;s theory, the criminal standard is satisfied only by a
maximization of the weight of evidence. Weight is ascertained by
comparing the evidence made available at the trial with the supposed
totality of relevant facts and not the supposed totality
of <em>discoverable</em> relevant facts. On Cohen&rsquo;s theory, if a
&ldquo;vital eyewitness has died without disclosing what he
saw&rdquo;, the prosecution&rsquo;s case would lack maximal weight and
must fail, and this is irrespective, it seems, of how much other
evidence is adduced in the case (Cohen 1986: 642; cf.  Nance 2008:
280, n. 7, noting that this conclusion is not easy to reconcile with
actual criminal litigation).</p></div>

<div id="note-27">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a> Cohen&rsquo;s
work has influenced another theory of weight which is even more
complex than his. According to Stein (2005: 81), probability estimates
differ in weight, depending on its &ldquo;evidential
credentials&rdquo;. The larger the extent to which the evidence
&ldquo;confirms the specific facts that form the examined
hypothesis&rdquo; (Stein 2005: 82) and the more
&ldquo;resilient&rdquo; the probability assessment is (in the sense of
its ability to survive changes in informational base with the
introduction of new evidence) (Stein 2005: 48), the greater the
weight.  This leads him to propose the principle of maximal
individualization, according to which the court must receive and
consider all &ldquo;case-specific evidence&rdquo; pertaining to the
dispute and must not make any finding against a litigant unless it
rests on argument and supporting evidence that have been exposed to
and that survive &ldquo;maximal individualised examination&rdquo;
(Stein 2005: 100). The latter bears resemblance to Cohen&rsquo;s idea
of weight as a matter of testing hypothesis. On the difficulties in
pining down and assessing Stein&rsquo;s theory, see Redmayne (2006),
Pardo (2007) and Nance (2007a).</p></div>

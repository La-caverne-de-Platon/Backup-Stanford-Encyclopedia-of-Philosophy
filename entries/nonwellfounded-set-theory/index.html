<h1>Non-wellfounded Set Theory</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Apr 16, 2008; substantive revision Tue Apr 24, 2018</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
 This entry is about two kinds of circularity: <em>object
circularity</em>, where an object is taken to be part of itself in
some sense; and <em>definition circularity</em>, where a collection is
defined in terms of itself.  Instances of these two kinds of
circularity are sometimes problematic, and sometimes not.  We are
primarily interested in object circularity in this entry, especially
instances which look problematic when one tries to model them in set
theory.  But we shall also discuss circular definitions.</p>

<p>
 The term <em>non-wellfounded set</em> refers to sets which contain
themselves as members, and more generally which are part of an
infinite sequence of sets each term of which is an element of the
preceding set.  So they exhibit object circularity in a blatant way.
Discussion of such sets is very old in the history of set theory, but
non-wellfounded sets are ruled out of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (the
standard theory) due to the Foundation Axiom (<em>FA</em>).  As it happens,
there are alternatives to this axiom <em>FA</em>.  This entry is especially
concerned with one of them, an axiom first formulated by Marco Forti
and Furio Honsell in a 1983 paper.  It is now standard to call this principle the
<em>Anti-Foundation Axiom</em> (<em>AFA</em>), following its treatment in an
influential book written by Peter Aczel in 1988.</p>

<p>
 The attraction of using <em>AFA</em> is that it gives a set of tools for
modeling circular phenomena of various sorts.  These tools are
connected to important circular definitions, as we shall see.  We
shall also be concerned with situating both the mathematics and the
underlying intuitions in a broader picture, one derived from work in
<em>coalgebra</em>.
Incorporating concepts and results from category theory,
coalgebra leads us to concepts such as <em>corecursion</em>
and <em>coinduction</em>; these are in a sense duals to the more
standard notions of <em>recursion</em>
and <em>induction</em>.
</p>

<p>
 The topic of this entry also has connections to work in game theory
(the universal Harsanyi type spaces), semantics (especially
situation-theoretic accounts, or others where a &ldquo;world&rdquo; is allowed
to be part of itself), fractals sets and other self-similar sets, the
analysis of recursion, category theory, and the philosophical side of
set theory.</p>

<h2><a name="1">1. Circular Phenomena in Set Theory</a></h2>

<p>
 It is difficult to say in a general way what makes a definition
circular.  In this entry we are concerned exclusively with
mathematical definitions of various sorts.  Consider the equation
<em>x</em> = &frac12;<em>x</em> + 1.  Is this a <em>circular
definition</em> of the number 2?  In a sense, it is just that: a
number has been defined in terms of itself.  But there is nothing
problematic about this equation, and so one may wonder why this is in
the same class of equations as <em>x</em> = <em>x</em> + 1, or
<em>x</em> = <em>x</em>.  In the set theoretic setting, we often
employ circular definitions and characterizations of sets and classes.
For example, the collection <em>HF</em> of <em>hereditarily
finite sets</em> may be characterized by </p>

<blockquote>
 <p>
 (1) <em>HF</em> is the set of all <em>x</em> such that <em>x</em> is
a finite subset of <em>HF</em>.
</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
 With a bit of work, it can be shown that (1) defines a unique set in
standard set theory <em>ZFC</em>.  (1) is more of a
<em>characterization</em> than a textbook definition, however.  In
other words, if one were presented with (1) as a putative
definition, then the first step in understanding it
 would be to &ldquo;straighten out&rdquo; the circularity by providing
a different definition <em>D</em> of a set, then to check that every
set satisfying <em>D</em> satisfies the property defining <em>HF</em>,
and vice-versa.</p>

<p>
 It is easier to think about circular <em>objects</em> than circular
<em>definitions</em>.  Even so, it will be useful in reading this
entry to keep circular definitions in mind.  The most conspicuous form
of object circularity would be a set having itself as an element; even
worse would be a set <em>x</em> such that <em>x</em> = {<em>x</em>}.
For those with a background in standard set theory, such sets are
ruled out by the axioms in the first place, and in the second it is
not clear why one would want to change the axioms in order to admit
them.  And if one does take the drastic step of altering the axioms of
a well-established theory, what changes?  This entry is an extended
discussion of this matter, and related ones.</p>

<a name="sectionstreams"></a>
<h3>1.1 Streams</h3>

<p>
 Many of the ideas in this entry may be illustrated using
<em>streams</em>.  A <em>stream of numbers</em> is an ordered pair
whose first coordinate is a number and whose second coordinate is
again a stream of numbers.  The first coordinate is called the
<em>head</em>, and the second the <em>tail</em>.  The tail of a given
stream might be different from it, but again, it might be the very
same stream.  For example, consider the stream <em>s</em> whose head
is 0 and whose tail is <em>s</em> again.  Thus the tail of the tail of
<em>s</em> is <em>s</em> itself.  We have <em>s</em> =
&lang;0,&thinsp;<em>s</em>&rang; , 
 <em>s</em> = 
&lang;0,&thinsp;&lang;0,&thinsp;<em>s</em>&rang; &thinsp;&rang; ,
  etc. This stream <em>s</em> exhibits object circularity.  It is natural to
&ldquo;unravel&rdquo; its definition as:</p>

<blockquote>
 (0,0,&hellip;,0,&hellip;)
</blockquote>

<p>
It is natural to understand the
unraveled form as an <em>infinite sequence</em>; standardly,
infinite sequences are taken to be functions whose domain is the set
<em>N</em> of natural numbers.  So we can take the unraveled form to
be the constant function with value 0.  Whether we want to take the
stream <em>s</em> described above to <em>be</em> this function is an
issue we want to explore in a general way in this entry.  Notice that
since we defined <em>s</em> to be an ordered pair, it follows from the
way pairs are constructed in ordinary mathematics that <em>s</em> will
not itself be the constant sequence 0.</p>

<p>
 One way to define streams is with <em>systems of equations</em> for them.
For example, here is such a system:</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td valign="top">(2)</td>
<td><em>x</em> &asymp; 
&lang;0,&thinsp;<em>y</em>&rang; </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><em>y</em>  &asymp;  
&lang;1,&thinsp;<em>z</em>&rang; </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><em>z</em>  &asymp;  
&lang;2,&thinsp;<em>x</em>&rang; </td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 We should comment on the &asymp; notation here.  We are concerned
with modeling various types of ordinary mathematical objects in set
theory, and one kind of object that we want to model will be that of a
<em>system of equations</em>.  This is an unusual thing to do.  In
anticipation of things to come, we use the &asymp; sign for
<em>equations we would like to solve</em>.  So in our discussion of
<em>x</em> = &frac12;<em>x</em> + 1 above, we would prefer to write
<em>x</em> &asymp; &frac12;<em>x</em> + 1.  The point is that
&lsquo;<em>x</em>&rsquo; here is a symbol, but whatever we take
symbols to be, it will almost never be the case that the symbol
<em>x</em> is identical to the expression &lsquo;&frac12;<em>x</em> +
1&rsquo; or to anything related to it.  For the solution to an
equation or a system of them, we will use a &ldquo;dagger&rdquo; to
refer to the solution.  Thus for this equation,
<em>x</em><sup>&dagger;</sup> = 2; the reason that 2 satisfies the
equation is that 2 =
&frac12;(2)+ 1 (and here we use = rather
than &asymp;).</p>
      

<p>
 Returning to equation
  (2), we take it to define streams
<em>x</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>, <em>y</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>, and
<em>z</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>.  These satisfy equations:
</p>

 <blockquote>
<table cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>
<em>x</em><sup>&dagger;</sup> = 
&lang;0,&thinsp;<em>y</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>&rang; 
 </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
<td></td>
<td>
 <em>y</em><sup>&dagger;</sup> = 
&lang;1,&thinsp;<em>z</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>&rang; 
 </td>
 </tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td>
<em>z</em><sup>&dagger;</sup> = 
&lang;2,&thinsp;<em>x</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>&rang; 
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
  These
streams then have unraveled forms.  For example, the unraveled form of
<em>y</em><sup>&dagger;</sup> is (1,2,0,1,2,0,&hellip;).</p>

<p>
 There is a natural operation of &ldquo;zipping&rdquo; two streams.
Also called &ldquo;merging&rdquo;, it is defined by</p>

<a name="zip"></a> 
<blockquote>
 <table cellpadding="3">
 <tr>
 <td>(3)</td>
 <td><font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>) = 
&lang;&thinsp;<font face="Arial">head</font>(s),
 <font face="Arial">zip</font>(t, 
 <font face="Arial">tail</font>(s))&thinsp;&rang; </td>
 </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 So to zip two streams <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> one starts with the
head of <em>s</em>, and then begins the same process of zipping all
over again, but this time with <em>t</em> first and the tail of
<em>s</em> second.  For example, if <em>x</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>,
<em>y</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>, and <em>z</em><sup>&dagger;</sup> are
the solutions to the system in equation (2) above, then we might wish to consider,
for example, 
<font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>x</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>,&thinsp;<em>y</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>). 
 In unraveled form, this is </p>

<blockquote>
 (0,1,1,2,2,0,0,1,1,2,2,0,&hellip;).
</blockquote>

<p>
 But please note that our definition of 
<font face="Arial">zip</font>
 does not work by recursion as one might expect; for one thing, there
are no &ldquo;base cases&rdquo; of streams.</p>

<p>
 We can even ask about solving systems of equations written in terms of 
<font face="Arial">zip</font>.
 It is easy to see that an equation like <em>x</em> =
<font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>x</em>, <em>x</em>)
 is satisfied by all and only the constant streams.  One like
 </p>

<blockquote>
 <em>x</em> =
<font face="Arial">zip</font>(<font face="Arial">head</font>(<em>x</em>) + 1, <em>x</em>)
 </blockquote>

<p>
 has no solutions whatsoever.  But if we do things right, we can
define very interesting streams.  For example, consider</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><em>x</em></td>
<td>&asymp;</td>
<td>
&lang;1,&thinsp; <font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>x</em>,&thinsp;<em>y</em>)&rang; </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><em>y</em></td> 
<td>&asymp;</td>
<td>
&lang;0,&thinsp;<font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>y</em>,&thinsp;<em>x</em>)&rang; </td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 The system has a unique solution.  The unraveled form of
<em>x</em><sup>&dagger;</sup> begins as</p>

<blockquote>
  (1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,&hellip;)
 </blockquote>

<p>
 that of <em>y</em><sup>&dagger;</sup> begins</p>

<blockquote>
 (0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,&hellip;).
</blockquote>

<p>
 The first of these is a famous sequence, the <em>Thue-Morse</em>
sequence <em>t</em> (actually <em>x</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>
= 
<font face="Arial">tail</font>(<em>t</em>).)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>

<h4><a name="1.1.1">1.1.1 The reduction of streams to functions</a></h4>

<p>
 We have been careful to emphasize the difference between streams as
we originally spoke of them and their unraveled form as functions on
the natural numbers.  At this point we want to look at this matter
more closely.</p>

<p>
 Before we turn to the details, let us consider the parallel matter of
<em>sequences</em> construed as functions on the natural numbers.
Anyone who teaches about (infinite) sequences of some sort, say
sequences of integers or real numbers, may at some point need to say
what a sequence actually is.  Surely this is not done very often in
elementary presentations: usually one would give examples instead of a
formal definition, or illustrate what sequences are for by using them
in some way or other.  In any case, it happens that in the usual
set-theoretic modeling of mathematics, sequences of real numbers would
be taken to <em>be</em> functions from the set of natural numbers to
the set of real numbers.  So we have a <em>reduction</em> of one kind
of object, sequences, to another, functions.  Of course, functions are
then reduced to sets of ordered pairs, ordered pairs to sets of a
certain form, natural numbers to sets of yet another form, and real
numbers in their own way.  Concerning this kind of reduction, we
should always ask whether it is necessary or silly, and whether it is
useful to those using the mathematical objects in the first place.
All of this is worth keeping in mind as we turn back to the sequences.</p>

<p>
 Let <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup> be the set of streams of natural
numbers, and let <sup><em>N</em></sup><em>N</em> be the set of
functions from <em>N</em> to <em>N</em>.  The reduction employs two
functions</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td>&phi;</td>
<td>:</td>
<td><em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup></td>
<td>&rarr;</td>
<td><sup><em>N</em></sup><em>N</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>&psi;</td>
<td>:</td>
<td><sup><em>N</em></sup><em>N</em></td>
<td>&rarr;</td>
<td><em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 defined as follows: For &phi;, we first take a stream <em>s</em> to a
function <em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>N</em>
&rarr; <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup>.  This time we use recursion:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td><em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(0)</td>
<td>=</td>
<td><em>s</em></td>

<tr>
<td><em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>n</em>+1)</td>
<td>=</td>
<td><font face="Arial">tail</font>(<em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>n</em>))</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 Then from <em>f</em> we get a function
&phi;(<em>s</em>)&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>N</em> &rarr; <em>N</em> by
<em>g</em>(<em>n</em>) =
<font face="Arial">head</font>(<em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>n</em>)).
 This defines &phi;, the precise definition of what we spoke of
earlier by the name <em>unraveling</em>.  In the other direction, we
need <em>infinite</em> systems of equations.  Given a function
<em>f</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>N</em> &rarr; <em>N</em>, consider</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td><em>x</em><sub>0</sub></td>

<td>&lang;<em>f</em>(0),&thinsp;<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>&rang; </td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>&hellip;</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 Then this system has a solution, and we take &psi;(<em>f</em>) =
<em>x</em><sub>0</sub><sup>&dagger;</sup>. It is then possible to show
that the composition in one direction, &psi; 
&sdot;
 &phi; ,
 is the identity on <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup> and the other composition
 &phi;
&sdot;
 &psi; is the identity on <sup><em>N</em></sup><em>N</em>.  In plainer
terms, we can pass from streams to functions on
numbers, and we can also go the other way.</p>

<p>
 At this point, we can ask questions about the reduction.  The
first question that comes to mind concerns the ontological status of
the entities:</p>

<blockquote>
 Let <em>A</em> be a collection of abstract objects (say functions
from natural numbers to natural numbers), and suppose that
one believes that the objects in <em>A</em> exist.  Let
<em>B</em> be a different collection of abstract objects.  Suppose
that <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> correspond in a natural way, and that
everything one says about objects in <em>B</em> could well be said
about their correspondents in <em>A</em>, perhaps using different
language.  Should one believe that the objects in <em>B</em> also
exist?
 </blockquote>

<p>
 Asking this about streams and functions on <em>N</em> is no different
than asking it for any other kind of reduction of mathematical
objects.  Any discussion of it would take us to issues in the
philosophy of mathematics that go beyond our goals in this entry.
However, there are two additional points to be made on this matter.</p>

<p>
 First, the standard modeling of pairs in set
 theory<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 would have us believe that from the beginning of this section
onwards, we have been talking about things which do not exist: as we
have literally defined them, there are no streams of numbers
whatsoever!  We discuss this at length in Section 2.2.1, when we talk
about the Foundation Axiom of set theory.  The point is is that this
axiom forbids object-level circularity in a way that precludes streams
in the exact form that we have them.  Thus if one wants to model the
intuitive notion of a stream as we have introduced it, one would need
to say something like: &ldquo;By a stream, we mean a function on
numbers.  We adopt special notation to make it look like streams are
pairs of a certain sort, but deep down they are just functions on
numbers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
 Continuing with questions about the reduction of streams to
functions, we can ask whether there is any conceptual difference using
streams as opposed to functions.  Certainly these represent different
points of view, and for this reason it should be useful to have both
available.  To see the difference, let us return to the matter of
zipping streams.  Done in terms of functions
<em>f</em>, <em>g</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>N</em> &rarr; <em>N</em>,
the zipped version would be</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td><font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>f</em>, <em>g</em>)(<em>n</em>)</td>
<td> = </td>
<td valign="middle"><font size="+4">{</font></td>
<td><em>f</em>(<em>n</em>/2) <br />
  <em>g</em>((<em>n</em>&minus;1)/2))</td>
<td>if <em>n</em> is even <br />
 if <em>n</em> is odd</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 It would be harder to use this to turn equation (4) into
the definition of two sequences by
 recursion.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-3" id="ref-3">3</a>]</sup>
 The upshot is that we can start to see some kind of difference when
we use one kind of representation instead of another.  And this brings
us to our second point on the reduction of streams to functions:
conceptual differences worth exploring may be hidden under the surface
of such a reduction.</p>

<p>
 At this point, we are done with our discussion of streams.  Of course
we shall revisit them in later sections to illustrate various points.
We also broadly foreshadow the main points of this entry:</p>

<ul> 

<li>By changing the usual axioms of set theory, one can model
circularly defined streams and other objects in a way which is closer
to the intuition that one has about them.  In particular, it is
possible to work with object-level circularity in a relatively
consistent set theory, and there may be reasons why one would want to
do so.</li>

<li>In the changed theory, we also find different results on
collections defined in terms of themselves.  We have already seen such
a collection, <em>HF</em> from (1).  The status of circular
definitions changes when one alters the set theory, and this leads to
a broader examination of several issues.</li>

<li>There is also a deeper conceptual issue going far beyond set
theory related to <em>top-down</em> vs. <em>bottom-up</em> treatments
of various phenomena.</li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="sectiontrees">1.2 Infinite trees</a></h3>

<p>
 We want to move from streams to a more complicated example, infinite
trees.  Some of the points that we make will be closely related to
what we have seen for streams, and some will raise new issues.</p>

<p>
 Here is a class of objects which we shall call
 <em>trees</em>:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-4" id="ref-4">4</a>]</sup></p>

<ol>
<li>The variables <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> alone are trees.</li>

<li>If <em>t</em> is a tree, then adding a single node labeled &bull;
as a new root with <em>t</em> as its only subtree gives a tree.</li>

<li>If <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> are trees, then adding a single node
labeled * as a new root with <em>s</em> as the left subtree and
<em>t</em> as the right subtree again gives a tree.</li>

<li>A tree is that which can be obtained by applying the operations any number of times (including infinite applications).</li>

</ol>

<p>
 Trees may be specified by <em>tree systems</em> (of equations).  Here
is one such system:</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="+7">
  <!--This is a table with one row and three cells, and each
      cell is a table, some of which have tables as cells. -->
      <tr> <td>(6)</td></tr>

  <table>
  <tr>
  <td><em>s</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  <td> &asymp; </td>

     <td><em>y</em></td>
     </tr>
     </table>
  </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
</td>
</tr>

</blockquote>
 
<p>
 Again, we use the &asymp; notation in variables for which we want to
solve, and we superscript variables with a dagger in the solution.  In
this case, the one and only solution of this system might be pictured
as</p>

<p>
 It will be useful to recast the definition of our trees in terms of
pairs and triples:</p>

<ol>

<li>The symbols <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> alone are trees.</li>

<li>If <em>t</em> is a tree, then
&lang;&bull;,&thinsp;<em>t</em>&rang; 
 is  a tree.</li>

<li>If <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> are trees, then
&lang;*,&thinsp;<em>s</em>,&thinsp;<em>t</em>&rang; 
 is a tree.</li>

<li>Trees may be &ldquo;infinitely deep&rdquo;.</li>

</ol>

<p>
 Then our system above is</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td><em>s</em></td>
<td> &asymp; </td>
<td>&lang;*,&thinsp;<em>t</em>,&thinsp;<em>u</em>&rang; </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>t</em></td>
<td> &asymp; </td>
<td>&lang;&bull;,&thinsp;<em>s</em>&rang; </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>u</em></td>
<td> &asymp; </td>
<td>&lang;*,&thinsp;<em>x</em>,&thinsp;<em>y</em>&rang; </td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 So now we have something that looks more like what we have seen with
streams.  But with streams we had an unraveled form, and so we might
wonder what the unraveled form of trees is.  To some extent, it would
be the pictures that we have already seen.  In particular, one could
take a tree as we have defined them and give a description of how one
would construct the picture.  (The full construction would take forever,
of course, but the same is true of our work on streams.)  Conversely,
given a picture, one could set down a tree system for it, where a
&ldquo;tree system&rdquo; is a system of equations as in equation (6).
(In general, the tree system would be infinite, but if you find a
<em>regular structure</em> in the picture, then the system could be
finite.)</p>

<p>
 On the other hand, pictures are not entirely respectable as standard
mathematical objects, despite the work that has gone on and continues
to go on to rehabilitate them.  For work on trees, one would need a
more complicated set of definitions.  We are not going to present any
of this.</p>

<p>
 <strong>More &lsquo;cheating&rsquo;</strong>. Let <em>Tr</em> be the
set of trees that we have been discussing.  Then our definition in
terms of <em>Tr</em> would have:</p>

<blockquote>
(7)&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Tr</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;
 {<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>} &cup; ({&bull;} &times; <em>Tr</em>) &cup;
  ({*} &times; <em>Tr</em> &times; <em>Tr</em>).
 </blockquote>

<p>
 Now again the standard modeling in set theory gives us a problem: one
can prove in <em>ZF</em> set theory that <em>Tr</em> has no solution whatsoever. 
And
this runs afoul of our pictures and intuition.  The standard way out
is to change the equals sign = in (7) to something else.  For most
mathematical work this is perfectly fine, but it is the kind of move
we explore in this entry.</p>

<h3><a name="1.3">1.3 Hypersets</a></h3>

<p>
 Let us turn from streams and trees to sets.  Before presenting some
analogs to what we have just seen, at <em>pictures of sets</em>.  To
make the discussion concrete, consider the set:</p>

<blockquote>
<em>x</em> = {&empty;,&thinsp;{{&empty;},&thinsp;&empty;}}
 </blockquote>

<p>
 Let us call this set <em>x</em>.  We want to draw a picture of this
set, so we start with a point which we think of as <em>x</em> itself.
Since <em>x</em> has two elements, we draw add two children:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><em>x</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><img src="swarrow.jpg" alt="southwest arrow" /></td>
<td></td>
<td><img src="searrow.jpg" alt="southeast arrow" /></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>y</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><em>z</em></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 Again, we draw arrows on behalf of the members.  We take <em>y</em>
to be &empty; and <em>z</em> to be {{&empty;},&thinsp;&empty;}.  We
do not add any children of <em>y</em> because it is empty.  But we
want to add two children to <em>z</em>, one for <em>w</em> =
{&empty;} and one for &empty;.  So we have</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><em>x</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><img src="swarrow.jpg" alt="southwest arrow" /></td>
<td></td>
<td><img src="searrow.jpg" alt="southeast arrow" /></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>y</em></td>
<td></td>
<td>&larr;</td>
<td></td>
<td><em>z</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>&darr;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><em>w</em></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 We conclude by putting an arrow from <em>w</em> to <em>y</em>, since
&empty; &isin; {&empty;}.</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><em>x</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><img src="swarrow.jpg" alt="southwest arrow" /></td>
<td></td>
<td><img src="searrow.jpg" alt="southeast arrow" /></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>y</em></td>
<td></td>
<td>&larr;</td>
<td></td>
<td><em>z</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><img src="nwarrow.jpg" alt="northwest arrow" /></td>
<td></td>
<td>&darr;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><em>w</em></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 Now we want to forget the identity of the nodes.  We could either
trade in the four sets that we used for numbers (to mention just one
way), or else finesse the issue entirely.  We would get one of the
pictures below:</p>

<blockquote>

 </table>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 Incidentally, in building this graph, we allowed ourselves to share
the node <em>y</em> both times we came to &empty;.  It would be
possible to avoid doing this, using different nodes.  The end result
would be a tree:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 A <em>graph</em> is a pair (<em>G</em>,&rarr;), where &rarr; is a
relation on <em>G</em> (a set of ordered pairs from <em>G</em>).  The
idea is that we want to think of a graphs as <em>notations for
sets</em>, just as systems of equations were notation for streams.
This is explained by the concept of a <em>decoration</em>: A
decoration <em>d</em> of a graph <em>G</em> is a function whose domain
is <em>G</em> and with the property that</p>

<blockquote>
 <em>d</em>(<em>g</em>) = {<em>d</em>(<em>h</em>)&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>g</em> 
 &rarr; <em>h</em>}.
 </blockquote>

<p>
 For example, let us introduce names for the nodes in the tree-like
graph and then find its decoration:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>1</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><img src="swarrow.jpg" alt="southwest arrow" /></td>
<td></td>
<td><img src="searrow.jpg" alt="southeast arrow" /></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>3</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td><img src="swarrow.jpg" alt="southwest arrow" /></td>
<td></td>
<td><img src="searrow.jpg" alt="southeast arrow" /></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>4</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>&darr;</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td>6</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 Since 6 has no children, <em>d</em>(6) must be &empty;.  Similarly,
<em>d</em>(5) and <em>d</em>(2) are also &empty;.  <em>d</em>(4) =
{<em>d</em>(6)} = {&empty;}.  <em>d</em>(3) =
{<em>d</em>(4),&thinsp;<em>d</em>(5)} =
{&thinsp;{&empty;},&thinsp;&empty;}.  And <em>d</em>(1) =
{<em>d</em>(2),&thinsp;<em>d</em>(3)} =
{&empty;,&thinsp;{&thinsp;{&empty;},&thinsp;&empty;}&thinsp;}.
Note this is the set <em>x</em> with which we started.  This is no
accident, and you are encouraged to think about why this is true.  A
related point: for a graph like the one in equation (8), where we use
the sets involved as the nodes of the graph, you should check that the
identity function is a decoration.</p>

<p>
 However, things get more interesting with an example like the loop
graph</p>

<blockquote>
 <table>
 <tr>
 <td align="center"><img src="loop.jpg" alt="loop" /><br /><em>x</em></td>

 Let <em>d</em> be a decoration of this graph.  Then we would have
<em>d</em>(<em>x</em>) = {<em>d</em>(<em>x</em>)}.  So writing &Omega;
for <em>d</em>(<em>x</em>), we have &Omega; = {&Omega;}.  This set
&Omega; is the most conspicuous example of object circularity: a set
that is a member of itself.  (Indeed, &Omega; is its own only
member.)</p>

<p>
 Finally, we want to consider an example that harks back to the stream
system (2) in Section 1.1.</p>

<a name="twelvepointgraph"></a>
<blockquote>
 <img src="graph1.jpg" alt="graph1" />
 </blockquote>

<p>
 Let us try to understand what a decoration <em>d</em> of this graph
would be.  In order to follow the discussion below, you should
remember from set theory that the standard rendering of the first few
natural numbers is by</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="+5">
<tr>
<td>0 = &empty;,</td> 
<td>1 = {&empty;},</td>
<td>2 = {0,1} = {&empty;, {&empty;}}</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 and also that the standard definition of the ordered pair 
&lang;<em>x</em>,&thinsp;<em>y</em>&rang; 
 is as {{<em>x</em>},{<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>}}.</p>

<p>
 Since <em>x</em><sub>0</sub> has no children,
<em>d</em>(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>) must be &empty;.  Then it follows
that <em>d</em>(<em>y</em><sub>0</sub>) =
{<em>d</em>(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>)} = {&empty;} = 1.  And now
</p>

<blockquote>
<em>d</em>(<em>z</em><sub>0</sub>) =
{<em>d</em>(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>),
<em>d</em>(<em>y</em><sub>0</sub>) } = {0,1} = 2.  
</blockquote>
 

<p>
 Furthermore,
<em>d</em>(<em>z</em><sub>1</sub>) = {2}.  It follows now that</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="+5">
<tr>
<td><em>d</em>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>) = {0},</td>
<td><em>d</em>(<em>y</em><sub>1</sub>) = {1},</td>
<td><em>d</em>(<em>z</em><sub>1</sub>) = {2}.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 And then </p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="+4">
<tr>
<td><em>d</em>(<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>)</td>
<td> = </td>
<td>{<em>d</em>(<em>y</em><sub>3</sub>),
 <em>d</em>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>)}</td>
<td> = </td>
<td>{{0, <em>d</em>(<em>y</em><sub>2</sub>)}, {0} }</td>
<td> = </td>
<td>&lang;0, <em>d</em>(<em>y</em><sub>2</sub>)&rang; </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>d</em>(<em>y</em><sub>2</sub>)</td>
<td> = </td>
<td>{<em>d</em>(<em>z</em><sub>3</sub>),
 <em>d</em>(<em>y</em><sub>1</sub>)}</td>
<td> = </td>
<td>{{1, <em>d</em>(<em>z</em><sub>2</sub>)}, {1} }</td>
<td> = </td>
<td>&lang;1,&thinsp;<em>d</em>(<em>z</em><sub>2</sub>)&rang; </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>d</em>(<em>z</em><sub>2</sub>)</td>
<td> = </td>
<td>{<em>d</em>(<em>x</em><sub>3</sub>),
 <em>d</em>(<em>z</em><sub>1</sub>)}</td>
<td> = </td>
<td>{{2, <em>d</em>(<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>)}, {2} }</td>
<td> = </td>
<td>&lang;2, <em>d</em>(<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>)&rang; </td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 The upshot is that we can go back to our original stream system in
equation (2) and then solve it by putting down our big graph and
decorating it.  The solution would be</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="+7">
<tr>
<td><em>x</em><sup>&dagger;</sup> = <em>d</em>(<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>),</td>
<td><em>y</em><sup>&dagger;</sup> = <em>d</em>(<em>y</em><sub>2</sub>),</td>
<td><em>z</em><sup>&dagger;</sup> = <em>d</em>(<em>z</em><sub>2</sub>).</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 A <em>hyperset</em> or <em>non-wellfounded set</em> is a set that is
obtained by decorating an arbitrary graph.</p>

<p>
 Another way of thinking about hypersets is in terms of <em>systems of
set equations</em>, as we have done it for streams and trees.  By such
a system we mean a set <em>X</em> which we think of as variables (any
set will do), and then a function <em>e</em> from <em>X</em> to its power set
 &weierp;<em>X</em>.
 That is, the value of <em>e</em> on each variable is again a set of
variables.  Set systems and related concepts correspond to ones for
graphs in the following way:</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1" cellpadding="+3">
<tr>
<td>the graph  (<em>G</em>,&rarr;)</td>
<td>the system of set equations (<em>X</em>, <em>e</em>)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>the nodes of <em>G</em></td>
<td>the set <em>X</em> of variables</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>the relation &rarr;  on the nodes</td>
<td>the function <em>e</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>X</em> 
 &rarr;
 &weierp;<em>X</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>the children of <em>x</em> in <em>G</em></td>
<td>the set <em>e</em>(<em>x</em>) &isin; 
 &weierp;<em>X</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>a decoration of the graph</td>
<td>a solution of the system</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 Every graph corresponds to a system of set equations, and vice-versa.
For example, corresponding to the picture in (9) we would take</p>

<p><em>X</em> = {<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,&thinsp;<em>y</em><sub>0</sub>,&thinsp;<em>z</em><sub>0</sub>,&thinsp;<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,&thinsp;<em>y</em><sub>1</sub>,&thinsp;<em>z</em><sub>1</sub>,&thinsp;<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>,&thinsp;<em>y</em><sub>2</sub>,&thinsp;<em>z</em><sub>2</sub>,&thinsp;<em>x</em><sub>3</sub>,&thinsp;<em>y</em><sub>3</sub>,&thinsp;<em>z</em><sub>3</sub>}</p>

<table cellpadding="+7">
<tr>
<td><em>e</em>(<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>) = &empty;</td>
<td nowrap="nowrap"><em>e</em>(<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>) = {<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>}</td>
<td nowrap="nowrap"><em>e</em>(<em>x</em><sub>2</sub>) = {<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,
 <em>y</em><sub>3</sub>}</td>
<td nowrap="nowrap"><em>e</em>(<em>x</em><sub>3</sub>) = {<em>z</em><sub>0</sub>,
 <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>}</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>e</em>(<em>y</em><sub>0</sub>) = {<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>}</td>
<td><em>e</em>(<em>y</em><sub>1</sub>) = {<em>y</em><sub>0</sub>}</td>
<td><em>e</em>(<em>y</em><sub>2</sub>) = {<em>y</em><sub>1</sub>,
 <em>z</em><sub>3</sub>}</td>
<td><em>e</em>(<em>y</em><sub>3</sub>) = {<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
 <em>y</em><sub>2</sub>}</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td nowrap="nowrap"><em>e</em>(<em>z</em><sub>0</sub>) = {<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
 <em>y</em><sub>0</sub>}</td>
<td><em>e</em>(<em>z</em><sub>1</sub>) = {<em>z</em><sub>0</sub>}</td>
<td><em>e</em>(<em>z</em><sub>2</sub>) = {<em>z</em><sub>1</sub>,
 <em>x</em><sub>3</sub>}</td>
<td><em>e</em>(<em>z</em><sub>3</sub>) = {<em>y</em><sub>0</sub>,
 <em>z</em><sub>2</sub>}</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
 So the way to go from the picture to the function is that each
set <em>e</em>(<em>v</em>) is the set of children of <em>v</em>.
In terms of the kind of notation we have seen before, we prefer to
write this system in a way that elides <em>e</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="+5">
<tr>
<td><em>x</em><sub>0</sub> &asymp; &empty;</td>
<td><em>x</em><sub>1</sub> &asymp; {<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>}</td>
<td><em>x</em><sub>2</sub> &asymp; {<em>x</em><sub>1</sub>,
 <em>y</em><sub>3</sub>}</td>
<td><em>x</em><sub>3</sub> &asymp; {<em>z</em><sub>0</sub>,
 <em>x</em><sub>2</sub>}</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>y</em><sub>0</sub> &asymp; {<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>}</td>
<td><em>y</em><sub>1</sub> &asymp; {<em>y</em><sub>0</sub>}</td>
<td><em>y</em><sub>2</sub> &asymp; {<em>y</em><sub>1</sub>,
 <em>z</em><sub>3</sub>}</td>
<td><em>y</em><sub>3</sub> &asymp; {<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
 <em>y</em><sub>2</sub>}</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>z</em><sub>0</sub> &asymp; {<em>x</em><sub>0</sub>,
 <em>y</em><sub>0</sub>}</td>
<td><em>z</em><sub>1</sub> &asymp; {<em>z</em><sub>0</sub>}</td>
<td><em>z</em><sub>2</sub> &asymp; {<em>z</em><sub>1</sub>,
 <em>x</em><sub>3</sub>}</td>
<td><em>z</em><sub>3</sub> &asymp; {<em>y</em><sub>0</sub>,
 <em>z</em><sub>2</sub>}</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 The study of non-wellfounded sets proposes to treat <em>every</em>
graph as a picture of a unique set.  In order to make this work, some
kind of change is needed in set theory.  The reason is that sets like
&Omega; = {&Omega;} do not exist in the most commonly-used set theory,
<em>ZFC</em>.  This is due to the Foundation Axiom (<em>FA</em>):
we&rsquo;ll discuss this issue further in Section 2 below.  For now,
<em>FA</em> implies that the only graphs with decorations are those
with no infinite sequence of points following the arrows.  The change
in set theory that we make is simply to replace this axiom <em>FA</em>
with a different one called <em>AFA</em>.  The content of <em>AFA</em>
is that every graph has a unique decoration (alternatively, every
system of set equations has a unique solution).</p>

<p>
 At the same time, there is a reduction of hypersets to ordinary sets.
This means that one could regard all talk of hypersets as merely
abbreviatory.  This reduction is fairly complicated, and we shall
present it in due course.</p>
 
<p>
 Adopting <em>AFA</em> not only helps with circularly defined sets,
but it also helps with streams and trees.  As we have mentioned, if
one uses <em>FA</em>, there are no streams or trees according to our
definitions.  That is, <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup> is literally the
empty set with <em>FA</em>, as is <em>Tr</em>.  But with <em>AFA</em>
these sets are non-empty.  Moreover, one can prove that under
<em>AFA</em>, <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup> and <em>Tr</em> have the
properties that one would want them to have.  (For example, one can
prove that <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup> corresponds to the function
space <sup><em>N</em></sup><em>N</em> in the way we have discussed.)
Finally, working out the resulting theory gives tools that are useful
in studying collections of circularly-defined objects such as streams
and trees.  The point is that this one axiom <em>AFA</em> gives us all
of this, and more.</p>

<h4><a name="1.3.1">1.3.1 Terminology and history</a></h4>

<p>
 The Axiom <em>AFA</em> was first studied by Marco Forti and Furio
Honsell in 1983. Their paper (Forti and Honsell 1983) studies a number
of axioms which contradict the Foundation Axiom <em>FA</em>,
continuing a much older line of work in set theory that deals with
alternatives to <em>FA</em>.  The one they call <em>X</em><sub>1</sub>
is equivalent to what has now come to be called <em>AFA</em>.</p>

<p>
 Peter Aczel&rsquo;s book (1988) treats many axioms that contradict
<em>FA</em>, but it pays most attention to <em>AFA</em>.  It also
proved many of the important results in the subject, including ones
mentioned in this entry.  Aczel&rsquo;s own entrance to the subject was an
area of semantic modeling that he had been working on, concerning the
calculus of communicating systems (CCS).  He found it natural to
propose a set theoretic semantics, and yet the most obvious modeling
seemed to run into problems with Foundation.  It is always a bold step
to recommend changing the axioms of set theory in order to make an
application of the subject.  Usually it is a brash move.  For the most
part people resist the idea: when the proposal might well be cast in
more standard forms (as can be done with work using <em>AFA</em>),
people wonder why one wants to tamper with a standard theory; when it
cannot be cast in a standard way, the reception is even worse.</p>

<p>
 Aczel&rsquo;s work became influential for two research areas.  He visited
Stanford in 1985, where Jon Barwise was director of the Center for the
Study of Language and Information (and this author was a post-doc
there).  Barwise recognized the value of the work, partly because he
had similar problems with Foundation in his own work on situation
semantics, and partly because he saw in the work an appealing
conception of set that was at odds with the iterative conception that
had been received wisdom for him and
practically everyone else raised in the mainstream tradition
of mathematical 
 logic.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-5" id="ref-5">5</a>]</sup>
 He thought that <em>non-wellfounded sets</em> should be called by a
name that reflected the change in conception, and he proposed calling
them <em>hypersets</em> in parallel to the <em>hyperreal</em> numbers
of non-standard analysis.  This terminology has for the most part not
stuck, but it is not completely outdated, either.  In this entry,
we&rsquo;ll use both terms interchangeably.</p>

<p>
Perhaps the first serious application of the tools we are studying 
in this entry comes from this period.   This is Barwise and Etchemendy&rsquo;s
book <em>The Liar</em> (Barwise and Etchemendy 1987).   
Its proposals are contributions to the theory of truth.   Since we are not
primarily interested in those applications of hypersets, we resist the temptation
to discuss matters further.   
</p>

<p>
 Aczel&rsquo;s book was also immediately influential for people working on
semantic questions in theoretical computer science.  This was not so
much because it raised questions about set theory, but rather because
it showed the value of using the categorical notion of a
<em>coalgebra</em>.  The main use in the book is to organize certain
concepts into an elegant subject.  But it quickly became apparent that
this notion of coalgebra could be studied on its own, that themes from
the book had a field of application much wider than pure set
theory.</p>

<p>
 This entry reflects the influence of all of these sources.  To be
sure, we shall see the main results on the set theory obtained using
<em>AFA</em>.  Also, we present enough of the theory that someone who
needs to read papers that use it should be able to do start doing so.
We also emphasize the conceptual underpinnings of the subject, and
compare them to more standard foundational work.  This is hardly ever
done in technical papers on the subject, but should be of interest to
people in several areas of philosophy.  Finally, our work incorporates
many ideas and results coming from the coalgebra research community in
the years following the publication of Aczel 1988.</p>

<p>
 We conclude this section with links to the two following
supplementary documents:</p>

<blockquote>
 <a href="harsanyi-type-spaces.html">Universal Harsanyi Type Spaces</a> 
 <br />
 <a href="self-similar-sets.html">Self-similar Sets of Real Numbers</a>  
 </blockquote>

<p>
 These contain introductory points on two issues that we shall revisit
 (again, in supplementary documents)
 at the end of this entry.    The reason for the separation is that 
 the issues discussed pertain to game theory and measure theory
 on the one hand, and fractals and metric spaces on the other.
 That is, the discussions are not entirely set theoretic.  
 In addition, the mathematical prerequisites for all our supplements are
  greater than for the main body of this entry.
  They may be omitted without losing the main thread.
However, we emphasize
 that the  overall theory presented in this entry does treat all of these
 instances of circularity &ldquo;under the same roof.&rdquo;
 </p>

<h2><a name="2">2. The Foundation and Anti-Foundation Axioms</a></h2>

<p>

The set theoretic side of our story is connected to two axioms, the
<em>Foundation Axiom</em> and the <em>Anti-Foundation Axiom</em>.  We
present them here, and discuss some related conceptions of set.</p>

<h3><a name="2.1">2.1 Background from set theory</a></h3>

<p>
We start with a reminder of a few basic facts of set theory.  One can
find more in any textbook on the subject, and also the entry on
  <a href="../set-theory/index.html"> set theory</a>, especially in its
supplementary document 
  <a href="../set-theory/basic-set-theory.html">basic set theory</a>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Power sets</strong>.
For any set <em>s</em>, the power set of <em>s</em> is the set of subsets of <em>s</em>.
We write this set as &weierp;(<em>s</em>)
or just as &weierp;<em>s</em>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Pairing</strong>.
The Kuratowski ordered pair  
&lang;a,b&rang; 
 of two sets <em>a</em> and 
 <em>b</em> is {{<em>a</em>}, {<em>a,b</em>}}.
<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-6" id="ref-6">6</a>]</sup>
The standard presentation of
set theory defines and studies relations, functions, and the like
in terms of this pairing operation.
All  mathematical facts  about these notions can then be proved in set theory.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Natural numbers</strong>.  One also defines versions of the
natural numbers by: 0 = &empty;, 1 = {&empty;}, etc.  Again, all facts
about numbers and functions on them can be proved in set theory.  In
fact, essentially all mathematical facts whatsoever can be stated
formally and proved in set theory.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Union and transitive closure</strong>.
For any set <em>a</em>,   <font size="+1">&cup;</font><em>a</em>
 is the set of elements of elements of <em>a</em>.
A set is <em>transitive</em> if every element of it is also a subset of it.
The <em>transitive closure</em> of  <em>a</em> is 
</p>

<blockquote>
<em>a</em> &cup;   <font size="+1">&cup;</font><em>a</em>
&cup;
  <font size="+1">&cup;&cup;</font><em>a</em> &hellip;.
</blockquote>

<p>  
This set is denoted <em>tc(a)</em>.   It is the smallest transitive set which 
includes <em>a</em> as a subset.
</p>

<a name="Cantor"></a>
<blockquote>
 <strong>Theorem [Cantor]</strong>.
  For all sets <em>s</em>, and all functions 
  <em>f</em> &thinsp; : <em>s</em> &rarr; 
              &weierp;<em>s</em>,
<em>f</em> is not surjective.  In fact,
{<em>x</em>&thinsp;&isin;&thinsp;<em>s</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;x&thinsp;&notin;&thinsp;
 <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)} is not in the image
set <em>f</em>&thinsp;[<em>s</em>].  (Here, the image
set <i>f</i>[<i>s</i>] =
{<i>f</i>(<i>x</i>)&thinsp;:&thinsp;<i>x</i>&thinsp;&isin;&thinsp;<i>s</i>}.)
</blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<p><strong>Proof</strong>.
Let <em>c</em> = {<em>x</em> 
    &thinsp;&isin;&thinsp; <em>s</em>: <em>x</em>&thinsp;&notin;&thinsp; <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)}.   
Suppose towards a contradiction that  <em>c</em>&thinsp;&isin;&thinsp;
     <em>f</em>[<em>s</em>].
  Fix  <em>a</em>  &thinsp;&isin;&thinsp;   <em> s</em>
   such that <em>c</em> =   <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>).
Then <em>a</em> &isin;  <em>c</em> iff 
<em>a</em> &notin; 
<em>f</em>(<em>a</em>)  iff 
<em>a</em>  &notin;  <em>c</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
 <strong>Corollary</strong>.
  For all sets <em>s</em>, &weierp;<em>s</em>
   is not a subset of <em>s</em>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<p>
<strong>Proof</strong>.
 If   &weierp;<em>s</em> &sube;
 <em>s</em>, 
we construct a function <em>f</em> from <em>s</em> onto 
&weierp;<em>s</em>:  
let <em>f</em>f(<em>f</em>) =
<em>a</em>
if  <em>a</em> &isin; <em>s</em>, and otherwise let 
<em>f</em>f(<em>f</em>) = &empty;.
So we cannot have  &weierp; <em>s</em> &sube;
<em>s</em>,  lest we contradict 
<a href="#Cantor">Cantor&rsquo;s Theorem</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<strong>Corollary[Russell&rsquo;s Paradox].</strong>. 
There is no set <em>R</em>
 such that every set belongs to <em>R</em>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote> 
<strong>Proof</strong>.
Such a set would have &weierp;<em>s</em> &sube;
  <em>R</em>
 for all sets <em>s</em>
In particular &weierp; <em>R</em> &sube;
  <em>R</em>, contradicting our last result.
</blockquote>

<p>
We call the last result <em>Russell&rsquo;s Paradox</em> in view of
its content.  Neither our statement nor our proof are the most
standard ones.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers</strong>.
We need the concept of ordinal numbers at a few places.
</p>

<p>
A <em>well-ordered set</em> is a pair <em>W</em> = (<em>W</em>, &lt;),
 where &lt; is a relation on  the set <em>W</em>
which is a strict linear order and with the property that every non-empty subset of
<em>W</em> has a &lt;-least element.  For example, (<em>N</em>, &lt; )
is a well-order, where &lt; is given by
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>  
0    &lt; 2   &lt;  4 &lt;  &hellip;  1  &lt;    3  &lt; 5 &lt;    &hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One can show using the Replacement Axiom that every well-ordered set <em>W</em>
has a unique decoration <em>d</em>.   An <em>ordinal number</em>
(or <em>ordinal</em>)  is a set of the form
<em>d(<em>w</em>)</em>, for some well-ordered set 
(<em>W</em>,&lt; ) and some <em>w</em> &isin; <em>W</em>.
</p>

<p>
One usually uses Greek letters such as &alpha; and &beta; for ordinal numbers,
and one also writes &alpha; &lt;  &beta;  if &alpha; &isin; &beta;.   There are a number of
standard facts about ordinal numbers, including the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li> If &alpha; is an ordinal, so is &alpha; &cup; {&alpha;}.
</li>
<li> The standard modeling 
of natural numbers renders them as ordinals,
and the set  &omega; of natural numbers is also an ordinal.
</li>
<li> The collection of ordinal numbers is not a set.  
</li>
<li>  Except for not being a set, the ordinal numbers with &lt; 
has all the properties of a well-ordered set.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
An ordinal &alpha;  is a <em>successor ordinal</em> if 
&alpha; = &beta; &cup; {&beta;} for some (other) ordinal &beta;.
Ordinals which are neither 0 nor
successor ordinals are called <em>limit ordinals</em>.   The smallest
limit ordinal is  &omega;; it is  <em>d</em>(1) for the well-order we saw above,
0    &lt; 2   &lt;  4 &lt;  &hellip;  1  &lt;    3  &lt; 5 &lt;    &hellip;
</p>

<p>
<strong>The cumulative hierarchy</strong>.
There is a unique operation 
 taking ordinals &alpha;  to 
sets  <em>V</em><sub>&alpha;</sub> such that
</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="+3">
<tr>
<td align="center"><em>V</em><sub>0</sub></td>
<td>=</td>
<td>&empty;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>V</em><sub>&alpha;+1</sub></td>
<td>=</td>
<td>&weierp;<em>V</em><sub>&alpha;</sub></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td align="center"><em>V</em><sub>&lambda;</sub></td>
<td>=</td>
<td><font size="+1">&cup;</font><sub>&beta;&lt;&lambda;</sub>
    <em>V</em><sub>&beta;</sub> for &lambda; a limit ordinal </td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>The <em>ZFC</em> axioms</strong>.
We are not going to state them here, but see 
the  entry on  <a href="../set-theory/index.html">set theory</a>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Classes</strong>.
The axioms of set theory are not about sets as much as they are about 
the <em>universe of sets</em>.     One of the intuitive
principles of the theory is that arbitrary collections of mathematical objects
&ldquo;should be&rdquo; sets.    Due to paradoxes, this intuitive principle is not directly formalized
in standard set theories.  In a sense, the axioms one does have are intended to 
give enough sets to constitute a mathematical universe while not having so many
as to risk inconsistency.   But   
it is natural in this connection to consider some collections of objects which
are demonstrably not sets.  These are called <em>proper classes</em>.  The
term <em>class</em> informally refers to a collection of mathematical objects.  
Classes are usually not first-class objects in set theory.  (Certainly they are not
in the most standard set theory, <em>ZFC</em>.   However, 
the SEP entry
 on  <a href="../settheory-alternative/index.html">Alternative Axiomatic Set Theories</a>
 does 
mention quite a few theories which treat classes as first-class objects.) 
Instead, a statement about classes
is  regarded as a paraphrase for some other (more complicated and usually less
intuitive) statement about sets.    This is probably not a good place to discuss
the details of the formalization; one 
useful source is Chapter 1 of Azriel Levy (1979).
</p>

<p>
 For our purposes, classes may be taken as 
 <em>definable subcollections
of the universe of sets</em>.   For example, if 
<em>a</em>  is any set, then the class of
 all sets which do not contain
<em>a</em>   as an element is {<em>x</em> :<em>a</em>  &notin; <em>x</em>}.  
In  specifying a class, one may use the first-order language with the 
membership symbol and the rest of the syntax from logic, and one may 
also use particular sets as parameters, as we have just done.
</p>

<p>
The class <em>V</em> of all sets is  {<em>x</em> : <em>x</em>   = <em>x</em>}.
The definability here is in the first-order logic with just a symbol &isin; for membership,
and the quantifiers range over sets (not classes).
Another class of interest is <em>WF</em>, the class of all well-founded sets.
This is the same as   <font size="+1">&cup;</font><sub>&alpha;</sub>
<em>V<sub>&alpha;</sub></em>, the sets that belong to
<em>V<sub>&alpha;</sub></em> for  some ordinal &alpha;.
</p>

<p>
If <em>C</em> is a class, we define 
the <em>power class of C</em>, &weierp;<em>C</em>,
by 
</p>

<blockquote>
&weierp;<em>C</em>
 =  {<em>x</em> : for all <em>y</em>, 
 if <em>y</em> &isin; <em>x</em>, then &phi;<sub><em>C</em></sub>(y)},
</blockquote>

<p>
where  &phi;<sub><em>C</em></sub> 
is the formula that defines the class <em>C</em>.
It is important that in this definition <em>x</em> ranges over <em>sets</em> and not classes;
the formal language used does not directly talk about classes in the first place.
For example, &weierp;<em>V</em> = <em>V</em>,
 and &weierp;(<em>WF</em>) = <em>WF</em>.
We also define the action of other operations on classes in the same general way.
For example, the finite power set &weierp;<sub>fin</sub>
 takes a class <em>C</em> to the class of
finite subsets of  <em>C</em>.
</p>

<h3><a name="2.2">2.2 The Foundation Axiom</a></h3>

<p>
The Foundation Axiom (<em>FA</em>)
may be stated in different ways. 
   Here are some formulations;
their equivalence in the presence of the other axioms
 is a standard result of elementary set theory.
</p>

<ol>

<li>Let <em>a</em> be any set, and let 
<em>f</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;&weierp;<em>a</em> &rarr; <em>a</em>.
Let <em>b</em> be any transitive set.  Then there is a unique function
<em>g</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>b</em> &rarr; <em>a</em> so that for
all <em>x</em> &isin; <em>b</em>,
<em>g</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>g</em>[<em>x</em>]).
</li>

<li>For every set <em>x</em>, there is an ordinal number &alpha;  such that 
<em>x</em> &isin; <em>V</em><sub>&alpha;</sub>.</li>

<li><em>V</em> = <em>WF</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first of these is probably the easiest to remember and think about.
The second is important because it is the one most easily expressed in first-order
logic.   The third is a recursion principle; we shall consider a closely related 
principle in
<a href="#4.4">Section 4.4</a>.

</p>

<h4><a name="2.2.1">2.2.1 The iterative conception of set</a></h4>

<p>
As we have seen, one formulation of <em>FA</em> says that every set belongs
to some <em>V</em><sub>&alpha;</sub>.  This is a mathematical formulation of the
<em>iterative concept of set</em>: sets are just what one gets by
iterating the power set operation on the well-ordered class of ordinal
numbers.  We start with nothing, the empty set.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-7" id="ref-7">7</a>]</sup>
This is <em>V</em><sub>0</sub>.  Then we form 
<em>V</em><sub>1</sub> = 
&weierp;<em>V</em><sub>0</sub>.
  Then 
<em>V</em><sub>2</sub> = 
&weierp;<em>V</em><sub>1</sub>.
Going on, when we come to the first limit ordinal &omega;, we take 
<em>V</em><sub>&omega;</sub>
to be 
the union of all the sets
<em>V</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>.  
  Then we proceed to
<em>V</em><sub>&omega;+ 1</sub>
 = &weierp; <em>V</em><sub>&omega;</sub>.
  We continue like this absolutely
forever, going through &ldquo;all the ordinal numbers&rdquo;.  The collection so
described is the universe <em>V</em> of sets.
</p>

<p>
This way of describing the iterative picture suggests that the ordinal numbers
were somehow present  &ldquo;before&rdquo; all the iteration takes place, or at least
that they have a life apart from the rest of the sets.   There is a different way
of understanding the iterative conception, one that emphasizes the 
harmony between the iteration of the power set operation and the Replacement Axiom:
as one iterates the power set axiom, more and more well-ordered sets appear.
Replacement allows us to decorate these well-ordered sets, creating new ordinals
in the process.  Thus the whole picture is one of balance.
Indeed, this point about balance can be phrased without reference to any
&ldquo;iteration&rdquo; at all: there is an equilibrium in the set theoretic universe
between the &ldquo;sideways&rdquo; push of the Power Set Axiom and the 
&ldquo;upward&rdquo; push of the Replacement
Axiom.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-8" id="ref-8">8</a>]</sup>
</p>

<p>
<strong>Using the Foundation Axiom</strong>.
<em>FA</em> plays no role in the formalization of mathematics or in the study of infinity.
It is an &ldquo;optional extra&rdquo;  for mathematics.   <em>FA</em> is used
to clarify our picture of sets, just as we have described.  This often comes 
with an implicit argument of roughly the following shape:
</p>

<p>
<strong>An argument</strong>.
One is tempted to justify <em>FA</em> along the following lines:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Russell&rsquo;s Paradox shows that there is no set of all sets:
the class <em>V</em> cannot be a member of itself.
</li>

<li>The iterative picture shows why <em>no</em> set can be a
member of itself.
</li>

<li>The iterative picture also suggests <em>FA</em> in the form that every
set belongs to some <em>V</em><sub>&alpha;</sub>.
</li>

<li>Thus <em>FA</em> reflects a picture which avoids Russell&rsquo;s Paradox,
hence it is sensible to accept it.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
The rejoinder here is that there might be other intuitive pictures
or conceptions of sets
 that also explain, or draw lessons from, the paradoxes.   So they 
 would be as sensible as <em>FA</em> in this regard.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Since <em>FA</em> plays a conceptual role but no mathematical role,
 it is not surprising that there are widely different views on 
 whether it is an important part of standard set theory <em>ZFC</em> or not.
 For a collection of quotes on the role of <em>FA</em>, see
 Barwise and Moss (1991).
</p>

 <p>
<strong>The Foundation Axiom and object circularity</strong>.
We mentioned in connection with streams that according to standard set theory,
streams of numbers do not exist.   Here is the reasoning.
Recall that we defined a stream to be a pair of a number and another stream.
  Suppose that a stream
<em>s</em> exists, so that the set <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup>
of streams is non-empty.
  Recall that we have a function  
<em>f<sub>s</sub></em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>N</em> &rarr; <em>N<sup>&infin;</sup></em> 
 by recursion:
 </p>
 
<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td><em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(0)</td>
<td>=</td>
<td><em>s</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>n</em>+1)</td>
<td>=</td>
<td><font face="Arial">tail</font>(<em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>n</em>))</td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
To save on some notation at this point, let&rsquo;s write <em>h<sub>n</sub></em> for 
<font face="Arial">head</font>(<em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>n</em>))
and 
<em>t<sub>n</sub></em>
for
<font face="Arial">tail</font>(<em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>n</em>)).
For all <em>n</em>,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
 <em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>n</em>)  = 
&lang;&thinsp;<em>h<sub>n</sub></em>, <em>t<sub>n</sub></em>&thinsp;&rang; 
 = 
 {{<em>h<sub>n</sub></em>},  {{<em>h<sub>n</sub></em>, <em>t<sub>n</sub></em>}}}; 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
this is true of any pair whatsoever.
Notice that 
</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>
<em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>n</em>+1) 
=  <em>t<sub>n</sub></em>
&isin;
{<em>h<sub>n</sub></em>, <em>t<sub>n</sub></em>}
&isin;
<em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>n</em>).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So we have
</p>

<blockquote> 
<p>
<em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>0</em>)
&ni;
{<em>h<sub>0</sub></em>, <em>t<sub>0</sub></em>}
&ni;
<em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>1</em>)
&ni;
{<em>h<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>t<sub>1</sub></em>}
&ni;
<em>f</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(<em>2</em>)
&ni;
&hellip;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is a descending sequence in the membership relation, something forbidden by <em>FA</em>.
</p>

<p>
The same kind of remark applies to infinite trees as we discussed them,
and certainly to hypersets.    The conclusion is that if one wants to work with such objects
in a set theory with <em>FA</em>, then one must do so indirectly.    
</p>

<h3><a name="2.3">2.3 The Anti-Foundation Axiom</a></h3>

<p>
The Anti-Foundation Axiom <em>AFA</em> is stated as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
 Every graph has a unique decoration.
</blockquote>

<p>
The theory <em>ZFA</em> is <em>ZFC</em> with <em>FA</em>  replaced by <em>AFA</em>.
It includes the Axiom of Choice, even though there is no &ldquo;<em>C</em>&rdquo; in the 
acronym.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The coiterative conception of set</strong>.
<em>AFA</em> gives rise to, or reflects, a conception of set that is at odds
with the iterative conception.   For lack of a better name, we call it
the <em>coiterative conception</em>.    According to this, a set is an abstract
structure obtained by taking a graph <em>G</em> 
(a set with a relation  on it),
and then associating to each node <em>x</em> in the graph a set in such a way that
the set associated to <em>x</em> is the set of sets associated to the children of <em>x</em>
in <em>G</em> .    This association is what we called <em>decoration</em> earlier.
 This association might be thought of procedurally, but it need not be
so construed.   One can instead posit a harmony between decoration
and power sets.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
<strong>What changes with <em>AFA</em>, and what does not change?</strong>.  
 <em>AFA</em> gives us unique solutions to systems of set systems;
this is almost immediate from the axiom and the close relation of set systems
and graphs.    But it also gives us unique solutions for stream systems and tree systems.
The details of this are suggested by our work on the decoration of 
<a href="#twelvepointgraph"> the graph related to streams and pairs</a> which we saw
earlier on.
</p>

<p>
All of the results in set theory which
do not use <em>FA</em> go through when one replaces it by <em>AFA</em>.  In particular, 
the following topics are unchanged: Russell&rsquo;s Paradox  and the Separation
(Subset) Axioms;
the modeling of ordered pairs, relations and functions; 
the natural numbers, real numbers, etc.;  well-orderings and the ordinal numbers;
transfinite recursion on well-orders and well-founded relations;
the Axiom of Choice; problems and results concerning the sizes of infinite sets.
The only difference would be in modeling questions for circularly defined objects of various
sorts,
as we have been discussing
them.    
</p>

<p>
In terms of modeling circularity, <em>AFA</em> gives several new concepts
and techniques.   These are described in our next section.
</p>

<h2><a name="3">3. Using <em>AFA</em></a></h2>

<p>
This section offers
a quick introduction to the central parts of the theory
non-wellfounded sets: what one would need to know to use
the theory and to read papers on it.
</p>

<h3><a name="3.1">3.1 Bisimulation</a></h3>

<p>
The topic of <em>bisimulation</em> is one of the earliest goals in a
treatment of non-wellfounded sets.
</p>

<p>
 Let (<em>G</em>,&rarr;) be a graph.
 A relation <em>R</em> on
<em>G</em> is a <em>bisimulation</em> if the following holds:
whenever <em>x</em>&thinsp;<em>R</em>&thinsp;<em>y</em>, 
</p>

<ol>
<li>If <em>x</em> &rarr; <em>x</em>&prime;, then there is some 
<em>y</em> &rarr; <em>y</em>&prime;
such that  <em>x</em>&prime;&thinsp;<em>R</em>&thinsp;<em>y</em>&prime;.
</li>

<li>
 If  <em>y</em> &rarr; <em>y</em>&prime;, 
 then there is some <em>x</em> &rarr; <em>x</em>&prime;
 such that  <em>x</em>&prime;&thinsp;<em>R</em>&thinsp;<em>y</em>&prime;.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
These are sometimes called by the suggestive names
<em>zig</em> and <em>zag</em>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Bisimulation between graphs</strong>.
Before giving examples, we should clarify some usage.
At a few points, we&rsquo;ll speak of bisimulation <em>between</em> two graphs
<em>G</em> and <em>H</em>, rather than <em>on</em> a single graph.
   This can be defined in the same general way.    Note also that one can
   take the <em>disjoint union</em> <em>G</em> + <em>H</em>
    of the graphs <em>G</em> and <em>H</em>, and then 
   a bisimulation between <em>G</em> and <em>H</em> would be a 
bisimulation on <em>G</em> + <em>H</em>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Returning to bisimulation on a graph</strong>.
 For an example, let&rsquo;s look at the following graph <em>G</em>:
</p>
 
 <blockquote>
 <img src="fig1.png" width="325" alt="fig1" />
 </blockquote>
 

<p>
All of the  3-points have no children. 
(Point <em>3d</em> is not reached from any other point, but
the arrows <em>into</em> a node are of no interest.)
   So every relation which
only relates <em>3</em>-points is a bisimulation  on <em>G</em>.
Concretely, 
</p>

<blockquote>
{(3<em>a</em>, 3<em>b</em>), (3<em>c</em>, 3<em>a</em>), (3<em>d</em>, 3<em>d</em>)}
</blockquote>

<p>
is easily seen to be a bisimulation.
</p>

<p>
For that matter, the empty relation is also a bisimulation on <em>G</em>.
</p>

<p>
Another bisimulation is
</p>

<blockquote>{(2<em>a</em>, 2<em>b</em>), 
(2<em>b</em>, 2<em>c</em>), (2<em>c</em>, 2<em>a</em>),
 (3<em>a</em>, 3<em>b</em>), 
 (3<em>b</em>, 3<em>c</em>), (3<em>c</em>, 3<em>a</em>)}. 
</blockquote>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s call this relation <em>R</em>.
It would take a lot of checking to actually verify
that <em>R</em> is a bisimulation.
Here is just two items of it:  We see that  2<em>b</em>&thinsp;<em>R</em>&thinsp;2<em>c</em>.
Now  2<em>c</em> &rarr; 2<em>b</em>.  
Thus we need some node
<em>x</em> so that <em>x</em>&thinsp;<em>R</em>&thinsp;2<em>b</em>
 and  2<em>b</em> &rarr; <em>x</em>.
For this, we take  2<em>a</em>.     For our second point 
of verification, again note that 
 2<em>b</em>&thinsp;<em>R</em>&thinsp; 2<em>c</em> .   Since 
 2<em>b</em> &rarr;  3<em>b</em>, we need some
 node <em>x</em> so that  2<em>c</em> &rarr; <em>x</em> and  3<em>b</em>
 &thinsp;<em>R</em>&thinsp;
 <em>x</em>.
 We take 
 <em>x</em> = 3<em>c</em> for this.
</p>

 

<p>
 The largest bisimulation on our graph <em>G</em> is the 
 relation that relates
1
  to itself, all 2-points to
 all 2-points, and all 3-points
  to all 3-points.
 Note that this is an equivalence relation:
 reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
 This is not an accident.
</p> 
 
 
<blockquote>
 <strong>Proposition</strong>  For any graph <em>H</em>, there is a largest
 bisimulation on   <em>H</em>.    This relation is
 an equivalence relation denoted  &equiv;<sub><em>b</em></sub>, 
  and it is  characterized by
<blockquote>
<em>x</em>  &equiv;<sub><em>b</em></sub>
<em>y</em> 
iff  there is a bisimulation on
 <em>H</em> 
  relating <em>x</em> to <em>y</em>.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p> This relation   &equiv;<sub><em>b</em></sub>  is
called  <em>bisimilarity</em>.
</p>
 
 <p>
We can always form the <em>quotient graph</em> 
 using the largest bisimulation.
Here is how this works, using <em>G</em>
 from above
as an example.    In  <em>G</em>/&equiv;<sub><em>b</em></sub>,
we would have three nodes, corresponding to the
three  equivalence classes under the largest bisimulation;
 let&rsquo;s call these  classes 
 <em>1</em>, <em>2</em> and <em>3</em>.   We put an arrow between
 two of these  classes if some (every) element of the first has an
 arrow to some element of the second.    In this way, we 
 construct the quotient.  
 Here is a picture of  <em>G</em>
 again, along with its 
 quotient  <em>G</em>/&equiv;<sub><em>b</em></sub>
under the largest bisimulation:
</p>

 <blockquote>  <img src="fig1.png" width="300" alt="fig1" />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <img src="fig2.png" width="175" alt="fig2" />
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
The map from <em>G</em>
 to   <em>G</em>/&equiv;<sub><em>b</em></sub>
 takes the 2-points to  the point 2,
and the 3-points to the point 3.
</p>

<p>
Up until now, we have said what bisimulation is, but we did not describe 
its relation to anything else.    To rectify matters, here is the main result.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Theorem</strong>
Assume <em>AFA</em>.   Let <em>G</em> be a graph, let <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> 
be nodes of <em>G</em>, and let <em>d</em> be the decoration of <em>G</em>.
Then the following are equivalent:
</p>
<ol>
<li>   <em>d</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>d</em>(<em>y</em>).
</li>
<li> There is a bisimulation relating <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>.
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
 
 
 <p>
We are not going to prove this theorem in full here, but instead here
are two hints.   To prove that (1) implies (2), check that 
the <em>kernel relation of d</em>, 
</p>

<blockquote>
{(<em>u</em>, <em>v</em>) : <em>d</em>(<em>u</em>) = <em>d</em>(<em>v</em>)}
</blockquote>

<p>
is a bisimulation on <em>G</em>.
</p>

<p>
In the other direction, the idea is to turn a bisimulation into a graph
itself, and then extract two decorations of it; by the uniqueness part
of <em>AFA</em> these must coincide.
Here is how this is done in a concrete example.  
We saw above that 
</p>

<blockquote>
<em>R</em> &thinsp;=&thinsp; 
 {(2<em>a</em>, 2<em>b</em>), (2<em>b</em>, 2<em>c</em>), (2<em>c</em>, 2<em>a</em>),
(3<em>a</em>, 3<em>b</em>), (3<em>b</em>, 3<em>c</em>), 
(3<em>c</em>, 3<em>a</em>)}. 
</blockquote>

<p>
is a bisimulation.   
We make it into a graph by taking the product relation.
This gives the following graph which we call <em>H</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<img src="fig3.png" width="350" alt="fig3" />
</blockquote>

<p>
Let <em>d</em> be a decoration (no, <em>the</em> decoration)
 of <em>G</em>.
We get two decorations of <em>H</em>,  <em>k</em> and <em>l</em> defined by
</p>

<blockquote>
<em>k</em>(<em>u</em>, <em>v</em>) = <em>d</em>(<em>u</em>), 
and  <em>l</em>(<em>u</em>, <em>v</em>) = <em>d</em>(<em>v</em>).
 </blockquote>

<p>
 (It is good to check that these really are decorations of <em>H</em>.)
 But <em>H</em> can have only one decoration.    So <em>k</em> = <em>b</em>.
 And then, corresponding to the fact that  
  2<em>a</em>&thinsp;<em>R</em>&thinsp;2<em>c</em>,
  for example, 
 we have
</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>d</em>(2<em>a</em>) = <em>k</em>(2<em>a</em>,2<em>b</em>) 
=  <em>l</em>(2<em>a</em>,2<em>b</em>)
=
  <em>d</em>(2<em>b</em>).
 </blockquote> 
 
 <p>
 This concludes our sketch.  For more details, see Aczel (1988).
</p>

<h3><a name="3.2">3.2 Doing without <em>AFA</em></a></h3>

<p>
Our work on bisimulation above can be used to effect a 
reduction of the of non-wellfounded sets to that of ordinary sets,
much in the spirit of what we saw for streams and functions in
<a href="#sectionstreams">Section 1.1</a>.
    There are several ways to 
describe such a reduction.   
</p>

<p>
A <em>pointed graph</em> is a triple  (<em>G</em>,&rarr;, <em>g</em>) 
 such that  &rarr;  is 
a relation on <em>G</em>
 and <em>g</em>&thinsp;&isin;&thinsp; <em>G</em>.
   A <em>bisimulation</em>
 between pointed graphs  (<em>G</em>,&rarr;, <em>g</em>)  and 
  (<em>H</em>,&rArr;, <em>h</em>)  
is a bisimulation  <em>R</em>
 between  (<em>G</em>,&rarr;)  and 
 (<em>H</em>,&rArr;)   such that
<em>g &thinsp; R &thinsp; h</em>.  
</p>

<p>
In the remainder of this discussion, we let 
<em>p</em>, <em>q</em>,  &hellip;  denote 
pointed graphs.    We write   <em>p</em> &equiv;<sub><em>b</em></sub>
<em>q</em>
 if there is a bisimulation
between <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>.   We write 
<em>p</em> &epsilon;
<em>q</em>
 if
there is a pointed graph  (<em>G</em>,&rarr;, <em>g</em>)
 and some <em>g</em> &rarr; <em>h</em>
in <em>G</em>
 so that
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<em>p</em> &equiv;
 (<em>G</em>,&rarr;, <em>h</em>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;
<em>q</em>  &equiv;
 (<em>G</em>,&rarr;, <em>g</em>).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sentences in the language of set theory talk about sets, and
we translate them to sentences about pointed graphs by 
restricting all quantifiers to the class of pointed graphs, and then
translating &isin; to &epsilon;, and &equiv; for  =.  For
example, the Axiom of Extensionality</p>
 
<blockquote>
<p>
&forall;<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>(<em>x</em>=<em>y</em> &rarr; 
 &forall;<em>z</em>(<em>z</em> &isin; <em>x</em> &rarr;
 <em>z</em> &isin; <em>y</em>)).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
would translate to (where <em>p</em>, <em>q</em>, <em>r</em> range over
pointed graphs):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&forall;<em>p</em>,<em>q</em>(<em>p</em> &equiv; <em>q</em> &rarr;
 &forall;<em>r</em>(<em>r</em> &epsilon; <em>p</em> &rarr;
 <em>r</em> &epsilon; <em>q</em>)).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This last sentence is then provable.  (Hint: the union of any set
of bisimulations on a graph is again a bisimulation on it.)
</p>

<p>
Indeed, all of the axioms of <em>ZFA</em> are provable, including <em>AFA</em>.
This is a fairly long and tedious verification, but it is not so tricky.    
  A version of it
(for set theory with <em>urelements</em>, objects which are not sets)
is the topic of a chapter in Barwise and Moss (1996).
</p>

<p>
One can also go further: instead of translating the identity relation
 =  into something more complex, we may keep the language simple
and complicate the interpretation.   We would like to replace &ldquo;pointed graph&rdquo;
by &ldquo;&equiv;-class of pointed graph&rdquo;. Since these are not sets, we instead
employ <em>Scott&rsquo;s trick</em> and instead use &ldquo;set of 
well-founded pointed graphs whose node sets are 
&equiv;-equivalent
and with the property that no pointed graph of smaller rank is 
also  &equiv;-equivalent to them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Doing all of this leads to relative consistency result:
</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Theorem</strong>.
If   <em>ZFC</em> is consistent, then so is   <em>ZFA</em>,
and vice-versa.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="3.3">3.3 Extended graphs</a></h3>

<p>
The way we have presented graphs, decorations, and <em>AFA</em> is a 
very &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; presentation.  
 If one would like some node of a graph <em>G</em>
to be decorated by some set  <em>a</em>
 the most obvious way would be to
add all the elements of <em>tc</em>({<em>x</em>})
 as fresh nodes in <em>G</em>, with
<em>y</em>&rarr; <em>z</em>  iff <em>z</em> &isin; <em>y</em>.   
This means that one must take new copies
if some of the sets in <em>tc</em>({<em>x</em>})
 already happen to be nodes in <em>G</em>.
This is often cumbersome:
when working with graphs and decorations, one might well want to 
<em>pre-specify</em> as much as possible the value of the decoration on
a node.    There are several ways to do this with <em>AFA</em>, and we&rsquo;ll indicate
one here.
</p>

<p>
Two sets are <em>disjoint</em> if their intersection is
empty.    When one takes the union of two sets,
say <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>,  it is sometimes
a good idea to make sure that no element occurs
in both sets.   The way to do this is to replace one or both
of  <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> by copies.
</p>

<p>
The <em>disjoint</em> union of sets  <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> 
 is  <em>a</em>+ <em>b</em>,  defined by
</p>

<blockquote>
 <em>a</em>+<em>b</em>  =  (<em>a</em> &thinsp;&times; {0})
 &cup;  (<em>b</em> &thinsp; &times; {1}).
</blockquote>

<p>
It is easy to see that the two sets in the union are disjoint:
the elements of  <em>a</em>+ <em>b</em>
 &ldquo;wear on their sleeve&rdquo; a mark of which
set they come from.
</p>

<p>
The disjoint union comes with two natural functions:
</p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial">inl</font>
:  <em>a</em> &rarr; <em>a</em>+ <em>b</em>
&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;
<font face="Arial">inr</font>
: <em>b</em> &rarr; <em>a</em>+ <em>b</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
defined by <font face="Arial">inl</font>(<i>x</i>) = 
&lang;<i>x</i>,0&rang; 
 and  <font face="Arial">inr</font>(<i>x</i>) = 
&lang;<i>x</i>,1&rang;  .
<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
A <em>graph extended with set parameters</em>  (or <em>extended graph</em> for short)
is a set <em>G</em>
 together with a function 
 <em>e</em>: <em>G</em>&rarr; 
     &weierp;<em>G</em>+<em>V</em>.
 If  <em>e</em>(<em>g</em>) 
  is of the form  
&lang;<em>s</em>,0&rang; 
 for some <em>s</em> &sube; <em>G</em>, then 
we intend it as a node just as in our earlier treatment. 
  In particular, we want to decorate
it with the set of decorations of its children.   If  <em>e</em>(<em>g</em>) = 
&lang;<em>x</em>,1&rang; ,
 then
we want a decoration to be forced to have the value <em>x</em> on <em>g</em>.  
</p>

<p>
Formally, a decoration of an extended graph is a function <em>d</em> defined on <em>G</em>
so that for all <em>g</em> &isin; <em>G</em>,
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>

Here is an example: 
Let <em>G</em> be the extended graph with node set 
{<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>}
and with <em>e</em> given by
</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr>
<td><em>e</em>(<em>w</em>) = </td>

&lang;{<em>w</em>, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>}, 0&rang;

 <em>e</em>(<em>x</em>)  =

   <em>e</em>(<em>z</em>)   =

Then a decoration <em>d</em> of this extended graph
 would satisfy the following conditions:

 <strong>Theorem</strong>
Assume <em>AFA</em>.

<p>
The point we are trying to make is that there is quite a bit of theory
around to facilitate working in <em>ZFA</em> in order to do modeling of
various forms of circular phenomena.
</p>

<h3><a name="3.4">3.4 Collection circularity in <em>ZFA</em></a></h3>

<p>
 The fact that <em>AFA</em> allows us to solve various kinds of
systems of set equations is only the beginning.  When we discussed
infinite trees in
 <a href="#sectiontrees">Section 1.2</a>,
 we noted that the collection <em>Tr</em> of infinite trees
<em>should</em> satisfy (7), repeated below: </p>

<blockquote>
<em>Tr</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;
 {<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>} &cup; ({&bull;} &times; <em>Tr</em>) &cup;
  ({*} &times; <em>Tr</em> &times; <em>Tr</em>).
 </blockquote>

<p>
A similar equation should hold of streams from 
<a href="#sectionstreams">Section 1.1</a>:
</p>

 <blockquote>
<em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;  <em>N</em> &times;
<em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup> .
 </blockquote>

<p>
For that matter,  the universe <em>V</em>
of sets should satisfy
 </p>
 
 <blockquote>
<em>V</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&weierp;<em>V</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
Assuming the Power Set Axiom and the formulation of 
&weierp; as an operator
on classes, the universe 
<em>V</em> does satisfy this equation.
</p>

<p>
We are free to step back and think of these as equations which
we hope to solve.   For example, we could take the set <em>N</em> as known,
regard <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup> as a variable, and then consider an equation like
<em>X</em> = <em>N</em>&times;<em>X</em>.    
However, the  none of these is the kind of equation that we could hope to
solve in a perfectly general way using <em>AFA</em>: the right-hand sides are 
not given in terms of sets of objects on the left.
Solving more complicated systems takes special additional  work.
Here is what is known on this.
</p>

<p>
First, under <em>FA</em>,  
the first two of our three equations each have a unique
solution: the empty set.   Under <em>AFA</em>, they have many solutions.
For example, for the stream equation, the set of streams corresponding to
functions which are eventually  0 is a solution.   
However, the <em>largest</em> solutions are of special interest.   
For these, one can prove that the largest solutions are in one-to-one correspondence
with what we have called the unraveled forms.   And for other reasons which we
shall see, there is a good reason to accept the claim that the largest solutions
are good mathematical models of the intuitive concepts. 
</p>

<p>
Under <em>AFA</em>, things are different.   Here is the general picture:
An operator on sets <em>F</em> is  <em>monotone</em> if whenever
<em>a</em> &sube; <em>b</em>,
then also <em>Fa</em> &sube; <em>Fb</em>.
    This is a very common feature
for operators on sets.   The <em>polynomial operators on sets</em>
are the smallest collection containing the constant operators, 
and closed under cartesian product, disjoint union, and functions from
a fixed set.    For example, if <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are fixed sets, then 
<em>Fs</em>  = (<em>A</em> &times; <em>s</em>)  +
 <sup><em>B</em></sup>(<em>s</em> + <em>A</em>) is a polynomial operator on sets.
If one also allows the power set operator to occur, then we
get the <em>power polynomial operators</em>.   Every power polynomial operator
is
monotone.    And now, we have the following results due to  Aczel:
</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>
 <strong>Proposition</strong>. Then 
 every monotone operator  <em>F</em> on
sets has a least fixed point <em>F</em><sub>*</sub>   and a
 greatest fixed point  <em>F</em><sup>*</sup>.    In particular, 
 every polynomial operator on classes has least 
 and greatest fixed points.      On classes, the same is true for
 the  larger collection of power polynomial operators.
 </p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
Assuming <em>FA</em>, the fixed points are unique; frequently they are the 
empty set.   
With <em>AFA</em>, the greatest fixed points usually have non-wellfounded 
members.    We shall study this in more detail when we turn to coalgebra.
For now,  we return to the last of the example equations
at the top of this section, 
<em>V</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp;&weierp;<em>V</em>.
 This equation has no solutions
in sets due to 
<a href="#Cantor">Cantor&rsquo;s Theorem</a>.
However, in terms of classes, this equation does have solutions, as we
know.   The universal class  <em>V</em>
 is a solution, as we have seen.   
And the class <em>WF</em> of well-founded sets is a solution.   This is the 
smallest solution &weierp;<sub>*</sub>, and 
 <em>V</em>  is the largest.    Under <em>FA</em>, 
&weierp;<sup>*</sup>
 = <em>V</em>
   = &weierp;<sub>*</sub>.   Under <em>AFA</em>, 
 &weierp;<sub>*</sub>
  and &weierp;<sup>*</sup> are
different: 
&weierp;<sub>*</sub>  = <em>WF</em>, and 
&weierp;<sup>*</sup> =  <em>V</em>
 and thus contains 
sets such as  &Omega;= {&Omega;}.
</p>

<h2><a name="4">4. Comparing Foundation and Anti-Foundation</a></h2>

<p>
The purpose of this section is to compare <em>FA</em> and <em>AFA</em> in a 
technical way, using ideas from category theory.    That is, the 
language of category theory and especially its 
built-in feature of <em>duality</em> are used to say something insightful
about the relation between <em>FA</em> and <em>AFA</em>.    Further, the dual
statements about the axioms
 suggest a much more systematic and thoroughgoing 
duality about a host of other concepts.    This deeper point is
not a strictly mathematical result but rather more of a research program,
and so the final subsection here will detail some of what is known
about it.
</p>

<p>
As we said, our work here begins to use category theory.
We realize that not all readers will be familiar with that subject
at all.    
So we shall 
try to make this section as accessible as possible.
In particular, we&rsquo;ll 
only present those notions from category theory that we actually
need in our work of this section.      We also illustrate all of the 
definitions on a few categories which will be of interest.  And as we go
on in future sections, we&rsquo;ll develop only the background that we 
need.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
</p>

<p>
Our use of category theory is mainly for the terminology and intuition.   
We know that there are philosophical issues connected with the use
of category theory as a foundation for mathematics.     This entry does not
deal  with any of these issues in a head-on way.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Initial and final objects</strong>.
</p>

<p>
We need a definition from category theory.
Fix a category <em>C</em>.
An object <em>x</em>  is <em>initial</em> if for every object <em>y</em>
there is exactly one morphism 
<em>f</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>x</em> &rarr; <em>y</em> 
Dually, an object <em>x</em>  is <em>final</em> if for every object <em>y</em>
there is exactly one morphism
<em>f</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>y</em> &rarr; <em>x</em>.
</p>
 

<p>
In  <font face="Arial">Set</font>, the empty set is an initial object; for every set <em>y</em>,
the empty function is the only function from  &empty; to <em>y</em>.
In addition, the empty set is the only initial object.
</p>

<p>
As for final objects, every singleton {<em>x</em>} is a final object.
For every set <em>y</em>, the constant function with value <em>x</em> is the only
function from <em>y</em>  to <em>x</em>.    And the singletons are the only final objects 
in the category.
</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Proposition</strong>
Let <em>C</em> be a category, and  <em>a</em>
 and <em>b</em>
be initial objects.
Then <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are
<em>isomorphic</em> objects: there are 
morphisms
<em>f</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>a</em> &rarr; <em>b</em> 
and 
<em>g</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>b</em> &rarr; <em>a</em> 
and  
 such that
  <em>g</em>&sdot;<em>f</em> = <em>id</em><sub><em>a</em></sub>
and 
 <em>f</em>&sdot;<em>g</em> = <em>id</em><sub><em>b</em></sub>.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Proof</strong>
By initiality, we get (unique) morphisms <em>f</em> and <em>g</em> as in our statement.
Note that
<em>g</em>&sdot;<em>f</em> is a morphism from
<em>a</em> to itself.   And since 
<em>a</em> is initial
and <em>id</em><sub><em>a</em></sub>
 is also such a morphism, we see that 
 <em>g</em>&sdot;<em>f</em> 
   = <em>id</em><sub><em>a</em></sub>.
Similarly for  <em>b</em>.
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="4.1">4.1 The category of sets, the category of classes</a></h3>

<p>
We refer the reader to the entry on 
  <a href="../category-theory/index.html">category theory</a>
 for the definitions of category and functor.
</p>

<p>
We need to mention the objects and morphisms in the categories of sets
and of classes, and also to spell out the functors of interest on
them.
</p>

<p>
<strong><font face="Arial">Set</font></strong>.
The objects are the sets, and the morphisms 
 are triples 
&lang;<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>f</em>&rang;,  where
<em>f</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>x</em> &rarr; <em>y</em>.  That is,
each triple &lang; <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>f</em>&rang; is a
morphism from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em>.  The identity
morphism <em>id</em><sub><em>a</em></sub> for a set <em>a</em> is
&lang;<em>a</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>f</em>&rang; , where <em>f</em> is
the identity function on <em>a</em> and the composition operation of
morphisms is given by:
</p>
  
  <blockquote>
  <p>
&lang;<em>y</em>, <em>z</em>, <em>g</em>&rang;  &sdot; 
&lang;<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>f</em>&rang;  = 
&lang;<em>x</em>, <em>z</em>, <em>g</em> &sdot; <em>f</em>&rang; 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>Functors on <font face="Arial">Set</font></strong>.
The polynomial operators on sets extend to
 endofunctors on <font face="Arial">Set</font>.     The way that these operations are defined
 on morphisms is straightforward and may be found in any book
 on category theory.   Here is a brief summary:
 For any set <em>s</em>, the constant functor with value <em>s</em> is a functor
on <font face="Arial">Set</font>.  
 It takes every function to  <em>id</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>.
For any two functors <em>F</em> and <em>G</em>,
we have a functor  <em>F</em>&times;
<em>G</em>
defined by  (<em>F</em>&times;
<em>G</em>)(<em>a</em>) = <em>F</em><em>a</em> &times;
<em>G</em><em>a</em>; here we use the 
cartesian product on sets.   If 
<em>f</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>a</em> &rarr; <em>b</em>, then 
</p>

<blockquote>
(<em>F</em>&times;
 <em>G</em>)<em>f</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>)  =
(<em>F</em><em>f</em>(<em>a</em>), <em>G</em><em>f</em>(<em>b</em>)).
</blockquote>

<p>
We also have a functor <em>F</em>+<em>G</em> defined by 
 (<em>F</em> + <em>G</em>)(<em>a</em>) = <em>Fa</em>+ <em>Ga</em>
 using the coproduct on sets, that is, the disjoint union.
 Here the action on morphisms is by cases 
 </p>
 
 <blockquote>
 <p>
  (<em>F</em> + <em>G</em>)(<em>f</em>)
  (<font face="Arial">inl</font> <em>x</em>) = <em>Ff</em>(<em>x</em>)
  </p>
  
  <p> 
    (<em>F</em> + <em>G</em>)(<em>f</em>)
  (<font face="Arial">inr</font> <em>x</em>) = <em>Gf</em>(<em>x</em>)
  </p>
  </blockquote>

 
  <p>
A special case is <em>Fx</em> = <em>x</em> + 1.  That is,  
<em>Fx</em> is the disjoint union of <em>x</em>
with a singleton.   And if <em>f</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>x</em> &rarr; <em>y</em>,
 then 
 <em>Ff</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>Fx</em> &rarr; <em>Fy</em>
works in much the same way, taking the new point in <em>x</em> to the new point in <em>y</em>,
and otherwise behaving like <em>f</em>.
</p>

<p>
The power polynomial operators  also extend to endofunctors on <font face="Arial">Set</font>:
on morphisms
<em>f</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>x</em> &rarr; <em>y</em>, 
the function 
&weierp;<em>f</em>:
     &weierp;<em>x</em> &rarr; 
     &weierp;<em>y</em>
 takes each subset <em>a</em> &sube;
<em>x</em>
to its  image 
</p>

<blockquote>
<em>f</em>[<em>a</em>]  = {<em>f</em>(<em>z</em>) : <em>z</em> &thinsp; &isin; &thinsp;
         <em>a</em>}.
</blockquote>

<p>
<strong><font face="Arial">Class</font></strong>.
Here the objects are formulas in the language of set theory
&phi;(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em><sub><em>1</em></sub>,&hellip;, <em>y</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>) together with <em>n</em> sets  <em>a</em><sub><em>1</em></sub>,&hellip;, 
 <em>a</em><sub>n</sub>.
We think of this as 
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
{<em>b</em> : &phi;[<em>b</em>,  <em>a</em><sub><em>1</em></sub>,&hellip;, 
 <em>a</em><sub>n</sub>]}.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The morphisms are then triples consisting of two 
formulas with parameters defining the domain and codomain,
and a third one with two free parameters defining the action
of the morphism.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Functors on <font face="Arial">Class</font></strong>.
The functors of interest are again the power polynomials.
They are defined on 
 <font face="Arial">Class</font>
  similarly to the way they are defined on  <font face="Arial">Set</font>.
For our purposes, the main difference between  the two categories
 is that
in <font face="Arial">
Set</font>  we cannot solve  
&weierp;(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em>, while we can do so in 
 <font face="Arial">Class</font>.
</p>

<h3><a name="4.2">4.2 Algebras  for a functor</a></h3>

<p>
Let <em>F</em> be an endofunctor on a category 
<em>C</em>.
 An <em>algebra for
<em>F</em></em> is a pair  (<em>c</em>, <em>f</em>),
where  <em>c</em>  is an object of <em>C</em>, and
<em>f</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>Fc</em> &rarr; <em>c</em>.
</p>

<p>
Here is a basic example that illustrates why these are called 
<em>algebras</em>.    
Let&rsquo;s take the category <font face="Arial">Set</font>
 of sets, and the functor
</p>

<blockquote> <em>Ha</em>  = (<em>a</em> &times; <em>a</em>)   + 
(<em>a</em> &times; <em>a</em>). 
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
For the object <em>N</em> of natural numbers,  <em>HN</em> is thus
two copies of <em>N</em>&times;<em>N</em>.
  We&rsquo;ll use colors to indicate
the different copies, with red for the first copy and blue for
the second.  So we can view  <em>HN</em> as

<p>
One example of an algebra for this functor
is  (<em>N</em>, <em>&alpha;</em>), 
where
&alpha;(<font color="red"><em>a</em>, <em>b</em></font>)
 = <em>a + b</em> and  
&alpha;(<font color="blue"><em>a</em>, <em>b</em></font>) 
= <em>a</em> &times;
<em>b</em>.  In other words, &alpha; operates on the red pairs
by adding and on the blue pairs by multiplying.
</p>

<p>
Getting back to the terminology of &ldquo;algebra&rdquo;, the point is that 
the function &alpha; does the work of the two tables.   
The function &ldquo;is&rdquo; the tables.
</p>

<p>
Here is another example of an algebra.  
This time we are concerned on  <font face="Arial">Set</font>  with 
<em>Fx</em> = <em>x</em> +1, as defined above.
The algebra we have in mind is  (<em>N</em>, <em>s</em>).   Here
<em>s</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>N</em>+1  &rarr; <em>N</em> 
takes the  natural number <em>n</em> to its successor <em>n</em>+1,
and the new point in <em>N</em>+1  to the number 0.
</p>

<p>
Up until now, we have merely given examples of algebras for
different functors.
The advantage of the categorical  formulation is that the usual notions
of a <em>morphism of algebras</em> turn out to be special case
of a more general definition.
</p>

<p>
Let  
 (<em>c</em>, <em>f</em>) 
  and 
   (<em>d</em>, <em>g</em>) 
be algebras for the same functor <em>F</em> on the category <em>C</em>.
A <em>morphism of algebras from</em>
 (<em>c</em>, <em>f</em>) 
to
   (<em>d</em>, <em>g</em>) 
    is
a morphism 
<em>&alpha;</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>c</em> &rarr; <em>d</em>
  so that
the diagram below commutes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td valign="bottom"><em>Fc</em></td>
<td align="center"><small><em>f</em></small><br />&rarr;</td>
<td valign="bottom"><em>c</em></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><small><em>F</em>&alpha;</small></td>
<td>&darr;</td>
<td></td>
<td>&darr;</td>
<td><small>&alpha;</small></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td valign="top"><em>Fd</em></td>
<td align="center">&rarr;<br /><small><em>g</em></small></td>
<td valign="top"><em>d</em></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
(This means that the two compositions, 
&alpha; &sdot; <em>f</em> and 
 <em>g</em>&sdot;<em>F</em>&alpha;,
 are the same function.)
</p>

<p>
It now is clear that we have a category of algebras for a given functor.
And so we  immediately have the concept of <em>initial</em> and <em>final</em>
algebras.   There is no guarantee that these exist, but in many interesting cases 
they do.    The reason we are interested in initial algebras is their connection to
<em>recursion</em>.     
</p>

<p>
To see this in detail, we return to the functor 
<em>Fx</em> = <em>x</em> + 1
 on <font face="Arial">Set</font>.
We saw the algebra  (<em>N</em>, <em>s</em>) 
 above.    We claim that this is an initial algebra.
What this means is that for any algebra  
 (<em>A</em>, <em>a</em>), there is a unique algebra morphism
 <em>h</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp; (<em>N</em>, <em>s</em>)  &rarr;  (<em>N</em>, <em>s</em>).
   That is, the diagram below commutes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td valign="bottom"><em>N</em>+1</td>
<td align="center"><small><em>s</em></small><br />&rarr;</td>
<td valign="bottom"><em>N</em></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><small><em>h</em>+1</small></td>
<td>&darr;</td>
<td></td>
<td>&darr;</td>
<td><small><em>h</em></small></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td valign="top"><em>A</em>+1</td>
<td align="center">&rarr;<br /><small><em>a</em></small></td>
<td valign="top"><em>A</em></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thue function <em>a</em> from <em>A</em>+1 to <em>A</em> may be decomposed into 
a map 
 <em>i</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>A</em> &rarr; <em>A</em> 
together with
an element <em>b</em> &isin; <em>a</em>.
  And to say that the diagram above commutes
is the same thing as saying that 
 <em>h</em>(0) =  <em>b</em>, and for all <em>n</em> &isin; <em>N</em>,
 <em>h</em>(<em>s</em>(<em>n</em>)) =  <em>a</em>(<em>h</em>(<em>n</em>)).
</p>

<p>
Stepping back, the purported initiality of  (<em>N</em>, <em>s</em>) is the same as the following assertion:
</p>

<blockquote>
For every set <em>A</em>, every <em>b</em>&thinsp;&isin;&thinsp;<em>A</em>,
 and every 
 <em>a</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>A</em> &rarr; <em>A</em>,
 there is a unique
function <em>h</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>N</em> &rarr; <em>A</em> 
 such that 
<em>h</em>(0) = <em>b</em>, 
and for all 
<em>n</em>&thinsp;&isin;&thinsp;<em>N</em>,
  <em>h</em>(s(<em>n</em>)) = <em>a</em>(<em>h</em>(<em>n</em>)).
</blockquote>

<p>
 This is the standard form of the Principle of Recursion on <em>N</em>.
The upshot is that this principle is equivalent to the assertion that 
 (<em>N</em>, <em>s</em>)  is an
initial algebra of the functor <em>Fx</em> = <em>x</em> +1.     
</p>

<p>
One way to interpret this equivalence is that we can take the existence
of an initial algebra for 
<em>Fx</em>  = 
<em>x</em>+ 1
 as an <em>axiom of set theory</em>,
in place of the usual Axiom of Infinity.   That axiom says that there is
an algebra for the singleton functor 
<em>Sx</em> = {<em>x</em>}
 on sets which contains
&empty; as an element and whose structure is the inclusion.
This principle is easier to state than the algebraic reformulation.
It takes a bit of work to use the simpler standard formulation to derive
the Recursion Principle, and this is one of the basic topics in any
course on axiomatic set theory.
</p>

<p>
Two general facts: 
First,  the structure map of an initial algebra on  <font face="Arial">Set</font>  is always 
a bijection.  This follows from a very general result in category theory due to J. Lambek.
And from this we see that &weierp;
 has no initial algebras on  <font face="Arial">Set</font>, by 
 <a href="#Cantor">Cantor&rsquo;s Theorem</a>.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Initial algebras for polynomial functors on  <font face="Arial">Set</font></strong>.
</p>

<p>
Let <em>F</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<font face="Arial"> Set </font>&rarr; <font face="Arial">Set</font> 
 be a power polynomial functor.     We know that <em>F</em> is 
monotone (it preserves the subset relation on sets), and 
it is not hard to check a slightly stronger property:  <em>F</em> preserves
inclusion maps between classes:    An <em>inclusion</em>
is a  map <em>i</em><sub><em>a</em>, <em>b</em></sub>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>a</em> &rarr; <em>b</em> 
 on classes which &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t do anything&rdquo;:
<em>a</em> must be a subset of <em>b</em>,
and for all <em>x</em> &isin; <em>a</em>, 
<em>i</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em>.  
We say that <em>F</em> is <em>standard</em> if it preserves inclusions in 
the sense that 
<em>F</em><em>i</em><sub><em>a</em>, <em>b</em></sub>  = 
<em>i</em><sub><em>Fa</em>, <em>Fb</em></sub>.
Once again, every power polynomial endofunctor on 
<font face="Arial">Set</font> is standard.
</p>

<p>
The polynomial
operations on sets (without power)  are also <em>continuous</em>:
they preserve countable unions of sets.   
</p>

<p>
Let <em>F</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<font face="Arial"> Set </font>&rarr; <font face="Arial">Set</font>  be a polynomial endofunctor.
We sketch the proof that the least fixed point <em>F</em><sub>*</sub>
 carries the structure
of an initial algebra, together with the identity on it.   
</p>

<p>
One forms the increasing sequence
</p>

<blockquote>
0    &sube; <em>F</em>0  &sube; <em>F</em>(<em>F</em>0)  &sube; 
<em>F</em>(<em>F</em>(<em>F</em>0)) &hellip;
</blockquote>
 
 <p>
We write 0 for &empty;.
Each of the maps shown is an inclusion, by standardness.
Let <em>F</em><sub>*</sub> be the union of the increasing sequence 
<em>F</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>0 of sets.
Then <em>F</em>(<em>F</em><sub>*</sub>) = <em>F</em><sub>*</sub>
  by continuity.    So  (<em>F</em><sub>*</sub>, <em>id</em>)  is an algebra for <em>F</em>.
To check initiality, let 
(<em>A</em>, <em>a</em>)
be an algebra for <em>F</em>, 
so
 <em>a</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>Fa</em> &rarr; <em>a</em>.
Define maps
 <em>g<sub>n</sub></em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>F</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>(0)
  &rarr; <em>A</em> 
 by recursion, with 
  <em>g<sub>0</sub></em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;0
  &rarr; <em>A</em> 
 the empty function
(this is what initiality of &empty; amounts to), and 
  <em>g</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub> = 
  <em>a</em> &sdot; <em>Fg</em><sub><em>n</em></sub>.
Check that we have an increasing sequence of functions
</p>

<blockquote>
g<sub>0</sub> &sube;
g<sub>1</sub> &sube;
g<sub>2</sub> &sube;
 &hellip;
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>
then take the union to get  
&phi; &thinsp;:&thinsp; <em>F</em><sub>*</sub> &rarr; <em>A</em>.
One checks that this &phi; is a morphism of <em>F</em>-algebras, and indeed
is the only such.
</p>

 
<h3><a name="4.3">4.3 Coalgebras for a functor</a></h3>

<p>
We now turn to coalgebras.
Again, let <em>F</em> be an endofunctor on a category <em>C</em>.
A <em>coalgebra for <em>F</em></em> is a pair (<em>c</em>, <em>f</em>), where 
<em>c</em>
is an object of <em>C</em>, and 
<em>f</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>c</em> &rarr; <em>Fc</em>.   Comparing
this to the definition of an algebra, we can see that a
coalgebra is the same kind of structure, except that the 
direction of the arrow is reversed.
</p>

<p>
For example, every graph is a coalgebra of  &weierp;  on 
<em>F</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<font face="Arial"> Set </font>&rarr; <font face="Arial">Set</font>.
That is, every graph  (<em>G</em>,&rarr;)  may be re-packaged 
as  (<em>G</em>, <em>e</em>), with
<em>e</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>G</em> &rarr;
 &weierp; 
 <em>G</em> 
given by
 <em>e</em>(<em>x</em>) = {<em>y</em> &isin; <em>G</em> :
       <em>x</em>&rarr; <em>y</em>}.   In words, we trade in the 
edge relation of a graph with the function that assigns to each
point its set of children.    This re-packaging has an inverse,
and so the notions of &ldquo;graph as set with relation&rdquo;
and &ldquo;graph as coalgebra of &weierp;&rdquo; 
are in this sense
notational variants.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup></p>

<p>
Let 
 (<em>c</em>, <em>f</em>)
  and 
   (<em>e</em>, <em>g</em>)
    be coalgebras for the same functor.
A <em>morphism of coalgebras from 
 (<em>c</em>, <em>f</em>)
  to 
   (<em>d</em>, <em>g</em>)
   </em> is
a morphism 
 <em>&alpha;</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>c</em> &rarr; <em>d</em> 
  in the category <em>C</em> so that
the diagram below commutes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td></td>
<td valign="bottom"><em>c</em></td>
<td align="center"><small><em>f</em></small><br />&rarr;</td>
<td valign="bottom"><em>Fc</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><small>&alpha;</small></td>
<td>&darr;</td>

<td>&darr;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><em>F</em>&alpha;</small></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td valign="top"><em>d</em></td>
<td align="center">&rarr;<br /><small><em>g</em></small></td>
<td valign="top"><em>Fd</em></td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
 
<p>
A coalgebra (<em>d</em>, <em>g</em>) is a <em>final</em> (or <em>terminal</em>)
coalgebra if for every coalgebra  (<em>c</em>, <em>f</em>), there is a 
<em>unique</em> morphism of coalgebras 
<em>&alpha;</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;(<em>c,f</em>) &rarr; (<em>d,g</em>).
</p>

<p>
Here is another example as we wind our way back
to set theory.
These are based on discussions at the beginning of this entry,
concerning streams of numbers 
(<a href="#sectionstreams">Section 1.1</a>).
We are dealing with the functor <em>Fa</em> = <em>N</em>&times;<em>a</em>.   
Then a 
system of stream equations is  a coalgebra for <em>F</em>.
To see how this works in a concrete case, we return
to  equation (2), reiterated below:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<td valign="top">(2)</td>
<td><em>x</em> &asymp; 
&lang;0,&thinsp;<em>y</em>&rang; </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><em>y</em>  &asymp;  
&lang;1,&thinsp;<em>z</em>&rang; </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td><em>z</em>  &asymp;  
&lang;2,&thinsp;<em>x</em>&rang; </td>
</tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
We regard  this system as a coalgebra (<em>X</em>, <em>e</em>), where 
<em>X</em> = {<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>},
<em>e</em>(<em>x</em>) = 
&lang;0,y&rang; , 
 and similarly for <em>e</em>(<em>y</em>)  and <em>z</em>(<em>x</em>) .
So now we have a concrete example  of
a  coalgebra  for this <em>F</em>.   Another
coalgebra for <em>F</em> uses the set <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup>  of streams as its
carrier set.   The coalgebra itself is  
</p>

<blockquote>
(<em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup>, 
&lang;<font face="Arial">head</font>,
  <font face="Arial">tail</font>&rang; ).
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
This coalgebra is final.   We shall not verify this here, but instead we
apply this point.
By finality, 
 there is a unique 
 <em>e</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>X</em> &rarr; 
 <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup>
such that the diagram
below commutes:
</p>

<blockquote>

<table border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">

<tr>
<td></td>
<td valign="bottom"><em>Fc</em></td>
<td align="center"><small><em>f</em></small><br />&rarr;</td>
<td valign="bottom"><em>c</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><small><em>F</em>&alpha;</small></td>
<td>&darr;</td>
<td></td>
<td>&darr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>&alpha;</small></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td valign="top"><em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup></td>
<td align="center">&rarr;<br />&lang;&thinsp;<font size="1" face="Arial">head</font>,
  <font size="1" face="Arial">tail</font>&thinsp;&rang;</td>
<td valign="top"><em>N</em> &times; <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup></td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
We now  follow the elements of <em>X</em> around the diagram
both ways.
For <em>x</em>, this tells us that 
</p>

<blockquote>
&lang;<font face="Arial">head</font>,
  <font face="Arial">tail</font>&rang; 
  (<em>e</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>(<em>x</em>))
  =
 &lang;0, <em>e</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>(<em>y</em>)&rang; 
</blockquote>

<p>
That is, 
<em>e</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>(<em>x</em>) is a stream whose
first component is 0 and whose second component is 
<em>e</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>(<em>y</em>).
Similar observations hold for
<em>e</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>(<em>y</em>)
and <em>e</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>(<em>z</em>), of course.
The upshot is that
the three streams
<em>e</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>(<em>x</em>),
<em>e</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>(<em>y</em>)
and <em>e</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>(<em>z</em>)
are exactly the ones we are after.
</p>

<p>
Much the same applies to the tree example from
<a href="#sectiontrees">Section 1.2</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="4.4">4.4 The axioms again</a></h3>

<p>
At this point we rephrase <em>FA</em> and <em>AFA</em> to make a comparison.
Recall that <em>V</em>
 is the class of all sets, and that 
 <em>V</em> = &weierp;<em>V</em>.  This
means that (trivially) the identity on the universe maps <em>V</em> onto
&weierp;<em>V</em>, and vice-versa.  Despite this, we want to introduce notation
for these two maps that makes them different.  We shall write
</p>

<blockquote>  <em>i</em>: 
     &weierp;<em>V</em> &rarr; <em>V</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus <em>i</em>
takes a multiplicity (a set of sets) and
regards it as a unity (a set).
We also have a map in the other direction
</p>

<blockquote>  <em>j</em>: <em>V</em> &rarr;&weierp;<em>V</em> 
</blockquote>

<p>
This <em>j</em> takes a set and regards it as a set 
of sets.
</p>

<p>
<strong>The Foundation Axiom in Algebraic Form</strong>.    Except for not being a set,
(<em>V</em>, <em>i</em>)
 is an initial algebra for  &weierp;:
for all sets <em>a</em>
 and all 
 <em>f</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;&weierp;
         <em>a</em> &rarr; <em>a</em>,
 there is a unique
 <em>s</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>V</em> &rarr; <em>f</em>
  such that
<em>m</em> 
 = 
 <em>f</em>  &sdot; &weierp;  <em>m</em>:
 </p>

</blockquote>
 

<p>
<strong>The Anti-Foundation Axiom in Coalgebraic Form</strong>.
Except for not being a set,
(<em>V</em>, <em>j</em>)
 is a final coalgebra for  &weierp;:
for every set <em>b</em>
 and every 
 <em>e</em>: <em>b</em>&rarr; 
     &weierp;<em>b</em>,
there exists a unique 
<em>s</em>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>b</em> &rarr; <em>V</em>
 such that
<em>s</em>   = &weierp; <em>s</em> &sdot; <em>e</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">

<td></td>
<td valign="bottom"><em>b</em></td>
<td align="center"><small><em>e</em></small><br />&rarr;</td>

<td align="center">&rarr;<br /><small><em>i</em></small></td>
<td valign="top">&weierp;<em>V</em></td>

</blockquote>
 
<p>
The map <em>s</em>  is called the <em>solution</em> to the <em>system</em>
<em>e</em>.
 </p>

<p>
<strong>Class forms</strong>.   We  only mentioned forms of the axioms pertaining
to sets.     They are a little nicer when
stated as axioms  on  <font face="Arial">Class</font>:
</p>

<p>
<em>FA</em> is equivalent to the assertion that 
(<em>V</em>, <em>i</em>)
 is an initial algebra for &weierp;
 on
<font face="Arial">Class</font>.
</p>

<p>
<em>AFA</em> is equivalent to the assertion that 
(<em>V</em>, <em>j</em>)
 is a final coalgebra for &weierp; on
<font face="Arial">Class</font>.
</p>

<h3><a name="4.5">4.5 Conceptual comparison</a></h3>

<p>
A chart just below  indicates a kind of  conceptual comparison 
of iterative and coiterative ideas.      
The entries towards the top are <em>dualities</em> in the categorical sense.
Moving downwards, the rows in the chart are more like research directions
than actual results.    So spelling out the details in the chart is more like
an ongoing research project than a settled matter.
</p>

<p>
For many functors on <font face="Arial">Set</font>, especially polynomial functors
and the finite power set functor, 
the initial algebra is the least fixed point together with the identity.
For the polynomial functors, this least fixed point is 
itself an algebra of terms.

<p>
The connection between greatest fixed points and final coalgebras is the
content of the following result.
</p>

<blockquote>
 <strong>Theorem [Aczel]</strong>
For every power polynomial <em>F</em> on 
<font face="Arial">Class</font>, the greatest fixed point 
together with the identity on it, (<em>F</em><sup>*</sup>, <em>id</em>),
 is a final coalgebra of <em>F</em> on 
<font face="Arial">Class</font>.
Moreover, if <em>F</em> is a polynomial functor, then 
<em>F</em><sup>*</sup> is a set, and 
 (<em>F</em><sup>*</sup>, <em>id</em>)
is a final coalgebra of <em>F</em> on <font face="Arial">Set</font>.
</blockquote>

<p>
The original result used much weaker hypotheses on <em>F</em>, 
using notions which we did not define, so 
our statement is rather weaker than in Aczel&rsquo;s book.   Several papers
have gone on to weaken strengthen this Final Coalgebra Theorem.
</p>

<p><strong>Bisimulation</strong>.
We have given the definition of bisimulation earlier,
in <a href="#3.1">Section 3.1</a>.
We discussed it in connection with graphs, but the reader may also
know of a notion with the same name coming from modal logic.
Actually, the theory of coalgebra studies a more general notion,
that of bisimulation on a coalgebra for a given functor, defined first
in Aczel and Mendler (1989).
This more general notion
specializes to several concepts which had been proposed in their own 
fields.     In addition, it is (nearly) the dual concept of a congruence on
an algebra; this explains our line in 
<a href="#chart">the conceptual comparison chart</a>.
</p>

<p><strong>Equational logic and modal logic</strong>.
A great deal of work has shown ways in which equational logic
and modal logic are &ldquo;dual&rdquo;,   but to spell this out in detail would
require quite a bit more category theory than we need in the rest
of this entry.
</p>

<p>
There is a growing field
of coalgebraic generalizations of modal logic.   For a survey of
this area, see Kurz (2006).      
</p>

<p>
The final coalgebra
of a functor may be regarded as a space of <em>complete observations</em>.
(As with all our points in this section, this statement is mainly for functors on
<font face="Arial">Set</font>, and the notion of &ldquo;complete observation&rdquo;
is, of course, merely suggestive.) For example, let 
<em>AtProp</em> be a set whose elements are
called <em>atomic propositions</em>, and consider the functor
<em>F</em>(<em>a</em>) = &weierp;<sub>fin</sub>(<em>a</em>) &times;
&weierp;(<em>AtProp</em> ).  A coalgebra for this is a set <em>a</em>
together with one map of <em>a</em> into its finite subsets, and
another map into the collection of sets of atomic propositions.
Putting the two maps together gives a <em>finitely-branching</em>
Kripke model: each point has finitely many children and some set of
atomic propositions.  Now modal logic gives us a way of
&ldquo;observing&rdquo; properties of points in coalgebras (Kripke
models).  And the record of everything that one could observe from a
point is the modal theory of that point.  Further, one may take the
collection of all theories of all points in all finitely-branching
Kripke models and make this collection (it is a set) into the carrier
of a final coalgebra for the functor.  Indeed, this would be one way
to construct a final coalgebra.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Corecursion</strong>. Returning now to 
<a href="#chart">the chart</a>, we present an example of a corecursive
definition.
 <a href="#zip">The equation for <font face="Arial">zip</font></a> 
given above shows 
 how the <font face="Arial">zip</font>  function on streams is
to work.    It should satisfy 
</p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>)    &thinsp;  = &thinsp; 
&lang;<font face="Arial">head</font>(<em>s</em>), 
 <font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>t</em>,
  <font face="Arial">tail</font>(<em>s</em>))&rang;  
  </blockquote>

<p>
Here is how <font face="Arial">zip</font>  is uniquely defined via a corecursive definition.
Write  <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup>&times;
<em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup>  as <em>S</em> in this discussion.
We want a map from <em>S</em> to <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup>. 
We are dealing with <em>S</em> as the final coalgebra of 
 the functor <em>Fa</em> = <em>N</em> &times; <em>a</em>.
 And we&rsquo;ll write the structure
 on the final coalgebra as
&lang;&thinsp;<font face="Arial">head</font>, <font face="Arial">tail</font>&amp;thinsp;&rang;, just as we did it in
<a href="#sectionstreams">Section 1.1</a>.
The idea is to turn  <em>S</em> into the carrier set
of a coalgebra for, say  (<em>S</em>, <em>f</em>). 
Then <font face="Arial">zip</font>
will be the unique coalgebra morphism from 
 (<em>S</em>, <em>f</em>) to 
 (<em>S</em>,
&lang;&thinsp;<font face="Arial">head</font>,<font face="Arial">tail</font>&thinsp;&rang; ).   
It remains to define <em>f</em>.
Let 
</p>

<blockquote>
<em>f</em>(<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>) =
&lang;<font face="Arial">head</font>(<em>s</em>),
 &lang;<em>t</em>, <font face="Arial">tail</font>(<em>s</em>)&rang;&rang; .
</blockquote>

<p>
As mentioned, by finality there is a unique 
<font face="Arial">zip</font>&thinsp;:&thinsp;<em>S</em> &rarr; <em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup> 
 so that
the diagram below commutes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="4">

<tr>
<td></td>
<td valign="bottom"><em>S</em></td>
<td align="center"><small><em>f</em></small><br />&rarr;</td>
<td valign="bottom"><em>FS</em></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><font face="Arial" size="1">zip</font></td>
<td>&darr;</td>
<td></td>
<td>&darr;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><em>F</em></small><font face="Arial" size="1">zip</font></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td></td>
<td valign="top"><em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup></td>
<td align="center">&rarr;<br />
<small>&lang;</small><font face="Arial" size="1">head</font>,<font face="Arial" size="1">tail</font><small>&rang;</small></td>
<td valign="top"><em>FN</em><sup>&infin;</sup></td>
</tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
To make sure that this works, we follow an arbitrary pair of streams,
say 
&lang;<em>s</em>,<em>t</em>&rang;  around the square, starting in the upper-left.
  Going down, we have the stream
   <font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>).
From this, the structure takes this to
&lang;<font face="Arial">head</font>(<font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>)),
 <font face="Arial">tail</font>(<font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>))&rang;
 &isin; <em>F</em><em>N</em><sup>&infin;</sup>.
But we could also take our 
&lang;<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>&rang;  across the top via <em>f</em> to get 
&lang;<font face="Arial">head</font>(<em>s</em>), 
    &lang;<em>t</em>, <font face="Arial">tail</font>(<em>s</em>)&rang;&rang;.
Now <em>F</em><font face="Arial">zip</font> applies to this pair, and
 this is where the action of <em>F</em> as a functor
enters.   We get 
&lang;<font face="Arial">head</font>(<em>s</em>),
<font face="Arial">zip</font>(<font face="Arial">tail</font>(<em>t</em>), <em>s</em>)&rang;.
So overall, we have 
</p>

<blockquote>
<font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>))  &thinsp;  = &thinsp;  
 <font face="Arial">head</font>(<em>s</em>) 
 </blockquote>
 
 <blockquote>
  <font face="Arial"> tail</font>(<font face="Arial">zip</font>(<em>s</em>, <em>t</em>)) 
   &thinsp;  = &thinsp;     
   <font face="Arial">zip</font>(<font face="Arial">tail</font>(<em>t</em>), <em>s</em>)
</blockquote>

<p>
just as desired.    It says:  to zip two streams, start with the head of the first,
and then repeat this very process on the second followed by the tail of the first.
</p>

<p>
The main point of this demonstration is that the principle of finality is 
sufficient to define and study corecursive definitions.    There are many further
developments in this area.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sets, again</strong>. We have already discussed at length the lines in the table concerning 
the Foundation and Anti-Foundation Axioms, and their attendant 
conceptual backgrounds.   The point of this section is to situate
that entire discussion inside of a larger one.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Examples of final coalgebras and corecursive definitions</strong>. 
Our conceptual comparison makes the point that algebras embody 
sets with operations.    This point is almost too easy:   
the reason behind the terminology
of  &ldquo;algebras&rdquo; in category theory is that sets with operations may be modeled
as algebras in the categorical sense.    For coalgebras, it is harder to make the
case that they directly correspond to sets with either &ldquo;transitions&rdquo; or &ldquo;observations&rdquo;.
However, we present a few examples that motivate this point.

First, for any set <em>S</em>, the functor <em>Fa</em> = <em>S</em>&times;
 <em>a</em>.    
A coalgebra for this <em>F</em> is a <em>stream system of equations</em>
as we saw it in 
<a href="#sectionstreams">Section 1.1</a>,
 except that there
we made things concrete and took <em>S</em> to be the set of natural numbers.
The final coalgebra is the set <em>S</em><sup>&infin;</sup> =  <em>S</em> &times;
  <em>S</em><sup>&infin;</sup>  of 
<em>streams over <em>S</em></em>.
   The logical language for this functor
would be a sentential  (propositional) language 
whose sentences are either <font face="Arial">true</font>  or of the form <em>s</em> : &phi;
 where <em>s</em>&isin;<em>S</em>.
The semantics would be the obvious one; for example
</p>

<blockquote>
(0, 1, 2, 3, &hellip; )  &#8872;
 0 : 1 : 2 : <font face="Arial">true</font>.
</blockquote>

<p>
One should note that  carrier of the  final coalgebra may be taken to be   
certain theories in this language.   These may be described extrinsically as
the theories of all points in all coalgebra.   It is more informative, however, to 
set down a logical system and then consider the maximal consistent sets in the system.
With the right definition, the maximal consistent sets do turn out to be the carrier of a
final coalgebra for the functor.
</p>

 <p>
Second, we consider <em>Fa</em> = (<em>S</em> &times; <em>a</em>)   + 1.
Here 1 = {0} and + is the disjoint union operation.   However, it is 
more common for people to represent the one and only element of 
1 using a symbol like <em>*</em>.
The coalgebras are like stream systems of equations, except now an
equation might ask for a stream to &ldquo;stop&rdquo; by having * on the right-hand 
side.
So an example of a coalgebra would be 
<em>x</em> &asymp; 
&lang;<em>s</em>,<em>y</em>&rang; ,
 <em>y</em> &asymp; <em>*</em>.
Then the solution would  take 
<em>x</em><sup>&dagger;</sup>  to be the one-term sequence  <em>s</em>.
The logic for this functor would be the same logic (HML) as before, except that
now we add an atomic sentence to detect the ends of finite sequences.
 </p>
 

<p>
Turning to the last two lines,  we already know that <em>AFA</em> is equivalent to
the assertion that  (<em>V</em>, <em>id</em>)
 is a final coalgebra of &weierp;; also, even without 
<em>AFA</em>, we have a final coalgebra whose carrier set is the pointed graphs modulo
bisimulation.   The logic in this case is infinitary modal logic,
actually, it is a fragment of this logic.   It turns
out that two points in a given coalgebra have the same infinitary modal theory
iff they are bisimilar.
 </p>
 
<p>
The line concerning &weierp;<sub>fin</sub>(<em>a</em>) &times;
 &weierp;(<em>AtProp</em>) is the closest to 
the Kripke semantics of modal logic.   One might hope that the final coalgebra
would turn out to be the canonical model of the modal logic 
<em>K</em>, but this is not
quite right.    One needs to cut down to those maximal consistent sets which are
realized by some point in some <em>finitely branching</em> model.
 </p>

<p>As the reader may notice, we are being extremely vague about matters
concerning the logics: is there a principled explanation of where they come from?
What, if anything,
is the relation between the final coalgebras and <em>canonical models</em>
as we find them in modal logic?  The explanations here are too long and too
involved for this entry.   Once again,
one place to start reading about these matters is Kurz (2006).
</p>
 

<p>
The lines in at the bottom of the  <a href="#chart">conceptual comparison chart</a>
 are the  most programmatic of all.
 </p>

<p><strong>Doing without <em>AFA</em>: final coalgebras
in <em>ZF</em></strong>. We mentioned in note [<a href="notes.html#note-2">2</a>] that it is possible to alter the pairing
operation in such a way that one may prove many of the results that
our treatment obtains only by using <em>ZF</em>A.  This points is
mentioned in Forster (1994) and developed in detail in Paulson (1999)
(and in other papers by Paulson). One replaces the Kuratowski pair
&lang;<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>&rang; with a variant,
({0}&times; <em>a</em>)&cup; ({1}&times; <em>b</em>).  (This is the
usual disjoint union operation, also called the <em>coproduct</em> on
sets.)  Then one defines variants of other notions: the cartesian
product, functions, etc.  And in terms of these one can indeed study
streams and infinite trees, and many other sets of interest in this
entry.  Even more, one can prove
<em>final coalgebra theorems</em>, stating sufficient conditions
for the existence of a final coalgebra whose structure is the identity.
(This is an important point for this line of work: in <em>ZF</em> we can 
show the existence of final coalgebras for the same functors as in
<em>ZFA</em>, but in the latter theory we can get final coalgebras whose
structure maps are the identity.)
</p>

<p>
One might think that this move undermines much of the interest
in <em>AFA</em>.     For Paulson, the reduction is important since he wants
to use an automatic theorem prover to work with assertions in set theory.
It makes sense to work out detailed reductions so as to avoid changing
the set theory.    </p>

<p>
Otthers may not find this conclusive, for two reasons.  First, the
method doesn&rsquo;t apply to equations like <em>x</em> =
{<em>x</em>}, or to collections like
<em>x</em> = &weierp;<sub>fin</sub>(<em>x</em>).  The latter kind of
equation is especially useful in applications.  But even more, what
will be of interest will be the whole assembly of what we might
call <em>coalgebraic concepts</em>: coinduction, corecursion, and
top-down treatments of various phenomena.  Someone who is using these
concepts and is also worried about modeling in set theory would
probably find it convenient to work with <em>AFA</em>, even if many of
the end applications could be done in standard set theory.
 </p>

<p>
To put things differently, and to ask a question that surely belongs
in this entry, why should one work with <em>AFA</em> instead
of <em>FA</em>?  Much depends on the purposes one brings to set
theoretic modeling in the first place.  For most purposes, including
most of mathematics, it makes little or no difference.  To model some
circular phenomena, it turns out to be convenient to work with final
coalgebras of various functors.  It is especially nice with the
structure maps on those final coalgebras may be taken to be the
identity function.  For example, this would allow us to say that a
stream of numbers really and truly is an ordered pair of a number and
a stream.  In this case, having <em>AFA</em> would be nice, but the
results above show that in many of the interesting cases, it is not
actually needed.  On the other hand, if one is content to work with
isomorphisms, then having the structure map be the identity is a kind
of &ldquo;optional extra&rdquo;.  Further, the question of which axiom
to adopt might appear to be besides the point.</p>

<p>
  Interested readers may consult the following supplementary
document for a discussion of how the more general ideas from coalgebra
and closely related fields help with discussions of the kinds of
mathematical circularity which we looked at previously.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
 
<p>
 This entry has two major thrusts.  First, it introduced
non-wellfounded sets and described some of the mathematics around
them.  It was not comprehensive in this regard, and one should see
Peter Aczel&rsquo;s book (1988) for much more, including
discussions of axioms besides <em>AFA</em> that we did not even mention.
One could also see Barwise and Moss (1996) for more on some of the
points that were touched on 
here.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 The presentation owes much to work in coalgebra that began
shortly after these books appeared.  So readers familiar with either
of them would still find something new in the first sections of the
entry.</p>

<p>
 The other thrust had to do with the conceptual points made in
<a href="#4.5">Section 4.5</a>.
The idea is to situate the
mathematics of set theoretic circularity inside a larger topic,
coalgebra, and then to understand both points in terms of a larger
division between &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo; and &ldquo;top-down&rdquo;
ideas.  This larger discussion is more programmatic than we would
like, and much remains to be done on it.  Our hope is that it helps
readers understand set theoretic circularity, both <em>how</em> it
works, and also <em>why</em> it is attractive.</p>

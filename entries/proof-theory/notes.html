 The term &ldquo;finit&rdquo; is used without much explanation; one is
led to think that it was a thoroughly familiar one. Indeed, the 1919
article by Bernstein calls &ldquo;finit&rdquo; all considerations that
have a constructive feature, from Kronecker through Poincar&eacute; to
Brouwer. It is obviously used also to emphasize the contrast with
&ldquo;transfinit&rdquo;. The term was also prominently used by Weyl
in <em>Das Kontinuum</em> (1918).</p>

 Induction&mdash;for quantifier-free, decidable statements&mdash;is
formulated as a rule. <em>Primitive recursion</em> is given by the
equations </p> 

\[f(x_1,\ldots, x_n,0)=g(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\] 

<p>
and </p> 

\[f(x_1,\ldots,x_n,S(x))=h(x_1,\ldots,x_n,f(x_1,\ldots,x_n,x),x)\]

<p>
where <i>S</i> is the successor function and <i>g</i>, <i>h</i> are
previously defined primitive recursive functions. The class of
primitive recursive functions is obtained from the constant 0
function, <i>S</i> and the projection functions
\(P^i_n(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=x_i\) by closure under composition and the
above recursion schema.</p>

 Many contemporary writers consider Hilbert 1922 as the beginning of
Hilbert&rsquo;s finitist program; see, for example, Franks 2009. However, Hilbert&rsquo;s
paper is split into two parts, according to the editors of the third
volume of Hilbert&rsquo;s <em>Gesammelte Abhandlungen</em> in which it
was republished: the first part stems from the older considerations
that go back to the Heidelberg talk (Hilbert 1905); see
 <a href="appendix-a.html#FormProo">appendix A.3</a>.
 In the second part a new direction is taken that involves a
significantly expanded formal theory; however, the theory is by design
&ldquo;constructive&rdquo;, as negation is applied only to equations.
A consistency proof for this expanded theory is not presented and
could not be obtained by the old techniques; the result, when suitably
restricted as the Editors of the volume suggest, can be obtained by
the methods introduced in early 1922. It is only then that the
finitist standpoint is taken.</p>

 There is a delicate evolution from &ldquo;tau&rdquo; to
&ldquo;epsilon&rdquo; that can be followed in Ewald and Sieg 2013;
here we use directly the epsilon terms.</p>

 The so-called \(\varepsilon\)-substitution method has been

 See, for detailed discussion, mathematical analysis and additional
references, Tait 2002 and Feferman &amp; Strahm 2010. A penetrating

 For a detailed descriptions of natural deduction calculi see Prawitz
1965 or Troelstra &amp; Schwichtenberg 2000. To achieve a more
symmetric treatment of negation one can replace in the above axiomatic
formulation the <em>principle of double negation</em> by the axiom
\((B\land\neg B)\to A\) (to obtain intuitionist logic) and by the axiom
\((\neg A\to (B\land\neg B))\to A\) (to obtain classical logic).</p>

 The <em>Hauptsatz</em> states informally, according to Gentzen (1934/35:
177), that every purely
logical proof can be transformed into a certain, by no means unique,
normal form. One of the essential properties of such normal proofs is
expressed by: &ldquo;It does not make detours&rdquo;.</p>

 Though the crucial paper was published only in 1958, the central
ideas of the &ldquo;Dialectica Interpreation&rdquo; go back to
lectures G&ouml;del presented at Yale in April of 1941. See G&ouml;del
1942 in volume III of his
<em>Collected Works</em>.</p>

 Both Brouwer (1927) and Zermelo (1932), from dramatically different
foundational perspectives, considered infinite proofs. Indeed, Brouwer
asserted concerning his infinite proofs: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>
These mental mathematical proofs that in general contain infinitely
many terms must not be confused with their linguistic accompaniments,
which are finite and necessarily inadequate, hence do not belong to
mathematics. (Brouwer 1927: 460, note 8).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He added that this remark contains his &ldquo;main argument against
the claims of Hilbert&rsquo;s metamathematics&rdquo;.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 &ldquo;Because of G&ouml;del&rsquo;s result consistency proofs now
require a method that is finite (or constructive) but which is
nevertheless very strong when formalized. People think this is
impossible or at least unlikely and extremely difficult. The situation
is somewhat similar to that of finding a new axiom that carries
conviction and decides the continuum hypothesis&rdquo;. (Takeuti 1975:
366)</p>

 Terms have to be of appropriate type, e.g., in (2) below, <i>t</i>
and <i>r</i> have to be of type 0 while in (3) <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>
have to be of type \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\), respectively. The required
typing should always be clear from the context.</p>

arbitrary formula. The variable <i>U</i> in \((\forall_2\rR)\) and

 In the 1970s Martin-L&ouml;f gave a normalization proof for a type
theory with a universe that contained itself. The metatheory for this
proof was basically a slight extension of the same type theory.
Ironically, it turned out that the type theory was inconsistent.</p>

 Using classical logic and just the connectives \(\land\),\(\lor\),
\(\neg\) and quantifiers \(\forall\), \(\exists\), any formula can be
re-written in such a way that the negation sign occurs only in front
of atomic formulas. A formula of the latter form is <i>P</i>-positive
if <i>P</i> does not appear negated in it.</p>

 The Hilbert project has produced three volumes of unpublished lecture
notes and material that is no longer easily accessible, for example
the original first edition of <em>Grundlagen der Geometrie</em> and
that of the 1928 book of Hilbert and Ackermann. Associated with the
edition and study of that material is also a rich secondary literature
with papers, for example, by Mancosu (1998, 1999a) and Zach (2003,
2004).</p>

 Proof-theoretic studies play an important role in areas such as
temporal and modal logics with applications to software verification.
Linear logic and the other substructural logics are being used
successfully in linguistics. Here the computational aspects of the
logics are important, and the development of proof systems for such
logics aims to find systems that are both expressive and efficient.
Our list of &ldquo;Related Entries&rdquo; below points the interested
reader to information concerning these logics and their
applications.</p>

 These four conditions correspond to the conditions \((\alpha)\)
through \((\delta)\) of \(\#71\) in Dedekind 1888; they are easily
seen to be equivalent to the so-called Peano axioms. The
<em>chain</em> of the system \(\{1\}\) (with respect to the mapping
\(\varphi\) of <b>N</b>) is the intersection of all systems that
contain 1 as an element and are closed under \(\varphi\).</p>

 In Torretti 1978 [1984: 234], for example, one finds the following
observation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&hellip; the completeness axiom is what nowadays one would call a
metamathematical statement, though one of a rather peculiar sort,
since the theory with which it is concerned includes Axiom V2 [i.e.,
the completeness axiom] itself.</p>

 In <em>On the Infinite</em> Hilbert writes retrospectively: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In particular, a contradiction discovered by Zermelo and Russell had,
when it became known, a downright catastrophic effect in the world of
mathematics. (Hilbert 1926: 375) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
More can be learnt about Hilbert&rsquo;s reaction at the time from
various reports in 1902 and 1903 (cf. Peckhaus 1990: 57).</p>

 One should keep in mind that the &ldquo;existence of sets&rdquo; was
the central issue, and it was to be guaranteed by the consistency of
an appropriate axiom system, a viewpoint shared by Poincar&eacute;.
The latter was, on the whole, impressed by Hilbert&rsquo;s novel
approach.</p>

 See Mancosu 1999b. Not only the details of <em>Principia
Mathematica</em> were of significance; on the contrary, the broad
logicist outlook had a real impact on Hilbert. Hilbert&rsquo;s notes
for a course on <em>Set Theory</em> (from the summer term 1917) and
his talk <em>Axiomatisches Denken</em> reveal a logicist direction in
his work. In the latter essay Hilbert writes: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The examination of consistency is an unavoidable task; thus, it seems
to be necessary to axiomatize logic itself and <em>to show that number
theory as well as set theory are just parts of logic</em>. (Hilbert 1918: 153).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If we try to achieve such a reduction to logic, Hilbert says at the
very end of the set theory notes, &ldquo;&hellip; we are facing one of
the most difficult problems of mathematics&rdquo;. (Hilbert 1917)</p>

 Note that <i>G</i> is, as Dawson put it (on p. 68), &ldquo;an
involved combinatorial statement expressed in the richer language of
the system of <em>Principia Mathematica</em>&rdquo; (or set theory).
It is only after the &ldquo;arithmetization of syntax&rdquo; and the
representation of the syntactic notions in elementary number theory
that <i>G</i> is turned into an arithmetical statement; section 3 of
G&ouml;del 1931a. See the remarks below from Wang 1981 concerning this
development after the K&ouml;nigsberg conference, and the further very
detailed description of how <i>G</i> is equivalent to a Diophantine
equation in section 8 of G&ouml;del&rsquo;s 1934 Princeton lectures
and in G&ouml;del 1938/9.</p>

 As to the details of their interaction, see the Introductory Notes to
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s correspondence with von Neumann and Herbrand, in
volume V of the <em>Collected Works</em>. G&ouml;del&rsquo;s contrary
perspective on the formalizability of finitist proofs is expressed not
only at the end of his 1931 paper, but also in his letters to von
Neumann and Herbrand, as well as in his contribution to the meeting of
the Schlick Circle on 15 January 1931 and in the
&ldquo;<em>Nachtrag</em>&rdquo; to his K&ouml;nigsberg remarks. In the
latter he wrote: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For a system in which all finitist (i.e., intuitionistically proper)
forms of proof are formalized, a finitist consistency proof as sought
by the formalists would be altogether impossible. However, it seems
doubtful, whether one of the systems formulated up to now, say
<em>Principia Mathematica</em>, is so comprehensive (or whether such a
comprehensive system exists at all). (G&ouml;del 1931b: 204).

 Brouwer did not include (Hyp 2) among the hypothesis. It expresses
the &ldquo;monotonicity&rdquo; of the bar. Classically it&rsquo;s
rather superfluous but intuitionistically it is essential as Kleene
observed: \(\BI_{\igen}\) formulated without (Hyp 2) yields instances
of excluded middle that are incompatible with Brouwer&rsquo;s
continuity principles (Kleene &amp; Vesley 1965: 7.14).</p>

 A bar <i>B</i> gives rise to a well-founded ordering \(\prec\) on
\(\bbN^*\) where \(t\prec s\) means that <i>t</i> is a node above
<i>s</i> and \(t\notin B\). Viewed in this way, \(\BI_{\igen}\) is a
principle of transfinite induction along \(\prec\). For the
implication \(\BI_{\igen}\to{\bCA}\) to hold it is important that
<i>B</i> can be of arbitrary complexity. Thus the moral drawable from
this is that impredicative comprehension can be deduced from
transfinite induction on impredicatively defined orderings.</p>

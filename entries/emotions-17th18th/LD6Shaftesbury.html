<h3><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
The works of Lord Shaftesbury (1671&ndash;1713) collected into the massive
volume <em>Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times</em>
(1711) present a wealth of material on the emotions. Shaftesbury&rsquo;s
aims were wholly practical: to make his readers more virtuous,
tasteful and witty inhabitants of their world. His works are not
systematic, but they are packed with observations and wonderful
one-liners, making up a genial and humorous picture of how our
emotions fit us to and in the world. And in his <em>Inquiry Concerning
Virtue and Merit</em>, Shaftesbury becomes the progenitor of the moral
sense theories of, e.g., Hutcheson and Hume, which see moral judgments
as rooted in special emotions, or &lsquo;sentiments.&rsquo; It would
be something of a misnomer to call Shaftesbury a
&lsquo;sentimentalist&rsquo; (as opposed to a
&lsquo;rationalist&rsquo;), but that is not because he fails to
appreciate the importance of the emotions to moral philosophy.</p>

<h3><a name="Ter">2. Terminology</a></h3>

<p>
Shaftesbury was particularly fond of the term &lsquo;affection,&rsquo;
using it quite broadly for the purposive responses of creatures
endowed with sense-perception to their world. He sometimes uses it
interchangeably with &lsquo;passion,&rsquo; but prefers
&lsquo;affection&rsquo; when talking about our motives for actions.
Unlike simple sense-perceptions, affections and passions can be
communicated, as when the &ldquo;panic passions&rdquo; are raised in a
multitude and passed by contact or &ldquo;sympathy&rdquo;
(<em>Enthusiasm</em> 10). Shaftesbury also uses
&lsquo;sentiment&rsquo; specifically for the affections of creatures
who have a sense of right or wrong and thus reflect upon their
feelings or affections. As reflected affections, sentiments are
closely connected to judgments.</p>

<h3><a name="NatTelAff">3. The Natural Teleology of the Affections</a></h3>

<p>
Basic to Shaftesbury&rsquo;s understanding of the affections is his
conception of the systematic and holistic structure of the world. This
conception allows him a teleological approach to considering how
individuals fit into their environment: individuals are parts, which
can be judged good or bad relative to their natural fit within that
whole, that is, to whether they promote the good of the whole. This
teleology extends to the affections and passions: indeed, &ldquo;our
business will be to examine what are the good and natural and which
the ill and unnatural affections&rdquo; (<em>Inquiry</em> 170).
Shaftesbury takes issue with Descartes for his failure to appreciate
the teleological structure of the passions, comparing Descartes to a
person who examines the material makeup of a watch without examining
its use (<em>Soliloquy</em> 131). For similar reasons, Shaftesbury has
little truck with physiological investigations of the passion,
although he does not rule out the importance of observations,
especially inward-looking ones, which can reveal the natural
purposiveness of our affections.</p>

<p>
Not surprisingly, Shaftesbury also rejects the kind of egoistic
psychology he finds in Hobbes. He argues that it is implausible even
to attempt to reduce all affections to self-interested ones, since
mere caprice is common (<em>Sensus</em> 54&ndash;5). More importantly,
Shaftesbury counts genuinely other-directed emotions among the basic
psychological make-up of humans. These are the &ldquo;natural
affections,&rdquo; although there are also self-directed and even
totally &ldquo;unnatural affections&rdquo; (e.g., <em>Inquiry</em>
196). The unnatural affections are always vicious, but the worth of
the self- and other-directed passions can vary. Some self-interested
passions can benefit, while some self-sacrificing behavior can damage
the good of the whole. Still Shaftesbury considers it part of our
psychology that what usually motivates us in ways &ldquo;inconsistent
with the interest of the species or public&rdquo; is some &ldquo;more
than ordinary self-concernment or regard to the private good&rdquo;
(<em>Inquiry</em> 170). So when we subject affections to moral
judgment, we approve most highly of the natural affections.</p>

<p>
The affections are what give us our ends, framing &ldquo;the different
notions I have of interest&rdquo; (<em>Inquiry</em> 132). The ultimate
end at which the teleological system of the passions aims is virtue,
promoting the good of the whole. Shaftesbury takes it that this end
promotes happiness too, so that virtue and interest coincide. The
<em>Inquiry Concerning Virtue and Merit</em>, however, also
understands happiness in terms of long-lasting and reliable mental
pleasures. Shaftesbury argues that indulging the natural affections is
the best way to achieve such mental pleasures, so that virtue is
inherently pleasurable, and &ldquo;virtue and interest may be found at
last to agree.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a name="AffMorPhi">4. Affections and Moral Philosophy</a></h3>

<p>
Despite taking a generally teleological approach, Shaftesbury reserves
a special place for moral evaluation and judgment in the distinctive
kinds of affections arising through reflection:</p>

<blockquote>
[T]he very actions themselves and the affections of pity, kindness,
gratitude and their contraries, being brought into the mind by
reflection, become objects. So that, by means of this reflected sense,
there arises another kind of affections towards those very affections
themselves, which have been already felt and have now become the
subject of a new liking or dislike. (<em>Inquiry</em> 172).
</blockquote>

<p>
It is the capacity for reflection that makes us capable of moral
sentiments and judgments. And what our reflected affections take as
their objects are the affections of creatures like us who are capable
of reflecting on their affections (<em>Inquiry</em> 174). For these
affections typically serve as motives for action, and it is only such
motives, i.e., the affections, that are the proper objects of moral
evaluation. So, reflected affections, or sentiments, are both the
source of our moral judgments and their objects. Those that evoke
approving moral sentiments are the other-directed, natural
affections.</p>

<h3><a name="VirHapCon">5. Virtue, Happiness and Control</a></h3>

<p>
As we have already seen, Shaftesbury uses his natural teleology to
argue for identifying virtue and interest. But he is well aware that
this will seem counter-intuitive to many readers. So, he also gives a
psychological argument based on the &ldquo;private nature, or
self-system&rdquo; for ruling out any intrinsic opposition between the
two. On the one hand, Shaftesbury admits that even the natural and
certainly the self-affections can be dysfunctional and excessive. On
the other, he argues that what will lead to the greatest happiness of
an intelligent creature is to cultivate the natural affections, along
with a due proportion of self-affections. Quite generally, Shaftesbury
takes it that &ldquo;our chief means and power of
self-enjoyment&rdquo; lies in having &ldquo;the natural, kindly, or
generous affections strong and powerful towards the good of the
public&rdquo; (<em>Inquiry</em> 200). Indeed, he concludes the
<em>Inquiry Concerning Virtue and Merit</em> by arguing that the
evidence identifying the superior mental enjoyments with the natural
affections is &ldquo;as great as that which is found in numbers or
mathematics,&rdquo; since it survives even in the face of doubts about
the existence of the external world (<em>Inquiry</em> 229). Skepticism
cannot touch our affections and pleasures, which are always
accessible. Moreover, those of our pleasures that are mental lie fully
within our control, and so presumably does the cultivation of the
natural affections. In this way, Shaftesbury offers a picture of
character formation through a voluntary ordering of our affections, in
which the most publicly-directed one becomes the
&ldquo;master-pleasure and conqueror of the rest&rdquo;
(<em>Inquiry</em> 202).</p>

<h3><a name="AffAesEva">6. Affections and Aesthetic Evaluation</a></h3>

<p>
Shaftesbury often compares our moral sentiments to our aesthetic
evaluations, even going so far as to identify proper taste in morals
and proper taste in aesthetics. This is no mere analogy: both use much
the same capacity and respond to much the same features of the world.
Like moral judgments, judgments of beauty rest on the perception of
the natural fitness of things. We make the judgments through our
affections, but their objects exist independently of the affections.
The world, then, provides a standard for our aesthetic affections and
judgments, and the cultivation of taste is a matter of developing
proper responses to that standard.</p>

<p>
Our aesthetic sense is comparable to our moral sense not only because
they both require mobilizing affections, but because they both require
reflection on our affections. Speaking of how a new kind of affection
arises through reflection, Shaftesbury declares, &ldquo;the case is
the same in the mental or moral subjects as in the ordinary bodies or
common subjects of sense&rdquo; (<em>Inquiry</em> 172). But whereas
reflected affections are themselves the object of the reflected
affections of moral judgment, it is &ldquo;ordinary bodies, or common
subjects of sense&rdquo; that are the objects of aesthetic
affections.</p>

<h3><a name="InfLatAut">7. Influences on Later Authors</a></h3>

<p>
Shaftesbury&rsquo;s vision of the harmony between the good of the
individual and the good of the whole was opposed by his
near-contemporary Bernard Mandeville. Mandeville&rsquo;s <em>Fable of
the Bees, or Private Vices, Public Benefits</em> (1714) portrayed our
passions as self-directed desires, reducible either to
&ldquo;self-love&rdquo; or to &ldquo;self-liking.&rdquo; Indulging
them might indeed promote commerce and economic flourishing, but was
incompatible with personal virtue. Remarks Mandeville added in 1723
called Shaftesbury out by name, declaring &ldquo;that two Systems
cannot be more opposite than his Lordship&rsquo;s and mine&rdquo;
(<em>Fable</em> vol. 1, 324, orig. p. 372). Mandeville took
Shaftesbury&rsquo;s view to be an oddity (<em>Fable</em> vol. 1, 323,
orig. p. 371), but it proved more popular than his own, particularly
among &lsquo;sentimentalist&rsquo; moral philosophers. Hutcheson, in
particular, defended Shaftesbury and adopted his conception of our
moral sense and its links with the aesthetic sense. So did Hume,
albeit more ambivalently, while other elements of his thought bore
fruit in the &lsquo;rationalist&rsquo; moral philosophy of, e.g.,
Joseph Butler. Shaftesbury&rsquo;s arguments against the view that our
emotions are basically egoistic were repeated by philosophers of both
stripes, including Hutcheson and Hume. His influence was also felt in
French and British aesthetic theory. In general, Shaftesbury set the
terms of approach to sentiments for the next generation of British and
French authors.</p>

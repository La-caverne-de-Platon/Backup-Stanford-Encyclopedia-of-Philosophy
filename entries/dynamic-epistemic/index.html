<h2 id="Intr">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
Dynamic Epistemic Logic is the study of a family of modal logics, each
of which is obtained from a given logical language by adding one or
more modal operators that describe model-transforming actions. If
\([A]\) is such a modality, then new formulas of the form \([A]F\) are
used to express the statement that <i>F</i> is true after the
occurrence of action <i>A</i>. To determine whether \([A]F\) is true
at a pointed Kripke model \((M,w)\) (see
 <a href="appendix-A-kripke.html">Appendix A</a>
 for definitions), we transform the current Kripke model <i>M</i>
according to the prescription of action <i>A</i> and we obtain a new
pointed Kripke model \((M',w')\) at which we then investigate whether
<i>F</i> is true. If it is true there, then we say that original
formula \([A]F\) is true in our starting situation \((M,w)\). If
<i>F</i> is not true in the newly produced situation \((M',w')\), then
we conclude the opposite: \([A]F\) is not true in our starting
situation \((M,w)\). In this way, we obtain the meaning of \([A]F\)
not by the analysis of what obtains in a single Kripke model but by
the analysis of what obtains as a result of a specific
modality-specified Kripke model transformation. This is a shift from a
<em>static</em> semantics of truth that takes place in an individual
Kripke model to a <em>dynamic</em> semantics of truth that takes place
across modality-specified Kripke model transformations. The advantage
of the dynamic perspective is that we can analyze the epistemic and
doxastic consequences of actions such as public and private
announcements without having to &ldquo;hard wire&rdquo; the results
into the model from the start. Furthermore, we may look at the
consequences of different sequences of actions simply by changing the
sequence of action-describing modalities. </p>

<p>
In the following sections, we will look at the many model-changing
actions that have been studied in Dynamic Epistemic Logic. Many
natural applications and questions arise as part of this study, and we
will see some of the results obtained in this work. Along the way it
will be convenient to consider many variations of the general formal
setup described above. Despite these differences, at the core is the
same basic idea: new modalities describing certain
application-specific model-transforming operations are added to an
existing logical language and the study proceeds from there.
Proceeding now ourselves, we begin with what is perhaps the
quintessential and most basic model-transforming operation: the public
announcement. </p>

<h2 id="PublComm">2. Public communication</h2>

<h3 id="PublAnnoLogi">2.1 Public Announcement Logic</h3>

<p>
Public Announcement Logic (PAL) is the modal logic study of knowledge,
belief, and public communication. PAL (pronounced &ldquo;pal&rdquo;)
is used to reason about knowledge and belief and the changes brought
about in knowledge and belief as per the occurrence of completely
trustworthy, truthful announcements. PAL&rsquo;s most common
motivational examples include the <em>Muddy Children Puzzle</em> and
the <em>Sum and Product Puzzle</em> (see, e.g., Plaza 1989, 2007). The
<em>Cheryl&rsquo;s Birthday</em> problem, which became a sensation on
the Internet in April 2015, can also be addressed using PAL. Here we
present a version of the Cheryl&rsquo;s Birthday problem due to Chang
(2015, 15 April) and a three-child version of the Muddy Children
Puzzle (Fagin et al. 1995). Instead of presenting the traditional Sum
and Product Puzzle (see Plaza (1989, 2007) for details), we present
our own simplification that we call the <em>Sum and Least Common
Multiple Problem</em>. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Cheryl&rsquo;s Birthday (version of Chang (2015, 15
April)).</strong> Albert and Bernard just met Cheryl.
&ldquo;When&rsquo;s your birthday?&rdquo; Albert asked Cheryl.</p>

<p>
Cheryl thought a second and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to tell
you, but I&rsquo;ll give you some clues&rdquo;. She wrote down a list
of 10 dates:</p>

<ul>

<li>May 15, May 16, May 19</li>

<li>June 17, June 18</li>

<li>July 14, July 16</li>

<li>August 14, August 15, August 17</li>
</ul>

<p>
&ldquo;My birthday is one of these&rdquo;, she said.</p>

<p>
Then Cheryl whispered in Albert&rsquo;s ear the month&mdash;and only
the month&mdash;of her birthday. To Bernard, she whispered the day,
and only the day.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you figure it out now?&rdquo; she asked Albert.</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li>Albert: I don&rsquo;t know when your birthday is, but I know
Bernard doesn&rsquo;t know either.</li>

<li>Bernard: I didn&rsquo;t know originally, but now I do.</li>

<li>Albert: Well, now I know too!</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
When is Cheryl&rsquo;s birthday?</p>
</div>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>The Muddy Children Puzzle.</strong> Three children are playing
in the mud. Father calls the children to the house, arranging them in
a semicircle so that each child can clearly see every other child.
&ldquo;At least one of you has mud on your forehead&rdquo;, says
Father. The children look around, each examining every other
child&rsquo;s forehead. Of course, no child can examine his or her
own. Father continues, &ldquo;If you know whether your forehead is
dirty, then step forward now&rdquo;. No child steps forward. Father
repeats himself a second time, &ldquo;If you know whether your
forehead is dirty, then step forward now&rdquo;. Some but not all of
the children step forward. Father repeats himself a third time,
&ldquo;If you know whether your forehead is dirty, then step forward
now&rdquo;. All of the remaining children step forward. How many
children have muddy foreheads?</p>
</div>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>The Sum and Least Common Multiple Puzzle.</strong> Referee
reminds Mr. S and Mr. L that the least common multiple
(&ldquo;\(\text{lcm}\)&rdquo;) of two positive integers <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> is the smallest positive integer that is divisible without
any remainder by both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> (e.g.,
\(\text{lcm}(3,6)=6\) and \(\text{lcm}(5,7)=35\)). Referee then says,
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Among the integers ranging from \(2\) to \(7\), including \(2\) and
\(7\) themselves, I will choose two different numbers. I will whisper
the sum to Mr. S and the least common multiple to Mr. L. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Referee then does as promised. The following dialogue then takes
place:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li>Mr. S: I know that you don&rsquo;t know the numbers.</li>

<li>Mr. L: Ah, but now I do know them.</li>

<li>Mr. S: And so do I!</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
What are the numbers?</p>
</div>

<p>
The Sum and Product Puzzle is like the Sum and Least Common Multiple
Puzzle except that the allowable integers are taken in the range
\(2,\dots,100\) (inclusive), Mr. L is told the product of the two
numbers (instead of their least common multiple), and the dialogue is
altered slightly (L: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know the numbers&rdquo;, S:
&ldquo;I knew you didn&rsquo;t know them&rdquo;, L: &ldquo;Ah, but now
I do know them&rdquo;, S: &ldquo;And now so do I!&rdquo;). These
changes result in a substantially more difficult problem. See Plaza
(1989, 2007) for details. </p>

<p>
The reader is advised to try solving the puzzles himself or herself
and to read more about PAL below before looking at the PAL-based
solutions found in a
 <a href="appendix-B-solutions.html">Appendix B</a>.
 Later, after the requisite basics of PAL have been presented, the
authors will again point the reader to this appendix. </p>

<p>
There are many variations of these puzzles, some of which motivate
logics that can handle more than just public communication.
Restricting attention to the variations above, we note that a formal
logic for reasoning about these puzzles must be able to represent
various agents&rsquo; knowledge along with changes in this knowledge
that are brought about as a result of public announcements. One
important thing to note is that the announcements in the puzzles are
all <em>truthful</em> and <em>completely trustworthy</em>: so that we
can solve the puzzles, we tacitly assume (among other things) that
everything that is announced is in fact true and that all agents
accept the content of a public announcement without question. These
assumptions are of course unrealistic in many everyday situations,
and, to be sure, there are more sophisticated Dynamic Epistemic Logics
that can address more complicated and nuanced attitudes agents may
have with respect to the information they receive. Nevertheless, in an
appropriately restricted situation, Public Announcement Logic provides
a basic framework for reasoning about truthful, completely trustworthy
public announcements. </p>

<p>
Given a nonempty set \(\sP\) of propositional letters and a finite
nonempty set \(\sA\) of agents, the basic modal language \eqref{ML} is
defined as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{gather*}
F  \ccoloneqq p \mid F \wedge F \mid \neg F \mid [a]F \\
 \small p \in \sP,\; a \in \sA
\taglabel{ML}
\end{gather*}\]

<p>
Formulas \([a]F\) are assigned a reading that is doxastic
(&ldquo;agent <i>a</i> believes <i>F</i>&rdquo;) or epistemic
(&ldquo;agent <i>a</i> knows <i>F</i>&rdquo;), with the particular
reading depending on the application one has in mind. In this article
we will use both readings interchangeably, choosing whichever is more
convenient in a given context. In the language \eqref{ML}, Boolean
connectives other than negation \(\lnot\) and conjunction \(\land\)
are taken as abbreviations in terms of negation in conjunction as is
familiar from any elementary Logic textbook. See
 <a href="appendix-A-kripke.html">Appendix A</a>
 for further details on \eqref{ML} and its Kripke semantics. </p>

<p>
The language \(\eqref{PAL}\) of Public Announcement Logic extends the
basic modal language \eqref{ML} by adding formulas \([F!]G\) to
express that &ldquo;after the public announcement of <i>F</i>, formula
<i>G</i> is true&rdquo;: </p> 

\[\begin{gather*}
F \ccoloneqq p \mid F \wedge F \mid \neg F \mid [a]F \mid [F!]F \\
 \small p \in \sP,\; a \in \sA
\taglabel{PAL}
\end{gather*}\]

<p>
Semantically, the formula \([F!]G\) is interpreted in a Kripke model
as follows: to say that \([F!]G\) is true means that, whenever
<i>F</i> is true, <i>G</i> is true after we eliminate all not-<i>F</i>
possibilities (and all arrows to and from these possibilities). This
makes sense: since the public announcement of <i>F</i> is completely
trustworthy, all agents respond by collectively eliminating all
non-<i>F</i> possibilities from consideration. So to see what obtains
after a public announcement of <i>F</i> occurs, we eliminate the
non-<i>F</i> worlds and then see what is true in the resulting
situation. Formally, \(\eqref{PAL}\)-formulas are evaluated as an
extension of the binary truth relation \(\models\) between pointed
Kripke models and \eqref{ML}-formulas (defined in
 <a href="appendix-A-kripke.html">Appendix A</a>)
 as follows: given a Kripke model \(M=(W,R,V)\) and a world \(w\in
W\), </p>

<ul>

<li>\(M,w\models p\) holds if and only if \(w\in V(p)\);</li>

<li>\(M,w\models F\land G\) holds if and only if both \(M,w\models F\)
and \(M,w\models G\);</li>

<li>\(M,w\models\lnot F\) holds if and only if \(M,w\not\models
F\);</li>

<li>\(M,w\models[a]F\) holds if and only if \(M,v\models F\) for each
<i>v</i> satisfying \(wR_av\); and</li>

<li>\(M,w \models [F!]G\) holds if and only if we have that \(M,w
\not\models F\) or that \(M[F!],w \models G\), where the model

\[
M[F!] = (W[F!],R[F!],V[F!])
\]

 is defined by:

<ul>

<li> \(W[F!] \coloneqq \{ v \in W \mid M,v \models F\}\) &mdash;
retain only the worlds where <i>F</i> is true, </li>

<li> \(xR[F!]_ay\) if and only if \(xR_ay\) &mdash; leave arrows
between remaining worlds unchanged, and </li>

<li> \(v \in V[F!](p)\) if an only if \(v \in V(p)\) &mdash; leave the
valuation the same at remaining worlds. </li>
</ul> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that the formula \([F!]G\) is vacuously true if <i>F</i> is
false: the announcement of a false formula is inconsistent with our
assumption of truthful announcements, and hence every formula follows
after a falsehood is announced (<em>ex falso quodlibet</em>). It is
worth remarking that the dual announcement operator \(\may{F!}\)
defined by </p> 

\[ \may{F!}G \coloneqq \neg[F!]\neg G \] 

<p>
gives the formula \(\may{F!} G\) the following meaning: <i>F</i> is
true and, after <i>F</i> is announced, <i>G</i> is also true. In
particular, we observe that the announcement formula \(\may{F!} G\) is
false whenever <i>F</i> is false. </p>

<p>
Often one wishes to restrict attention to a class of Kripke models
whose relations \(R_a\) satisfy certain desirable properties such as
reflexivity, transitivity, Euclideanness, or seriality. Reflexivity
tells us that agent knowledge is truthful, transitivity tells us that
agents know what they know, Euclideanness tells us that agents know
what they do not know, and seriality tells us that agent knowledge is
consistent. (A belief reading is also possible.) In order to study
public announcements over such classes, we must be certain that the
public announcement of a formula <i>F</i> does not transform a given
Kripke model <i>M</i> into a new model \(M[F!]\) that falls outside of
the class. The following theorem indicates when it is that a given
class of Kripke models is &ldquo;closed&rdquo; under public
announcements (meaning a public announcement performed on a model in
the class always yields another model in the class). </p>

<p>
See
 <a href="appendix-C-relations.html">Appendix C</a>
 for the definition of reflexivity, transitivity, Euclideanness,
seriality, and other important relational properties. </p>

<p>
<strong>Public Announcement Closure Theorem.</strong> Let
\(M=(W,R,V)\) be a Kripke model and <i>F</i> be a formula true at at
least one world in <i>W</i>.</p>

<ul>

<li> If \(R_a\) is reflexive, then so is \(R[F!]_a\). </li>

<li> If \(R_a\) is transitive, then so is \(R[F!]_a\). </li>

<li> If \(R_a\) is Euclidean, then so is \(R[F!]_a\). </li>

<li> If \(R_a\) is serial and Euclidean, then so is
\(R[F\land\bigwedge_{x\in\sA}\may{x} F!]_a\). </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The Public Announcement Closure Theorem tells us that reflexivity,
transitivity, and Euclideanness are always closed under the public
announcement operation. Seriality is in general not; however, if
seriality comes with Euclideanness, then public announcements of
formulas of the form \(F\land\bigwedge_{x\in\sA}\may{x} F\) (read,
&ldquo;<i>F</i> is true and consistent with each agent&rsquo;s
knowledge&rdquo;) preserve both seriality and Euclideanness.
Therefore, if we wish to study classes of models that are serial,
then, to make use of the above theorem, we will need to further
restrict to models that are both serial and Euclidean and we will need
to restrict the language of public announcements so that all
announcement formulas have this form. (One could also restrict to
another form, so long as public announcements of this form preserve
seriality over some class \(\sC\) of serial models.) Restricting the
language \eqref{PAL} by requiring that public announcements have the
form \(F\land\bigwedge_{x\in\sA}\may{x} F\) leads to the language
\eqref{sPAL} of <em>serial</em> Public Announcement Logic, which we
may use when interested in serial and Euclidean Kripke models. </p>

\[\begin{gather*}
F  \ccoloneqq p \mid F \wedge F \mid \neg F \mid [a]F \mid [F\land\bigwedge_{x\in\sA}\may{x} F!]F\\
\small p \in \sP,\; a \in \sA
\taglabel{sPAL}
\end{gather*}\]

<p>
Given a class of Kripke models satisfying certain properties and a
modal logic \(\L\) in the language \eqref{ML} that can reason about
that class, we would like to construct a Public Announcement Logic
whose soundness and completeness are straightforwardly proved. To do
this, we would like to know in advance that \(\L\) is sound and
complete with respect to the class of models in question, that some
public announcement extension \(\LPAL\) of the language \eqref{ML}
(e.g., the language \eqref{sPAL} or maybe even \eqref{PAL} itself)
will include announcements that do not spoil closure, and that there
is an easy way for us to determine the truth of \(\LPAL\)-formulas by
looking only the underlying modal language \eqref{ML}. This way, we
can &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; completeness of the public announcement
theory to the completeness of the basic modal theory \(\L\). We call
such theories for which this is possible <em>PAL-friendly</em>. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>PAL-friendly theory.</strong> To say that a logic \(\L\) is
<em>PAL-friendly</em> means we have the following:</p>

<ul>

<li> \(\L\) is a normal multi-modal logic in the language \eqref{ML}
(i.e., with modals \([a]\) for each agent \(a\in\sA\)), </li>

<li> there is a class of Kripke models \(\sC\) such that \(\L\) is
sound and complete with respect to the collection of pointed Kripke
models based on models in \(\sC\), and </li>

<li> there is a language \(\LPAL\) (the &ldquo;announcement extension
of \(\L\)&rdquo;) obtained from \eqref{PAL} by restricting the form of
public announcement modals \([F!]\) such that \(\sC\) is closed under
public announcements of this form (i.e., performing a public
announcement of this form on a model in \(\sC\) having at least one
world at which the announced formula is true yields another model in
\(\sC\)). </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
See
 <a href="appendix-D-normal-ML.html">Appendix D</a>
 for the exact meaning of the first component of a PAL-friendly
theory. </p>

<p>
Examples of PAL-friendly theories include the common &ldquo;logic of
belief&rdquo; (multi-modal \(\mathsf{KD45}\)), the common &ldquo;logic
of knowledge&rdquo; (multi-modal \(\mathsf{S5}\)), multi-modal
\(\mathsf{K}\), multi-modal \(\mathsf{T}\), multi-modal
\(\mathsf{S4}\), and certain logics that mix modal operators of the
previously mentioned types (e.g., \(\mathsf{S5}\) for \([a]\) and
\(\mathsf{T}\) for all other agent modal operators \([b]\)). Fixing a
PAL-friendly theory \(\L\), we easily obtain an axiomatic theory of
public announcement logic based on \(\L\) as follows. </p>

<div class="indent" id="PAL-theory">

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt">
<strong>The axiomatic theory \(\PAL\).</strong></p>

<ul>

<li> Axiom schemes and rules for the PAL-friendly theory \(\L\) </li>

<li> Reduction axioms (all in the language \(\LPAL\)):

<ol>

<li> \( [F!]p \leftrightarrow (F\to p) \) for letters \(p\in\sP\)
<br />
&ldquo;After a false announcement, every letter holds&mdash;a
contradiction. After a true announcement, letters retain their truth
values.&rdquo; </li>

<li> \([F!](G\land H)\leftrightarrow([F!]G\land[F!]H)\)
<br />
&ldquo;A conjunction is true after an announcement iff each conjunct
is.&rdquo; </li>

<li> \([F]\lnot G\leftrightarrow(F\to\lnot[F!]G)\)
<br />
&ldquo;<i>G</i> is false after an announcement iff the announcement,
whenever truthful, does not make <i>G</i> true.&rdquo; </li>

<li> \([F!][a]G \leftrightarrow (F\to[a][F!]G)\)
<br />
&ldquo;<i>a</i> knows <i>G</i> after an announcement iff the
announcement, whenever truthful, is known by <i>a</i> to make <i>G</i>
true.&rdquo; </li>
</ol> </li>

<li> Announcement Necessitation Rule: from <i>G</i>, infer \([F!]G\)
whenever the latter is in \(\LPAL\).
<br />
&ldquo;A validity holds after any announcement.&rdquo; </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
The reduction axioms characterize truth of an announcement formula
\([F!]G\) in terms of the truth of other announcement formulas
\([F!]H\) whose post-announcement formula <i>H</i> is less complex
than the original post-announcement formula <i>G</i>. In the case
where <i>G</i> is just a propositional letter <i>p</i>, Reduction
Axiom 1 says that the truth of \([F!]p\) can be reduced to a formula
not containing any announcements of <i>F</i>. So we see that the
reduction axioms &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; statements of truth of
complicated announcements to statements of truth of simpler and
simpler announcements until the mention of announcements is not
necessary. For example, writing the reduction axiom used in a
parenthetical subscript, we have the following sequence of provable
equivalences: </p> 

\[
\begin{array}{ll}
&amp; [[b]p!](p\land[a]p) \\
\leftrightarrow_{(2)} &amp; [[b]p!]p\land[[b]p!][a]p\\
\leftrightarrow_{(1)} &amp; ([b]p\to p)\land[[b]p!][a]p\\
\leftrightarrow_{(4)} &amp; ([b]p\to p)\land([b]p\to[a][[b]p!]p)\\
\leftrightarrow_{(1)} &amp; ([b]p\to p)\land([b]p\to[a]([b]p\to p))
\end{array}
\]

<p>
Notice that the last formula does not contain public announcements.
Hence we see that the reduction axioms allow us to express the truth
of the announcement-containing formula \([[b]p!](p\land[a]p)\) in
terms of a provably equivalent announcement-free formula. This is true
in general. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>\(\PAL\) Reduction Theorem.</strong> Given a PAL-friendly
theory \(\L\), every <i>F</i> in the language \(\LPAL\) of Public
Announcement Logic (without common knowledge) is \(\PAL\)-provably
equivalent to a formula \(F^\circ\) coming from the announcement-free
fragment of \(\LPAL\).</p>
</div>

<p>
The Reduction Theorem makes proving completeness of the axiomatic
theory with respect to the appropriate class of pointed Kripke models
easy: since every \(\LPAL\)-formula can all be expressed using a
provably equivalent announcement-free \eqref{ML}-formula, completeness
of the theory \(\PAL\) follows by the Reduction Theorem, the soundness
of \(\PAL\), and the known completeness of the underlying modal theory
\(\L\). </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>\(\PAL\) Soundness and Completeness.</strong> \(\PAL\) is
sound and complete with respect to the collection \(\sC_*\) of pointed
Kripke models for which the underlying PAL-friendly theory \(\L\) is
sound and complete. That is, for each \(\LPAL\)-formula <i>F</i>, we
have that \(\PAL\vdash F\) if and only if \(\sC_*\models F\).</p>
</div>

<p>
One interesting \(\PAL\)-derivable scheme (available if allowed by the
language \(\LPAL\)) is the following: </p> 

\[
[F!][G!]H \leftrightarrow [F\land[F!]G!]H
\]

<p>
This says that two consecutive announcements can be combined into a
single announcement: to announce that <i>F</i> is true and then to
announce that <i>G</i> is true will have the same result as announcing
the single statement that &ldquo;<i>F</i> is true and, after <i>F</i>
is announced, <i>G</i> is true&rdquo;. </p>

<p>
We conclude with a few complexity results for Public Announcement
Logic. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>PAL Complexity.</strong> Let \(\sC\) be the class of all

<ul>

<li> The satisfiability problem for single-agent \eqref{PAL} over

<p>
One thing to note about the theory \(\PAL\) as presented above is that
it is parameterized on a PAL-friendly logic \(\L\). Therefore,
&ldquo;Public Announcement Logic&rdquo; as an area of study in fact
encompasses a wide-ranging family individual Public Announcement
Logics, one for each instance of \(\L\). Unless otherwise noted, the
results and concepts we present apply to all logics within this
family. </p>

In
 <a href="appendix-E-PAL.html">Appendix E</a>,
 we detail further aspects of Public Announcement Logic: schematic
validity, expressivity and succinctness, Gerbrandy&ndash;Groeneveld
announcements, consistency-preserving announcements and Arrow Update
Logic, and quantification over public announcements in Arbitrary
Public Announcement Logic. </p>

<p>
While iterated public announcements seem like a natural operation to
consider (motivated by, e.g., the Muddy Children Puzzle), Miller and
Moss (2005) showed that a logic of such a language cannot be
recursively axiomatized. </p>

<h3 id="GrouKnowCommKnowDistKnow">2.2 Group knowledge: common knowledge and distributed knowledge</h3>

<h4 id="CommKnow">2.2.1 Common knowledge</h4>

<p>
To reason about common knowledge and public announcements, we add the
common knowledge operators \([B*]\) to the language for each group of
agents \(B\subseteq\sA\). The formula \([B*]F\) is read, &rdquo;it is
common knowledge among the group <i>B</i> that <i>F</i> is
true&rdquo;. We define the language \eqref{PAL+C} of <em>public
announcement logic with common knowledge</em> as follows: </p>

\[\begin{gather*}
F  \ccoloneqq p \mid F \wedge F \mid \neg F \mid [a]F \mid [F!]F \mid [B*]F \\
 \small p \in \sP,\; a \in \sA,\; B\subseteq\sA
\taglabel{PAL+C}
\end{gather*}\]

<p>
The semantics of this language over pointed Kripke models is defined
in
 <a href="appendix-A-kripke.html">Appendix A</a>.
 We recall two key defined expressions: </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\([B]F\) denotes \(\bigwedge_{a\in B}[a]F\) &mdash; &ldquo;everyone in
group <i>B</i> knows (or believes) <i>F</i>&rdquo;;</p>

<p>
\([C]F\) denotes \([\sA*]F\) &mdash; &ldquo;it is common knowledge (or
belief) that <i>F</i> is true.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>
For convenience in what follows, we will adopt the epistemic (i.e.,
knowledge) reading of formulas in the remainder of this subsection. In
particular, using the language \eqref{PAL+C}, we are able to provide a
formal sense in which public announcements bring about common
knowledge. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Theorem.</strong> For each pointed Kripke model \((M,w)\), we
have:</p>

<ul>

<li> \(M,w\models[p!][C]p\) for each propositional letter \(p\in\sP\).

&ldquo;A propositional letter becomes common knowledge after it is

<strong>\(\PALC\) Soundness and Completeness (Baltag, Moss, and
Solecki 1998, 1999; see also van Ditmarsch, van der Hoek, and Kooi
2007).</strong> \(\PALC\) is sound and complete with respect to the
collection \(\sC_*\) of pointed Kripke models for which the underlying
public announcement logic \(\PAL\) is sound and complete. That is, for
each \eqref{PAL+C}-formula <i>F</i>, we have that \(\PALC\vdash F\) if
and only if \(\sC_*\models F\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Unlike the proof of completeness for the logic \(\PAL\) without common
knowledge, the proof for the logic \(\PALC\) with common knowledge
does not proceed by way of a reduction theorem. This is because adding
common knowledge to the language strictly increases the expressivity.
</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Theorem (Baltag, Moss, and Solecki 1998, 1999; see also van
Ditmarsch, van der Hoek, and Kooi 2007).</strong> Over the class of
all pointed Kripke models, the language \eqref{PAL+C} of public
announcement logic with common knowledge is strictly more expressive
than language \eqref{PAL} without common knowledge. In particular, the
\eqref{PAL+C}-formula \([p!][C]q\) cannot be expressed in \eqref{PAL}
with respect to the class of all pointed Kripke models: for every
\eqref{PAL}-formula <i>F</i> there exists a pointed Kripke model
\((M,w)\) such that \(M,w\not\models F\leftrightarrow[p!][C]q\).</p>
</div>

<p>
This result rules out the possibility of a reduction theorem for
\(\PALC\): we cannot find a public announcement-free equivalent of
every \eqref{PAL+C}-formula. This led van Benthem, van Eijck, and Kooi
(2006) to develop a common knowledge-like operator for which a
reduction theorem does hold. The result is the binary <em>relativized
common knowledge</em> operator \([B*](F|G)\), which is read,
&ldquo;<i>F</i> is common knowledge among group <i>B</i> relative to
the information that <i>G</i> is true&rdquo;. The language \eqref{RCK}
of relativized common knowledge is given by the following grammar:
</p> 

\[\begin{gather*}
F  \ccoloneqq 
p \mid F \wedge F \mid \neg F \mid [a]F \mid [F!]F \mid [B*](F|F) \\
\small p \in \sP,\; a \in \sA,\; B\subseteq\sA
\taglabel{RCK}
\end{gather*}\]

<p>
and the language \eqref{RCK+P} of relativized common knowledge with
public announcements is obtained by adding public announcements to
\eqref{RCK}: </p> 

\[\begin{gather*}
F  \ccoloneqq 
p \mid F \wedge F \mid \neg F \mid [a]F \mid [F!]F \mid [B*](F|F) \mid [F!]F \\
 \small p \in \sP,\; a \in \sA,\; B\subseteq\sA
\taglabel{RCK+P}
\end{gather*}\]

<p>
The semantics of \eqref{RCK} is an extension of the semantics of
\eqref{ML}, and the semantics of \eqref{RCK+P} is an extension of the
semantics of \eqref{PAL}. In each case, the extension is obtained by
adding the following inductive truth clause: </p>

<ul>

<li> \(M,w\models[B*](F|G)\) holds if and only if \(M,v\models F\) for
each <i>v</i> satisfying \(w(R[G!]_B)^*v\) </li>
</ul>

<p>
Here we recall that \(R[G!]\) is the function that obtains after the
public announcement of <i>G</i>; that is, we have \(xR[G!]_ay\) if and
only if <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are in the model after the announcement
of <i>G</i> (i.e., \(M,w\models G\) and \(M,y\models G\)) and there is
an <i>a</i>-arrow from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i> in the original model
(i.e., \(xR_ay\)). The relation \(R[G!]_B\) is then the union of the
relations for those agents in <i>B</i>; that is, we have \(xR[G!]_By\)
if and only if there is an \(a\in B\) with \(xR[G!]_ay\). Finally,
\((R[G!]_B)^*\) is the reflexive-transitive closure of the relation
\(R[G!]_B\); that is, we have \(x(R[G!]_B)^*y\) if and only if \(x=y\)
or there is a finite sequence </p> 

\[
x\,R[G!]_B\,z_1\,R[G!]_B\cdots R[G!]_B\,z_n\,R[G!]_B\,y
\]

<p>
of \(R[G!]_B\)-arrows connecting <i>x</i> to <i>y</i>. So, all
together, the formula \([B*](F|G)\) is true at <i>w</i> if and only if
an <i>F</i>-world is at the end of every finite path (of length zero
or greater) that begins at <i>w</i>, contains only <i>G</i>-worlds,
and uses only arrows for agents in <i>B</i>. Intuitively, this says
that if the agents in <i>B</i> commonly assume <i>G</i> is true in
jointly entertaining possible alternatives to the given state of
affairs <i>w</i>, then, relative to this assumption, <i>F</i> is
common knowledge among those in <i>B</i>. </p>

<p>
As observed by van Benthem, van Eijck, and Kooi (2006), relativized
common knowledge is not the same as non-relativized common knowledge
after an announcement. For example, over the collection of all pointed
Kripke models, the following formulas are not equivalent: </p>

<ul>

<li> \(\lnot[\{a,b\}*]([a]p\mid p)\) &mdash; &ldquo;it is not the case
that, relative to <i>p</i>, it is common knowledge among <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i> that <i>a</i> knows <i>p</i>.&rdquo; </li>

<li> \([p!]\lnot[\{a,b\}*][a]p\) &mdash; &ldquo;after <i>p</i> is
announced, it is not the case that it is common knowledge among
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> that <i>a</i> knows <i>p</i>.&rdquo; </li>
</ul>

<p>
In particular, in the pointed model \((M,w)\) pictured in Figure 1,
the formula \(\lnot[\{a,b\}*]([a]p\mid p)\) is true because there is a
path that begins at <i>w</i>, contains only <i>p</i>-worlds, uses only
arrows in \(\{a,b\}\), and ends on the \(\lnot[a]p\)-world <i>u</i>.

</div>

<p>
However, the formula \([p!]\lnot[\{a,b\}*][a]p\) is false at \((M,w)\)
because, after the announcement of <i>p</i>, the model \(M[p!]\)
pictured in Figure 2 obtains, and all worlds in this model are
\([a]p\)-worlds. In fact, whenever <i>p</i> is true, the formula
\([p!]\lnot[\{a,b\}*][a]p\) is <em>always</em> false: after the
announcement of <i>p</i>, all that remains are <i>p</i>-worlds, and
therefore every world is an \([a]p\)-world. </p>

In the remainder of the article, unless otherwise stated, we will
generally assume that we are working with languages that do not
contain common knowledge or relativized common knowledge. </p>

<h4 id="DistKnow">2.2.2 Distributed knowledge</h4>

<p>
Another notion of group knowledge is <em>distributed knowledge</em>
(Fagin et al. 1995). Intuitively, a group <i>B</i> of agents has
distributed knowledge that <i>F</i> is true if and only if, were they
to pool together all that they know, they would then know <i>F</i>. As
an example, if agents <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are going to visit a
mutual friend, <i>a</i> knows that the friend is at home or at work,
and <i>b</i> knows that the friend is at work or at the cafe, then
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> have distributed knowledge that the friend is at
work: after they pool together what they know, they will each know the
location of the friend. Distributed knowledge and public announcements
have been studied by W&aacute;ng and &Aring;gotnes (2011). Related to
this is the study of whether a notion of group knowledge (such as
distributed knowledge) satisfies the property that something known by
the group can be established via communication; see Roelofsen (2007)
for details. </p>

<h3 id="MoorSent">2.3 Moore sentences</h3>

<p>
It may seem as though public announcements always
&ldquo;succeed&rdquo;, by which we mean that after something is
announced, we are guaranteed that that it is true. After all, this is
often the purpose of an announcement: by making the announcement, we
wish to inform everyone of its truth. However, it is not hard to come
up with announcements that are true when announced but false
afterward; that is, not all announcements are successful. Here are a
few everyday examples in plain English. </p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li> Agent <i>a</i>, who is visiting Amsterdam for the first time,
steps off the plane in the Amsterdam Airport Schiphol and
truthfully says, &ldquo;<i>a</i> has never made a statement in
Amsterdam&rdquo;.
<br />
This is unsuccessful because it is &ldquo;self-defeating&rdquo;: it
rules out various past statements, but it itself is one of those ruled
out, so the announcement violates what it says. </li>

<li>Agent <i>a</i> who does not know it is raining, is told, &ldquo;It
is raining but <i>a</i> does not know it&rdquo;.
<br />
This is an example of a <em>Moore formula</em>, which are sentences of
the form &ldquo;<i>p</i> is true but agent <i>a</i> does not know
<i>p</i>.&ldquo; In the language \eqref{ML}, Moore formulas have the
form \(p\land\lnot[a]p\). An announcement of a Moore formula is
unsuccessful because, after the announcement the agent comes to know
the first conjunct <i>p</i> (the statement &ldquo;it is raining&rdquo;
in the example), which therefore falsifies the second conjunct
\(\lnot[a]p\) (the statement &ldquo;<i>a</i> does not know it is
raining&rdquo; in the example). </li>
</ul>

<p>
The opposite of unsuccessful formulas are the &ldquo;successful&rdquo;
ones: these are the formulas that are true after they are announced.
Here one should distinguish between &ldquo;performative
announcements&rdquo; that bring about truth by their very occurrence
(e.g., a judge says, &ldquo;The objection is overruled&rdquo;, which
has the effect of making the objection overruled) and
&ldquo;informative announcements&rdquo; that simply inform their
listeners of truth (e.g., our mutual friend says, &ldquo;I live on
207th Street&rdquo;, which has the effect of informing us of something
that is already true). Performative announcements are best addressed
in a Dynamic Epistemic Logic setting using <em>factual changes</em>, a
topic discussed in
 <a href="appendix-G-EAL.html">Appendix G</a>.
 For now our concern will be with informative announcements. </p>

<p>
The phenomena of (un)successfulness of announcements was noted early
on by Hintikka (1962) but was not studied in detail until the advent
of Dynamic Epistemic Logic. In DEL, the explicit language for public
announcements provides for an explicit syntactic definition of
(un)successfulness. </p>

<strong>(Un)successful formula (van Ditmarsch and Kooi 2006; see also
Gerbrandy 1999).</strong> Let <i>F</i> be a formula in a language with
public announcements.</p>

<ul>

<li> To say that <i>F</i> is <em>successful</em> means that
\(\models[F!]F\).
<br />
&ldquo;A successful formula is one that is always true after it is

<li>To say that <i>F</i> is <em>unsuccessful</em> means that

&ldquo;An unsuccessful formula is one that may be false after it is

<p>
As we have seen, the Moore formula </p> 

\[\begin{equation*}\tag{MF} p\land\lnot[a]p \end{equation*}\]

<p>
is unsuccessful: if (MF) is true, then its announcement eliminates all
\(\lnot p\)-worlds, thereby falsifying \(\lnot[a]p\) (since the truth
of \(\lnot[a]p\) requires the existence of an <i>a</i>-arrow leading
to a \(\lnot p\)-world). </p>

<p>
An example of a successful formula is a propositional letter <i>p</i>.
In particular, after an announcement of <i>p</i>, it is clear that
<i>p</i> still holds (since the propositional valuation does not
change); that is, \([p!]p\). Moreover, as the reader can easily
verify, the formula \([a]p\) is also successful. </p>

<p>
In considering (un)successful formulas, a natural question arises: can
we provide an syntactic characterization of the formulas that are
(un)successful? That is, is there a way for us know whether a formula
is (un)successful simply by looking at its form? Building off of the
work of Visser et al. (1994) and Andr&eacute;ka, Ne&#769;meti, and van
Benthem (1998), van Ditmarsch and Kooi (2006) provide one
characterization of some of the successful \eqref{PAL+C}-formulas.

<h2 id="CompEpisInte">3. Complex epistemic interactions</h2>

<p>
In the previous section, we focused on one kind of model-transforming
action: the public announcement. In this section, we look at the
popular &ldquo;action model&rdquo; generalization of public
announcements due to Baltag, Moss, and Solecki (Baltag, Moss, and
Solecki 1998), together referred to as &ldquo;BMS&rdquo;. Action
models are simple relational structures that can be used to describe a
variety of informational actions, from public announcements to more
subtle communications that may contain degrees of privacy,
misdirection, deception, and suspicion, to name just a few
possibilities. </p>

<h3 id="ActiModeDescCompInfoScen">3.1 Action models describe complex informational scenarios</h3>

<p>
To begin, let us consider a specific example of a more complex
communicative action: a completely private announcement. The idea of
this action is that one agent, let us call her <i>a</i>, is to receive
a message in complete privacy. Accordingly, no other agent should
learn the contents of this message, and, furthermore, no other agent
should even consider the possibility that agent <i>a</i> received the
message in the first place. (Think of agent <i>a</i> traveling
unnoticed to a secret and secure location, finding and reading a coded
message only she can decode, and then destroying the message then and
there.) One way to think about this action is as follows: there are
two possible events that might occur. One of these, let us call it
event <i>e</i>, is the announcement that <i>p</i> is true; this is the
secret message to <i>a</i>. The other event, let us call it <i>f</i>,
is the announcement that the propositional constant \(\top\) for truth
is true, an action that conveys no new propositional information
(since \(\top\) is a tautology). Agent <i>a</i> should know that the
message is <i>p</i> and hence that the event that is in fact occurring
is <i>e</i>. All other agents should mistakenly believe that it is
common knowledge that the message is \(\top\) and not even consider
the possibility that the message is <i>p</i>. Accordingly, other
agents should consider event <i>f</i> the one and only possibility and
mistakenly believe that this is common knowledge. We picture a
diagrammatic representation of this setup in Figure 3. </p>

<div class="figure" id="Fig3">

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 3:</span> The pointed action model
\((\Pri_a(p),e)\) for the completely private announcement of <i>p</i>
to agent <i>a</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>
In the figure, our two events <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> are pictured as
rectangles (to distinguish these from the circled worlds of a Kripke
model). The formula appearing inside an event&rsquo;s rectangle is
what is announced when the event occurs. So event <i>e</i> represents
the announcement of <i>p</i>, and event <i>f</i> represents the
announcement of \(\top\). The event that actually occurs, called the
&ldquo;point&rdquo;, is indicated using a double rectangle; in this
case, the point is <i>e</i>. The only event that <i>a</i> considers
possible is <i>e</i> because the only <i>a</i>-arrow leaving <i>e</i>
loops right back to <i>e</i>. But all of the agents in our agent set
\(\sA\) other than <i>a</i> mistakenly consider the alternative event
<i>f</i> as the only possibility: all non&ndash;<i>a</i>-arrows
leaving <i>e</i> point to <i>f</i>. Furthermore, from the perspective
of event <i>f</i>, it is common knowledge that event <i>f</i> (and its
announcement of \(\top\)) is the only event that occurs: every agent
has exactly one arrow leaving <i>f</i> and this arrow loops right back
to <i>f</i>. Accordingly, the structure pictured above describes the
following action: <i>p</i> is to be announced, agent <i>a</i> is to
know this, and all other agents are to mistakenly believe it is common
knowledge that \(\top\) is announced. Structures like those pictured
in Figure 3 are called <em>action models</em>. </p>

<p>
<strong>Action model (Baltag, Moss, and Solecki 1998, 1999; see also
Baltag and Moss 2004).</strong> Other names in the literature:
&ldquo;event model&rdquo; or &ldquo;update model&rdquo;. Given a set
of formulas \(\Lang\) and a finite nonempty set \(\sA\) of agents, an
<em>action model</em> is a structure 

\[ A=(E,R,\pre) \]

 consisting of</p>

<ul>

<li> a nonempty finite set <i>E</i> of the possible communicative
<em>events</em> that might occur, </li>

<li> a function \(R:\sA\to P(W\times W)\) that assigns to each agent
\(a\in\sA\) a binary possibility relation \(R_a\subseteq E\times E\),
and </li>

<li> a function \(\pre:E\to\Lang\) that assigns to each event \(e\in
E\) a <em>precondition</em> formula \(\pre(e)\in\Lang\). Intuitively,
the precondition \(\pre(e)\) is announced when event <i>e</i> occurs.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Notation: if <i>A</i> is an action model, then adding a superscript
<i>A</i> to a symbol in \(\{E,R,\pre\}\) is used to denote a component
of the triple that makes up <i>A</i> in such a way that
\((E^A,R^A,\pre^A)=A\). We define a <em>pointed action model</em>,
sometimes also called an <em>action</em>, to be a pair \((A,e)\)
consisting of an action model <i>A</i> and an event \(e\in E^A\) that
is called the \(point\). In drawing action models, events are drawn as
rectangles, and a point (if any) is indicated with a double rectangle.
We use many of the same drawing and terminological conventions for
action models that we use for (pointed) Kripke models (see
 <a href="appendix-A-kripke.html">Appendix A</a>).</p>
 </div>

<p>
\((\Pri_a(p),e)\) is the action pictured in
 <a href="#Fig3">Figure 3</a>.
 Given an initial pointed Kripke model \((M,w)\) at which <i>p</i> is
true, we determine the model-transforming effect of the action
\((\Pri_a(p),e)\) by constructing a new pointed Kripke model

\[ (M[\Pri_a(p)],(w,e)). \]

 The construction of the Kripke model \(M[\Pri_a(p)]\) is
given by the BMS &ldquo;product update&rdquo;. </p>

<div class="indent">

<div id="AM-cons">
</div>

<p>
<strong>Product update (Baltag, Moss, and Solecki 1998, 1999; see also
Baltag and Moss 2004).</strong> Let \((M,w)\) be a pointed Kripke
model and \((A,e)\) be a pointed action model. Let \(\models\) be a
binary satisfaction relation defined between \((M,w)\) and formulas in
the language \(\Lang\) of the precondition function
\(\pre^A:E^A\to\Lang\) of the action model <i>A</i>. If
\(M,w\models\pre^A(e)\), then the Kripke model 

\[
M[A]=(W[A],R[A],V[A])
\]

 is defined
via the <em>product update</em> operation \(M\mapsto M[A]\) given as
follows:</p>

<ul>

<li> \(W[A] \coloneqq \{ (v,f)\in W\times E \mid M,v\models\pre^A(f)
\}\) &mdash; pair worlds with events whose preconditions they satisfy,
</li>

<li>\((v_1,f_1)R[A]_a(v_2,f_2)\) if and only if \(v_1 R^M_a v_2\) and
\(f_1 R^A_a f_2\) &mdash; insert an <i>a</i>-arrow in \(M[A]\) between
a pair just in case there is an <i>a</i>-arrow in <i>M</i> between the
worlds and an <i>a</i>-arrow in <i>A</i> between the events, and </li>

<li>\(V[A]((v,f))\coloneqq V^M(p)\) &mdash; make the valuation of
<i>p</i> at the pair \((v,f)\) just as it was at <i>v</i>. </li>
</ul>

<p>
An action \((A,e)\) operates on an initial situation \((M,w)\)
satisfying \(M,w\models\pre^A(e)\) via the product update to produce
the resultant situation \((M[A],(w,e))\). </p>
</div>

<p>
In this definition, the worlds of \(M[A]\) are obtained by making
multiple copies of the worlds of <i>M</i>, one copy per event \(f\in
E^A\). The event-<i>f</i> copy of a world <i>v</i> in <i>M</i> is
represented by the pair \((v,f)\). Such a pair is to be included in
the worlds of \(M[A]\) if and only if \((M,v)\) satisfies the
precondition \(\pre^A(f)\) of event <i>f</i>. The term &ldquo;product
update&rdquo; comes from the fact that the set \(W[A]\) of worlds of
\(M[A]\) is specified by restricting the full Cartesian product
\(W^M\times E^A\) to those pairs \((v,f)\) whose indicated world
<i>v</i> satisfies the precondition \(\pre^A(f)\) of the indicated
event <i>f</i>; that is, the &ldquo;product update&rdquo; is based on
a restricted Cartesian product, hence the name. </p>

<p>
According to the product update, we insert an <i>a</i>-arrow
\((v_1,f_1)\to_a (v_2,f_2)\) in \(M[A]\) if and only if there is an
<i>a</i>-arrow \(v_1\to_a v_2\) in <i>M</i> and an <i>a</i>-arrow
\(f_1\to_a f_2\) in <i>A</i>. In this way, agent <i>a</i>&rsquo;s
uncertainty in the resultant model \(M[A]\) comes from two sources:
her initial uncertainty in <i>M</i> (represented by \(R^M_a\)) as to
which is the actual world and her uncertainty in <i>A</i> (represented
by \(R^A_a\)) as to which is the actual event. Finally, the valuation
at the copy \((v,f)\) in \(M[A]\) is just the same as it was at the
original world <i>v</i> in <i>M</i>. </p>

<p>
For an example of the product update in action, consider the following
pointed Kripke model \((M,w)\): </p>

<div class="figure">
<img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-kripke.jpg" alt="" />

<div class="center">
<i>M</i>
</div>
</div>

<p>
The action model \(\Pri_a(p)\) from
 <a href="#Fig3">Figure 3</a>
 operates on \((M,w)\) via the product update to produce the resultant
situation \((M[\Pri_a(p)],(w,e))\) pictured as follows: </p>

<div class="figure">
<img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-kripke-pri.jpg" alt="" />

<div class="center">
\(M[\Pri_a(p)]\)
</div>
</div>

<p>
Indeed, to produce \(M[\Pri_a(p)]\) from <i>M</i> via the product
update with the action model \(\Pri_a(p)\): </p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li> Event <i>e</i> has us copy worlds at which
\(\pre^{\Pri_a(p)}(e)=p\) is true; this is just the world <i>w</i>,
which we retain in the form \((w,e)\) with the same valuation. </li>

<li>Event <i>f</i> has us copy worlds at which
\(\pre^{\Pri_a(p)}(f)=\top\) is true; this is both <i>w</i> and
<i>v</i>, which we retain in the forms \((w,f)\) and \((v,f)\),
respectively, with their same respective valuations. </li>

<li>We interconnect the worlds in \(M[\Pri_a(p)]\) with agent arrows
according to the recipe of the product update: place an arrow between
pairs just in case we have arrows componentwise in <i>M</i> and in
\(\Pri_a(p)\), respectively. For example, we have a <i>b</i>-arrow
\((w,e)\to_b(v,f)\) in \(M[\Pri_a(p)]\) because we have the
<i>b</i>-arrow \(w\to_b v\) in <i>M</i> and the <i>b</i>-arrow
\(e\to_b f\) in \(\Pri_a(p)\). </li>

<li>The point (i.e., actual world) \((w,e)\) of the resultant
situation is obtained by paring together the point <i>w</i> from the
initial situation \((M,w)\) and the point <i>e</i> from the applied
action \((\Pri_a(p),e)\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
We therefore obtain the model \(M[\Pri_a(p)]\) as pictured above. We
note that the product update-induced mapping 

\[
(M,w) \mapsto
(M[A],(w,e))
\]

 from the
initial situation \((M,w)\) to the resultant situation
\((M[A],(w,e))\) has the following effect: we go from an initial
situation \((M,w)\) in which neither agent knows whether <i>p</i> is
true to a resultant situation \((M[A],(w,e))\) in which <i>a</i> knows
<i>p</i> is true but <i>b</i> mistakenly believes everyone&rsquo;s
knowledge is unchanged. This is of course just what we want of the
private announcement of <i>p</i> to agent <i>a</i>. </p>

<p>
We now take a moment to comment on the similarities and differences
between action models and Kripke models. To begin, both are labeled
directed graphs (consisting of labeled nodes and labeled edges
pointing between the nodes). A node of a Kripke model (a
&ldquo;world&rdquo;) is labeled by the propositional letters that are
true at the world; in contrast, a node of an action model (an
&ldquo;event&rdquo;) is labeled by a single formula that is to be
announced if the event occurs. However, in both cases, agent
uncertainty is represented using the same &ldquo;considered
possibilities&rdquo; approach. In the case of Kripke models, an agent
considers various possibilities for the world that might be actual; in
the case of action models, an agent considers various possibilities
for the event that might actually occur. The key insight behind action
models, as put forward by Baltag, Moss, and Solecki (1998), is that
these two uncertainties can be represented using similar
graph-theoretic structures. We can therefore leverage our experience
working with Kripke models when we need to devise new action models
that describe complex communicative actions. In particular, to
construct an action model for a given action, all we must do is break
up the action into a number of simple announcement events and then
describe the agents&rsquo; respective uncertainties among these events
in the appropriate way so as to obtain the desired action. The
difficulty, of course, is in determining the exact uncertainty
relationships. However, this determination amounts to inserting the
appropriate agent arrows between possible events, and doing this
requires the same kind of reasoning as that which we used in the
construction of Kripke models meeting certain basic or higher-order
knowledge constraints. We demonstrate this now by way of example,
constructing a few important action models along the way. </p>

<h3 id="ExamActiMode">3.2 Examples of action models</h3>

<p>
We saw the example of a completely private announcement in
 <a href="#Fig3">Figure 3</a>,
 a complex action in which one agent learns something without the
other agents even suspecting that this is so. Before devising an
action model for another similarly complicated action, let us return
to our most basic action: the public announcement of <i>p</i>. The
idea of this action is that all agents receive the information that
<i>p</i> is true, and this is common knowledge. So to construct an
action model for this action, we need only one event <i>e</i> that
conveys the announcement that <i>p</i> is true, and the occurrence of
this event should be common knowledge. This leads us immediately to
the action model \(\Pub(p)\) pictured in Figure 4. </p>

<div class="figure" id="Fig4">
<img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-pub-actm.jpg" alt="" />

<div class="center">
\(\Pub(p)\)
</div>

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 4:</span> The pointed action model
\((\Pub(p),e)\) for the public announcement of <i>p</i>. </p>
</div>

<p>
It is not difficult to see that \(\Pub(p)\) is just what we want:
event <i>e</i> conveys the desired announcement and the reflexive
arrows for each agent make it so that this event is common knowledge.
It is important to note that in virtue of the fact that we can
construct an action model for public announcements, it follows that
action models are a generalization of public announcements. </p>

<p>
We now turn to a more complicated action: the semi-private
announcement of <i>p</i> to agent <i>a</i> (sometimes called the
&ldquo;semi-public announcement&rdquo; of <i>p</i> to agent <i>a</i>).
The idea of this action is that agent <i>a</i> is told that <i>p</i>
is true, the other agents know that <i>a</i> is told the truth value
of <i>p</i>, but these other agents do not know what it is exactly
that <i>a</i> is told. This suggests an action model with two events,
one for each thing that <i>a</i> might be told: an event <i>e</i> that
announces <i>p</i> and event <i>f</i> that announces \(\lnot p\).
Agent <i>a</i> is to know which event occurs, whereas all other agents
are to be uncertain as to which event occurs. This leads us to the
action model \(\frac12\Pri_a(p)\) pictured in Figure 5. </p>

<div class="figure" id="Fig5">
<img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-semipri-actm.jpg" alt="" />

<div class="center">
\(\frac12\Pri_a(p)\)
</div>

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 5:</span> The pointed action model
\((\frac12\Pri_a(p),e)\) for the semi-private announcement of <i>p</i>
to agent <i>a</i>. </p>
</div>

<p>
We see that \(\frac12\Pri_a(p)\) satisfies just what we want: the
actual event that occurs is the point <i>e</i> (the announcement of
the precondition <i>p</i>), agent <i>a</i> knows this, but all other
agents consider it possible that either <i>e</i> (the announcement of
<i>p</i>) or <i>f</i> (the announcement of \(\lnot p\)) occurred.
Furthermore, the other agents know that <i>a</i> knows which event was
the case (since at each of the events <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> that they
consider possible, agent <i>a</i> knows the event that occurs). This
is just what we want of a semi-private announcement. </p>

<p>
Finally, let us consider a much more challenging action: the
misleading private announcement of <i>p</i> to agent <i>a</i>. The
idea of this action is that agent <i>a</i> is told <i>p</i> in a
completely private manner but all other agents are misled into
believing that <i>a</i> received the private announcement of \(\lnot
p\) instead. So to construct an action model for this, we need a few
elements: events for the private announcement of \(\lnot p\) to
<i>a</i> that the non-<i>a</i> agents mistakenly believe occurs and an
event for the actual announcement of <i>p</i> that only <i>a</i> knows
occurs. As for the events for the private announcement of \(\lnot p\),
it follows by a simple modification of
 <a href="#Fig3">Figure 3</a>
 that the private announcement of \(\lnot p\) to agent <i>a</i> is the
action \((\Pri_a(\lnot p),e)\) pictured as follows: </p>

<div class="figure">
<img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-priN-actm.jpg" alt="" />

<div class="center">
\(\Pri_a(\lnot p)\)
</div>
</div>

<p>
Since the other agents are to believe that the above action occurs,
they should believe it is event <i>e</i> that occurs. However, they
are mistaken: what actually does occur is a new event <i>g</i> that
conveys to <i>a</i> the private information that <i>p</i> is true.
Taken together, we obtain the action \((\MPri_a(p),g)\) pictured in
Figure 6. </p>

<div class="figure" id="Fig6">
<img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-misleading-pri-actm.jpg" alt="" />

<div class="center">
\(\MPri_a(p)\)

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 6:</span> The pointed action model
\((\MPri_a(p),g)\) for the misleading private announcement of <i>p</i>
to agent <i>a</i>. </p>
</div>

<p>
Looking at \(\MPri_a(p)\), we see that if we were to to delete event
<i>g</i> (and all arrows to and from <i>g</i>), then we would obtain
\(\Pri_a(\lnot p)\). So events <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> in \(\MPri_a(p)\)
play the role of representing the &ldquo;misdirection&rdquo; the
non-<i>a</i> agents experience: the private announcement of \(\lnot
p\) to agent <i>a</i>. However, it is event <i>g</i> that actually
occurs: this event conveys to <i>a</i> that <i>p</i> is true while
misleading the other agents into believing that it is event <i>e</i>,
the event corresponding to the private announcement of \(\lnot p\) to
<i>a</i>, that occurs. In sum, <i>a</i> receives the information that
<i>p</i> is true while the other agents are mislead into believing
that <i>a</i> received the private announcement of \(\lnot p\). One
consequence of this is that non-<i>a</i> agents come to hold the
following beliefs: \(\lnot p\) is true, agent <i>a</i> knows this, and
agent <i>a</i> believes the others believe that no new propositional
information was provided. These beliefs are all incorrect. The
non-<i>a</i> agents are therefore highly mislead. </p>

<h3 id="LogiEpisActi">3.3 The Logic of Epistemic Actions</h3>

<p>
Now that we have seen a number of action models, we turn to the formal
syntax and semantics of the language \eqref{EAL} of <em>Epistemic
Action Logic</em> (a.k.a., <em>the Logic of Epistemic Actions</em>).
We define the language \eqref{EAL} along with the set \(\AM_*\) of
pointed action models with preconditions in the language \eqref{EAL}
according to the following recursive grammar: </p> 

\[\begin{gather*}
F  \ccoloneqq p \mid F \wedge F \mid \neg F \mid [a]F \mid [A,e]F \\
 \small p \in \sP,\; a \in \sA,\; (A,e)\in\AM_*
\taglabel{EAL}
\end{gather*}\]

<p>
To be clear: in the language \eqref{EAL}, the precondition
\(\pre^A(e)\) of an action model <i>A</i> may be a formula that
includes an action model modality \([A',e']\) for some other action
\((A',e')\in\AM_*\). For full technical details on how this works,
please see
 <a href="appendix-H-recursion.html">Appendix H</a>.
 </p>

<p>
For convenience, we let \(\AM\) denote the set of all action models
whose preconditions are all in the language \eqref{EAL}. As we saw in
the previous two subsections, the set \(\AM_*\) contains pointed
action models for public announcements
 (<a href="#Fig4">Figure 4</a>),
 private announcements
 (<a href="#Fig3">Figure 3</a>),
 semi-private announcements
 (<a href="#Fig5">Figure 5</a>),
 and misleading private announcements

 along with many others. The satisfaction relation \(\models\) between
pointed Kripke models and formulas of \eqref{EAL} is the smallest
extension of the relation \(\models\) for \eqref{ML} (see
 <a href="appendix-A-kripke.html">Appendix A</a>)
 satisfying the following: </p>

<ul>

<li> \(M,w\models[A,e]G\) holds if and only if
\(M,w\not\models\pre^A(e)\) or \(M[A],(w,e)\models G\), where the
Kripke model \(M[A]\) is defined via the
 <a href="#AM-cons">BMS product update</a>
 (Baltag, Moss, and Solecki 1999). </li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that the formula \([A,e]G\) is vacuously true if the precondition
\(\pre(e)\) of event <i>e</i> is false. Accordingly, the action model
semantics retains the assumption of truthfulness that we had for
public announcements. That is, for an event to actually occur, its
precondition must be true. As a consequence, the occurrence of an
event <i>e</i> implies that its precondition \(\pre(e)\) was true, and
hence the occurrence of an event conveys its precondition formula as a
message. If an event can occur at a given world, then we say that the
event is <em>executable</em> at that world. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Executable events and action models.</strong> To say that a
pointed action model \((A,e)\) is <em>executable</em> at a pointed
Kripke model \((M,w)\) means that \(M,w\models\pre(e)\). To say that
an event <i>f</i> in an action model <i>A</i> is <em>executable</em>
means that \((A,f)\) is executable. To say that an action model
<i>A</i> is <em>executable</em> in a Kripke model <i>M</i> means there
is an event <i>f</i> in <i>A</i> and a world <i>v</i> in <i>M</i> such
that <i>f</i> is executable at \((M,v)\).</p>

<p>
As was the case for PAL, one often wishes to restrict attention to
Kripke models whose relations \(R_a\) satisfy certain desirable
properties such as reflexivity, transitivity, Euclideanness, and
seriality. In order to study actions over such classes, we must be
certain that the actions do not transform a Kripke model in the class
into a new Kripke model not in the class; that is, we must ensure that
the class of Kripke models is &ldquo;closed&rdquo; under actions. The
following theorem provides some sufficient conditions that guarantee
closure. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Action Model Closure Theorem.</strong> Let \(M=(W^M,R^M,V)\)

<ul>

<li> If \(R^M_a\) and \(R^A_a\) are reflexive, then so is
\(R^M[A]_a\). </li>

<li>If \(R^M_a\) and \(R^A_a\) are transitive, then so is
\(R^M[A]_a\). </li>

<li>If \(R^M_a\) and \(R^A_a\) are Euclidean, then so is \(R^M[A]_a\).
</li>

<li>If <i>A</i> satisfies the condition that every event \(e\in W^A\)
gives rise to a nonempty set 

\[ S(e)\subseteq \{f\in W^A\mid eR^A_af\} \]

 of events such that

\[
\textstyle

\may{a}\left(\bigvee_{f\in S(e)}\pre^A(f)\right)

 then \(R^M[A]_a\) is serial. (Note: the condition on

that \(R^M_a\) is serial.) </li>

This theorem, like the analogous theorem for Public Announcement
Logic, is used in providing simple sound and complete theories for the
Logic of Epistemic Actions based on appropriate
&ldquo;action-friendly&rdquo; logics. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Action-friendly logic.</strong> To say that a logic \(\L\) is
<em>action-friendly</em> means we have the following:</p>

<ul>

<li> \(\L\) is a normal multi-modal logic in the language \eqref{ML}
(i.e., with modals \([a]\) for each agent \(a\in\sA\)), </li>

<li>there is a class of Kripke models \(\sC\) such that \(\L\) is

<p>
The first three reduction axioms are nearly identical to the
corresponding reduction axioms for \(\PAL\), except that the first and
third \(\EAL\) reduction axioms check the truth of a precondition in
the place where the \(\PAL\) reduction axioms would check the truth of
the formula to be announced. This is actually the same kind of check:
for an event, the precondition must hold in order for the event to be
executable; for a public announcement, the formula must be true in
order for the public announcement to occur (and hence for the public
announcement event in question to be &ldquo;executable&rdquo;). The
major difference between the \(\PAL\) and \(\EAL\) reduction axioms is
in the fourth \(\EAL\) reduction axiom. This axiom specifies the
conditions under which an agent has belief (or knowledge) of something
after the occurrence of an action. In particular, adopting a doxastic
reading for this discussion, the axiom says that agent <i>a</i>
believes <i>G</i> after the occurrence of action \((A,e)\) if and only
if the formula 

\[
\textstyle
\pre(e)\to\bigwedge_{e R_af}[a][A,f]G
\]

 is true. This formula, in turn, says that
if the precondition is true&mdash;and therefore the action is
executable&mdash;then, for each of the possible events the agent
entertains, she believes that <i>G</i> is true if the event in
question occurs. This makes sense: <i>a</i> cannot be sure which of
the events has occurred, and so for her to believe something after the
action has occurred, she must be sure that this something is true no
matter which of her entertained events might have been the actual one.
For example, if <i>a</i> sees her friend <i>b</i> become elated as he
listens to something he hears on the other side of a private phone
call, then the <i>a</i> may not know exactly what it is that <i>b</i>
is being told; nevertheless, <i>a</i> has reason to believe that
<i>b</i> is receiving good news because, no matter what it is exactly
that he is being told (i.e., no matter which of the events she thinks
that he may be hearing), she knows from his reaction that he must be
receiving good news. </p>

<p>
As was the case for \(\PAL\), the \(\EAL\) reduction axioms allow us
to &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; each formula containing action models to a
provably equivalent formula whose action model modalities appear
before formulas of lesser complexity, allowing us to eliminate action
model modalities completely via a sequence of provable equivalences.
As a consequence, we have the following. </p>

<div class="indent">

 </p>

<h2 id="BeliChanDynaEpisLogi">4. Belief change and Dynamic Epistemic Logic</h2>

<p>
Up to this point, the logics we have developed all have one key
limitation: an agent cannot meaningfully assimilate information that
contradicts her knowledge or beliefs; that is, incoming information
that is <em>inconsistent</em> with an agent&rsquo;s knowledge or
belief leads to difficulties. For example, if agent <i>a</i> believes
<i>p</i>, then announcing that <i>p</i> is false brings about a state
in which the agent&rsquo;s beliefs are trivialized (in the sense that
she comes to believe <em>every</em> sentence): </p> 

\[\models [a]p\to[\lnot p!][a]F\quad \text{for all formulas } F.\]

<p>
Note that in the above, we may replace <i>F</i> by a contradiction
such as the propositional constant \(\bot\) for falsehood.
Accordingly, an agent who initially believes <i>p</i> is lead by an
announcement that <i>p</i> is false to an inconsistent state in which
she believes <em>everything</em>, including falsehoods. This
trivialization occurs whenever something is announced that contradicts
the agent&rsquo;s beliefs; in particular, it occurs if a contradiction
such as \(\bot\) is itself announced: </p> 

\[\models[\bot!][a]F\quad \text{ for all formulas } F.\]

<p>
In everyday life, the announcement of a contradiction, when recognized
as such, is generally not informative; at best, a listener who
realizes she is hearing a contradiction learns that there is some
problem with the announcer or the announced information itself.
However, the announcement of something that is not intrinsically
contradictory but merely contradicts existing beliefs is an everyday
occurrence of great importance: upon receipt of trustworthy
information that our belief about something is wrong, a rational
response is to adjust our beliefs in an appropriate way. Part of this
adjustment requires a determination of our attitude toward the general
reliability or trustworthiness of the incoming information: perhaps we
trust it completely, like a young child trusts her parents. Or maybe
our attitude is more nuanced: we are willing to trust the information
for now, but we still allow for the possibility that it might be
wrong, perhaps leading us to later revise our beliefs if and when we
learn that it is incorrect. Or maybe we are much more skeptical: we
distrust the information for now, but we do not completely disregard
the possibility, however seemingly remote, that it might turn out to
be true. </p>

<p>
What is needed is an adaptation of the above-developed frameworks that
can handle incoming information that may contradict existing beliefs
and that does so in a way that accounts for the many nuanced attitudes
an agent may have with respect to the general reliability or
trustworthiness of the information. This has been a focus of much
recent activity in the DEL literature. </p>

<h3 id="BeliReviErroAwarBeliChan">4.1 Belief Revision: error-aware belief change</h3>

<p>
Belief Revision is the study of belief change brought about by the
acceptance of incoming information that may contradict initial beliefs
(G&auml;rdenfors 2003; Ove Hansson 2012; Peppas 2008). The seminal
work in this area is due to Alchourr&oacute;n, G&auml;rdenfors, and
Mackinson, or &ldquo;AGM&rdquo; (1985). The AGM approach to belief
revision characterizes belief change using a number of postulates.
Each postulate provides a qualitative account of the belief revision
process by saying what must obtain with respect to the agent&rsquo;s
beliefs after revision by an incoming formula <i>F</i>. For example,
the AGM <em>Success</em> postulate says that the formulas the agent
believes after revision by <i>F</i> must include <i>F</i> itself; that
is, the revision always &ldquo;succeeds&rdquo; in causing the agent to
come to believe the incoming information <i>F</i>. </p>

<p>
Belief Revision has traditionally restricted attention to
single-agent, &ldquo;ontic&rdquo; belief change: the beliefs in
question all belong to a single agent, and the beliefs themselves
concern only the &ldquo;facts&rdquo; of the world and not, in
particular, higher-order beliefs (i.e., beliefs about beliefs).
Further, as a result of the Success postulate, the incoming formula
<i>F</i> that brings about the belief change is assumed to be
<em>completely trustworthy</em>: the agent accepts without question
the incoming information <i>F</i> and incorporates it into her set of
beliefs as per the belief change process. </p>

<p>
Work on belief change in Dynamic Epistemic Logic incorporates key
ideas from Belief Revision Theory but removes three key restrictions.
First, belief change in DEL can can involve higher-order beliefs (and
not just &ldquo;ontic&rdquo; information). Second, DEL can be used in
multi-agent scenarios. Third, the DEL approach permits agents to have
more nuanced attitudes with respect to the incoming information. </p>

<h3 id="StatDynaBeliChan">4.2 Static and dynamic belief change</h3>

<p>
The literature on belief change in Dynamic Epistemic Logic makes an
important distinction between &ldquo;static&rdquo; and
&ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; belief change (van Ditmarsch 2005; Baltag and
Smets 2008b; van Benthem 2007). </p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li> <strong>Static belief change:</strong> the objects of agent
belief are fixed external truths that do not change, though the
agent&rsquo;s beliefs about these truths may change. In a motto,
static belief change involves &ldquo;changing beliefs about an
<em>unchanging</em> situation&rdquo;. </li>

<li><strong>Dynamic belief change:</strong> the objects of agent
belief include not only external truths but also the beliefs
themselves, and part or all of these can change. In a motto, dynamic
belief change involves &ldquo;changing beliefs about a
<em>changing</em> situation that itself includes these very
beliefs&rdquo;. </li>
</ul>

<p>
To better explain and illustrate the difference, let us consider the
result of a belief change brought about by the Moore formula </p>

\[\begin{equation*}\taglabel{MF}
p\land\lnot[a]p,
\end{equation*}\]

<p>
informally read, &ldquo;<i>p</i> is true but agent <i>a</i> does not
believe it&rdquo;. Let us suppose that this formula is true; that is,
<i>p</i> is true and, indeed, agent <i>a</i> does not believe that
<i>p</i> is true. Now suppose that agent <i>a</i> receives the formula
\eqref{MF} from a completely trustworthy source and is supposed to
change her beliefs to take into account the information this formula
provides. In a dynamic belief change, she will accept the formula
\eqref{MF} and hence, in particular, she will come to believe that
<i>p</i> is true. But then the formula \eqref{MF} becomes false: she
now believes <i>p</i> and therefore the formula \(\lnot[a]p\)
(&ldquo;agent <i>a</i> does not believe <i>p</i>&rdquo;) is false. So
we see that this belief change is indeed dynamic: in revising her
beliefs based on the incoming true formula \eqref{MF}, the truth of
the formula \eqref{MF} was itself changed. That is, the
&ldquo;situation&rdquo;, which involves the truth of <i>p</i> and the
agent&rsquo;s beliefs about this truth, changed as per the belief
change brought about by the agent learning that \eqref{MF} is true.
(As an aside, this example shows that for <em>dynamic</em> belief
change, the AGM Success postulate is violated and so must be dropped.)
</p>

<p>
Perhaps surprisingly, it is also possible to undergo a <em>static</em>
belief change upon receipt of the true formula \eqref{MF} from a
completely trustworthy source. For this to happen, we must think of
the &ldquo;situation&rdquo; with regard to the truth of <i>p</i> and
the agent&rsquo;s beliefs about this truth as completely static, like
a &ldquo;snapshot in time&rdquo;. We then look at how the
agent&rsquo;s beliefs about that static snapshot might change upon
receipt of the completely trustworthy information that \eqref{MF} was
true in the moment of that snapshot. To make sense of this, it might
be helpful to think of it this way: the agent learns something <em>in
the present</em> about what was true of her situation <em>in the
past</em>. So her present views about her past beliefs change, but the
past beliefs remain fixed. It is as though the agent studies a
photograph of herself from the past: her &ldquo;present self&rdquo;
changes her beliefs about that &ldquo;past self&rdquo; pictured in the
photograph, fixed forever in time. In a certain respect, the
&ldquo;past self&rdquo; might as well be a different person: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Now that I have been told \eqref{MF} is true at the moment pictured in
the photograph, what can I say about the situation in the picture and
about the person in that situation? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So to perform a <em>static belief change</em> upon receipt of the
incoming formula <i>F</i>, the agent is to change her present belief
based on the information that <i>F</i> was true in the state of
affairs that existed <em>before</em> she was told about <i>F</i>.
Accordingly, in performing a static belief change upon receipt of
\eqref{MF}, the agent will come to accept that, just before she was
told \eqref{MF}, the letter <i>p</i> was true but she did not believe
that <i>p</i> was true. But most importantly, this will not cause her
to believe that \eqref{MF} is true <em>afterward</em>: she is only
changing her beliefs about what was true <em>in the past</em>; she has
not been provided with information that bears on the present. In
particular, while she will change her belief about the truth of
<i>p</i> in the moment that existed just before she was informed of
\eqref{MF}, she will leave her present belief about <i>p</i> as it is
(i.e., she still will not know that <i>p</i> is true). Therefore, upon
static belief revision by \eqref{MF}, it is still the case that
\eqref{MF} is true! (As an aside, this shows that for <em>static</em>
belief change, the AGM Success postulate is satisfied.) </p>

<p>
Static belief change occurs in everyday life when we receive
information about something that can quickly change, so that the
information can become &ldquo;stale&rdquo; (i.e., incorrect) just
after we receive it. This happens, for example, with our knowledge of
the price of a high-volume, high-volatility stock during trading
hours: if we check the price and then look away for the rest of the
day, we only know the price at the given moment in the past and cannot
guarantee that the price remains the same, even right after we checked
it. Therefore, we only know the price of the stock in the
past&mdash;not in the present&mdash;even though for practical reasons
we sometimes operate under the fiction that the price remains constant
after we checked it and therefore speak as though we know it (even
though we really do not). </p>

<p>
Dynamic belief change is more common in everyday life. It happens
whenever we receive information whose truth cannot rapidly become
&ldquo;stale&rdquo;: we are given the information and this information
bears directly on our present situation. </p>

<p>
We note that the distinction between static and dynamic belief change
may raise a dilemma that bears on the problem of skepticism in
Epistemology (see, e.g., entry on
 <a href="../epistemology/index.html">Epistemology</a>):
 our &ldquo;dynamic belief change skeptic&rdquo; might claim that
<em>all</em> belief changes must be static because we cannot really
know that then information we have received has not become stale. To
the authors&rsquo; knowledge, this topic has not yet been explored.
</p>

<h3 id="PlauModeBeliChan">4.3 Plausibility models and belief change</h3>

<p>
In the DEL study of belief change, situations involving the beliefs of
multiple agents are represented using a variation of basic Kripke
models called <em>plausibility models</em>. Static belief change is
interpreted as conditionalization in these models: without changing
the model (i.e., the situation), we see what the agent would believe
conditional on the incoming information. This will be explained in
detail in a moment. Dynamic belief change involves transforming
plausibility models: after introducing plausibility model-compatible
action models, we use model operators defined from these
&ldquo;plausibility action models&rdquo; to describe changes in the
plausibility model (i.e., the situation) itself. </p>

<p>
Our presentation of the DEL approach to belief change will follow
Baltag and Smets (2008b), so all theorems and definitions in the
remainder of Section 4 are due to them unless otherwise noted. Their
work is closely linked with the work of van Benthem (2007), Board
(2004), Grove (1988), and others. For an alternative approach based on
Propositional Dynamic Logic, we refer the reader to van Eijck and Wang
(2008). </p>

<p>
Plausibility models are used to represent more nuanced versions of
knowledge and belief. These models are also used to reason about
<em>static</em> belief changes. The idea behind plausibility models is
similar to that for our basic Kripke models: each agent considers
various worlds as possible candidates for the actual one. However,
there is a key difference: among any two worlds <i>w</i> and <i>v</i>
that an agent <i>a</i> considers possible, she imposes a relative
<em>plausibility order</em>. The plausibility order for agent <i>a</i>
is denoted by \(\geq_a\). We write </p>

<div class="indent">
\(w\geq_a v\) to mean that &ldquo;world <i>w</i> is no more plausible
than world <i>v</i> according to agent <i>a</i>&rdquo;.
</div>

<p>
Note that if we think of \(\geq_a\) as a &ldquo;greater than or equal
to&rdquo; sign, it is the &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; world that is either
<em>more</em> plausible or else of equal plausibility. The reason for
ordering things in this way comes from an idea due to Grove (1988): we
think of each world as positioned on the surface of exactly one of a
series of concentric spheres (of non-equal radii), with a more
plausible world located on a sphere of smaller radius and a less
plausible world located on a sphere of greater radius. Consider the
following illustration: </p>

<div class="figure">
<img style="vertical-align: middle; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-grove.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>
In this diagram, the black concentric circles indicate spheres, the
blue points on the smallest (i.e., innermost) sphere are the most
plausible worlds overall, the red points on the second-smallest (i.e.,
middle) sphere are the second-most plausible worlds, and the green
points on the largest sphere are the least plausible worlds overall.
</p>

<p id="BR-relations">
We write \(\leq_a\) (&ldquo;no less plausible than&rdquo;) for the
<em>converse plausibility relation</em>: \(w\leq_a v\) means that
\(v\geq_a w\). Also, we define the <em>strict plausibility
relation</em> \(\gt_a\) (&ldquo;strictly more plausible than&rdquo;)
in the usual way: \(w\gt_a v\) means that we have \(w\geq_a v\) and
\(v\ngeq_a w\). (A slash through the relation means the relation does
not hold.) The <em>strict converse plausibility relation</em>
\(\lt_a\) (&ldquo;strictly less plausible than&rdquo;) is defined as
expected: \(w\lt_a v\) means that \(v\gt_a w\). Finally, we define the
<em>equi-plausibility relation</em> \(\simeq_a\) (&ldquo;equally
plausible&rdquo;) as follows: \(w\simeq_a v\) means that we have
\(w\geq_a v\) and \(v\geq_a w\). </p>

<p id="Plaus-conventions">
We draw plausibility models much like our basic Kripke models from
before except that we use dashed arrows (instead of solid ones) in
order to indicate the plausibility relations and also to indicate that
the picture in question is one of a plausibility model. We adopt the
following conventions for drawing plausibility models. </p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li> One-way arrows indicate non-increasing plausibility:

<div class="figure">
<img style="vertical-align: middle; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-plaus-conf-1way.jpg" alt="" />
</div> indicates \(v\geq_aw\) for each \(a\in\{a_0,\dots,a_n\}\) </li>

<li> Two-way arrows are a shorthand for two one-way arrows, one in
each direction: letting \(\sigma\) denote a comma-separated list of
agents in \(\sA\),

<div class="figure center">

<div style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle">

</div>
</div> </li>

<li> Reflexive arrows are implied (so that \(\geq_a\) is reflexive for
each \(a\in\sA\)):

<div class="figure center">

<div style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle">
<img style="vertical-align: middle; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-plaus-conf-reflex1.jpg" alt="" />

</div>
</div> </li>

<li> Transitive arrows are implied (so that \(\geq_a\) is transitive
for each \(a\in\sA\)):

<div class="figure">
<img style="vertical-align: middle; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-plaus-conf-trans1.jpg" alt="" />
</div> indicates

<div class="figure">
<img style="vertical-align: middle; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-plaus-conf-trans2.jpg" alt="" />
</div> The transitive arrow rule and the two-way arrow rule may
interact: if one or both of the arrows \(u\dashrightarrow_a v\) or
\(v\dashrightarrow_a w\) were two-way, then we would still obtain the
implied transitive arrow \(u\dashrightarrow_a w\). </li>

<li>

<p>
An absence of a drawn or implied <i>a</i>-arrow from <i>v</i> to
<i>w</i> indicates \(v\not\geq_a w\): </p>

<div class="figure center">

<div style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle">
<img style="vertical-align: middle; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-plaus-conf-absence.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<div style="display:inline-block; vertical-align:middle;margin-left:1em">
indicates \(v\not\geq_a w\)
</div>
</div>

<p>
The picture above indicates there is no <i>a</i>-arrow from <i>v</i>
to <i>w</i> that is either drawn or implied. So we conclude that
\(v\not\geq_a w\) only after we have taken into account all drawn and
implied <i>a</i>-arrows and determined that no <i>a</i>-arrow from
<i>v</i> to <i>w</i> is indicated. </p> </li> 

<li> The picture must specify a relation \(\geq_a\) that is <em>locally connected</em>: defining for each world <i>w</i> the <em>connected component</em> \[ \cc_a(w) \coloneqq \{ v\in W \mid w({\geq_a}\cup{\leq_a})^*v\} \] of <i>w</i>, we have that \(v\in\cc_a(w)\) implies \(w\geq_a v\) or \(v\geq_a w\). <br />

 To explain
the meaning of this property, we first explain the definition of the
connected component \(\cc_a(w)\). This set is based on the union
relation \({\geq_a}\cup{\leq_a}\), which relates two worlds if and
only if they are related according to \(\geq_a\) or \(\leq_a\); that
is, we have \(w({\geq_a}\cup{\leq_a})v\) if and only if \(w\geq_a v\)
or \(w\leq_a v\). We then take the union relation and apply the
operator \((-)^*\), which forms the <em>reflexive-transitive
closure</em> \(R^*\) of a relation <i>R</i>: the relation \(R^*\)
relates two worlds if and only if they are the same or there exists a
sequence of intermediate worlds that are stepwise connected by the
underlying relation <i>R</i>. Therefore, we have
\(w({\geq_a}\cup{\leq_a})^*v\) if and only if \(w=v\) or there exists
a sequence \(u_1,\dots,u_n\) of worlds such that 

\[
w({\geq_a}\cup{\leq_a})u_1
({\geq_a}\cup{\leq_a})\cdots
({\geq_a}\cup{\leq_a})u_n({\geq_a}\cup{\leq_a})v.
\]

 So,
taken together, we have \(v\in\cc_a(w)\) if and only if \(v=w\) or
there is a sequence \(u_1,\dots,u_n\) of worlds connecting <i>v</i> to
<i>w</i> stepwise in terms of plausibility (without regard to whether
the relative plausibility is increasing, decreasing, or remaining the
same). In terms of our pictures of plausibility models, we have
\(v\in\cc_a(w)\) if and only if, after taking into account all drawn
and implied <i>a</i>-arrows and disregarding arrow directionality,
<i>v</i> and <i>w</i> are the same or are linked by a sequence of
<i>a</i>-arrows (in which each arrow can be followed both forward and
backward). The property of local connectedness then tells us that if
\(v\in\cc_a(w)\), then we must have \(w\geq_a v\) or \(v\geq_a w\).
That is, if there is an undirected <i>a</i>-arrow path from <i>w</i>
to <i>v</i>, then there is an <i>a</i>-arrow directly linking <i>w</i>
and <i>v</i> in one direction or the other. Therefore, if we think of
\(\cc_a(w)\) as the set of worlds that the agent <i>a</i> considers to
be possible whenever <i>w</i> is the actual world, local connectedness
tells us that agent <i>a</i> must always have an opinion as to the
relative plausibility between any two worlds that she considers to be
possible. It is in this sense that each agent must be
&ldquo;opinionated&ldquo; as to the relative plausibility of worlds
she considers possible. As an example, the property of local
connectivity disallows the following picture:

<div class="figure">
<img style="vertical-align: middle; max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-plaus-conf-lconnect.jpg" alt="" />
</div> This picture is disallowed because because it violates local
connectivity for \(\geq_a\): we have \(v\in\cc_a(w)\) and yet neither
\(v\geq_a w\) nor \(w\geq_a v\). In detail: we have \(v\in\cc_a(w)\)
because we have the undirected <i>a</i>-arrow path \(w\dashleftarrow_a
u\dashrightarrow_a v\) from <i>w</i> to <i>v</i>; and we have neither
\(y\geq_a z\) nor \(z\geq_a y\) because, after adding all implied
arrows (in this case only reflexive arrows must be added), we find
that we have neither \(v\dashrightarrow_a w\) nor \(v\dashleftarrow_a
w\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
Worlds in the same connected component are said to be
<em>informationally equivalent</em>. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Informational equivalence.</strong> Worlds <i>v</i> and
<i>w</i> are said to be <em>informationally equivalent (for agent
<i>a</i>)</em> if and only if \(\cc_a(w)=\cc_a(v)\). Notice that we
have \(\cc_a(w)=\cc_a(v)\) if and only if \(v\in\cc_a(w)\) if and only
if \(w\in\cc_a(v)\).</p>
</div>

<p>
The idea is that if <i>w</i> is the actual world, then agent <i>a</i>
has the information that the actual world must be one of those in her
connected component \(\cc_a(w)\). Thus the set \(\cc_a(w)\) makes up
the worlds agent <i>a</i> considers to be possible whenever <i>w</i>
is the actual world. And since \(w\in\cc_a(w)\), agent <i>a</i> will
always consider the actual world to be possible. Local connectivity
then guarantees that the agent always has an opinion as to the
relative plausibility of any two worlds among those in \(\cc_a(w)\)
that she considers possible. </p>

<p>
One consequence of local connectivity is that informationally
equivalent states can be stratified according to Grove's idea (Grove
1988) of concentric spheres: the most plausible worlds overall are
positioned on the innermost sphere, the next-most-plausible worlds are
positioned on the next-most-larger sphere, and so on, all the way out
to the positioning of the least-most-plausible worlds on the largest
sphere overall. (The number of worlds in our pictures of plausibility
models will always be finite&mdash;otherwise we could not draw them
according to our above-specified conventions&mdash;so it is always
possible to organize the worlds in our pictures into concentric
spheres in this way.) </p>

<p>
Grove spheres (Grove 1988) also suggest a natural method for static
belief revision in plausibility models: if the agent is told by a
completely trustworthy source that the actual world is among some
nonempty subset \(S\subseteq \cc_a(w)\) of her informationally
equivalent worlds, then she will restrict her attention to the worlds
in <i>S</i>. The most plausible worlds in <i>S</i> will be the worlds
she then considers to be most plausible overall, the
next-most-plausible worlds in <i>S</i> will be the worlds she then
considers to be next-most-plausible overall, and so on. That is, she
will &ldquo;reposition&rdquo; her system of spheres around the set
<i>S</i>. </p>

<p>
To see how all of this works, let us consider a simple example
scenario in which our two agents <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are discussing
the truth of two statements <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>. In the course of
the conversation, it becomes common knowledge that neither agent has
any information about <i>q</i> and hence neither knows whether
<i>q</i> is true, though, as it turns out, <i>q</i> happens to be
true. However, it is common knowledge that agent <i>b</i> is an expert
about an area of study whose body of work encompasses the question of
whether <i>p</i> is true. Further, agent <i>b</i> publicly delivers
his expert opinion: <i>p</i> is true. Agent <i>a</i> trusts agent
<i>b</i>&rsquo;s expertise and so she (agent <i>a</i>) comes to
believe that <i>p</i> is true. But her trust is not absolute: <i>a</i>
still maintains the possibility that agent <i>b</i> is wrong or
deceitful; hence she is willing to concede that her belief of <i>p</i>
is incorrect. Nevertheless, she does trust <i>b</i> for now and comes
to believe <i>p</i>. Unfortunately, her trust is misplaced: agent
<i>b</i> has knowingly lied; <i>p</i> is actually false. We picture
this scenario in Figure 8. </p>

<div class="figure" id="Fig8">
<img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" src="figure-plausibility.jpg" alt="" />

<div class="center">
<i>N</i>
</div>

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 8:</span> The pointed plausibility model
\((N,w_1)\). </p>
</div>

<p>
It is easy to see that the pointed plausibility model \((N,w_1)\)
clearly satisfies the property of local connectedness, so this is an
allowable picture. To see that this picture reasonably represents the
above-describe example scenario, first notice that we have one world
for each of the four possible truth assignments to the two letters
<i>p</i> and <i>q</i>. At the actual world \(w_1\), the letter
<i>p</i> is false and the letter <i>q</i> is true. Agent <i>a</i>
considers each of the four worlds to be informationally equivalent
(since she does not know with certainty which world is the actual
one); however, she considers the <i>p</i>-worlds to be strictly more
plausible than the \(\lnot p\)-worlds. This represents her belief that
<i>p</i> is true: each of the worlds she considers to be most
plausible overall satisfies <i>p</i>. Further, if she is told that
<i>p</i> is in fact false, she will restrict her attention to the
next-most-plausible \(\lnot p\)-worlds, thereby statically revising
her belief. It is in this sense that she trusts <i>b</i> (and so
believes <i>p</i> is true) but does not completely rule out the
possibility that he is incorrect or deceptive. Since <i>a</i> has no
information about <i>q</i>, each of her spheres&mdash;the inner
<i>p</i>-sphere and the outer \(\lnot p\)-sphere&mdash;contains both a
world at which <i>q</i> is true and a world at which <i>q</i> is
false. </p>

<p>
Now let us look at the attitudes of agent <i>b</i>. First, we see that
<i>b</i> has two connected components, one consisting of the
<i>p</i>-worlds and the other consisting of the \(\lnot p\)-worlds,
and these two components are not informationally equivalent. That is,
no <i>p</i>-world is informationally equivalent to a \(\lnot p\)-world
in the eyes of agent <i>b</i>. This tells us that <i>b</i>
conclusively knows whether <i>p</i> is true. Further, <i>a</i> knows
this is so (since each of <i>a</i>&rsquo;s informationally equivalent
worlds is one in which <i>b</i> knows whether <i>p</i> is true). Since
the actual world is a \(\lnot p\)-world, agent <i>b</i> in fact knows
<i>p</i> is false. Finally, we see that <i>b</i> knows that <i>a</i>
mistakenly believes that <i>p</i> is true: at each of <i>b</i>&rsquo;s
informationally equivalent worlds \(w_1\) and \(w_2\), agent <i>a</i>
believes that <i>p</i> is true (since <i>a</i>&rsquo;s most plausible
worlds overall, \(w_3\) and \(w_4\), both satisfy <i>p</i>). </p>

<p>
We are now ready for the formal definition of plausibility models.
This definition summarizes what we have seen so far. </p>

<div id="Def-Plaus">

<p>
<strong>Plausibility model.</strong> Given a nonempty set \(\sP\) of
propositional letters and a finite nonempty set \(\sA\) of agents, a
<em>plausibility model</em> is a structure 

\[
M=(W,\geq,V)
\]

 consisting
of</p>

<ul>

<li> a nonempty set <i>W</i> of <em>worlds</em> identifying the
possible states of affairs that might obtain, </li>

<li>a function \(\geq\) that assigns to each agent \(a\in\sA\) a
binary relation \(\geq_a\) on <i>W</i> satisfying the property of
<em>Plausibility</em> that we define shortly, and </li>

<li>a <em>propositional valuation</em> <i>V</i> mapping each
propositional letter to the set of worlds at which that letter is
true. </li>
</ul> We define the following relations, with a negation of a relation
indicated by placing a slash through the relational symbol:

<ul>

<li> <em>Converse plausibility</em>: \(w\leq_a v\) means we have
\(v\geq_a w\). </li>

<li><em>Strict plausibility</em>: \(w\gt_a v\) means we have \(w\geq_a
v\) and \(v\not\geq_a w\). </li>

<li><em>Strict converse plausibility</em>: \(w\lt_a v\) means we have
\(v\geq_a w\) and \(w\not\geq_a v\). </li>

<li><em>Equi-plausibility</em>: \(w\simeq_a v\) means we have
\(w\geq_a v\) and \(v\geq_a w\). </li>
</ul>

<p>
For each world <i>w</i> in <i>W</i> and agent <i>a</i>, we define the
<em>connected component</em> of <i>w</i>, also called the
<em><i>a</i>-connected component</em> if emphasizing <i>a</i> is
important, as follows: 

\[
\cc_a(w) \coloneqq \{ v\in W \mid w({\geq_a}\cup{\leq_a})^*v\} .
\]

 If \(\cc_a(w)=\cc_a(w)\), then we
say that <i>w</i> and <i>v</i> are <em>informationally equivalent</em>
(or that they are <em><i>a</i>-informationally equivalent</em>). The
relation \(\geq_a\) must satisfy the property of
<em>Plausibility</em>, which consists of the following three
items:</p>

<ul>

<li> \(\geq_a\) is reflexive and transitive; </li>

<li>\(\geq_a\) is <em>locally connected</em>: \(v\in\cc_a(w)\) implies
\(w\geq_a v\) or \(v\geq_a w\); and </li> 

<li>\(\geq_a\) is <em>converse well-founded</em>: for each nonempty set \(S\subseteq W\) of worlds, the set \[ \textstyle \min_a(S)\coloneqq\{w\in S\mid \forall v\in S:v\not\lt_a w\} \] of <em><i>a</i>-minimal elements</em> of <i>S</i> is itself nonempty.  </li>

</ul>

<p>
A <em>pointed plausibility model</em>, sometimes called a
<em>scenario</em> or a <em>situation</em>, is a pair \((M,w)\)
consisting of a plausibility model <i>M</i> and a world <i>w</i>
(called the <em>point</em>) that designates the state of affairs that
we (the formal modelers) currently assume to be actual. </p>
</div>

<p>
Intuitively, \(w \geq_a v\) means that <i>w</i> is no more plausible
than <i>v</i> according to agent <i>a</i>. Therefore, it is the
&ldquo;smaller&rdquo; worlds that are <em>more</em> plausible, so that
\(\min_a(\cc_w(w))\) is the set of worlds that agent <i>a</i>
considers to be <em>most plausible</em> of all worlds that are
informationally equivalent with <i>w</i>. </p> 

<p> Local connectivity, as we have seen, ensures that the agent has an opinion as to the relative plausibility of informationally equivalent worlds. Converse well-foundedness guarantees that the agent can always stratify informationally equivalent worlds in such a way that some worlds are the most plausible overall. As a result, we cannot have a situation where agent <i>a</i> has some sequence \[ w_1\gt_a w_2\gt_a w_3 \gt_a \cdots \] of worlds of strictly increasing plausibility, a circumstance in which it would be impossible to find &ldquo;the most plausible worlds&rdquo;. By forbidding such a circumstance, converse well-foundedness guarantees that the notion of &ldquo;the most plausible worlds&rdquo; is always well-defined.  </p>

<p id="PML-Language">
The collection of formulas interpreted on pointed plausibility models
generally contains at least the formulas coming from the language
\eqref{KBox} defined by the following grammar: </p> 

\[\begin{gather*}
F \ccoloneqq p \mid F \wedge F \mid \neg F \mid K_aF \mid \Box_a F \\

<p id="PML-Semantics">
The satisfaction relation \(\models\) between pointed plausibility
models and formulas of \eqref{KBox} is defined as follows. </p>

<ul>

<li>\(M,w\models p\) holds if and only if \(w\in V(p)\).</li>

<li>\(M,w\models F\land G\) holds if and only if both \(M,w\models F\)

<p>
For each \eqref{KBox}-formula <i>F</i> and plausibility model \(M =

<p>
of worlds at which <i>F</i> is true. If <i>M</i> is fixed, we may
simply write \(\sem{F}\) without the subscript <i>M</i>. </p>

<p>
\(K_aF\) is assigned the reading &ldquo;agent <i>a</i> has information
that <i>F</i> is true&rdquo;. One may consider \(K_a\) as a kind of
knowledge, though not the kind usually possessed by actual, real-life
agents (because it satisfies properties such as closure under logical
consequence that are typically not satisfied in practice).
Intuitively, possession of information of <i>F</i> is belief in
<i>F</i> that persists upon receipt of <em>any</em> further
information, even information that is <em>not true</em>. This kind of
knowledge is therefore infallible and indefeasible. </p>

<p>
We assign \(\Box_aF\) the reading &ldquo;agent <i>a</i> defeasibly
knows <i>F</i>&rdquo;. This is a weak notion of knowledge studied by
Lehrer and Paxson (1969) and by Lehrer (1990, 2000) and formalized by
Stalnaker (1980, 2006). Intuitively, defeasible knowledge of <i>F</i>
is belief in <i>F</i> that persists upon receipt of any further true
information: the agent believes <i>F</i> and, if told any further
<em>true</em> information, she will continue to believe <i>F</i>.
Defeasible knowledge is sometimes also called &ldquo;safe
belief&rdquo;. </p>

<p id="Conditional-B">
The dual form of information possession \(K_aF\), written \(\hat K_a

\]

<p>
which has the meaning that <i>F</i> is consistent with agent
<i>a</i>&rsquo;s information. We use this to define a notion of
<em>conditional belief</em>: </p> 

\[
B_a^GF \mbox{ denotes } \hat K_aG \to \hat K_a(G\land\Box_a(G\to F)).

<p>
which is assigned the reading &ldquo;agent <i>a</i> believes <i>F</i>

\(B_a(F|G)\). Though the meaning of \(B_a^GF\) can be derived from the
above definitions, the following provides a more intuitive
interpretation. </p>

<strong>Theorem.</strong> For each pointed plausibility model
\((M,w)\), we have: 

 \[ \textstyle M,w\models B_a^GF \quad\text{iff}\quad \min_a(\sem{G}_M\cap\cc_a(w))\subseteq\sem{F}_M ; \] 

 that is, agent <i>a</i> believes
<i>F</i> conditional on <i>G</i> at world <i>w</i> if and only if
<i>F</i> is true at the most plausible <i>G</i>-worlds that are
consistent with <i>a</i>&rsquo;s information. </p>
</div>

<p>
This theorem tell us that to see what an agent believes conditional on
<i>G</i>, all we need to do is look at the agent&rsquo;s most
plausible <i>G</i>-worlds. In this way, conditional belief has the
agent &ldquo;recenter&rdquo; her system of spheres over the set of all
worlds at which <i>G</i> is true. Conditional belief thereby
implements static belief revision: to see what agent <i>a</i> believes
after statically revising her beliefs by <i>G</i> we simply see what
it is she believes conditional on <i>G</i>. Thus \(B_a^GF\) says that
agent <i>a</i> believes <i>F</i> after statically revising her beliefs
by <i>G</i>. </p>

<p>
The notion of conditional belief allows us to connect the notions
knowledge possession \(K_a\) and defeasible knowledge \(\Box_a\) with
the defeasibility analysis of knowledge, as indicated by the following
result. </p>

\]

<p>
So to see what the agent believes <em>unconditionally</em>, we simply
conditionalize her beliefs on the trivial condition \(\top\), which is
true everywhere. It is then easy to see that we have the following.

We conclude this section with the axiomatic theory characterizing
those formulas that are valid in all plausibility models. Since we can

plausibility models. That is, for each \eqref{KBox}-formula <i>F</i>,
we have that \(\KBox\vdash F\) if and only if \(\sC_*\models F\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Instead of taking information possession \(K_a\) and defeasible
knowledge \(\Box_a\) as the basic propositional attitudes, one may
instead choose conditional belief statements \(B_a^GF\). This choice
gives the theory \(\CDL\) of Conditional Doxastic Logic. See
 <a href="appendix-J-CDL.html">Appendix J</a>
 for details. </p>

<p>
We may define a number of additional propositional attitudes beyond
conditional belief \(B_a^GF\), defeasible knowledge \(\Box_aF\), and
information possession \(K_aF\). We take a brief look at a two of
these that have important connections with the Belief Revision
literature. </p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li> The <em>unary revision operator</em> \(*_aF\) has the semantics:

	  \[M,w\models *_aF
	      \mbox{ means }
	  M,w\models F \mbox{ and } M,v\not\models F
	  \mbox{ for all } v\lt_a w\]

 That is, to say that \(*_aF\) is true at world <i>w</i>
means that <i>F</i> is true at <i>w</i> and that <i>F</i> is false at
any world <i>v</i> that agent <i>a</i> ranks strictly more plausible.
So to have \(*_aF\) true at <i>w</i> says that <i>w</i> will be among
the most plausible after the agent undergoes a belief revision by
<i>F</i>. The unary revision operator \(*_aF\) therefore picks out the
worlds that will make up agent <i>a</i>&rsquo;s theory of beliefs
after revision by <i>F</i>. As such, we have 

	  \[
M,w\models B_a^FG 	      \quad\text{ iff }    	  M,w\models K_a(*_aF\to G),
\]

 which says
that agent <i>a</i> believes <i>G</i> after revision by <i>F</i> if
and only if she knows that <i>G</i> is a consequence of her theory
after revision by <i>F</i>.
<br />
<br />
</li>

<li id="Degree-n-Belief"> For each natural number <i>n</i>, we have a
<em>degree-<i>n</i> belief operator</em> \(B_a^nF\). To define the
semantics of these operators, we first define formulas \(b_a^n\) for
each natural number <i>n</i> according to the following: 

	\[\begin{align*}
	b_a^0 &amp;= *_a\top, \\
	b_a^{n+1} &amp;=
	*_a(\lnot b_a^0\land \lnot b_a^1\land\cdots\land\lnot b_a^n) .
	\end{align*}\]

\(b_a^0\) is true at the worlds the agent <i>a</i> ranks most
plausible overall, \(b_a^1\) is true at the worlds the agent <i>a</i>
ranks next-most plausible after the \(b_a^0\)-worlds, \(b_a^2\) is
picks out the next-most plausible after the \(b_a^1\)-worlds, and so
on. The \(b_a^n\)-worlds thereby pick out agent <i>a</i>&rsquo;s
&ldquo;degree-<i>n</i> theory of belief&rdquo;, which is the
collection of beliefs the agent will hold after giving up all theories
of lesser degree. This setup allows us to realize Spohn's (1988)
notion of &ldquo;degrees of belief&rdquo;: 

	  \[
M,w\models B_a^nF
	      \mbox{ means }    M,w\models K_a(b_a^n\to F)\land \bigwedge_{i\lt n}\lnot	  K_a(b_a^i\to F),
\]

 which says
that agent <i>a</i> believes <i>F</i> to degree <i>n</i> if and only
if she knows it follows from her degree-<i>n</i> theory and she does
not know it to follow from any of her theories of lesser degree. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="LogiDoxaActiActiPrioUpda">4.4 The Logic of Doxastic Actions: Action-priority update</h3>

<p>
The theories and operators we have seen so far all concern
<em>static</em> belief change. We now wish to turn to <em>dynamic</em>
belief change. For this the approach follows the typical pattern in
Dynamic Epistemic Logic: we take a given static theory (in this case
\(\KBox\)) and we add action model-style modalities to create the
dynamic theory. When we did this before in the case of basic
multi-modal epistemic and doxastic logic, the relational structure of
the added action models matched the relational structure of the models
of the theory&mdash;Kripke models. The structural match between action
models and finite Kripke models is not accidental: the semantics of
action model modalities (as explained by the
 <a href="#AM-cons">BMS product update</a>)
 uses the same Kripke model-based notion of agent uncertainty over
objects (i.e., the &ldquo;worlds&rdquo;) to describe agent uncertainty
over action model objects (i.e., the &ldquo;events&rdquo;). Both
uncertainties are represented using the same kind of structure: the
binary possibility relation \(R_a\). </p>

<p>
For the present theory of conditional belief \(B_a^FG\), defeasible
knowledge \(\Box_aF\), and information possession \(K_aF\), we take a
similar approach: we define <em>plausibility action models</em>, which
are action model-type objects whose relational structure matches the
relational structure of the models of this theory&mdash;plausibility
models. Since a finite plausibility model has the form \((W,\geq,V)\),
our intuition from the Kripke model case suggests that plausibility
action models should have the form \((E,\geq,\pre)\), with <i>E</i> a
finite nonempty set of events, \(\geq\) a function giving a
plausibility relation \(\geq_a\) for each agent <i>a</i>, and \(\pre\)
a precondition function as before. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Plausibility action model.</strong> Given a set of formulas
\(\Lang\) and a finite nonempty set \(\sA\) of agents, a
<em>plausibility action model</em> is a structure 

\[ A=(E,\geq,\pre) \]

consisting of</p>

<ul>

<li> a nonempty finite set <i>E</i> of the possible communicative
<em>events</em> that might occur, </li>

<li>a function \(\geq\) that assigns to each agent \(a\in\sA\) a
binary relation \(\geq_a\) on <i>E</i> satisfying the property of
Plausibility defined earlier, and </li>

<li>a function \(\pre:E\to\Lang\) that assigns to each event <i>e</i>
in <i>E</i> a formula \(\pre(e)\in\Lang\) called the
<em>precondition</em> of <i>e</i>. Intuitively, the precondition is
announced when the event occurs. </li>
</ul>

<p>
A <em>pointed plausibility action model</em>, sometimes also called an
<em>action</em>, is a pair \((A,e)\) consisting of a plausibility
action model <i>A</i> and an event <i>e</i> in <i>A</i> that is called
the <em>point</em>. In drawing plausibility action models, events are
drawn as rectangles, a point (if any) is indicated with a double
rectangle, and arrows are drawn using dashes (as for plausibility
models). We use many of the same drawing and terminological
conventions for plausibility action models that we use for (pointed)
plausibility models.</p>
</div>

<p>
As expected, the main difference between plausibility action models
and basic action models is that the agent-specific component (i.e.,
the function \(\geq\) giving the agent-specific relation \(\geq_a\)).
In constructing new plausibility models based on plausibility action
models, we may follow a construction similar to the
 <a href="#AM-cons">product update</a>.
 To make this work, our main task is to describe how the plausibility
relation \(\geq_a\) in the resultant plausibility model \(M[A]\) is to
be determined in terms of the plausibility relations coming from the
given initial plausibility model <i>M</i> and the plausibility action
model <i>A</i>. For this it will be helpful to consider an example.

<span class="figlabel">Figure 9:</span> The pointed plausibility
action model \((\rPub(q),e)\) for the revisable public announcement of
<i>q</i> (also called the &ldquo;lexicographic upgrade by
<i>q</i>&rdquo; by van Benthem 2007). </p>
</div>

<p>
Figure 9 depicts \((\rPub(q),e)\), a pointed plausibility action model
consisting of two events: the event <i>f</i> in which \(\lnot q\) is
announced and the event <i>e</i> in which <i>q</i> is announced. Event
<i>e</i> is the event that actually occurs. For each agent <i>a</i>
(coming from the full set of agents \(\sA\)), event <i>e</i> is
strictly more plausible. We adopt the
 <a href="#Plaus-conventions">same drawing conventions</a>
 for plausibility action models that we did for plausibility models:
one- and two-way arrows, reflexive and transitive closures, and the
requirement of local connectedness. (Well-foundedness follows because
the set <i>E</i> of events is finite.) Accordingly, Figure 9
implicitly contains reflexive dashed arrows for each agent at each
event. </p>

<p>
\((\rPub(q),e)\) has the following intuitive effect: the public
announcement of <i>q</i> (i.e., event <i>e</i>) occurs and this is
common knowledge; however, the agents still maintain the possibility
that the negation \(\lnot q\) was announced (i.e., event <i>f</i>
occurred). In effect, the agents will come to believe <i>q</i>
(because the announcement of this was most plausible), but they will
nevertheless maintain the less plausible possibility that <i>q</i> is
false. This allows the agents to accept the announced formula <i>q</i>
but with some caution: they can still revise their beliefs if they
later learn that <i>q</i> is false. </p>

<p>
The &ldquo;action-priority update&rdquo; is the analog of the product
update for plausibility models. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Action-priority update (Baltag and Smets 2008b).</strong> Let

the plausibility model 

\[ M[A]=(W[A],{\geq}[A],V[A]) \]

 is defined via the

follows:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>
An action \((A,e)\) operates on an initial situation \((M,w)\)
satisfying \(M,w\models\pre^A(e)\) via the action-priority update to
produce the resultant situation \((M[A],(w,e))\). Note that we may
write the plausibility relation \(\mathrel{{\geq}[A]_a}\) for agent
<i>a</i> after the action-priority update by <i>A</i> simply as
\(\geq_a\) when the meaning is clear from context.</p>
</div>

<p id="APUL-Language">
We now turn to <em>Action-Priority Update Logic</em> (a.k.a., <em>the
Logic of Doxastic Actions</em>). To begin, we define the language
\eqref{APUL} of Action-Priority Update Logic along with the set
\(\PAM_*\) of pointed plausibility action models having preconditions
in the language \eqref{APUL} according to the following recursive
grammar: </p> 

\[\begin{gather*}
F  \ccoloneqq  p \mid F \wedge F \mid \neg F \mid K_aF \mid \Box_aF \mid [A,e]F \\ 
\small p \in \sP,\; a \in \sA,\; (A,e)\in\PAM_* 
\taglabel{APUL} 
\end{gather*} \]

<p>
The satisfaction relation \(\models\) between pointed plausibility
models and formulas of \eqref{APUL} is the smallest extension of the
above-defined satisfaction relation \(\models\) for \eqref{KBox}
satisfying the following: </p>

<ul>

<li> \(M,w\models[A,e]G\) holds if and only if
\(M,w\not\models\pre(e)\) or \(M[A],(w,e)\models G\), where the model
\(M[A]\) is given by the action-priority update. </li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to the revisable public announcement
 (<a href="#Fig9">Figure 9</a>),
 there are a number of interesting pointed plausibility action models.
</p>

<p>
<span class="figlabel">Figure 11:</span> The pointed plausibility
action model \((\rPri_G(q),e)\) for the private announcement of
<i>q</i> to the group of agents <i>G</i>. </p>
</div>

<p>
Figure 11 depicts the private announcement of <i>q</i> to a group of
agents <i>G</i>. This consists of two events: the event <i>e</i> in
which <i>q</i> is announced and the event <i>f</i> in which the
propositional constant for truth \(\top\) is announced. For agents
outside the group <i>G</i>, the most plausible event is the one in
which the \(\top\) is announced; for agents in the group, the most
plausible event is the one in which <i>q</i> is announced. In reality,
the announcement of <i>q</i> (i.e., event <i>e</i>) occurs. Since the
propositional constant for truth \(\top\) is uninformative, the agents
outside of <i>G</i> will come to believe that the situation is as it
was before. The agents inside <i>G</i>, however, will come to believe
<i>q</i>. </p>

<p>
The plausibility action model version of the private announcement
(Figure 11) is almost identical to the action model version of the
private announcement
 (<a href="#Fig3">Figure 3</a>).
 This is because action models are easily converted into plausibility
action models: simply change the arrows to dashed arrows. In this way,
we readily obtain plausibility action models from our existing action
models. In particular, we can obtain plausibility actions for a public
announcement by converting
 <a href="#Fig4">Figure 4</a>,
 for a semi-private announcement by converting
 <a href="#Fig5">Figure 5</a>,
 and for a misleading private announcement by converting
 <a href="#Fig6">Figure 6</a>.
 </p>

<p>
Finally, van Benthem (2007) studied two important operations on
multi-agent plausibility models that are representable using the
action-priority update. </p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li> The <em>lexicographic upgrade</em> \([\Up F]G\) (Rott 1989; van
Benthem 2007): after changing the plausibility relation so that
<i>F</i>-worlds are ranked over \(\lnot F\)-worlds but worlds within
each of the <i>F</i>- and \(\lnot F\)-regions are ranked as before,
<i>G</i> is true. The lexicographic upgrade by <i>F</i> is just the
revisable public announcement of <i>F</i>
 (<a href="#Fig9">Figure 9</a>):
 

	 \[M,w\models[\Up F]G
	     \quad\text{ iff  }
	 M,w\models[\rPub(F),e]G.\]

 </li>

<li> The <em>conservative upgrade</em> \([\up F]G\) (Boutilier 1993;
van Benthem 2007): after changing the plausibility relation so that
the best <i>F</i>-worlds are ranked over all other worlds but the
rankings are otherwise left unchanged, <i>G</i> is true. We note that
in the case where the set \(\sA\) of agents consists of just the one
agent <i>a</i>, we have 

\[\begin{align*}
	  M,w\models[\up F]G\quad &amp;	  \text{ iff } 	  M,w\models[\Up*_aF]G	  \\
	                          &amp;	  \text{ iff } 	  M,w\models[\rPub(*_aF),e]
\end{align*}\]

 which says that the conservative
upgrade by <i>F</i> is equal to the lexicographic upgrade by \(*_aF\)
in the case of a single agent <i>a</i>. This makes sense: \(*_aF\)
picks out the most plausible <i>F</i>-worlds, and then the
lexicographic upgrade \(\Up *_aF\) ranks these most plausible
<i>F</i>-worlds as most plausible overall and leaves all other
rankings as before. In the multi-agent case with <i>n</i> agents, we
observe that a plausibility action model with \(2^n\) actions is
equivalent to \(\Up F\). In particular, let 

	\[
	\CU(F) \coloneqq (E,\geq,\pre)
	\]

 be the
plausibility action model defined as follows:

<ul>

<li> \(E\coloneqq\{e_I \mid I\subseteq\sA\}\) &mdash; there is one
event \(e_I\) for each (possibly empty) subset \(I\subseteq\sA\) of
agents, </li>

<li> \(e_I\geq_a e_J\) if and only if \(a\in J\) &mdash; event \(e_J\)
is of equal or grader plausibility according to <i>a</i> iff <i>a</i>
is a member of <i>J</i>, and </li>

<li> \(\pre(e_I) \coloneqq (\bigwedge_{i\in I}*_i F)\land
(\bigwedge_{j\in(\sA-I)}\lnot *_jF)\) &mdash; event \(e_I\) picks out
the worlds that are best <i>F</i>-worlds for agents in <i>I</i> and
not best <i>F</i>-worlds for agents not in <i>I</i>. </li>
</ul> Intuitively, this plausibility action model has each agent
<i>a</i> split the events into two categories: those that are best
<i>F</i>-worlds according to <i>a</i> make up the first category and
are ranked highest, and those that are not best <i>F</i>-worlds
according to <i>a</i> make up the second category and are ranked
strictly less plausible than the first category. In particular, since
we have \(e_I\leq_a e_J\) if and only if <i>a</i> is in <i>I</i>, it
follows that:

<ul>

<li>if \(i\in I\cap J\), then \(e_I\simeq_a e_J\);</li>

<li>if \(i\in I-J\), then \(e_I\lt_a e_J\);</li>

<li>if \(i\in J-I\), then \(e_I\gt_a e_J\);</li>

<li>if \(i\in \sA-(I\cup J)\), then \(e_I\simeq_a e_J\).</li>
</ul> So the \(e_I\)&rsquo;s having <i>i</i> in <i>I</i> make up the
first category and are all ranked most plausible overall by <i>a</i>,
and the \(e_I\)&rsquo;s not having <i>i</i> in <i>I</i> make up the
second category are ranked strictly less plausible by <i>a</i>. The
preconditions are arranged so that any two events are pairwise
inconsistent: if \(I\neq J\), then <i>I</i> and <i>J</i> differ on at
least one agent <i>a</i> and therefore they differ on whether their
precondition asserts \(*_aF\) or its negation \(\lnot *_aF\). Further,
the preconditions of the events exhaust all possibilities: given a
world <i>w</i> of a plausibility model, there is a (possibly empty)
set of agents <i>I</i> such that the agents in <i>I</i> rank <i>w</i>
as a best <i>F</i>-world and the agents not in <i>I</i> do not rank
<i>w</i> as a best <i>F</i>-world; as such, world <i>w</i> satisfies
the precondition of \(e_I\) for the set <i>I</i> in question.
Therefore, the events in \(\CU(F)\) partition the worlds of a given
input plausibility model into a number of pieces, one piece for each
subset \(I\subseteq\sA\). The piece of the given model corresponding
to the subset <i>I</i> is picked out by event \(e_I\) and consists of
those worlds in the given model that satisfy the precondition
\(\pre(e_I)\); these are the worlds that are best <i>F</i>-worlds
according to the agents in <i>I</i> and not best <i>F</i>-worlds
according to the agents not in <i>I</i>. So we see that \(\CU(F)\)
breaks up the model into various pieces based on which of the agents
think the worlds in the given piece are best <i>F</i>-worlds, has the
agents rank the pieces so that each agent has her best <i>F</i>-worlds
outrank all other worlds, and otherwise leaves the ranking as it was.
Accordingly, it is not too hard to see that we have 

	  \[
M,w\models[\up F]G
	      \quad\text{ iff }
	  M,w\models\bigvee_{I\subseteq\sA}[\CU(F),e_I]G
	      
\mbox{ (general case),}
\]

 which
says that the conservative upgrade by <i>F</i> is equal to the
action-priority update brought about by the pointed plausibility
action model \((\CU(F),e_I)\) for some subset \(I\subseteq\sA\). As
already stated, a world in the initial model will satisfy the
precondition of exactly one event \(e_J\). Therefore, the truth at
<i>w</i> of the disjunction \(\bigvee_{I\subseteq\sA}[\CU(F),e_I]G\)
is determined by evaluating the truth at <i>w</i> of the disjunct
\([\CU(F),e_J]G\) for the particular <i>J</i> corresponding to
<i>w</i>. </li>
</ul>

<p>
We now study the axiomatic theory of Action-Priority Update Logic.

</div>

<p>
The first three reduction axioms are identical to the corresponding
reduction axioms for \(\EAL\). The fourth \(\APUL\) reduction axiom is
almost identical to the fourth \(\EAL\) reduction axiom. In
particular, the fourth \(\EAL\) reduction axiom, which reads </p>

\[
\textstyle
[A,e]K_aG\leftrightarrow(\pre(e)\to\bigwedge_{e R_af}K_a[A,f]G),
\]

<p>
differs only in the conjunction on the right-hand side: the \(\EAL\)
axiom has its conjunction over events related to <i>e</i> via the
Kripke model-style relation \(R_a\), whereas the \(\APUL\) axiom has
its conjunction over events related to <i>e</i> via the plausibility
model-style relation \(\simeq_a\). </p>

<p>
The fifth \(\APUL\) reduction axiom is new. This axiom captures the
essence of the action-priority update: for an agent to have defeasible
knowledge after an action, she must have information about what
happens as a result of more plausible actions and, further, she must
have defeasible knowledge about the outcome of equi-plausible actions.
The reason for this follows from the definition of the resulting
plausibility relation \({\geq}[A]_a\). As a reminder, this is defined
by setting \((v_1,f_1)\mathrel{{\geq}[A]_a}(v_2,f_2)\) if and only if
we have one of the following: </p>

<ul>

<li> \(f_1\gt_a f_2\) and \(\cc_a(v_1)=\cc_a(v_2)\) &mdash; events of
strictly differing plausibility are applied to informationally
equivalent worlds; or </li>

<li>\(f_1\simeq_a f_2\) and \(v_1\geq_a v_2\) &mdash; equi-plausible
events are applied to informationally equivalent worlds of differing
plausibility. </li>
</ul>

<p>
Looking to the fifth \(\APUL\) reduction axiom, the conjunct
\(\bigwedge_{e\gt_a f}K_a[A,f]G\) says that <i>G</i> is true whenever
an event of plausibility strictly greater than <i>e</i> is applied to
a world within <i>a</i>&rsquo;s current connected component. This
tells us that <i>G</i> is true at worlds having greater plausibility
in light of the first bulleted item above. The other conjunct
\(\bigwedge_{e\simeq_a f}\Box_a[A,f]G)\) of the fifth \(\APUL\)
reduction axiom says that <i>G</i> is true whenever an event
equi-plausible with <i>e</i> is applied to world of equal or greater
plausibility within <i>a</i>&rsquo;s current connected component. This
tells us that <i>G</i> is true at worlds having greater or equal
plausibility in light of the second bulleted item above. Taken
together, since these two bulleted items define when it is that a
world has equal or greater plausibility in the resultant model
\(M[A]\), the truth of these two conjuncts at an initial situation
\((M,w)\) at which \((A,e)\) is executable implies that <i>G</i> is
true at all worlds of equal or greater plausibility than the actual
world \((w,e)\) of the resultant model \(M[A]\). That is, we have
\(M[A],(w,e)\models\Box_a G\) and therefore that \(M,w\models[A,e]G\).
This explains the right-to-left direction of the fifth \(\APUL\)
reduction axiom. The left-to-right direction is explained similarly.
</p>

<p>
As was the case for \(\EAL\), the \(\APUL\) reduction axioms allow us
to &ldquo;reduce&rdquo; each formula containing plausibility action
models to a provably equivalent formula whose plausibility action
model modalities appear before formulas of lesser complexity, allowing
us to eliminate plausibility action model modalities completely via a
sequence of provable equivalences. As a consequence, we have the
following. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>APUL Reduction Theorem.</strong> Every <i>F</i> in the
language \eqref{APUL} is \(\APUL\)-provably equivalent to a formula
\(F^\circ\) coming from the plausibility action model-free modal
language \eqref{KBox}.</p>
</div>

<p>
Once we have proved \(\APUL\) is sound, the Reduction Theorem leads us
to axiomatic completeness via the known completeness of the underlying
modal theory \(\KBox\). </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>\(\APUL\) Soundness and Completeness.</strong> \(\APUL\) is
sound and complete with respect to the collection \(\sC_*\) of pointed
plausibility action models. That is, for each \eqref{APUL}-formula
<i>F</i>, we have that \(\APUL\vdash F\) if and only if \(\sC_*\models
F\).</p>
</div>

<p>
As is the case for \(\EAL\), it is possible to combine two consecutive
actions into a single action. All that is required is an appropriate
notion of plausibility action model composition. </p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Plausibility action model composition.</strong> The
<em>composition</em> \(A\circ B=(E,\geq,\pre)\) of plausibility action
models \(A=(E^A,\geq^A,\pre^A)\) and \(B=(E^B,\geq^B,\pre^B)\) is
defined as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li> \(E=E^A\times E^B\) &mdash; composed events are pairs \((e,f)\)
of constituent events; </li>

<li>\((e_1,f_1)\geq_a (e_2,f_2)\) if and only if one of the following
obtains:

<ul>

<li> \(e_1\geq_a e_2\) and \(\cc_a(f_1)=\cc_a(f_2)\) &mdash; events of
differing plausibility are followed by informationally equivalent
events, or </li>

<li> \(e_1\simeq_a e_2\) and \(f_1\geq_a f_2\) &mdash; equi-plausible
events are followed by informationally equivalent events of differing
plausibility; </li>
</ul> </li>

<li>\(\pre((e_1,e_2)) = \pre^A(e_1)\land[A,e_1]\pre^B(e_2)\) &mdash; a
composed event is executable iff the first constituent is executable
and, after it occurs, the second constituent is executable as well.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Composition Theorem.</strong> Each instance of the following
schemes is \(\APUL\)-derivable.</p>

<ul>

<li> Composition Scheme: \([A,e][B,f]G\leftrightarrow[A\circ
B,(e,f)]G\) </li>

<li> Associativity Scheme: \([A\circ B,(e,f)][C,g]H \leftrightarrow
[A,e][B\circ C,(f,g)]H]\)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
It is also possible to add valuation-changing substitutions (i.e.,
&ldquo;factual changes&rdquo;) to plausibility action models. This is
done exactly as it is done for action models proper: substitutions are
added to plausibility action models, the action-priority update is
modified to account for substitutions in the semantics, and the first
reduction axiom is changed to account for substitutions in the
axiomatics. See
 <a href="appendix-G-EAL.html">Appendix G</a>
 for details. </p> <!-- ZZZ -->

<h3 id="EvidDynaJustBeli">4.5 Evidential dynamics and justified belief</h3>

<p>
One development in DEL is work aimed toward building logics of
evidence, belief, and knowledge for use in Formal Epistemology. </p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li> Vel&aacute;zquez-Quesada (2009) and van Benthem and
Vel&aacute;zquez-Quesada (2010) study logics of inference and update.
These have models containing worlds that explicitly list the formulas
of which agents are &ldquo;aware&rdquo;, like awareness logics (Fagin
et al. 1995), except that DEL-style modalities can change these
awareness sets, allowing agents to increase the formulas of which they
are aware and make inferences with these formulas over time. In this
sense, the &ldquo;awareness sets&rdquo; may be though of as evidence
for the formulas the agents presently know. </li>

<li> Baltag, Renne, and Smets (2014) study a logic of
&ldquo;conclusive&rdquo; (or &ldquo;good&rdquo;) evidence based on a
combination of plausibility models with an adaptation of the syntactic
bookkeeping mechanisms of Justification Logic (Artemov 2008; Artemov
and Fitting 2012). They argue that their work generalizes the
awareness logics of Vel&aacute;zquez-Quesada (2009) and van Benthem
and Vel&aacute;zquez-Quesada (2010) and better addresses updates with
higher-order information. </li>

<li> A different approach to evidence in Dynamic Epistemic Logic was
proposed by van Benthem and Pacuit (2011a,b) and studied further in
van Benthem, Ferna&#769;ndez-Dunque, and Pacuit (2012, 2014). This
approach is much less syntactic than the Justification Logic-style
approaches, focusing instead on the semantic notion of modal
&ldquo;neighborhood&rdquo; (or &ldquo;minimal&rdquo;) models that have
been repurposed with an evidential twist. </li>
</ul>

<p>
We refer the reader to
 <a href="appendix-K-evidence.html">Appendix K</a>
 for further details. </p>

<h2 id="ProbUpdaDynaEpisLogi">5. Probabilistic update in Dynamic Epistemic Logic</h2>

<p>
Dynamic Epistemic Logics that incorporate probability have been
studied by a number of authors. Van Benthem (2003), Kooi (2003),
Baltag and Smets (2008a), and van Benthem, Gerbrandy, and Kooi (2009b)
studied logics of finite probability spaces. Sack (2009) extended the
work of Kooi (2003) and van Benthem, Gerbrandy, and Kooi (2009b) to
full probability spaces (based on &sigma;-algebras of events). Of
these, we mention two in particular: </p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li> Baltag and Smets (2008a) develop logics of finite probability
spaces that connect three areas of work: the
Popper&ndash;R&eacute;yni&ndash;de Finetti extension of Bayesian
probabilistic conditionalization, the theory of Belief Revision, and
Dynamic Epistemic Logic. This leads to a definition of an
action-model-style probabilistic product update that permits update on
events of probability zero (which is required by belief revision).
</li>

<li>Van Benthem, Gerbrandy, and Kooi (2009b) have a different approach
with action-model-style probabilistic update that takes into account
three sources of probabilistic information: prior probabilities,
occurrence probabilities, and observation probabilities. </li>
</ul>

<p>
We refer the reader to
 <a href="appendix-L-probability.html">Appendix L</a>
 for further details. </p>

<h2 id="ApplDynaEpisLogi">6. Applications of Dynamic Epistemic Logic</h2>

<h3 id="PrefDyna">6.1 Preference dynamics</h3>

<p>
DEL-style model-changing operators have been applied by a number of
researchers to the study of preferences, preference change, and
related notions. We refer the reader to
 <a href="appendix-M-preferences.html">Appendix M</a>
 for further information, which mentions the work of van Benthem et
al. (2009), van Benthem and Liu (2007), Liu (2008), Yamada (2007a,b,
2008), van Eijck (2008), van Eijck and Sietsma (2010), van Benthem,
Girard, and Roy (2009c), and Liu (2011). </p>

<h3 id="ConnTempLogi">6.2 Connections with Temporal Logic</h3>

<p>
Action model-style modalities \([A,e]\) of Dynamic Epistemic Logic
have a temporally suggestive reading: &ldquo;<em>after</em> action
\((A,e)\), formula <i>F</i> is true&rdquo;. This
&ldquo;before-after&rdquo; reading suggests, naturally enough, that
time passes as actions occur. The semantics of action models supports
this suggestion: determining the truth of an action model formula
\([A,e]F\) in a model&mdash;the model &ldquo;before&rdquo; the
action&mdash;requires us to apply the model-transforming operation
induced by the action \((A,e)\) and then see whether <i>F</i> holds in
the model that results &ldquo;after&rdquo; the action. Channeling
Parikh and Ramanujam (2003) some DEL authors further this suggestion
by using the temporally charged word &ldquo;history&rdquo; to refer to
a sequence of pointed Kripke models brought about by the occurrence of
a sequence of model-transforming operations. All of this seems to
point to the existence of a direct relationship between the occurrence
of model-transforming actions and the passage of time: time passes as
these actions occur. However, the formal languages introduced so far
do not have a built-in means for directly expressing the passage of
time, and so, as a consequence, the axiomatic theories developed above
are silent on the relationship between the flow of time and the
occurrence of model-changing actions. This leaves open the possibility
that, within the context of these theories, the passage of time and
the occurrence of actions need not necessarily relate as we might
otherwise suspect. </p>

<p>
For more on this, we refer the interested reader to
 <a href="appendix-N-time.html">Appendix N</a>,
 which mentions a number of studies that bring some method of
time-keeping within the scope of the Dynamic Epistemic Logic approach:
the work of Sack (2007, 2008, 2010), Yap (2006, 2011), Hoshi (2009),
Hoshi and Yap (2009), van Benthem, Gerbrandy, and Pacuit (2007), van
Benthem et al. (2009a), D&eacute;gremont, Lo&#776;we, and Witzel
(2011), and Renne, Sack, and Yap (2009, 2015). </p>

<h3 id="ConnMainEpis">6.3 Connections to mainstream Epistemology</h3>

<p>
A number of works utilize tools and techniques from Dynamic Epistemic
Logic for formal reasoning on topics in mainstream Epistemology. </p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li> Baltag and Smets (2008b) use plausibility models
 (<a href="#PlauModeBeliChan">Section 4.3</a>)
 and The Logic of Doxastic Actions
 (<a href="#LogiDoxaActiActiPrioUpda">Section 4.4</a>)
 to capture a number of notions of knowledge, including Aumann&rsquo;s
partition-based notion and Stalnaker&rsquo;s (2006) formalization of
Lehrer&rsquo;s (1990, 2000) defeasibility analysis of knowledge. </li>

<li>Building on the work mentioned in the previous item, Baltag,
Renne, and Smets (2014) show that a theory \(\JBG\) of Justified
Belief with &ldquo;Good&rdquo; Evidence can be used to reason about
certain examples from mainstream Epistemology. For example, Gettier
(1963) constructs a famous counterexample to the claim that
&ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; may be equated with &ldquo;justified true
belief&rdquo; (i.e., justified <em>correct</em> belief). In this
example, an agent&mdash;let us call her <i>a</i>&mdash;has evidence
for a propositional letter <i>f</i>, concludes via logical deduction
that \(b\lor f\), and therefore has evidence for this disjunction;
however, unknown to the agent, <i>f</i> is false but <i>b</i> is true.
She therefore has justified true belief but not knowledge that \(b\lor
f\) is true (since her reason for believing this disjunction is based
on her belief in the wrong disjunct). This example is easily
reconstructed in \(\JBG\), providing one formal account of an agent
whose justified belief is correct and yet the agent does not have
knowledge (even in a weakly defeasible sense). See
 <a href="appendix-K-evidence.html">Appendix K</a>
 for additional details. </li>

<li>Baltag, Renne, and Smets (2012) analyze a Gettier-like example due
to Lehrer (1990, 2000) in a variant of \(\JBG\) that includes dynamic
operations for addition of evidence, stepwise logical reasoning,
announcement-like addition of evidence with world elimination, and
evidence-based plausibility upgrades of worlds. </li>

<li>Fitch&rsquo;s paradox (Fitch 1963) concerns the seemingly strange
result that the existence of unknown truths implies not all truths are
knowable. Following the suggestion of van Benthem (2004), Balbiani et
al. (2008) equate &ldquo;knowability&rdquo; with &ldquo;being known
after some announcement&rdquo; and show using Arbitrary Public
Announcement Logic (see
 <a href="appendix-E-PAL.html">Appendix E</a>)
 that it is jointly inconsistent to assume that &ldquo;<i>p</i> is an
unknown truth&rdquo; and that &ldquo;all truths are knowable&rdquo;.
We refer the reader to the discussions in van Benthem (2004), Balbiani
et al. (2008), and Brogaard and Salerno (2012) for further details.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Conc">7. Conclusion</h2>

<p>
We have surveyed the literature of Dynamic Epistemic Logic, from its
early development in the Public Announcement Logic to the generalized
communication operations of action models, work on qualitative and
quantitative belief revision, and applications in a variety of areas.
Dynamic Epistemic Logic is an active and expanding area, and we have
highlighted a number of open problems and directions for further
research. </p>

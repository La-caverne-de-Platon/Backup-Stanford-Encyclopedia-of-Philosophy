<h1>Algebraic Propositional Logic</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Mon Dec 12, 2016; substantive revision Fri May 20, 2022</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
George Boole was the first to present logic as a mathematical theory
in algebraic style. In his work, and in that of the other algebraists
of the algebraic tradition of logic of the nineteenth century, the
distinction between a formal language and a mathematically rigorous
semantics for it was still not drawn. What the algebraists in this
tradition did was to build algebraic theories (of Boolean algebras,
and relation algebras) with among other interpretations a logical
one.</p>

<p>
The works of Frege and Russell introduced a different perspective on
the way to approach logic. In those works, a logic system was given by
a formal language and a deductive calculus, namely a set of axioms and
a set of inference rules. Let us (for this entry) call such a pair a
<em>logical deduction system</em>, and the formulas derivable in the
calculus its <em>theorems</em> (nowadays it is common practice in
algebraic logic to refer to this type of calculi as Hilbert-style and
in proof complexity theory as Frege systems). In Frege and
Russell&rsquo;s approach, a formal (mathematical) semantics of
whatever kind (algebraic, model-theoretic, etc.) for the formal
languages they used was lacking. The only semantics present was of an
intuitive, informal kind.</p>

<p>
The systems introduced by Frege and Russell were systems of classical
logic, but soon after systems of non-classical logics were considered
by other logicians. The first influential attempts to introduce logics
different from classical logic remained within the Frege-Russell
tradition of presenting a logical deduction system without any formal
semantics. These attempts lead to the first modal systems of C.I.
Lewis (1918, 1932) and to the axiomatization of intuitionistic logic
by Heyting (1930).</p>

<p>
The idea underlying the design of Frege and Russell&rsquo;s logical
deduction systems is that the theorems should be the formulas that
correspond (intuitively) to the logical truths or logical validities.
The concept of logical consequence was not central to the development,
and this was also the case in the many systems of non-classical logics
that were to be designed following in the footsteps of the first modal
systems of C.I. Lewis. This situation influenced the way in which the
research on some non-classical logics has usually been presented and
sometimes also its real evolution. However, the concept of logical
consequence has been the one that logic has traditionally dealt with.
Tarski put it once again into the center of modern logic, both
semantically and syntactically. Nowadays, a general theory of the
algebraization of logics around the concept of logical consequence has
grown from the different algebraic treatments of the different logics
obtained during the last century.</p>

<p>
The concept of logical consequence has proved much more fruitful than
those of theorem and of logical validity for the development of such a
general theory. The first attempts in the process of building the
general theory of the algebraization of logics can be found in the
study of the class of implicative logics by Rasiowa (1974) and in the
systematic presentation by W&oacute;jcicki (1988) of the
investigations of a general nature on propositional logics as
consequence operations carried out mainly by Polish logicians,
following the studies of Tarski, Lindenbaum, &#321;ukasiewicz and
others in the first part of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>
It was only in the 1920s that algebras and logical matrices (an
algebra together with a set of designated elements) started to be
taken as models of logical deduction systems, that is, as providing a
formal semantics for formal languages of logic. Moreover, they were
also used to define sets of formulas with similar properties to the
ones the sets of theorems of the known logical deduction systems have,
in particular the property of being closed under substitution
instances; soon after  logical matrices were also  used to
define logics as consequence relations.</p>

<p>
Algebraic logic can be described in very general terms as the
discipline that studies logics by associating with them classes of
algebras, classes of logical matrices and other algebra related
mathematical structures and that relates the properties that the
logics may have with properties of the associated algebras (or algebra
related structures) with the purpose that the understanding of these
algebras can be used to better understand the logic at hand.</p>

<p>
From the algebraic study of particular logics, a general theory of the
algebraization of logics slowly emerged during the last century with
the aim, more or less explicitly stated during the process, of
obtaining general and informative results relating the properties a
logic may have with the algebraic properties the class of algebras (or
algebra related structures) associated with it might enjoy. Those
algebraic studies assumed somehow an implicit conception of what is
the process by which to associate with any given logic a class of
algebras as its natural algebraic counterpart. The development of that
general theory speeded up and consolidated at the beginning of the
1980s with the introduction of the notion of algebraizable logic, and
at that time also the assumptions about the class of algebras that
deserves to be taken as the natural one to associate with a given logic
started to be made more and more explicit.</p>

<p>
In this entry we concentrate on the general theory of the
algebraization of propositional logics taken as consequence relations.
This theory has evolved into the field known as Abstract Algebraic
Logic (AAL). The entry can be taken as a mild introduction to this
field.</p>

<h2 id="AbstConsRela">1. Abstract consequence relations</h2>

<p>
Tarski&rsquo;s work (1930a, 1930b, 1935, 1936) on the methodology of
the deductive sciences of the 1920s and 1930s studies the axiomatic
method abstractly and introduces for the first time the abstract
concept of consequence operation. Tarski had mainly in mind the
different mathematical axiomatic theories. On these theories, the
sentences that are proved from the axioms are consequences of them but
(of course) almost all of them are not logical truths; under a
suitable formalization of these theories, a logical calculus like
Frege&rsquo;s or Russell&rsquo;s can be used to derive the
consequences of the axioms. Tarski set the framework to study the most
general properties of the operation that assigns to a set of axioms
its consequences.</p>

<p>
Given a logical deduction system \(H\) and an arbitrary
set of formulas \(X\), a formula \(a\)
is <em>deducible</em> in \(H\) from \(X\)
if there is a finite sequence of formulas any one of
which belongs to \(X\) or is an axiom of \(H\)
or is obtained from previous formulas in the sequence
by one of the inference rules of \(H\). Such a sequence
is a deduction (or proof) in \(H\) of \(a\)
with premises or hypotheses in \(X\).
Let \(Cn(X)\) be the set of formulas deducible in \(H\)
from the formulas in \(X\) taken as premises or
hypothesis. This set is called the set of consequences of \(X\)
(relative to the logical deduction system \(H\)).
\(Cn\) is then an operation that is applied to sets
of formulas to obtain new sets of formulas. It has the following
properties: For every set of formulas \(X\)</p>

<ol>

<li id="prop1">\(X \subseteq Cn(X)\)</li>

<li id="prop2">\(Cn(Cn(X)) = Cn(X)\)</li>

<li id="prop3">\(Cn(X) = \bigcup\{Cn(Y): Y \subseteq X, Y \textrm{
finite}\}\)</li>
</ol>

<p>
The third condition  stipulates that \(Cn(X)\) is equal to the union of the set of
formulas derivable from finite subsets of \(X\). Tarski
took these properties to define the notion of consequence operation
axiomatically. In fact, he added that there is a formula \(x\)
such that \(Cn(\{x\})\) is the set \(A\)
of all the formulas and that this set must be finite
or of the cardinality of the set of the natural numbers. Condition (3)
implies the weaker, and important, condition of monotonicity</p>

<ol start="4">

<li id="prop4">if \(X \subseteq Y \subseteq A\), then \(Cn(X)
\subseteq Cn(Y)\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
To encompass the whole class of logic systems one finds in the
literature, a slightly more general definition than Tarski&rsquo;s is
required. We will say that an <em>abstract consequence operation</em>
\(C\) on an arbitrary set \(A\) is an
operation that applied to subsets of \(A\) gives
subsets of \(A\) and for all \(X, Y \subseteq A\)
satisfies the conditions (1), (2) and (4) above. If in addition \(C\)
satisfies (3) we say that it is a <em>finitary
consequence operation</em>.</p>

<p>
Consequence operations are present not only in logic but in many areas
of mathematics. Abstract consequence operations are known as closure
operators in universal algebra and lattice theory, for instance. In
topology the operation that sends a subset of a topological space to
its topological closure is a closure operator. In fact, the topologies
on a set \(A\) can be identified with the closure
operators on \(A\) that satisfy the additional
conditions that \(C(\varnothing) = \varnothing\) and \(C(X \cup Y) =
C(X) \cup C(Y)\) for all \(X, Y \subseteq A\).</p>

<p>
Given a consequence operation \(C\) on a set \(A\),
a subset \(X\) of \(A\)
is said to be \(C\)-<em>closed</em>,
or a <em>closed</em> set of \(C\), if \(C(X) = X\).</p>

<p>
A different, but mathematically equivalent, (formal) approach is to
consider consequence relations on a set of formulas instead of
consequence operations. A(n) (abstract) <em>consequence relation</em>
on the set of formulas of a formal language is a relation \(\vdash\)
between sets of formulas and formulas that satisfies the following
conditions:</p>

<ol>

<li>if \(a \in X\), then \(X \vdash a\)</li>

<li>if \(X \vdash a\) and \(X \subseteq Y\), then \(Y \vdash a\)</li>

<li>if \(X \vdash a\) and for every \(b \in X, Y \vdash b\), then \(Y
\vdash a\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is <em>finitary</em> if in addition it satisfies</p>

<ol start="4">

<li>if \(X \vdash a\), then there is a finite set \(Y \subseteq X\)
such that \(Y \vdash a\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Given a logical deduction system \(H\), the relation
\(\vdash\) defined by \(X \vdash a\) if \(a\) is
deducible from \(X\) in \(H\) is (according to all we have already seen) a
finitary consequence relation. Nonetheless, we are used not only to
syntactic definitions of consequence relations but also to semantic
definitions. For example, we define classical propositional
consequence using truth valuations, first-order consequence relation
using structures, intuitionistic consequence relation using Kripke
models, etc. Sometimes these model-theoretic definitions of
consequence relations define non-finitary consequence relations, for
example, the consequence relations for infinitary formal languages and
the consequence relation of second-order logic with the so-called
standard semantics.</p>

<p>
In general, an <em>abstract consequence relation</em> on a set \(A\)
(not necessarily the set of formulas of some formal
language) is a relation \(\vdash\) between subsets of \(A\)
and elements of \(A\) that satisfies
conditions (1)&ndash;(3) above. If it also satisfies (4) it is said to
be finitary. If \(\vdash\) is an abstract consequence relation and \(X
\vdash a\), then we can say that \(X\) is a set of
premises or hypothesis with conclusion \(a\) according
to \(\vdash\) and that \(a\) follows from \(X\),
or is entailed by \(X\) (according to
\(\vdash)\). The abstract consequence relations correspond to
Koslow&rsquo;s implication structures; see Koslow 1992 for the closely
related but different approach to logics (in a broad sense) as
consequence relations introduced by that author.</p>

<p>
The consequence operations on a set \(A\) are in
one-to-one correspondence with the abstract consequence relations on
\(A\). The move from a consequence operation \(C\)
to a consequence relation \(\vdash_C\) and,
conversely, from a consequence relation \(\vdash\) to a consequence
operation \(C_{\vdash}\) is easy and given by the definitions:</p>

\[ X \vdash_C a \txtiff a \in C(X) \hspace{3mm} \textrm{ and } \hspace{3mm} a \in C_{\vdash}(X) \txtiff X \vdash a. \]

<p>
Moreover, if \(C\) is finitary, so is \(\vdash_C\) and
if \(\vdash\) is finitary, so is \(C_{\vdash}\).</p>

<p>
For a general discussion on logical consequence see the entry
 <a href="../logical-consequence/index.html">Logical Consequence</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="LogiConsRela">2. Logics as consequence relations</h2>

<p>
In this section we define what propositional logics are and explain
the basic concepts relating to them. We will call the propositional
logics (as defined below) simply <em>logic systems</em>.</p>

<p>
One of the main traits of the consequence relations we study in logic
is their formal character. This roughly means that if a sentence \(a\)
follows from a set of sentences \(X\)
and we have another sentence \(b\) and another set of
sentences \(Y\) that share the same form with \(a\)
and \(X\) respectively, then \(b\)
also follows from \(Y\). In
propositional logics this boils down to saying that if we uniformly
replace basic sub-sentences of the sentences in \(X \cup \{a\}\) by
other sentences obtaining \(Y\) and \(b\),
then \(b\) follows from \(Y\).
(The reader can find more information on the idea of
formality in the entry
 <a href="../logical-consequence/index.html">Logical Consequence</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
To turn the idea of the formal character of logics into a rigorous
definition we need to introduce the concept of propositional language
and the concept of substitution.</p>

<p>
A <em>propositional language</em> (a language, for short) \(L\) is a set of
connectives, that is, a set of symbols each one of which has an arity
\(n\) that tells us in case that \(n = 0\) that the
symbol is a propositional constant, and in case that \(n \gt 0\)
whether the connective is unary, binary, ternary, etc. For example
\(\{\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow , \bot , \top \}\) is (or can be) the
language of several logics, like classical and intuitionistic,
\((\bot\) and \(\top\) are 0-ary and the other connectives are
binary), \(\{\neg , \wedge , \vee \rightarrow , \Box , \Diamond \}\)
is the language of several modal logics, \((\neg , \Box , \Diamond\)
are unary and the other connectives binary) and \(\{ \wedge , \vee ,
\rightarrow , * , \top , \bot , 1, 0\}\) is the language of
many-valued logics and also of a fragment of linear logic \((\bot ,
\top , 1\), and 0 are propositional constants and the other symbols
binary connectives).</p>

<p>
Given a language \(L\) and a set of propositional
variables \(V\) (which is disjoint from \(L)\), the
<em>formulas</em> of \(L\), or \(L\)-<em>formulas</em>,
are defined inductively as
follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>Every variable is a formula.</li>

<li>Every 0-ary symbol is a formula.</li>

<li>If \(*\) is a connective and \(n \gt 0\) is its
arity, then for all formulas \(\phi_1 ,\ldots ,\phi_n, * \phi_1 \ldots
\phi_n\) is also a formula.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A <em>substitution</em> \(\sigma\) for \(L\) is a map
from the set of variables \(V\) to the set of formulas
of \(L\). It tells us which formula must replace which
variable when we perform the substitution. If \(p\) is
a variable, then \(\sigma(p)\) denotes the formula that the
substitution \(\sigma\) assigns to \(p\). The result of
applying a substitution \(\sigma\) to a formula \(\phi\) is the
formula \(\bsigma(\phi)\) obtained from \(\phi\) by simultaneously
replacing the variables in \(\phi\), say \(p_1 , \ldots ,p_k\), by,
respectively, the formulas \(\sigma(p_1), \ldots ,\sigma(p_k)\). In
this way, a substitution \(\sigma\) gives a unique map \(\bsigma\)
from the set of formulas to itself that satisfies</p>

<ol>

<li>\(\bsigma(p) = \sigma(p)\), for every variable \(p\),</li>

<li>\(\bsigma(\dagger) = \dagger\), for every 0-ary connective
\(\dagger\),</li>

<li>\(\bsigma(* \phi_1 \ldots \phi_n) = * \bsigma(\phi_1)\ldots
\bsigma(\phi_n)\), for every connective \(*\) of arity
\(n \gt 0\) and formulas \(\phi_1 , \ldots ,\phi_n\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
A formula \(\psi\) is a <em>substitution instance</em> of a formula
\(\phi\) if there is a substitution \(\sigma\) such that when applied
to \(\phi\) gives \(\psi\), that is, if \(\bsigma(\phi) = \psi\).</p>

<p>
In order to avoid unnecessary complications we will assume in the
sequel that all the logics use the same denumerable set \(V\) of
variables, so that the definition of formula of \(L\)
depends only on \(L\). A <em>logic system</em> (or
<em>logic</em> for short) is given by a language \(L\)
and a consequence relation \(\vdash\) on the set of formulas of \(L\)
that is <em>formal</em> in the sense that for every
substitution \(\sigma\), every set of formulas \(\Gamma\) and every
formula \(\phi\),</p> 

\[ \textrm{if } \Gamma \vdash \phi, \textrm{ then } \bsigma[\Gamma] \vdash\bsigma(\phi) \]

<p>
where \(\bsigma[\Gamma]\) is the set of the formulas obtained by
applying the substitution \(\sigma\) to the formulas in \(\Gamma\).
The consequence relations on the set of formulas of a language that
satisfy this property are called <em>structural</em> and also
<em>substitution-invariant</em> in the literature. They were
considered for the first time in &#321;o&#347; &amp; Suszko 1958.
Tarski only explicitly considered closed sets also closed under
substitution instances for some consequence relations; he never
considered (at least explicitly) the substitution invariance condition
for consequence relations.</p>

<p>
We will refer to logic systems by the letter \(\bL\) with possible
subindices, and we set \(\bL = \langle L, \vdash_{\bL } \rangle\) and
\(\bL_n = \langle L_n, \vdash_{\bL_n } \rangle\) with the
understanding that \(L \; (L_n)\) is the language of \(\bL \;(\bL_n)\)
and \(\vdash_{\bL }\; (\vdash_{\bL_n })\) its consequence relation. A
logic system \(\bL\) is <em>finitary</em> if \(\vdash_{\bL}\) is a
finitary consequence relation.</p>

<p>
The consequence relation of a logic system can be given in several
ways, some using proof-theoretic tools, others semantic means. A
substitution-invariant consequence relation can be defined using a
proof system like a Hilbert-style axiom system, a Gentzen-style
sequent calculus or a natural deduction style calculus, etc. One can
also define a substitution-invariant consequence relation semantically
using a class of mathematical objects (algebras, Kripke models,
topological models, etc.) and a satisfaction relation.</p>

<p>
If \(\bL_1 = \langle L,\vdash_{\bL_1 } \rangle\) is a logic system
with \(\vdash_{\bL_1}\) defined by a proof-system and \(\bL_2 =
\langle L, \vdash_{\bL_2 } \rangle\) is a logic system over the same
language with \(\vdash_{\bL_2}\) defined semantically, we say that the
proof-system used to define \(\vdash_{\bL_1}\) is <em>sound</em> for
the semantics used to define \(\vdash_{\bL_2}\) if \(\vdash_{\bL_1}\)
is included in \(\vdash_{\bL_2}\), namely if \(\Gamma \vdash_{\bL_1 }
\phi\) implies \(\Gamma \vdash_{\bL_2 } \phi\). If the other inclusion
holds the proof-system is said to be <em>complete</em> with respect to
the semantics that defines \(\vdash_{\bL_2}\), that is, when \(\Gamma
\vdash_{\bL_2 } \phi\) implies \(\Gamma \vdash_{\bL_1 } \phi\).</p>

<p>
A set of \(L\)-formulas \(\Gamma\) is called a
<em>theory</em> of a logic system \(\bL\), or \(\bL\)-theory, if it is
closed under the relation \(\vdash_{\bL}\), that is, if whenever
\(\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi\) it also holds that \(\phi \in \Gamma\).
In other words, the theories of \(\bL\) are the closed sets of the
consequence operation \(C_{\vdash_{ \bL}}\) on the set of \(L\)-formulas.
In order to simplify the notation we denote
this consequence operation by \(C_{\bL}\). A formula \(\phi\) is a
<em>theorem</em> (or validity) of \(\bL\) if \(\varnothing \vdash_{\bL
} \phi\). Then \(C_{\bL }(\varnothing)\) is the set of theorems of
\(\bL\) and is the least theory of \(\bL\). The set of all theories of
\(\bL\) will be denoted by \(\tTH(\bL)\).</p> 

<p>Given a logic system \(\bL\), the consequence operation \(C_{\bL}\) is substitution-invariant, which means that for every set of \(L\)-formulas \(\Gamma\) and every substitution \(\sigma, \bsigma[C_{\bL}(\Gamma)] \subseteq C_{\bL}(\bsigma[\Gamma]\)). Moreover, for every theory \(T\) of \(\bL\) we have a new consequence \(C_{\bL }^T\) operation defined as follows: \[C_{\bL }^T (\Gamma) = C_{\bL }(T \cup \Gamma)\] that is, \(C_{\bL }^T (\Gamma)\) is the set of formulas that follow from \(\Gamma\) and \(T\) according to \(\bL\). It turns out that \(T\) is closed under substitutions if and only if \(C_{\bL }^T\) is substitution-invariant.</p>

<p>
If \(\bL\) is a logic system and \(\Gamma , \Delta\) are sets of \(L\)-formulas,
we will use the notation \(\Gamma
\vdash_{\bL } \Delta\) to state that for every \(\psi \in \Delta ,
\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \psi\). Thus \(\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \Delta\) if
and only if \(\Delta \subseteq C_{\bL }(\Gamma)\).</p> 

<p>If \(\bL = \langle L, \vdash_{\bL } \rangle\) and \(\bL' = \langle L', \vdash_{\bL' } \rangle\) are logic systems whose languages satisfy that  \(L'\subseteq L\) (hence all the \(L'\)-formulas are \(L\)-formulas) and   \[\Gamma \vdash_{\bL' } \phi \txtiff \Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi,\] for every set of \(L'\)-formulas \(\Gamma\) and every \(L'\)-formula \(\phi\) we say that \(\bL'\) is a <em>fragment</em> \(\bL\) (in fact, the \(\bL'\)-fragment) and   that \(\bL\) is an <em>expansion</em> of \(\bL'\).</p>

<p>
We use the standard convention of writing \((\phi * \psi)\) instead of

parenthesis in the formulas.</p>

<h3 id="ClasPropLogi">3.1 Classical propositional logic</h3>

<p>
We take the language of Classical propositional logic \(\bCPL\) to be
the set \(L_c = \{\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow , \top , \bot \},\)
where \(\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow\) are binary connectives and
\(\top , \bot\) propositional constants. We assume that the
consequence relation is defined by the usual truth-table method
\((\top\) is interpreted as <span class="monospace">true</span> and
\(\bot\) as <span class="monospace">false</span>) as follows,</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\Gamma \vdash_{\bCPL } \phi\txtiff\) every truth valuation that

<p>
The formulas \(\phi\) such that \(\varnothing \vdash_{\bCPL } \phi\)
are the <em>tautologies</em>. Note that using the language \(L_c\),
the negation of a formula \(\phi\) is defined as \(\phi \rightarrow

<h3 id="LocaNormModaLogi">3.3 Local Normal Modal logics</h3> 

<p>The language of modal logic we consider here is the set \(L_m = \{\wedge , \vee , \rightarrow , \neg , \Box , \top , \bot \}\) that expands \(L_c\) by adding the unary connective \(\Box\). In the standard literature on modal logic a normal modal logic is defined not as a consequence relation but as a set of formulas with certain properties. A <em>normal modal logic</em> is a set \(\Lambda\) of formulas of \(L_m\) that contains all the tautologies of the language of classical logic, the formulas of the form \[\Box(\phi \rightarrow \psi) \rightarrow(\Box \phi \rightarrow \Box \psi)\] and is closed under the rules</p>

 

\[ \begin{align*} \phi , \phi \rightarrow \psi / \psi \tag{Modus Ponens}\\ \phi / \Box \phi \tag{Modal Generalization}\\ \phi/ \bsigma(\phi), \textrm{ for every substitution } \sigma \tag{Substitution}\\ \end{align*} \]

<p>
Note that the set \(\Lambda\) is closed under substitution instances,
namely for every substitution \(\sigma\), if \(\phi \in L_m\), then
\(\bsigma(\phi) \in L_m\).</p>

<p>
The least normal modal logic is called \(K\) and can be
axiomatized by the Hilbert-style calculus with axioms the tautologies
of classical logic and the formulas \(\Box(\phi \rightarrow \psi)
\rightarrow(\Box \phi \rightarrow \Box \psi)\), and with rules of
inference Modus Ponens and Modal Generalization. Note that since we use schemas in the presentation of the axioms, the set of derivable formulas is closed under the Substitution  rule.</p>

<p>
With a normal modal logic \(\Lambda\) it is associated the consequence
relation defined by the calculus that takes as axioms all the formulas
in \(\Lambda\) and as the only rule of inference Modus Ponens. The
logic system given by this consequence relation is called the
<em>local consequence</em> of \(\Lambda\). We denote it by
\(\blLambda\). Its theorems are the elements of \(\Lambda\) and it
holds that</p>

<p class="indent">
\(\Gamma \vdash_{\blLambda} \phi\txtiff\phi \in \Lambda\) or there are
\(\phi_1 , \ldots ,\phi_n \in \Gamma\) such that \((\phi_1 \wedge
\ldots \wedge \phi_n) \rightarrow \phi \in \Lambda\).</p>

<h3 id="GlobNormModaLogi">3.4 Global Normal Modal logics</h3>

<p>
Another consequence relation is associated naturally with each normal modal
logic \(\Lambda\), defined by the calculus that has as axioms
the formulas of \(\Lambda\) and as rules of inference Modus Ponens and
Modal Generalization. The logic system given by this consequence
relation is called the <em>global consequence</em> of \(\Lambda\) and
will be denoted by \(\bgLambda\). It has the same theorems as the
local \(\blLambda\), namely the elements of \(\Lambda\). The
difference between \(\blLambda\) and \(\bgLambda\) lies in the
consequences they allow to draw from nonempty sets of premises. For example we have 
\(p \vdash_{\bgK} \Box p\)  but \(p \not\vdash_{\blK} \Box p\).  This
difference has an enormous effect on their algebraic behavior.</p>

<h2 id="Alge">4. Algebras</h2>

<p>
The algebraic study of a particular logic has to provide first of all
its formal language with an algebraic semantics using a class of
algebras whose properties are exploited to understand which properties
the logic has. In this section, we present how the formal languages of
propositional logics are given an algebraic interpretation. In the
next section, we address the question of what is an algebraic
semantics for a logic system.</p>

<p>
We start by describing the first two steps involved in the algebraic
study of propositional logics. Both are needed in order to endow
propositional languages with algebraic interpretations. To expound
them we will assume knowledge of first-order logic (see the entries on
 <a href="../logic-classical/index.html">classical logic</a>
 and
 <a href="../modeltheory-fo/index.html">first-order model theory</a>)
 and we will call <em>algebraic first-order languages</em>, or simply
<em>algebraic languages</em>, the first-order languages with equality
and without any relational symbols, so that these languages have only
operation symbols (also called function symbols), if any, in the set
of their non-logical symbols.</p>

<p>
The two steps we are about to expound can be summarized in the
slogan:</p>

<p class="indent">
Propositional formulas are terms.</p>

<p>
The <em>first step</em> consist in looking at the formulas of any
propositional language \(L\) as the terms of the
algebraic first-order language with \(L\) as its set of
operation symbols. This means that (i) every connective of \(L\)
of arity \(n\) is taken as an
operation symbol of arity \(n\) (thus every 0-ary
symbol of \(L\) is taken as an individual constant) and
that (ii) the propositional formulas of \(L\) are taken
as the terms of this first-order language; in particular the
propositional variables are the variables of the first-order language.
From this point of view the definition of \(L\)-formula
is exactly the definition of \(L\)-term. We will refer
to the algebraic language with \(L\) as its set of
operation symbols as the \(L\)-<em>algebraic
language</em>.</p>

<p>
The <em>second step</em> is to interpret the propositional formulas in
the same manner in which terms of a first-order language are
interpreted in a structure. In this way the concept of \(L\)-algebra
comes into play. On a given set \(A\),
an \(n\)-ary connective is
interpreted by an \(n\)-ary function on \(A\)
(a map that assigns an element of \(A\)
to every sequence \(\langle a_1 , \ldots
,a_n\rangle\) of elements of \(A)\). This procedure is a
generalization of the truth-table interpretations of the languages of
logic systems like classical logic and &#321;ukasiewicz and
Post&rsquo;s finite-valued logics. In those cases, given the set of
truth-values at play the function that interprets a connective is
given by its truth-table.</p>

<p>
A way to introduce algebras is as the models of some algebraic
first-order language. We follow an equivalent route and give the
definition of algebra using the setting of propositional languages.
Let \(L\) be a propositional language. An
<em>algebra</em> \(\bA\) of type \(L\), or \(L\)-algebra
for short, is a set \(A\),
called the carrier or the universe of \(\bA\), together with a
function \(* ^{\bA}\) on \(A\) of the arity of \(*\),
for every connective \(*\) in \(L\) (if \(*\) is 0-ary,
\(* ^{\bA}\) is an element of \(A)\). An algebra \(\bA\) is
<em>trivial</em> if its carrier is a one element set.</p>

<p>
A <em>valuation</em> on an \(L\)-algebra \(\bA\) is a
map \(v\) from the set of variables into its carrier
\(A\). Algebras together with valuations are used to
interpret in a compositional way the formulas of \(L\),
assuming that a connective \(*\) of \(L\) is
interpreted in an \(L\)-algebra \(\bA\) by the function
\(* ^{\bA}\). Let \(\bA\) be an algebra of type \(L\)
and \(v\) a valuation on \(\bA\). The value of a
compound formula \(* \phi_1 \ldots \phi_n\) is computed by applying
the function \(* ^{\bA}\) that interprets \(*\) in \(\bA\) to the
previously computed values \(\bv(\phi_1), \ldots,\bv(\phi_n)\) of the
formulas \(\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_n\). Precisely speaking, the value
\(\bv(\phi)\) of a formula \(\phi\) is defined inductively as
follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>\(\bv(p) = v(p)\), for each variable \(p\),</li>

<li>\(\bv(\dagger) = \dagger^{\bA}\), if \(\dagger\) is a 0-ary
connective</li>

<li>\(\bv(* \phi_1 \ldots \phi_n) = * ^{\bA }(\bv(\phi_1), \ldots
,\bv(\phi_n))\), if \(*\) is a \(n\)-ary \((n \gt 0)\)
connective.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that in this way we have obtained a map \(\bv\) from the set of
\(L\)-formulas to the carrier of \(\bA\). It is
important to notice that the value of a formula under a valuation
depends only on the propositional variables that actually appear in
the formula. Accordingly, if \(\phi\) is a formula, then we use the
notation \(\phi(p_1 , \ldots ,p_n)\) to indicate that the variables
that appear in \(\phi\) are in the list \(p_1 , \ldots ,p_n\), and
given elements \(a_1 , \ldots ,a_n\) of an algebra \(\bA\) we refer by
\(\phi^{\bA }[a_1 , \ldots ,a_n]\) to the value of \(\phi(p_1 , \ldots
,p_n)\) under any valuation \(v\) on \(\bA\) such that
\(v(p_1) = a_1 , \ldots ,v(p_n) = a_n\).</p>

<p>
A <em>third</em> and fundamental <em>step</em> in the algebraic study
of logics is to turn the set of formulas of a language \(L\)
into an algebra, the <em>algebra of formulas</em> of
\(L\), denoted by \(\bFm_L\). This algebra has the set
of \(L\)-formulas as carrier and the operations are
defined as follows. For every \(n\)-ary connective \(*\)
with \(n \gt 0\), the function \(* ^{\bFm_L}\) is the
map that sends each tuple of formulas \((\phi_1 , \ldots ,\phi_n)\)
(where \(n\) is the arity of \(*\)) to the formula \(*
\phi_1 \ldots \phi_n\), and for every 0-ary connective \(\dagger ,
\dagger^{\bFm_L}\) is \(\dagger\). If no confusion is likely we
suppress the subindex in \(\bFm_L\) and write \(\bFm\) instead.</p>

<h3 id="SomeConcUnivAlgeModeTheo">4.1 Some concepts of universal algebra and model theory</h3>

<p>
Algebras are a particular type of structure or model. An \(L\)-algebra
is a structure or model for the \(L\)-algebraic
first-order language. Therefore the
concepts of model theory for the first-order languages apply to them
(see the entries on
 <a href="../logic-classical/index.html">classical logic</a>
 and
 <a href="../modeltheory-fo/index.html">first-order model theory</a>).
 We need some of these concepts. They are also used in universal
algebra, a field that to some extent can be considered the model
theory of the algebraic languages. We introduce the definitions of the
concepts we need.</p>

<p>
Given an algebra \(\bA\) of type \(L\), a
<em>congruence</em> of \(\bA\) is an equivalence relation \(\theta\)
on the carrier of \(\bA\) that satisfies for every \(n\)-ary
connective \(* \in L\) the following
compatibility property: for every \(a_1 , \ldots ,a_n, b_1 , \ldots
,b_n \in A\),</p> 

\[ \textrm{if } a_1\theta b_1 , \ldots ,a_n \theta b_1, \textrm{ then } *^{\bA}(a_1 ,\ldots ,a_n)\ \theta *^{\bA}(b_1 ,\ldots ,b_n). \]

<p>
Given a congruence \(\theta\) of \(\bA\) we can reduce the algebra by
identifying the elements which are related by \(\theta\). The algebra
obtained is the <em>quotient algebra</em> of \(\bA\) modulo
\(\theta\). It is denoted by \(\bA/\theta\), its carrier is the set
\(A/\theta\) of equivalence classes \([a]\) of the elements \(a\)
of \(A\) modulo the equivalence
relation \(\theta\), and the operations are defined as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>\(\dagger^{\bA/\theta} = [\dagger^{\bA}]\), for every 0-ary
connective \(\dagger\),</li>

<li>\(* ^{\bA/\theta}([a_1], \ldots, [a_n]) = [* ^{\bA }(a_1 ,\ldots
,a_n)]\), for every connective \(*\) whose arity is \(n\)
and \(n \gt 0\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The compatibility property ensures that the definition is sound.</p>

<p>
Let \(\bA\) and \(\bB\) be \(L\)-algebras. A
<em>homomorphism</em> \(h\) from \(\bA\) to \(\bB\) is
a map \(h\) from \(A\) to \(B\)
such that for every 0-ary symbol \(\dagger \in L\)
and every \(n\)-ary connective \(* \in L\)</p>

<ol>

<li>\(h(\dagger^{\bA }) = \dagger^{\bB}\)</li>

<li>\(h(* ^{\bA }(a_1 ,\ldots ,a_n)) = * ^{\bB }(h(b_1),\ldots
,h(b_n))\), for all \(a_1 , \ldots ,a_n \in A\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
We say that \(\bB\) is a <em>homomorphic image</em> of \(\bA\) if
there is a homomorphism from \(\bA\) to \(\bB\) which is an onto map
from \(A\) to \(B\). An homomorphism
from \(\bA\) to \(\bB\) is an <em>isomorphism</em> if it is a
one-to-one and onto map from \(A\) to \(B\).
If an isomorphism from \(\bA\) to \(\bB\) exists, we
say that \(\bA\) and \(\bB\) are <em>isomorphic</em> and that \(\bB\)
is an <em>isomorphic image</em> (or a copy) of \(\bA\).</p>

<p>
Let \(\bA\) and \(\bB\) be \(L\)-algebras. \(\bA\) is a
<em>subalgebra</em> of \(\bB\) if (1) \(A \subseteq B\), (2) the
interpretations of the 0-ary symbols of \(L\) in
\(\bB\) belong to \(A\) and \(A\) is
closed under the functions of \(\bB\) that interpret the non 0-ary
symbols, and (3) the interpretations of the 0-ary symbols in \(\bA\)
coincide with their interpretations in \(\bB\) and the interpretations
on \(\bA\) of the other symbols in \(L\) are the
restrictions to \(\bA\) of their interpretations in \(\bB\).</p>

<h3 id="VariQuas">4.2 Varieties and quasivarieties</h3>

<p>
The majority of classes of algebras that provide semantics for
propositional logics are quasivarieties and in most cases varieties.
The theory of varieties and quasivarieties is one of the main subjects
of universal algebra.</p>

<p>
An equational class of \(L\)-algebras is a class of \(L\)-algebras
that is definable in a very simple way (by
equations) using the \(L\)-algebraic language. An \(L\)-<em>equation</em>
is a formula \(\phi \approx \psi\)
where \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) are terms of the \(L\)-algebraic
language (that is, \(L\)-formulas
if we take the propositional logic's point of
view) and '\(\approx\)' is the formal symbol for the equality (always to be interpreted as the identity relation). An equation \(\phi \approx \psi\) is <em>valid</em> in an
algebra \(\bA\), or \(\bA\) is a <em>model</em> of \(\phi \approx
\psi\), if for every valuation \(v\) on \(\bA,
\bv(\phi) = \bv(\psi)\). This is exactly the same as to saying that
the universal closure of \(\phi \approx \psi\) is a sentence true in
\(\bA\) according to the usual semantics for first-order logic with
equality. An <em>equational class</em> of \(L\)-algebras is a
class of \(L\)-algebras which is the class of all the
models of a given set of \(L\)-equations.</p>

<p>A quasi-equational class of \(L\)-algebras is a class of \(L\)-algebras definable using the \(L\)-algebraic language in a slightly more complex way than in equational.classes. A <em>proper \(L\)-quasiequation</em> is a formula of the form \[\bigwedge_{i \le n} \phi_i \approx \psi_i \rightarrow \phi \approx \psi.\] An \(L\)-<em>quasiequation</em> is a formula of the above form but possibly with an empty antecedent, in which case it is just the equation \(\phi \approx \psi\). Hence, the \(L\)-quasiequations are the proper \(L\)-quasiequations and the \(L\)-equations. An \(L\)-quasiequation is <em>valid</em> in an \(L\)-algebra \(\bA\), or the algebra is a model of it, if the universal closure of the quasiequation is sentence true in \(\bA\). A <em>quasi-equational class</em> of \(L\)-algebras is a class of algebras that is the class of the models of a given set of \(L\)-quasiequations. Since equations are quasiequations, every equational class  is quasi-equational. The converse is false. Moreover, since in the trivial algebras all the equations and all the quasiequations of the appropriate algebraic language are valid, equational and  quasi-equational classes are nonempty. </p>

<p>
Equational and quasi-equational classes of algebras  can be characterized by the closure
properties they enjoy. A nonempty class of \(L\)-algebras
is a <em>variety</em> if  it is closed
under subalgebras, direct products, and homomorphic images. It is   a <em>quasivariety</em>  
if it is closed under subalgebras, direct products, ultraproducts,
isomorphic images, and contains a trivial algebra. It is easily seen that equational classes are varieties and that quasi-equational classes are quasiviarities. Birkhoff's theorem states that all varieties are equational classes and Malcev's theorem that all quasivarieties are quasi-equational classes. </p>

<p>
 The
variety generated by a nonempty class \(\bK\) of \(L\)-algebras
is the least class of \(L\)-algebras
that includes \(\bK\) and is closed under
subalgebras, direct products and homomorphic images. It is also the
class of the algebras that are models of the equations valid in
\(\bK\). For example, the variety generated by the algebra of the two
truth-values for classical logic is the class of Boolean algebras. If
we restrict that algebra to the operations for conjunction and
disjunction only, it generates the variety of distributive lattices
and if we restrict it to the operations for conjunction and
disjunction and the interpretations of \(\top\) and \(\bot\), it
generates the variety of bounded distributive lattices.</p>



<p> The quasivariety
generated by a class \(\bK\) of \(L\)-algebras is the
least class of \(L\)-algebras that includes \(\bK\),
the trivial algebras and is closed under subalgebras, direct products,
ultraproducts, and isomorphic images.</p>

<p>
An SP-<em>class</em> of \(L\)-algebras is a class of
\(L\)-algebras that contains a trivial algebra and is
closed under isomorphic images, subalgebras, and direct products. Thus
quasivarieties and varieties are all SP-classes. The SP-class
generated by a class \(\bK\) of \(L\)-algebras is the
least class of \(L\)-algebras that includes \(\bK\),
the trivial algebras and is closed under subalgebras, direct products
and isomorphic images.</p>

<h2 id="AlgeSema">5. Algebraic semantics</h2>

<p>
The term &lsquo;algebraic semantics&rsquo; was (and many times still
is) used in the literature in a loose way. To provide a logic with an
algebraic semantics was to interpret its language in a class of
algebras, define a notion of satisfaction of a formula (under a
valuation) in an algebra of the class and prove a soundness and
completeness theorem, usually for the theorems of the logic only.
Nowadays there is a precise concept of algebraic semantics for a logic
system. It was introduced by Blok and Pigozzi in Blok &amp; Pigozzi
1989. In this concept we find a general way to state in mathematically
precise terms what is common to the many cases of purported algebraic
semantics for specific logic systems found in the literature. We
expose the notion in this section. To motivate the definition we
discuss several examples first, stressing the relevant properties that
they share. The reader does not need to know about the classes of
algebras that provide algebraic semantics we refer to in the examples.
Its existence is what is important.</p>

<p>
The prototypical examples of algebraic semantics for propositional
logics are the class <strong>BA</strong> of
 <a href="../boolalg-math/index.html">Boolean algebras</a>,
 which is the algebraic semantics for classical logic, and the class
<strong>HA</strong> of Heyting algebras, which is the algebraic
semantics for
 <a href="../logic-intuitionistic/index.html">intuitionistic logic</a>.
 Every Boolean algebra and every Heyting algebra \(\bA\) has a
greatest element according to their natural order; this element is
denoted usually by \(1^{\bA}\) and interprets the propositional
constant symbol \(\top\). It is taken as the distinguished element
relative to which the algebraic semantics is given. The algebraic
semantics of these two logics works as follows:</p>

<p>
Let \(\bL\) be classical or intuitionistic logic and let \(\bK(\bL)\)
be the corresponding class of algebras <strong>BA</strong> or
<strong>HA</strong>. It holds that</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi \txtiff\) for every \(\bA \in \bK(\bL)\)
and every valuation \(v\) on \(\bA\), if \(\bv(\psi) =
1^{\bA}\) for all \(\psi \in \Gamma \), then \(\bv(\phi) =
1^{\bA}\).</p>
</div>

<p>
This is the precise content of the statement that <strong>BA</strong>
and <strong>HA</strong> are an algebraic semantics for classical logic
and for intuitionistic logic, respectively. The implication from left
to right in the expression above is an algebraic soundness theorem and
the implication from right to left an algebraic completeness
theorem.</p>

<p>
There are logics for which an algebraic semantics is provided in the
literature in a slightly different way from the one given by the
schema above. Let us consider the example in
 <a href="#IntuLineLogiWithExpo">Section 3.5</a>
 of Intuitionistic Linear Logic without exponentials. We denote by
\(\bILsubZ\) the class of IL-algebras with zero defined in Troelstra
1992 (but adapted to the language of \(\bILL)\). Each \(\bA \in
\bILsubZ\) is a lattice with extra operations and thus has its lattice
order \(\le^{\bA}\). This lattice order has a greatest element which
we take as the interpretation of \(\top\). On each one of these
algebras \(\bA\) there is a designated element \(1^{\bA}\) (the
interpretation of the constant 1) that may be different from the
greatest element. It holds:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\Gamma \vdash_{\bILL } \phi \txtiff\) for every \(\bA \in \bILsubZ\)
and every valuation \(v\) on \(\bA\), if \(1^{\bA }
\le^{\bA } \bv(\psi)\) for all \(\psi \in \Gamma \), then \(1^{\bA }
\le^{\bA } \bv(\phi)\).</p>
</div>

<p>
In this case one does not consider only a designated element in every
algebra \(\bA\) but a set of designated elements, namely the elements
of \(\bA\) greater than or equal to \(1^{\bA}\),  to provide the
definition. Let us denote this set by \(\tD (\bA)\), and notice that
\(\tD (\bA) = \{a \in A: 1^{\bA } \wedge^{\bA} a = 1^{\bA }\}\).
Hence,</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\Gamma \vdash_{\bILL } \phi \txtiff\) for every \(\bA \in \bILsubZ\)
if \(\bv[\Gamma] \subseteq \tD (\bA)\), then \(\bv(\phi) \in \tD
(\bA)\).</p>
</div> 

<p>Still there are even more complex situations. One of them is the system \(\bR\) of relevance logic. Consider the class of algebras \(\bRal\) defined in Font &amp; Rodr&iacute;guez 1990 (see also Font &amp; Rodr&iacute;guez 1994) and denoted there by &lsquo;\(\bR\)&rsquo;. Let us consider for every \(\bA \in \bRal\) the set \[\tE(\bA) := \{a \in A: a \wedge^{\bA }(a \rightarrow^{\bA } a) = a \rightarrow^{\bA } a\}.\] Then \(\bRal\) is said to be an algebraic semantics for \(\bR\) because the following holds:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\Gamma \vdash_{\bR } \phi\txtiff\) for every \(\bA \in \bRal\) and
every valuation \(v\) on \(\bA\), if \(\bv[\Gamma]
\subseteq \tE (\bA)\), then \(\bv(\phi) \in \tE (\bA)\).</p>
</div>

<p>
The common pattern in the examples above is that the algebraic
semantics is given by</p>

<ol>

<li>a class of algebras \(\bK\),</li>

<li>in each algebra in \(\bK\) a set of designated elements that plays
the role \(1^{\bA}\) (more precisely the set \(\{1^{\bA }\})\) plays
in the cases of classical and intuitionistic logic, and</li>

<li>this set of designated elements is definable (in the same manner
on every algebra) by an equation in the sense that it is the set of
elements of the algebra that satisfy the equation (i.e., its
solutions). For <strong>BA</strong> and <strong>HA</strong> the
equation is \(p \approx \top\). For \(\bRal\) it is \(p \rightarrow(p
\wedge p) \approx p \rightarrow p\), and for \(\bILsubZ\) it is \(1
\wedge p \approx 1\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The main point in Blok and Pigozzi&rsquo;s concept of algebraic
semantics comes from the realization, mentioned in (3) above, that the
set of designated elements considered in the algebraic semantics of
known logics is in fact the set of solutions of an equation, and that
what practice forced researchers to look for when they tried to obtain
algebraic semantics for new logics was in fact, although not
explicitly formulated in these terms, an equational way to define
uniformly in every algebra a set of designated elements in order to
obtain an algebraic soundness and completeness theorem.</p>

<p>
We are now in a position to expose the mathematically precise concept
of algebraic semantics. To develop a fruitful and general theory of
the algebraization of logics some generalizations beyond the
well-known concrete examples have to be made. In the definition of
algebraic semantics, one takes the move from a single equation to a
set of them in the definability condition for the set of designated
elements.</p>

<p>
Before stating Blok and Pigozzi&rsquo;s definition we need to
introduce a notational convention. Given an algebra \(\bA\) and a set
of equations \(\iEq\) in one variable, we denote by \(\tEq(\bA)\) the
set of elements of \(\bA\) that satisfy all the equations in \(\iEq\).
Then a logic \(\bL\) is said to have an <em>algebraic semantics</em>
if there is a class of algebras \(\bK\) and a set of equations
\(\iEq\) in one variable such that</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">

<dt>(**)</dt>
<dd> \( \Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi \txtiff\) for every \(\bA \in \bK\)
and every valuation \(v\) on \(\bA\), if \(\bv[\Gamma] \subseteq
\iEq(\bA)\), then \(\bv(\phi) \in \tEq(\bA)\). </dd>
</dl>

<p>
In this situation we say that the class of algebras \(\bK\) is an
\(\iEq\)-<em>algebraic semantics</em> for \(\bL\), or that the pair
\((\bK, \iEq)\) is an <em>algebraic semantics</em> for \(\bL\). If
\(\iEq\) consists of a single equation \(\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p)\) we will simply say that \(\bK\) is a \(\delta(p)
\approx \varepsilon(p)\)-algebraic semantics for \(\bL\). In fact,
Blok and Pigozzi required that \(\iEq\) should be finite in their
definition of algebraic semantics. But it is better to be more
general. The definition clearly encompasses the situations encountered
in the examples.</p>

<p>
If \(\bK\) is an \(\iEq\)-algebraic semantics for a finitary logic
\(\bL\) and \(\iEq\) is finite, then the quasivariety generated by
\(\bK\) is also an \(\iEq\)-algebraic semantics. The same does not
hold in general if we consider the generated variety. For this reason,
it is customary and useful when developing the theory of the
algebraization of finitary logics to consider quasivarieties of
algebras as algebraic semantics instead of arbitrary subclasses that
generate them. Conversely, if a quasivariety is an \(\iEq\)-algebraic
semantics for a finitary \(\bL\) and \(\iEq\) is finite, then so is
any subclass of the quasivariety that generates it.</p>

<p>
In the best-behaved cases, the typical algebraic semantics of a logic
is a variety, for instance in all the examples discussed above. But
there are cases in which it is not (see Blok &amp; Pigozzi 1989).</p>

<p>
A quasivariety can be an \(\iEq\)-algebraic semantics for a logic and
an \(\iEq'\)-algebraic semantics for another logic (with \(\iEq\) and
\(\iEq'\) different). For example, due to Glivenko&rsquo;s theorem
(see the entry on
 <a href="../logic-intuitionistic/index.html">intuitionistic logic</a>)
 the class of Heyting algebras is a \(\{\neg \neg p \approx
1\}\)-algebraic semantics for classical logic and it is the standard
\(\{p \approx 1\}\)-algebraic semantics for intuitionistic logic.
Moreover, different quasivarieties of algebras can be an
\(\iEq\)-algebraic semantics for the same logic. It is known that
there is a quasivariety that properly includes the variety of Boolean
algebras that  is also a \(\{p \approx 1\}\)-algebraic semantics for
classical propositional logic. It is also known that for some logics
with an algebraic semantics (relative to some set of equations), the
natural class of algebras that corresponds to the logic is not an
algebraic semantics (for any set of equations) of it. One example
where this situation holds is in the local normal modal logic
\(\blK\). Finally, there are logics that do not have any algebraic
semantics.</p>

<p>
These facts highlight the need for some criteria of the goodness of a
pair \((\bK, \iEq)\) to provide a natural algebraic semantics for a
logic \(\bL\) when some exists. One such criterion would be that
\(\bL\) is an algebraizable logic with \((\bK, \iEq)\) as an algebraic
semantics. Another that \(\bK\) is the natural class of algebras
associated with the logic \(\bL\). The notion of the natural class of
algebras of a logic system will be discussed in
 <a href="#NatuClasAlgeLogiSyst">Section 8</a>
 and the concept of algebraizable logic in
 <a href="#WhenLogiAlgeWhatDoesMean">Section 9</a>.</p>
 

<p>
The interested reader can examine Blok &amp; Rebagliato 2003 for a
study devoted to algebraic semantics of logics and Moraschini
forthcoming for the most recent results on the topic (in this paper
there is a proof of the fact that the natural class of algebras of the
local normal modal logic \(\blK\), namely the class of modal algebras,
is not an algebraic semantics (for any set of equations) for it).</p>

<p>
There is a particular, and important, kind of logics with an algebraic
semantics that includes classical and intuitionistic logics. It is the
class of the so-called assertional logics. </p>

<p>
Let \(\bK\) be a class of algebras in an algebraic language with a
constant term for \(\bK\), i.e., a formula \(\phi(p_1 , \ldots ,p_n)\)
such that for every algebra \(\bA\in \bK\) and elements \(a_1 , \ldots
,a_n, b_1, \ldots, b_n\) of \(\bA\), \(\phi^{\bA }[a_1 , \ldots ,a_n] =
\phi^{\bA }[b_1 , \ldots ,b_n]\), that is, in every algebra in
\(\bK\), \(\phi\) takes the same value whatever is the way we
interpret the variable in \(\phi\) on \(\bA\). We denote this value by
\(\phi^{\bA}\). Thus \(\phi\) acts as a constant (relative to the
algebras in \(\bK\)) and \(\phi^{\bA}\) (for \(\bA\in \bK\)) can be
taken as a designated element.</p>

<p>
Given a class of algebras \(\bK\) in an algebraic language with a
constant term \(\phi\) for \(\bK\), the <em>assertional logic</em>
\(\bL_{\bK}^{\phi}\) <em>of</em> (\(\bK, \phi\)) is defined by</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\Gamma \vdash_{\bL_{\bK}^{\phi} } \phi \txtiff\) for every \(\bA \in
\bK(\bL)\) and every valuation v on \(\bA\), if \(\bv(\psi) =
\phi^{\bA}\) for all \(\psi \in \Gamma \), then \(\bv(\phi) =
\phi^{\bA}\).</p>
</div>

<p>
A logic system \(\bL\) is <em>assertional</em> when there exists a
class of algebras \(\bK\) in the algebraic language of \(\bL\) and a
constant term \(\phi\) for \(\bK\) such that \(\bL\) =
\(\bL_{\bK}^{\phi}\).</p>

<p>
The most recent study of assertional logics is Albuquerque et al. 2018.
We address the reader to this paper where the classification of the
assertional logics in the Leibniz and Frege hierarchies of logic
systems that we present in later sections is addressed and several
examples are discussed.</p>

<h2 id="LogiMatr">6. Logical matrices</h2>

<p>
In the last section, we saw that to provide a logic with an algebraic
semantics we need in many cases to consider in every algebra a set of
designated elements instead of a single designated one. In the
examples we discussed, the set of designated elements was definable in
the algebras by one equation. This motivated the definition of
algebraic semantics in
 <a href="#AlgeSema">Section 5</a>.
 For many logics, to obtain a semantics similar to an algebraic
semantics using the class of algebras naturally associated with them
one needs for every algebra a set of designated elements that cannot
be defined using only the equations of the algebraic language or is
not even definable by using this language only. As we already
mentioned, one example where this happens is the local consequence of
the normal modal logic \(K\). Also, recall that there are logics with no algebraic semantics at all.</p>

<p>
To endow <em>every</em> logic with a semantics of an algebraic kind
one has to consider, at least, algebras together with a set of
designated elements, without any requirement about its definability
using the corresponding algebraic language. These pairs are the
logical matrices. Tarski defined the general concept of logical matrix
in the 1920s but the concept was already implicit in previous work by
&#321;ukasiewicz, Bernays, Post and others, who used truth-tables,
either in independence proofs or to define logics different from
classical logic. A <em>logical matrix</em> is a pair \(\langle \bA, D
\rangle\) where \(\bA\) is an algebra and \(D\) a
subset of the universe \(A\) of \(\bA\); the elements
of \(D\) are called the <em>designated elements</em> of
the matrix and accordingly \(D\) is called <em>the set
of designated elements</em> (and some authors call it the <em>truth
set</em> of the matrix). Logical matrices were first used as models of
the theorems of specific logic systems, for instance in the work of
McKinsey and Tarski, and also to define sets of formulas with similar
properties to those of the set of theorems of a logic system, namely
closure under substitution instances. This was the case of the \(n\)-valued
logics of &#321;ukasiewicz and of his
infinite-valued logic. And it was Tarski who first considered logical
matrices as a general tool to define this kind of sets.</p>

<p>
The general theory of logical matrices explained in this entry is due
mainly to Polish logicians, starting with &#321;o&#347; 1949 and
continuing in &#321;o&#347; &amp; Suszko 1958, building on previous
work by Lindenbaum. In &#321;o&#347; and Suszko&rsquo;s paper matrices
are used for the first time both as models of logic systems (in our
sense) and to define systems of these kind.</p>

<p>
In the rest of the section, we present the relevant concepts of the
theory of logical matrices using modern terminology.</p>

<p>
Given a logic \(\bL\), a logical matrix \(\langle \bA, D \rangle\) is
said to be a <em>model</em> of \(\bL\) if wherever \(\Gamma
\vdash_{\bL } \phi\), then every valuation \(v\) on
\(\bA\) that maps the elements of \(\Gamma\) to some designated value
(i.e., an element of \(D)\) also maps \(\phi\) to a designated value.
When \(\langle \bA, D \rangle\) is a model of \(\bL\) it is said that
\(D\) is an \(\bL\)-<em>filter</em> of the algebra
\(\bA\). The set of \(\bL\)-filters of an algebra \(\bA\) plays a
crucial role in the theory of the algebraization of logic systems. We
will come to this point later.</p>

<p>
A class \(\bM\) of logical matrices is said to be a <em>matrix
semantics</em> for a logic \(\bL\) if</p>

<dl class="sentag tag3em">

<dt>(*)</dt>
<dd>\( \Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff\) for every \(\langle \bA, \tD
\rangle \in \bM\) and every valuation \(v\) on \(\bA\), if
\(\bv[\Gamma] \subseteq D\), then \(\bv(\phi) \in D\). </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The implication from left to right says that \(\bL\) is sound relative
to \(\bM\), and the other implication says that it is complete. In
other words, \(\bM\) is a matrix semantics for \(\bL\) if and only if
every matrix in \(\bM\) is a model of \(\bL\) and moreover for every
\(\Gamma\) and \(\phi\) such that \(\Gamma \not\vdash_{\bL } \phi\)
there is a model \(\langle \bA, \tD \rangle\) of \(\bL\) in \(\bM\)
that witnesses the fact, namely there is a valuation on the model that
sends the formulas in \(\Gamma\) to designated elements and \(\phi\)
to a non-designated one.</p>

<p>
Logical matrices are also used to define logics semantically. If \(\cM
= \langle \bA, D \rangle\) is a logical matrix, the relation defined
by</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\Gamma \vdash_{\cM } \phi\txtiff\) for every valuation \(v\)
on \(\bA\) if \(\bv(\psi) \in D\) for all \(\psi \in
\Gamma\), then \(\bv(\phi) \in D\)</p>
</div>

<p>
is a consequence relation which is substitution-invariant; therefore
\(\langle L, \vdash_{\cM } \rangle\) is a logic system. Similarly, we
can define the logic of a class of matrices \(\bM\) by taking
condition (*) as a definition of a consequence relation. In the entry
on
 <a href="../logic-manyvalued/index.html">many-valued logic</a>
 the reader can find several logics defined in this way.</p>

<p>Every logic (independently of how it is defined) has a matrix semantics. Moreover, every logic has a matrix semantics whose elements have the property of being reduced in the following sense: A matrix \(\langle \bA, D \rangle\) is <em>reduced</em> if there are no two different elements of \(A\) that behave in the same way. We say that \(a, b \in A\) <em>behave in the same way</em> in \(\langle \bA, D \rangle\) if for every formula \(\phi (q, p_1 , \ldots ,p_n)\) and all elements \(d_1 , \ldots ,d_n \in A\) \[\phi^{\bA }[a, d_1 , \ldots ,d_n] \in D \txtiff \phi^{\bA }[b, d_1 , \ldots ,d_n] \in D.\] Thus \(a, b \in A\) behave differently if there is a formula \(\phi(q, p_1 , \ldots ,p_n)\) and elements \(d_1 , \ldots ,d_n \in A\) such that one of \(\phi^{\bA }[a, d_1 , \ldots ,d_n]\) and \(\phi^{\bA }[b, d_1 , \ldots ,d_n]\) belongs to \(D\) but not both. The relation of behaving in the same way in \(\langle \bA, D \rangle\) is a congruence relation of \(\bA\). This relation is known after Blok &amp; Pigozzi 1986, 1989 as the <em>Leibniz congruence</em> of the matrix \(\langle \bA, D \rangle\) and is denoted by \(\bOmega_{\bA }(D)\). It can be characterized as the greatest congruence relation of \(\bA\) that is <em>compatible</em> with \(D\), that is, that does not relate elements in \(D\) with elements not in \(D\). The concept of Leibniz congruence plays a fundamental role in the general theory of the algebraization of the logic systems developed during the 1980s by Blok and Pigozzi. The reader is referred to Font, Jansana, &amp; Pigozzi 2003 and Czelakowski 2001 for extensive information on the developments around the concept of Leibniz congruence during this period.</p>

<p>
Every matrix \(\cM\) can be turned into a reduced matrix by
identifying the elements related by its Leibniz congruence. This
matrix is called the <em>reduction</em> of \(\cM\) and is usually
denoted by \(\cM^*\). A matrix and its reduction are models of the
same logic systems, and since reduced matrices have no redundant
elements, the classes of reduced matrices that are matrix semantics
for logic systems are usually taken as the classes of matrices that
deserve study; they are better suited to encoding in algebraic-like
terms the properties of the logics that have them as their matrix
semantics.</p>

<p>
The proof that every logic system has a reduced matrix semantics
(i.e., a matrix semantics consisting of reduced matrices) is as
follows. Let \(\bL\) be a logic system. Consider the matrices
\(\langle \bFm_L, T \rangle\) over the formula algebra, where \(T\)
is a theory of \(\bL\). These matrices are known as
the <em>Lindenbaum matrices</em> of \(\bL\). It is not difficult to
see that the class of those matrices is a matrix semantics for
\(\bL\). Since a matrix and its reduction are models of the same
logics, the reductions of the Lindenbaum matrices of \(\bL\)
constitute a matrix semantics for \(\bL\) too, and indeed a reduced
one. Moreover, any class of reduced matrix models of \(\bL\) that
includes the reduced Lindenbaum matrices of \(\bL\) is automatically a
complete matrix semantics for \(\bL\). In particular, the class of all
reduced matrix models of \(\bL\) is a complete matrix semantics for
\(\bL\). We denote this class by \(\bRMatr(\bL)\).</p>

<p>
The above proof can be seen as a generalization of the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method for proving algebraic completeness theorems
that we will discuss in the next section.</p>

<p>
The class of the algebras of the matrices in \(\bRMatr(\bL)\) plays a
prominent role in the theory of the algebraization of logics and it is
denoted by \(\bAlg^*\bL\). It has been considered for a long time the
natural class of algebras that has to be associated with a given logic
\(\bL\) as its algebraic counterpart. For instance, in the examples
considered above the classes of algebras that were given as algebraic
semantics of the different logics (Boolean algebras, Heyting algebras,
etc.) are exactly the class \(\bAlg^*\bL\) of the corresponding logic
\(\bL\). And in fact, the class \(\bAlg^*\bL\) coincides with what was
taken to be the natural class of algebras for all the logics \(\bL\)
studied up to the 1990s. In the 1990s, due to the knowledge acquired
of several logics not studied before, some authors proposed another
way to define the class of algebras that has to be counted as the
algebraic counterpart to be associated with a given logic \(\bL\). For
many logics \(\bL\), it leads exactly to the class \(\bAlg^*\bL\) but
for others it gives a class that extends it properly. We will discuss
it in
 <a href="#NatuClasAlgeLogiSyst">Section 8</a>.</p>
 
<h2 id="LindTarsMethForProvAlgeCompTheo">7. The Lindenbaum-Tarski method for proving algebraic completeness theorems</h2>

<p>
We now discuss the method that is most commonly used to prove that a
class of algebras \(\bK\) is a \(\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p)\)-algebraic semantics for a logic \(\bL\), namely the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method. It is the standard method used to prove that
the classes of algebras of the examples mentioned in
 <a href="#AlgeSema">Section 5</a>
 are algebraic semantics for the corresponding logics.</p>

<p>
The Lindenbaum-Tarski method contributed in two respects to the
elaboration of important notions in the theory of the algebraization
of logics. It underlies Blok and Pigozzi&rsquo;s notion of
algebraizable logic and reflecting on it some ways to define for each
logic a class of algebras can be justified as providing a natural
class. We will consider this issue in
 <a href="#NatuClasAlgeLogiSyst">Section 8</a>.</p>
 

<p>
The Lindenbaum-Tarski method can be outlined as follows. To prove that
a class of algebras \(\bK\) is a \(\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p)\)-algebraic semantics for a logic \(\bL\) first it is
shown that \(\bK\) gives a sound \(\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p)\)-semantics for \(\bL\), namely that if \(\Gamma
\vdash_{\bL } \phi\), then for every \(\bA \in \bK\) and every
valuation \(v\) in \(\bA\) if the values of the
formulas in \(\Gamma\) satisfy \(\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p)\),
then the value of \(\phi\) does too. Secondly, the other direction,
that is, the completeness part, is proved by what is properly known as
the Lindenbaum-Tarski method. This method uses the theories of \(\bL\)
to obtain matrices on the algebra of formulas and then reduces these
matrices in order to get for each one a matrix whose algebra is in
\(\bK\) and whose set of designated elements is the set of elements of
the algebra that satisfy \(\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p)\). We
proceed to describe the method step by step.</p>

<p>
Let \(\bL\) be one of the logics discussed in the examples in
 <a href="#AlgeSema">Section 5</a>.
 Let \(\bK\) be the corresponding class of algebras we considered
there and let \(\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p)\) be the equation in
one variable involved in the soundness and completeness theorem. To
prove the completeness theorem one proceeds as follows. Given any set
of formulas \(\Gamma\):</p>

<ol> 

	<li id="cond1">The theory \(C_{\bL }(\Gamma) = \{\phi : \Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi \}\) of \(\Gamma\), which we denote by \(T\), is considered and the binary relation \(\theta(T)\) on the set of formulas is defined using the formula \(p \leftrightarrow q\) as follows: \[\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \theta(T) \txtiff \phi \leftrightarrow \psi \in T.\]</li>

<li id="cond2">It is shown that \(\theta(T)\) is a congruence relation
on \(\bFm_L\). The set \([\phi]\) of the formulas related to the
formula \(\phi\) by \(\theta(T)\) is called the equivalence class of
\(\phi\).</li> 

	<li id="cond3">A new matrix \(\langle \bFm/\theta(T), T/\theta(T) \rangle\) is obtained by identifying the formulas related by \(\theta(T)\), that is, \(\bFm/\theta(T)\) is the quotient algebra of \(\bFm\) modulo \(\theta(T)\) and \(T/\theta(T)\) is the set of equivalence classes of the elements of \(T\). Recall that the algebraic operations of the quotient algebra are defined by: \[* ^{\bFm/\theta(T) }([\phi_1],\ldots ,[\phi_n]) = [* \phi_1 \ldots \phi_n ] \;\;\; \text{and} \;\;\; \dagger^{\bFm/\theta(T) } = [\dagger]\]</li>

 

	<li id="cond4">It is shown that \(\theta(T)\) is a relation compatible with \(T\), i.e., that if \(\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \theta(T)\) and \(\phi \in T\), then \(\psi \in T\). This implies that \[\phi \in T \txtiff [\phi] \subseteq T \txtiff [\phi] \in T/\theta(T).\]</li>

<li id="cond5">It is proved that the matrix \(\langle \bFm/\theta(T),
T/\theta(T) \rangle\) is reduced, that \(\bFm/\theta(T)\) belongs to
\(\bK\) and that \(T/\theta(T)\) is the set of elements of
\(\bFm/\theta(T)\) that satisfy the equation \(\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p)\) in \(\bFm/\theta(T)\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The proof of the completeness theorem then proceeds as follows.
 <a href="#cond4">(4)</a>
 and
 <a href="#cond5">(5)</a>
 imply that for every formula \(\psi , \Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \psi\) if
and only if \([\psi]\) satisfies the equation \(\delta(p) \approx
\varepsilon(p)\) in the algebra \(\bFm/\theta(T)\). Thus, considering
the valuation \(id\) mapping every variable \(p\) to
its equivalence class \([p]\), whose extension \(\boldsymbol{id}\) to
the set of all formulas is such that \(\boldsymbol{id}(\phi) =
[\phi]\) for every formula \(\phi\), we have for every formula
\(\psi\),</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \psi \txtiff\boldsymbol{id}(\psi)\) satisfies
the equation \(\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p)\) in
\(\bFm/\theta(T)\).</p>
</div>

<p>
Hence, since by
 <a href="#cond5">(5)</a>,
 \(\bFm/\theta(T) \in \bK\), it follows that if \(\Gamma
\not\vdash_{\bL }\phi\), then there is an algebra \(\bA \in \bK\)
(namely \(\bFm/\theta(T))\) and a valuation \(v\)
(namely \(id)\) such that the elements of \(\bv[\Gamma]\) satisfy the
equation on \(\bA\) but \(\bv(\phi)\) does not.</p>

<p>
The Lindenbaum-Tarski method, when successful, shows that the class of
algebras \(\{\bFm/\theta(T): T\) is a theory of \(\bL\}\) is a
\(\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p)\)-algebraic semantics for \(\bL\).
Therefore it also shows that every class of algebras \(\bK\) which is
\(\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p)\)-sound for \(\bL\) and includes
the set \(\{\bFm/\theta(T): T\) is a theory of \(\bL\}\) is also a
\(\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p)\)-algebraic semantics for
\(\bL\).</p>

<p>
Let us make some remarks on the Lindenbaum-Tarski method just
described. The first is important for the generalizations leading to
the classes of algebras associated with a logic. The others, to obtain
the conditions in the definition of the concept of algebraizable
logic.</p>

<ol>

<li>Conditions
 <a href="#cond4">(4)</a>
 and
 <a href="#cond5">(5)</a>
 imply that \(\theta(T)\) is in fact the Leibniz congruence of
\(\langle \bFm_L, T \rangle\).</li> 

	<li>When the Lindenbaum-Tarski method succeeds, it usually holds that in every algebra \(\bA \in \bK\), the relation defined by the equation \[\delta(p \leftrightarrow q) \approx \varepsilon(p \leftrightarrow q),\] which is the result of replacing in \(\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p)\) the letter \(p\) by the formula \(p \leftrightarrow q\) that defines the congruence relation of a theory, is the identity relation on \(A\).</li>

<li>For every formula \(\phi\), the formulas \(\delta(p/\phi)
\leftrightarrow \varepsilon(p/\phi)\) and \(\phi\) are interderivable
in \(\bL\) (i.e., \(\phi \vdash_{\bL } \delta(p/\phi) \leftrightarrow
\varepsilon(p/\phi)\) and \(\delta(p/\phi) \leftrightarrow
\varepsilon(p/\phi) \vdash_{\bL } \phi)\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The concept of algebraizable logic introduced by Blok and Pigozzi,
which we will discuss in
 <a href="#WhenLogiAlgeWhatDoesMean">Section 9</a>,
 can be described roughly by saying that a logic \(\bL\) is
algebraizable if it has an algebraic semantics \((\bK, \iEq)\) such
that (1) \(\bK\) is included in the natural class of algebras
\(\bAlg^*\bL\) associated with \(\bL\) and (2) the fact that \((\bK,
\iEq)\) is an algebraic semantics can be proved by using the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method slightly generalized.</p>

<h2 id="NatuClasAlgeLogiSyst">8. The natural class of algebras of a logic system</h2>

<p>
We shall now discuss the two definitions that have been considered as
providing natural classes of algebras associated with a logic \(\bL\).
Both definitions can be seen as arising from an abstraction of the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method and we follow this path in introducing them.
The common feature of these abstractions is that in them the specific
way in which the relation \(\theta(T)\) is defined in the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method is disregarded.</p>

<p>
It has to be remarked that, nonetheless, for many logics both
definitions lead to the same class. The classes obtained from both
definitions have been taken in the algebraic studies of many
particular logics (for some logics one, for others the other) as the
natural class that deserves to be studied.</p>

<p>
We already encountered the first generalization in
 <a href="#LogiMatr">Section 6</a>
 when we showed that every logic has a reduced matrix semantics. It
leads to the class of algebras \(\bAlg^*\bL\). That its definition is
a generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski method comes from the
realization that the relation \(\theta(T)\), associated with an
\(\bL\)-theory, defined in the different completeness proofs in the
literature that use the Lindenbaum-Tarski method is in fact the
Leibniz congruence of the matrix \(\langle \bFm_L, T \rangle\) and
that therefore the matrix \(\langle \bFm/\theta(T), T/\theta(T)
\rangle\) is its reduction. As we mentioned in
 <a href="#LogiMatr">Section 6</a>,
 for every logic \(\bL\), every \(\bL\)-sound class of matrices
\(\bM\) that contains all the matrices \(\langle \bFm/\bOmega_{\bFm_L
}(T), T/ \bOmega_{\bFm_L }(T) \rangle\), where \(T\) is
a theory of \(\bL\), is a complete reduced matrix semantics for
\(\bL\). From this perspective the notion of the Leibniz congruence of
a matrix can be taken as a generalization to arbitrary matrices of the
idea that comes from the Lindenbaum-Tarski procedure of proving
completeness. Following this course of reasoning, the class
\(\bAlg^*\bL\) of the algebras of the reduced matrix models of a logic
\(\bL\) is a very natural class of algebras to associate with \(\bL\).
It is the class</p>

<p class="center">
\(\{\bA/\bOmega_{\bA }(F): \bA\) is an \(\bL\)-algebra and \(F\)
is a \(\bL\)-filter of \(\bA\}\).</p>

<p>
The second way of generalizing the Lindenbaum-Tarski method uses a
different fact, namely that in the examples discussed in
 <a href="#SomeExamLogi">Section 3</a>
 the relation \(\theta(T)\) is also the relation
\(\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bFm_L }(T)\) defined by the condition</p>

<div class="smaller">
\[\begin{align*} \langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \bOmega^{\sim}_{\bFm_L }(T)\txtiff &amp; \forall T' \in \tTH(\bL),\\ 
 &amp; \forall p \in V, \\ 
 &amp;\forall \gamma(p) \in \bFm_L (T \subseteq T' \Rightarrow (\gamma(p/\phi) \in T' \Leftrightarrow \gamma(p/\psi) \in T')). 
\end{align*}\]
</div>
 

<p>For every logic \(\bL\) and every \(\bL\)-theory \(T\) the relation \(\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bFm_L }(T)\) defined in this way is the greatest congruence compatible with all the \(\bL\)-theories that extend \(T\). Therefore, it holds that \[\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bFm_L }(T) = \bigcap_{T' \in \tTH(\bL)^T} \bOmega_{\bFm_L }(T'),\] where \(\tTH(\bL)^T = \{T' \in \tTH(\bL): T \subseteq T'\}\). The relation \(\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bFm_L }(T)\) is known as the <em>Suszko congruence</em> of \(T\) (w.r.t. \(\bL)\). Suszko defined it &mdash;in an equivalent way&mdash; in 1977.</p>

 

<p>For every logic \(\bL\), the notion of the Suszko congruence can be extended to its matrix models. The <em>Suszko congruence</em> of a matrix model \(\langle \bA, D \rangle\) of \(\bL\) (w.r.t. \(\bL)\) is the greatest congruence of \(\bA\) compatible with every \(\bL\)-filter of \(\bA\) that includes \(D\), that is, it is the relation given by \[{\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA}}^{\bL}(D) = \bigcap_{D' \in \tFi_{\bL}(\bA)^D} \bOmega_{\bA}(D')\] where \(\tFi_{\bL}(\bA)^D = \{D': D'\) is a \(\bL\)-filter of \(\bA\) and \(D \subseteq D'\}\). Notice that unlike the intrinsic notion of Leibniz congruence, the Suszko congruence of a matrix model of \(\bL\) is not intrinsic to the matrix: it depends in an essential way on the logic under consideration. The theory of the Suszko congruence of matrices has been developed in Czelakowski 2003 and continued in Albuquerque &amp; Font &amp; Jansana 2016.</p>

<p>
In the same manner that the concept of Leibniz congruence leads to the
concept of reduced matrix, the notion of Suszko congruence leads to
the notion of Suszko-reduced matrix. A matrix model of \(\bL\) is
<em>Suszko-reduced</em> if its Suszko congruence is the identity. Then
the class of algebras of the Suszko-reduced matrix models of a logic
\(\bL\) is another class of algebras that is taken as a natural class
of algebras to associate with \(\bL\). It is the class </p>

<p class="center">
\(\bAlg\bL = \{\bA / {\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA}}^{\bL}(F): \bA\) is an
\(\bL\)-algebra and \(F\) is a \(\bL\)-filter of
\(\bA\}\).</p>

<p>
This class is nowadays taken in abstract algebraic logic as
<em>the</em> natural class of algebras to be associated with \(\bL\)
and it called its <em>algebraic counterpart</em>.</p>

<p>
For an arbitrary logic \(\bL\), the relation between the classes
\(\bAlg\bL\) and \(\bAlg^*\bL\) is that \(\bAlg\bL\) is the closure of
\(\bAlg^*\bL\) under subdirect products, in particular \(\bAlg^*\bL
\subseteq \bAlg\bL\). In general, the two classes may be different. For
example, if \(\bL\) is the \((\wedge , \vee)\)-fragment of classical
propositional logic, \(\bAlg\bL\) is the variety of distributive
lattices (the class that has been always taken to be the natural class
of algebras associated with \(\bL)\) while \(\bAlg^*\bL\) is properly
included in it &mdash;in fact \(\bAlg^*\bL\) is not a quasivariety.
Nonetheless, for many logics \(\bL\), in particular for the
algebraizable and the protoalgebraic ones to be discussed in the next
sections, and also when \(\bAlg^*\bL\) is a variety, the classes
\(\bAlg\bL\) and \(\bAlg^*\bL\) are equal. This fact can explain why
in the 1980s, before the algebraic study of non-protoalgebraic logics
was considered worth to be pursued, the conceptual difference between
the two definitions was not needed and, accordingly, it was not
considered (or even discovered).</p>

<h2 id="WhenLogiAlgeWhatDoesMean">9. When a logic is algebraizable and what does this mean?</h2>

<p>
The algebraizable logics are purported to be the logics with the
strongest possible link with their algebraic counterpart. This
requirement demands that the algebraic counterpart of the logic should
be an algebraic semantics but requires a more robust connection
between the logic and the algebraic counterpart than that. This more
robust connection is present in the best behaved particular logics
known. The mathematically precise concept of algebraizable logic
characterizes this type of link. Blok and Pigozzi introduced that
fundamental concept in Blok &amp; Pigozzi 1989 and its introduction
can be considered the starting point of the unification and growth of
the field of abstract algebraic logic in the 1980s. Blok and Pigozzi
defined the notion of algebraizable logic only for finitary logics.
Later, Czelakowski and Herrmann generalized it to arbitrary logics and
also weakened some conditions in the definition. We present here the
generalized concept.</p>

<p>
We said in
 <a href="#LindTarsMethForProvAlgeCompTheo">Section 7</a>
 that, roughly speaking, a logic \(\bL\) is algebraizable when 1) it
has an algebraic semantics, i.e., a class of algebras \(\bK\) and a
set of equations \(\iEq(p)\) such that \(\bK\) is a \(\iEq\)-algebraic
semantics for \(\bL\), 2) this fact can be proved by using the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method slightly generalized and, moreover, 3) \(\bK
\subseteq \bAlg^*\bL\). The generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski
method (as we described it in
 <a href="#LindTarsMethForProvAlgeCompTheo">Section 7</a>)
 consists in allowing in step (5) (as already done in the definition
of algebraic semantics) a set of equations \(\iEq(p)\) in one variable
instead of a single equation \(\delta(p) \approx \varepsilon(p)\) and
in allowing in a similar manner a set of formulas \(\Delta(p, q)\) in
at most two variables to play the role of the formula \(p
\leftrightarrow q\) in the definition of the congruence of a theory.
Then, given a theory \(T\), the relation \(\theta(T)\),
which has to be the greatest congruence on the formula algebra
compatible with \(T\) (i.e., the Leibniz congruence of
\(T)\), is defined by</p> 

\[\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \theta(T) \txtiff \Delta(p/\phi , q/\psi) \subseteq T.\]

<p>
We need some notational conventions before engaging in the precise
definition of algebraizable logic. Given a set of equations
\(\iEq(p)\) in one variable and a formula \(\phi\), let \(\iEq(\phi)\)
be the set of equations obtained by replacing in all the equations in
\(\iEq\) the variable \(p\) by \(\phi\). If \(\Gamma\)
is a set of formulas, let</p> 

\[\iEq(\Gamma) := \bigcup_{\phi \in \Gamma}\iEq(\phi).\]

<p>
Similarly, given a set of formulas in two variables \(\Delta(p, q)\)
and an equation \(\delta \approx \varepsilon\), let \(\Delta(\delta ,
\varepsilon)\) denote the set of formulas obtained by replacing \(p\)
by \(\delta\) and \(q\) by
\(\varepsilon\) in all the formulas in \(\Delta\). Moreover, if
\(\iEq\) is a set of equations, let</p> 

\[\Delta(\iEq) = \bigcup_{\delta \approx \varepsilon \in \iEq} \Delta(\delta , \varepsilon).\]

<p>
Given a set of equations \(\iEq(p, q)\) in two variables, this set
defines on every algebra \(\bA\) a binary relation, namely the set of
pairs \(\langle a, b\rangle\) of elements of \(A\) that
satisfy in \(\bA\) all the equations in \(\iEq(p, q)\). In standard
model-theoretic notation, this set is the relation</p> 

\[\{\langle a, b \rangle : a, b \in A \textrm{ and } \bA \vDash \iEq(p, q)[a, b]\}.\]

<p>
The formal definition of algebraizable logic is as follows. A logic
\(\bL\) is <em>algebraizable</em> if there is a class of algebras
\(\bK\), a set of equations \(\iEq(p)\) in one variable and a set of
formulas \(\Delta(p, q)\) in two variables such that</p>

<ol>

<li id="bcond1">\(\bK\) is an \(\iEq\)-algebraic semantics for
\(\bL\), namely

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff\) for every \(\bA \in \bK\) and
every valuation \(v\) on \(\bA\), if \(\bv[\Gamma]

<li id="bcond2">For every \(\bA \in \bK\), the relation defined by the

<p>
A class of algebras \(\bK\) for which there are sets \(\iEq(p)\) and
\(\Delta(p, q)\) with these two properties is said to be an
<em>equivalent algebraic semantics</em> for \(\bL\). The set of
formulas \(\Delta\) is called a <em>set of equivalence formulas</em>
and the set of equations \(\iEq\) a <em>set of defining
equations</em>.</p>

<p>
The conditions of the definition imply:</p>

<ol start="3"> 

	<li id="bcond3">\(p\) is inter-derivable in \(\bL\) with the set of formulas \(\Delta(\iEq)\), that is \[\Delta(\iEq) \vdash_{\bL } p \textrm{ and } p \vdash_{\bL } \Delta(\iEq).\]</li>

 

	<li id="bcond4">For every \(\bL\)-theory \(T\), the Leibniz congruence of \(\langle \bFm_L, T\rangle\) is the relation defined by \(\Delta(p, q)\), namely \[\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \bOmega_{\bFm }(T)\txtiff\Delta(p/\phi , q/\psi) \subseteq T.\]</li>

two sets of defining equations, for every algebra \(\bA \in \bK,
\iEq(\bA) = \iEq'(\bA)\).</li>

<li id="bcond6">The class of algebras \(\bAlg^*\bL\) also satisfies

Moreover, it is an SP-class and includes every other class of algebras

\(\bL\)-filter \(F\) such that the matrix \(\langle

Or, to put it in other terms, the class of reduced matrix models of
\(\bL\) is \(\{\langle \bA, \iEq(\bA) \rangle : \bA \in
\bAlg^*\bL\}\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
Blok and Pigozzi&rsquo;s definition of algebraizable logic in Blok
&amp; Pigozzi 1989 was given only for finitary logics and, moreover,
they imposed that the sets of defining equations and of equivalence
formulas should be finite. Today we say that an algebraizable logic is
<em>finitely algebraizable</em> if the sets of equivalence formulas
\(\Delta\) and of defining equations \(\iEq\) can both be taken
finite. And we say that a logic is Blok-Pigozzi algebraizable
(BP-algebraizable) if it is finitary and finitely algebraizable.</p>

<p>
If \(\bL\) is finitary and finitely algebraizable, then \(\bAlg^*\bL\)
is not only an SP-class, but a quasivariety and it is the quasivariety
generated by any class of algebras \(\bK\) which is an equivalent
algebraic semantics for \(\bL\).</p>

<p>
We have just seen that in algebraizable logics the class of algebras
\(\bAlg^*\bL\) plays a prominent role. Moreover, in these logics the
classes of algebras obtained by the two ways of generalizing the
Lindenbaum-Tarski method coincide, that is, \(\bAlg^*\bL = \bAlg\bL\)
&mdash;this is due to the fact that for any algebraizable logic
\(\bL\), \(\bAlg^*\bL\) is closed under subdirect products. Hence, for
every algebraizable logic \(\bL\) its algebraic counterpart
\(\bAlg\bL\) is its greatest equivalent algebraic semantics, whatever
perspective is taken on the generalization of the Lindenbaum-Tarski
method.</p>

<p>
Conditions
 <a href="#bcond1">(1)</a>
 and
 <a href="#bcond2">(2)</a>
 of the definition of algebraizable logic (instantiated to
\(\bAlg^*\bL\)) encode the fact that there is a very strong link
between an algebraizable logic \(\bL\) and its class of algebras
\(\bAlg\bL\), so that this class of algebras reflects the metalogical
properties of \(\bL\) by algebraic properties of \(\bAlg\bL\) and
conversely.</p>

<p>
The definition of algebraizable logic can be stated, equivalently, in terms of
translations between the logic and an equational consequence relation
\(\vDash_{\bK}\) associated with any equivalent algebraic semantics
\(\bK\) for it &mdash;that turns to be the same relation no matter
what equivalent algebraic semantics we choose.</p>

<p>
The equational consequence \(\vDash_{\bK}\) of a class of algebras
\(\bK\) is defined as follows.</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\{\phi_i \approx \psi_i: i \in I\} \vDash_{\bK } \phi \approx \psi
\txtiff\)for every \(\bA \in \bK\) and every valuation \(v\)
on \(\bA\), if \(\bv(\phi_i) = \bv(\psi_i)\), for all
\(i \in I\), then \(\bv(\phi) = \bv(\psi)\).</p>
</div>

<p>
The translations needed are given by the set of defining equations and
the set of equivalence formulas. A set of equations \(\iEq(p)\) in one
variable defines a <em>translation from formulas to sets of
equations</em>: each formula is translated into the set of equations
\(\iEq(\phi).\) Similarly, a set of formulas \(\Delta(p, q)\) in two
variables defines a <em>translation from equations to sets of
formulas</em>: each equation \(\phi \approx \psi\) is translated into
the set of formulas \(\Delta(\phi , \psi)\).</p> 

<p>Condition <a href="#bcond1">(1)</a> in the definition of algebraizable logic can be reformulated as \[\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff \iEq(\Gamma) \vDash_{\bK } \iEq(\phi)\] and condition <a href="#bcond2">(2)</a> as \[p \approx q \vDash_{\bK } \iEq(\Delta(p, q)) \textrm{ and } \iEq(\Delta(p, q)) \vDash_{\bK } p \approx q.\]</p>

These two conditions imply</p>

 <a href="#bcond3">(3)</a>
 above is</p> 

\[p \vdash_{\bL } \Delta(\iEq(p)) \textrm{ and } \Delta(\iEq(p)) \vdash_{\bL } p.\]

<p>
Thus, an algebraizable logic \(\bL\) is faithfully interpreted in the
equational logic of its equivalent algebraic semantics (condition
 <a href="#bcond2">(1)</a>)
 by means of the translation of formulas into sets of equations given
by a set of defining equations, and the equational logic of its
equivalent algebraic semantics is faithfully interpreted in the logic
\(\bL\) (condition
 <a href="#bcond9">(9)</a>)
 by means of the translation of equations into sets of formulas given
by an equivalence set of formulas. Moreover, both translations are
inverses of each other (conditions
 <a href="#bcond2">(2)</a>
 and
 <a href="#bcond3">(3)</a>)
 modulo logical equivalence. In this way we see that the link between
\(\bL\) and its greatest equivalent algebraic semantics is very strong
and that the properties of \(\bL\) should translate into properties of
the associated equational consequence relation. The properties that
this relation actually has of course depend on the properties of the
class of algebras \(\bAlg\bL\).</p>

<p>
Given an algebraic semantics \((\bK, \iEq)\) for a logic \(\bL\), a
way to stress the difference between it being merely an algebraic
semantics and being an algebraic semantics that makes \(\bL\)
algebraizable is that the translation of formulas into equations given
by the set of equations \(\iEq\) is invertible in the sense that there
is a translation, say \(\Delta\), of equations into formulas given by
a set of formulas in two variables that satisfies condition
 <a href="#bcond9">(9)</a>
 above, and such that \(\iEq\) and \(\Delta\) provide mutually
inverses translations (i.e., conditions
 <a href="#bcond2">(2)</a>
 and
 <a href="#bcond3">(3)</a>
 hold).</p>

<p>
The link between an algebraizable logic \(\bL\) and its greatest
equivalent algebraic semantics given by the set of defining equations
and the set of equivalence formulas allows us to prove a series of
general theorems that relate the properties of \(\bL\) with the
properties of \(\bAlg\bL\). These kinds of theorems are called
frequently bridge theorems. We will mention as a sample  three of
them.</p>

<p>
The first concerns the deduction theorem. To prove a general theorem
relating the existence of a deduction theorem with an algebraic
property requires first that a concept of deduction theorem applicable
to any logic has to be defined. A logic \(\bL\) has the
<em>deduction-detachment property</em> if there is a finite set of
formulas \(\Sigma(p, q)\) such that for every set of formulas
\(\Gamma\) and all formulas \(\phi , \psi\)</p> 

\[\Gamma \cup \{\phi \} \vdash_{\bL } \psi\txtiff\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \Sigma(\phi , \psi).\]

<p>
Note that this is a generalization of the standard deduction theorem
(the direction from left to right in the above expression) and Modus
Ponens (equivalent to the implication from right to left) that several
logics have for a connective \(\rightarrow\). In those cases
\(\Sigma(p, q) = \{p \rightarrow q\}\).</p>

<p class="indent" id="theorem1">
<strong>Theorem 1.</strong>
<br />
A finitary and finitely algebraizable logic \(\bL\) has the
deduction-detachment property if and only if the principal relative
congruences of the algebras in \(\bAlg\bL\) are equationally
definable.</p>

<p>
The second theorem refers to Craig interpolation. Several notions of
interpolation are applicable to arbitrary logics. We consider only one
of them. A logic \(\bL\) has the <em>Craig interpolation property</em>
for the consequence relation if whenever \(\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi\) and the set of variables of \(\phi\) has nonempty intersection with the set of variables of formulas in \(\Gamma\), 
there is a finite set of formulas \(\Gamma '\) whose set of variables is included in the set of variables
shared by \(\phi\) and the formulas in \(\Gamma\) such that \(\Gamma
\vdash_{\bL } \Gamma '\) and \(\Gamma ' \vdash_{\bL } \phi\).</p>

<p class="indent" id="theorem2">
<strong>Theorem 2.</strong>
<br />
Let \(\bL\) be a finitary and finitely algebraizable logic with the
deduction-detachment property. Then \(\bL\) has the Craig
interpolation property if and only if \(\bAlg\bL\) has the
amalgamation property.</p>

<p>
Finally, the third theorem concerns the Beth definability property.
The interested reader can find the definition in Font, Jansana &amp;
Pigozzi 2003.  In the general setting we are in, the property is too involved to state it here.</p>

<p class="indent" id="theorem3">
<strong>Theorem 3.</strong>
<br />
A finitary and finitely algebraizable logic has the Beth property if
and only if all the epimorphisms of the category with objects the
algebras in \(\bAlg\bL\) and morphisms the algebraic homomorphisms are
surjective homomorphisms.</p>

<p>
Other results relating properties of an algebraizable logic with a
property of its natural class of algebras can be found in Raftery
2011, 2013. They concern respectively a generalization of the property
of having the deduction-detachment property and the property that
generalize the inconsistency lemmas of classical and intuitionistic
logic. Also an abstract notion of having a theorem like
Glivenko&rsquo;s theorem relating classical and intuitionistic logic
has been proposed and related to an algebraic property in the case of
algebraizable logics in Torrens 2008. More recently Raftery 2016
presents bridge theorems related to admissible rules and to structural
completeness and L&#225;vi&#269;ka et al. 2021 studies bridge theorems for
the property of the weak excluded middle.</p>

<p>
For several classes of algebras that are the equivalent algebraic
semantics of some algebraizable logic it has been known for a long
time that for every algebra in the class there is an isomorphism
between the lattice of congruences of the algebra and a lattice of
subsets of the algebra with important algebraic meaning. For example,
in Boolean algebras and Heyting algebras these subsets are the lattice
filters and in modal algebras they are the lattice filters that are
closed under the operation that interprets \(\Box\). In all those
cases, the sets are exactly the \(\bL\)-filters of the corresponding
algebraizable logic \(\bL\).</p>

<p>
Algebraizable logics can be characterized by the existence of this
kind of isomorphism between congruences and logic filters on the
algebras of their algebraic counterpart. To spell out this
characterization we need a couple of definitions. Let \(\bL\) be a
logic. The <em>Leibniz operator</em> on an algebra \(\bA\) (relative
to \(\bL)\) is the map from the \(\bL\)-filters of \(\bA\) to the set
of congruences of \(\bA\) that sends every \(\bL\)-filter \(D\)
of \(\bA\) to its Leibniz congruence \(\bOmega_{\bA
}(D)\). We say that the Leibniz operator of a logic \(\bL\)
<em>commutes with the inverses of homomorphisms</em> between algebras
in a class \(\bK\) if for every homomorphism \(h\) from
an algebra \(\bA \in \bK\) to an algebra \(\bB \in \bK\) and every
\(\bL\)-filter \(D\) of \(\bB, h^{-1}[\bOmega_{\bB
}(D)] = \bOmega_{\bA }(h^{-1}[D]\)).</p>

<p class="indent" id="theorem4">
<strong>Theorem 4.</strong>
<br />
A logic \(\bL\) is algebraizable if and only if for every algebra
\(\bA \in \bAlg\bL\) the Leibniz operator commutes with the inverses
of homomorphisms between algebras in \(\bAlg\bL\) and is an
isomorphism between the set of all \(\bL\)-filters of \(\bA\), ordered
by inclusion, and the set of congruences \(\theta\) of \(\bA\) such
that \(\bA/\theta \in \bAlg\bL\), ordered also by inclusion.</p>

<p>
The theorem provides a logical explanation of the known isomorphisms
mentioned above and similar ones for other classes of algebras. For
example, the isomorphism between the congruences and the normal
subgroups of a group can be explained by the existence of an
algebraizable logic \(\bL\) of which the class of groups is its
greatest equivalent algebraic semantics and the normal subgroups of a
group are its \(\bL\)-filters.</p>

<p>
A different but related characterization of algebraizable logics is
this:</p>

<p class="indent" id="theorem5">
<strong>Theorem 5.</strong>
<br />
A logic \(\bL\) is algebraizable if and only if on the algebra of
formulas \(\bFm_L\), the map that sends every theory \(T\)
to its Leibniz congruence commutes with the inverses
of homomorphisms from \(\bFm_L\) to \(\bFm_L\) and it is an
isomorphism between the set \(\tTH(\bL)\) of theories of \(\bL\),
ordered by inclusion, and the set of congruences \(\theta\) of
\(\bFm_L\) such that \(\bFm_L /\theta \in \bAlg\bL\), also ordered by
inclusion.</p>

<h2 id="ClasLogi">10. A classification of logics</h2>

<p>
Unfortunately, not every logic is algebraizable. A typical example of a
non-algebraizable logic is the local consequence of the normal modal
logic \(K\). Let us discuss this example.</p>

<p>
The local modal logic \(\blK\) and the corresponding global one
\(\bgK\) are not only different, but their metalogical properties
differ. For example, \(\blK\) has the deduction-detachment property
for \(\rightarrow\):</p> 

\[\Gamma \cup \{\phi \} \vdash_{\blK } \psi\txtiff \Gamma \vdash_{\blK } \phi \rightarrow \psi.\]

<p>
But \(\bgK\) does not have the deduction-detachment property (at
all).</p>

<p>
The logic \(\bgK\) is algebraizable and \(\blK\) is not. The
equivalent algebraic semantics of \(\bgK\) is the variety \(\bMA\) of
modal algebras, the set of equivalence formulas is the set \(\{p
\leftrightarrow q\}\) and the set of defining equations is \(\{p
\approx \top \}\). Interestingly, \(\blK\) and \(\bgK\) have the same
algebraic counterpart (i.e., \(\bAlg \blK = \bAlg \bgK)\), namely, the
variety of modal algebras.</p>

<p>
A lesson to draw from this example is that the algebraic counterpart
\(\bAlg\bL\) of a logic \(\bL\) does not necessarily fully encode the
properties of \(\bL\). The class of modal algebras encodes the
properties of \(\bgK\) because this logic is algebraizable and
therefore the link between \(\bgK\) and \(\bAlg \bgK\) is as strong as
possible. But \(\bAlg \blK\), the class of modal algebras, cannot by
itself completely encode the properties of \(\blK\).</p> 

<p>What causes this difference between \(\bgK\) and \(\blK\) is that the class of reduced matrix models of \(\bgK\) is \[\{\langle \bA, \{1^{\bA }\}\rangle : \bA \in \bMA\},\] but the class of reduced matrix models of \(\blK\) properly includes this class so that for some algebras \(\bA \in \bMA\), in addition to \(\{1^{\bA }\}\) there is some other \(\blK\)-filter \(F\) with \(\langle \bA, F \rangle\) reduced. This fact provides a way to show that \(\blK\) can not be algebraizable by showing that the \(\blK\)-filters of the reduced matrices are not equationally definable from the algebras; if they where, then for every \(\bA \in \bAlg \blK\) there would exist exactly one \(\blK\)-filter \(F\) of \(\bA\) such that \(\langle \bA, F \rangle\) is reduced.</p>

<p>
Nonetheless, we can perform some of the steps of the Lindenbaum-Tarski
method in the logic \(\blK\). We can define the Leibniz congruence of
every \(\blK\)-theory in a uniform way by using formulas in two
variables. But in this particular case the set of formulas has to be
infinite. Let \(\Delta(p, q) = \{\Box^n (p \leftrightarrow q): n\) a
natural number\(\}\), where for every formula \(\phi , \Box^0\phi\) is
\(\phi\) and \(\Box^n\phi\) for \(n \gt 0\) is the formula \(\phi\)
with a sequence of \(n\) boxes in front \((\Box
\ldots \Box \phi)\). Then, for every \(\blK\)-theory \(T\)
the relation \(\theta(T)\) defined by</p>

\[\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \theta(T)\txtiff \{\Box^n (\phi \leftrightarrow \psi): n \textrm{ a natural number}\} \subseteq T\]

<p>
is the Leibniz congruence of \(T\). In this case, it
happens though that there are two different \(\blK\)-theories with the
same Leibniz congruence, something that does not hold for
\(\bgK\).</p> 

<p>The logics \(\bL\) with the property that there is a set of formulas (possibly infinite) \(\Delta(p, q)\) in two variables that defines in every \(\bL\)-theory \(T\) its Leibniz congruence, that is, that for all \(L\)-formulas \(\phi , \psi\) it holds \[\langle \phi , \psi \rangle \in \bOmega_{\bFm }(T)\txtiff \Delta(\phi , \psi) \subseteq T,\] are known as the <em>equivalential logics</em>. If \(\Delta(p, q)\) is finite, the logic is said to be <em>finitely equivalential</em>. A set \(\Delta(p, q)\) that defines in every \(\bL\)-theory its Leibniz congruence is called a <em>set of equivalence formulas</em> for \(\bL\). It is clear that every algebraizable logic is equivalential and that every finitely algebraizable logic is finitely equivalential.</p>

<p>
The logic \(\blK\) is, according to the definition, equivalential, and
it can be shown that it is not finitely equivalential. The local modal
logic <strong>lS</strong>4 is an example of a non-algebraizable logic
that is finitely equivalential. A set of equivalence formulas for
<strong>lS</strong>4 is \(\{\Box(p\leftrightarrow q)\}\).</p>

<p>
A set of equivalence formulas for a logic \(\bL\) should be considered
as a generalized biconditional, in the sense that collectively the
formulas in the set have the relevant properties of the biconditional,
for example in classical logic, that makes it suitable to define the
Leibniz congruences of its theories. This comes out very clearly from
the following syntactic characterization of the sets of equivalence
formulas.</p>

<div class="indent" id="theorem6">
<strong>Theorem 6.</strong>
<br />
A set \(\Delta(p, q)\) of \(L\)-formulas is a set of
equivalence formulas for a logic \(\bL\) if and only if

<dl class="sentag tag4em">

<dt>\((\tR_{\Delta})\)</dt>
<dd>\(\vdash_{\bL } \Delta(p, p)\)</dd>

\Delta(* p_1 \ldots p_n, * q_1 \ldots q_n)\), for every connective
\(*\) of \(L\) of arity \(n\) greater that 0.</dd>
</dl>

</div>

<p>
There is some redundancy in the theorem. Conditions \((\tS_{\Delta})\)
and \((\tT_{\Delta})\) follow from \((\tR_{\Delta}),(\tMP_{\Delta})\)
and \((\tRe_{\Delta})\).</p>

<p>
Equivalential logics were first considered as a class of logics
deserving to be studied in Prucnal &amp; Wro&#324;ski 1974, and they
were studied extensively in Czelakowski 1981; see also Czelakowski
2001.</p>

<p>
We already mentioned that the algebraizable logics are equivalential.
The difference between an equivalential logic and an algebraizable one
can be seen in the following syntactic characterization of
algebraizable logics:</p>

<div class="indent" id="theorem7">
<strong>Theorem 7.</strong>
<br />

A logic \(\bL\) is algebraizable if and only if there exists a set \(\Delta(p, q)\) of \(L\)-formulas and a set \(\iEq(p)\) of \(L\)-equations such that the conditions \((\tR_{\Delta})\)&ndash;\((\tRe_{\Delta})\) above hold for \(\Delta(p, q)\) and \[p \vdash_{\bL } \Delta(\iEq(p)) \textrm{ and } \Delta(\iEq(p)) \vdash_{\bL } p.\]</div>

<p>
The set \(\Delta(p, q)\) in the theorem is then an equivalence set of
formulas for \(\bL\) and the set \(\iEq(p)\) a set of defining
equations.</p>

<p>
There are logics that are not equivalential but have the property of
having a set of formulas \([p \Rightarrow q]\) which collectively
behave in a very weak sense as the implication \(\rightarrow\) does in
many logics. Namely, that has the properties \((\tR_{\Delta})\) and
\((\tMP_{\Delta})\) in the syntactic characterization of a set of
equivalence formulas, i.e.,</p>

<dl class="sentag tag4em">

<dt id="aprop1">\((\tR_{\Rightarrow})\) </dt>
<dd>\(\vdash_{\bL } [p \Rightarrow p]\)</dd>

<dt id="bprop2">\((\tMP_{\Rightarrow})\)</dt>
<dd>\(p, [p \Rightarrow q] \vdash_{\bL } q\)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
If a logic is finitary and has a set of formulas with these
properties, there is always a finite subset with the same properties.
The logics with a set of formulas (finite or not) with properties
 <a href="#aprop1">(1)</a>
 and
 <a href="#bprop2">(2)</a>
 above are called <em>protoalgebraic</em>. Thus, every equivalential
logic and every algebraizable logic are protoalgebraic.</p>

<p>
Protoalgebraic logics were first studied by Czelakowski, who called
them non-pathological, and  slightly later by Blok and Pigozzi in
Blok &amp; Pigozzi 1986. The label &lsquo;protoalgebraic logic&rsquo;
is due to these last two authors.</p>

<p>
The class of protoalgebraic logics turned out to be the class of
logics for which the theory of logical matrices works really well in
the sense that many results of universal algebra have counterparts for
the classes of reduced matrix models of these logics and many methods
of universal algebra can be adapted to its study; consequently the
algebraic study of protoalgebraic logics using their matrix semantics
has been extensively and very fruitfully pursued. But, as we will see,
some interesting logics are not protoalgebraic.</p>

<p>
An important characterization of protoalgebraic logics is via the
behavior of the Leibniz operator. The following conditions are
equivalent:</p>

<ol>

<li>\(\bL\) is protoalgebraic.</li>

<li>The Leibniz operator \(\bOmega_{\bFm_L}\) is monotone on the set
of \(\bL\)-theories with respect to the inclusion relation, that is,
if \(T \subseteq T'\) are \(\bL\)-theories, then \(\bOmega_{\bFm_L
}(T) \subseteq \bOmega_{\bFm_L }(T')\).</li>

<li>For every algebra \(\bA\), the Leibniz operator \(\bOmega_{\bA}\)
is monotone on the set of \(\bL\)-filters of \(\bA\) with respect to
the inclusion relation.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Due to the monotonicity property of the Leibniz operator, for every
protoalgebraic logic \(\bL\) the class of algebras \(\bAlg^*\bL\) is
closed under subdirect products and therefore it is equal to
\(\bAlg\bL\). Hence, for protoalgebraic logics the two ways we
encountered to associate a class of algebras with a logic produce, as
we already mentioned, the same result.</p>

<p>
There are also characterizations of equivalential and finitely
equivalential logics by the behavior of the Leibniz operator. The
reader is referred to Czelakowski 2001 and Font &amp; Jansana &amp;
Pigozzi 2003.</p>

<p>
In his Raftery 2006b, Raftery studies Condition 7 in the list of
properties of an algebraizable logic we gave just after the
definition. The condition says:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
For every \(\bA \in \bAlg^*\bL\) the class of reduced matrix models of
\(\bL\) is \(\{\langle \bA, \iEq(\bA) \rangle : \bA \in
\bAlg^*\bL\}\), where \(\iEq(p)\) is the set of defining equations for
\(\bL\).</p>
</div>

<p>
The logics with a set of equations \(\iEq(p)\) with this property,
namely such that for every \(\bA \in \bAlg^*\bL\) the class of reduced
matrix models of \(\bL\) is \(\{\langle \bA, \iEq(\bA) \rangle : \bA
\in \bAlg^*\bL\}\), are called <em>truth-equational</em>, a name
introduced in Raftery 2006b. Some truth-equational logics are
protoalgebraic but others are not. We will see later an example of the
last ones.</p>

<p>
The protoalgebraic logics that are truth-equational are in fact the
<em>weakly algebraizable logics</em> studied already in Czelakowski
&amp; Jansana 2000. Every algebraizable logic is weakly algebraizable.
In fact, the algebraizable logics are the equivalential logics that
are truth-equational. But not every weakly algebraizable logic is
equivalential. An example is the  logic determined by the
ortholattices, namely by the class of the matrices \(\langle \bA, \{1\}
\rangle\) where \(\bA\) is an ortholattice and 1 is its greatest
element (see Czelakowski &amp; Jansana 2000 and Malinowski 1990).</p>

<p>
The classes of logics we have considered so far are the main classes
in what has come to be known as the <em>Leibniz hierarchy</em> because
its members are classes of logics that can be characterized by the
behavior of the Leibniz operator. We described only the most important
classes of logics in the hierarchy. The reader is referred to
Czelakowski 2001, Font, Jansana &amp; Pigozzi 2003, Font 2016 and
2022, for more information. In particular, Czelakowski 2001 gathers
extensively the information on the different classes of the Leibniz
hierarchy known at the time of its publication and Font 2016 is an
introduction to abstract algebraic logic very well suited to learn the
most important facts about the Leibniz hierarchy and of abstract
algebraic logic in general. </p>

<p>
The relations between the classes of the Leibniz hierarchy considered
in this entry are summarized in the following diagram:</p>

<div class="figure">
<img alt="A diagram of four levels level 1: 'finitely algebraizable' with arrows pointing to level 2 objects: 'finitely equivalential' and 'algebraizable'; both of these have arrows pointing to level 3 object 'equivalential' and the latter also has an arrow pointing to level 3 object 'weakly algebraizable' both level 3 objects have arrows to level 4 object: 'protoalgebraic' and the second also points to 'truth-equational'" src="leibniz-hierarchy.svg" />

<span class="figlabel"><br/>Figure.</span> The Leibniz Hierarchy</p>
</div>

<p>
Recently, the Leibniz hierarchy has been refined in Cintula &amp;
Noguera 2010, 2016. The idea is to consider instead of a set of
equivalence formulas \(\Delta\) (that corresponds to the biconditional)
a set of formulas \([p\Rightarrow q]\) that has several properties of the
usual conditional \((\rightarrow)\). Among these properties we have \((\tR_{\Rightarrow})\) and
\((\tMP_{\Rightarrow})\) in the definition of protoalgebraic logic. The set \([p\Rightarrow q]\) should be such that its symetrization \([p\Rightarrow q]
\cup[q\Rightarrow p]\) is a set of equivalence formulas. New classes
arise when the set \([p\Rightarrow q]\) has a single element.
Extensive information can be found in the recent book Cintula &amp;
Noguera 2021. This book can also be taken as an introduction to
abstract algebraic logic written from the perspective of the
implication. </p>

<h2 id="ReplPrin">11. Replacement principles</h2>

<p>
Two classes of logics that are not classes of the Leibniz hierarchy
have been extensively studied in abstract algebraic logic. They are
defined from a completely different perspective from the one provided
by the behavior of the Leibniz operator, namely from the perspective
given by the replacement principles a logic might enjoy.</p>

<p>
The strongest replacement principle that a logic system \(\bL\) might
have, shared for example by classical logic, intuitionistic logic and
all its axiomatic extensions, says that for any set of formulas
\(\Gamma\), any formulas \(\phi , \psi , \delta\) and any variable \(p\)</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
if \(\Gamma , \phi \vdash_{\bL } \psi\) and \(\Gamma , \psi
\vdash_{\bL } \phi\), then \(\Gamma , \delta(p/\phi) \vdash_{\bL }
\delta(p/\psi)\) and \(\Gamma , \delta(p/\psi) \vdash_{\bL }
\delta(p/\phi)\),</p>
</div>

<p>
where \(\delta(p/\phi)\) and \(\delta(p/\psi)\) are the formulas
obtained by substituting respectively \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) for \(p\)
in \(\delta\). This replacement property is taken by
some authors as the formal counterpart of Frege&rsquo;s principle of
compositionality for truth. Logics satisfying this strong replacement
property are called <em>Fregean</em> in Font &amp; Jansana 1996 and
are thoroughly studied in Czelakowski &amp; Pigozzi 2004a, 2004b.</p>

<p>
Many important logics do not satisfy the strong replacement property,
for instance almost all the logics (local or global) of the modal
family, but some, like the local consequence relation of a normal
modal logic, satisfy a weaker replacement principle: for all formulas
\(\phi , \psi , \delta\),</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
if \(\phi \vdash_{\bL }\psi\) and \(\psi \vdash_{\bL }\phi\), then
\(\delta(p/\phi) \vdash_{\bL } \delta(p/\psi)\) and \(\delta(p/\psi)
\vdash_{\bL } \delta(p/\phi)\).</p>
</div>

<p>
A logic satisfying this weaker replacement property is called
<em>selfextensional</em> by W&oacute;jcicki (e.g., in W&oacute;jcicki
1969, 1988) and <em>congruential</em> in Humberstone 2005. We will use
the first terminology because it seems more common &mdash;at least in
the abstract algebraic logic literature. It has to be mentioned that
all fragments of a selfextensional logic are selfextensional and that
the analogous fact also holds for Fregean logics. Moreover, the difference
between being selfextensional and being Fregean is not only
encountered among protoalgebraic logics like the mentioned local
consequence relations of normal modal logics, it is also encountered
among non protoalgebraic logics. The four-valued logic of Belnap and
Dunn (see Font 1997 for information) is selfextensional,
non-protoalgebraic, and non-Fregean.</p>

<p>
Selfextensional logics have a very good behavior from several points
of view. Their systematic study started in W&oacute;jcicki 1969 and
has  been continued in the context of abstract algebraic logic
in Font &amp; Jansana 1996; Jansana 2005, 2006; and Jansana &amp;
Palmigiano 2006.</p>

<p>
There are selfextensional and non-selfextensional logics in any one of
the classes of the Leibniz hierarchy and also in the class of
non-protoalgebraic logics. These facts show that the perspective that
leads to the consideration of the classes in the Leibniz hierarchy and
the perspective that leads to the definition of the selfextensional
and the Fregean logics as classes of logics worthy of study as a whole
are to a large extent different. Nonetheless, one of the trends of
today&rsquo;s research in abstract algebraic logic is to determine the
interplay between the two perspectives and study the classes of logics
that arise when crossing both classifications. In fact, there is a
connection between the replacement principles and the Suszko
congruence (and thus with the Leibniz congruence). A logic \(\bL\)
satisfies the strong replacement principle if and only if for every
\(\bL\)-theory \(T\) its Suszko congruence is the
interderivability relation relative to \(T\), namely
the relation \(\{\langle \phi , \psi \rangle : T, \phi \vdash_{\bL }
\psi\) and \(T, \psi \vdash_{\bL } \phi \}\). And a logic \(\bL\)
satisfies the weak replacement principle if and only if the Suszko
congruence of the set of theorems of \(\bL\) is the interderivability
relation \(\{\langle \phi , \psi \rangle : \phi \vdash_{\bL } \psi\)
and \(\psi \vdash_{\bL } \phi \}\).</p>

<p>
The study of logic systems from the perspective of the replacement
principles lead to the so called Frege hierarchy we expound in Section

<p>
Not all interesting logics are protoalgebraic. In this section we will
briefly discuss four examples of non-protoalgebraic logics: the logic
of conjunction and disjunction, positive modal logic, the strict
implication fragment of \(\blK\) and Visser&rsquo;s subintuitionistic
logic. All of them are selfextensional. In the next section, we will
expound the semantics of abstract logics and generalized matrices that
serves to develop a really general theory of the algebraization of
logic systems. As we will see, the perspective changes in an important
respect from the perspective taken in logical matrix model theory.</p>

<h3 id="LogiConjDisj">12.1 The logic of conjunction and disjunction</h3>

<p>
This logic is the \(\{\wedge , \vee , \bot , \top \}\)-fragment of
Classical Propositional Logic. Hence its language is the set
\(\{\wedge , \vee , \top , \bot \}\) and its consequence relation is
given by</p> 

\[\Gamma \vdash \phi\txtiff\Gamma \vdash_{\bCPL} \phi.\]

<p>
It turns out that it is also the \(\{\wedge , \vee , \bot , \top
\}\)-fragment of Intuitionistic Propositional Logic. Let us denote it
by \(\bL^{\{\wedge , \vee \}}\).</p>

<p>
The logic \(\bL^{ \{\wedge , \vee \}}\) is not protoalgebraic but it
is Fregean. The class of algebras \(\bAlg\bL^{\{\wedge , \vee \}}\) is
the variety of bounded distributive lattices, which is the class of
algebras naturally expected to be the associated with \(\bL^{ \{\wedge
, \vee \}}\), but the class \(\bAlg^*\bL^{ \{\wedge , \vee \}}\) is
strictly included in it. In fact, this last class of algebras is not a
quasivariety, but still it is good enough to be first-order
definable.</p>

<p>
The logic \(\bL^{\{\wedge , \vee \}}\) is thus a natural example of a
logic where the class of algebras of its reduced matrix models is not
the right class of algebras expected to correspond to it (see Font
&amp; Verd&uacute; 1991 where the logic is studied at length). The
properties of this example and its treatment in Font &amp;
Verd&uacute; 1991 motivated the systematic study in Font &amp; Jansana
1996 of the kind of models for sentential logics considered in Brown
&amp; Suszko 1973, namely, abstract logics.</p>

<h3 id="PosiModaLogi">12.2 Positive Modal Logic</h3>

<p>
Positive Modal Logic is the \(\{\wedge , \vee , \Box , \Diamond , \bot
, \top \}\)-fragment of the local normal modal logic \(\blK\). We
denote it by \(\bPML\). This logic has some interest in Computer
Science.</p>

<p>
The logic \(\bPML\) is not protoalgebraic, it is not truth-equational,
it is selfextensional and it is not Fregean. Its algebraic counterpart
\(\bAlg \bPML\) is the class of positive modal algebras introduced by
Dunn in Dunn 1995. The logic is studied in Jansana 2002 from the
perspective of abstract algebraic logic. The class of algebras
\(\bAlg\bPML\) is different from \(\bAlg^*\bPML\).</p>

<h3 id="VissSubiLogi">12.3 Visser&rsquo;s subintuitionistic logic</h3>

<p>
This logic is the logic in the language of intuitionistic logic that
has to the least normal modal logic \(K\) the same
relation that intuitionistic logic has to the normal modal logic
\(S4\). It was introduced in Visser 1981 (under the name Basic
Propositional Logic) and has been studied by several authors, such as
Ardeshir, Alizadeh, and Ruitenburg. It is not protoalgebraic, it is
truth-equational and it is Fregean (hence also selfextensional).</p>

<h3 id="StriImplFragLocaModaLogiLK">12.4 The strict implication fragment of the local modal logic <strong>lK</strong></h3>

<p>
The strict implication of the language of modal logic is defined using
the \(\Box\) operator and the material implication \(\rightarrow\). We
will use \(\Rightarrow\) for the strict implication. Its definition is
\(\phi \Rightarrow \psi := \Box(\phi \rightarrow \psi)\). The language
of the logic \(\bSilK\), that we call the strict implication fragment
of the local modal logic \(\blK\), is the language \(L = \{\wedge ,
\vee , \bot , \top , \Rightarrow \}\). We can translate the formulas
of \(L\) to formulas of the modal language by
systematically replacing in an \(L\)-formula \(\phi\)
every subformula of the form \(\psi \Rightarrow \delta\) by
\(\Box(\psi \rightarrow \delta)\) and repeating the process until no
appearance of \(\Rightarrow\) is left. Let us denote by \(\phi^*\) the
translation of \(\phi\) and by \(\Gamma^*\) the set of the
translations of the formulas in \(\Gamma\). Then the definition of the
consequence relation of \(\bSilK\) is:</p> 

\[\Gamma \vdash_{\bSilK } \phi\txtiff\Gamma^* \vdash_{\blK } \phi^*.\]

<p>
The logic \(\bSilK\) is not protoalgebraic and is not
truth-equational. It is selfextensional but it is not Fregean. Its
algebraic counterpart \(\bAlg \bSilK\) is the class of bounded
distributive lattices with a binary operation with the properties of
the strict implication of \(\blK\). This class of algebras is
introduced and studied in Celani &amp; Jansana 2005, where its members
are called Weakly Heyting algebras. \(\bAlg \bSilK\) does not coincide
with \(\bAlg^* \bSilK\).</p>

<p>
The logic \(\bSilK\) belongs, as Visser&rsquo;s logic, to the family
of so-called subintuitionistic logics. A reference to look at for
information on these logics is Celani &amp; Jansana 2003.</p>

<p>
The reader can find more information on interesting non-protoalgebaric
logics in Albuquerque et alt. 2017. </p>

<h2 id="AbstLogiGeneMatr">13. Abstract logics and generalized matrices</h2>

<p>
The logical matrix models of a given logic can be thought of as
algebraic generalizations of its theories, more precisely, of its
Lindenbaum matrices. They come from taking a local perspective
centered around the theories of the logic considered one by one and
its analogs the logic filters (also taken one by one). But, as we will
see, the properties of a logic depend in general on the global
behavior of the set of its theories taken together as a bunch; or
&mdash;to put it otherwise&mdash; on its consequence relation. The
consideration of this global behavior introduces a global perspective
on the design of semantics for logic systems. The abstract logics that
we are going to define can be seen, in contrast to logical matrices,
as algebraic generalizations of the logic itself and its extensions.
They are the natural objects to consider when one takes the global
perspective seriously.</p>

<p>
Let \(L\) be a propositional language. An \(L\)-<em>abstract
logic</em> is a pair \(\cA = \langle
\bA\), C \(\rangle\) where \(\bA\) is an \(L\)-algebra
and \(C\) an abstract consequence operation on \(A\).</p>

<p>
Given a logic system \(\bL\), an \(L\)-abstract logic
\(\cA = \langle \bA, C \rangle\) is a <em>model</em> of \(\bL\) if for
every set of formulas \(\Gamma\) and every formula \(\phi\)</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\Gamma \vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff\) for every valuation \(v\)
on \(\bA, \bv(\phi) \in C(\bv[\Gamma])\).</p>
</div>

<p>
This definition has an equivalent in terms of the closed sets of \(C\):
an abstract logic \(\cA = \langle \bA, C \rangle\)
is a model of \(\bL\) if and only if for every \(C\)-closed
set \(X\) the matrix \(\langle
\bA, X \rangle\) is a model of \(\bL\) (i.e., \(X\) is
an \(\bL\)-filter).</p>

<p>
This observation leads to another point of view on abstract logics as
models of a logic system. It transforms them into a collection of
logical matrices (given by the closed sets) over the same algebra, or,
to put it more simply, into a pair \(\langle \bA, \cB \rangle\) where
\(\cB\) is a collection of subsets of \(A\). A
structure of this type is called in the literature a <em>generalized
matrix</em> (W&oacute;jcicki 1973) and more recently it has been
called an <em>atlas</em> in Dunn &amp; Hardegree 2001. It is said to
be a model of a logic system \(\bL\) if for every \(X \in \cB, \langle
\bA, X \rangle\) is a matrix model of \(\bL\).</p>

<p>
A logic system \(\bL = \langle L, \vdash_{\bL } \rangle\)
straightforwardly provides us with an equivalent abstract logic
\(\langle \bFm_L, C_{\vdash_{ \bL} } \rangle\) and an equivalent
generalized matrix \(\langle \bFm_L,\tTH(\bL) \rangle\), where
\(\tTH(\bL)\) is the set of \(C_{\vdash_{ \bL}}\)-closed sets of
formulas (i.e., the \(\bL\)-theories). We will move freely from one to
the other.</p>

<p>
The generalized matrices \(\langle \bA, \cB \rangle\) that correspond
to abstract logics have the following two properties: \(A \in \cB\)
and \(\cB\) is closed under intersections of arbitrary nonempty
families. A family \(\cB\) of subsets of a set \(A\)
with these two properties is known as a <em>closed-set system</em> and
also as a <em>closure system</em>. There is a dual correspondence
between abstract consequence operations on a set \(A\)
and closed-set systems on \(A\). Given an abstract
consequence operation \(C\) on \(A\),
the set \(\cC_C\) of \(C\)-closed sets is a closed-set
system and given a closed-set system \(\cC\) the operation \(C_{\cC}\)
defined by \(C_{\cC }(X) = \bigcap \{Y \in \cC: X \subseteq Y\}\), for
every \(X \subseteq A\), is an abstract consequence operation. In
general, every generalized matrix \(\langle \bA, \cB \rangle\) can be
turned into a closed-set system by adding to \(\cB \cup \{A\}\) the
intersections of arbitrary nonempty subfamilies, and therefore into an
abstract logic, which we denote by \(\langle \bA, C_{\cB }\rangle\).
In that situation we say that \(\cB\) is a <em>base</em> for
\(C_{\cB}\). It is obvious that an abstract logic can have more than
one base. Any family of closed sets with the property that every
closed set is an intersection of elements of the family is a base. The
study of bases for the closed set system of the theories of a logic
usually plays an important role in its study. For example, in
classical logic an important base for the family of its theories is
the family of maximal consistent theories and in intuitionistic logic
the family of prime theories. In a similar way, the systematic study
of bases for generalized matrix models of a logic becomes
important.</p>

<p>
In order to make the exposition smooth we will now move from abstract
logics to generalized matrices. Let \(\cA = \langle \bA, \cB \rangle\)
be a generalized matrix. There exists the greatest congruence of
\(\bA\) compatible with all the sets in \(\cB\); it is known as the
<em>Tarski congruence</em> of \(\cA\). We denote it by
\(\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB)\) and has the following characterization
using the Leibniz operator</p> 

\[\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB) = \bigcap_{X \in \cB} \bOmega_{\bA }(X).\]

<p>
It can also be characterized by the condition:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\langle a, b \rangle \in \bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB)\txtiff\) for
every \(\phi(p, q_1 , \ldots ,q_n)\), every \(c_1 , \ldots ,c_n \in
A\) and all \(X \in \cB\)</p>
</div> 

\[\phi^{\bA }[a, c_1 , \ldots ,c_n] \in X \Leftrightarrow \phi^{\bA }[b, c_1 , \ldots ,c_n] \in X\]

<p>
or equivalently by</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\langle a, b \rangle \in \bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB)\txtiff\) for
every \(\phi(p, q_1 , \ldots ,q_n)\) and every \(c_1 , \ldots ,c_n \in
A, C_{\cB }(\phi^{\bA }[a, c_1 , \ldots ,c_n]) = C_{\cB }(\phi^{\bA
}[b, c_1 , \ldots ,c_n])\).</p>
</div>

<p>
A generalized matrix is <em>reduced</em> if its Tarski congruence is
the identity. Every generalized matrix \(\langle \bA, \cB \rangle\)
can be turned into an equivalent reduced one by identifying the
elements related by its Tarski congruence. The result is the quotient
generalized matrix \(\langle \bA / \bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB),
\cB/\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB) \rangle\), where
\(\cB/\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB) = \{X/\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA }(\cB): X
\in \cB\}\) and for \(X \in \cB\), the set \(X/\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA
}(\cB)\) is that of the equivalence classes of the elements of \(X\).</p>

<p>
The properties of a logic \(\bL\) depend in general, as we already
said, on the global behavior of the family of its theories. In some
logics, this behavior is reflected in the behavior of its set of
theorems, as in classical and intuitionistic logic due to the
deduction-detachment property, but this is by no means the most
general situation, as it is witnessed by the example of the local and
global modal logics of the normal modal logic \(K\).
The two have the same theorems but do not share the same properties.
Recall that the local logic has the deduction-detachment property but
the global one does not. In a similar way, the properties of a logic
are <em>in general</em> better encoded in an algebraic setting if we
consider families of \(\bL\)-filters on the algebras than if we
consider a single \(\bL\)-filter as it is done in logical matrices
model theory.</p>

<p>
The generalized matrix models that have naturally attracted most of
the attention in the research on the algebraization of logics are the
generalized matrices of the form \(\langle \bA, \tFi_{\bL }\bA
\rangle\) where \(\tFi_{\bL }\bA\) is the set of all the
\(\bL\)-filters of \(\bA\). An example of a property of logics encoded
in the structure of the lattices of \(\bL\)-filters of the \(L\)-algebras
is that for every finitary protoalgebraic
logic \(\bL, \bL\) has the deduction-detachment property if and only
if for every algebra \(\bA\) the join-subsemilattice of the lattice of
all \(\bL\)-filters of \(\bA\) that consists of the finitely generated
\(\bL\)-filters is dually residuated; see Czelakowski 2001.</p>

<p>
The generalized matrices of the form \(\langle \bA, \tFi_{\bL }\bA
\rangle\) are called the <em>basic full g-models</em> of \(\bL\) (the
letter &lsquo;g&rsquo; stands for generalized matrix). The interest in
these models lead to the consideration of the class of generalized
matrix models of a logic \(\bL\) with the property that their quotient
by their Tarski congruence is a basic full g-model. These generalized
matrices (and their corresponding abstract logics) are called <em>full
g-models</em>. The theory of the full g-models of an arbitrary logic
is developed in Font &amp; Jansana 1996, where the notions of full
g-model and basic full g-model are introduced. We will mention some of
the main results obtained there.</p>

<p>
Let \(\bL\) be a logic system.</p>

<ol>

<li id="sys1">\(\bL\) is protoalgebraic if and only if for every full
g-model \(\langle \bA, \cC \rangle\) there exists an \(\bL\)-filter
\(F\) of \(\bA\) such that \(\cC = \{G \in \tFi_{\bL
}\bA: F \subseteq G\}\).</li>

<li id="sys2">If \(\bL\) is finitary, \(\bL\) is finitely
algebraizable if and only if for every algebra \(\bA\) and every
\(\bL\)-filter \(F\) of \(\bA\), the generalized matrix
\(\langle \bA, \{G \in \tFi_{\bL }\bA: F \subseteq G\} \rangle\) is a
full g-model and \(\bAlg\bL\) is a quasivariety.</li>

<li id="sys3">The class \(\bAlg\bL\) is both the class of algebras of
the reduced generalized matrix models of \(\bL\) and the class
\(\{\bA: \langle \bA, \tFi_{\bL }\bA \rangle\) is reduced\(\}\).</li>

<li id="sys4">For every algebra \(\bA\) there is an isomorphism
between the family of closed-set systems \(\cC\) on \(A\)
such that \(\langle\bA, \cC\rangle\) is a full
g-model of \(\bL\) and the family of congruences \(\theta\) of \(\bA\)
such that \(\bA/\theta \in \bAlg\bL\). The isomorphism is given by the
Tarski operator that sends a generalized matrix to its Tarski
congruence.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The isomorphism
 <a href="#theorem4">theorem (4)</a>
 above is a generalization of the isomorphism theorems we encountered
earlier for algebraizable logics. What is interesting here is that the
theorem holds for every logic system. Using
 <a href="#sys2">(2)</a>
 above,
 <a href="#theorem4">theorem (4)</a>
 entails the isomorphism theorem for finitary and finitely
algebraizable logics. Thus
 <a href="#theorem4">theorem (4)</a>
 can be seen as the most general formulation of the mathematical
logical phenomena that underlies the isomorphism theorems between the
congruences of the algebras in a certain class and some kind of
subsets of them we mentioned in
 <a href="#WhenLogiAlgeWhatDoesMean">Section 9</a>.</p>
 
<p>
The use of generalized matrices and abstract logics as models for
logic systems has proved very useful for the study of selfextensional
logics in general and more in particular for the study of the
selfextensional logics that are not protoalgebraic such as the logics
discussed in
 <a href="#BeyoProtLogi">Section 12</a>.
 In particular, they have proved very useful for the study of the
class of finitary selfextensional logics with a conjunction and the
class of finitary selfextensional logics with the deduction-detachment
property for a single term, say \(p \rightarrow q\); the logics in
this last class are nevertheless protoalgebraic. A logic \(\bL\) has a
<em>conjunction</em> if there is a formula in two variables \(\phi(p,
q)\) such that</p> 

\[\phi(p, q) \vdash_{\bL } p,\;\;\; \phi(p, q)\vdash_{\bL } q, \;\;\; p, q \vdash_{\bL } \phi(p, q).\]

<p>
The logics in those two classes have the following property: the
Tarski relation of every full g-model \(\langle \bA, C \rangle\) is
\(\{\langle a, b \rangle \in A \times A: C(a) = C(b)\}\). A way of
saying it is to say that for these logics the property that defines
selfextensionality, namely that the interderivability condition is a
congruence, lifts or transfers to every full g-model. The
selfextensional logics with this property are called <em>fully
selfextensional</em>. This notion was introduced in Font &amp; Jansana
1996 under the name &lsquo;strongly selfextensional&rsquo;. All the
natural selfextensional logics considered up to 1996 are fully
selfextensional, in particular the logics discussed in
 <a href="#BeyoProtLogi">Section 12</a>,
 but Babyonyshev showed (Babyonyshev 2003) an <em>ad hoc</em> example
of a selfextensional logic that is not fully selfextensional. A much
more natural example discovered later of a selfextensional logic that
is not fully selfextensional is the fragment of only the negation and
the constant \(\top\) of classical logic. </p>

<p>
An interesting result on the finitary logics which are fully
selfextensional logics with a conjunction or with the
deduction-detachment property for a single term is that their class of
algebras \(\bAlg\bL\) is always a variety. It looks surprising that many
finitary and finitely algebraizable logics have a variety as its
equivalent algebraic semantics, when the theory of algebraizable
logics allows in general to prove only that the equivalent algebraic
semantics of a finitary and finitely algebraizable logic is a
quasivariety. The result explains this phenomenon for the finitary and
finitely algebraizable logics to which it applies. For many other
finitary and finitely algebraizable logics to find a convincing
explanation is still an open area of research.</p> 

<p>
Every abstract logic \(\cA = \langle \bA, C \rangle\) determines a
quasi-order (a reflexive and transitive relation) on \(A\). It is the
relation defined by \[a \le_{\cA } b\txtiff C(b) \subseteq C(a)\txtiff
b \in C(a).\]</p>

<p>
Thus, \(a \le_{\cA } b\) if and only if \(b\) belongs to every
\(C\)-closed set to which \(A\) belongs. For a fully selfextensional
logic \(\bL\), this quasi-order turns into a partial order in the
reduced full g-models, which are in fact the reduced basic full
g-models, namely, the abstract logics \(\langle \bA, \tFi_{\bL }\bA
\rangle\) with \(\bA \in \bAlg\bL\). Consequently, in a fully
selfextensional logic \(\bL\) every algebra \(\bA \in \bAlg\bL\)
carries a partial order definable in terms of the family of the
\(\bL\)-filters. If the logic is fully selfextensional with a
conjunction this partial order is definable by an equation of the
\(L\)-algebraic language because in this case for every algebra \(\bA
\in \bAlg\bL\) we have: \[a \le b\txtiff C(b) \subseteq C(a)\txtiff
C(a \wedge^{\bA } b) = C(a)\txtiff a \wedge^{\bA } b = a,\] where
\(C\) is the abstract consequence operation that corresponds to the
closed-set system \(\tFi_{\bL }\bA\), and \(\wedge^{\bA}\) is the
operation defined on \(\bA\) by the formula that is a conjunction for
the logic \(\bL\).</p>

<p>
A similar situation holds for fully selfextensional logics with the
deduction-detachment property for a single term, say \(p \rightarrow
q\), for then for every algebra \(\bA \in \bAlg\bL\)</p> 

\[a \le b\txtiff C(b) \subseteq C(a)\txtiff C(a \rightarrow^{\bA } b) = C(\varnothing) = C(a \rightarrow^{\bA } a) \txtiff \\ a \rightarrow^{\bA } b = a \rightarrow^{\bA } a.\]

<p>
These observations lead us to view the finitary fully selfextensional
logics \(\bL\) with a conjunction and those with the
deduction-detachment property for a single term as logics definable by
an order which is definable in the algebras in \(\bAlg\bL\) by using
an equation of the \(\bL\)-algebraic language. Related to this, the
following result is known.</p>

<div class="indent">
<strong>Theorem 8.</strong>
<br />
A finitary logic \(\bL\) with a conjunction is fully selfextensional
if and only if there is a class of algebras \(\bK\) such that for
every \(\bA \in \bK\) the reduct \(\langle A, \wedge^{\bA }\rangle\)
is a meet-semilattice and if \(\le\) is the order of the semilattice,
then

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\phi_1 , \ldots ,\phi_n\vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff\) for all \(\bA \in
\bK\) and every valuation \(v\) on \(\bA \; \bv(\phi_1)
\wedge^{\bA }\ldots \wedge^{\bA } \bv(\phi_n) \le \bv(\phi)\)</p>
</div>

<p>
and</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(\vdash_{\bL } \phi\txtiff\) for all \(\bA \in \bK\) and every
valuation \(v\) on \(\bA \; a \le \bv(\phi)\), for
every \(a \in A\).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Moreover, in this case the class of algebras \(\bAlg\bL\) is the
variety generated by \(\bK\).</p>

<p>
Similar results can be obtained for the selfextensional logics with
the deduction-detachment property for a single term. The reader is
referred to Jansana 2006 for a study of the selfextensional logics
with conjunction, and to Jansana 2005 for a study of the
selfextensional logics with the deduction-detachment property for a
single term.</p>

<p>
The class of selfextensional logics with a conjunction includes the
so-called logics preserving degrees of truth studied in the fields of
substructural logics and of many-valued logics. The reader can look at
Bou et al. 2009 and the references therein. </p>

<h2 id="FregeHier">14. The Frege hierarchy</h2>

<p>
A hierarchy of logic systems grounded on the replacement principles
discussed in
 <a href="#FregeHier">Section 11</a>
 instead of on the behaviour of the Leibniz congruences is also
considered in abstract algebraic logic. It is known as the <em>Frege
hierarchy</em>. Its classes are those of selfextensional logics, fully
selfextensional logics, Fregean logics and the class of fully Fregean
logics that we define now. </p>

<p>
In the same way as the fully selfextensional logics are the
selfextensional logic systems that enjoy the property that in every one
of their full g-models the abstract version of the characteristic
property defining selfextensionally holds, the fully Fregean logics are
the Fregean logics that in every one of their full g-models  the abstract
version of the characteristic property defining being Fregean holds.
The next can be taken as the best understandable definition.</p>

<p>
A logic system \(\bL\) is <em>fully Fregean</em> when in every one of
its basic full g-models \(\langle \bA, \tFi_{\bL }\bA \rangle\), for
every \(F \in \tFi_{\bL }\bA\), the Suszko congruence
\({\bOmega^{\sim}_{\bA}}^{\bL}(F)\) coincides with the relation of
belonging to the same elements of \(\tFi_{\bL }\bA\) that extend
\(F\). It is easy to see that the fully Fregean logics are Fregean and
that they are fully selfextensional. </p>

<p>
Examples of fully Fregean logics are classical and intuitionistic
logic an also the logic of conjunction and disjunction discussed in
12.1. The fragment of just the negation and a constant for true of
classical logic mentioned before is a Fregean logic that is not fully
Fregean. </p>

<p>
We address the reader to Chapter 7 of Font 2016a for an introduction
to the main facts of the Frege hierarchy and for examples of logic
systems in the families of the Frege hierarchy. A discussion of the
Frege and Leibniz hierarchies related to assertional logics can be
found in Albuquerque et al. 2018 where also several examples of logic
systems are discussed and classified.</p>

<h2 id="ExteSett">15. Extending the setting</h2>

<p>
The research on logic systems described in the previous sections has
been extended to encompass other consequence relations that go beyond
propositional logics, like equational logics and the consequence
relations between sequents built from the formulas of a propositional
language definable using sequent calculi. The interested reader can
consult the excellent paper Raftery 2006a.</p>

<p>
This research arose the need for an even more abstract way of
developing the theory of consequence relations. It has lead to a
reformulation (in a category-theoretic setting) of the theory of logic
systems as explained in this entry. The work has been done mainly by
G. Voutsadakis in a series of papers, e.g., Voutsadakis 2002.
Voutsadakis&rsquo;s approach uses the notion of a pi-institution,
introduced by Fiadeiro and Sernadas, as the analog of the logic
systems in his category-theoretic setting. Some work in this direction
is also found in Gil-F&eacute;rez 2006. A different approach to a
generalization of the studies encompassing the work done for logic
systems and for sequent calculi is found in Galatos &amp; Tsinakis
2009; Gil-F&eacute;rez 2011 is also in this line. The work presented
in these two papers originates in Blok &amp; J&oacute;nsson 2006. The
Galatos-Tsinakis approach has been recently extended in a way that
also encompasses the setting of Voutsadakis in Galatos &amp;

<p>
Another recent line of research that extends the framework described
in this entry develops a theory of algebraization of many-sorted logic
systems using instead of the equational consequence relation of the
natural class of algebras a many-sorted behavioral equational
consequence (a notion coming from computer science) and a weaker
concept than algebraizable logic: behaviorally algebraizable logic.

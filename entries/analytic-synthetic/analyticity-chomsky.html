<h3>1. Background</h3>

<p>
This supplement to the entry on the analytic-synthetic distinction
will not set out in any detail Noam Chomsky&rsquo;s important
proposals about the nature of human
 language.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-19" id="ref-19">19</a>]</sup>
 Whether or not one ultimately agrees with those proposals, there can
be no doubt that they have been tremendously influential in
linguistics, philosophy and in cognitive science generally (a
discipline that his work partly initiated). For anyone doubtful of
their relevance to philosophy, it is enough to simply note how
frequently philosophers before him, such as Ayer (1934 [1952]) and
Wittgenstein (1953, [1967]), appealed to a notion of
&ldquo;grammar&rdquo; that is entirely ungrounded in the kind of
detailed empirical research that Chomsky and others have assiduously
pursued for some seventy years. This supplement will be concerned only
with ways in which Chomskyan proposals have recast and deepened our
understanding of what an account of the analytic might involve.</p>

<p>
The main aim of a Chomskyan linguistics is to explain the remarkable
fact that virtually all human beings automatically acquire a natural
language that enables them to understand a potential infinity of novel
sentences. Chomsky&rsquo;s approach to this issue has its roots in
much of the Fregean and Positivist traditions that were reviewed in
the main entry. He was a student in the 1940s of the formal linguist,
Zellig Harris who recommended he study with the philosopher, Nelson
Goodman, who was then teaching seminars on the manuscript that would
become his <em>The Structure of Appearance</em> (Goodman, 1951
[1977]). This was a formidable work in which Goodman employed the then
still fairly novel techniques of &ldquo;logical construction&rdquo;
developed by the Positivists (especially Carnap (1928 [1967]) to
derive the structure of experience from a sensory base (see ASD,
&sect;1.2ff). Although Chomsky was likely already inclined to formal
approaches, the elegance and formal precision of both Harris&rsquo;
and Goodman&rsquo;s work became and has remained an ideal throughout
the many developments of his views.</p>

<p>
Chomsky regards this human linguistic ability to be the result of a
largely innate sensitivity to the elaborate structures of natural
language, which he argued that the methods of 1940s (so-called)
&ldquo;structuralism&rdquo; and behaviorism in linguistics were
inadequate to describe. The logical techniques he learned from Harris
and Goodman (as well from the work of the logician, Emil Post, 1936)
seemed to him far more promising for setting out the &ldquo;generative
syntax&rdquo; of a language, or the recursive system for combining
symbols in ways that give rise to those structures. They also promised
to do so in ways independent of any controversial
&ldquo;semantics,&rdquo; or complex relations of the symbols to ideas
or phenomena in the world. Just how independent the syntax of a
natural language is from its &ldquo;semantics&rdquo; has been the
topic of continuing controversy, some of it involving the issue of
analyticity about which Chomsky has vacillated in important ways that
will be discussed below.</p>

<p>
An important feature of Chomsky&rsquo;s work has been its focus on
data that are immediately available to most any native speaker of a
natural language, but which were by and large little noticed until
Chomsky called attention to them. They generally consist of pairs of
very similar sentence-like strings of words, one of which is perfectly
acceptable, and the other clearly not (marked by &ldquo;*&rdquo;). To
cite some simple examples: virtually all English speakers would balk
at such strings as</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>(1)</dt>
<dd>*<em>Who did John and kiss Mary?</em> (cf. <em>John and
<strong>who</strong> kissed Mary?</em>).</dd>
<dt>(2)</dt>
<dd>*<em>Who did stories about terrify Mary?</em> (cf. <em>Stories
about <strong>who</strong> terrified Mary?</em>)</dd>
<dt>(3)</dt>
<dd>*<em>She&rsquo;s as likely as he&rsquo;s to get ill</em> (cf.
<em>She is as likely as <strong>he is</strong> to get ill</em>)</dd>
<dt>(4)</dt>
<dd>*<em>I recommended the Brie without tasting</em> (cf. <em>Which
cheese did you recommend without
 tasting?</em>)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-20" id="ref-20">20</a>]</sup></dd>
 </dl>

<p>
Much of Chomskyan linguistics has been devoted to determining the
surprisingly complex principles needed to account for a virtual
infinity of such examples.</p>

<h3>2. Semantic Features</h3>

<p>
(1)&ndash;(4) exhibit the kind of grammatical, or <em>syntactic</em>
data that has most concerned Chomsky, the acceptability of certain
strings of English words largely without regard to their meaning, or
<em>semantics</em>. But Chomsky was not uninterested in
 semantics,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-21" id="ref-21">21</a>]</sup>
 and, often endorses the analytic-synthetic distinction:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If the best argument for dispensing with the analytic &ndash;
synthetic distinction is that it is of no use to the field linguist,
then virtually everyone who actually works in descriptive semantics,
or ever has, must be seriously in error, since such work is shot
through with assumptions about connections of meaning, which will (in
particular) induce examples of the analytic-synthetic distinction.
(2000, p. 47; see also pp. 34&ndash;35; 61&ndash;65)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A particular issue that is implicit in Chomsky&rsquo;s discussion of
language is an issue of <em>semantic productivity</em> that was
crucial to Frege:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the possibility of our <em>understanding</em> sentences which we have
never heard before rests evidently on this, that we can construct the
sense of a sentence out of parts that correspond to words. (Frege, c.
1914 [1979]: 79; emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This semantic productivity is made possible by what has come to be
called the <em>compositionality</em> (q.v.) of language, which Frege
famously captured on the model of mathematical functions, whereby the
semantic value of a complex expression is a function of the semantic
values of its parts. To take a familiar example, the truth of
&ldquo;Snow is white and grass is black&rdquo; is a truth-function of
the truth values of its parts (in this case, it would obviously be
false, given that one constituent is false).</p>

<p>
In an (at the time) influential attempt to combine the Fregean insight
with Chomsky&rsquo;s then nascent syntactic program, Jerry Fodor and
Jerry Katz (1963) also stressed that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The fact that a speaker can <em>understand</em> any sentence must mean
that the way he <em>understands</em> sentences which he has never
previously encountered is compositional: on the basis of his knowledge
of the grammatical properties and the meanings of the morphemes of the
language, the rules which the speaker knows enables him to determine
the meaning of a novel sentence in terms of the manner in which the
parts of the sentence are composed form the whole. (Fodor and Katz,
1963, p. 171, emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
To capture the semantic aspects of &ldquo;understanding,&rdquo; Fodor
and Katz proposed that, in addition to markers for grammatical
categories, there are also &ldquo;semantic markers&rdquo; that
provide</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the means by which we can decompose the meaning of one sense of a
lexical item into its atomic concepts, and thus exhibit the semantic
structure IN a dictionary entry and the semantic relations BETWEEN
dictionary entries. (p185, emphasis orig.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
They provide as an example an analysis of the several meanings of
&ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; in terms of markers for <em>animal</em> (for
young, unmated seals) and <em>human</em>, the latter bifurcating into
<em>person with lowest academic degree</em> and <em>male</em>, which
further divides into <em>unmarried</em> and <em>young knight</em>
(p186). A semantic theory would provide such systems of markers for
presumably a wide swath of expressions in natural languages.
Generally:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Grammatical markers mark the formal differences on which the
distinction between well-formed and ill-formed strings of morphemes
rests, while semantic markers give each well-formed string the
conceptual content that permits it to be a means of genuine verbal
communication. (p.210)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Katz and Postal, 1964, pursued similar proposals.) Extending the
scope of such a program, Katz (1972) further enlarged on the analytic
data (ASD, &sect;1) and drew attention to speakers&rsquo; agreements
about, e.g., synonymy, redundancy, antonymy, and implication. And, to
be sure, at least some examples of such semantic data seem as striking
and needing of explanation as purely syntactic
 cases.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-22" id="ref-22">22</a>]</sup>
 Since, as we have seen (ASD, &sect;3.7), the explanations of analytic
data offered by Quine, Putnam and (later) Fodor seem empirically
inadequate, perhaps the best explanation of this data is to be had in
terms of semantics markers.</p>

<p>
As we&rsquo;ll see in &sect;5, Chomsky vacillated in his views of the
analytic. In his (1965), however, he came to share these interests of
Fodor and Katz (1963), and included in the purview of linguistic
theory at least some clearly semantic phenomena:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is clear, as Katz and Fodor have emphasized, that the meaning of a
sentence is based on the meaning of its elementary parts and the
manner of their combination. &hellip; [T]here are cases that suggest
the need for an even more abstract notion of grammatical function and
grammatical relation than any that has been developed so far, in any
systematic way. Consider, for example, these sentence pairs:</p>
</blockquote>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(19)</dt>
<dd>

<dl class="sentag tag2em">
<dt>(i)</dt>
<dd><em>John strikes me as pompous &ndash; I regard John as
pompous.</em></dd>
<dt>(ii)</dt>
<dd><em>I liked the play &ndash; the play pleased me</em>.
&hellip;</dd>
</dl></dd>
</dl>

<blockquote>

<p>
Clearly. there is a meaning relation, approaching a variety of
paraphrase, in these cases. &hellip; It seems that beyond the notions
of surface structure (such as &ldquo;grammatical subject&rdquo;) and
deep structure (such a &ldquo;logical subject&rdquo;), there is still
some more abstract notion of &ldquo;semantic function&rdquo; still
unexplained. (1965, pp.161&ndash;3)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Chomsky (1965) regarded Fodor and Katz&rsquo;s semantic markers as
giving rise to &ldquo;selectional rules&rdquo; that supplement more
purely syntactic &ldquo;subcategorization rules,&rdquo; and claimed
that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Failure to observe a selectional rule will produce such examples
as:</p>
</blockquote>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(20)</dt>
<dd>#<em>Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.</em></dd>
<dt>(21)</dt>
<dd>#<em>Golf plays John</em></dd>
<dt>(22)</dt>
<dd>#<em>Misery loves company</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
which he (1965, p. 149) regards as &ldquo;deviant&rdquo; (n.b., (22)
can&rsquo;t be literal, misery being inanimate). Such examples are now
usually marked with a &ldquo;#&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;*&rdquo; to
indicate semantic/pragmatic rather than purely syntactic anomaly.</p>

<p>
Chomsky mentions other examples of the sort that were treated as
analytic data in ASD &sect;1:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(23)</dt>
<dd>#<em>Oculists are generally better trained than
eye-doctors</em>.</dd>
<dt>(24)</dt>
<dd>#<em>Both of John&rsquo;s parents are married to aunts of
 mine.</em><sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-17" id="ref-17">17</a>]</sup></dd>
 <dt>(25)</dt>
<dd>#<em>I knew you would come, but I was wrong.</em> (1965, p.
77)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
But he also cites as an example one that many philosophers might
actually find more purely syntactic:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(26)</dt>
<dd><em>Mary expects to feed herself; so Mary expects to feed
Mary</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
claiming that this is &ldquo;analytic, with the three occurrences of
Mary taken to be coreferential&rdquo; (2000, p.
 47).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-23" id="ref-23">23</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
And he sometimes treats as <em>syntactic</em>, features of words that
might initially seem semantic:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
features such as [Human], [+Abstract] &hellip; play a role in the
functioning of the syntactic component, no matter how narrowly syntax
is conceived. (1965, p151).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such cases are presumably like the linguistic treatments of
&ldquo;gender,&rdquo; which are&nbsp;largely distinct from the
biological distinction (thus, in Spanish, the noun for the
moon&nbsp;&ndash;<em>La Luna</em>&ndash; is feminine,&nbsp; while in
German it &ndash;<em>Der Mond</em>&ndash;<em>&nbsp;</em>is masculine,
and the girl&nbsp;&ndash;<em>Das M&auml;dchen</em>&ndash;neuter; see
Corbett, 1991, &sect;7.3, for further such divergencies.&nbsp;Similar
divergencies are observed&nbsp;in the case of &ldquo;animacy&rdquo;;
see, e.g.,&nbsp; Trompenaars et al, 2021).&nbsp;Just which
&ldquo;semantic&rdquo; features are in this way assimilated into the
syntax is not always entirely clear, but it presumably has to do with
the presence of some more purely syntactic effect, as in examples
Chomsky discusses in the same passage:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(27)</dt>
<dd>*<em>A very walking/hitting person appeared.</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
vs.</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(28)</dt>
<dd><em>A very frightening/amusing person appeared</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
where the gerund adjective seems to involve a selection rule requiring
[+abstract] (see &sect;4 below for more such mixed semantic/syntactic
examples).</p>

<p>
Chomsky (2000, p32) stresses that verbs, with their relational
structure, are richer sources of semantic data than the nouns that
philosophers tend to
 discuss,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-24" id="ref-24">24</a>]</sup>
 and he frequently discusses the (supposed) inferential connection
between <em>persuade</em> and <em>intend</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It seems reasonable to suppose that semantic relations between words
like &ldquo;persuade,&rdquo; &ldquo;intend,&rdquo;
&ldquo;believe,&rdquo; can be expressed in purely linguistic terms
(namely: if I persuade you to go, then you intend to go. (Chomsky
1977, p. 142; see also 1980a, p. 62; 2000, pp. 62ff,176ff)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He sometimes even presses surprisingly strong views about
philosophically controversial cases. Contrary to much of the trend of
many materialists who advocate computational theories of mental
processes, Chomsky (2000) notes with approval Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
claim</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he question whether machines think cannot seriously be posed:
&ldquo;We can only say of a human being and what is like one that it
thinks&rdquo; (Wittgenstein [1953 [1967], &sect;360)], maybe dolls and
spirits; that is the way the tool is used. (2000, p. 44)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Cf. also Wittgenstein, 1953 [1967], &sect;281, although it&rsquo;s
worth wondering whether Wittgenstein &ndash; or Chomsky! &ndash;
really intended to be making claims merely about features of
<em>lexical entries</em> on a par, per above, with a claim about
linguistic gender; see ASD, &sect;5 for further discussion of this
example.)</p>

<p>
In any case, Chomsky early on makes an important claim that would seem
to support the traditional philosophical interest in the analytic:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he syntactic component contains a lexicon, and...each lexical item
is specified in the lexicon in terms of its <em>intrinsic semantic
features</em>, whatever these may be. (1965, p. 198fn11, italics
mine)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, knowing the meaning of a term would seem to entail that one
appreciates what &ldquo;intrinsic semantic features&rdquo; are
specified in its lexical entry. However, understanding exactly the
role such semantic features actually play requires a further important
distinction.</p>

<h3>3. I- vs. E-languages</h3>

<p>
Crucial to Chomsky&rsquo;s views is a distinction he draws (1965,
&sect;1.1) between &ldquo;competence&rdquo; and
&ldquo;performance,&rdquo; or speakers&rsquo; <em>ability to
understand</em> (or reject) a potential infinitude of examples vs.
their <em>actual use</em> of words in speech. He sharpens this
distinction in his (1986, pp. 20&ndash;2) by distinguishing what he
regards as essentially the ordinary, folk notion of external, what he
calls &ldquo;E-languages,&rdquo; such as English, Mandarin, Swahili,
ASL and other languages that are commonly taken to be spoken or signed
by various social groups, vs. what he regards as the theoretically
more interesting notion of an internal &ldquo;I-language.&rdquo; This
is not a &ldquo;language&rdquo; that is spoken at all, but is an
internal, largely innate <em>computational system</em> in the brain
(or a stable final-state of that system) that is responsible for a
speaker&rsquo;s linguistic
 competence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-25" id="ref-25">25</a>]</sup>
 Chomsky (2000, pp. 16&ndash;40) argues that E-languages are too
ill-defined by vague, pragmatic and changing social boundaries and
conventions to serve as a theoretically interesting category (but see
Ringa and Eska, 2013, for evidence nevertheless of their scientific
viability). Whether or not his views prove ultimately correct, it is
worth pursuing them as an explanatory avenue that could conceivably
provide an empirically principled basis for the analytic.</p>

<p>
This distinction between I- and E-languages dovetails nicely with
recent, independent philosophical attention on the complex interplay
between syntax, semantics and pragmatics in ordinary conversation,
particularly in the phenomenon of &ldquo;polysemy.&rdquo; This is the
use of a word that retains its single &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; despite
being used to indicate different, conflicting referents or
truth-conditions sometimes in a single sentence. For example, <em>The
bank</em> is being understood polysemously in</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(29)</dt>
<dd><em>The bank was destroyed by fire and so moved across the
street.</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
The sentence is perfectly acceptable despite the switch in intended
reference: what was destroyed was <em>a building</em> but what moved
across the street was <em>a financial institution</em>. It stands in
contrast to</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(30)</dt>
<dd>#<em>The bank was eroding fast and so raised its interest
rates.</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
where such a switch between the alluvial and financial senses would
involve clear ambiguity, or homonymy (Chomsky, 2000, pp.
180&ndash;1).</p>

<p>
A particularly interesting and, for proponents of the analytic,
troublesome related phenomenon is what the philosopher Frederick
Waismann (1945) called &ldquo;open texture,&rdquo; or the serious
possibility of using old terms in new ways to accommodate previously
unanticipated cases. Simon Blackburn (1996) provides a timely example
of the term &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; whose</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
open texture is revealed if, through technological advance,
differences open up between the mother that produces the ovum, the
mother that carries the foetus to term, and the mother that rears the
baby. It will then be fruitless to pursue the question of which is the
&lsquo;real&rsquo; mother, since the term is not adapted to giving a
decision in the new circumstances. (Blackburn
 1996)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-26" id="ref-26">26</a>]</sup></p>
 </blockquote>

<p>
For Chomsky, phenomena of polysemy and open-texture underwrite an
important claim he advances:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We cannot assume that statements (let alone sentences) have truth
conditions. At most they have something more complex: &ldquo;truth
indications&rdquo; in some sense. There is good evidence that words
have intrinsic properties of sound, form, and meaning; but also open
texture, which allows their meanings to be extended and sharpened in
certain ways. (Chomsky 1996, p. 52)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He (2000: 36&ndash;52, 188) points out that this proposal is a way of
fleshing out Peter Strawson&rsquo;s (1950) claim that it is not
<em>words</em> but <em>people</em> that refer by <em>using words</em>.
The items that are true or false are not sentences by themselves, but
<em>statements</em> made on specific occasions in specific
contexts.</p>

<p>
Indeed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A lexical item provides us with a certain range of perspectives for
viewing what we take to be the things in the world, or what we
conceive in other ways; these items are like filters or lenses,
providing ways of looking at things and thinking about the products of
our minds. &hellip; Referring to London, we can be talking about a
location or area, people who sometimes live there, the air above it
(but not too high), buildings, institutions, etc., in various
combinations (as in London is so unhappy, ugly, and polluted that it
should be destroyed and rebuilt 100 miles away, still being the same
city). (2000, p. 36)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These &ldquo;perspectives&rdquo; are provided by what he, Robyn
Carston (2002, 2012) and Paul Pietroski (2005, 2018) have variously
called &ldquo;indicators,&rdquo; or &ldquo;pointers&rdquo; to
concepts, or sets of concepts in &ldquo;regions of conceptual
space,&rdquo; which contain various kinds of information out of which
a speaker can make a selection in using the I-language structures to
express a truth-conditional content in a particular
 context:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-27" id="ref-27">27</a>]</sup>
 that is, truth-conditions are a matter of <em>performance</em> not
<em>competence</em>. As Sperber and Wilson (1986/95) and many others
have stressed, ordinary communication is often driven by a concern to
be <em>relevant</em>, saying all that is needed as efficiently as
possible for the purposes at hand. To this end, speakers may delete
material provided by the I-language, and exploit gestures, intonation,
social conventions, and contextual and background information to
understand the truth-conditions in ways that go well beyond what
I-language structures provide.</p>

<p>
Given the richness of the resources available to speakers, they
certainly needn&rsquo;t be slave to the particular constraints of
their I-language. Indeed, they often aren&rsquo;t, as when, for
example, English speakers omit subjects and auxiliaries that (they
know full well) their (I-)language requires, asking, e.g., <em>Finish
your thesis?</em> or <em>Been to New York lately?</em>; or when
determiners and auxiliaries are omitted in headlines (<em>President
shot!</em>) or public signs (<em>No vehicles allowed in
 park</em>);<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-28" id="ref-28">28</a>]</sup>
 or when logicians introduce formalisms, or chemists notations like
&ldquo;H2O,&rdquo; whose syntax may be quite different from that of
any natural language (cf., Chomsky, 2000, pp. 42&ndash;43). A speaker
selects those features of an I-language structure that are appropriate
for the context in which a specific utterance is being produced, and
ignores those that aren&rsquo;t. What the I-language provides might be
regarded as <em>defaults</em>: the structures and features of lexical
items are normally respected, but may be overridden for any number of
good reasons, such as cogency, efficiency or the development of
scientific theory. Like ethical precepts against, for example, lying
and killing, they are <em>prima facie</em> or default presumptions
that can be overridden by other considerations (soldiers killing in
war can still appreciate that killing is wrong). Thus one can override
syntactic principles and produce tokens of <em>President shot!</em>,
as well as of (22), <em>Misery loves company</em>, knowing but
over-riding the [&ndash;abstract] selection restriction on
<em>loves.</em></p>

<p>
Such a view would seem to offer the possibility of an ecumenical
resolution of some of the disputes we discussed in ASD
(&sect;&sect;3.4, 3.7) between Putnam (1962 [1975]) and Katz
(1990:pp216ff) about whether <em>Cats are animals</em> is analytic or
could be refuted by discovering the things are robots. They might
<em>both</em> be right: <em>Cats are animals</em> might be analytic
insofar as [+animal] is indeed part of the I-language item pronounced
&ldquo;cats,&rdquo; but tokens of it may nevertheless be false as a
matter of use in the light of surprising scientific discoveries.
Similarly, in the Canadian dispute over whether <em>gay marriage</em>
is a contradiction (ASD&sect;3.7), Chomsky (1965, p77) might be right
in his claim about (26), #<em>Both of John&rsquo;s parents are married
to aunts of mine,&nbsp;</em>being anomalous (at least in 1965), while
the court could be right about how the term should be used legally, a
case of &ldquo;open texture&rdquo; not unlike the case of
&ldquo;mother&rdquo; mentioned by Blackburn above. And logical
constants such as <em>and</em> and <em>or</em> may have certain
classical inferential roles specified in their entries which are
nonetheless sometimes not respected, either because of expressive
efficiency or of over-riding theory (cf., ASD, fn 9). (So the
definition of &ldquo;analytic&rdquo; would have to be qualified: p is
analytic iff p could be known by virtue of knowing the meanings of its
constituent words, <em>unless it is false</em>. Thus, someone could
know something is analytic in this sense despite not believing it to
be true.)</p>

<p>
Polysemous use of language might also go some way towards explaining a
persistent puzzle about the analytic: why some claims seem analytic
despite the persistent failure/impossibility of providing successful
analyses (cf. Fodor, 1981, 1998), and why the best we seem to be able
to find are what Wittgenstein (1953 {1967, &sect;&sect;66&ndash;67)
called &ldquo;family resemblances&rdquo; between different uses of a
 word:<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup>
 there may be nothing in common between all uses of a univocal
word.</p>

<p>
But does anything go? The trouble with Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
&ldquo;family resemblances&rdquo; and Waismann&rsquo;s &ldquo;open
texture&rdquo; is that they seem totally unconstrained.
<em>Everything</em>, after all, resembles <em>everything else</em> in
<em>some</em> respect or other (any two things are co-members of an
infinite number of sets), and so a term could be extended in virtually
<em>any</em> way at all. There must be <em>some</em> constraints on
meaning if people are to acquire their competence not only to
understand acceptable strings, but to come to think and to communicate
with each other in the remarkably rich and stable ways they manifestly
do, despite familiar failures. As Fodor and Lepore (1998 [2002])
observe &ldquo;Surely there just couldn&rsquo;t be a word that&rsquo;s
polysemous between lamb-the-animal and (say) beef-the-meat? Or between
lamb-the-animal and succotash-the-mixed-vegetable?&rdquo; (p.
117).</p>

<h3>4. Persisting Explanatory Burdens</h3>

<p>
All this pushes the question back to how to justify the identification
of specific semantic constraints as part of the identity of a lexical
item. This it has not proven easy to do. Fodor (1970, 1981) contested
on linguistic grounds some of the most prized examples of
analyticities, such as #(8) in set II (ASD, &sect;1), <em>If Holmes
killed Sikes, then Sikes is dead</em> (although see Pietroski, 2002,
for a reply). And Fodor, J.D. <em>et al.</em> (1975) raised doubts
about whether any kind of &ldquo;semantic decomposition&rdquo; of
lexical items into &ldquo;basic&rdquo; semantic features is
psychologically real &ndash; indeed, whether there is a
psychologically principled basis for determining the features into
which they might be decomposed: given the failure of traditional
empiricist efforts to reduce concepts to sensory experience (see ASD,
&sect;&sect;2&ndash;3), it&rsquo;s unlikely the basic features would
be <em>perceptual</em> (see Fodor, 1981; 1998, p. 44).</p>

<p>
However, it&rsquo;s important to distinguish here, as Fodor, J.D.
<em>et al</em>, 1980, and many psycholinguists don&rsquo;t always do,
between decomposition as a <em>performance</em> issue, reflected, say,
in response times to presented sentences, from it as an issue of
linguistic <em>competence</em>, which might not always in reflected in
performance (cf., McCourt, 2021). One might access a lexical item in a
variety of ways more efficient than consulting its definition. For
example, Jackendoff (1992) and others have called attention to the
heavy use of spatial metaphors in many grammatical constructions. But
such facts don&rsquo;t entail that the concepts of the domains to
which these metaphors are applied &ndash; say, the structure of the
mind, social relations, or mathematics &ndash; are, themselves,
somehow intrinsically spatial, or really thought by anyone to be so.
People may find it useful to conceive of many domains in spatial ways.
However, <em>conceptions</em> &ndash;common beliefs, family
resemblances, prototypes, memories of exemplars &ndash; are one thing,
people&rsquo;s <em>concepts</em> and the <em>meanings of their
words</em> quite another. Two mathematicians can have the thought that
<em>there is no largest prime</em>, even if one of them thinks of
numbers spatially and the other purely algebraically (see Rey, 1985).
Moreover, as Fodor and LePore (1998 [2002]) repeatedly stress
(following Frege, see &sect;2 above), it&rsquo;s essential to concepts
and word meaning that they are compositional, the meaning of a
syntactic combination being in general a function of the meaning of
its parts, and this, prototypes and images fail to be (<em>pet
fish</em> is not composable from prototypes or images of <em>pet</em>
and <em>fish</em>).</p>

<p>
But even if we restrict attention to competence, one must still ask
Quine&rsquo;s question: how we are to distinguish an analytic claim
from simply a tenacious worldly belief? When he&rsquo;s sympathetic to
the analytic (which, as will be evident shortly, he not always is),
Chomsky claims, for example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It has been argued plausibly that concepts of a locational nature
&ndash; including goal and source of action, object moved, etc.
&ndash; enter widely into lexical structure, often in quite abstract
ways. In addition, notions like actor, recipient of action,
instrument, event, intention, causation and others are pervasive
elements of lexical structure, with their specific properties and
interrelations. (Chomsky 2000, p. 62).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And he (2000, pp. 128, 183, 204fn14) endorses work of Julius Moravcsik
(1975, 1990) and James Pusteyovsky (1995) on the role of such
Aristotelian categories in natural language semantics.</p>

<p>
Aristotelian categories may well have a place; but one needs to be
careful. Pusteyovsky (1995, 2002) offers a rich theory of &ldquo;the
generative lexicon,&rdquo; whereby lexical items have
&ldquo;argument,&rdquo; &ldquo;event,&rdquo; &ldquo;qualia&rdquo; and
&ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; structures, each of which &ldquo;contributes
a different kind of information to the meaning of a word&rdquo;
(p419). Now, the first two, argument and event structures, have been
independently proposed as parts of syntactic theory (see Pietroski,
2018), but it is hard to see how the second two, qualia and
inheritance structures, are separable from merely common beliefs about
the phenomena in the world words pick out (cf. ASD, &sect;3.6C).
Pusteyovsky, for example, writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the qualia structure of a word specifies four aspects of its
meaning:</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>

<li>the relation between it and its constituent parts;</li>

<li>that which distinguishes it within a larger domain (its physical
characteristics);</li>

<li>its purpose and function;</li>

<li>whatever brings it about. (2002, p. 418)</li>
</ul>

<p>
and the</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Inheritance Structure [specifies] How the word is globally related to
other concepts in the lexicon. (2002, p. 419)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But the purposes and functions of things, and the relations they bear
to their parts and to other things, as well as issues of, e.g.,
intention and causation, are a large part of simply what constitutes a
person&rsquo;s mere beliefs about the world, which, as Putnam (1965
[1975]) rightly observed (ASD, &sect;3.4A), are frequently revised in
the light of evolving theories without apparent changes in the
meanings of words. Speakers perfectly competent with the word
&ldquo;music&rdquo; may be ignorant of or revise their ideas about its
constituent parts (instruments, counterpoint, harmonic structure), its
purpose and function (amusement, edification, the glory of god), as
well as about how on earth musicians manage to produce it (or perhaps
it&rsquo;s just naturally occurring &ldquo;music of the
spheres!&rdquo;). And many speakers may understand natural phenomena
as artifacts, as when they regard the world as the creation of God,
and earthquakes as expressions of His wrath. As Jerry Fodor (1987)
pointed out:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
People can have radically false theories and really crazy views,
consonant with our understanding perfectly well, thank you, which
false views they have and what radically crazy things it is they
actually believe. Berkeley thought that chairs are mental, for
heaven&rsquo;s sake! Which are we to say he lacked, the concept MENTAL
or the concept CHAIR? (1987, p. 125)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(See Fodor and Lepore, 1998 [2002], for related objections, and
Pusteyovsky, 1998, for a reply).</p>

<p>
Specific proposals of a recent linguistics text about the semantic
structure of some English words make the problem particularly vivid.
Laurel Brinton (2000) writes, for example, that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Trot &ndash; requires [+QUADRUPED] subject
<br />
{The horse, *the money, *the spider} trotted home</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>
Fly &ndash; requires [+WINGED] subject
<br />
{The airplane, the bird, *the goat} flew north</p>

<p>
Admire &ndash; requires [+HUMAN] subject
<br />
{Judy, *the goldfish} admires Mozart (Brinton 2000, p. 154)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Set aside the straightforward empirical inadequacies of the proposals
(don&rsquo;t missiles and balls fly through the air without wings?).
Even if they matched speakers&rsquo; intuitions, there would still be
the issue of their significance. It would, of course, be certainly
surprising to encounter trotting spiders, flying goats, and goldfish
admiring Mozart, but it&rsquo;s hard to see why we should conclude
that our surprise is due to <em>constraints of the I-language</em>
rather than merely to <em>commonplace beliefs</em> about spiders,
goats and goldfish. Perhaps there are meaning constraints in the
vicinity of these examples (<em>trots</em> requires legs,
<em>admire</em> a mental agent), but the challenge is to provide a
principled basis for insisting upon specific
 ones.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
These examples point to a still further serious problem of determining
just what, if anything, it is specifically about the I-language that
presents difficulties for violations of semantic constraints. Are such
worldly features as [+quadruped], [+winged] or (returning to standard
examples of <em>bachelor</em> and <em>pediatrican</em>)
[&ndash;married] and [+doctor] really included in lexical items
processed by the I-language? Notice that the analytic data certainly
don&rsquo;t present quite the same immediate difficulties in
processing that are presented by syntactic ones:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(31)</dt>
<dd>#<em>Some bachelor is married</em>,</dd>
<dt>(32)</dt>
<dd> #<em>No one who runs moves</em>,</dd>
</dl>

<p>
or denials that <em>ancestor</em> is transitive or<em> marriage</em>
symmetric (see ASD, &sect;1), seem to be perfectly <em>parsable</em>,
in contrast to:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(33)</dt>
<dd>*<em>Who did John and kiss Mary</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
and</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(34)</dt>
<dd>*<em>She&rsquo;s as likely as he&rsquo;s to get ill.</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Indeed, for starters, what are in fact (non-formally) contradictory
sentences, e.g.,</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(35)</dt>
<dd><em>There is a finite number of primes</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
often appear as premises in perfectly intelligible <em>reductio ad
absurdum</em> proofs that show they are! And philosophers often quite
intelligently dispute proposed analyses of, e.g., <em>cause</em> and
<em>know</em>, as well as supposed &ldquo;category mistakes&rdquo;
that many have claimed are involved in claiming, e.g., that reasons
are causes, or sensations events in the brain.</p>

<p>
Lastly, unlike syntactically unacceptable cases, mere semantic
anomalies can be perfectly well embedded in other phrases: thus,</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(36)</dt>
<dd><em>Sue denied that some bachelor is married.</em></dd>
<dt>(37)</dt>
<dd><em>John was amused by the thought that the number three likes
Tabasco sauce.</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
are perfectly acceptable, unlike</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(38)</dt>
<dd>*<em>Sue wondered who did John and kiss Mary.</em></dd>
<dt>(39)</dt>
<dd>*<em>John asked who stories about frightened Ann.</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
So it&rsquo;s not clear that the I-language so much as <em>cares</em>
about mere semantic anomalies. Perhaps they really aren&rsquo;t
phenomena of <em>language</em> at all, but rather features of our
conceptual and/or belief systems, the (unembedded) sentences being
simply silly and false &ndash;precisely as Quine (1960 [2013[, p. 210)
proposed.</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s worth contrasting these cases with semantic cases that the
I-language <em>does</em> seem to care about. These don&rsquo;t seem to
be abundant &ndash;we mentioned a few earlier in discussing
(29)&ndash;(30) (&sect;2 above)&ndash; but one striking set of
examples are &ldquo;negative polarity&rdquo; items (&ldquo;NPI&rdquo;s),
such as <em>ever</em> and <em>at all</em>, which can only appear in
certain, e.g., &ldquo;negative&rdquo;
 contexts.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup>
 Thus:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(40)</dt>
<dd><em>Sue doubts Tom has ever flown.</em></dd>
<dt>(41)</dt>
<dd><em>Sue doesn&rsquo;t like pistachios at all</em>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
are fine, but not:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(42)</dt>
<dd>*<em>Sue knows Tom has ever flown.</em></dd>
<dt>(43)</dt>
<dd>*<em>Sue likes pistachios at all.</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Here the semantic features seem to have a kind of syntactic reflex,
prohibiting material that, in contrast to mere &ldquo;category
mistakes,&rdquo; <em>cannot</em> in general be acceptably
embedded:</p>

<dl class="sentag tag2em indent">
<dt>(44)</dt>
<dd>*<em>John thinks Sue knows he has ever flown.</em></dd>
<dt>(45)</dt>
<dd>*<em>It is widely believed that Sue likes pistachios at
all.</em></dd>
</dl>

<p>
So here we have what would seem to be some serious linguistic evidence
for the reality of what seems to be a semantic
 phenomenon.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup>
 Until we find analogous data that show some such syntactic reflexes
to category mistakes and other of the analytic data, it&rsquo;s going
to be hard to claim that these latter &ldquo;analytic&rdquo; cases are
due to some genuine property of the <em>language system</em>, as
opposed to merely something about our belief systems, in the way
Quinean sceptics suspect (cf. ASD, &sect;3.5) &ndash; and, as we will
now see, as <em>sometimes</em> Chomsky himself does!</p>

<h3>5. Chomsky&rsquo;s Doubts and Retreats</h3>

<p>
Chomsky vacillates a great deal about the analytic. Passages quoted so
far seem decidedly sympathetic to it, but interwoven throughout those
passages are more Quinean reservations, that (given the earlier
passages) are so surprising and significant that they need to be
quoted at length. What is particularly distinctive and important about
his vacillations is that, unlike the traditional philosophical
reactions that he sometimes shares, Chomsky sees the issues not as
ones involving merely intuitions and behavioral dispositions, but of
ascertaining their <em>aetiologies</em> in what he suspects is a
subtle and complex, but still not well-understood internal
organization of speakers&rsquo; minds.</p>

<p>
He (1965) early on recognizes the difficulty of distinguishing
semantic from syntactic phenomena:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A decision as to the boundary separating syntax and semantics (if
there is one) is not a prerequisite for theoretical and descriptive
study of syntactic and semantic rules. On the contrary, the problem of
delimitation will clearly remain open until these fields are much
better understood than they are today. <em>Exactly the same can be
said about the boundary separating semantic systems from systems of
knowledge and belief. That these seem to interpenetrate in obscure
ways has long been noted.</em> (1965, p.159; added emphasis)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, it isn&rsquo;t at all clear that semantic phenomena should be
included in the language faculty at all:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Do the &ldquo;semantic rules&rdquo; of natural language that are
alleged to give the meanings of words belong to the language faculty
strictly speaking, or should they be regarded perhaps as centrally
embedded parts of a conceptual or belief system, or do they subdivide
in some way? (1980a, p. 62)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Addressing some of the examples that were discussed in ASD, &sect;3,
he continues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Much of the debate about these matters has been inconclusive. It turns
on dubious intuitions as to whether we would still call our pets
&ldquo;cats&rdquo; if we learned that they are robots controlled by
Martians, or whether we would call the stuff in the Ganges
&ldquo;water&rdquo; were we to discover that it differs in chemical
composition from what flows in the Mississippi&hellip;. (1980a, p.
62)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And, recalling his own examples of <em>persuade/intend,
chase/follow</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[Q]uite generally, arguments for analytic connections of some sort
involving properties of the verbal system, with its network of
thematic relations, are more compelling than those devised for common
nouns. Even assuming there to be certain analytic connections, as I
believe to be the case, the question remains whether these are to be
assigned to the language faculty, hence to appear in some form in its
representations of meaning, <em>or to a conceptual system</em>.
(1980a, p. 62; emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This last passage seems to raise an interesting possibility of a
&ldquo;conceptual&rdquo; system <em>distinct</em> from <em>both</em>
the language faculty and a general belief confirmation system, along
lines many traditional philosophers might find congenial (cf. the talk
in &sect;2 of lexical items containing not the semantic features
themselves, but merely &ldquo;pointers to (sets of) concepts in
conceptual space&rdquo;). But, of course, such a possibility would
need to be spelt out empirically, and the prospects aren&rsquo;t clear
(see Harman 1994 [1999] for <em>prima facie</em> difficulties).</p>

<p>
Sometimes, moreover, Chomsky seems to capitulate almost entirely to
Quine:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Much of what is often regarded as central to the study of meaning
cannot be dissociated from systems of belief in any natural way.
(Chomsky 1975, p. 23)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
With regard to &ldquo;meaning holism&rdquo; [Quine] may well turn out
to be correct, at least in large part. (2000, p. 61; cf., ASD,
&sect;3.4fn13)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, despite all of Chomsky&rsquo;s
vacillations, the really&nbsp;important point to bear in mind&nbsp;is
his <em>methodological&nbsp;</em>one:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The status of a statement as a truth of meaning or of empirical fact
can only be established by empirical inquiry, and considerations of
many sorts may well be relevant; for example, inquiry
into&nbsp;language acquisition and variation among languages. The
question of the existence of analytic truths and semantic connections
more generally is an empirical one, to be settled by inquiry that goes
well beyond the range of evidence ordinarily brought to bear in the
literature on these topics. (2000, pp. 63&ndash;64)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He provides as an example his (1980b) dispute with Harman (1980) over
the &ldquo;persuade&rdquo;/&ldquo;intend&rdquo;
 connection,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup>
 writing:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose that two people differ in their intuitive judgments as to
whether I can persuade John to go to college without his deciding or
intending to do so (see Harman 1980). We are by no means at an
impasse. Rather, we can construct conflicting theories and proceed to
test them. (2000, p. 64)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Specifically, along lines he himself pursues:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One who holds that the connection between <em>persuade</em> and
<em>decide</em> or <em>intend</em> is conceptual will proceed to
elaborate the structure of the concepts, their primitive elements, the
principles by which they are integrated and related to other cognitive
systems, and so on; and will seek to show that other properties of
language and other aspects of the acquisition and use of language can
be explained in terms of the very same assumptions about the innate
structure of the language faculty, in the same language and others,
and that the same concepts play a role in other aspects of thought and
understanding. (2000, p. 64)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the other hand:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One who holds that the connection is one of deeply held belief, not
connection of meaning, has the task of developing a general theory of
belief fixation that will yield the right conclusions in these and
numerous other cases. (2000, p. 64)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What with the phenomenon of &ldquo;confirmation holism&rdquo; that was
discussed in ASD, &sect;3.4, a general theory of belief fixation looks
to be far more difficult than philosophers have traditionally
supposed. Chomsky is likely sympathetic to Fodor&rsquo;s (2000)
pessimism in this regard, and so, unsurprisingly, concludes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The first tack &ndash;in terms of innate conceptual structure &ndash;
seems far more promising to me, and is the only approach that has any
results or even proposals to its credit; it is, however, a matter of
empirical inquiry, not pronouncements on the basis of virtually no
evidence. (2000, p. 64; see also p. 129)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Perhaps the best expression of Chomsky&rsquo;s ultimate view of
semantics and the analytic is one he stated early on:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The syntactic and semantic structure of natural languages evidently
offers many mysteries, both of fact and principle, and that any
attempt to delimit the boundaries of these domains must certainly be
quite tentative. (1965, p. 163)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>6. Conclusion</h3>

<p>
Chomsky&rsquo;s program offers a welcome invitation to explore the
aetiologies of judgments regarding the analytic data much more deeply
in the internal structure of the mind than did traditional appeals
merely to intuitions and behavioral dispositions; but it remains to be
seen whether in the end the aetiologies can ultimately ground the
analytic-synthetic distinction any better than they did. Perhaps a
linguistic distinction is not what is wanted, but rather some
independent theory of <em>concepts</em> that might better do the work
many 20th-Century philosophers hoped the analytic would perform (cf.
ASD &sect;2), and is arguably the sort of investigation many
philosophers have really had in mind. But here it is reasonable to
regard the verdict as still out, the theoretical understanding of our
understanding of language, concepts and the mind being a much subtler
topic of on-going empirical research than many philosophers have
traditionally supposed.</p>

<p>
Turing machines, first described by <a href="../turing/index.html">Alan Turing</a>
in Turing 1936&ndash;7, are simple abstract computational devices
intended to help investigate the extent and limitations of what can be
computed. Turing&rsquo;s &lsquo;automatic machines&rsquo;, as he
termed them in 1936, were specifically devised for the computing of
real numbers. They were first named &lsquo;Turing machines&rsquo; by
Alonzo Church in a review of Turing&rsquo;s paper (Church 1937).
Today, they are considered to be one of the foundational models of
computability and (theoretical) computer 
science.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup></p>

<h2 id="DefiTuriMach">1. Definitions of the Turing Machine</h2>

<h3 id="TuriDefi">1.1 Turing&rsquo;s Definition</h3>

<p>
Turing introduced Turing machines in the context of research into the
foundations of mathematics. More particularly, he used these abstract
devices to prove that there is no effective general method or
procedure to solve, calculate or compute every instance of the
following problem:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong><em>Entscheidungsproblem</em></strong> The problem to decide
for every statement in first-order logic (the so-called restricted
functional calculus, see the entry on
 <a href="../logic-classical/index.html">classical logic</a>
 for an introduction) whether or not it is derivable in that
logic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that in its original form (Hilbert &amp; Ackermann 1928), the
problem was stated in terms of validity rather than derivability.
Given G&ouml;del&rsquo;s completeness theorem (G&ouml;del 1929)
proving that there is an effective procedure (or not) for derivability
is also a solution to the problem in its validity form. In order to
tackle this problem, one needs a formalized notion of &ldquo;effective
procedure&rdquo; and Turing&rsquo;s machines were intended to do
exactly that.</p>

<p>
A Turing machine then, or a <em>computing machine</em> as Turing
called it, in Turing&rsquo;s original definition is a machine capable
of a finite set of configurations \(q_{1},\ldots,q_{n}\) (the
states of the machine, called <i>m</i>-configurations by Turing). It
is supplied with a one-way infinite and one-dimensional tape divided
into squares each capable of carrying exactly one symbol. At any
moment, the machine is scanning the content of <em>one</em> square
<i>r</i> which is either blank (symbolized by \(S_0\)) or contains a
symbol \(S_{1},\ldots ,S_{m}\) with \(S_1 = 0\) and \(S_2 =
1\).</p>

<p>
The machine is an automatic machine (<i>a</i>-machine) which means
that at any given moment, the behavior of the machine is completely
determined by the current state and symbol (called the
<em>configuration</em>) being scanned. This is the so-called
<em>determinacy condition</em>
 (<a href="#ThesDefiAxioTheo">Section 3</a>).
 These <i>a</i>-machines are contrasted with the so-called choice
machines for which the next state depends on the decision of an
external device or operator (Turing 1936&ndash;7: 232). A Turing
machine is capable of three types of action:</p>

<ol>

<li>Print \(S_i\), move one square to the left (<i>L</i>) and go to
state \(q_{j}\)</li>

<li>Print \(S_i\), move one square to the right (<i>R</i>) and go to
state \(q_{j}\)</li>

<li>Print \(S_i\), do not move (<i>N</i>) and go to state
\(q_{j}\)</li>
</ol>

<p>
The &lsquo;program&rsquo; of a Turing machine can then be written as a
finite set of quintuples of the form: </p> 

\[q_{i}S_{j}S_{i,j}M_{i,j}q_{i,j}\]

<p>
Where \(q_i\) is the current state, \(S_j\) the content of the square
being scanned, \(S_{i,j}\) the new content of the square; \(M_{i,j}\)
specifies whether the machine is to move one square to the left, to
the right or to remain at the same square, and \(q_{i,j}\) is the next
state of the machine. These quintuples are also called the transition
rules of a given machine. The Turing machine \(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\)
which, when started from a blank tape, computes the sequence
\(S_0S_1S_0S_1\ldots\) is then given by
 <a href="#Quint_Simple">Table 1</a>.</p>
 

<div class="figure" id="Quint_Simple">

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Table 1:</span> Quintuple representation of
\(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\)</p> 

\[
\begin{align}\hline
;q_{1}S_{0}S_{0}Rq_{2}\\
;q_{1}S_{1}S_{0}Rq_{2}\\
;q_{2}S_{0}S_{1}Rq_{1}\\
;q_{2}S_{1}S_{1}Rq_{1}\\\hline
\end{align}
\]

</div>

<p>
Note that \(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\) will never enter a configuration
where it is scanning \(S_1\) so that two of the four quintuples are
redundant. Another typical format to represent Turing machines and
which was also used by Turing is the <em>transition table</em>.
 <a href="#Table_Simple">Table 2</a>
 gives the transition table of \(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\).</p>

<div class="figure" id="Table_Simple">

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Table 2:</span> Transition table for
\(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\)</p>

<table class="two-rules cellpad-med-dense nocaption cell-center">

  <td>\(S_0\)</td>
  <td>\(S_1\)</td> </tr>

  <td>\(S_{0}\opR q_{2}\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(q_2\)</td>
  <td>\(S_{1}\opR q_{1}\)</td>
  <td>\(S_{1}\opR q_{1}\)</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>
Where current definitions of Turing machines usually have only one
type of symbols (usually just 0 and 1; it was proven by Shannon that
any Turing machine can be reduced to a binary Turing machine (Shannon
1956)) Turing, in his original definition of so-called <em>computing
machines</em>, used two kinds of symbols: the <em>figures</em> which
consist entirely of 0s and 1s and the so-called <em>symbols of the
second kind</em>. These are differentiated on the Turing machine tape
by using a system of alternating squares of figures and symbols of the
second kind. One sequence of alternating squares contains the figures
and is called the sequence of <i>F</i>-squares. It contains the
<em>sequence computed by the machine</em>; the other is called the
sequence of <i>E</i>-squares. The latter are used to mark
<i>F</i>-squares and are there to &ldquo;assist the memory&rdquo;
(Turing 1936&ndash;7: 232). The content of the <i>E</i>-squares is
liable to change. <i>F</i>-squares however cannot be changed which
means that one cannot implement algorithms whereby earlier computed
digits need to be changed. Moreover, the machine will never print a
symbol on an <i>F</i>-square if the <i>F</i>-square preceding it has
not been computed yet. This usage of <i>F</i> and <i>E</i>-squares can
be quite useful (see
 <a href="#InteProgBehaBasiSetFunc">Sec. 2.3</a>)
 but, as was shown by Emil L. Post, it results in a number of
complications (see
 <a href="#PostDefi">Sec. 1.2</a>).</p>
 
<p>
There are two important things to notice about the Turing machine
setup. The first concerns the definition of the machine itself, namely
that the machine&rsquo;s tape is potentially infinite. This
corresponds to an assumption that the memory of the machine is
(potentially) infinite. The second concerns the definition of Turing
computable, namely that a function will be Turing computable if there
exists a set of instructions that will result in a Turing machine
computing the function regardless of the amount of time it takes. One
can think of this as assuming the availability of potentially infinite
time to complete the computation.</p>

<p>
These two assumptions are intended to ensure that the definition of
computation that results is not too narrow. This is, it ensures that
no computable function will fail to be Turing-computable solely
because there is insufficient time or memory to complete the
computation. It follows that there may be some Turing computable
functions which may not be carried out by any existing computer,
perhaps because no existing machine has sufficient memory to carry out
the task. Some Turing computable functions may not ever be computable
in practice, since they may require more memory than can be built
using all of the (finite number of) atoms in the universe. If we
moreover assume that a physical computer is a finite realization of
the Turing machine, and so that the Turing machine functions as a good
formal model for the computer, a result which shows that a function is
not Turing computable is very strong, since it implies that no
computer that we could ever build could carry out the computation. In
Section 2.4, it is shown that there are functions which are not
Turing-computable.</p>

<h3 id="PostDefi">1.2 Post&rsquo;s Definition</h3>

<p>
Turing&rsquo;s definition was standardized through (some of)
Post&rsquo;s modifications of it in Post 1947. In that paper Post
proves that a certain problem from mathematics known as Thue&rsquo;s
problem or the word problem for semi-groups is not Turing computable
(or, in Post&rsquo;s words, recursively unsolvable). Post&rsquo;s main
strategy was to show that if it were decidable then the following
decision problem from Turing 1936&ndash;7 would also be decidable:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>PRINT?</strong> The problem to decide for every Turing machine
<i>M</i> whether or not it will ever print some symbol (for instance,
0).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It was however proven by Turing that <strong>PRINT?</strong> is not
Turing computable and so the same is true of Thue&rsquo;s problem.</p>

<p>
While the uncomputability of <strong>PRINT?</strong> plays a central
role in Post&rsquo;s proof, Post believed that Turing&rsquo;s proof of
that was affected by the &ldquo;spurious Turing convention&rdquo;
(Post 1947: 9), viz. the system of <i>F</i> and <i>E</i>-squares.
Thus, Post introduced a modified version of the Turing machine. The
most important differences between Post&rsquo;s and Turing&rsquo;s
definition are:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
Post&rsquo;s Turing machine, when in a given state, either prints or
moves and so its transition rules are more &lsquo;atomic&rsquo; (it
does not have the composite operation of moving and printing). This
results in the quadruple notation of Turing machines, where each
quadruple is in one of the three forms of
 <a href="#quadruple">Table 3</a>:</p>
 
<div class="figure" id="quadruple">

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Table 3:</span> Post&rsquo;s Quadruple
notation</p> 

\[
\begin{aligned}\hline
&amp; q_iS_jS_{i,j}q_{i,j}\\
&amp; q_iS_jLq_{i,j}\\
&amp; q_iS_jRq_{i,j}\\\hline
\end{aligned}
\]

</div> </li>

<li>Post&rsquo;s Turing machine has only one kind of symbol and so
does not rely on the Turing system of <i>F</i> and
<i>E</i>-squares.</li>

<li>Post&rsquo;s Turing machine has a two-way infinite tape.</li>

<li>Post&rsquo;s Turing machine halts when it reaches a state for
which no actions are defined.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that Post&rsquo;s reformulation of the Turing machine is very
much rooted in his Post 1936. (Some of) Post&rsquo;s modifications of Turing&rsquo;s
definition became part of the definition of the Turing machine in
standard works such as Kleene 1952 and Davis 1958. Since that time,
several (logically equivalent) definitions have been introduced.
Today, standard definitions of Turing machines are, in some respects,
closer to Post&rsquo;s Turing machines than to Turing&rsquo;s
machines. In what follows we will use a variant on the standard
definition from Minsky 1967 which uses the quintuple notation but has no <i>E</i> and
<i>F</i>-squares and includes a special halting state <i>H</i>. It
also has only two move operations, viz., <i>L</i> and <i>R</i> and so
the action whereby the machine merely prints is not used. When the
machine is started, the tape is blank except for some finite portion
of the tape. Note that the blank square can also be represented as a
square containing the symbol \(S_0\) or simply 0. The finite content
of the tape will also be called the <em>dataword</em> on the tape.</p>

<h3 id="DefiForm">1.3 The Definition Formalized</h3>

<p>
Talk of &ldquo;tape&rdquo; and a &ldquo;read-write head&rdquo; is
intended to aid the intuition (and reveals something of the time in
which Turing was writing) but plays no important role in the
definition of Turing machines. In situations where a formal analysis
of Turing machines is required, it is appropriate to spell out the
definition of the machinery and program in more mathematical terms.
Purely formally a Turing machine can be specified as a quadruple \(T =
(Q,\Sigma, s, \delta)\) where:</p>

<ul>

\(\delta\) is a transition function determining the next move: </p>

<p>
The transition function for the machine <i>T</i> is a function from
computation states to computation states. If \(\delta(q_i,S_j) =
(S_{i,j},D,q_{i,j})\), then when the machine&rsquo;s state is \(q_j\),
reading the symbol \(S_j\), \(T\) replaces \(S_j\) by \(S_{i,j}\),
moves in direction \(D \in \{L,R\}\) and goes to state
\(q_{i,j}\).</p>

<h3 id="DescBehaTuriMach">1.4 Describing the Behavior of a Turing Machine</h3>

<p>
We introduce a representation which allows us to describe the behavior
or dynamics of a Turing machine \(T_n\), relying on the notation of
the <em>complete configuration</em> (Turing 1936&ndash;7: 232) also
known today as <em>instantaneous description</em> (ID) (Davis 1982:
6). At any
stage of the computation of \(T_{i}\) its ID is given by:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li><span class="tag">(1)</span><span class="sen">the content of the
tape, that is, its data word</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(2)</span><span class="sen">the location of the
reading head</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(3)</span><span class="sen">the machine&rsquo;s
internal state</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
So, given some Turing machine <i>T</i> which is in state \(q_{i}\)
scanning the symbol \(S_{j}\), its ID is given by \(Pq_{i}S_{j}Q\)
where <i>P</i> and <i>Q</i> are the finite words to the left and right
hand side of the square containing the symbol \(S_{j}\).
 <a href="#CC">Figure 1</a>
 gives a visual representation of an ID of some Turing machine
<i>T</i> in state \(q_i\) scanning the tape.</p>

<h2 id="CompTuriMach">2. Computing with Turing Machines</h2>

<p>
As explained in
 <a href="#TuriDefi">Sec. 1.1</a>,
 Turing machines were originally intended to formalize the notion of
computability in order to tackle a fundamental problem of mathematics.
Independently of Turing, Alonzo Church gave a different but logically
equivalent formulation (see
 <a href="#AlteHistModeComp">Sec. 4</a>).
 Today, most computer scientists agree that Turing&rsquo;s, or any
other logically equivalent, formal notion captures <em>all</em>
computable problems, viz. for any computable problem, there is a
Turing machine which computes it. This is known as the
<em>Church-Turing thesis</em>, <em>Turing&rsquo;s thesis</em> (when
the reference is only to Turing&rsquo;s work) or <em>Church&rsquo;s
thesis</em> (when the reference is only to Church&rsquo;s work).</p>

<p>
It implies that, if accepted, any problem not computable by a Turing
machine is not computable by any finite means whatsoever. Indeed,
since it was Turing&rsquo;s ambition to capture &ldquo;[all] the
possible processes which can be carried out in computing a
number&rdquo; (Turing 1936&ndash;7: 249), it follows that, if we
accept Turing&rsquo;s analysis:</p>

<ul>

<li>Any problem not computable by a Turing machine is not
&ldquo;computable&rdquo; in the absolute sense (at least, absolute
relative to humans, see
 <a href="#PhilIssuRelaTuriMach">Section 3</a>).</li>
 
<li>For any problem that we believe is computable, we should be able
to construct a Turing machine which computes it. To put it in
Turing&rsquo;s wording:

<blockquote>
It is my contention that [the] operations [of a computing machine]
include all those which are used in the computation of a number.
(Turing 1936&ndash;7: 231)
</blockquote> </li>
</ul>

<p>
In this section, examples will be given which illustrate the
computational power and boundaries of the Turing machine
model. Section 3 then discusses some philosophical issues related to
Turing&rsquo;s thesis.</p>

<h3 id="SomeSimpExam">2.1 Some (Simple) Examples</h3>

<p>
In order to speak about a Turing machine that does something useful
from the human perspective, we will have to provide an interpretation
of the symbols recorded on the tape. For example, if we want to design
a machine which will compute some mathematical function, addition say,
then we will need to describe how to interpret the ones and zeros
appearing on the tape as numbers.</p>

<p>
In the examples that follow we will represent the number <em>n</em> as
a block of \(n+1\) copies of the symbol &lsquo;1&rsquo; on the tape.
Thus we will represent the number 0 as a single &lsquo;1&rsquo; and
the number 3 as a block of four &lsquo;1&rsquo;s. This is called
<em>unary notation</em>.</p>

<p>
We will also have to make some assumptions about the configuration of
the tape when the machine is started, and when it finishes, in order
to interpret the computation. We will assume that if the function to
be computed requires <em>n</em> arguments, then the Turing machine
will start with its head scanning the leftmost &lsquo;1&rsquo; of a
sequence of <em>n</em> blocks of &lsquo;1&rsquo;s. The blocks of
&lsquo;1&rsquo;s representing the arguments must be separated by a
single occurrence of the symbol &lsquo;0&rsquo;. For example, to
compute the sum \(3+4\), a Turing machine will start in the
configuration shown in
 <a href="#Initial">Figure 3</a>.</p>
 
<div class="figure" id="Initial">
<img src="Initial.svg" alt="a horizontal strip of concatenated boxed 0s and 1s with the left and right ends of the strip being ragged. The numbers from left to right are 00111101111100000000. The first 1 from the left is red with a label pointing to it stating \(q_{1} : j R q_{1}\) " />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 3:</span> Initial configuration for a
computation over two numbers <i>n</i> and <i>m</i></p>
</div>

<p>
Here the supposed addition machine takes two arguments representing
the numbers to be added, starting at the leftmost 1 of the first
argument. The arguments are separated by a single 0 as required, and
the first block contains four &lsquo;1&rsquo;s, representing the
number 3, and the second contains five &lsquo;1&rsquo;s, representing
the number 4.</p>

<p>
A machine must finish in standard configuration too. There must be a
single block of symbols (a sequence of 1s representing some number or
a symbol representing another kind of output) and the machine must be
scanning the leftmost symbol of that sequence. If the machine
correctly computes the function then this block must represent the
correct answer.</p>

<p>
Adopting this convention for the terminating configuration of a Turing
machine means that we can compose machines by identifying the final
state of one machine with the initial state of the next.</p>

 <a href="#add_simple">Table 4</a>
 gives the transition table of a Turing machine \(T_{\textrm{Add}_2}\)
which adds two natural numbers <i>n</i> and <i>m</i>. We assume the
machine starts in state \(q_1\) scanning the leftmost 1 of
\(n+1\).</p>

<p>
The idea of doing an addition with Turing machines when using unary
representation is to shift the leftmost number <i>n</i> one square to
the right. This is achieved by erasing the leftmost 1 of \(n +1\)
(this is done in state \(q_1\)) and then setting the 0 between \(n+1\)
and \(m+1\) to 1 (state \(q_2\)). We then have \(n + m + 2\) and so we
still need to erase one additional 1. This is done by erasing the
leftmost 1 (states \(q_3\) and \(q_4\)).
 <a href="#animated_simpleadd">Figure 4</a>
 shows this computation for \(3 + 4\).</p>

again that the machine starts in state \(q_1\) scanning the leftmost 1

\(T_{\textrm{Add}_i}\) is given in

<p>
The machine \(T_{\textrm{Add}_i}\) uses the principle of shifting the
addends to the right which was also used for \(T_{\textrm{Add}_2}\).
More particularly, \(T_{add_i}\) computes the sum of \(n_1 + 1\),
\(n_2 + 1\),&hellip; \(n_i+1\) from left to right, viz. it computes
this sum as follows: </p> 

\[\begin{align}
N_1 &amp; = n_1 + n_2 + 1\\
N_2  &amp; = N_1 + n_3 \\
N_3  &amp;= N_2 + n_4\\
 &amp;\vdots\\
N_i  &amp;= N_{i-1} + n_i + 1
\end{align}
\]

<p>
The most important difference between \(T_{\textrm{Add}_2}\) and
\(T_{\textrm{Add}_i}\) is that \(T_{\textrm{Add}_i}\) needs to verify
if the leftmost addend \(N_j, 1 &lt; j \leq i\) is equal to
\(N_i\). This is achieved by checking whether the first 0 to the right
of \(N_j\) is followed by another 0 or not (states \(q_2\) and
\(q_3\)). If it is not the case, then there is at least one more
addend \(n_{j+1}\) to be added. Note that, as was the case for \(T_{\textrm{Add}_2}\), the machine needs to erase an additional one from the addend \(n_{j+1}\) which is done via state \(q_5\). It then moves back to state \(q_1\). 
If, on the other hand, \(N_j = N_i\), the machine moves to the leftmost 1 of \(N_i = n_1 + n_2 + \ldots + n_i + 1 \) and halts.</p>

<h3 id="CompNumbProb">2.2 Computable Numbers and Problems</h3>

<p>
Turing&rsquo;s original paper is concerned with <em>computable (real)
numbers</em>. A (real) number is Turing computable if there exists a
Turing machine which computes an arbitrarily precise approximation to
that number. All of the algebraic numbers (roots of polynomials with
algebraic coefficients) and many transcendental mathematical
constants, such as <em>e</em> and \(\pi\) are Turing-computable.
Turing gave several examples of classes of numbers computable by
Turing machines (see section 10 <em>Examples of large classes of
numbers which are computable</em> of Turing 1936&ndash;7) as a
heuristic argument showing that a wide diversity of classes of numbers
can be computed by Turing machines.</p>

<p>
One might wonder however in what sense computation with numbers, viz.
calculation, captures <em>non-numerical</em> but computable problems
and so how Turing machines capture <em>all</em> general and effective
procedures which determine whether something is the case or not.
Examples of such problems are:</p>

<ul>

<li>&ldquo;decide for any given <i>x</i> whether or not <i>x</i>
denotes a prime&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;decide for any given <i>x</i> whether or not <i>x</i> is
the description of a Turing machine&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In general, these problems are of the form:</p>

<ul>

<li>&ldquo;decide for any given <i>x</i> whether or not <i>x</i> has
property <i>X</i>&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>
An important challenge of both theoretical and concrete advances in
computing (often at the interface with other disciplines) has become
the problem of providing an interpretation of <i>X</i> such that it
can be tackled computationally. To give just one concrete example, in
daily computational practices it might be important to have a method
to decide for any digital &ldquo;source&rdquo; whether or not it can
be trusted and so one needs a computational interpretation of
trust.</p>

<p>
The <em>characteristic function</em> of a predicate is a function
which has the value TRUE or FALSE when given appropriate arguments. In
order for such functions to be computable, Turing relied on
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s insight that these kind of problems can be encoded
as a problem about numbers (See
 <a href="../goedel-incompleteness/index.html">G&ouml;del&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem</a>
 and the next
 <a href="#InteProgBehaBasiSetFunc">Sec. 2.3</a>)
 In Turing&rsquo;s wording:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The expression &ldquo;there is a general process for determining
&hellip;&rdquo; has been used [here] [&hellip;] as equivalent to
&ldquo;there is a machine which will determine &hellip;&rdquo;. This
usage can be justified if and only if we can justify our definition of
&ldquo;computable&rdquo;. For each of these &ldquo;general
process&rdquo; problems can be expressed as a problem concerning a
general process for determining whether a given integer <i>n</i> has a
property \(G(n)\) [e.g. \(G(n)\) might mean &ldquo;<i>n</i> is
satisfactory&rdquo; or &ldquo;<i>n</i> is the G&ouml;del
representation of a provable formula&rdquo;], and this is equivalent
to computing a number whose <i>n</i>-th figure is 1 if \(G(n)\) is
true and 0 if it is false. (1936&ndash;7: 248)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is the possibility of coding the &ldquo;general process&rdquo;
problems as numerical problems that is essential to Turing&rsquo;s
construction of the universal Turing machine and its use within a
proof that shows there are problems that cannot be computed by a
Turing machine.</p>

<h3 id="TuriUnivMach">2.3 Turing&rsquo;s Universal Machine</h3>

<p>
The universal Turing machine which was constructed to prove the
uncomputability of certain problems, is, roughly speaking, a Turing
machine that is able to compute what any other Turing machine
computes. Assuming that the Turing machine notion fully captures
computability (and so that Turing&rsquo;s thesis is valid), it is
implied that anything which can be &ldquo;computed&rdquo;, can also be
computed by that one universal machine. Conversely, any problem that
is not computable by the universal machine is considered to be
uncomputable.</p>

<p>
This is the rhetorical and theoretical power of the universal machine
concept, viz. that one relatively simple formal device captures all
&ldquo;<em>the possible processes which can be carried out in
computing a number</em>&rdquo; (Turing 1936&ndash;7). It is also one
of the main reasons why Turing has been <em>retrospectively</em>
identified as one of the founding fathers of computer science (see
 <a href="#ImpaTuriMachCompScie">Section 5</a>).</p>
 
<p>
So how to construct a universal machine <i>U</i> out of the set of
basic operations we have at our disposal? Turing&rsquo;s approach is
the construction of a machine <i>U</i> which is able to (1)
&lsquo;understand&rsquo; the program of <em>any</em> other machine
\(T_{n}\) and, based on that &ldquo;understanding&rdquo;, (2)
&lsquo;mimic&rsquo; the behavior of \(T_{n}\). To this end, a method
is needed which allows to treat the program and the behavior of
\(T_n\) interchangeably since both aspects are manipulated on the same
tape and by the same machine. This is achieved by Turing in two basic
steps: the development of (1) a notational method (2) a set of
elementary functions which treats that notation&mdash;independent of
whether it is formalizing the program or the behavior of
\(T_n\)&mdash;as text to be compared, copied down, erased, etc. In
other words, Turing develops a technique that allows to treat program
and behavior on the same level.</p>

<h4 id="InteProgBehaNota">2.3.1 Interchangeability of program and behavior: a notation</h4>

<p>
Given some machine \(T_n\), Turing&rsquo;s basic idea is to construct
a machine \(T_n'\) which, rather than directly printing the output
of \(T_n\), prints out the successive complete configurations or
instantaneous descriptions of \(T_n\). In order to achieve this,
\(T_n'\):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[&hellip;] could be made to depend on having the rules of operation
[&hellip;] of [\(T_n\)] written somewhere within itself [&hellip;]
each step could be carried out by referring to these rules. (Turing
1936&ndash;7: 242)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, \(T_n'\) prints out the successive complete
configurations of \(T_n\) by having the program of \(T_n\) written on
its tape. Thus, Turing needs a notational method which makes it
possible to &lsquo;capture&rsquo; two different aspects of a Turing
machine on one and the same tape in such a way they can be treated
<em>by the same machine</em>, viz.:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag2em">

<li><span class="tag">(1)</span><span class="sen"> its description in
terms of <em>what it should do</em>&mdash;the quintuple
notation</span></li>

<li><span class="tag">(2)</span><span class="sen"> its description in
terms of <em>what it is doing</em>&mdash;the complete configuration
notation</span></li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, a first and perhaps most essential step, in the construction of
<i>U</i> are the quintuple and complete configuration notation and
the idea of putting them on the same tape. More particularly, the tape
is divided into two regions which we will call the <i>A</i> and
<i>B</i> region here. The <i>A</i> region contains a notation of the
&lsquo;program&rsquo; of \(T_n\) and the <i>B</i> region a notation
for the successive complete configurations of \(T_n\). In
Turing&rsquo;s paper they are separated by an additional symbol
&ldquo;::&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
To simplify the construction of <i>U</i> and in order to encode any
Turing machine as a unique number, Turing develops a third notation
which permits to express the quintuples and complete configurations
with letters only. This is determined by [Note that we use
Turing&rsquo;s original encoding. Of course, there is a broad variety
of possible encodings, including binary encodings]:</p>

<ul> 

<li>Replacing each state \(q_i\) in a quintuple of \(T_n\) by \[D\underbrace{A\ldots A}_i,\] so, for instance \(q_3\) becomes \(DAAA\).</li>

 

<li>Replacing each symbol \(S_{j}\) in a quintuple of \(T_n\) by \[D\underbrace{C\ldots C}_j,\] so, for instance, \(S_1\) becomes \(DC\).</li>

</ul>

<p>
Using this method, each quintuple of some Turing machine \(T_n\) can
be expressed in terms of a sequence of capital letters and so the
&lsquo;program&rsquo; of any machine \(T_{n}\) can be expressed by the
set of symbols <i>A, C, D, R, L, N</i> and ;. This is the so-called
<em>Standard Description</em> (S.D.) of a Turing machine. Thus, for
instance, the S.D. of \(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\) is: </p> <!-- \label{p_simple}-->

<div class="figure" style="margin-bottom: 10px; letter-spacing: .2ex; word-break: break-all">
;<i>DADDRDAA</i>;<i>DADCDRDAA</i>;<i>DAADDCRDA</i>;<i>DAADCDCRDA</i>
</div>

<p>
This is, essentially, Turing&rsquo;s version of
 <a href="../goedel-incompleteness/sup1.html">G&ouml;del numbering</a>.
 Indeed, as Turing shows, one can easily get a numerical description
representation or <em>Description Number</em> (D.N.) of a Turing
machine \(T_{n}\) by replacing:</p>

<ul>

<li>&ldquo;A&rdquo; by &ldquo;1&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;C&rdquo; by &ldquo;2&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;D&rdquo; by &ldquo;3&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;L&rdquo; by &ldquo;4&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;R&rdquo; by &ldquo;5&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;N&rdquo; by &ldquo;6&rdquo;</li>

<li>&ldquo;;&rdquo; by &ldquo;7&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, the D.N. of \(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\) is: </p>

<div class="figure" style="margin-bottom: 10px; letter-spacing: .2ex; word-break: break-all">
7313353117313135311731133153173113131531
</div>

<p>
Note that every machine \(T_n\) has a unique D.N.; a D.N. represents
one and one machine only.</p>

<p>
Clearly, the method used to determine the \(S.D.\) of some machine
\(T_n\) can also be used to write out the successive complete
configurations of \(T_n\). Using &ldquo;:&rdquo; as a separator
between successive complete configurations, the first few complete
configurations of \(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\) are: </p> <!-- \label{CC_simple} -->

<div class="figure" style="margin-bottom: 10px; letter-spacing: .2ex; word-break: break-all">

</div>

<h4 id="InteProgBehaBasiSetFunc">2.3.2 Interchangeability of program and behavior: a basic set of functions</h4>

<p>
Having a notational method to write the program and successive
complete configurations of some machine \(T_n\) on one and the same
tape of some other machine \(T_n'\) is the first step in
Turing&rsquo;s construction of <i>U</i>. However, <i>U</i> should also
be able to &ldquo;emulate&rdquo; the program of \(T_n\) as written in
region <i>A</i> so that it can actually write out its successive
complete configurations in region <i>B</i>. Moreover it should be
possible to &ldquo;take out and exchange[&hellip;] [the rules of operations of some Turing machine] for
others&rdquo; (Turing 1936&ndash;7: 242). Viz.,
it should be able not just to calculate but also to compute, an issue
that was also dealt with by others such as Church, G&ouml;del and Post
using their own formal devices. It should, for instance, be able to
&ldquo;recognize&rdquo; whether it is in region <i>A</i> or <i>B</i>
and it should be able to determine whether or not a certain sequence
of symbols is the next state \(q_i\) which needs to be executed.</p>

<p>
This is achieved by Turing through the construction of a sequence of
Turing computable problems such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>Finding the leftmost or rightmost occurrence of a sequence of
symbols</li>

<li>Marking a sequence of symbols by some symbol <i>a</i> (remember
that Turing uses two kinds of alternating squares)</li>

<li>Comparing two symbol sequences</li>

<li>Copying a symbol sequence</li>
</ul>

<p>
Turing develops a notational technique, called <em>skeleton
tables</em>, for these functions which serves as a kind of shorthand
notation for a complete Turing machine table but can be easily used to
construct more complicated machines from previous ones. The technique
is quite reminiscent of the recursive technique of composition (see:
 <a href="../recursive-functions/index.html">recursive functions</a>).</p>
 
<p>
To illustrate how such functions are Turing computable, we discuss one
such function in more detail, viz. the compare function. It is
constructed on the basis of a number of other Turing computable
functions which are built on top of each other. In order to understand
how these functions work, remember that Turing used a system of
alternating <i>F</i> and <i>E</i>-squares where the <i>F</i>-squares
contain the actual quintuples and complete configurations and the
<i>E</i>-squares are used as a way to mark off certain parts of the
machine tape. For the comparing of two sequences \(S_1\) and \(S_2\),
each symbol of \(S_1\) will be marked by some symbol <i>a</i> and each
symbol of \(S_2\) will be marked by some symbol <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>
Turing defined nine different functions to show how the compare
function can be computed with Turing machines:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li>FIND\((q_{i}, q_{j},a)\): this machine function searches for the
leftmost occurrence of <i>a</i>. If <i>a</i> is found, the machine
moves to state \(q_{i}\) else it moves to state \(q_{j}\). This is
achieved by having the machine first move to the beginning of the tape
(indicated by a special mark) and then to have it move right until it
finds <i>a</i> or reaches the rightmost symbol on the tape.</li>

<li>FINDL\((q_{i}, q_{j},a)\): the same as FIND but after <i>a</i> has
been found, the machine moves one square to the left. This is used in
functions which need to compute on the symbols in <i>F</i>-squares
which are marked by symbols <i>a</i> in the <i>E</i>-squares.</li>

<li>ERASE\((q_{i},q_{j},a)\): the machine computes FIND. If <i>a</i> is
found, it erases <i>a</i> and goes to state \(q_{i}\) else it goes to
state \(q_{j}\)</li>

<li>ERASE_ALL\((q_j,a) = \textrm{ERASE}(\textrm{ERASE}\_\textrm{ALL},
q_j,a)\): the machines computes ERASE on <i>a</i> repeatedly until all
<i>a</i>&rsquo;s have been erased. Then it moves to \(q_{j}\).</li>

<li>EQUAL\((q_i,q_j,a)\): the machine checks whether or not the
current symbol is <i>a</i>. If yes, it moves to state \(q_i\) else it
moves to state \(q_j\)</li>

<li>CMP_XY\((q_i,q_j,b) = \textrm{FINDL(EQUAL}(q_i,q_j,x), q_j, b)\):
whatever the current symbol <i>x</i>, the machine computes FINDL on
<i>b</i> (and so looks for the symbol marked by <i>b</i>). If there is
a symbol <i>y</i> marked with <i>b</i>, the machine computes
\(\textrm{EQUAL}\) on <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>, else, the machine goes to
state \(q_j\). In other words, CMP_XY\((q_i,q_j,b)\) compares whether
the current symbol is the same as the leftmost symbol marked
<i>b</i>.</li>

<li>COMPARE_MARKED\((q_i,q_j,q_n,a,b)\): the machine checks whether
the leftmost symbols marked <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> respectively are the
same. If there is no symbol marked <i>a</i> nor <i>b</i>, the machine
goes to state \(q_{n}\); if there is a symbol marked <i>a</i> and one
marked <i>b</i> and they are the same, the machine goes to state
\(q_i\), else the machine goes to state \(q_j\). The function is
computed as \(\textrm{FINDL(CMP}\_XY(q_i,q_j,b),
\textrm{FIND}(q_j,q_n,b),a)\)</li>

<li>\(\textrm{COMPARE}\_\textrm{ERASE}(q_iq_j,q_n,a,b)\): the same as
COMPARE_MARKED but when the symbols marked <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are the same,
the marks <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are erased. This is achieved by
computing \(\textrm{ERASE}\) first on <i>a</i> and then on
<i>b</i>.</li>

<li>

<p>
\(\textrm{COMPARE}\_\textrm{ALL}(q_j,q_n,a,b)\) The machine compares
the sequences <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> marked with <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
respectively. This is done by repeatedly computing COMPARE_ERASE on <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i>. If <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are equal, all <i>a</i>&rsquo;s and
<i>b</i>&rsquo;s will have been erased and the machine moves to state
\(q_j\), else, it will move to state \(q_n\). It is computed by

\[\textrm{COMPARE}\_\textrm{ERASE}(\textrm{COMPARE}\_\textrm{ALL}(q_j,q_n,a,b),q_j,q_n,a,b)\]

 and so by recursively calling
\(\textrm{COMPARE}\_\textrm{ALL}\).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
In a similar manner, Turing defines the following functions:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li>\(\textrm{COPY}(q_i,a)\): copy the sequence of symbols marked with
<i>a</i>&rsquo;s to the right of the last complete configuration and
erase the marks.</li>

<li>\(\textrm{COPY}_{n}(q_i, a_1,a_2,\ldots ,a_n)\): copy down the
sequences marked \(a_1\) to \(a_n\) to the right of the last complete
configuration and erase all marks \(a_i\).</li>

<li>\(\textrm{REPLACE}(q_i, a,b)\): replace all letters <i>a</i> by
<i>b</i></li>

<li>\(\textrm{MARK_NEXT_CONFIG}(q_i,a)\): mark the first configuration
\(q_iS_j\) to the right of the machine&rsquo;s head with the letter
<i>a</i>.</li>

<li>\(\textrm{FIND}\_\textrm{RIGHT}(q_i,a)\): find the rightmost
symbol <i>a</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Using the basic functions COPY, REPLACE and COMPARE, Turing constructs
a universal Turing machine.</p>

<p>
Below is an outline of the universal Turing machine indicating how
these basic functions indeed make possible universal computation. It
is assumed that upon initialization, <i>U</i> has on its tape the S.D.
of some Turing machine \(T_n\). Remember that Turing uses the system
of alternating <i>F</i> and <i>E</i>-squares and so, for instance, the
S.D. of \(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\) will be written on the tape of
<i>U</i> as: </p>

<div class="figure" style="margin-bottom: 10px; letter-spacing: .2ex; word-break: break-all">
;_<i>D</i>_<i>A</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>R</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>A</i>_<i>A</i>_<i>;</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>A</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>C</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>R</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>A</i>_<i>A</i>_<i>;</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>A</i>_<i>A</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>C</i>_<i>R</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>A</i>_<i>;</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>A</i>_<i>A</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>C</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>C</i>_<i>R</i>_<i>D</i>_<i>A</i>_
</div>

<p>
where &ldquo;_&rdquo; indicates an unmarked <i>E</i>-square.</p>

<ul>

<li>INIT: To the right of the rightmost quintuple of
<i>T</i>_<i>n</i>, <i>U</i> prints ::_:_<i>D</i>_<i>A</i>_, where _
indicates an unmarked <i>E</i>-square.</li>

<li>

<p>
FIND_NEXT_STATE: The machine first marks (1) with <i>y</i> the
configuration \(q_{CC,i}S_{CC,j}\) of the rightmost (and so last)
complete configuration computed by <i>U</i> in the <i>B</i> part of
the tape and (2) with <i>x</i> the configuration \(q_{q,m}S_{q,n}\) of
the leftmost quintuple which is not preceded by a marked (with the
letter <i>z</i>) semicolon in the <i>A</i> part of the tape. The two
configurations are compared. If they are identical, the machine moves
to MARK_OPERATIONS, if not, it marks the semicolon preceding
\(q_{q,m}S_{q,n}\) with <i>z</i> and goes to FIND_NEXT_STATE. This is
easily achieved using the function COMPARE_ALL which means that,
whatever the outcome of the comparison, the marks <i>x</i> and
<i>y</i> will be erased. For instance, suppose that \(T_n =
T_{\textrm{Simple}}\) and that the last complete configuration of
\(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\) as computed by <i>U</i> is: </p> 

\[\tag{1}
\label{CC_univ}
:\_\underbrace{D\_}_{S_0}\underbrace{D\_C\_}_{S_1}\underbrace{D\_}_{S_0}\textcolor{orange}{\underbrace{D\_A\_A\_}_{q_{2}}\underbrace{D\_}_{S_0}}
\]

<p>
Then <i>U</i> will move to region <i>A</i> and determine that the
corresponding quintuple is: </p> 

\[\tag{2}\label{quint_univ}
\textcolor{orange}{\underbrace{D\_A\_A\_}_{q_{2}}\underbrace{D\_}_{S_{0}}}\underbrace{D\_C\_}_{S_1}\underbrace{R\_}\underbrace{D\_A\_}_{q_1}\]

 </li>

<li>

<p>
MARK_OPERATIONS: The machine <i>U</i> marks the operations that it
needs to execute in order to compute the next complete configuration
of \(T_n\). The printing and move (L,R, N) operations are marked with
<i>u</i> and the next state with <i>y</i>. All marks <i>z</i> are
erased. Continuing with our example, <i>U</i> will mark
\(\eqref{quint_univ}\) as follows: </p> 

\[D\_A\_A\_D\_\textcolor{magenta}{DuCuRu}\textcolor{green}{DyAy}\]

 </li>

<li>

<p>
MARK_COMPCONFIG: The last complete configuration of \(T_n\) as
computed by <i>U</i> is marked into four regions: the configuration
\(q_{CC,i}S_{CC,j}\) itself is left unmarked; the symbol just
preceding it is marked with an <i>x</i> and the remaining symbols to
the left or marked with <i>v</i>. Finally, all symbols to the right,
if any, are marked with <i>w</i> and a &ldquo;:&rdquo; is printed to
the right of the rightmost symbol in order to indicate the beginning
of the next complete configuration of \(T_n\) to be computed by
<i>U</i>. Continuing with our example, \(\eqref{CC_univ}\) will be
marked as follows by <i>U</i>: </p> 

\[\textcolor{red}{\underbrace{Dv}_{S_0}\underbrace{DvCv}_{S_1}}\textcolor{blue}{\underbrace{Dx}_{S_0}}\underbrace{D\_A\_A\_}_{q_2}\underbrace{D\_}_{S_0}:\_\]

<p>
<i>U</i> then goes to PRINT</p></li>

<li>PRINT. It is determined if, in the instructions that have been
marked in MARK_OPERATIONS, there is an operation Print 0 or Print 1.
If that is the case, \(0:\) respectively \(1:\) is printed to the
right of the last complete configuration. This is not a necessary
function but Turing insisted on having <i>U</i> print out not just the
(coded) complete configurations computed by \(T_n\) but also the
actual (binary) real number computed by \(T_n\).</li>

<li>

<p>
PRINT_COMPLETE_CONFIGURATION. <i>U</i> prints the next complete
configuration and erases all marks <i>u, v, w, x, y</i>. It then
returns to FIND_NEXT_STATE. <i>U</i> first searches for the rightmost
letter <i>u</i>, to check which move is needed (<i>R, L, N</i>) and
erases the mark <i>u</i> for <i>R, L, N</i>. Depending on the value
<i>L, R</i> or <i>N</i> will then write down the next complete
configuration by applying COPY\(_5\) to <i>u, v, w, x, y</i>. The move
operation (<i>L, R, N</i>) is accounted for by the particular
combination of <i>u, v, w, x, y</i>: </p> 

\[\begin{array}{ll}
\textrm{When ~} L: &amp;
\textrm{COPY}_5(\textrm{FIND}\_\textrm{NEXT}\_\textrm{STATE},
\textcolor{red}{v},\textcolor{green}{y},\textcolor{blue}{x},\textcolor{magenta}{u},\textcolor{RawSienna}{w})\\
\textrm{When ~} R: &amp;
\textrm{COPY}_5(\textrm{FIND}\_\textrm{NEXT}\_\textrm{STATE},
\textcolor{red}{v},\textcolor{blue}{x},\textcolor{magenta}{u},\textcolor{green}{y},\textcolor{RawSienna}{w})\\
\textrm{When ~} N: &amp;
\textrm{COPY}_5(\textrm{FIND}\_\textrm{NEXT}\_\textrm{STATE},
\textcolor{red}{v},\textcolor{blue}{x},\textcolor{green}{y},\textcolor{magenta}{u},\textcolor{RawSienna}{w})
\end{array}\] 

<p>Following our example, since \(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\)
needs to move right, the new rightmost complete configursiation of
\(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\) written on the tape of <i>U</i> is: </p>

\[\textcolor{red}{\underbrace{D\_}_{S_0}\underbrace{D\_C\_}_{S_1}}\textcolor{blue}{\underbrace{D\_}_{S_0}}\textcolor{magenta}{\underbrace{D\_C\_}_{S_1}}\textcolor{green}{\underbrace{D\_A\_}_{q_1}}
\]

<p>
Since we have that for this complete configuration the square being
scanned by \(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\) is one that was not included in the
previous complete configuration (viz. \(T_{\textrm{Simple}}\) has
reached beyond the rightmost previous point) the complete
configuration as written out by <i>U</i> is in fact incomplete. This
small defect was corrected by Post (Post 1947) by including an additional instruction in the function
used to mark the complete configuration in the next round.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
As is clear, Turing&rsquo;s universal machine indeed requires that
program and &lsquo;data&rsquo; produced by that program are
manipulated interchangeably, viz. the program and its productions are
put next to each other and treated in the same manner, as sequences of
letters to be copied, marked, erased and compared.</p>

<p>
Turing&rsquo;s particular construction is quite intricate with its
reliance on the <i>F</i> and <i>E</i>-squares, the use of a rather
large set of symbols and a rather arcane notation used to describe the
different functions discussed above. Since 1936 several modifications
and simplifications have been implemented. The removal of the
difference between <i>F</i> and <i>E</i>-squares was already discussed
in
 <a href="#PostDefi">Section 1.2</a>
 and it was proven by Shannon that any Turing machine, including the
universal machine, can be reduced to a binary Turing machine (Shannon
1956). Since the 1950s, there has been quite some research on what
could be the smallest possible universal devices (with respect to the
number of states and symbols) and quite some &ldquo;small&rdquo;
universal Turing machines have been found. These results are usually
achieved by relying on other equivalent models of computability such
as, for instance, tag systems. For a survey on research into small
universal devices (see Margenstern 2000; Woods &amp; Neary 2009).</p>

<h3 id="HaltProbEnts">2.4 The Halting Problem and the Entscheidungsproblem</h3>

<p>
As explained, the purpose of Turing&rsquo;s paper was to show that the
Entscheidungsproblem for first-order logic is not computable. The same
result was achieved independently by Church (1936a, 1936b) using a different kind of formal device which is logically
equivalent to a Turing machine (see
 <a href="#AlteHistModeComp">Sec. 4</a>).
 The result went very much against what Hilbert had hoped to achieve
with his finitary and formalist program. Indeed, next to
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s incompleteness results, they broke much of
Hilbert&rsquo;s dream of making mathematics void of
<em>Ignorabimus</em> and which was explicitly expressed in the
following words of Hilbert:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The true reason why Comte could not find an unsolvable problem, lies
in my opinion in the assertion that there exists no unsolvable
problem. Instead of the stupid Ignorabimus, our solution should be: We
must know. We shall know. (1930: 963) [translation by the author] </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that the solvability Hilbert is referring to here concerns
solvability of mathematical problems in general and not just
mechanically solvable. It is shown however in Mancosu et al. 2009 (p.
94), that this general aim of solving every mathematical problem,
underpins two particular convictions of Hilbert namely that (1) the
axioms of number theory are complete and (2) that there are no
undecidable problems in mathematics.</p>

<h4 id="DireIndiProoUncoDeciProb">2.4.1 Direct and indirect proofs of uncomputable decision problems</h4>

<p>
So, how can one show, for a particular decision problem
\(\textrm{D}_i\), that it is not computable? There are two main
methods:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Indirect proof:</strong> take some problem
\(\textrm{D}_{\textrm{uncomp}}\) which is already known to be
uncomputable and show that the problem &ldquo;reduces&rdquo; to
\(\textrm{D}_{i}\).</li>

<li><strong>Direct proof:</strong> prove the uncomputability of
\(\textrm{D}_{i}\) directly by assuming some version of the
Church-Turing thesis.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Today, one usually relies on the first method while it is evident that
in the absence of a problem \(\textrm{D}_{\textrm{uncomp}}\), Turing
but also Church and Post (see
 <a href="#AlteHistModeComp">Sec. 4</a>)
 had to rely on the direct approach.</p>

<p>
The notion of reducibility has its origins in the work of Turing and
Post who considered several variants of computability (Post 1947;
Turing 1939). The concept was later appropriated in the context of
computational complexity theory and is today one of the basic concepts
of both computability and computational complexity theory (Odifreddi
1989; Sipser 1996). Roughly speaking, a reduction of a problem \(D_i\)
to a problem \(D_j\) comes down to providing an effective procedure
for translating every instance \(d_{i,m}\) of the problem \(D_i\) to
an instance \(d_{j,n}\) of \(D_j\) in such a way that an effective
procedure for solving \(d_{j,n}\) also yields an effective procedure
for solving \(d_{i,m}\). In other words, if \(D_i\) reduces to \(D_j\)
then, if \(D_i\) is uncomputable so is \(D_j\). Note that the
reduction of one problem to another can also be used in decidability
proofs: if \(D_i\) reduces to \(D_j\) and \(D_j\) is known to be
computable then so is \(D_i\).</p>

<p>
In the absence of <strong>D</strong>\(_{\textrm{uncomp}}\) a very
different approach was required and Church, Post and Turing each used
more or less the same approach to this end (Gandy 1988). First of all,
one needs a formalism which captures the notion of computability.
Turing proposed the Turing machine formalism to this end. A second
step is to show that there are problems that are not computable within
the formalism. To achieve this, a uniform process <strong>U</strong>
needs to be set-up relative to the formalism which is able to compute
every computable number. One can then use (some form of)
diagonalization in combination with <strong>U</strong> to derive a
contradiction. Diagonalization was introduced by Cantor to show that
the set of real numbers is &ldquo;uncountable&rdquo; or not
denumerable. A variant of the method was used also by G&ouml;del in
the proof of his
 <a href="../goedel-incompleteness/sup2.html">first incompleteness theorem</a>.</p>
 
<h4 id="TuriBasiProbCIRCPRINEnts">2.4.2 Turing&rsquo;s basic problem CIRC?, PRINT? and the Entscheidungsproblem</h4>

<p>
Recall that in Turing&rsquo;s original version of the Turing machine,
the machines are computing real numbers. This implied that a
&ldquo;well-behaving&rdquo; Turing machine should in fact never halt
and print out an infinite sequence of figures. Such machines were
identified by Turing as <em>circle-free</em>. All other machines are
called <em>circular machines</em>. A number <i>n</i> which is the D.N.
of a circle-free machine is called <em>satisfactory</em>.</p>

<p>
This basic difference is used in Turing&rsquo;s proof of the
uncomputability of:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>CIRC?</strong> The problem to decide for every number <i>n</i>
whether or not it is satisfactory</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The proof of the uncomputability of <strong>CIRC?</strong> uses the
construction of a hypothetical and circle-free machine \(T_{decide}\)
which computes the diagonal sequence of the set of all computable
numbers computed by the circle-free machines. Hence, it relies for its
construction on the universal Turing machine and a hypothetical
machine that is able to decide <strong>CIRC?</strong> for each number
<i>n</i> given to it. It is shown that the machine \(T_{decide}\)
becomes a circular machine when it is provided with its own
description number, hence the assumption of a machine which is capable
of solving <strong>CIRC?</strong> must be false.</p>

<p>
Based on the uncomputability of <strong>CIRC?</strong>, Turing then
shows that also <strong>PRINT?</strong> is not computable. More
particularly he shows that if <strong>PRINT?</strong> were to be
computable, also <strong>CIRC?</strong> would be decidable, viz. he
rephrases <strong>PRINT?</strong> in such a way that it becomes the
problem to decide for any machine whether or not it will print an
infinity of symbols which would amount to deciding
<strong>CIRC?</strong>.</p>

<p>
Finally, based on the uncomputability of <strong>PRINT?</strong>
Turing shows that the Entscheidungsproblem is not decidable. This is
achieved by showing:</p>

<ol>

<li>how for each Turing machine <i>T</i>, it is possible to construct
a corresponding formula <strong>T</strong> in first-order logic
and</li>

<li>if there is a general method for determining whether
<strong>T</strong> is provable, then there is a general method for
proving that <i>T</i> will ever print 0. This is the problem
<strong>PRINT?</strong> and so cannot be decidable (provided we accept
Turing&rsquo;s thesis).</li>
</ol>

<p>
It thus follows from the uncomputability of <strong>PRINT?</strong>,
that the Entscheidungsproblem is not computable.</p>

<h4 id="HaltProb">2.4.3 The halting problem</h4>

<p>
Given Turing&rsquo;s focus on computable real numbers, his base
decision problem is about determining whether or not some Turing
machine will <em>not</em> halt and so is not quite the same as the
more well-known halting problem:</p>

<div class="indent">

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>HALT?</strong> The problem to decide for every Turing
machine <i>T</i> whether or not <i>T</i> will halt.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Turing&rsquo;s problem <strong>PRINT?</strong> is in fact very close
to <strong>HALT?</strong> (see Davis 1958: Chapter 5, Theorem
2.3).</p>

<p>
A popular proof of <strong>HALT?</strong> goes as follows. Assume that
<strong>HALT?</strong> is computable. Then it should be possible to
construct a Turing machine which decides, for each machine \(T_i\) and
some input <i>w</i> for \(T_i\) whether or not \(T_i\) will halt on
<i>w</i>. Let us call this machine \(T_{H}\). More particularly, we
have:</p> 

\[
T_H(T_i,w) = \left\{ 
 \begin{array}{ll} 
 \textrm{HALT} &amp; \textrm{if \(T_i\) halts on } w\\
 \textrm{LOOP} &amp; \textrm{if \(T_i\) loops on } w
 \end{array} \right.
\]

<p>
We now define a second machine \(T_D\) which relies on the assumption
that the machine \(T_H\) can be constructed. More particularly, we
have: </p> 

\[
T_D(T_i,D.N.~of~ T_i) = \left\{ 
\begin{array}{ll} 
 \textrm{HALT} &amp; \textrm{if \(T_i\) does not halt on its own} \\
               &amp; \qquad \textrm{description number}\\ 
\textrm{LOOP} &amp; \textrm{if \(T_i\) halts on its own} \\
               &amp; \qquad \textrm{description number}\\ 
 \end{array} 
\right.
\]

<p>
If we now set \(T_i\) to \(T_D\) we end up with a contradiction: if
\(T_D\) halts it means that \(T_D\) does not halt and vice versa. A
popular but quite informal variant of this proof was given by
Christopher Strachey in the context of programming (Strachey
1965).</p>

<h3 id="VariTuriMach">2.5 Variations on the Turing machine</h3>

<p>
As is clear from
 <a href="#TuriDefi">Sections 1.1</a>
 and
 <a href="#PostDefi">1.2</a>,
 there is a variety of definitions of the Turing machine. One can use
a quintuple or quadruple notation; one can have different types of
symbols or just one; one can have a two-way infinite or a one-way
infinite tape; etc. Several other less obvious modifications have been
considered and used in the past. These modifications can be of two
kinds: generalizations or restrictions. These do not result in
&ldquo;stronger&rdquo; or &ldquo;weaker&rdquo; models. Viz. these
modified machines compute no more and no less than the Turing
computable functions. This adds to the robustness of the Turing
machine definition.</p>

<h5 class="runon" id="binary-machines">Binary machines</h5>

<p>
In his short 1936 note Post considers machines that either mark or unmark a square which
means we have only two symbols \(S_0\) and \(S_1\) but he did not
prove that this formulation captures exactly the Turing computable
functions. It was Shannon who proved that for any Turing machine
<i>T</i> with <i>n</i> symbols there is a Turing machine with two
symbols that simulates <i>T</i> (Shannon 1956). He also showed that
for any Turing machine with <i>m</i> states, there is a Turing machine
with only two states that simulates it.</p>

<h5 id="non-erasing-machines">Non-erasing machines</h5>

<p>
Non-erasing machines are machines that can only overprint \(S_0\). In
Moore 1952, it was mentioned that Shannon proved that non-erasing
machines can compute what any Turing machine computes. This result was
given in a context of actual digital computers of the 50s which relied
on punched tape (and so, for which, one cannot erase). Shannon&rsquo;s
result however remained unpublished. It was Wang who published the
result (Wang 1957).</p>

<h5 id="non-writing-machines">Non-writing machines</h5>

<p>
It was shown by Minsky that for every Turing machine there is a
non-writing Turing machine with two tapes that simulates it.</p>

<h5 id="multiple-tapes">Multiple tapes</h5>

<p>
Instead of one tape one can consider a Turing machine with multiple
tapes. This turned out the be very useful in several different
contexts. For instance, Minsky, used two-tape non-writing Turing machines to prove that a certain decision problem defined by Post (the decision problem for tag systems) is
non-Turing computable (Minsky 1961). Hartmanis and Stearns then,
in their founding paper for computational complexity theory, proved
that any <i>n</i>-tape Turing machine reduces to a single tape Turing
machine and so anything that can be computed by an <i>n</i>-tape or
multitape Turing machine can also be computed by a single tape Turing
machine, and conversely (Hartmanis &amp; Stearns 1965). They used
multitape machines because they were considered to be closer to actual
digital computers.</p>

<h5 id="n-dimensional-turing-machines"><i>n</i>-dimensional Turing machines</h5>

<p>
Another variant is to consider Turing machines where the tape is not
one-dimensional but <i>n</i>-dimensional. This variant too reduces to
the one-dimensional variant.</p>

<h5 id="non-deterministic-machines">Non-deterministic machines</h5>

<p>
An apparently more radical reformulation of the notion of Turing
machine is that of non-deterministic Turing machines. As explained in
 <a href="#TuriDefi">1.1</a>,
 one fundamental condition of Turing&rsquo;s machines is the so-called
determinacy condition, viz. the idea that at any given moment, the
machine&rsquo;s behavior is completely determined by the configuration
or state it is in and the symbol it is scanning. Next to these, Turing
also mentions the idea of choice machines for which the next state is
not completely determined by the state and symbol pair. Instead, some
external device makes a random choice of what to do next.
Non-deterministic Turing machines are a kind of choice machines: for
each state and symbol pair, the non-deterministic machine makes an
arbitrary choice between a finite (possibly zero) number of states.
Thus, unlike the computation of a deterministic Turing machine, the
computation of a non-deterministic machine is a tree of possible
configuration paths. One way to visualize the computation of a
non-deterministic Turing machine is that the machine spawns an exact
copy of itself and the tape for each alternative available transition,
and each machine continues the computation. If any of the machines
terminates successfully, then the entire computation terminates and
inherits that machine&rsquo;s resulting tape. Notice the word
successfully in the preceding sentence. In this formulation, some
states are designated as <em>accepting states</em> and when the
machine terminates in one of these states, then the computation is
successful, otherwise the computation is unsuccessful and any other
machines continue in their search for a successful outcome. The
addition of non-determinism to Turing machines does not alter the
extent of Turing-computability. Non-determinism was introduced for
finite automata in the paper, Rabin &amp; Scott 1959, where it is also
shown that adding non-determinism does not result in more powerful
automata. Non-deterministic Turing machines are an important model in
the context of
 <a href="../computational-complexity/index.html">computational complexity theory</a>.</p>
 
<h5 id="weak-and-semi-weak-machines">Weak and semi-weak machines</h5>

<p>
Weak Turing machines are machines where some word over the alphabet is
repeated infinitely often to the left and right of the input.
Semi-weak machines are machines where some word is repeated infinitely
often either to the left or right of the input. These machines are
generalizations of the standard model in which the initial tape
contains some finite word (possibly nil). They were introduced to
determine smaller universal machines. Watanabe was the first to define
a universal semi-weak machine with six states and five symbols
(Watanabe 1961). Recently, a number of researchers have determined
several small weak and semi-weak universal Turing machines (e.g.,
Woods &amp; Neary 2007; Cook 2004)</p>

<p>
Besides these variants on the Turing machine model, there are also
variants that result in models which capture, in some well-defined
sense, more than the (Turing)-computable functions. Examples of such
models are oracle machines (Turing 1939), infinite-time Turing
machines (Hamkins &amp; Lewis 2008) and accelerating Turing machines
(Copeland 2002). There are various reasons for introducing such
stronger models. Some are well-known models of computability or
recursion theory and are used in the theory of higher-order recursion
and relative computability (oracle machines); others, like the
accelerating machines, were introduced in the context of
 <a href="../spacetime-supertasks/index.html">supertasks</a>
 and the idea of providing physical models that &ldquo;compute&rdquo;
functions which are not Turing-computable.</p>

<h2 id="PhilIssuRelaTuriMach">3. Philosophical Issues Related to Turing Machines</h2>

<h3 id="HumaMachComp">3.1 Human and Machine Computations</h3>

<p>
In its original context, Turing&rsquo;s identification between the
computable numbers and Turing machines was aimed at proving that the
Entscheidungsproblem is <em>not</em> a computable problem and so not a
so-called &ldquo;general process&rdquo; problem (Turing 1936&ndash;7:
248). The basic assumption to be made for this result is that our
&ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; notion of computability can be formally
defined as Turing computability and so that there are no
&ldquo;computable&rdquo; problems that are not Turing computable. But
what was Turing&rsquo;s &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; notion of
computability and how can we be sure that it really covers all
computable problems, and, more generally, all kinds of computations?
This is a very basic question in the
 <a href="../computer-science/index.html">philosophy of computer science</a>.</p>
 
<p>
At the time Turing was writing his paper, the modern computer was not
developed yet and so rephrasings of Turing&rsquo;s thesis which
identify Turing computability with computability by a modern computer
are interpretations rather than historically correct statements of
Turing&rsquo;s thesis. The existing computing machines at the time
Turing wrote his paper, such as the differential analyzer or desk
calculators, were quite restricted in what they could compute and were
used in a context of human computational practices (Grier 2007). It is
thus not surprising that Turing did not attempt to formalize machine
computation but rather human computation and so computable problems in
Turing&rsquo;s paper become computable by human means. This is very
explicit in Section 9 of Turing 1936&ndash;7 where he shows that
Turing machines are a &lsquo;natural&rsquo; model of (human)
computation by analyzing the process of human computation. The
analysis results in a kind of abstract human &lsquo;computor&rsquo;
who fulfills a set of different conditions that are rooted in
Turing&rsquo;s recognition of a set of human limitations which
restrict what we can compute (of our sensory apparatus but also of our
mental apparatus). This &lsquo;computor&rsquo; computes (real) numbers
on an infinite one-dimensional tape divided into squares [Note: Turing
assumed that the reduction of the 2-dimensional character of the paper
a human mathematician usually works on &ldquo;is not essential of
computation&rdquo; (Turing 1936&ndash;7: 249)]. It has the following
restrictions (Gandy 1988; Sieg 1994):</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li><strong>Determinacy condition D</strong> &ldquo;The behaviour of
the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is
observing and his &lsquo;state of mind&rsquo; at that moment.&rdquo;
(Turing 1936&ndash;7: 250)</li>

<li><strong>Boundedness condition B1</strong> &ldquo;there is a bound
B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe
at one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive
observations.&rdquo; (Turing 1936&ndash;7: 250)</li>

<li><strong>Boundedness condition B2</strong> &ldquo;the number of
states of mind which need be taken into account is finite&rdquo;
(Turing 1936&ndash;7: 250)</li>

<li><strong>Locality condition L1</strong> &ldquo;We may [&hellip;]
assume that the squares whose symbols are changed are always
&lsquo;observed&rsquo; squares.&rdquo; (Turing 1936&ndash;7: 250)</li>

<li><strong>Locality condition L2</strong> &ldquo;each of the new
observed squares is within <i>L</i> squares of an immediately
previously observed square.&rdquo; (Turing 1936&ndash;7: 250)</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is this so-called &ldquo;direct appeal to intuition&rdquo;
(1936&ndash;7: 249) of Turing&rsquo;s analysis and resulting model
that explain why the Turing machine is today considered by many as the
best standard model of computability (for a strong statement of this
point of view, see Soare 1996). Indeed, from the above set of
conditions one can quite easily derive Turing&rsquo;s machines. This
is achieved basically by analyzing the restrictive conditions into
&ldquo;&lsquo;simple operations&rsquo; which are so elementary that it
is not easy to imagine them further divided&rdquo; (Turing
1936&ndash;7: 250).</p>

<p>
Note that while Turing&rsquo;s analysis focuses on human computation,
the application of his identification between (human) computation and
Turing machine computation to the Entscheidungsproblem suggests that
he did <em>not</em> consider the possibility of a model of computation
that somehow goes &ldquo;beyond&rdquo; human computation and is
capable of providing an effective and general procedure which solves
the Entscheidungsproblem. If that would have been the case, he would
not have considered the Entscheidungsproblem to be uncomputable.</p>

<p>
The focus on human computation in Turing&rsquo;s analysis of
computation, has led researchers to extend Turing&rsquo;s analysis to
computation by physical devices. This results in (versions of) the
physical Church-Turing thesis. Robin Gandy focused on extending
Turing&rsquo;s analysis to discrete mechanical devices (note that he
did not consider analog machines). More particularly, like Turing,
Gandy starts from a basic set of restrictions of computation by
discrete mechanical devices and, on that basis, develops a new model
which he proved to be reducible to the Turing machine model. This work
is continued by Wilfried Sieg who proposed the framework of Computable
Dynamical Systems (Sieg 2008). Others have considered the possibility
of &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; models from physics which
&ldquo;compute&rdquo; something that is not Turing computable. See for
instance Aaronson, Bavarian, &amp; Gueltrini 2016 (Other Internet
Resources) in which it is shown that <em>if</em> closed timelike curves
would exist, the halting problem would become solvable with finite
resources. Others have proposed alternative models for computation
which are inspired by the Turing machine model but capture specific
aspects of current computing practices for which the Turing machine
model is considered less suited. One example here are the persistent
Turing machines intended to capture interactive processes. Note
however that these results do not show that there are
&ldquo;computable&rdquo; problems that are not Turing
computable. These and other related proposals have been considered by
some authors as reasonable models of computation that somehow compute
more than Turing machines. It is the latter kind of statements that
became affiliated with research on so-called hypercomputation
resulting in the early 2000s in a rather fierce debate in the computer
science community, see, e.g., Teuscher 2004 for various positions.</p>

<h3 id="ThesDefiAxioTheo">3.2 Thesis, Definition, Axioms or Theorem</h3>

<p>
As is clear, strictly speaking, Turing&rsquo;s thesis is not provable,
since, in its original form, it is a claim about the relationship
between a formal and a vague or intuitive concept. By consequence,
many consider it as a thesis or a definition. The thesis would be
refuted if one would be able to provide an intuitively acceptable
effective procedure for a task that is not Turing-computable. This
far, no such counterexample has been found. Other independently
defined notions of computability based on alternative foundations,
such as
 <a href="../recursive-functions/index.html">recursive functions</a>
 and abacus machines have also been shown to be equivalent to Turing
computability. These equivalences between quite different formulations
indicate that there is a natural and robust notion of computability
underlying our understanding. Given this apparent robustness of our
notion of computability, some have proposed to avoid the notion of a
thesis altogether and instead propose a set of axioms used to sharpen
the informal notion. There are several approaches, most notably, an
approach of structural axiomatization where computability itself is
axiomatized (Sieg 2008) and one whereby an axiomatization is given
from which the Church-Turing thesis can be derived (Dershowitz &amp;
Gurevich 2008).</p>

<h2 id="AlteHistModeComp">4. Alternative Historical Models of Computability</h2>

<p>
Besides the Turing machine, several other models were introduced
independently of Turing in the context of research into the foundation
of mathematics which resulted in theses that are logically equivalent
to Turing&rsquo;s thesis. For each of these models it was proven that
they capture the Turing computable functions. Note that the
development of the modern computer stimulated the development of other
models such as register machines or Markov algorithms. More recently,
computational approaches in disciplines such as biology or physics,
resulted in bio-inspired and physics-inspired models such as Petri
nets or quantum Turing machines. A discussion of such models, however,
lies beyond the scope of this entry.</p>

<h3 id="GeneRecuFunc">4.1 General Recursive Functions</h3>

<p>
The original formulation of general
 <a href="../recursive-functions/index.html">recursive functions</a> can be
 found in G&ouml;del 1934, which built on a suggestion by Herbrand. In
 Kleene 1936 a simpler definition was given and in Kleene 1943 the
 standard form which uses the so-called minimization or
 \(\mu\)-operator was introduced. For more information, see the entry
 on
 <a href="../recursive-functions/index.html">recursive functions</a>.</p>
 

<p>
Church used the definition of general recursive functions to state his
thesis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>Church&rsquo;s thesis</strong> Every effectively calculable
function is general recursive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the context of recursive function one uses the notion of recursive
solvability and unsolvability rather than Turing computability and
uncomputability. This terminology is due to Post (1944).</p>

<h3 id="LDefi">4.2 &lambda;-Definability</h3>

<p>
Church&rsquo;s &lambda;-calculus has its origin in the papers (Church
1932, 1933) and which were intended as a logical foundation for
mathematics. It was Church&rsquo;s conviction at that time that this
different formal approach might avoid G&ouml;del incompleteness (Sieg
1997: 177). However, the logical system proposed by Church was proven
inconsistent by his two PhD students Stephen C. Kleene and Barkley
Rosser and so they started to focus on a subpart of that logic which
was basically the &lambda;-calculus. Church, Kleene and Rosser started
to &lambda;-define any calculable function they could think of and
quite soon Church proposed to define effective calculability in terms
of &lambda;-definability. However, it was only after Church, Kleene
and Rosser had established that general recursiveness and
&lambda;-definability are equivalent that Church announced his thesis
publicly and in terms of general recursive functions rather than
&lambda;-definability (Davis 1982; Sieg 1997).</p>

<p>
In &lambda;-calculus there are only two types of symbols. The three
primitive symbols &lambda;, (, ) also called the improper symbols, and
an infinite list of variables. There are three rules to define the
well-formed formulas of &lambda;-calculus, called
&lambda;-formulas.</p>

<ol>

<li>The &lambda;-formulas are first of all the variables
themselves.</li>

<li>If <strong>P</strong> is a &lambda;-formula containing <i>x</i> as
a free variable then \(\lambda x[\textbf{P}]\) is also a
&lambda;-formula. The &lambda;-operator is used to bind variables and
it thus converts an expression containing free variables into one that
denotes a function</li>

<li>If <strong>M</strong> and <strong>N</strong> are &lambda;-formulas
then so is {<strong>M</strong>}(<strong>N</strong>), where
{<strong>M</strong>}(<strong>N</strong>) is to be understood as the
application of the function <strong>M</strong> to
<strong>N</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The &lambda;-formulas, or well-formed formulas of &lambda;-calculus
are all and only those formulas that result from (repeated)
application of these three rules.</p>

<p>
There are three operations or rules of conversion. Let us define
\(\textrm{S}_{\mathbf{N}}^{x}\mathbf{M}|\) as standing for the formula
that results by substitution of <strong>N</strong> for <i>x</i> in
<strong>M</strong>.</p>

<ol>

<li><em>Reduction</em>. To replace any part \(\{\lambda x
\mathbf{[M]}\} (\mathbf{N})\) of a formula by
\(\textrm{S}_{\mathbf{N}}^{x}\mathbf{M}|\) provided that the bound
variables of <strong>M</strong> are distinct both from <i>x</i> and
from the free variables of <strong>N</strong>. For example \(\{\lambda
x [x^{2}]\}(2)\) reduces to \(2^{2}\)</li>

<li><em>Expansion</em> To replace any part
\(\textrm{S}_{\mathbf{N}}^{x}\mathbf{M}|\) of a formula by \(\{\lambda
x \mathbf{[M]}\} (\mathbf{N})\) provided that \(((\lambda x
\mathbf{M}) \mathbf{N})\) is well-formed and the bound variables of
<strong>M</strong> are distinct both from <i>x</i> and from the free
variables in <strong>N</strong>. For example, \(2^{2}\) can be
expanded to \(\{\lambda x [x^{2}]\}(2)\)</li>

<li><em>Change of bound variable</em> To replace any part
<strong>M</strong> of a formula by
\(\textrm{S}_{\textrm{y}}^{x}\mathbf{M}|\) provided that <i>x</i> is
not a free variable of <strong>M</strong> and <i>y</i> does not occur
in <strong>M</strong>. For example changing \(\{\lambda x [x^{2}]\}\)
to \(\{\lambda y [y^{2}]\}\)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Church introduces the following abbreviations to define the natural
numbers in &lambda;-calculus: </p> 

\[\begin{array}{l}
1 \rightarrow \lambda yx.yx,\\
2 \rightarrow \lambda yx.y(yx),\\
3 \rightarrow \lambda yx.y(y(yx)),\\
\ldots 
\end{array}\]

<p>
Using this definition, it is possible to &lambda;<em>-define</em>
functions over the positive integers. A function <i>F</i> of one
positive integer is &lambda;-definable if we can find a
&lambda;-formula <strong>F</strong>, such that if \(F(m) = n\) and
<strong>m</strong> and <strong>n</strong> are &lambda;-formulas
standing for the integers <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>, then the
&lambda;-formula \(\{\mathbf{F}\} (\mathbf{m})\) can be
<em>converted</em> to <strong>n</strong> by applying the conversion
rules of &lambda;-calculus. Thus, for example, the successor function
<i>S</i>, first introduced by Church, can be &lambda;-defined as
follows: </p> 

\[S \rightarrow \lambda abc. b(abc)\]

<p>
To give an example, applying <i>S</i> to the &lambda;-formula standing
for 2, we get: </p> 

\[\begin{align}
\big(\lambda abc. b(abc)\big ) \big(\lambda yx. y(yx)\big) \\ 
\rightarrow \lambda bc. b\big( \big(\lambda yx. y(yx)\big) bc\big)\\ 
\rightarrow \lambda bc. b\big( \big(\lambda x. b(bx)\big) c\big)\\ 
\rightarrow \lambda bc. b (b(bc))
\end{align}\]

<p>
Today, &lambda;-calculus is considered to be a basic model in the
theory of programming.</p>

<h3 id="PostProdSyst">4.3 Post Production Systems</h3>

<p>
Around 1920&ndash;21 Emil Post developed different but related types
of production systems in order to develop a syntactical form which
would allow him to tackle the decision problem for first-order logic.
One of these forms are Post canonical systems <i>C</i> which became
later known as Post production systems.</p>

<p>
A canonical system consists of a finite alphabet \(\Sigma\), a finite
set of initial words \(W_{0,0}\), \(W_{0,1}\),&hellip;, \(W_{0,n}\)
and a finite set of production rules of the following form:</p>

\[
\begin{array}{c}
g_{11}P_{i_{1}^{1}}g_{12}P_{i_{2}^{1}} \ldots g_{1m_{1}}P_{i^{1}_{m_{1}}}g_{1 {(m_{1} + 1)}}\\
g_{21}P_{i_{1}^{2}}g_{22}P_{i_{2}^{2}} \ldots g_{2m_{2}}P_{i^{2}_{m_{2}}}g_{2 {(m_{2} + 1)}}\\
&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;\\
g_{k1}P_{i_{1}^{k}}g_{k2}P_{i_{2}^{k}} \ldots g_{km_{k}}P_{i^{k}_{m_{k}}}g_{k {(m_{k} + 1)}}\\
\textit{produce}\\
g_{1}P_{i_{1}}g_{2}P_{i_{2}} \ldots g_{m}P_{i_{m}}g_{(m + 1)}\\
\end{array}
\]

<p>
The symbols <i>g</i> are a kind of metasymbols: they correspond to
actual sequences of letters in actual productions. The symbols
<i>P</i> are the operational variables and so can represent any
sequence of letters in a production. So, for instance, consider a
production system over the alphabet \(\Sigma = \{a,b\}\) with initial
word: </p> 

\[W_0 =  ababaaabbaabbaabbaba\]

<p>
and the following production rule:</p> 

\[
\begin{array}{c}
P_{1,1}bbP_{1,2}\\
\textit{produces}\\
P_{1,3}aaP_{1,4}\\
\end{array}
\]

<p>
Then, starting with \(W_0\), there are three possible ways to apply
the production rule and in each application the variables \(P_{1,i}\)
will have different values but the values of the g&rsquo;s are fixed.
Any set of finite sequences of words that can be produced by a
canonical system is called a <em>canonical set</em>.</p>

<p>
A special class of canonical forms defined by Post are normal systems.
A normal system <i>N</i> consists of a finite alphabet \(\Sigma\), one
initial word \(W_0 \in \Sigma^{\ast}\) and a finite set of production
rules, each of the following form:</p> 

\[
\begin{array}{c}
g_iP\\
\textit{produces}\\
Pg_i'\\
\end{array}
\]

<p>
Any set of finite sequences of words that can be produced by a normal
system is called a <em>normal set</em>. Post was able to show that for
any canonical set <i>C</i> over some alphabet \(\Sigma\) there is a
normal set <i>N</i> over an alphabet \(\Delta\) with \(\Sigma
\subseteq \Delta\) such that \(C = N \cap \Sigma^{\ast}\). It was his
conviction that (1) any set of finite sequences that can be generated
by finite means can be generated by canonical systems and (2) the
proof that for every canonical set there is a normal set which
contains it, which resulted in Post&rsquo;s thesis I:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<strong>Post&rsquo;s thesis I</strong> (Davis 1982) Every set of
finite sequences of letters that can be generated by finite processes
can also be generated by normal systems. More particularly, any set of
words on an alphabet \(\Sigma\) which can be generated by a finite
process is of the form \(N \cap \Sigma^{\ast}\), with <i>N</i> a
normal set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Post realized that &ldquo;[for the thesis to obtain its full
generality] a complete analysis would have to be made of all the
possible ways in which the human mind could set up finite processes
for generating sequences&rdquo; (Post 1965: 408) and it is quite
probable that the formulation 1 given in Post 1936 and which is almost
identical to Turing&rsquo;s machines is the result of such an
analysis.</p>

<p>
Post production systems became important formal devices in computer
science and, more particularly, formal language theory (Davis 1989;
Pullum 2011).</p>

<h3 id="Form1">4.4 Formulation 1</h3>

<p>
In 1936 Post published a short note from which one can derive
Post&rsquo;s second thesis (De Mol 2013):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<span><strong>Post&rsquo;s thesis II</strong></span> Solvability of a
problem in the intuitive sense coincides with solvability by
formulation 1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Formulation 1 is very similar to Turing machines but the
&lsquo;program&rsquo; is given as a list of directions which a human
worker needs to follow. Instead of a one-way infinite tape,
Post&rsquo;s &lsquo;machine&rsquo; consists of a two-way infinite
symbol space divided into boxes. The idea is that a worker is working
in this symbol space, being capable of a set of five primitive acts
(\(O_{1}\) mark a box, \(O_{2}\) unmark a box, \(O_{3}\) move one box
to the left, \(O_{4}\) move one box to the right, \(O_{5}\)
determining whether the box he is in is marked or unmarked), following
a finite set of directions \(d_{1}\),&hellip;, \(d_{n}\) where each
direction \(d_{i}\) always has one of the following forms:</p>

<ol type="A">

<li>Perform one of the operations (\(O_{1}\)&ndash;\(O_4\)) and go to
instruction \(d_{j}\)</li>

<li>Perform operation \(O_{5}\) and according as the box the worker is
in is marked or unmarked follow direction \(d_{j'}\) or
\(d_{j''}\).</li>

<li>Stop.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Post also defined a specific terminology for his formulation 1 in
order to define the solvability of a problem in terms of formulation
1. These notions are applicability, finite-1-process, 1-solution and
1-given. Roughly speaking these notions assure that a decision problem
is solvable with formulation 1 on the condition that the solution
given in the formalism always terminates with a correct solution.</p>

<h2 id="ImpaTuriMachCompScie">5. Impact of Turing Machines on Computer Science</h2>

<p>
Turing is today one of the most celebrated figures of computer
science. Many consider him as the father of computer science and the
fact that the main award in the computer science community is called
the Turing award is a clear indication of that (Daylight 2015). This
was strengthened by the Turing centenary celebrations from 2012, which
were largely coordinated by S. Barry Cooper. This resulted not only in
an enormous number of scientific events around Turing but also a
number of initiatives that brought the idea of Turing as the father of
computer science also to the broader public (Bullynck, Daylight, &amp;
De Mol 2015). Amongst Turing&rsquo;s contributions which are today
considered as pioneering, the 1936 paper on Turing machines stands out
as the one which has the largest impact on computer science. However,
recent historical research shows also that one should treat the impact
of Turing machines with great care and that one should be careful in
retrofitting the past into the present.</p>

<h3 id="ImpaTheoCompScie">5.1 Impact on Theoretical Computer Science</h3>

<p>
Today, the Turing machine and its theory are part of the theoretical
foundations of computer science. It is a standard reference in
research on foundational questions such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>What is an algorithm?</li>

<li>What is a computation?</li>

<li>What is a physical computation?</li>

<li>What is an efficient computation?</li>

<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is also one of the main models for research into a broad range of
subdisciplines in theoretical computer science such as: variant and
minimal models of computability, higher-order computability,
 <a href="../computational-complexity/index.html">computational complexity theory</a>,
 algorithmic information theory, etc. This significance of the Turing
machine model for theoretical computer science has at least two
historical roots.</p>

<p>
First of all, there is the continuation of the work in mathematical
logic from the 1920s and 1930s by people like Martin Davis&mdash;who
is a student of Post and Church&mdash;and Kleene. Within that
tradition, Turing&rsquo;s work was of course well-known and the Turing
machine was considered as the best model of computability given. Both
Davis and Kleene published a book in the 1950s on these topics (Kleene
1952; Davis 1958) which soon became standard references not just for
early computability theory but also for more theoretical reflections
in the late 1950s and 1960s on computing.</p>

<p>
Secondly, one sees that in the 1950s there is a need for theoretical
models to reflect on the new computing machines, their abilities and
limitations and this in a more systematic manner. It is in that
context that the theoretical work already done was picked up. One
important development is automata theory in which one can situate,
amongst others, the development of other machine models like the
register machine model or the Wang <i>B</i> machine model which are,
ultimately, rooted in Turing&rsquo;s and Post&rsquo;s machines; there
are the minimal machine designs discussed in
 <a href="#TuriMachModeComp">Section 5.2</a>;
 and there is the use of Turing machines in the context of what would
become the origins of formal language theory, viz the study of
different classes of machines with respect to the different
&ldquo;languages&rdquo; they can recognize and so also their
limitations and strengths. It are these more theoretical developments
that contributed to the establishment of
 <a href="../computational-complexity/index.html">computational complexity theory</a>
 in the 1960s. Of course, besides Turing machines, other models also
played and play an important role in these developments. Still, within
theoretical computer science it is mostly the Turing machine which
remains the model, even today. Indeed, when in 1965 one of the
founding papers of computational complexity theory (Hartmanis &amp;
Stearns 1965) is published, it is the multitape Turing machine which
is introduced as the standard model for the computer.</p>

<h3 id="TuriMachModeComp">5.2 Turing Machines and the Modern Computer</h3>

<p>
In several accounts, Turing has been identified not just as the father
of computer science but as the father of the modern computer. The
classical story for this more or less goes as follows: the blueprint
of the modern computer can be found in von Neumann&rsquo;s EDVAC
design and today classical computers are usually described as having a
so-called von Neumann architecture. One fundamental idea of the EDVAC
design is the so-called stored-program idea. Roughly speaking this
means the storage of instructions and data in the same memory allowing
the manipulation of programs as data. There are good reasons for
assuming that von Neumann knew the main results of Turing&rsquo;s
paper (Davis 1988). Thus, one could argue that the stored-program
concept originates in Turing&rsquo;s notion of the universal Turing
machine and, singling this out as the defining feature of the modern
computer, some might claim that Turing is the father of the modern
computer. Another related argument is that Turing was the first who
&ldquo;captured&rdquo; the idea of a general-purpose machine through
his notion of the universal machine and that in this sense he also
&ldquo;invented&rdquo; the modern computer (Copeland &amp; Proudfoot
2011). This argument is then strengthened by the fact that Turing was
also involved with the construction of an important class of computing
devices (the Bombe) used for decrypting the German Enigma code and
later proposed the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine)
which was explicitly identified as a kind of physical realization of
the universal machine by Turing himself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Some years ago I was researching on what might now be described as an
investigation of the theoretical possibilities and limitations of
digital computing machines. [&hellip;] Machines such as the ACE may be
regarded as practical versions of this same type of machine. (Turing
1947)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note however that Turing already knew the ENIAC and EDVAC designs and
proposed the ACE as a kind of improvement on that design (amongst
others, it had a simpler hardware architecture).</p>

<p>
These claims about Turing as the inventor and/or father of the
computer have been scrutinized by some historians of computing
(Daylight 2014; Haigh 2013; Haigh 2014; Mounier-Kuhn 2012), mostly in the wake of the Turing centenary and
this from several perspectives. Based on that research it is clear
that claims about Turing being the inventor of the modern computer
give a distorted and biased picture of the development of the modern
computer. At best, he is one of the many who made a contribution to
one of the several historical developments (scientific, political,
technological, social and industrial) which resulted, ultimately, in
(our concept of) the modern computer. Indeed, the &ldquo;first&rdquo;
computers are the result of a wide number of innovations and so are
rooted in the work of not just one but several people with diverse
backgrounds and viewpoints.</p>

<p>
In the 1950s then the (universal) Turing machine starts to become an
accepted model in relation to actual computers and is used as a tool
to reflect on the limits and potentials of general-purpose computers
by both engineers, mathematicians and logicians. More particularly,
with respect to machine designs, it was the insight that only a few
number of operations were required to built a general-purpose machine
which inspired in the 1950s reflections on minimal machine
architectures. Frankel, who (partially) constructed the MINAC stated
this as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One remarkable result of Turing&rsquo;s investigation is that he was
able to describe a single computer which is able to compute
<em>any</em> computable number. He called this machine a <em>universal
computer</em>. It is thus the &ldquo;best possible&rdquo; computer
mentioned.</p>

<p>
[&hellip;] This surprising result shows that in examining the question
of what problems are, in principle, solvable by computing machines, we
do not need to consider an infinite series of computers of greater and
greater complexity but may think only of a single machine. </p>

<p>
Even more surprising than the theoretical possibility of such a
&ldquo;best possible&rdquo; computer is the fact that it need not be
very complex. The description given by Turing of a universal computer
is not unique. Many computers, some of quite modest complexity,
satisfy the requirements for a universal computer. (Frankel 1956:
635)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The result was a series of experimental machines such as the MINAC,
TX-0 (Lincoln Lab) or the ZERO machine (van der Poel) which in their
turn became predecessors of a number of commercial machines. It is
worth pointing out that also Turing&rsquo;s ACE machine design fits
into this philosophy. It was also commercialized as the BENDIX G15
machine (De Mol, Bullynck, &amp; Daylight 2018).</p>

<p>
Of course, by minimizing the machine instructions, coding or
programming became a much more complicated task. To put it in
Turing&rsquo;s words who clearly realized this trade-off between code
and (hard-wired) instructions when designing the ACE: &ldquo;[W]e have
often simplified the circuit at the expense of the code&rdquo; (Turing
1947).
And indeed, one sees that with these early minimal designs, much
effort goes into developing more efficient coding strategies. It is
here that one can also situate one historical root of making the
connection between the universal Turing machine and the important
principle of the interchangeability between hardware and programs.</p>

<p>
Today, the universal Turing machine is by many still considered as the
main theoretical model of the modern computer especially in relation
to the so-called von Neumann architecture. Of course, other models
have been introduced for other architectures such as the Bulk
synchronous parallel model for parallel machines or the persistent
Turing machine for modeling interactive problems.</p>

<h3 id="TheoProg">5.3 Theories of Programming</h3>

<p>
The idea that any general-purpose machine can, in principle, be
modeled as a universal Turing machine also became an important
principle in the context of automatic programming in the 1950s
(Daylight 2015). In the machine design context it was the minimizing
of the machine instructions that was the most important consequence of
that viewpoint. In the programming context then it was about the idea
that one can built a machine that is able to
&lsquo;mimic&rsquo;&rsquo; the behavior of any other machine and so,
ultimately, the interchangeability between machine hardware and
language implementations. This is introduced in several forms in the
1950s by people like John W. Carr III and Saul Gorn&mdash;who were
also actively involved in the shaping of the <em>Association for
Computing Machinery (ACM)</em>&mdash;as the unifying theoretical idea
for automatic programming which indeed is about the (automatic)
&ldquo;translation&rdquo; of higher-order to lower-level, and,
ultimately, machine code. Thus, also in the context of programming,
the universal Turing machine starts to take on its foundational role
in the 1950s (Daylight 2015).</p>

<p>
Whereas the Turing machine is and was a fundamental theoretical model
delimiting what is possible and not on the general level, it did not
have a real impact on the syntax and semantics of programming
languages. In that context it were rather &lambda;-calculus and Post
production systems that had an effect (though also here one should be
careful in overstating the influence of a formal model on a
programming practice). In fact, Turing machines were often regarded as
machine models rather than as a model for programming:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Turing machines are not conceptually different from the automatic
computers in general use, but they are very poor in their control
structure. [&hellip;] Of course, most of the theory of computability
deals with questions which are not concerned with the particular ways
computations are represented. It is sufficient that computable
functions be represented somehow by symbolic expressions, e.g.,
numbers, and that functions computable in terms of given functions be
somehow represented by expressions computable in terms of the
expressions representing the original functions. However, a practical
theory of computation must be applicable to particular algorithms.
(McCarthy 1963: 37)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus one sees that the role of the Turing machine for computer science
should be situated rather on the theoretical level: the universal
machine is today by many still considered as the model for the modern
computer while its ability to mimic machines through its manipulation
of programs-as-data is one of the basic principles of modern
computing. Moreover, its robustness and naturalness as a model of
computability have made it the main model to challenge if one is
attacking versions of the so-called (physical) Church-Turing
thesis.</p>

<p>
Turing machines are more powerful than any device that can actually be
built, but they can be simulated both in software and hardware.</p>

<h4 id="SoftSimu">Software simulators</h4>

<p>
There are many Turing machine simulators available. Here are three
software simulators that use different technologies to implement
simulators using your browser.</p>

<ul>

 <li><a href="https://www.turing.org.uk/book/update/tmjavar.html" target="other">Andrew Hodges&rsquo; Turing Machine Simulator</a>
 (for limited number of machines)</li>

 <li><a href="http://ironphoenix.org/tril/tm/" target="other">Suzanne Britton&rsquo;s Turing Machine Simulator</a>
 (A Java Applet)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here is an application that you can run on the desktop (no endorsement
of these programs is implied).</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Isaiah Berlin</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
 The distinction between the human or cultural &lsquo;sciences&rsquo;
(as Berlin rarely called them in his own voice) &ndash; history,
philosophy, law and the various social &lsquo;sciences&rsquo;, such as
sociology, economics, anthropology etc. &ndash; had become a major
issue in nineteenth-century German philosophy. It continued to play an
important part in Germany in the earlier twentieth century, and also
became a significant issue in the English-speaking world, as a result
both of the influence of the Vienna Circle and of the emergence of the
social sciences as an increasingly self-confident and respected field
of study. Berlin&rsquo;s work, even though it invoked earlier figures
such as Giambattista Vico and J. G. Herder, closely resembled, and was
influenced by, attempts by such thinkers as Heinrich Rickert, Wilhelm
Dilthey and Max Weber to explain the nature of the
&lsquo;Geisteswissenschaften&rsquo;, the German word for the
humanities, usually translated as &lsquo;human sciences&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Berlin&rsquo;s use of the terms &lsquo;humanities&rsquo; and
&lsquo;humane studies&rsquo; is motivated by his insistence that their
aims and methods differ radically &ndash; a position that would be
masked by using the term &lsquo;human sciences&rsquo;, which is the
normal rendering of &lsquo;Geisteswissenschaften&rsquo;, as opposed to
&lsquo;Naturwissenschaften&rsquo;, the &lsquo;natural sciences&rsquo;.
The <em>locus classicus</em> for his distinction is &lsquo;The Divorce
between the Sciences and the Humanities&rsquo; (in Berlin 1979).
&lsquo;Humanities&rsquo; is by far his most frequent term, and the one
we adopt here except in historical contexts that make &lsquo;human
sciences&rsquo; more natural (Berlin&rsquo;s own practice). See also
note 6.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Berlin remained vague about the nature and origin of these concepts
and categories. Given his overall outlook, and hints scattered through
his writings, it seems likely that he believed they come mainly from
culture, education, ordinary experience and common social practices,
as well as philosophical theories. Some might be &lsquo;inbuilt&rsquo;
to the extent that they are influenced by certain basic needs or
tendencies intrinsic to human beings, or (like Kant&rsquo;s examples
of space and time) are required to make sense of the world and human
existence in ways comprehensible to our minds, given the manner in
which these are able to function. But Berlin believed that only a few
of the concepts and categories that we use are like this; many are
cultural or theoretical artefacts, subject to deliberate alteration or
change in response to experience. Examples of basic concepts that have
been transient include a teleological conception of nature &ndash;
that is, the view that everything that exists in the world exists for
a purpose, and is defined by the purpose that it pursues &ndash; and a
conception of human beings as wholly different from animals, as
opposed to a view that sees them as a (particularly well-developed)
kind of animal.</p>

<p>
As for the difference between concepts and categories, the passage in
<em>Historical Inevitability</em> quoted from in the text (2002b, 144,
note 1), Berlin&rsquo;s only fully explicit account of the distinction
between these two types of element in the structure of our thought,
appears to show that categories (Berlin&rsquo;s examples here are
&lsquo;the three dimensions and infinite extent of ordinary perceptual
space, the irreversibility of temporal processes, the multiplicity and
countability of material objects&rsquo;) are more capacious,
unspecific and abstract than concepts. However, the boundary between
the two is left open, and it is unclear at what point it is crossed in
the sequence of increasingly specific and varied examples Berlin
gives: colours, shapes, (gustatory) tastes, &lsquo;the uniformities on
which the sciences are based&rsquo;, &lsquo;the categories of
value&rsquo;, &lsquo;moral standards&rsquo;, &lsquo;rules of
etiquette&rsquo;, subjective preferences of taste. Concepts are thus
perhaps related to categories somewhat as species to genus, though
Berlin does not put it in exactly these terms, and the evidence for
his view does not point to any precise, or consistent, position. For
other, suggestive but less discriminatory, passages about categories
and/or concepts see e.g. 1951, 6&ndash;7; 1978b, 9&ndash;11,
205&ndash;6, 217&ndash;20, 324; 2000a, 57&ndash;60; 1979, 130.</p>

<p>
Berlin did not offer a definitive statement or theory about concepts
and categories, not only because to do so involved doing the sort of
philosophical work from which he shrank, but also because he thought
that different concepts and categories differed in their origins,
function, necessity, plasticity etc. For him, such concepts and
categories were simply facts about the way we think, which were
philosophically significant, but best approached in historical or
psychological terms, rather than as fixed Kantian transcendental ideas
(that is, ideas which are wholly prior to experience, and necessary
conditions for any kind of knowledge).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Berlin believed that philosophers make two kinds of contribution to
the consideration of philosophical questions. The first is to
reformulate these questions by suggesting a new outlook on the world
that liberates the intellect from the mental cramp that has caused the
problem. The second, critical rather than creative, contribution is to
provide a violent shock to dogmatic assumptions about the solutions to
philosophical questions, thus creating new problems and inspiring
further thought (1996, 73). For a philosopher to do either of these
required considerable force of character, and a certain amount of
exaggeration and simplification, as well as self-confidence and
persistence. Later in life Berlin described himself as a historian of
ideas rather than as a philosopher, despite the fact that his account
of the nature of philosophy emphasised philosophy&rsquo;s historical
dimension. This reflected his (high) standards &ndash; which he did
not believe himself to meet &ndash; for considering someone a genuine
or significant philosopher.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 The topics that dominated Berlin&rsquo;s early work on philosophy
were the doctrines of verification and phenomenalism, derived from the
Vienna Circle by way of A. J. Ayer. In the 1930s Berlin and his
philosophical peers at Oxford were occupied primarily with the
philosophy of knowledge, especially perception: How do, or can, we
know things, and what does it mean when we say we know something? They
argued that these questions were tied up with the use of language, and
the evaluation of the <em>meaning</em> of statements with questions
such as &lsquo;How do we know what a statement means, or if it has any
meaning at all?&rsquo; Verificationism held that the meaning of a
statement was to be found in the way in which it could be verified; if
like moral, religious or metaphysical statements it couldn&rsquo;t be
verified &ndash; that is, shown to be true or false &ndash; it had no
meaning as a statement of fact, but was merely an expression of
personal taste, or meaningless. Phenomenalism held that all our
knowledge comes from our sense impressions: we can know only sense
data, i.e. the deliverances of perceptual experience. Anything not
founded on sensory experience is nonsense.</p>

<p>
Berlin regarded these doctrines as beneficial in clearing away
confusions and exposing errors. But, while he believed that the world
of human experience is all that we can know, he rejected verifiability
as the only, or the most plausible, criterion for judging beliefs or
hypotheses, as well as the linked phenomenalist view that statements
about the world were only meaningful if they referred to actual or
possible sensory experience. Against these views, he maintained
throughout his life that many statements that could not be directly
verified by empirical observation, or reduced to the description of
direct sensory experience, were nevertheless clearly meaningful.
Examples were statements about &lsquo;the past and the future, and
absent objects, and other persons, and unrealised possibilities, and
general and hypothetical judgements&rsquo; (1978b, 102). He also
argued that there are certain quasi-conceptual universal truths that
are not empirical in the normal sense, because we cannot &lsquo;think
them away&rsquo;, i.e. imagine them to be false; nor are they
analytic, because they do not follow straightforwardly from the
meanings of the terms they contain. Several examples are given in his
paper on &lsquo;Synthetic A Priori Propositions&rsquo;, for instance
&lsquo;Nothing can look to an observer yellow and blue all over in the
same place at the same time&rsquo; and &lsquo;You cannot be in two
places [at the same time]&rsquo; (1951, 8, 1, 5). Of another example
drawn from the properties of colours, &lsquo;This pink [shade] is more
like this vermilion than it is like this black&rsquo; (1937a, 76), he
observed: &lsquo;I was convinced that my proposition was, if not
strictly a priori, self-evidently true, and that its contradictory was
not intelligible&rsquo; (2002a, 3&ndash;4). Armed with such examples,
he warned his colleagues that the principle of verification would lead
to untenable consequences, and would, if not abandoned or considerably
revised, breed new fallacies in the place of those it had dispelled
(1978b, 15).</p>

<p>
Berlin&rsquo;s approach in these early years was shaped by the
emphasis on the analysis of the meaning of words then being championed
by his friend J. L. Austin. As Berlin explained at the time:</p>

<blockquote>
Words are examined by philosophers for the purpose of discovering
whether, as they are used in successful communication, they tend to
exhibit or obscure some characteristic by which one type of fact
differs from another, or alternatively suggest falsely the existence
of distinctions which direct inspection of experience fails to reveal.
This is done because inattention to either [possibility] tends to lead
to systematic confusion and error, not necessarily in the use of
words, which, being conventional and intended for common practice and
not the convenience of philosophers, is rightly not altered by their
criticisms, but in the accurate discrimination and description of
irreducible types of experience. (1937a, 102)
</blockquote>

 The term derives from the Ionian philosophers, the founders of
Western philosophy, such as Thales, who offered different theories
about the composition of the universe; a hallmark of these theories
was the attempt to discover a single substance out of which everything
else is composed.</p>
</div> <!--There is no note 6-->

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Berlin acknowledged that there were certain &lsquo;human
sciences&rsquo; that sought to emulate the aims of the natural
sciences, by trying to discover regularities in human behaviour, and
refining them into explanatory laws. Berlin was very sceptical about
such disciplines &ndash; economics, sociology, psychology among them
&ndash; but acknowledged that such scientific studies of human
behaviour had some value. He maintained, though, that history remained
fundamentally different from the natural sciences in its aims and
techniques. Other approaches to the study of human beings may seek to
abstract from a large number of stable similarities and recurrences in
human behaviour across many different cases, in order to construct
useful ideal models which may help us better understand such
behaviour. But history is irreducibly different: it is concerned with
exploring and understanding individual cases as individual, that is,
unique and non-recurrent. It is richer in description and less
rigorous in explanation. Other human sciences necessarily abstract:
their descriptive power is extensive rather than intensive, their
descriptions thinner. The subject-matter of history, on the other
hand, &lsquo;involves a &ldquo;thick&rdquo; texture of criss-crossing,
constantly changing and melting conscious and unconscious beliefs and
assumptions&rsquo; (1978b, 182). History is an &lsquo;amalgam, a rich
brew composed of apparently disparate ingredients&rsquo;. In looking
for satisfactory and satisfying historical accounts, we look for
&lsquo;something full enough and concrete enough to meet our
conception of public life [&hellip;], seen from as many points of view
and at as many levels as possible, including as many components,
factors, aspects as the widest and deepest knowledge, the greatest
analytical power, insight, imagination can present&rsquo;.
&lsquo;Historical explanation is [&hellip;] arrangement of the
discovered facts in patterns which satisfy us because they accord with
life &ndash; the variety of human experience and activity &ndash; as
we know it and can imagine it&rsquo; (ibid., 171&ndash;3). The
historian&rsquo;s purpose &lsquo;is to paint a portrait &hellip; which
&hellip; seeks to capture the unique patterns and peculiar
characteristics of its particular subject&rsquo;: to paint a portrait,
rather than take an X-ray image (ibid., 164).</p>
</div>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Berlin took up the problem of free will and determinism, and the
related topic of the role of individual choice and agency in history,
both indirectly, through an examination of Leo Tolstoy&rsquo;s
philosophy of history (originally published 1951, republished with
additions as <em>The Hedgehog and the Fox</em> 1953 and in 1978a and
1997a), and in <em>Historical Inevitability</em> (1954; republished in
2002b). These questions had, however, no doubt preoccupied him since
his work on Marx in the mid 1930s, when he would have encountered them
in the form of Plekhanov&rsquo;s defence of historical determinism.
Plekhanov&rsquo;s work served as a challenge to Berlin&rsquo;s belief
in the historical importance of individuals, and his conception of
morality, based as it was on the human capacity for choice.</p>

 The influence on Berlin of Soviet Communism is obvious here; but
while this was the main target for his attack, his critique could also
be, and was, applied to Nazism, and even to the complacent and
inhumane &lsquo;managerial&rsquo; policies of capitalist Western
democracies. See Berlin 2002b, 92&ndash;3, 337&ndash;44; Cherniss
2013, 58&ndash;9, 88&ndash;111, 118&ndash;20.</p>

 Apart from one 1962 essay on ancient Greek individualism (first
published 1998, republished in 2002b), he devoted scant attention to
the history of the ideas in the ancient world. As for the Middle Ages,
while Berlin could admit that the period might have been superior to
what followed in some respects &ndash; greater public order,
intellectual security, social cohesion etc. &ndash; he regarded it as
by and large an intellectually blank period, because of the very
stability and conservatism of its intellectual life. Berlin&rsquo;s
interest in Renaissance thought was greater, though it yielded only
one essay &ndash; a suitably original and influential examination of
&lsquo;The Originality of Machiavelli&rsquo; (1972; republished in
1979 and 1997a).</p>
</div>

 Berlin&rsquo;s writings on the history of ideas can be classified in
several different ways. One is geographical, yielding as a first
category works on Russian intellectual and cultural history,
particularly of the nineteenth century; here belong his several essays
on Herzen, his two studies of Tolstoy, his pieces on Turgenev,
Belinsky and Plekhanov, as well as those on Russian populism and the
theme of artistic commitment in Russian thought (most of them included
in 1978a; see also 1996 and 2000a). The other geographical category
covers the history of ideas in Western Europe, primarily focusing on
Germany, but also encompassing France and Italy (with glances at
England and Switzerland). (A third category comprises Berlin&rsquo;s
essays on modern, secular Jewish thinkers.) It is also natural to
divide his historical essays into portraits of individuals (in
addition to those already named in this note, Fichte, Hamann, Hegel,
Herder, Moses Hess, Kant, Maistre, Marx, Meinecke, Mill, Rousseau,
Saint-Simon, Sorel, Verdi, Vico and others) and examinations of larger
epochs, movements and themes &ndash; most notably the Enlightenment
and the Counter-Enlightenment, the Romantic movement and
nineteenth-century socialism.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Berlin derived this interpretation of the Enlightenment&rsquo;s
assumptions and inconsistencies largely from Plekhanov&rsquo;s works
on the history of materialism.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Berlin focused, in his accounts of the Enlightenment, on the radical,
materialist, naturalist, proto-Utilitarian element among the
<em>philosophes</em> &ndash; Holbach, Helv&eacute;tius, La Mettrie and
the more mild-mannered Condorcet &ndash; though he acknowledged, and
sought to encompass, other figures from the movement &ndash;
Montesquieu, Voltaire, Hume, Kant (the last two seen, however, as
forerunners of the Enlightenment&rsquo;s critics, however
unintentionally on their part), and sometimes Rousseau.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 These included the ultramontane Catholic reactionary Joseph de
Maistre (whom he portrayed as a precursor of Fascism and the author of
a disturbingly compelling, dark and savage vision of human life as
essentially characterised by violence and terror); the Italian
philosopher and critic of scientism Giambattista Vico; and
pre-Romantic German opponents of Enlightenment rationalism and
universalism such as J. G. Hamann and J. G. Herder.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 The term &lsquo;rationalism&rsquo; (and its cognate
&lsquo;rationalist&rsquo;) is used by Berlin &ndash; as by many others
&ndash; in multiple, not clearly or consistently distinguished, ways.
The ambiguity is not incidental, but is very much woven into &ndash;
and perhaps constitutes a serious problem in &ndash; Berlin&rsquo;s
account of the history of ideas. He consistently identifies the
Enlightenment with &lsquo;rationalism&rsquo; without acknowledging
that many Enlightenment thinkers, as empiricists, rejected a central
tenet of rationalism understood as a philosophical doctrine precisely
set against empiricism (let us call this anti-empiricist rationalism),
holding that the world can be made sense of correctly only through the
use of pure reason, because reality perfectly conforms to the dictates
of reason (see Berlin 2002b, 317). Berlin does sometimes use the term
in this way (see e.g. Berlin 1978b, 74, 116, 89; Berlin 1990, 5;
Berlin 2002b, 238). But he also sometimes uses it interchangeably with
what we might more accurately call materialism (so that many
&lsquo;rationalists&rsquo; might also be empiricists; see Berlin
1978b, 10).</p>

<p>
More broadly (or sweepingly), &lsquo;rationalism&rsquo; for Berlin is
often the larger anti-empiricist metaphysical view just identified. It
is also the related ethical view that identifies freedom, or goodness,
or flourishing with the acceptance of and conformity to what is
rational, that is, the rational laws or principles governing reality
(see Berlin 1990, 4; Berlin 2002b, 188&ndash;90, 197&ndash;9,
258&ndash;9, 265, 277&ndash;8; it should be stressed that in these
passages Berlin does not distinguish epistemological, metaphysical and
ethical dimensions of &lsquo;rationalism&rsquo;, but treats these as
identical &ndash; so that what we identify as &lsquo;ethical&rsquo;
rationalism here is said by Berlin to be &lsquo;the metaphysical heart
of rationalism&rsquo;). He further identified such rationalism closely
with monism, writing that monism lay &lsquo;at the heart of much
metaphysical rationalism&rsquo; (Berlin 2002b, 213; see also ibid.,
42, 278). He also sometimes uses &lsquo;rationalism&rsquo; to refer to
a psychological doctrine, a view (which he regards as unrealistically
optimistic and shallow) of human beings as actually or potentially
motivated primarily by rational considerations (see e.g. Berlin 2018,
274&ndash;5); or to what we here term &lsquo;scientism&rsquo; &ndash;
the belief that all of experience could be grasped through the methods
of the (natural) sciences, and (related to this) that all problems
could be solved through the application of scientific knowledge or
expertise (see e.g. Berlin 2002b, 111, 130, 195).</p>

<p>
Berlin rejected all these forms of rationalism. But he was also
anxious to distance himself from what he called
&lsquo;anti-rationalism&rsquo;. In this context, he seems to have been
referring to a radical rejection of any attempts to make rational
sense of the world &ndash; to render experience rationally
intelligible, predictable and consistent (see e.g. Berlin 2002b, 27,
66&ndash;8). Berlin may have classed himself among those he called
&lsquo;troubled rationalists&rsquo; (1978b, 201): he retained an
attachment to &ndash; even if he also entertained doubts about &ndash;
the larger tendency of &lsquo;critical rationalism&rsquo;, which
continued to hold on to &lsquo;a cautious and highly qualified
optimism about the moral and intellectual future of the human
race&rsquo; (Berlin 2002b, 88), and rested hope for the future on
belief in the capacity of human intelligence both to achieve greater
self-understanding, and to alleviate social and material problems of
human life. His attacks on various forms of &lsquo;rationalism&rsquo;
were themselves motivated by a desire to understand the world, so as
(in part) to be able to act rationally; this was very much within the
tradition of the larger, looser, more encompassing
&lsquo;rationalism&rsquo; of which he sometimes wrote.</p>

<p>
Berlin&rsquo;s multiply ambiguous use of this key term is an object
lesson in the dangers of falling in with an established pattern of
misleading terminology, the kind of danger traded on, according to
Berlin, by enemies of freedom who exploit ambiguities in the term
&lsquo;liberty&rsquo; (or &lsquo;freedom&rsquo;) to commit the
&lsquo;monstrous impersonation&rsquo; of freedom by its opposite
(2002b, 180).</p>

 Berlin used the terms &lsquo;values&rsquo;, &lsquo;ideals&rsquo;,

&lsquo;demands&rsquo; and &lsquo;goals&rsquo; more or less &ndash; but

 Why &lsquo;absolute&rsquo;? Since Berlin&rsquo;s solution to the
problem of conflicting values is to establish compromises, trade-offs,
between them, it cannot be said that the claims they make are absolute
in the sense that they must be met in full, without concessions to
other values. So what is he getting at here? &lsquo;Absolute&rsquo; is
a polysemous term that deserves to be used with care.
Characteristically, he offers no formal definition(s), using the term
in different senses in different contexts, from which we have to do
our best to tease out his implicit meanings.</p>


<p>
It seems most consistent with his most frequent usage elsewhere to say
that he regards (at least some) human values as &lsquo;absolute&rsquo;
in the sense that they are irreducibly distinct ends-in-themselves,
valuable each in its own right, and not just in terms of some other
value (or super-value). Thus he holds, for example (and against
utilitarianism), that justice, liberty, enlightenment and so on are
each <em>sui generis</em>, valuable intrinsically rather than
instrumentally, i.e. not just because and in so far as they conduce to
the super-value of happiness (though they may do this too). From this
it follows that these values are, by virtue of this
&lsquo;absoluteness&rsquo;, or distinctness of intrinsic value,
<em>incommensurable</em>: that is, they cannot be weighed or measured
against one another on a single scale, in terms of a single
metric.</p>

<p>
Berlin also frequently suggests that these values are
&lsquo;absolute&rsquo; in another, related sense, close to that of
&lsquo;universal&rsquo;: their claims on us are non-relative, not only
to other values (liberty does not derive its value solely from its
contribution to happiness), but also to circumstances (liberty does
not derive its value from being part of or contributing to a certain
way of life, or allowing for success in a particular situation; it is
valuable for all human beings, as such). </p>

<p>
Yet Berlin does also use &lsquo;absolute&rsquo; in a number of places
to indicate inviolablity or un-cancellability: in this sense, for a
value to be &lsquo;absolute&rsquo; means that it cannot be overruled
(see e.g. Berlin 2002b, 211, where he speaks of &lsquo;an absolute
right to refuse to behave inhumanly&rsquo;). This understanding of the
absoluteness of values is harder to square with the idea of balances
or compromises between values. Instead Berlin acknowledges, or
insists, that when such balancing or compromising occurs, there is a
genuine loss or sacrifice: we may, for instance, sacrifice a certain
degree of liberty for the sake of equality or security, but we should
acknowledge that, in doing so, we are sacrificing something that
remains valuable, and that therefore this sacrifice is to be regretted
(this view is developed in Walzer 1973, and the contributions by
Thomas Nagel, Charles Taylor and Bernard Williams in Lilla, Dworkin
and Silvers 2001) .</p>

 Berlin writes:</p>

<blockquote>
I am reading the philosopher Malebranche who says that a better world
than ours might exist but it would be far more complicated, &amp; God
being good, &amp; desiring to give us a world not wholly
unintelligible produced this compromise between simplicity &amp;
goodness, which are he thinks (odd interesting view!) incompatible.
Hence our miserable makeshift universe. Indeed if our universe is the
best of all possible worlds what must the others be like?
</blockquote>

<p>
This seems to go somewhat beyond the passages in Malebranche 1680
cited in the text, so there may be other relevant passages that we
have yet to locate.</p>

 Most prominent among these other pluralist thinkers have been George
Crowder, William Galston, John Gray, Stuart Hampshire, John Kekes,
Steven Lukes, Thomas Nagel, Joseph Raz, Michael Walzer and Bernard
Williams; positions advanced at times by Robert Nozick, John Rawls,
Richard Rorty and Charles Taylor in some ways resemble pluralism, but
are difficult to categorise in relation to it.</p>

 Berlin did not respond to Leo Strauss&rsquo;s direct and powerful
attack except in a private letter to Harry Jaffa in 1992 (2015, online
supplement); he did respond to Arnaldo Momigliano&rsquo;s criticism
(Berlin 1990, 73&ndash;94), which made the pluralism = relativism
accusation through an examination of Berlin&rsquo;s interpretations of
Vico and Herder; and he was anxious to draw a sharp distinction
between relativism and pluralism in his later work. Nevertheless, the
charge continues to be made by critics, and rejected by supporters, of
Berlin&rsquo;s pluralism. For some recent treatments, not discussed in
the main text, see Barry 2001 (highly critical), Connolly 2005,
Ferrell 2008, Moore 2009, Crowder 2020, Lyons 2020.</p>

 One of the best-known forms of relativism is cultural relativism
&ndash; the view that all values emerge from particular cultures, and
are valid within and for those cultures, but not necessarily for
others. Berlin sometimes appears to say this; he also seems sometimes
to endorse, and sometimes to disavow, a major assumption underlying
most versions of cultural relativism, namely, a holistic conception of
culture. This regards cultures as unified and wholly separate
entities, webs in which each belief is bound together with every other
belief, and within which members cannot disentangle their beliefs one
from another, rejecting some, retaining others, judging each
critically and separately. It remains controversial whether
Berlin&rsquo;s view of culture was holistic, and, if so, to what
extent and in what way; but it has been maintained &ndash; most
notably and persistently by Steven Lukes &ndash; that pluralism can be
rescued from the shoals of relativism if the pluralist rejects a
holistic conception of culture, which, Lukes maintains, is
fundamentally mistaken (Lukes 1994, 1995, 1998, 2001a). Lukes&rsquo;s
critique of holism, and his de-coupling of pluralism from holism, are
plausible; it does not however necessarily follow that not accepting
holism allows the pluralist to believe consistently in universal
standards or values (conflicting though these may be) transcending all
cultures. But the rejection of a holistic view of culture does remove
a major obstacle to a belief that certain values transcend cultural
differences, by suggesting that cultures aren&rsquo;t wholly
self-contained, closed off and unconnected. If we add the wide
recurrence of certain beliefs in different cultures, some at least of
them justifiable in terms of human welfare, belief in a universal
human nature and universal values underlying cultural variety,
conflict and dissent is one step closer.</p>

 Gray has sometimes presented his critique of liberalism as a critique
only of a certain sort of liberalism, or strain within the liberal
tradition, and has opposed to this another, better, more pluralistic
liberalism (see Gray 2002); at other times, he has presented his
critique as a more wholesale indictment of liberalism as such (see
e.g. Gray 1993, 1995, 1998).</p>

<p>
Gray&rsquo;s arguments can be summarised in vastly simplified form as
three main propositions about liberalism. The first of these is that
liberalism is absolutist and monistic: it is based on assigning an
absolute moral/political priority to liberty as the paramount
political value (it should be emphasised that Berlin explicitly
rejects such a claim). If values really are incommensurable, then this
is unallowable. The second is that liberalism is one value-system or
way of life among many. If pluralism is conceived of in terms of ways
of life, value-systems, cultures etc., rather than in terms of
individual values, then the conclusion would be that liberalism is
just one of these many valid but conflicting ways of life, with no
claim to privilege. Therefore, liberals living in liberal societies
are free to be liberal and pursue liberal values; but they have no
right to impose their views on others, or regard themselves as
superior or their way of doing things as preferable. Finally, Gray
charges that liberalism by its nature has historically been a
universalist doctrine &ndash; that is, it has denied this last
proposition, and indeed claimed to be superior to other forms of life,
for all people, everywhere, at all times. Therefore, if pluralism is
accepted, and liberals accept liberalism as just one form of life
among many, then one of the central goals of traditional liberalism
must be abandoned. (All these propositions can be challenged from
within Berlin&rsquo;s <em>oeuvre</em>.)</p>

 Galston has argued that pluralism and liberalism are compatible if
neither is seen as a fully comprehensive or encompassing doctrine, and
has sought to suggest what a politics that is both truly pluralist and
truly liberal would look like. Crowder, in probably the most
systematic and careful discussion of the topic to date, has sought to
show that Gray&rsquo;s account of value pluralism incorporates a
number of assumptions and conclusions that make his position closer to
relativism than to a truly objective value pluralism; that genuine
value pluralism is wholly consistent with a belief in a core or
minimum of universal human values, as well as non-monistic and
non-quantitative comparison of and choice between values based on
practical reason; and that value pluralism&rsquo;s recognition of both
genuine moral variety and a basic, minimal standard of human decency
supports liberalism. Crowder has further suggested that liberalism and
value pluralism are mutually supporting, in so far as effective moral
reasoning under conditions of value pluralism will require the
exercise of certain virtues (such as generosity, broad-mindedness,
flexibility, moderation and attentiveness to values, situations and
persons) which for him are characteristically liberal or promoted by
liberalism; and value pluralism gives us reason to prefer social
orders in which there is a greater variety of realised or realisable
values, and a greater opportunity for individuals to choose among
those values &ndash; that is, characteristically, liberal societies
(see Crowder 2002). Others who have contributed significantly to this
debate include Hans Blokland (1999), Jason Ferrell (2009), Jeffrey
Friedman (1997), Amy Gutmann (1999), Ira Katznelson (1994), Charles
Larmore (1994), Steven Lukes (1989, 1994), Pratap B. Mehta (1997),
Matthew Moore (2009), Ella Myers (2010), Jonathan Riley (2001, 2002
and in M&uuml;ller 2019), Robert Talisse (2010), Michael Walzer
(1995), Daniel Weinstock (1997) and Alex Zakaras (2013). There is a
significant review of earlier literature on the topic by Albert Dzur
(1998), a collection of essays exploring the political implications of
pluralism (Baghramian and Ingram, 2000), and a recent overview and
restatement by Crowder (2019). So far these works &ndash; in
particular, Galston and Crowder&rsquo;s volumes &ndash; seem not to
have exhausted the pluralism/liberalism debate.</p>

 The distinction goes back at least to Kant, and it (or something like
it) had appeared in the works of T. H. Green, Bernard Bosanquet and
Boris Chicherin, and had more recently been used by Guido de Ruggiero,
R. G. Collingwood, John Petrov Plamenatz and Dorothy Fosdick, among
others; Berlin himself acknowledged Benjamin Constant (who spoke of
&lsquo;the liberty of the ancients&rsquo; as against that of the
&lsquo;moderns&rsquo;: see FIB2 53&ndash;4, 230&ndash;3) as the main
influence on his thinking. His conception of positive and negative
liberty may also owe something to Rousseau&rsquo;s distinction between
the liberty of the man and that of the citizen, and to the more
general distinction among earlier theorists, of whom Rousseau was the
most prominent, between natural and moral liberty.</p>

<div id="note-24">

 Berlin cites Stoicism&rsquo;s preaching of self-discipline and
renunciation as a way of resisting, and remaining uncorrupted by,
overwhelmingly powerful earthly authorities; Rousseau&rsquo;s
insistence that the only just society is one in which people retain
their liberty by transmuting it from the individual self-governance of
solitary selves in a state of nature to the collective self-rule of
the people by the people, so that obedience to the civil authority is
really obedience to oneself, and thus freedom rather than subjection;
and finally Kant&rsquo;s philosophy of moral autonomy, whereby the
individual&rsquo;s inalienable freedom and dignity lie in the fact
that the individual acts in accordance with a self-given moral law,
and is therefore recognised as a freely choice-making being, dependent
on no one and nothing else. Berlin has considerable sympathy for this
last, Kantian, outlook, though he believed that it had inspired
profound errors. He acknowledged that the Stoic ideal was admirable,
but charged that it rested on a misuse of words: to attain
independence through a renunciation of those desires that make one
prey to the domination of others might be sublime, and it might be the
best that one can do in certain circumstances; but the fact remains
that one is then less free than one would be otherwise, in that there
are constraints preventing one from acting with true freedom.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 It has been argued that the former part of Berlin&rsquo;s argument
here is somewhat stronger than the latter, because although the
conflict of values may mean that the making of choices is an
inescapable and even significant part of life, this is not, in itself,
a reason for embracing the making of choices as something valuable and
central to both dignity and fulfilment. Indeed, if making choices
involves the tragic losses that Berlin claims it sometimes does, one
may be inclined to try to escape the painful and difficult need to
choose, rather than proudly embracing it. Some have made this point by
claiming that Berlin turns an &lsquo;is&rsquo; into an
&lsquo;ought&rsquo;, in contravention of Hume&rsquo;s law forbidding
the derivation of values from facts. However, the value of choice is
not derived from its inevitability, but from its role in forming our
lives and identities. Berlin writes:</p>

<blockquote>
The world that we encounter in ordinary experience is one in which we
are faced with choices between ends equally ultimate [&hellip;], the
realisation of some of which must inevitably involve the sacrifice of
others. Indeed, it is because this is their situation that men place
such immense value upon the freedom to choose; for if they had an
assurance that in some perfect state, realisable by men on earth, no
ends pursued by them would ever be in conflict, the necessity and
agony of choice would disappear, and with it the central importance of
the freedom to choose. (2002b, 213&ndash;14)
</blockquote>

<p>
The grounds for valuing freedom of choice may not be fully spelt out
here, but it is not hard to read between the lines. Our ultimate ends
are of the greatest importance to our welfare, and are therefore
imbued with value; the pluralist&rsquo;s value choices are a vehicle
of self-creation; they cannot be delegated to experts, because no
single choice is uniquely right, and the judgement that is needed to
make one choice rather than another has to be reached autonomously by
the situated individual, who alone knows from inside the full context
in which a choice has to be made, and is a position to take
responsibility for that choice. This is why choosing is a valuable
activity in and for itself, a central, formative part of human life,
independently of its unavoidability.</p>

 Berlin&rsquo;s Zionism has been the subject of controversy. Some
critics have complained that it led him to turn a blind eye to
injustice and tacitly approve of Israeli chauvinism. This was not so.
Berlin was a liberal and humane Zionist; he believed in the justice
and necessity of a Jewish homeland, but also opposed violence,
nationalist aggression and chauvinism wherever they appeared. Indeed,
his aversion to political radicalism led him to support the moderate,
pro-British Chaim Weizmann against more assertive Zionist leaders such
as David Ben-Gurion in the 1940s, even when it became apparent that
Ben-Gurion&rsquo;s strategy was likely to be more effective than
Weizmann&rsquo;s in establishing a Jewish state. Later in life Berlin
was a quiet but firm, and at times privately vehement, critic of the
Likud bloc and of Israeli policy in the West Bank and Gaza, and a
supporter of the Peace Now movement and a &lsquo;two-state
solution&rsquo; to the Israeli&ndash;Palestinian conflict (2015,
568).</p>

 The insensitive and authoritarian rule of managerial bureaucrats
&ndash; those whom Stalin, in one of Berlin&rsquo;s favourite
quotations, called &lsquo;engineers of human souls&rsquo; (see e.g.
2002b, 82, note 1) &ndash; particularly worried Berlin throughout the
1950s, when most of his work on political judgement was written

 While Herzen&rsquo;s combination of ironic wit, moral passion and
vivacity naturally appealed to Berlin, it may seem strange that the
apparently complaisant British academic should have identified himself
with the wayward Russian aristocrat turned wandering revolutionary, or
that the very embodiment of cautious, sceptical and moderate
liberalism should have regarded a radical malcontent, the father of
Russian agrarian socialism, as a political guide.</p>

<p>
In fact, Herzen was a deeply ambivalent revolutionary, and Berlin,
while certainly every inch the liberal, was a less impassive and more
radical thinker than is sometimes recognised. The two men shared a
passion for liberty, a suspicion of authority, an opposition to both
injustice and intellectual complacency. However, what Berlin seized on
in Herzen was the latter&rsquo;s opposition to &ndash; and occasional
passionate denunciation of &ndash; the doctrine of historical
inevitability, and the political ethics to which this attack was
joined.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>
 This paints with a broad &ndash; not to say distorting &ndash; brush.
We may, while still simplifying wildly, distinguish two traditions or
positions within political thought that are often associated with the
term &lsquo;political realism&rsquo;. One is a tradition of realism in
the theorising of international relations, a tradition defined by a
shared conviction that (1) states in the international system are
motivated primarily by a competitive quest for power &ndash; or for
security from the predations of other states (which is understood to
require the acquisition of power); (2) the rulers of states should
take the interest or well-being of their state, understood as its
relative power and security, as the primary objective of their policy;
(3) states (or their rulers) will seek to secure their authority over
the territories and subjects under their power, subordinating or
eliminating any competitors; and (4) they are right to do so. Politics
and policy, on this view, are defined by the goal of securing and
extending the power of the state; the state is the highest of values
and most basic of political units, and thus has analytic and normative
primacy in thinking about politics; (sometimes violent) competition is
the basic mode, and power the central objective, of political
action.</p>

<p>
The second form of (doctrinal or theoretical) &lsquo;realism&rsquo;,
which is commonly found in political theory, begins from a picture of
human nature and social dynamics as dominated by competitiveness,
vanity, fearfulness, aggression, selfishness and imperfect
rationality. This view sees politics as naturally, inevitably
conflictual, and political authority or order as resting on some
combination of force, fear and irrational belief, rather than on
consent or moral conviction. (The preceding draws on Cherniss 2018.)
On the history of realism, and the plurality of its meanings, see
Meinecke 1957; Bew 2015; McQueen 2017. On &lsquo;realism&rsquo; in
recent political theory see Galston 2010, Sabl and Sagar 2017.</p>

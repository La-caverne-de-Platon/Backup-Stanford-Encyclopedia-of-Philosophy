<h1>SEP's Value for Research, Education, the Profession, and the Public</h1>

<h2><a id="value-research">The SEP's Value for Research</a></h2>

<p>
 Researchers benefit from the SEP's up-to-date content, in-depth
coverage, extensive bibliographies, and links to other current web
resources.  The value of being current and responsive to research
cannot be overstated --- consider, for example, that the entry on
voluntary euthanasia was updated within a few weeks after the
Netherlands changed its laws, enabling those researching the topic to
have current facts, references, and expert analysis.</p>

<p>
 At an average of 12,000 words, SEP entries are significantly longer
than those found in other encyclopedias of philosophy (which typically
range from 1,000-3,000 words).  Our model has encouraged authors to
produce entries of such substance and depth that they can be
considered research products in their own right.  Most SEP entries
develop a broad and insightful perspective on a topic and thereby help
to make the problems and concepts clearer to everyone.  Our authors
also frequently add items to their bibliography very shortly after
significant new publications appear in print, allowing other
researchers to easily identify the latest work.  Every SEP entry
contains an &lsquo;Other Internet Resources&rsquo; section where our
authors place links to the best web sites (in their judgement) on
their topic. Thus, we provide human assessment of online resources
that is not provided by ordinary search engines, and that is backed by
a level of expertise that is rare in other web portals.</p>

<p>
 The collaboration within the SEP's extensive network of respected
subject editors and authors promotes inclusiveness with respect to
philosophical subjects and schools of thought.  For example, the SEP
covers subjects from aesthetics to philosophy of physics, has
appointed subject editors for African and African-American Philosophy,
Feminist Philosophy, Judaic Philosophy, Chinese Philosophy, and Islamic
and Arabic Philosophy. (For a complete list of the subject areas and
subject editors, see </p>
 
<blockquote>
 <a href="../board.html">The SEP's Editorial Board</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The SEP helps to promote interdisciplinary research since it
contains articles that are relevant to many different disciplines in
the humanities and sciences: entries in aesthetics are relevant to art
history; entries on ancient philosophy are relevant to the classics;
entries on post-modern philosophy are relevant to literary criticism;
entries on ethics to the humanities in general; biographical entries
on prominent philosophers relate to the history of ideas and cultural
studies; entries in philosophy of language are relevant to
linguistics; etc. The SEP is not just for philosophers.</p>

<p>
 We have evidence that the SEP is being read by researchers in other
academic fields. In an April 2002 survey of our readership, 38% of
our readers said they specialized in mathematics, computer science, or
the natural sciences.  In a recent search on `quantum mechanics' in
Google, the SEP entry on the topic ranked 4th out of 1.5 million
matches, and was the highest ranked site not created by
scientists. This high ranking in the top 0.0003% of sites returned
cannot be accounted for solely by the links to the SEP that are
maintained by philosophers. This reveals the extent of academic and
public interest in the perspective of a central humanistic discipline
on the sciences.</p>

<p>
 Our archives also have value for future research.  They will allow
users to research the history of philosophical ideas by tracing
developments in key philosophical concepts and interpretations of key
philosophical figures through changes in the corresponding
entries. They will also become repositories of biographical
information about the work of our more prominent authors.</p>

<h2><a id="value-education">The SEP's Value for Education</a></h2>

<p>
  Evidence for the value of the SEP for education is based on several
sources.  First, using data derived from our April 2002 survey, we
discovered that 52% of over 1000 respondents were students (of all
levels) and another 14% identified themselves as instructors.</p>

<p>
 These numbers indicate that both sides of the learning relationship
between teachers and students are being served by the SEP.  We found
it interesting that 10% of the students who responded to our survey
indicated that they were high-school students.</p>

<blockquote>
 [Note: The survey was voluntary and reflects only a
small proportion of total readership during the survey period.
Respondents indicated their membership in the following groups:
instructor, professional researcher, student, and other.  Respondents
falling into more than one category were allowed to indicate this.
Because it may have been that response rates for students were higher
than for instructors and researchers, it is not possible to draw firm
conclusions about the composition of the SEP readership. However, we
have no specific reasons for believing that one category of users
responded at a different rate from the others, and the response rates
obtained are consistent with other sources of information we have
about the composition of our readership.]
 </blockquote>

<p>
 Further evidence of the impact of the SEP on education can be found
from the number of course syllabi that contain references to the SEP.
A recent search on Google for &ldquo;course syllabus &lsquo;Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy&rsquo;&rdquo; produced 840 matches ---
inspection of the first 20 reveals that 70% of these are indeed
course syllabi. Survey respondents frequently mentioned that they put
links to the encyclopedia on their syllabi and course lecture notes,
and that they recommend SEP articles to graduate and undergraduate
students, especially those in the initial stages of writing a
paper. The instructors' comments also indicate that the SEP
contributes to improving the quality of undergraduate
education. Several instructors reported using SEP articles to brush up
on topics they were teaching, and to help develop bibliographies for
their students. In some cases instructors reported that they had been
led to the SEP by their students.</p>

<h2><a id="value-profession">The SEP's Value to the Profession</a></h2>

The SEP also has considerable value for the profession of philosophy.
Not only does it bring the work of philosophers to the attention of
the public, it increases public understanding of the profession and
appreciation for the value of philosophy. It attracts high school and
college students to pursue degrees in philosophy and it helps students
in other disciplines to see the interdisciplinary relevance of
philosophy to their own studies.  The broad and voluntary
participation of the profession in the SEP shows the commitment of
academic philosophers to the public good, and therefore reflects well
on the profession as a whole.  

<p>
 A very important value that the SEP has for the profession is the way
it raises the profession's profile at prestigious funding
institutions.  If you would like evidence of this, you may contact
Michael Kelly, Executive Director of the APA, who will tell you about
conversations he had about the SEP's profile at the NEH with the
Director of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and others
at some recent meetings of the American Council of Learned Societies.
This profile has resulted from our excellent history of competing
successfully for grants:</p>

 <ol>
 <li>The National Endowment for the Humanities awarded $131,400 for
the years 1998-2000 (#PA-23167-98); </li>
 <li>The National Science Foundation awarded $528,900 for
the years 2000-2003 (#IIS-9981549); </li>
 <li>The National Endowment for the Humanitieis  awarded $300,828 for
the years 2003-2005 (#PA-50133-03); and</li>
 <li>The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation awarded the SEP a $43,000
Officers Grant from February 2002 -- August 2002.</li>
</ol>

<p>
 It is also important to mention that the SEP received seed money from the
American Philosophical Association (APA) and the Canadian
Philosophical Association (CPA), and they, along with the Australasian
Association of Philosophy and the European Society for Analytic
Philosophy, are strongly supportive of the SEP. </p>

<h2><a id="value-public">The SEP's Value to the Public</a></h2>

<p>
 The SEP brings philosophy to a wider audience than just those in
academia.  25% of readers in our survey identified themselves as
neither students, instructors, nor researchers. In the light of the
fact that many SEP entries are being downloaded tens of thousands of
times each year, our reference work is finding a significant public
readership.  (The entry on Nietzsche was downloaded 164,000 times in
the 2002-2003 academic year and the entry on voluntary euthanasia was
downloaded 61,500 times during that same period.)  To our knowledge,
no other refereed and scholarly resource in philosophy has this kind
of readership, and so the SEP may be philosophy's most visible public
face.</p>

<p>
  To illustrate with a concrete example, the author of the SEP entry
on holes, Professor Achille Varzi (Philosophy, Columbia University),
was interviewed on CNN because the definition of &lsquo;hole&rsquo;
played a crucial role in the vote count in Florida during the 2000
presidential election.  (Does a hole in a ballot have to be more like
a hole in a colander, which goes all the way through the surface, or
can it be more like a pothole or a hole in the ground, which only
deforms the surface?)  The CNN reporter sought an expert, and might
have identified Varzi as such by querying Google --- the SEP entry on
holes comes up as the first web page that isn't about black holes or
the movie <em>Holes</em>.  During the 2002-2003 academic year, 1.1
million accesses to the SEP were the result of a Google search.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, there were approximately 280,000 accesses from the .gov
domain during the previous academic year, and 54,000 from the .mil
domain.  The SEP's high visibility on the web ensures that
policy-makers seeking a systematic treatment of philosophical issues
of interest to the public, such as voluntary euthanasia or war, are
likely to encounter the SEP entry on the topic.

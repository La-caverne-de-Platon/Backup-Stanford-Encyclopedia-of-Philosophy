<h1>Quantum Computing</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Sun Dec 3, 2006; substantive revision Mon Sep 30, 2019</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Combining physics, mathematics and computer science, quantum computing
and its sister discipline of
 <a href="../qt-entangle/index.html">quantum information</a>
 have developed in the past few decades from visionary ideas to two of
the most fascinating areas of quantum theory. General interest and
excitement in quantum computing was initially triggered by Peter Shor
(1994) who showed how a quantum algorithm could exponentially
&#8220;speed-up&#8221; classical computation and factor large numbers
into primes far more efficiently than any (known) classical algorithm.
Shor&#8217;s algorithm was soon followed by several other algorithms
that aimed to solve combinatorial and algebraic problems, and in the
years since theoretical study of quantum systems serving as
computational devices has achieved tremendous progress. Common belief
has it that the implementation of Shor&#8217;s algorithm on a large
scale quantum computer would have devastating consequences for current
cryptography protocols which rely on the premise that all known
classical worst-case algorithms for <em>factoring</em> take time
exponential in the length of their input (see, e.g., Preskill 2005).
Consequently, experimentalists around the world are engaged in
attempts to tackle the technological difficulties that prevent the
realisation of a large scale quantum computer. But regardless whether
these technological problems can be overcome (Unruh 1995; Ekert and
Jozsa 1996; Haroche and Raimond 1996), it is noteworthy that no proof
exists yet for the <em>general</em> superiority of quantum computers
over their classical counterparts.</p>

<p>
The philosophical interest in quantum computing is manifold. From a
social-historical perspective, quantum computing is a domain where
experimentalists find themselves ahead of their fellow theorists.
Indeed, quantum mysteries such as
 <a href="../qt-entangle/index.html">entanglement</a>
 and
 <a href="../qt-epr/index.html">nonlocality</a>
 were historically considered a philosophical quibble, until
physicists discovered that these mysteries might be harnessed to
devise new efficient algorithms. But while the technology for
harnessing the power of 50&ndash;100 qubits (the basic unit of information
in the quantum computer) is now within reach (Preskill 2018), only a
handful of quantum algorithms exist, and the question of whether these
can truly outperform any conceivable classical alternative is still
open. From a more philosophical perspective, advances in quantum
computing may yield foundational benefits. For example, it may turn
out that the technological capabilities that allow us to isolate
quantum systems by shielding them from the effects of
 <a href="../qm-decoherence/index.html">decoherence</a>
 for a period of time long enough to manipulate them will also allow
us to make progress in some fundamental problems in the foundations of
quantum theory itself. Indeed, the development and the implementation
of efficient quantum algorithms may help us understand better the
border between classical and quantum physics (Cuffaro 2017, 2018a; cf.
Pitowsky 1994, 100), and perhaps even illuminate fundamental concepts
such as
 <a href="../qt-issues/index.html">measurement</a>
 and
 <a href="../causation-mani/index.html">causality</a>.
 Finally, the idea that abstract mathematical concepts such as
<em>computability</em> and <em>complexity</em> may not only be
translated into physics, but also <em>re-written</em> by physics bears
directly on the autonomous character of computer science and the
status of its theoretical entities&#8212;the so-called
&#8220;computational kinds&#8221;. As such it is also relevant to the
long-standing philosophical debate on the relationship between
mathematics and the physical world.</p>

<h3 id="PhysCompComp">1.1 Physical Computational Complexity</h3>

<p>
The mathematical model for a &#8220;universal&#8221; computer was
defined long before the invention of computers and is called the
 <a href="../turing-machine/index.html">Turing machine</a>
 (Turing 1936). A Turing machine consists of an unbounded tape, a head
capable of reading from and writing to it which can occupy one of a
potentially infinite number of possible states, and an instruction
table (i.e. a transition function). This table, given the head&#8217;s
initial state and the input it reads from the tape in that state,
determines (a) the symbol that the head will write on the tape, (b)
the internal state it will occupy, and (c) the displacement of the
head on the tape. In 1936 Turing showed that since one can encode the
instruction table of a Turing machine \(T\) and express it as a binary
number \(\#(T)\), there exists a universal Turing machine \(U\) that
can simulate the instruction table of any Turing machine on any given
input. That the Turing machine model captures the concept of
computability in its entirety is the essence of the
 <a href="../church-turing/index.html">Church-Turing thesis</a>,
 according to which any effectively calculable function can be
computed using a Turing machine. Admittedly, no counterexample to this
thesis (which is the result of convergent ideas of Turing, Post,
Kleene and Church) has yet been found. But since it identifies the
class of computable functions with the class of those functions which
are computable using a Turing machine, this thesis involves both a
precise mathematical notion and an informal and intuitive notion,
hence cannot be proved or disproved. Simple cardinality considerations
show, however, that not all functions are Turing-computable (the set
of all Turing machines is countable, while the set of all functions
from the natural numbers to the natural numbers is not), and the
discovery of this fact came as a complete surprise in the 1930s (Davis
1958).</p>

<p>
Computability, or the question whether a function can be computed, is
not the only question that interests computer scientists. Beginning
especially in the 1960s (Cobham 1965; Edmonds 1965; Hartmanis and
Stearns 1965), the question of the <em>cost</em> of computing a
function (which was to some extent already anticipated in 1956 by
G&#246;del) also came to be of great importance. This cost, also known
as
 <a href="../computational-complexity/index.html">computational complexity</a>,
 is measured naturally in the physical resources (e.g., time, space,
energy) invested in order to solve the computational problem at hand.
Computer scientists classify computational problems according to the
way their cost function behaves as a function of their input size,
\(n\) (the number of bits required to store the input) and in
particular, whether it increases exponentially or polynomially with
\(n\). <em>Tractable</em> problems are those which can be solved in
polynomial cost, while <em>intractable</em> problems are those which
can only be solved with exponential cost (the former solutions are
commonly regarded as <em>efficient</em> although an exponential-time
algorithm could turn out to be more efficient than a polynomial-time
algorithm for some range of input sizes).</p>

<p>
So far, the Turing machines we have been discussing have been
deterministic; for such machines, their behaviour at any given time is
wholly determined by their state plus whatever their input happens to
be. In other words such machines have a unique &#8220;instruction
table&#8221; (i.e. transition function). We can generalise the Turing
model, however, by allowing a machine to instantiate more than one
transition function simultaneously. A <em>nondeterministic Turing
machine</em> (NTM), upon being presented with a given input in a given
state, is allowed to &#8216;choose&#8217; which of its transition
functions to follow, and we say that it solves a given problem
whenever, given some input, there exists at least one path through its
state space leading to a solution. Exactly how an NTM
&#8220;chooses&#8221; whether to follow one transition function rather
than another is left undefined (in his 1936 paper, Turing originally
conceived these choices as those of an external operator). In
particular, we do not assume that any probabilities are attached to
these choices. In a <em>probabilistic Turing machine</em> (PTM), on
the other hand, we characterise the computer&#8217;s choices by
associating a particular probability with each of its possible
transitions.</p>

<p>
Probabilistic and deterministic Turing machines (DTMs) have different
success criteria. A successful deterministic algorithm for a given
problem is guaranteed to yield the correct answer given its input. Of
a successful probabilistic algorithm, on the other hand, we only
demand that it yield a correct answer with &#8220;high&#8221;
probability (minimally, we demand that it be strictly greater than
1/2). It was believed, until relatively recently, that for some
problems (see, e.g. Rabin 1976) probabilistic algorithms are
dramatically more efficient than any deterministic alternatives; in
other words that the set or &#8220;class&#8221; of problems
efficiently solvable by PTM is larger than the class of problems
efficiently solvable by DTM. Fascinatingly, evidence has been mounting
in recent years (e.g. Agrawal, Kayal, and Saxena 2004) that this is
not the case, and it is now believed that the PTM model in fact does
not offer a computational advantage in this sense over the DTM model
(Arora and Barak 2009 Ch. 20). Probabilistic (Turing) computation is
nevertheless interesting to consider, because abstractly a
<em>quantum</em> computer is just a variation on the PTM which
<em>does</em> appear to offer computational advantages over
deterministic computation, although as already mentioned this
conjecture still awaits a proof. See Hagar (2007) and Cuffaro (2018b)
for divergent opinions over what this purported quantum computational
advantage tells us about the theory of computational complexity as a
whole.</p>

<p>
The class \(\mathbf{P}\) (for Polynomial) is the class containing all
the computational decision problems that can be solved by a DTM in
polynomial time. The class <strong>NP</strong> (for Non-deterministic
Polynomial) is the class containing all the computational decision
problems that can be solved by an NTM in polynomial
 time.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 The most famous problems in <strong>NP</strong> are called
&#8220;<strong>NP</strong>-complete&#8221;, where
&#8220;complete&#8221; designates the fact that these problems stand
or fall together: Either they are all tractable, or none of them is!
If we knew how to solve an <strong>NP</strong>-complete problem
efficiently (i.e., with polynomial cost) we could use it to
efficiently solve any other problem in <strong>NP</strong> (Cook
1971). Today we know of hundreds of examples of
<strong>NP</strong>-complete problems (Garey and Johnson 1979), all of
which are reducible one to another with polynomial slowdown, and since
the best known algorithm for any of these problems is exponential, the
widely believed conjecture is that there is no polynomial algorithm
that can solve them. Clearly \(\mathbf{P} \subseteq \mathbf{NP}\).
Proving or disproving the conjecture that \(\mathbf{P} \ne
\mathbf{NP}\), however, remains perhaps one of the most important open
questions in computer science and complexity theory.</p>

<p>
Although the original Church-Turing thesis involves the
<em>abstract</em> mathematical notion of computability, physicists as
well as computer scientists often interpret it as saying something
about the scope and limitations of <em>physical</em> computing
machines. Wolfram (1985) claims that any physical system can be
simulated (to any degree of approximation) by a universal Turing
machine, and that complexity bounds on Turing machine simulations have
physical significance. For example, if the computation of the minimum
energy of some system of \(n\) particles requires at least an
exponentially increasing number of steps in \(n\), then the actual
relaxation of this system to its minimum energy state will also take
exponential time. Aharonov (1999) strengthens this thesis (in the
context of showing its putative incompatibility with quantum
mechanics) when she says that a PTM can simulate any reasonable
physical device at polynomial cost. In order for the physical
Church-Turing thesis to make sense we have to relate physical space
and time parameters to their computational counterparts: memory
capacity and number of computation steps, respectively. There are
various ways to do that, leading to different formulations of the
thesis (Pitowsky 1990). For example, one can encode the set of
instructions of a universal Turing machine and the state of its
infinite tape in the binary development of the position coordinates of
a single particle. Consequently, one can physically
&#8216;realise&#8217; a universal Turing machine as a billiard ball
with hyperbolic mirrors (Moore 1990; Pitowsky 1996). For the most
intuitive connection between abstract Turing machines and physical
devices see the pioneering work of Gandy (1980), simplified later by
Sieg and Byrnes (1999), and discussed, for example, in Copeland
(2018). It should be stressed that there is no relation between the
original Church-Turing thesis and its physical version (Pitowsky and
Shagrir 2003), and while the former concerns the concept of
computation that is relevant to logic (since it is strongly tied to
the notion of <em>proof</em> which requires <em>validation</em>), it
does not analytically entail that <em>all</em> computations should be
subject to validation. Indeed, there is a long historical tradition of
analog computations which use continuous physical processes (Dewdney
1984), and the output of these computations is validated either by
repetitive &#8220;runs&#8221; or by validating the physical theory
that presumably governs the behaviour of the analog computer.</p>

<h3 id="PhysShorCutsComp">1.2 Physical &ldquo;Short-cuts&rdquo; of Computation</h3>

<p>
Do physical processes exist which contradict the physical
Church-Turing thesis? Apart from analog computation, there exist at
least two main kinds of example purporting to show that the notion of
recursion, or Turing-computability, is not a natural <em>physical</em>
property (Pour-el and Richards 1981; Pitowsky 1990; Hogarth 1994).
Although the physical systems involved (a specific initial condition
for the wave equation in three dimensions and an exotic solution to
Einstein&#8217;s field equations, respectively) are somewhat
contrived, a thriving school of &#8220;hypercomputation&#8221; that
aspires to extend the limited examples of physical
&#8220;hypercomputers&#8221; and in so doing to physically
&#8220;compute&#8221; the non-Turing-computable has nevertheless
emerged (for a review see Copeland (2002); for a criticism: Davis
(2003); for a recent proposal and response to criticisms see
Andr&#233;ka et al. (2018)). <em>Quantum</em> hypercomputation is
rarely discussed in the literature (see, e.g., Adamyan, Calude, and
Pavlov 2004), but the most concrete attempt to harness quantum theory
to compute the non-computable is the suggestion to use the quantum
adiabatic algorithm (see below) to solve Hilbert&#8217;s Tenth Problem
(Kieu 2002, 2004)&#8212;a Turing-undecidable problem equivalent to the
halting problem. Criticism, however, has exposed the unphysical
character of the alleged quantum adiabatic hypercomputer (see Hodges
2005; Hagar and Korolev 2007).</p>

<p>
Setting aside &#8220;hypercomputers&#8221;, even if we restrict
ourselves only to Turing-computable functions, one can still find many
proposals in the literature that purport to display
&#8220;short-cuts&#8221; in computational resources. Consider, e.g.,
the DNA model of computation that was claimed (Adleman 1994; Lipton
1995) to solve <strong>NP</strong>-complete problems in polynomial
time. A closer inspection shows that the cost of the computation in
this model is still exponential since the number of molecules in the
physical system grows exponentially with the size of the problem. Or
take an allegedly instantaneous solution to another
<strong>NP</strong>-complete problem using a construction of rods and
balls (Vergis, Steiglitz, and Dickinson 1986) that unfortunately
ignores the accumulating time-delays in the rigid rods that result in
an exponential overall slowdown. It appears that these and other
similar models cannot serve as counter-examples to the physical
Church-Turing thesis (as far as complexity is concerned) since they
all require some exponential physical resource. Note, however, that
all these models are based on classical physics, hence the unavoidable
question: Can the shift to quantum physics allow us to find
&#8220;short-cuts&#8221; in computational resources? The quest for the
quantum computer began with the possibility of giving a positive
answer to this question.</p>

<h3 id="Mile">1.3 Milestones</h3>

<p>
The idea of a computational device based on quantum mechanics was
explored already in the 1970s by physicists and computer scientists.
As early as 1969 Steven Wiesner suggested quantum information
processing as a possible way to better accomplish cryptologic tasks.
But the first four published papers on quantum information (Wiesner
published his only in 1983), belong to Alexander Holevo (1973), R. P.
Poplavskii (1975), Roman Ingarden (1976), and Yuri Manin (1980).
Better known are contributions made in the early 1980s by Charles H.
Bennett of the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Paul A. Benioff
of Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, David Deutsch of the
University of Oxford, and Richard P. Feynman of the California
Institute of Technology. The idea emerged when scientists were
investigating the fundamental physical limits of computation. If
technology continued to abide by &#8220;Moore&#8217;s Law&#8221; (the
observation made in 1965 by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, that
the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had
doubled every 18 months since the integrated circuit was invented),
then the continually shrinking size of circuitry packed onto silicon
chips would eventually reach a point where individual elements would
be no larger than a few atoms. But since the physical laws that govern
the behaviour and properties of the putative circuit at the atomic
scale are inherently quantum mechanical in nature, not classical, the
natural question arose whether a new kind of computer could be devised
based on the principles of quantum physics.</p>

<p>
Inspired by Ed Fredkin&#8217;s ideas on reversible computation (see
Hagar 2016), Feynman was among the first to attempt to provide an
answer to this question by producing an abstract model in 1982 that
showed how a quantum system could be used to do computations. He also
explained how such a machine would be able to act as a simulator for
quantum physics, conjecturing that any classical computer could do the
same task only inefficiently. In 1985 David Deutsch proposed the first
universal quantum Turing machine and paved the way to the quantum
circuit model (Deutsch 1989). The young and thriving domain also
attracted philosophers&#8217; attention. In 1983 David Albert showed
how a quantum mechanical automaton behaves remarkably differently from
a classical automaton, and in 1990 Itamar Pitowsky raised the question
of whether the superposition principle may allow quantum computers to
efficiently solve <strong>NP</strong>-complete problems. He also
stressed that although one could in principle &#8216;squeeze&#8217;
information of exponential complexity into polynomially many quantum
states, the real problem lay in the efficient retrieval of this
information.</p>

<p>
Progress in quantum algorithms began in the 1990s, with the discovery
of the Deutsch-Josza algorithm (1992) and of Simon&#8217;s algorithm
(1994). The latter supplied the basis for Shor&#8217;s algorithm for
<em>factoring</em>. Published in 1994, this algorithm marked a
&#8216;phase transition&#8217; in the development of quantum computing
and sparked a tremendous interest even outside the physics community.
In that year the first experimental realisation of the quantum
<em>CNOT</em> gate with trapped ions was proposed by Cirac and Zoller
(1995). In 1995, Peter Shor and Andrew Steane proposed (independently)
the first scheme for quantum error-correction. In that same year the
first realisation of a quantum logic gate was done in Boulder,
Colorado, following Cirac and Zoller&#8217;s proposal. In 1996, Lov
Grover from Bell Labs invented a quantum search algorithm which yields
a provable (though only quadratic) &#8220;speed-up&#8221; compared to
its classical counterparts. A year later the first model for quantum
computation based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques was
proposed. This technique was realised in 1998 with a 2-qubit register,
and was scaled up to 7 qubits in the Los Alamos National Lab in
2000.</p>

<p>
Since 2000 the field has seen tremendous growth. New paradigms of
quantum algorithms have appeared, such as adiabatic algorithms,
measurement-based algorithms, and
topological-quantum-field-theory-based algorithms, as well as new
physical models for realising a large scale quantum computer with cold
ion traps, quantum optics (using photons and optical cavity),
condensed matter systems and solid state physics (meanwhile, the first
NMR model had turned out to be a dead-end with respect to scaling; see
DiVincenzo (2000)). The basic questions, however, remain open even
today: (1) theoretically, can quantum algorithms efficiently solve
classically intractable problems? (2) operationally, can we actually
realise a large scale quantum computer to run these algorithms?</p>

<h2 id="Basi">2. Basics</h2>

<p>
In this section we review the basic paradigm for quantum algorithms,
namely the quantum circuit model, which is composed of the basic
quantum units of information (qubits) and the basic logical
manipulations thereof (quantum gates). For more detailed introductions
see Nielsen and Chuang (2000) and Mermin (2007).</p>

<h3 id="Qubi">2.1 The Qubit</h3>

<p>
The qubit is the quantum analogue of the bit, the classical
fundamental unit of information. It is a mathematical object with
specific properties that can be realised in an actual physical system
in many different ways. Just as the classical bit has a <em>state</em>
(either 0 or 1), a qubit also has a state. Yet contrary to the
classical bit, \(\lvert 0\rangle\) and \(\lvert 1\rangle\) are but two
possible states of the qubit, and any linear combination
(superposition) thereof is also physically possible. <em>In
general</em>, thus, the physical state of a qubit is the superposition
\(\lvert\psi \rangle = \alpha \lvert 0\rangle + \beta \lvert
1\rangle\) (where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are complex numbers). The
state of a qubit can be described as a vector in a two-dimensional
Hilbert space, a complex vector space (see the entry on
 <a href="../qm/index.html">quantum mechanics</a>).
 The special states \(\lvert 0\rangle\) and \(\lvert 1\rangle\) are
known as the <em>computational basis states</em>, and form an
orthonormal basis for this vector space. According to quantum theory,
when we try to measure the qubit in this basis in order to determine
its state, we get either \(\lvert 0\rangle\) with probability \(\lvert
\alpha\rvert^2\) or \(\lvert 1\rangle\) with probability \(\lvert
\beta\rvert^2\). Since \(\lvert \alpha\rvert^2 + \lvert\beta\rvert^2 =
1\) (i.e., the qubit is a <em>unit</em> vector in the aforementioned
two-dimensional Hilbert space), we may (ignoring the overall phase
factor) effectively write its state as \(\lvert \psi \rangle =\)
cos\((\theta)\lvert 0\rangle + e^{i\phi}\)sin\((\theta)\lvert
1\rangle\), where the numbers \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) define a point
on the unit three-dimensional sphere, as shown here. This sphere is
often called <em>the Bloch sphere</em>, and it provides a useful means
to visualise the state of a single qubit.</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">The Bloch Sphere</span></p>
</div>

<p>
Since \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are complex and therefore continuous
variables one might think that a single qubit is capable of storing an
infinite amount of information. When measured, however, it yields only
the classical result (0 or 1) with certain probabilities specified by
the quantum state. In other words, the measurement <em>changes</em>
the state of the qubit, &#8220;collapsing&#8221; it from a
superposition to one of its terms. In fact one can prove (Holevo 1973)
that the amount of information actually retrievable from a single
qubit (what Timpson (2013, 47ff.) calls its &#8220;accessible
information&#8221;) is no more than one bit. If the qubit is
<em>not</em> measured, however, the amount of &#8220;hidden&#8221;
information it &#8220;stores&#8221; (what Timpson calls its
&#8220;specification information&#8221;) is conserved under its
(unitary) dynamical evolution. This feature of quantum mechanics
allows one to manipulate the information stored in unmeasured qubits
with quantum gates (i.e. unitary transformations), and is one of the
sources for the putative power of quantum computers.</p> 

<p>
To see why, let us suppose we have two qubits at our disposal. If
these were classical bits, then they could be in four possible states
(00, 01, 10, 11). Correspondingly, a pair of qubits has
four <em>computational basis states</em> (\(\lvert 00\rangle\),
\(\lvert 01\rangle\), \(\lvert 10\rangle\), \(\lvert 11\rangle)\). But
while a single classical two-bit register can store these numbers
only <em>one at a time</em>, a pair of qubits can also exist in a
superposition of these four basis states, each with its own complex
coefficient (whose mod square, being interpreted as a probability, is
normalised). For example, using a &#8220;Hadamard
gate&#8221;&#8212;which unitarily transforms a single qubit to the
state \(\frac{\lvert 0\rangle + \lvert 1\rangle}{\sqrt 2}\) whenever
it is in the state \(\lvert 0\rangle\), and to the state
\(\frac{\lvert 0\rangle - \lvert 1\rangle}{\sqrt 2}\) whenever it is
in the state \(\lvert 1\rangle\)&#8212;we can transform the
\(n\)-qubit state \(\lvert 0...01 \rangle\) as
follows:</p>

<span class="math display">\[\tag{1} | 0^n \rangle| 1 \rangle
\xrightarrow{H} \sum_{x \in \{0,1\}^n}\frac{1}{2^{n/2}}~\lvert x
\rangle~\lvert - \rangle,\]</span> 

<p>
where \(\lvert - \rangle =_{df} \frac{| 0 \rangle - | 1 \rangle}{\sqrt
2}\). The resulting state is a superposition of \(2^n\) terms and can
be imagined to &#8220;store&#8221; that many bits of (specification)
information. The difficult task, however, is to use this information
efficiently in light of the bound on the state&#8217;s accessible
information.</p>

<h3 id="QuanGate">2.2 Quantum Gates</h3>

<p>
Classical computational gates are Boolean logic gates that manipulate
information stored in bits. In quantum computing such gates are
represented by matrices, and can be visualised as rotations over the
Bloch sphere. This visualisation represents the fact that quantum
gates are unitary operators, i.e., they preserve the norm of the
quantum state (if \(U\) is a matrix describing a single qubit gate,
then \(U^{\dagger}U=I\), where \(U^{\dagger}\) is the <em>adjoint</em>
of \(U\), obtained by transposing and then complex-conjugating \(U)\).
In classical computing some gates are &#8220;universal&#8221;. For
example the <em>NAND</em> gate is a gate that evaluates the function
&#8220;not both A and B&#8221; over its two inputs. By stringing
together a number of <em>NAND</em> gates it is possible to compute any
computable function. Another universal gate is the <em>NOR</em> gate,
which evaluates the function &#8220;not (A or B)&#8221;. In the
context of quantum computing it was shown (DiVincenzo 1995) that
two-qubit gates (i.e. which transform two qubits) are sufficient to
realise a general quantum circuit, in the sense that a circuit
composed exclusively from a small set of one- and two-qubit gates can
approximate to arbitrary accuracy any unitary transformation of \(n\)
qubits. Barenco <em>et. al.</em> (1995) showed in particular that any
multiple qubit logic gate may be composed in this sense from a
combination of single-qubit gates and the two-qubit controlled-not
(<em>CNOT</em>) gate, which either flips or preserves its
&#8220;target&#8221; input bit depending on the state of its
&#8220;control&#8221; input bit (specifically: in a <em>CNOT</em> gate
the output state of the target qubit is the result of an operation
analogous to the classical exclusive-OR (<em>XOR</em>) gate on the
inputs). One general feature of quantum gates that distinguishes them
from classical gates is that they are always reversible: the inverse
of a unitary matrix is also a unitary matrix, and thus a quantum gate
can always be inverted by another quantum gate.</p>

<span class="figlabel">The CNOT Gate</span></p>
</div>

<p>
Unitary gates manipulate information stored in the &#8220;quantum
register&#8221;&#8212;a quantum system&#8212;and in this sense
ordinary (unitary) quantum evolution can be regarded as a computation.
In order to read the result of this computation, however, the quantum
register must be measured. The measurement gate is a non-unitary gate
that &#8220;collapses&#8221; the quantum superposition in the register
onto one of its terms with a probability corresponding to its complex
coefficient. Usually this measurement is done in the computational
basis (see the previous section), but since quantum mechanics allows
one to express an arbitrary state as a linear combination of basis
states, provided that the states are orthonormal (a condition that
ensures normalisation) one can <em>in principle</em> measure the
register in any arbitrary orthonormal basis. This, however,
doesn&#8217;t mean that measurements in different bases are equivalent
complexity-wise. Indeed, one of the difficulties in constructing
efficient quantum algorithms stems exactly from the fact that
measurement collapses the state, and some measurements are much more
complicated than others.</p>

<h3 id="QuanCirc">2.3 Quantum Circuits</h3>

<p>
Quantum circuits are similar to classical computer circuits in that
they consist of <em>wires</em> and <em>logical gates</em>. The wires
are used to carry the information, while the gates manipulate it (note
that the wires are abstract and do not necessarily correspond to
physical wires; they may correspond to a physical particle, e.g. a
photon, moving from one location to another in space, or even to
time-evolution). Conventionally, the input of the quantum circuit is
assumed to be a number of qubits each initialised to a computational
basis state (typically \(\lvert 0\rangle\)). The output state of the
circuit is then measured in the computational basis, or in any other
arbitrary orthonormal basis. The first quantum algorithms (i.e.
Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Shor and Grover) were constructed in this
paradigm. Additional paradigms for quantum computing exist today that
differ from the quantum circuit model in many interesting ways. So
far, however, they all have been demonstrated to be computationally
equivalent to the circuit model (see below), in the sense that any
computational problem that can be solved by the circuit model can be
solved by these new models with only a polynomial overhead in
computational resources. This is analogous to the fact that in
classical computation every &#8220;reasonable&#8221; model can be
efficiently simulated by any other. For discussion see Cuffaro (2018b,
274).</p>

<h2 id="QuanAlgo">3 Quantum Algorithms</h2>

<p>
Algorithm design is a highly complicated task, and in quantum
computing, delicately leveraging the features of quantum mechanics in
order to make our algorithms more efficient makes the task even more
complicated. But before discussing this aspect of quantum algorithm
design, let us first convince ourselves that quantum computers can be
harnessed to perform standard, classical, computation without any
computational speed-up. In some sense this is obvious, given the
belief in the universal character of quantum mechanics, and the
observation that any quantum computation that is diagonal in the
computational basis, i.e., that involves no interference between the
qubits, is effectively classical. Yet the demonstration that quantum
circuits can be used to simulate classical circuits is not
straightforward (recall that the former are always reversible while
the latter use gates which are in general irreversible). Indeed,
quantum circuits cannot be used <em>directly</em> to simulate
classical computation, but the latter can still be simulated on a
quantum computer using an intermediate gate, namely the
<em>Toffoli</em> gate. This universal classical gate has three input
bits and three output bits. Two of the input bits are control bits,
unaffected by the action of the gate. The third input bit is a target
bit that is flipped if both control bits are set to 1, and otherwise
is left alone. This gate is reversible (its inverse is itself), and by
stringing a number of such gates together one can simulate any
classical irreversible circuit.</p>

<p>
Consequently, using the quantum version of the <em>Toffoli</em> gate
(which by definition permutes the computational basis states similarly
to the classical <em>Toffoli</em> gate) one can simulate, although
rather tediously, irreversible classical logic gates with quantum
reversible ones. Quantum computers are thus capable of performing any
computation which a classical deterministic computer can do.</p>

<p>
What about probabilistic computation? Not surprisingly, a quantum
computer can also simulate this type of computation by using another
famous quantum gate, namely the Hadamard gate, a single-qubit gate
which receives as input the state \(\lvert 0\rangle\) and produces the
state \(\frac{\lvert 0\rangle + \lvert 1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}\).
Measuring this output state yields \(\lvert 0\rangle\) or \(\lvert
1\rangle\) with 50/50 probability, which can be used to simulate a
fair coin toss.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break">

      \[
      H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left[

      \]

<img src="Had1.png" alt="" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">The Hadamard Gate</span></p>
</div>

<p>
Obviously, if quantum algorithms could be used only to simulate
classical algorithms, then the technological advancement in
information storage and manipulation, encapsulated in
&#8220;Moore&#8217;s law&#8221;, would have only trivial consequences
on computational complexity theory, leaving the latter unaffected by
the physical world. But while some computational problems will always
resist quantum &#8220;speed-up&#8221; (in these problems the
computation time depends on the input, and this feature will lead to a
violation of unitarity hence to an effectively classical computation
even on a quantum computer&#8212;see Myers (1997) and Linden and
Popescu (1998)), the hope is, nonetheless, that quantum algorithms may
not only simulate classical ones, but that they will actually
<em>outperform</em> the latter in some cases, and in so doing help to
re-define the abstract notions of tractability and intractability and
violate the physical Church-Turing thesis, at least as far as
computational complexity is concerned.</p>

<h3 id="QuanCircBaseAlgo">3.1 Quantum-Circuit-Based Algorithms</h3>

<h4>3.1.1 Oracles</h4>

<p>
The first quantum algorithms were designed to solve problems which
essentially involve the use of an &#8220;oracle&#8221;, so let us
begin by explaining this term. Oracles are used by computer scientists
as conceptual aids in the complexity-theoretic analysis of algorithms.
We can think of an oracle as a kind of imaginary magic black box
(Arora and Barak (2009, 72&#8211;73); Aaronson (2013a, 29ff.)) to
which, like the famous oracle at Delphi, one poses (yes or no)
questions. Unlike that ancient oracle, the oracles considered in
computer science always return an answer in a <em>single</em> time
step. For example, we can imagine an oracle to determine whether a
given Boolean formula is satisfiable or not: Given as input the
description of a particular propositional formula, the oracle
outputs&#8212;in a single time step&#8212;a single bit indicating
whether or not there is a truth-value assignment satisfying that
formula. Obviously such a machine does not really
exist&#8212;<strong>SAT</strong> is an NP-complete problem&#8212;but
that is not the point. The point of using such imaginary devices is to
abstract away from certain &#8220;implementational details&#8221;
which are for whatever reason deemed unimportant for the
complexity-theoretic analysis of a given problem. For example,
Simon&#8217;s problem (Simon 1994, see below) is that of determining
the period of a given function \(f\) that is periodic under bit-wise
modulo-2 addition. Relative to Simon&#8217;s problem, we judge the
internal complexity of \(f\) to be unimportant, and so abstract away
from it by imagining that we have an oracle to evaluate it in a single
step. As useful as these conceptual devices are, however, their
usefulness has limitations. To take one example, there are oracles
relative to which <strong>P</strong> = <strong>NP</strong>, as well as
oracles relative to which <strong>P</strong> \(\not =\)
<strong>NP</strong>. This (and many other) questions are not clarified
by oracles (see Fortnow 1994).</p>

<h4>3.1.2 Deutsch&#8217;s Algorithm</h4>

<p>
Deutsch (1989) asks the following question: Suppose we have a function
\(f\) which can be either constant&#8212;i.e. such that it produces
the same output value for each of its possible inputs, or
balanced&#8212;i.e. such that the output of one half of its possible
inputs is the opposite of the output of the other half. The particular
example considered is the function \(f : \{0,1\} \rightarrow
\{0,1\}\), which is constant if \(f\)(0) \(= f\)(1) and balanced if
\(f\)(0) \(\ne f\)(1). Classically it would take <em>two</em>
evaluations of the function to tell whether it is one or the other.
Quantumly, we can answer this question in <em>one</em> evaluation. For
Deutsch, the explanation for this complexity reduction involves an
appeal to &#8220;many computational worlds&#8221; (see section 5.1.1).
 Arguably, however, a fully satisfactory answer appeals only to the
superposition principle and entanglement (Bub 2010).</p> 

<p>
After initially preparing the first and second qubits of the computer
in the state \(\lvert 0\rangle\lvert 0\rangle\), one then
&#8220;flips&#8221; the second qubit using a &#8220;NOT&#8221; gate
(i.e. a Pauli <strong>X</strong> operation) to \(\lvert 1 \rangle\),
and then subjects each qubit to a Hadamard gate. We now send the two
qubits through an oracle or &#8216;black box&#8217; which we imagine
as a unitary gate, \(\mathbf{U}_f\), representative of the function
whose character (of being either constant or balanced) we wish to
determine. We define \(\mathbf{U}_f\) so that it takes inputs like
\(\lvert x,y\rangle\) to \(\lvert x, y\oplus f (x)\rangle\), where
\(\oplus\) is addition modulo two (i.e. exclusive-or). The first qubit
is then fed into a further Hadamard gate, and the final output of the
algorithm (prior to measurement) is the state: \[\pm\lvert f(0)\oplus
f(1)\rangle~\lvert - \rangle,\] where \(\lvert - \rangle =_{df}
\frac{| 0 \rangle - | 1 \rangle}{\sqrt 2}\). Since \(f\)(0)\(\oplus
f\)(1) is 0 if the function is constant and 1 if the function is
balanced, a single measurement of the first qubit suffices to retrieve
the answer to our original question regarding the function&#8217;s
nature. And since there are two possible constant functions and two
possible balanced functions from \(f : \{0,1\} \rightarrow \{0,1\}\),
we can characterise the algorithm as distinguishing, using only one
oracle call, between two quantum disjunctions without finding out the
truth values of the disjuncts themselves, i.e. without
determining <em>which</em> balanced or <em>which</em> constant
function \(f\) is (Bub 2010).</p>

<p>
A generalisation of Deutsch&#8217;s problem, called the Deutsch-Jozsa
problem (Deutsch and Jozsa 1992), enlarges the class of functions
under consideration so as to include all of the functions
\(f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}\), i.e. rather than only considering \(n =
1\). The best deterministic classical algorithm for determining
whether a given such function is constant or balanced requires
\(\frac{2^{n}}{2}+1\) queries to an oracle in order to solve this
problem. In a quantum computer, however, we can answer the question
using <em>one</em> oracle call. Generalising our conclusion regarding
the Deutsch algorithm, we may say that the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm
allows one to evaluate a global property of the function in one
measurement because the output state is a superposition of balanced
and constant states such that the balanced states all lie in a
subspace orthogonal to the constant states and can therefore be
distinguished from the latter in a single measurement (Bub 2006a)</p>

<h4>3.1.3 Simon&#8217;s Algorithm</h4>

<p>
Suppose we have a Boolean function \(f\) on \(n\) bits that is 2-to-1,
i.e. that takes \(n\) bits to \(n-1\) bits in such a way that for
every \(n\)-bit integer \(x_1\) there is an \(n\)-bit integer \(x_2\)
for which \(f (x_{1}) = f (x_{2})\). The function is moreover periodic
in the sense that \(f(x_1)\) = \(f(x_2)\) if and only if \(x_1 = x_2
\oplus a\), where \(\oplus\) designates bit-wise modulo 2 addition and
\(a\) is an \(n\)-bit nonzero number called the <em>period</em> of
\(f\). Simon&#8217;s problem is the problem to find \(a\) given \(f\).
Relative to an oracle \(U_f\) which evaluates \(f\) in a single step,
Simon&#8217;s quantum algorithm (Simon 1994) finds the period of \(f\)
in a number of oracle calls that grows only linearly with the length
of \(n\), while the best known classical algorithm requires an
exponentially greater number of oracle calls. Simon&#8217;s algorithm
reduces to Deutsch&#8217;s algorithm when \(n=2\), and can be regarded
as an extension of the latter, in the sense that in both cases a
global property of a function is evaluated in no more than a
(sub-)polynomial number of oracle invocations, owing to the fact that
the output state of the computer just before the final measurement is
decomposed into orthogonal subspaces, only one of which contains the
problem&#8217;s solution. Note that one important difference between
Deutsch&#8217;s and Simon&#8217;s algorithms is that the former yields
a solution with certainty, whereas the latter only yields a solution
with probability very close to 1. For more on the logical analysis of
these first quantum-circuit-based algorithms see Bub (2006a) and Bub
(2010).</p>

<h4>3.1.4 Shor&#8217;s Algorithm</h4>

<p>
The algorithms just described, although demonstrating the potential
superiority of quantum computers over their classical counterparts,
nevertheless deal with apparently unimportant computational problems.
Moreover the speed-ups in each of them are only relative to their
respective oracles. It is doubtful whether research into quantum
computing would have attracted so much attention and evolved to its
current status if its merit could be demonstrated only with these
problems. But in 1994, Peter Shor realised that Simon&#8217;s
algorithm could be harnessed to solve a much more interesting and
crucial problem, namely <em>factoring</em>, which lies at the heart of
current cryptographic protocols such as RSA (Rivest, Shamir, and
Adleman 1978). Shor&#8217;s algorithm has turned quantum computing
into one of the most exciting research domains in quantum
mechanics.</p>

<p>
Shor&#8217;s algorithm exploits the ingenious number theoretic
argument that two prime factors \(p,q\) of a positive integer \(N=pq\)
can be found by determining the period of a function \(f(x) = y^x
\textrm{mod} N,\) for any \(y &lt; N\) which has no common factors
with \(N\) other than 1 (Nielsen and Chuang 2000 App. 4). The period
\(r\) of \(f(x)\) depends on \(y\) and \(N\). Once one knows it, one
can factor \(N\) if \(r\) is even and \(y^{\,\frac{r}{2}} \neq -1\)
mod \(N\), which will be jointly the case with probability greater
than \(\frac{1}{2}\) for any \(y\) chosen randomly (if not, one
chooses another value of \(y\) and tries again). The factors of \(N\)
are the greatest common divisors of \(y^{\,\frac{r}{2}} \pm 1\) and
\(N\), which can be found in polynomial time using the well known
Euclidean algorithm. In other words, Shor&#8217;s remarkable result
rests on the discovery that the problem of <em>factoring</em> reduces
to the problem of finding the period of a certain periodic function
\(f: Z_{n} \rightarrow Z_{N}\), where \(Z_{n}\) is the additive group
of integers mod \(n\) (Note that \(f(x) = y^{x}\ \textrm{mod}\ N\) so
that \(f(x+r) = f(x)\) if \(x+r \le n\). The function is periodic if
\(r\) divides \(n\) exactly, otherwise it is almost periodic). That
this problem can be solved efficiently by a quantum computer is hinted
at by Simon&#8217;s algorithm, which considers the more restricted
case of functions periodic under bit-wise modulo-2 addition as opposed
to the periodic functions under ordinary addition considered here.</p>

<p>
Shor&#8217;s result is the most dramatic example so far of quantum
&#8220;speed-up&#8221; of computation, notwithstanding the fact that
<em>factoring</em> is believed to be only in <strong>NP</strong> and
not in <strong>NP</strong>-complete (see Aaronson 2013a, 64&#8211;66).
To verify whether \(n\) is prime takes a number of steps which is a
polynomial in \(\log_{2}n\) (the binary encoding of a natural number
\(n\) requires \(\log_{2}n\) resources). But nobody knows how to
factor numbers into primes in polynomial time, and the best classical
algorithms we have for this problem are sub-exponential. This is yet
another open problem in the theory of computational complexity. Modern
cryptography and Internet security protocols are based on these facts
(Giblin 1993): It is easy to find large prime numbers fast, and it is
hard to factor large composite numbers in any reasonable amount of
time. The discovery that quantum computers can solve
<em>factoring</em> in polynomial time has had, therefore, a dramatic
effect. The implementation of the algorithm on a physical machine
would have economic, as well as scientific consequences (All&#233;aume
et al. 2014).</p>

<h4>3.1.5 Grover&#8217;s Algorithm</h4>

<p>
In a brilliant undercover operation, Agent 13 has managed to secure
two crucial bits of information concerning the whereabouts of the
arch-villain Siegfried: the phone number of the secret hideout from
which he intends to begin carrying out KAOS&#8217;s plans for world
domination, and the fact that the number is a listed one (apparently
an oversight on Siegfried&#8217;s part). Unfortunately you and your
colleagues at CONTROL have no other information besides this. Can you
find Siegfried&#8217;s hideout using only this number and a phone
directory? In theoretical computer science this task is known as an
unstructured search. In the worst case, if there are \(n\) entries in
the directory, the computational resources required to find the entry
will be linear in \(n\). Grover (1996) showed how this task could be
done with a quantum algorithm using computational resources on the
order of only \(\sqrt{n}\). Agreed, this &#8220;speed-up&#8221; is
more modest than Shor&#8217;s since unstructured search belongs to the
class \(\mathbf{P}\), but contrary to Shor&#8217;s case, where the
classical complexity of <em>factoring</em> is still unknown, here the
superiority of the quantum algorithm, however modest, is definitely
provable. That this quadratic &#8220;speed-up&#8221; is also
the <em>optimal</em> quantum &#8220;speed-up&#8221; possible for this
problem was proved by Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, &amp; Vazirani
(1997).</p>

<p>
Although the purpose of Grover&#8217;s algorithm is usually described
as &#8220;searching a database&#8221;, it may be more accurate to
describe it as &#8220;inverting a function&#8221;. Roughly speaking,
if we have a function \(y=f(x)\) that can be evaluated on a quantum
computer, Grover&#8217;s algorithm allows us to calculate \(x\) given
\(y\). Inverting a function is related to searching a database because
we could come up with a function that produces a particular value of
\(y\) if \(x\) matches a desired entry in a database, and another
value of \(y\) for other values of \(x\). The applications of this
algorithm are far-reaching (even more so than foiling
Siegfried&#8217;s plans for world domination). For example, it can be
used to determine efficiently the number of solutions to an \(N\)-item
search problem, hence to perform exhaustive searches on a class of
solutions to an <strong>NP</strong>-complete problem and substantially
reduce the computational resources required for solving it.</p>

<h3 id="AdiaAlgo">3.2 Adiabatic Algorithms</h3>

<p>
Many decades have passed since the discovery of the first quantum
algorithm, but so far little progress has been made with respect to
the &#8220;Holy Grail&#8221; of solving an
<strong>NP</strong>-complete problem with a quantum-circuit. In 2000 a
group of physicists from MIT and Northeastern University (Farhi et al.
2000) proposed a novel paradigm for quantum computing that differs
from the circuit model in several interesting ways. Their goal was to
try to solve with this algorithm an instance of the
<em>satisfiability</em> problem (see above), one of the most famous
<strong>NP</strong>-complete problems (Cook 1971).</p>

<p>
According to the adiabatic theorem (e.g. Messiah 1961) and given
certain specific conditions, a quantum system remains in its lowest
energy state, known as the ground state, along an adiabatic
transformation in which the system is deformed slowly and smoothly
from an initial Hamiltonian to a final Hamiltonian (as an
illustration, think of moving a sleeping baby in a cradle from the
living room to the bedroom. If the transition is done slowly and
smoothly enough, and if the baby is a sound sleeper, then it will
remain asleep during the whole transition). The most important
condition in this theorem is the energy gap between the ground state
and the next excited state (in our analogy, this gap reflects how
sound asleep the baby is). Being inversely proportional to the
evolution time \(T\), this gap controls the latter. If this gap exists
during the entire evolution (i.e., there is no level crossing between
the energy states of the system), the theorem dictates that in the
adiabatic limit (when \(T\rightarrow \infty)\) the system will remain
in its ground state. In practice, of course, \(T\) is always finite,
but the longer it is, the less likely it is that the system will
deviate from its ground state during the time evolution.</p>

<p>
The crux of the quantum adiabatic algorithm which rests on this
theorem lies in the possibility of encoding a specific instance of a
given decision problem in a certain Hamiltonian (this can be done by
capitalising on the well-known fact that any decision problem can be
derived from an optimisation problem by incorporating into it a
numerical bound as an additional parameter). One then starts the
system in a ground state of another Hamiltonian which is easy to
construct, and slowly evolves the system in time, deforming it towards
the desired Hamiltonian. According to the quantum adiabatic theorem
and given the gap condition, the result of such a physical process is
another energy ground state that encodes the solution to the desired
decision problem. The adiabatic algorithm is thus a rather &#8216;laid
back&#8217; algorithm: one needs only to start the system in its
ground state, deform it adiabatically, and measure its final ground
state in order to retrieve the desired result. But whether or not this
algorithm yields the desired &#8220;speed-up&#8221; depends crucially
on the behaviour of the energy gap as the number of degrees of freedom
in the system increases. If this gap decreases exponentially with the
size of the input, then the evolution time of the algorithm will
increase exponentially; if the gap decreases polynomially, the
decision problem so encoded could be solved efficiently in polynomial
time. Although physicists have been studying spectral gaps for almost
a century, they have never done so with quantum computing in mind. How
this gap behaves <em>in general</em> remains thus far an open
empirical question.</p>

<p>
The quantum adiabatic algorithm holds much promise (Farhi et al.
2001). It has been shown (Aharonov et al. 2008) to be polynomially
equivalent to the circuit model (that is, each model can simulate the
other with only polynomial overhead in the number of qubits and
computational steps), but the caveat that is sometimes left
unmentioned is that its application to an intractable computational
problem may sometimes require solving another, as intractable a task
(this general worry was first raised by a philosopher; see Pitowsky
(1990)). Indeed, Reichardt (2004) has shown that there are simple
problems for which the algorithm will get stuck in a local minimum, in
which there are exponentially many eigenvalues all exponentially close
to the ground state energy, so applying the adiabatic theorem, even
for these simple problems, will take exponential time, and we are back
to square one.</p>

<h3 id="MeasBaseAlgo">3.3 Measurement-Based Algorithms</h3>

<p>
Measurement-based algorithms differ from circuit algorithms in that
instead of employing unitary evolution as the basic mechanism for the
manipulation of information, these algorithms essentially make use of
non-unitary measurements in the course of a computation. They are
especially interesting from a foundational perspective because they
have no evident classical analogues and because they offer new insight
on the role of
 <a href="../qt-entangle/index.html">entanglement</a>
 in quantum computing (Jozsa 2006). They may also have interesting
engineering-related consequences, suggesting a different kind of
computer architecture which is more fault tolerant (Nielsen and Dawson
2005).</p>

<p>
Measurement-based algorithms fall into two categories. The first is
teleportation quantum computing (based on an idea of Gottesman and
Chuang (1999), and developed into a computational model by Nielsen
(2003) and Leung (2004)). The second is the &#8220;one way quantum
computer&#8221;, known also as the &#8220;cluster state&#8221; model
(Raussendorf and Briegel 2002). The interesting feature of these
models is that they are able to simulate arbitrary quantum dynamics,
including unitary dynamics, using basic non-unitary measurements. The
measurements are performed on a pool of highly entangled states and
are adaptive, i.e., each measurement is done in a different basis
which is calculated classically, given the result of earlier
measurements.</p>

<p>
Exotic models such as these might seem redundant, especially since
they have been shown to be polynomially equivalent to the standard
circuit model in terms of computational complexity (Raussendorf,
Browne, and Briegel 2003). Their merit, however, lies in the
foundational lessons they drive home: with these models the separation
between the classical (i.e., the calculation of the next
measurement-basis) and quantum (i.e., measurements on the entangled
qubits) parts of the computation becomes evident, hence it may be
easier to pinpoint the quantum resources that are responsible for the
putative &#8220;speed-up&#8221;.</p>

<h3 id="TopoQuanFielTheoTQFTAlgo">3.4 Topological-Quantum-Field-Theory (TQFT) Algorithms</h3>

<p>
Another exotic model for quantum computing which has attracted a lot
of attention, especially from Microsoft inc. (Freedman 1998), is the
Topological Quantum Field Theory model. In contrast to the easily
visualisable circuit model, this model resides in the most abstract
reaches of theoretical physics. The exotic physical systems TQFT
describes are topological states of matter. That the formalism of TQFT
can be applied to computational problems was shown by Witten (1989)
and the idea was later developed by others. The model has been proved
to be efficiently simulatable on a standard quantum computer
(Freedman, Kitaev, and Wang 2002; Aharonov, Jones, and Landau 2009).
Its main merit lies in its high tolerance to the errors which are
inevitably introduced in the implementation of a large scale quantum
computer (see below). Topology is especially helpful here because many
global topological properties are, by definition, invariant under
deformation, and given that most errors are local, information encoded
in topological properties is robust against them.</p>

<h2 id="Real">4 Realisations</h2>

<p>
The quantum computer might be the theoretician&#8217;s dream, but as
far as experimentalists are concerned, its realisation is a nightmare.
The problem is that while some prototypes of the simplest elements
needed to build a quantum computer have already been implemented in
the laboratory, it is still an open question how to combine these
elements into scalable systems (see Van Meter and Horsman 2013).
Shor&#8217;s algorithm may break RSA encryption, but it will remain an
anecdote if the largest number that it can factor is 15. In the
circuit-based model the problem is to achieve a scalable quantum
system that at the same time will allow one to (1) robustly represent
quantum information with (2) a time to decoherence significantly
longer than the length of the computation, (3) implement a universal
family of unitary transformations, (4) prepare a fiducial initial
state, and (5) measure the output result (these are DiVincenzo
(2000)&#8217;s five criteria). Alternative paradigms may trade some of
these requirements with others, but the gist will remain the same,
i.e., one would have to achieve control of one&#8217;s quantum system
in such a way that the system will remain &#8220;quantum&#8221; albeit
macroscopic or at least mesoscopic in its dimensions.</p>

<p>
In order to deal with these challenges, several ingenious solutions
have been devised, including quantum error correction codes and fault
tolerant computation (Shor 1995; Shor and DiVincenzo 1996; Aharonov
and Ben-Or 1997; Raussendorf, Harrington, and Goyal 2008; Horsman et
al. 2012; De Beaudrap and Horsman 2019) which can dramatically reduce
the spread of errors during a &#8216;noisy&#8217; quantum computation.
An important criticism of these active error correction schemes,
however, is that they are devised for a very unrealistic noise model
which treats the computer as quantum and the environment as classical
(Alicki, Lidar, and Zinardi 2006). Once a more realistic noise model
is allowed, the feasibility of large scale, fault tolerant and
computationally superior quantum computers is less clear (Hagar 2009;
Tabakin 2017).</p>

<p>
In the near term, a promising avenue for realising a quantum advantage
in a limited number of problem domains is the Noisy Intermediate-Scale
Quantum (NISQ) paradigm (Preskill 2018). The NISQ paradigm does not
employ any error correction mechanisms (postponing the problem to
implement scalable versions of these to the future) but rather focuses
on building computational components, and on tackling computational
problems, which are inherently more resilient to noise. These include,
for example, certain classes of optimisation problems, quantum
semidefinite programming, and digital quantum simulation (Tacchino et
al. 2019). A caveat here is that as the resiliency to noise of a
circuit increases, the more classically it behaves. Nevertheless,
research into NISQ computing is believed to be on track to realise a
50&ndash;100 qubit machine&#8212;large enough to achieve a quantum advantage
over known classical alternatives for the envisioned
applications&#8212;within the next 5&ndash;10 years.</p>

<p>
As mentioned, one of the envisioned applications of NISQ computing is
for digital quantum simulation (i.e. simulation using a gate-based
programmable quantum computer). There is an older tradition of
<em>analog</em> quantum simulation, however, wherein one utilises a
quantum system whose dynamics resemble the dynamics of a particular
target system of interest. Although it is believed that digital
quantum simulation will eventually supersede it, the field of analog
quantum simulation has progressed substantially in the years since it
was first proposed, and analog quantum simulators have already been
used to study quantum dynamics in regimes thought to be beyond the
reach of classical simulators (see, e.g., Bernien et al. (2017); for
further discussion of the philosophical issues involved, see
Hangleiter, Carolan, and Th&#233;bault (2017)).</p>

<h2 id="PhilQues">5. Philosophical Questions</h2>

<h3 id="WhatQuanQuanComp">5.1 What is <em>Quantum</em> in Quantum Computing?</h3>

<p>
Notwithstanding the excitement around the discovery of Shor&#8217;s
algorithm, and putting aside the presently insurmountable problem of
practically realising and implementing a large scale quantum computer,
a crucial theoretical question remains open: What physical resources
are responsible for quantum computing&#8217;s putative power? Put
another way, what are the essential features of quantum mechanics that
would in principle allow one to solve problems or simulate certain
systems more efficiently than on a classical computer? A number of
candidates have been put forward. Fortnow (2003) posits interference
as the key, though it has been suggested that this is not truly a
quantum phenomenon (Spekkens 2007). Jozsa (1997) and many others point
to entanglement, although there are purported counter-examples to this
thesis (see, e.g., Linden and Popescu (1999), Gottesman (1999), Biham
et al. (2004), and finally see Cuffaro (2017) for a philosophical
discussion). Howard et al. (2014) appeal to quantum contextuality. For
Bub (2010) the answer lies in the logical structure of quantum
mechanics (cf. Pitowsky 1989). Duwell (2018) argues for quantum
parallelism, and for Deutsch (1997) and Hewitt-Horsman (2009) it is
&#8220;parallel worlds&#8221; which are the resource.</p>

<p>
Speculative as it may seem, the question &#8220;what is
<em>quantum</em> in quantum computing?&#8221; has significant
practical consequences. One of the embarrassments of quantum computing
is the paucity of quantum algorithms which have actually been
discovered. It is almost certain that one of the reasons for this is
the lack of a full understanding of what makes a quantum computer
quantum (see also Preskill (1998) and Shor (2004)). As an ultimate
answer to this question one would like to have something similar to
Bell&#8217;s famous
 <a href="../bell-theorem/index.html">theorem</a>,
 i.e., a succinct crisp statement of the fundamental difference
between quantum and classical systems. Quantum computers,
unfortunately, do not seem to allow such a simple characterisation
(see Cuffaro 2017, 2018a). Quantum computing skeptics (Levin 2003)
happily capitalise on this puzzle: If no one knows <em>why</em>
quantum computers are superior to classical ones, how can we be sure
that they <em>are</em>, indeed, superior?</p>

<h4>5.1.1 The Debate over Parallelism and Many Worlds</h4> 

<p>
The answer that has tended to dominate the popular literature on
quantum computing is motivated by evolutions such as: </p>

<span class="math display">\[\tag{2}
 \Sigma_{x} \lvert x\rangle \lvert 0\rangle \rightarrow \Sigma_{x}
        \lvert x\rangle \lvert f(x)\rangle,\]</span>

<p>
which were common to many early quantum algorithms. Note the
appearance that \(f\) is evaluated for each of its possible inputs
simultaneously. The idea that we should take this at face
value&#8212;that quantum computers <em>actually do</em> compute a
function for many different input values simultaneously&#8212;is what
Duwell (2018) calls the <em>Quantum Parallelism Thesis</em>
(QPT). For Deutsch, who accepts it as true, the only reasonable
explanation for the QPT is that the <a href="../qm-manyworlds/index.html">many
worlds interpretation</a> (MWI) of quantum mechanics is also true. For
Deutsch, a quantum computer in superposition, like any other quantum
system, exists in some sense in many classical universes
simultaneously. These provide the physical arena within which the
computer effects its parallel computations. This conclusion is
defended by Hewitt-Horsman (2009) and by Wallace (2012). Wallace
notes, however, that the QPT&#8212;and hence the explanatory need for
many worlds&#8212;may not be true of all or even most quantum
algorithms.</p>

<p>
For Steane (2003), in contrast, quantum computers are not well
described in terms of many worlds or even quantum parallelism. Among
other things, Steane argues that the motivation for the QPT is at
least partly due to misleading aspects of the standard quantum
formalism. Additionally, comparing the information actually produced
by quantum and classical algorithms (state collapse entails that only
one evaluation instance in (2) is ever accessible, while a classical
computer must actually produce every instance) suggests that quantum
algorithms perform not more but fewer, cleverer, computations than
classical algorithms (see, also, section 5.1.2  below).</p>

<p>
Another critic is Duwell, who (contra Steane) accepts the QPT (Duwell
2018a), but nevertheless denies that it uniquely supports the MWI
(Duwell 2007). Considering the phase relations between the terms in a
superposition such as (2) is crucially important when evaluating a
quantum algorithm&#8217;s computational efficiency. Phase relations,
however, are global properties of a state. Thus a quantum computation,
Duwell argues, does not consist <em>solely</em> of local parallel
computations. But in this case, the QPT does not uniquely support the
MWI over other explanations.</p>

<p>
Defending the MWI, Hewitt-Horsman (2009) argues (contra Steane) that
to state that quantum computers do not actually generate each of the
evaluation instances represented in (2) is false according to the
view: on the MWI such information could be extracted in principle
given sufficiently advanced technology. Further, Hewitt-Horsman
emphasises that the MWI is not motivated simply by a suggestive
mathematical representation. Worlds on the MWI are defined according
to their explanatory usefulness, manifested in particular by their
stability and independence over the time scales relevant to the
computation. Wallace (2012) argues similarly.</p>

<p>
Cuffaro (2012) and Aaronson (2013b) point out that the Many Worlds
Explanation of Quantum Computing (MWQC) and the MWI are not actually
identical. The latter employs
 <a href="../qm-decoherence/index.html">decoherence</a>
 as a criterion for distinguishing macroscopic worlds from one
another. Quantum circuit model algorithms, however, utilise
<em>coherent</em> superpositions. To distinguish computational worlds,
therefore, one must weaken the decoherence criterion, but Cuffaro
argues that this move is ad hoc. Further, Cuffaro argues that the MWQC
is for all practical purposes incompatible with
 <a href="#MeasBaseAlgo">measurement based computation</a>,
 for even granting a weakened world identification criterion, there is
no natural way in this model to identify worlds that are stable and
independent in the way required.</p>

<h4>5.1.2 The Elusive Nature of Speed-Up</h4>

<p>
Even if we could rule out the MWQC, the problem of finding the
physical resource(s) responsible for quantum &#8220;speed-up&#8221;
would remain a difficult one. Consider a solution of a decision
problem, say <em>satisfiability</em>, with a quantum algorithm based
on the circuit model. What we are given here as input is a proposition
in the propositional calculus and we have to decide whether it has a
satisfying truth assignment. As Pitowsky (2002) shows, the quantum
algorithm appears to solve this problem by testing all \(2^{n}\)
assignments &#8220;at once&#8221; as suggested by (2), yet this
quantum &#8216;miracle&#8217; helps us very little since, as
previously mentioned, any measurement performed on the output state
collapses it, and if there is one possible truth assignment that
solves this decision problem, the probability of retrieving it is
\(2^{-n}\), just as in the case of a classical probabilistic Turing
machine which guesses the solution and then checks it.
Pitowsky&#8217;s conclusion (echoed, as we saw, by Steane (2003) and
Duwell (2007)) is that in order to enhance computation with quantum
mechanics we must construct &#8216;clever&#8217; superpositions that
increase the probability of successfully retrieving the result far
more than that of a pure guess. Shor&#8217;s algorithm and the class
of algorithms that evaluate a <em>global</em> property of a function
(this class is known as the <em>hidden subgroup</em> class of
algorithms) are (so far) a unique example of both a construction of
such &#8216;clever&#8217; superpositions and a retrieval of the
solution in polynomial time. The quantum adiabatic algorithm may give
us similar results, contingent upon the existence of an energy gap
that decreases polynomially with the input.</p>

<p>
This question also raises important issues about how to measure the
complexity of a given quantum algorithm. The answer differs, of
course, according to the particular model at hand. In the adiabatic
model, for example, one needs only to estimate the energy gap
behaviour and its relation to the input size (encoded in the number of
degrees of freedom of the Hamiltonian of the system). In the
measurement-based model, one counts the number of measurements needed
to reveal the solution that is hidden in the input cluster state
(since the preparation of the cluster state is a polynomial process,
it does not add to the complexity of the computation). But in the
circuit model things are not as straightforward. After all, the whole
of the quantum-circuit-based computation can be be simply represented
as a <em>single</em> unitary transformation from the input state to
the output state.</p>

<p>
This feature of the quantum circuit model supports the conjecture that
the power of quantum computers, if any, lies not in quantum dynamics
(i.e., in the Schr&#246;dinger equation), but rather in the quantum
state, or the wave function. Another argument in favour of this
conjecture is that the Hilbert subspace &#8220;visited&#8221; during a
quantum computational process is, at any moment, a linear space
spanned by all of the vectors in the total Hilbert space which have
been created by the computational process up to that moment. But this
Hilbert subspace is thus a subspace spanned by a polynomial number of
vectors and is thus at most a polynomial subspace of the total Hilbert
space. A classical simulation of the quantum evolution on a Hilbert
space with polynomial number of dimensions (that is, a Hilbert space
spanned by a number of basis vectors which is polynomial in the number
of qubits involved in the computation), however, can be carried out in
a polynomial number of classical computations. Were quantum
<em>dynamics</em> the sole ingredient responsible to the efficiency of
quantum computing, the latter could be mimicked in a polynomial number
of steps with a classical computer (see, e.g. Vidal 2003).</p>

<p>
This is not to say that quantum computation is no more powerful than
classical computation. The key point, of course, is that one does not
end a quantum computation with an arbitrary superposition, but aims
for a very special, &#8216;clever&#8217; state&#8212;to use
Pitowsky&#8217;s term. Quantum computations may not <em>always</em> be
mimicked with a classical computer because the characterisation of the
computational subspace of certain quantum states is difficult, and it
seems that these special, &#8216;clever&#8217;, quantum states cannot
be classically represented as vectors derivable via a quantum
computation in an optimal basis, or at least that one cannot do so in
such way that would allow one to calculate the outcome of the final
measurement made on these states.</p>

<p>
Consequently, in the quantum circuit model one should count the number
of computational steps in the computation not by counting the number
of transformations of the state, but by counting the number of one- or
two-qubit local transformations that are required to create the
&#8216;clever&#8217; superposition that ensures the desired
&#8220;speed-up&#8221;. (Note that Shor&#8217;s algorithm, for
example, involves three major steps in this context: First, one
creates the &#8216;clever&#8217; entangled state with a set of unitary
transformations. The result of the computation&#8212;a global property
of a function&#8212;is now &#8216;hidden&#8217; in this state; second,
in order to retrieve this result, one projects it on a subspace of the
Hilbert space, and finally one performs another set of unitary
transformations in order to make the result measurable in the original
computational basis. <em>All</em> these steps count as
<em>computational</em> steps as far as the efficiency of the algorithm
is concerned. See also Bub (2006b).) The trick is to perform these
local one- or two-qubit transformations in polynomial time, and it is
likely that it is here where the physical power of quantum computing
may be found.</p>

<h3 id="ExpeMeta">5.2 Experimental Metaphysics?</h3>

<p>
The quantum information revolution has prompted several physicists and
philosophers to claim that new insights can be gained from the rising
new science into conceptual problems in the foundations of quantum
mechanics (see, e.g., Bub (2016), Chiribella and Spekkens (2016); for
responses and commentaries, see, e.g., Myrvold (2010), Timpson (2013),
Felline (2016), Cuffaro (forthcoming), Duwell (forthcoming), Felline
(forthcoming-a), Henderson (forthcoming), Koberinski and M&#252;ller
(2018)). Yet while one of the most famous foundational problems in
quantum mechanics, namely
 <a href="../qt-issues/index.html#MeasProb">the quantum measurement problem</a>,
 remains unsolved even within quantum information theory (see Hagar
 (2003), Hagar and Hemmo (2006), and Felline (forthcoming-b) for a
 critique of the quantum information theoretic approach to the
 foundations of quantum mechanics and the role of the quantum
 measurement problem in this context), some quantum information
 theorists dismiss it as a philosophical quibble (Fuchs 2002). Indeed,
 in quantum information theory the concept of
 &#8220;measurement&#8221; is taken as a primitive, a &#8220;black
 box&#8221; which remains unanalysed. The measurement problem itself,
 furthermore, is regarded as a misunderstanding of quantum theory. But
 recent advances in the realisation of a large scale quantum computer
 may eventually prove quantum information theorists wrong: Rather than
 supporting the dismissal of the quantum measurement problem, these
 advances may surprisingly lead to its empirical solution.</p>

<p>
The speculative idea is the following. As it turns
out, <a href="../qm-collapse/index.html">collapse theories</a>&#8212;one form of
alternatives to quantum theory which aim to solve the measurement
problem&#8212;modify Schr&#246;dinger&#8217;s equation and give
different predictions from quantum theory in certain specific
circumstances. These circumstances can be realised, moreover,
if <a href="../qm-decoherence/index.html">decoherence</a> effects can be
suppressed (Bassi, Adler, &amp; Ippoliti 2004). Now one of the most
difficult obstacles that await the construction of a large scale
quantum computer is its robustness against decoherence effects (Unruh
1995). It thus appears that the technological capabilities required
for the realisation of a large scale quantum computer are potentially
related to those upon which the distinction between &#8220;true&#8221;
and &#8220;false&#8221; collapse (Pearle 1997), i.e., between collapse
theories and environmentally induced decoherence, is
contingent. Consequently the physical realisation of a large-scale
quantum computer, if it were of the right architecture, could
potentially shed light on one of the long standing conceptual problems
in the foundations of the theory, and if so this would serve as yet
another example of experimental metaphysics (the term was coined by
Abner Shimony to designate the chain of events that led
from <a href="../qt-epr/index.html">the EPR argument</a>
via <a href="../bell-theorem/index.html">Bell&#8217;s theorem</a> to
Aspect&#8217;s experiments). Note, however, that as just mentioned,
one would need to consider the computer&#8217;s architecture before
making any metaphysical conclusions. The computer architecture is
important because while dynamical collapse theories tend to collapse
superpositions involving the positions of macroscopic quantities of
mass, they tend not to collapse large complicated superpositions of
photon polarisation or spin.</p>

<h3 id="QuanCaus">5.3 Quantum Causality</h3>

<p>
Is quantum mechanics compatible with the principle of causality? This
is an old question&#8212;indeed one of the very first interpretational
questions confronted by the early commentators on the theory (Hermann
2017; Schlick 1961, 1962). The contemporary literature continues to
exhibit considerable skepticism in regards to the prospects of
explaining quantum phenomena causally (Hausman &amp; Woodward 1999;
Van Fraassen 1982; Woodward 2007), or at any rate <em>locally</em>
causally, especially in the wake
of <a href="../bell-theorem/index.html">Bell&#8217;s theorem</a> (Myrvold
2016). As a result of some fascinating theoretical work (Allen,
Barrett, Horsman, Lee, &amp; Spekkens 2017; Costa &amp; Shrapnel 2016;
Shrapnel 2017), however, it seems that the prospects for a locally
causal explanation of quantum phenomena are not quite as hopeless as
they may initially have seemed, at least in the context of
an <a href="../causation-mani/index.html">interventionist</a> theory of
causation. This is not to say that decades of physical and
philosophical investigations into the consequences of Bell&#8217;s
theorem have all been mistaken, of course. For one thing, the
interventionist frameworks utilised in this new work are
operationalist, thus the relevance of this work to so-called hidden
variables theories of quantum mechanics is unclear. Second, the
interventionist frameworks utilised are not classical, and neither is
the kind of causality they explicate. Indeed, in regard to the latter
point, it is arguably the key insight emerging from this work that the
frameworks previously utilised for analysing interventionist causation
in the quantum context are inappropriate to that context. In contrast
to a classical interventionist framework in which events are thought
of as primitive (i.e. as not further analysable), events in these
generalised frameworks are characterised as <em>processes</em> with
associated inputs and outputs. Specifically, one characterises quantum
events using a concept from quantum computation and information theory
called a <em>quantum channel</em>. And within this generalised
interventionist framework, causal models of quantum phenomena can be
given which do not need to posit non-local causal influences, and
which satisfy certain other desiderata typically required in a causal
model (in particular that such a model respect the causal Markov
condition and that it not require &#8216;fine-tuning&#8217;; see
Shrapnel (2017)).</p>

<h3 id="QuanCompPersPhysScie">5.4 (Quantum) Computational Perspectives on Physical Science</h3>

<p>
Physics is traditionally conceived as a primarily
&#8220;theoretical&#8221; activity, in the sense that it is generally
thought to be the goal of physics to tell us, even if only indirectly
(Fuchs (2002), pp. 5&ndash;6, Fuchs (2010), pp. 22&ndash;3), what the world is
like independently of ourselves. This is not the case with every
science. Chemistry, for example, is arguably best thought of as a
&#8220;practically&#8221; oriented discipline concerned with the ways
in which systems can be manipulated for particular purposes
(Bensaude-Vincent (2009)). Even within physics, there are
sub-disciplines which are best construed in this way (Myrvold 2011;
Wallace 2014; Ladyman 2018), and indeed, some (though at present these
are still a minority) have even sought to (re-)characterise physics as
a whole in something like this way, i.e. as a science of possible as
opposed to impossible transformations (Deutsch 2013).</p>

<p>
Elaborating upon ideas which one can glean from Pitowsky&#8217;s work
(1990, 1996, 2002), Cuffaro argues at length that quantum computation
and information theory (QCIT) are practical sciences in this sense, as
opposed to the &#8220;theoretical sciences&#8221; exemplified by
physics under its traditional characterisation; further that
recognising this distinction illuminates both areas of activity. On
the one hand (Cuffaro 2017), practical investigators attempting to
isolate and/or quantify the computational resources made available by
quantum computers are in danger of conceptual confusion if they are
not cognisant of the differences between practical and traditional
sciences. On the other hand (Cuffaro 2018a), one should be wary of the
significance of classical computer simulations of quantum mechanical
phenomena for the purposes of a foundational analysis of the latter.
For example, certain mathematical results can legitimately be thought
of as no-go theorems for the purposes of foundational analysis, and
yet are not really relevant for the purpose of characterising the
class of efficiently simulable quantum phenomena.</p>

<h3 id="ChurTuriThesDeutPrin">5.5 The Church-Turing Thesis and Deutsch&#8217;s Principle</h3>

<p>
The Church-Turing thesis, which asserts that every function naturally
regarded as computable is Turing-computable, is argued by Deutsch to
presuppose a physical principle, namely that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[DP]: Every finitely realisable physical system can be perfectly
simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite
means. (Deutsch 1985)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since no machine operating by finite means can simulate classical
physics&#8217; continuity of states and dynamics, Deutsch argues that
DP is false in a classical world. He argues that it is true for
quantum physics, however, owing to the existence of the universal
quantum Turing machine he introduces in the same paper, which thus
proves both DP and the Church-Turing thesis it underlies to be sound.
This idea&#8212;that the Church-Turing thesis requires a physical
grounding&#8212;is set into historical context by Lupacchini (2018),
who traces its roots in the thought of G&#246;del, Post, and Gandy. It
is criticised by Timpson (2013), who views it as methodologically
fruitful, but as nevertheless resting on a confusion regarding the
meaning of the Church-Turing thesis, which in itself has nothing to do
with physics.</p>

<h3 id="QuanCompScieExpl">5.6 (Quantum) Computation and Scientific Explanation</h3>

<p>
In the general philosophy of science literature on
 <a href="../scientific-explanation/index.html">scientific explanation</a>
 there is a distinction between so-called &#8220;how-actually&#8221;
and &#8220;how-possibly&#8221; explanation, where the former aims to
convey how a particular outcome actually came about, and the latter
aims to convey how the occurrence of an event can have been possible.
That how-actually explanation actually explains is uncontroversial,
but the merit (if any) of how-possibly explanation has been debated.
While some view how-possibly explanation as genuinely explanatory,
others have argued that how-possibly &#8216;explanation&#8217; is
better thought of as, at best, a merely heuristically useful
exercise.</p>

<p>
It turns out that the science of quantum computation is able to
illuminate this debate. Cuffaro (2015) argues that when one examines
the question of the source of quantum &#8220;speed-up&#8221;, one sees
that to answer this question is to compare algorithmic processes of
various kinds, and in so doing to describe the possibility spaces
associated with these processes. By doing so one explains how it is
possible for one process to outperform its rival. Further, Cuffaro
argues that in examples like this, once one has answered the
how-possibly question, nothing is actually gained by subsequently
asking a how-actually question.</p>

<h3 id="TherCompKind">5.7 Are There Computational Kinds?</h3>

<p>
Finally, another philosophical implication of the realisation of a
large scale quantum computer regards the long-standing debate in the
philosophy of mind on the autonomy of computational theories of the
mind (Fodor 1974). In the shift from strong to weak artificial
intelligence, the advocates of this view tried to impose constraints
on computer programs before they could qualify as theories of
cognitive science (Pylyshyn 1984). These constraints include, for
example, the nature of physical realisations of symbols and the
relations between abstract symbolic computations and the physical
causal processes that execute them. The search for the computational
feature of these theories, i.e., for what makes them
<em>computational</em> theories of the mind, involved isolating some
features of the computer <em>as such</em>. In other words, the
advocates of weak AI were looking for computational properties, or
kinds, that would be <em>machine independent</em>, at least in the
sense that they would not be associated with the physical constitution
of the computer, nor with the specific machine model that was being
used. These features were thought to be instrumental in debates within
cognitive science, e.g., the debate between functionalism and
connectionism (Fodor and Pylyshyn 1988).</p>

<p>
Note, however, that once the physical Church-Turing thesis is
violated, arguably some computational notions cease to be autonomous.
In other words, given that quantum computers may be able to
efficiently solve classically intractable problems, hence re-describe
the abstract space of computational complexity (Bernstein and Vazirani
1997), computational concepts and even computational kinds such as
&#8216;an efficient algorithm&#8217; or &#8216;the class NP&#8217;,
become machine-dependent, and recourse to &#8216;hardware&#8217;
becomes inevitable in any analysis thereof (Hagar 2007).</p>

<p>
Advances in quantum computing may thus militate against the
functionalist view about the <em>unphysical</em> character of the
types and properties that are used in computer science. In fact, these
types and categories may <em>become</em> physical as a result of this
natural development in physics (e.g., quantum computing, chaos
theory). Consequently, efficient quantum algorithms may also serve as
counterexamples to a-priori arguments against reductionism (Pitowsky
1996).</p>

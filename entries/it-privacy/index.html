<h1>Privacy and Information Technology</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Thu Nov 20, 2014; substantive revision Wed Oct 30, 2019</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Human beings value their privacy and the protection of their personal
sphere of life. They value some control over who knows what about
them. They certainly do not want their personal information to be
accessible to just anyone at any time. But recent advances in
information technology threaten privacy and have reduced the amount of
control over personal data and open up the possibility of a range of
negative consequences as a result of access to personal data. In the
second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century data protection regimes
have been put in place as a response to increasing levels of
processing of personal data. The 21<sup>st</sup> century has become
the century of big data and advanced information technology (e.g.
forms of deep learning), the rise of big tech companies and the
platform economy, which comes with the storage and processing of
exabytes of data.</p>

<p>
The revelations of Edward Snowden, and more recently the Cambridge
Analytica case (Cadwalladr &amp; Graham-Harrison 2018) have
demonstrated that worries about negative consequences are real. The
technical capabilities to collect, store and search large quantities
of data concerning telephone conversations, internet searches and
electronic payment are now in place and are routinely used by
government agencies and corporate actors alike. The rise of China and
the large scale of use and spread of advanced digital technologies for
surveillance and control have only added to the concern of many. For
business firms, personal data about customers and potential customers
are now also a key asset. The scope and purpose of the personal data
centred business models of Big Tech (Google, Amazon, Facebook,
Microsoft, Apple) has been described in detail by Shoshana Zuboff
(2018) under the label &ldquo;surveillance capitalism&rdquo;. </p>

<p>
At the same time, the meaning and value of privacy remains the subject
of considerable controversy. The combination of increasing power of
new technology and the declining clarity and agreement on privacy give
rise to problems concerning law, policy and ethics. Many of these
conceptual debates and issues are situated in the context of
interpretation and analysis of the General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) that was adopted by the EU in spring 2018 as the successor of
the EU 1995 Directives, with application far beyond the borders of the
European Union.</p>

<p>
The focus of this article is on exploring the relationship between
information technology and privacy. We will both illustrate the
specific threats that IT and innovations in IT pose for privacy and
indicate how IT <em>itself</em> might be able to overcome these
privacy concerns by being developed in ways that can be termed
&ldquo;privacy-sensitive&rdquo;, &ldquo;privacy enhancing&rdquo; or &ldquo;privacy
respecting&rdquo;. We will also discuss the role of emerging technologies
in the debate, and account for the way in which moral debates are
themselves affected by IT.</p>

<h2><a id="ConPriValPri">1. Conceptions of privacy and the value of privacy</a></h2>

<p>
Discussions about privacy are intertwined with the use of technology.
The publication that began the debate about privacy in the Western
world was occasioned by the introduction of the newspaper printing
press and photography. Samuel D. Warren and Louis Brandeis wrote their
article on privacy in the Harvard Law Review (Warren &amp; Brandeis
1890) partly in protest against the intrusive activities of the
journalists of those days. They argued that there is a &ldquo;right to
be left alone&rdquo; based on a principle of &ldquo;inviolate
personality&rdquo;. Since the publication of that article, the debate
about privacy has been fuelled by claims regarding the right of
individuals to determine the extent to which others have access to
them (Westin 1967) and claims regarding the right of society to know
about individuals. Information being a cornerstone of access to
individuals, the privacy debate has co-evolved with &ndash; and in
response to &ndash; the development of information technology. It is
therefore difficult to conceive of the notions of privacy and
discussions about data protection as separate from the way computers,
the Internet, mobile computing and the many applications of these
basic technologies have evolved.</p>

<h3><a id="ConVsInfPri">1.1 Constitutional vs. informational privacy</a></h3>

<p>
Inspired by subsequent developments in U.S. law, a distinction can be
made between (1) <em>constitutional</em> (or decisional)
<em>privacy</em> and (2) <em>tort</em> (or informational)
<em>privacy</em> (DeCew 1997). The first refers to the freedom to make
one&rsquo;s own decisions without interference by others in regard to
matters seen as intimate and personal, such as the decision to use
contraceptives or to have an abortion. The second is concerned with
the interest of individuals in exercising control over access to
information about themselves and is most often referred to as
&ldquo;informational privacy&rdquo;. Think here, for instance, about
information disclosed on Facebook or other social media. All too
easily, such information might be beyond the control of the
individual.</p>

<p>
Statements about privacy can be either descriptive or normative,
depending on whether they are used to describe the way people define
situations and conditions of privacy and the way they value them, or
are used to indicate that there ought to be constraints on the use of
information or information processing. These conditions or constraints
typically involve personal information regarding individuals, or ways
of information processing that may affect individuals. Informational
privacy in a normative sense refers typically to a non-absolute moral
right of persons to have direct or indirect control over access to (1)
information about oneself, (2) situations in which others could
acquire information about oneself, and (3) technology that can be used
to generate, process or disseminate information about oneself.</p>

<h3><a id="AccValPri">1.2 Accounts of the value of privacy</a></h3>

<p>
The debates about privacy are almost always revolving around new
technology, ranging from genetics and the extensive study of
bio-markers, brain imaging, drones, wearable sensors and sensor
networks, social media, smart phones, closed circuit television, to
government cybersecurity programs, direct marketing, RFID tags, Big
Data, head-mounted displays and search engines. There are basically
two reactions to the flood of new technology and its impact on
personal information and privacy: the first reaction, held by many
people in IT industry and in R&amp;D, is that we have zero privacy in
the digital age and that there is no way we can protect it, so we
should get used to the new world and get over it (Sprenger 1999). The other reaction
is that our privacy is more important than ever and that we can and we
must attempt to protect it.</p>

<p>
In the literature on privacy, there are many competing accounts of the
nature and value of privacy (Negley 1966, R&ouml;ssler 2005). On one end of
the spectrum, <em>reductionist</em> accounts argue that privacy claims
are really about other values and other things that matter from a
moral point of view. According to these views the value of privacy is
reducible to these other values or sources of value (Thomson 1975).
Proposals that have been defended along these lines mention property
rights, security, autonomy, intimacy or friendship, democracy,
liberty, dignity, or utility and economic value. Reductionist accounts
hold that the importance of privacy should be explained and its
meaning clarified in terms of those other values and sources of value
(Westin 1967). The opposing view holds that privacy is valuable in
itself and its value and importance are not derived from other
considerations (see for a discussion R&ouml;ssler 2004). Views that
construe privacy and the personal sphere of life as a human right
would be an example of this non-reductionist conception.</p>

<p>
More recently a type of privacy account has been proposed in relation
to new information technology, which acknowledges that there is a
cluster of related moral claims underlying appeals to privacy, but
maintains that there is no single essential core of privacy
concerns. This approach is referred to as cluster accounts (DeCew
1997; Solove 2006; van den Hoven 1999; Allen 2011; Nissenbaum
2004).</p>

<p>
From a descriptive perspective, a recent further addition to the body of
privacy accounts are epistemic accounts, where the notion of privacy
is analyzed primarily in terms of knowledge or other epistemic states.
Having privacy means that others don&rsquo;t know certain private
propositions; lacking privacy means that others do know certain
private propositions (Blaauw 2013). An important aspect of this
conception of having privacy is that it is seen as a relation (Rubel
2011; Matheson 2007; Blaauw 2013) with three argument places: a
subject (<i>S</i>), a set of propositions (<i>P</i>) and a set of
individuals (<i>I</i>). Here <i>S</i> is the subject who has (a
certain degree of) privacy. <i>P</i> is composed of those propositions
the subject wants to keep private (call the propositions in this set
&lsquo;personal propositions&rsquo;), and <i>I</i> is composed of
those individuals with respect to whom <i>S</i> wants to keep the
personal propositions private.</p>

<p>
Another distinction that is useful to make is the one between a
European and a US American approach. A bibliometric study suggests
that the two approaches are separate in the literature. The first
conceptualizes issues of informational privacy in terms of &lsquo;data
protection&rsquo;, the second in terms of &lsquo;privacy&rsquo;
(Heersmink et al. 2011). In discussing the relationship of privacy
matters with technology, the notion of data protection is most
helpful, since it leads to a relatively clear picture of what the
object of protection is and by which technical means the data can be
protected. At the same time it invites answers to the question why the
data ought to be protected, pointing to a number of distinctive moral
grounds on the basis of which technical, legal and institutional
protection of personal data can be justified. Informational privacy is
thus recast in terms of the protection of personal data (van den Hoven
2008). This account shows how Privacy, Technology and Data Protection
are related, without conflating Privacy and Data Protection.</p>

<h3><a id="PerDat">1.3 Personal Data</a></h3>

<p>
Personal information or data is information or data that is linked or
can be linked to individual persons. Examples include explicitly
stated characteristics such as a person&lsquo;s date of birth, sexual
preference, whereabouts, religion, but also the IP address of your
computer or metadata pertaining to these kinds of information. In
addition, personal data can also be more implicit in the form of
behavioural data, for example from social media, that can be linked to
individuals. Personal data can be contrasted with data that is
considered sensitive, valuable or important for other reasons, such as
secret recipes, financial data, or military intelligence. Data used to
secure other information, such as passwords, are not considered
here. Although such security measures (passwords) may contribute to
privacy, their protection is only instrumental to the protection of
other (more private) information, and the quality of such security
measures is therefore out of the scope of our considerations here.</p>

<p>
A relevant distinction that has been made in philosophical semantics
is that between the referential and the attributive use of descriptive
labels of persons (van den Hoven 2008). Personal data is defined in
the law as data that can be linked with a natural person. There are
two ways in which this link can be made; a referential mode and a
non-referential mode. The law is primarily concerned with the
&lsquo;referential use&rsquo; of descriptions or attributes, the type
of use that is made on the basis of a (possible) acquaintance
relationship of the speaker with the object of his knowledge.
&ldquo;The murderer of Kennedy must be insane&rdquo;, uttered while
pointing to him in court is an example of a referentially used
description. This can be contrasted with descriptions that are used
attributively as in &ldquo;the murderer of Kennedy must be insane,
whoever he is&rdquo;. In this case, the user of the description is
not &ndash; and may never be &ndash; acquainted with the person he is
talking about or intends to refer to. If the legal definition of
personal data is interpreted referentially, much of the data that
could at some point in time be brought to bear on persons would be
unprotected; that is, the processing of this data would not be
constrained on moral grounds related to privacy or personal sphere of
life, since it does not &ldquo;refer&rdquo; to persons in a straightforward
way and therefore does not constitute &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; in a strict
sense. </p>

<h3><a id="MorReaForProPerDat">1.4 Moral reasons for protecting personal data</a></h3>

<p>
The following types of moral reasons for the protection of personal
data and for providing direct or indirect control over access to those
data by others can be distinguished (van den Hoven 2008):</p>

<ol>

<li>Prevention of harm: Unrestricted access by others to one&lsquo;s bank
account, profile, social media account, cloud repositories,
characteristics, and whereabouts can be used to harm the data subject
in a variety of ways.</li>

<li>Informational inequality: Personal data have become commodities.
Individuals are usually not in a good position to negotiate contracts
about the use of their data and do not have the means to check whether
partners live up to the terms of the contract. Data protection laws,
regulation and governance aim at establishing fair conditions for
drafting contracts about personal data transmission and exchange and
providing data subjects with checks and balances, guarantees for
redress and means to monitor compliance with the terms of the
contract. Flexible pricing, price targeting and price gauging, dynamic
negotiations are typically undertaken on the basis of asymmetrical
information and great disparities in access to information. Also
choice modelling in marketing, micro-targeting in political campaigns,
and nudging in policy implementation exploit a basic informational
inequality of principal and agent.</li>

<li>Informational injustice and discrimination: Personal information
provided in one sphere or context (for example, health care) may
change its meaning when used in another sphere or context (such as
commercial transactions) and may lead to discrimination and
disadvantages for the individual. This is related to the discussion on
contextual integrity by Nissenbaum (2004) and Walzerian spheres of
justice (Van den Hoven 2008).</li>

<li>Encroachment on moral autonomy and human dignity: Lack of privacy
may expose individuals to outside forces that influence their choices
and bring them to make decisions they would not have otherwise made.
Mass surveillance leads to a situation where routinely, systematically,
and continuously individuals make choices and decisions because they
know others are watching them. This affects their status as autonomous
beings and has what sometimes is described as a &ldquo;chilling effect&rdquo;
on them and on society. Closely related are considerations of
violations of respect for persons and human dignity. The massive
accumulation of data relevant to a person&lsquo;s identity (e.g. brain-computer interfaces, identity graphs, digital doubles or digital twins, analysis
of the topology of one&lsquo;s social networks) may give rise to the idea
that we know a particular person since there is so much information about
her. It can be argued that being able to figure people out on the
basis of their big data constitutes an epistemic and moral immodesty
(Bruynseels &amp; Van den Hoven 2015), which fails to respect the fact
that human beings are subjects with private mental states that have a
certain quality that is inaccessible from an external perspective
(third or second person perspective) &ndash; however detailed and accurate
that may be. Respecting privacy would then imply a recognition of this
moral phenomenology of human persons, i.e. recognising that a human
being is always more than advanced digital technologies can
deliver.</li>
</ol>

<p>
These considerations all provide good moral reasons for limiting and
constraining access to personal data and providing individuals with
control over their data.</p>

<h3><a id="LawRegIndConOveAcc">1.5 Law, regulation, and indirect control over access</a></h3>

<p>
Acknowledging that there are moral reasons for protecting personal
data, data protection laws are in force in almost all countries. The
basic moral principle underlying these laws is the requirement of
informed consent for processing by the data subject, providing the
subject (at least in principle) with control over potential negative
effects as discussed above. Furthermore, processing of personal
information requires that its purpose be specified, its use be
limited, individuals be notified and allowed to correct inaccuracies,
and the holder of the data be accountable to oversight authorities
(OECD 1980). Because it is impossible to guarantee compliance of all
types of data processing in all these areas and applications with
these rules and laws in traditional ways, so-called
&ldquo;privacy-enhancing technologies&rdquo; (PETs) and identity management
systems are expected to replace human oversight in many cases. The
challenge with respect to privacy in the twenty-first century is to
assure that technology is designed in such a way that it incorporates
privacy requirements in the software, architecture, infrastructure,
and work processes in a way that makes privacy violations unlikely to
occur. New generations of privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR) now require
standardly a &ldquo;privacy by design&rdquo; approach. The data ecosystems and
socio-technical systems, supply chains, organisations, including
incentive structures, business processes, and technical hardware and
software, training of personnel, should all be designed in such a way that
the likelihood of privacy violations is a low as possible.</p>

<h2><a id="ImpInfTecPri">2. The impact of information technology on privacy</a></h2>

<p>
The debates about privacy are almost always revolving around new
technology, ranging from genetics and the extensive study of
bio-markers, brain imaging, drones, wearable sensors and sensor
networks, social media, smart phones, closed circuit television, to
government cybersecurity programs, direct marketing, surveillance,
RFID tags, big data, head-mounted displays and search engines. The
impact of some of these new technologies, with a particular focus on
information technology, is discussed in this section.</p>

<h3><a id="DevInfTec">2.1 Developments in information technology</a></h3>

<p>
&ldquo;Information technology&rdquo; refers to automated systems for
storing, processing, and distributing information. Typically, this
involves the use of computers and communication networks. The amount
of information that can be stored or processed in an information
system depends on the technology used. The capacity of the technology
has increased rapidly over the past decades, in accordance with
Moore&rsquo;s law. This holds for storage capacity, processing capacity, and
communication bandwidth. We are now capable of storing and processing
data on the exabyte level. For illustration, to store 100 exabytes of
data on 720 MB CD-ROM discs would require a stack of them that would
almost reach the moon.</p>

<p>
These developments have fundamentally changed our practices of
information provisioning. The rapid changes have increased the need
for careful consideration of the desirability of effects. Some even
speak of a digital revolution as a technological leap similar to the
industrial revolution, or a digital revolution as a revolution in
understanding human nature and the world, similar to the revolutions
of Copernicus, Darwin and Freud (Floridi 2008). In both the technical
and the epistemic sense, emphasis has been put on connectivity and
interaction. Physical space has become less important, information is
ubiquitous, and social relations have adapted as well.</p>

<p>
As we have described privacy in terms of moral reasons for imposing
constraints on access to and/or use of personal information, the
increased connectivity imposed by information technology poses many
questions. In a descriptive sense, access has increased, which, in a
normative sense, requires consideration of the desirability of this
development, and evaluation of the potential for regulation by
technology (Lessig 1999), institutions, and/or law.</p>

<p>
As connectivity increases access to information, it also increases the
possibility for agents to <em>act</em> based on the new sources of
information. When these sources contain personal information, risks of
harm, inequality, discrimination, and loss of autonomy easily emerge.
For example, your enemies may have less difficulty finding out where
you are, users may be tempted to give up privacy for perceived
benefits in online environments, and employers may use online
information to avoid hiring certain groups of people. Furthermore,
systems rather than users may decide which information is displayed,
thus confronting users only with news that matches their profiles.</p>

<p>
Although the technology operates on a device level, information
technology consists of a complex system of socio-technical practices,
and its context of use forms the basis for discussing its role in
changing possibilities for accessing information, and thereby
impacting privacy. We will discuss some specific developments and
their impact in the following sections.</p>

<h3><a id="Int">2.2 Internet</a></h3>

<p>
The Internet, originally conceived in the 1960s and developed in the
1980s as a scientific network for exchanging information, was not
designed for the purpose of separating information flows (Michener
1999). The World Wide Web of today was not foreseen, and neither was
the possibility of misuse of the Internet. Social network sites
emerged for use within a community of people who knew each other in
real life &ndash; at first, mostly in academic settings &ndash; rather
than being developed for a worldwide community of users (Ellison
2007). It was assumed that sharing with close friends would not cause
any harm, and privacy and security only appeared on the agenda when
the network grew larger. This means that privacy concerns often had to
be dealt with as add-ons rather than by-design.</p>

<p>
A major theme in the discussion of Internet privacy revolves around
the use of cookies (Palmer 2005). Cookies are small pieces of data
that web sites store on the user&rsquo;s computer, in order to enable
personalization of the site. However, some cookies can be used to
track the user across multiple web sites (tracking cookies), enabling
for example advertisements for a product the user has recently viewed
on a totally different site. Again, it is not always clear what the
generated information is used for. Laws requiring user consent for the
use of cookies are not always successful in terms of increasing the
level of control, as the consent requests interfere with task flows,
and the user may simply click away any requests for consent (Leenes
&amp; Kosta 2015). Similarly, features of social network sites
embedded in other sites (e.g. &ldquo;like&rdquo;-button) may allow
the social network site to identify the sites visited by the user
(Krishnamurthy &amp; Wills 2009).</p>

<p>
The recent development of cloud computing increases the many privacy
concerns (Ruiter &amp; Warnier 2011). Previously, whereas information
would be available from the web, user data and programs would still be
stored locally, preventing program vendors from having access to the
data and usage statistics. In cloud computing, both data and programs
are online (in the cloud), and it is not always clear what the
user-generated and system-generated data are used for. Moreover, as
data are located elsewhere in the world, it is not even always obvious
which law is applicable, and which authorities can demand access to
the data. Data gathered by online services and apps such as search
engines and games are of particular concern here. Which data are used
and communicated by applications (browsing history, contact lists,
etc.) is not always clear, and even when it is, the only choice
available to the user may be not to use the application.</p>

<p>
Some special features of Internet privacy (social media and big data)
are discussed in the following sections.</p>

<h3><a id="SocMed">2.3 Social media</a></h3>

<p>
Social media pose additional challenges. The question is not merely
about the moral reasons for limiting access to information, it is also
about the moral reasons for limiting the <em>invitations</em> to users
to submit all kinds of personal information. Social network sites
invite the user to generate more data, to increase the value of the
site (&ldquo;your profile is &hellip;% complete&rdquo;). Users are
<em>tempted</em> to exchange their personal data for the benefits of
using services, and provide both this data and their attention as
payment for the services. In addition, users may not even be aware of
what information they are tempted to provide, as in the aforementioned
case of the &ldquo;like&rdquo;-button on other sites. Merely limiting
the access to personal information does not do justice to the issues
here, and the more fundamental question lies in steering the users&rsquo;
behaviour of sharing. When the service is free, the data is needed as a form of payment.</p>

<p>
One way of limiting the temptation of users to share is requiring
default privacy settings to be strict. Even then, this limits access
for other users (&ldquo;friends of friends&rdquo;), but it does not
limit access for the service provider. Also, such restrictions limit
the value and usability of the social network sites themselves, and
may reduce positive effects of such services. A particular example of
privacy-friendly defaults is the opt-in as opposed to the opt-out
approach. When the user has to take an explicit action to share data
or to subscribe to a service or mailing list, the resulting effects
may be more acceptable to the user. However, much still depends on how
the choice is framed (Bellman, Johnson, &amp; Lohse 2001).</p>

<h3><a id="BigDat">2.4 Big data</a></h3>

<p>
Users generate loads of data when online. This is not only data
explicitly entered by the user, but also numerous statistics on user
behavior: sites visited, links clicked, search terms entered, etc. Data
mining can be employed to extract patterns from such data, which can
then be used to make decisions about the user. These may only affect
the online experience (advertisements shown), but, depending on which
parties have access to the information, they may also impact the user
in completely different contexts.</p>

<p>
In particular, big data may be used in profiling the user (Hildebrandt
2008), creating patterns of typical combinations of user properties,
which can then be used to predict interests and behavior. An innocent
application is &ldquo;you may also like &hellip;&rdquo;, but,
depending on the available data, more sensitive derivations may be
made, such as most probable religion or sexual preference. These
derivations could then in turn lead to inequal treatment or
discrimination.  When a user can be assigned to a particular group,
even only probabilistically, this may influence the actions taken by
others (Taylor, Floridi, &amp; Van der Sloot 2017). For example,
profiling could lead to refusal of insurance or a credit card, in
which case profit is the main reason for discrimination. When such
decisions are based on profiling, it may be difficult to challenge
them or even find out the explanations behind them. Profiling could
also be used by organizations or possible future governments that have
discrimination of particular groups on their political agenda, in
order to find their targets and deny them access to services, or
worse.</p>

<p>
Big data does not only emerge from Internet transactions. Similarly,
data may be collected when shopping, when being recorded by
surveillance cameras in public or private spaces, or when using
smartcard-based public transport payment systems. All these data could
be used to profile citizens, and base decisions upon such profiles.
For example, shopping data could be used to send information about
healthy food habits to particular individuals, but again also for
decisions on insurance. According to EU data protection law,
permission is needed for processing personal data, and they can only
be processed for the purpose for which they were obtained. Specific
challenges, therefore, are (a) how to obtain permission when the user
does not explicitly engage in a transaction (as in case of
surveillance), and (b) how to prevent &ldquo;function creep&rdquo;,
i.e. data being used for different purposes after they are collected
(as may happen for example with DNA databases (Dahl &amp; S&aelig;tnan
2009).</p>

<p>
One particular concern could emerge from genetics and genomic data
(Tavani 2004, Bruynseels &amp; van den Hoven, 2015). Like other data, genomics can be used to make predictions, and in particular could predict risks of diseases.
Apart from others having access to detailed user profiles, a
fundamental question here is whether the individual should know what
is known about her. In general, users could be said to have a right to
access any information stored about them, but in this case, there may
also be a right not to know, in particular when knowledge of the data
(e.g. risks of diseases) would reduce the well-being &ndash; by causing
fear, for instance &ndash; without enabling treatment. With respect to
previous examples, one may not want to know the patterns in one&rsquo;s own
shopping behavior either.</p>

<h3><a id="MobDev">2.5 Mobile devices</a></h3>

<p>
As users increasingly own networked devices such as smart phones,
mobile devices collect and send more and more data. These devices
typically contain a range of data-generating sensors, including GPS
(location), movement sensors, and cameras, and may transmit the
resulting data via the Internet or other networks. One particular
example concerns location data. Many mobile devices have a GPS sensor
that registers the user&rsquo;s location, but even without a GPS sensor,
approximate locations can be derived, for example by monitoring the
available wireless networks. As location data links the online world
to the user&rsquo;s physical environment, with the potential of physical
harm (stalking, burglary during holidays, etc.), such data are often
considered particularly sensitive.</p>

<p>
Many of these devices also contain cameras which, when applications
have access, can be used to take pictures. These can be considered
sensors as well, and the data they generate may be particularly
private. For sensors like cameras, it is assumed that the user is
aware when they are activated, and privacy depends on such knowledge.
For webcams, a light typically indicates whether the camera is on, but
this light may be manipulated by malicious software. In general,
&ldquo;reconfigurable technology&rdquo; (Dechesne, Warnier, &amp; van
den Hoven 2011) that handles personal data raises the question of user
knowledge of the configuration.</p>

<h3><a id="IntThi">2.6 The Internet of Things</a></h3>

<p>
Devices connected to the Internet are not limited to user-owned
computing devices like smartphones. Many devices contain chips and/or
are connected in the so-called Internet of Things. RFID (radio
frequency identification) chips can be read from a limited distance,
such that you can hold them in front of a reader rather than inserting
them. EU and US passports have RFID chips with protected biometric
data, but information like the user&rsquo;s nationality may easily leak when
attempting to read such devices (see Richter, Mostowski &amp; Poll
2008, in Other Internet Resources). &ldquo;Smart&rdquo; RFIDs are also
embedded in public transport payment systems. &ldquo;Dumb&rdquo;
RFIDs, basically only containing a number, appear in many kinds of
products as a replacement of the barcode, and for use in logistics.
Still, such chips could be used to trace a person once it is known
that he carries an item containing a chip.</p>

<p>
In the home, there are smart meters for automatically reading and
sending electricity and water consumption, and thermostats and other devices
that can be remotely controlled by the owner. Such devices again
generate statistics, and these can be used for mining and profiling.
In the future, more and more household appliances will be connected,
each generating its own information. Ambient intelligence (Brey 2005),
and ubiquitous computing, along with the Internet of Things
(Friedewald &amp; Raabe 2011), also enable automatic adaptation of the
environment to the user, based on explicit preferences and implicit
observations, and user autonomy is a central theme in considering the
privacy implications of such devices. In general, the move towards a
service-oriented provisioning of goods, with suppliers being informed
about how the products are used through IT and associated
connectivity, requires consideration of the associated privacy and
transparency concerns (Pieters 2013). For example, users will need to
be informed when connected devices contain a microphone and how and
when it is used.</p>

<h3><a id="EGov">2.7 E-Government</a></h3>

<p>
Government and public administration have undergone radical
transformations as a result of the availability of advanced IT systems
as well. Examples of these changes are biometric passports, online
e-government services, voting systems, a variety of online citizen
participation tools and platforms or online access to recordings of
sessions of parliament and government committee meetings. </p>

<p>
Consider the case of voting in elections. Information technology may
play a role in different phases in the voting process, which may have
different impact on voter privacy. Most countries have a requirement
that elections are to be held by secret ballot, to prevent vote buying
and coercion. In this case, the voter is supposed to keep her vote
private, <em>even if she would want to reveal it</em>. For information
technology used for casting votes, this is defined as the requirement
of receipt-freeness or coercion-resistance (Delaune, Kremer &amp; Ryan
2006). In polling stations, the authorities see to it that the voter
keeps the vote private, but such surveillance is not possible when
voting by mail or online, and it cannot even be enforced by
technological means, as someone can always watch while the voter
votes. In this case, privacy is not only a right but also a duty, and
information technology developments play an important role in the
possibilities of the voter to fulfill this duty, as well as the
possibilities of the authorities to verify this. In a broader sense,
e-democracy initiatives may change the way privacy is viewed in the
political process.</p>

<p>
More generally, privacy is important in democracy to prevent undue
influence. While lack of privacy in the voting process could enable
vote buying and coercion, there are more subtle ways of influencing
the democratic process, for example through targeted (mis)information
campaigns. Online (political) activities of citizens on for example
social media facilitate such attempts because of the possibility of
targeting through behavioural profiling. Compared to offline political
activities, it is more difficult to hide preferences and activities,
breaches of confidentiality are more likely, and attempts to influence
opinions become more scalable.</p>

<h3><a id="Surveillance">2.8 Surveillance</a></h3>

<p>
Information technology is used for all kinds of surveillance tasks. It
can be used to augment and extend traditional surveillance systems
such as CCTV and other camera systems, for example to identify
specific individuals in crowds, using face recognition techniques, or
to monitor specific places for unwanted behaviour. Such approaches
become even more powerful when combined with other techniques, such as
monitoring of Internet-of-Things devices (Motlagh et al. 2017).</p>

<p>
Besides augmenting existing surveillance systems, ICT techniques are
nowadays mainly used in the digital domain, typically grouped together
under the term &ldquo;surveillance capitalism&rdquo; (Zuboff 2019). Social
media and other online systems are used to gather large amounts of
data about individuals &ndash; either &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo;, because users
subscribe to a specific service (Google, Facebook), or involuntary by
gathering all kinds of user related data in a less transparent manner.
Data analysis and machine learning techniques are then used to
generate prediction models of individual users that can be used, for
example, for targeted advertisement, but also for more malicious
intents such as fraud or micro-targeting to influence elections
(Albright 2016, Other Internet Resources) or referenda such as Brexit
(Cadwalladr 2019, Other Internet Resources).</p>

<p>
In addition to the private sector surveillance industry, governments
form another traditional group that uses surveillance techniques at a
large scale, either by intelligence services or law enforcement. These
types of surveillance systems are typically justified with an appeal
to the &ldquo;greater good&rdquo; and protecting citizens, but their
use is also controversial. For such systems, one would typically like
to ensure that any negative effects on privacy are proportional to the
benefits achieved by the technology. Especially since these systems
are typically shrouded in secrecy, it is difficult for outsiders to
see if such systems are used proportionally, or indeed useful for
their tasks (Lawner 2002). This is particularly pressing when
governments use private sector data or services for surveillance
purposes. </p>

<p>The almost universal use of good encryption techniques
in communication systems makes it also harder to gather effective
surveillance information, leading to more and more calls for &ldquo;back
doors&rdquo; that can exclusively be used by government in communication
systems. From a privacy standpoint this could be evaluated as
unwanted, not only because it gives governments access to private
conversations, but also because it lowers the overall security of
communication systems that employ this technique (Abelson et al.
2015).</p>

<h2><a id="HowInfTecItsSolPriCon">3. How can information technology itself solve privacy concerns?</a></h2>

<p>
Whereas information technology is typically seen as the <em>cause</em>
of privacy problems, there are also several ways in which information
technology can help to solve these problems. There are rules,
guidelines or best practices that can be used for designing
privacy-preserving systems. Such possibilities range from
ethically-informed design methodologies to using encryption to protect
personal information from unauthorized use. In particular, methods
from the field of information security, aimed at protecting
information against unauthorized access, can play a key role in the
protection of personal data.</p>

<h3><a id="DesMet">3.1 Design methods</a></h3>

<p>
Value sensitive design provides a &ldquo;theoretically grounded
approach to the design of technology that accounts for human values in
a principled and comprehensive manner throughout the design
process&rdquo; (Friedman et al. 2006). It provides a set of rules and
guidelines for designing a system with a certain value in mind. One
such value can be &lsquo;privacy&rsquo;, and value sensitive design
can thus be used as a method to design privacy-friendly IT systems
(Van den Hoven et al. 2015).  The &lsquo;privacy by design&rsquo;
approach as advocated by Cavoukian (2009) and others can be regarded
as one of the value sensitive design approaches that specifically
focuses on privacy (Warnier et al. 2015). More recently, approaches
such as &ldquo;privacy engineering&rdquo; (Ceross &amp; Simpson 2018)
extend the privacy by design approach by aiming to provide a more
practical, deployable set of methods by which to achieve system-wide
privacy.</p>

<p>
The privacy by design approach provides high-level guidelines in the
form of principles for designing privacy-preserving systems.
These principles have at their core that &ldquo;data protection needs
to be viewed in proactive rather than reactive terms, making privacy
by design preventive and not simply remedial&rdquo; (Cavoukian 2010).
Privacy by design&rsquo;s main point is that data protection should be
central in all phases of product life cycles, from initial design to
operational use and disposal (see Colesky et al. 2016) for a critical
analysis of the privacy by design approach). The Privacy Impact
Assessment approach proposed by Clarke (2009) makes a similar point.
It proposes &ldquo;a systematic process for evaluating the potential
effects on privacy of a project, initiative or proposed system or
scheme&rdquo; (Clarke 2009). Note that these approaches should not
only be seen as auditing approaches, but rather as a means to make
privacy awareness and compliance an integral part of the
organizational and engineering culture.</p>

<p>
There are also several industry guidelines that can be used to design
privacy preserving IT systems. The Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard (see PCI DSS v3.2, 2018, in the Other Internet Resources),
for example, gives very clear guidelines for privacy and security
sensitive systems design in the domain of the credit card industry and
its partners (retailers, banks). Various International Organization
for Standardization (ISO) standards (Hone &amp; Eloff 2002) also serve
as a source of best practices and guidelines, especially with respect
to information security, for the design of privacy friendly systems.
Furthermore, the principles that are formed by the EU Data Protection
Directive, which are themselves based on the Fair Information
Practices (Gellman 2014) from the early 70s &ndash; transparency,
purpose, proportionality, access, transfer &ndash; are technologically
neutral and as such can also be considered as high level &lsquo;design
principles&rsquo;. Systems that are designed with these rules and
guidelines in mind should thus &ndash; in principle &ndash; be in
compliance with EU privacy laws and respect the privacy of its
users.</p>

<p>
The rules and principles described above give high-level guidance for
designing privacy-preserving systems, but this does not mean that if
these methodologies are followed the resulting IT system will
(automatically) be privacy friendly. Some design principles are rather
vague and abstract. What does it mean to make a transparent design or
to design for proportionality? The principles need to be interpreted
and placed in a context when designing a specific system. But
different people will interpret the principles differently, which will
lead to different design choices, with different effects on privacy.
There is also a difference between the design and the implementation
of a computer system. During the implementation phase software bugs
are introduced, some of which can be exploited to break the system and
extract private information. How to implement bug-free computer
systems remains an open research question (Hoare 2003). In addition,
implementation is another phase wherein choices and interpretations
are made: system designs can be implemented in infinitely many ways.
Moreover, it is very hard to verify &ndash; for anything beyond
non-trivial systems &ndash; whether an implementation meets its
design/specification (Loeckx, Sieber, &amp; Stansifer 1985). This is
even more difficult for non-functional requirements such as
&lsquo;being privacy preserving&rsquo; or security properties in
general. </p>

<p>
Some specific solutions to privacy problems aim at increasing the
level of awareness and consent of the user. These solutions can be
seen as an attempt to apply the notion of informed consent to privacy
issues with technology (Custers et al. 2018). This is connected to the
idea that privacy settings and policies should be explainable to users
(Pieters 2011). For example, the Privacy Coach supports customers in
making privacy decisions when confronted with RFID tags (Broenink et
al. 2010). However, users have only a limited capability of dealing
with such choices, and providing too many choices may easily lead to
the problem of moral overload (van den Hoven, Lokhorst, &amp; Van de
Poel 2012). A technical solution is support for automatic matching of
a privacy policy set by the user against policies issued by web sites
or apps.</p>

<h3><a id="PriEnhTec">3.2 Privacy enhancing technologies</a></h3>

<p>
A growing number of software tools are available that provide some
form of privacy (usually anonymity) for their users, such tools are
commonly known as privacy enhancing technologies (Danezis &amp;
G&uuml;rses 2010, Other Internet Resources). Examples include
communication-anonymizing tools such as Tor (Dingledine, Mathewson,
&amp; Syverson 2004) and Freenet (Clarke et al. 2001), and
identity-management systems for which many commercial software
packages exist (see below). Communication anonymizing tools allow
users to anonymously browse the web (with Tor) or anonymously share
content (Freenet). They employ a number of cryptographic techniques
and security protocols in order to ensure their goal of anonymous
communication. Both systems use the property that numerous users use
the system at the same time which provides <i>k</i>-anonymity (Sweeney
2002): no individual can be uniquely distinguished from a group of
size <i>k</i>, for large values for <i>k</i>. Depending on the system,
the value of <i>k</i> can vary between a few hundred to hundreds of
thousands. In Tor, messages are encrypted and routed along numerous
different computers, thereby obscuring the original sender of the
message (and thus providing anonymity). Similarly, in Freenet content
is stored in encrypted form from all users of the system. Since users
themselves do not have the necessary decryption keys, they do not know
what kind of content is stored, by the system, on their own computer.
This provides plausible deniability and privacy. The system can at any
time retrieve the encrypted content and send it to different Freenet
users.</p>

<p>
Privacy enhancing technologies also have their downsides. For example,
Tor, the tool that allows anonymized communication and browsing over
the Internet, is susceptible to an attack whereby, under certain
circumstances, the anonymity of the user is no longer guaranteed
(Back, M&ouml;ller, &amp; Stiglic 2001; Evans, Dingledine, &amp;
Grothoff 2009). Freenet (and other tools) have similar problems
(Douceur 2002). Note that for such attacks to work, an attacker needs
to have access to large resources that in practice are only realistic
for intelligence agencies of countries. However, there are other
risks. Configuring such software tools correctly is difficult for the
average user, and when the tools are not correctly configured
anonymity of the user is no longer guaranteed. And there is always the
risk that the computer on which the privacy-preserving software runs
is infected by a Trojan horse (or other digital pest) that monitors
all communication and knows the identity of the user.</p>

<p>
Another option for providing anonymity is the anonymization of data
through special software. Tools exist that remove patient names and
reduce age information to intervals: the age 35 is then represented as
falling in the range 30&ndash;40. The idea behind such anonymization
software is that a record can no longer be linked to an individual,
while the relevant parts of the data can still be used for scientific
or other purposes. The problem here is that it is very hard to
anonymize data in such a way that all links with an individual are
removed and the resulting anonymized data is still useful for research
purposes. Researchers have shown that it is almost always possible to
reconstruct links with individuals by using sophisticated statistical
methods (Danezis, Diaz, &amp; Troncoso 2007) and by combining multiple
databases (Anderson 2008) that contain personal information.
Techniques such as <i>k</i>-anonymity might also help to generalize
the data enough to make it unfeasible to de-anonymize data (LeFevre et
al. 2005).</p>

<h3><a id="Cry">3.3 Cryptography</a></h3>

<p>
Cryptography has long been used as a means to protect data, dating
back to the Caesar cipher more than two thousand years ago. Modern
cryptographic techniques are essential in any IT system that needs to
store (and thus protect) personal data, for example by providing
secure (confidential) connections for browsing (HTTPS) and networking
(VPN). Note however that by itself cryptography does not provide any
protection against data breaching; only when applied correctly in a
specific context does it become a &lsquo;fence&rsquo; around personal
data. In addition, cryptographic schemes that become outdated by
faster computers or new attacks may pose threats to (long-term)
privacy.</p>

<p>Cryptography is a large
field, so any description here will be incomplete. The focus will be
instead on some newer cryptographic techniques, in particular
homomorphic encryption, that have the potential to become very
important for processing and searching in personal data.</p>

<p>
Various techniques exist for searching through encrypted data (Song et
al. 2000, Wang et al. 2016), which provides a form of privacy
protection (the data is encrypted) and selective access to sensitive
data. One relatively new technique that can be used for designing
privacy-preserving systems is &lsquo;homomorphic encryption&rsquo;
(Gentry 2009, Acar et al. 2018). Homomorphic encryption allows a data
processor to process encrypted data, i.e. users could send personal
data in encrypted form and get back some useful results &ndash; for
example, recommendations of movies that online friends like &ndash; in
encrypted form. The original user can then again decrypt the result
and use it without revealing any personal data to the data processor.
Homomorphic encryption, for example, could be used to aggregate
encrypted data thereby allowing both privacy protection and useful
(anonymized) aggregate information. The technique is currently not
widely applied; there are serious performance issues if one wants to
apply full homomorphic encryption to the large amounts of data stored
in today&rsquo;s systems. However, variants of the original homomorphic
encryption scheme are emerging, such as Somewhat Homomorphic
Encryption (Badawi et al. 2018), that are showing promise to be more
widely applied in practice.</p>

<p>
The main idea behind blockchain technology was first described in the
seminal paper on Bitcoins (Nakamoto, n.d., Other Internet Resources).
A blockchain is basically a distributed ledger that stores
transactions in a non-reputable way, without the use of a trusted
third party. Cryptography is used to ensure that all transactions are
&ldquo;approved&rdquo; by members of the blockchain and stored in such a way
that they are linked to previous transactions and cannot be removed.
Although focused on data integrity and not inherently anonymous,
blockchain technology enables many privacy-related applications
(Yli-Huumo et al. 2016, Karame and Capkun 2018), such as anonymous
cryptocurrency (Narayanan et al. 2016) and self-sovereign identity
(see below).</p>

<h3><a id="IdeMan">3.4 Identity management</a></h3>

<p>
The use and management of user&rsquo;s online identifiers are crucial in the
current Internet and social networks. Online reputations become more
and more important, both for users and for companies. In the era of
big data correct information about users has an
increasing monetary value.</p>

<p>
&lsquo;Single sign on&rsquo; frameworks, provided by independent third
parties (OpenID) but also by large companies such as Facebook,
Microsoft and Google (Ko et al. 2010), make it easy for users to
connect to numerous online services using a single online identity.
These online identities are usually directly linked to the real world
(off line) identities of individuals; indeed Facebook, Google and
others require this form of log on (den Haak 2012). Requiring a direct
link between online and &lsquo;real world&rsquo; identities is
problematic from a privacy perspective, because they allow profiling
of users (Benevenuto et al. 2012). Not all users will realize how
large the amount of data is that companies gather in this manner, or
how easy it is to build a detailed profile of users. Profiling becomes
even easier if the profile information is combined with other
techniques such as implicit authentication via cookies and tracking
cookies (Mayer &amp; Mitchell 2012).</p>

<p>
From a privacy perspective a better solution would be the use of
attribute-based authentication (Goyal et al. 2006) which allows access
of online services based on the attributes of users, for example their
friends, nationality, age etc. Depending on the attributes used, they
might still be traced back to specific individuals, but this is no
longer crucial. In addition, users can no longer be tracked to
different services because they can use different attributes to access
different services which makes it difficult to trace online identities
over multiple transactions, thus providing unlinkability for the user.
Recently (Allen 2016, Other Internet Resources), the concept of
self-sovereign identity has emerged, which aims for users to have
complete ownership and control about their own digital identities.
Blockchain technology is used to make it possible for users to control
a digital identity without the use of a traditional trusted third
party (Baars 2016).</p>

<h2><a id="EmeTecOurUndPri">4. Emerging technologies and our understanding of privacy</a></h2>

<p>
In the previous sections, we have outlined how current technologies
may impact privacy, as well as how they may contribute to mitigating
undesirable effects. However, there are future and emerging
technologies that may have an even more profound impact. Consider for
example brain-computer interfaces. In case computers are connected
directly to the brain, not only behavioral characteristics are subject
to privacy considerations, but even one&rsquo;s thoughts run the risk of
becoming public, with decisions of others being based upon them. In
addition, it could become possible to change one&rsquo;s behavior by means
of such technology. Such developments therefore require further
consideration of the reasons for protecting privacy. In particular,
when brain processes could be influenced from the outside, autonomy
would be a value to reconsider to ensure adequate protection.</p>

<p>
Apart from evaluating information technology against current moral
norms, one also needs to consider the possibility that technological
changes influence the norms themselves (Boenink, Swierstra &amp;
Stemerding 2010). Technology thus does not only influence privacy by
changing the accessibility of information, but also by changing the
privacy norms themselves. For example, social networking sites invite
users to share more information than they otherwise might. This
&ldquo;oversharing&rdquo; becomes accepted practice within certain
groups. With future and emerging technologies, such influences can
also be expected and therefore they ought to be taken into account
when trying to mitigate effects.</p>

<p>
Another fundamental question is whether, given the future (and even
current) level of informational connectivity, it is feasible to
protect privacy by trying to hide information from parties who may use
it in undesirable ways. Gutwirth &amp; De Hert (2008) argue that it
may be more feasible to protect privacy by transparency &ndash; by
requiring actors to justify decisions made about individuals, thus
insisting that decisions are not based on illegitimate information.
This approach comes with its own problems, as it might be hard to
prove that the wrong information was used for a decision. Still, it
may well happen that citizens, in turn, start data collection on those
who collect data about them, e.g. governments. Such
&ldquo;counter(sur)veillance&rdquo; may be used to gather information
about the use of information, thereby improving accountability
(G&uuml;rses et al. 2016). The open source movement may also
contribute to transparency of data processing. In this context,
transparency can be seen as a pro-ethical condition contributing to
privacy (Turilli &amp; Floridi 2009).</p>

<p>
It has been argued that the precautionary principle, well known in
environmental ethics, might have a role in dealing with emerging
information technologies as well (Pieters &amp; van Cleeff 2009; Som,
Hilty &amp; K&ouml;hler 2009). The principle would see to it that the
burden of proof for absence of irreversible effects of information
technology on society, e.g. in terms of power relations and equality,
would lie with those advocating the new technology. Precaution, in
this sense, could then be used to impose restrictions at a regulatory
level, in combination with or as an alternative to empowering users,
thereby potentially contributing to the prevention of informational
overload on the user side. Apart from general debates about the
desirable and undesirable features of the precautionary principle,
challenges to it lie in its translation to social effects and social
sustainability, as well as to its application to consequences induced
by intentional actions of agents. Whereas the occurrence of natural
threats or accidents is probabilistic in nature, those who are
interested in improper use of information behave strategically,
requiring a different approach to risk (i.e. security as opposed to
safety). In addition, proponents of precaution will need to balance it
with other important principles, viz., of informed consent and
autonomy.</p>

<p>
Finally, it is appropriate to note that not all social effects of
information technology concern privacy (Pieters 2017). Examples
include the effects of social network sites on friendship, and the
verifiability of results of electronic elections. Therefore,
value-sensitive design approaches and impact assessments of
information technology should not focus on privacy only, since
information technology affects many other values as well.</p>

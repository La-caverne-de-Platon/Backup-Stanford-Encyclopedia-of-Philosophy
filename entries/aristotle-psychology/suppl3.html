<h2>Controversies Surrounding Aristotle's Theory of Perception</h2>

<p>

The most immediate difficulty for Aristotle&rsquo;s approach to perception
concerns his claim that in sense perception the relevant sensory
faculty becomes like the object it perceives. (This claim is reflected
in clause (iii) of the general analysis of Aristotelian perception
offered in the main article.) When he says that &ldquo;what can
perceive is potentially such as the object of sense is actually&rdquo;
(<em>De Anima</em> ii 5, 418a3&ndash;4), Aristotle seems to commit himself to
a claim to the effect that a sense organ in one way or another becomes
<em>like</em> its object when it perceives. The difficulty concerns
understanding precisely how this likeness is supposed to be envisaged.
In the abstract, it is easy to understand this claim in a variety of
different ways. An ultimate evaluation of Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of
perception will need first to decide what he intends.</p>

<p>

At one end of the spectrum, some commentators have understood
Aristotle to intend something utterly plain and literal. What it takes
for a person to perceive is for him to be outfitted with the
appropriate organs and to have those organs actualized on specific
occasions by ambient perceptual qualities. Appropriate organs are those
with, among other things, an ability to share <em>by coming to
exemplify</em> the sensible qualities which they are structured to
receive. So, for example, on this approach a subject perceives redness
when he has an eye made of suitably gelatinous stuff such that when it
is exposed to a color in its environment it becomes, in virtue of this
exposure, itself red. That is, on the literalist interpretation, the
sense organs become literally, and non-representationally, the colors
they perceive. More exactly, according to proponents of this approach,
the eye jelly, the matter of the inner eye, itself becomes red. So,
<em>likeness</em> amounts to shared-property exemplification. Just as a
grey fence becomes like a white fence when white paint is applied to
it, precisely because it is made to exemplify whiteness, so an eye
becomes like its object in perception when it is made to be like it,
which occurs when it is made to exemplify the quality of its object.
The eye, for instance, simply comes to exemplify the colors present in
the objects its field.</p>

<p>

Commentators who favor this approach, including most notably Sorabji
(1974), with whom the interpretation originated in contemporary times
and who has been its most adept proponent, have been able to amass
textual evidence suggesting that Aristotle believes that some such
literal alteration occurs in perception. Detractors have not found this
commitment in the passages adduced and have in turn pointed to passages
with, evidently, just the opposite purport. So, one exegetical question
concerns whether Aristotle clearly expresses the view that each of the
sense organs actually exemplifies the sensible qualities experienced in
sense perception (the eyes taking on colors, the ears pinging sounds,
the nose piquant odors, and so forth). One further philosophical
question left largely unaddressed by this literature concerns whether
Aristotle can be supposed to believe that literal alteration of the
sort described is <em>sufficient</em> for perception. That seems an odd
and unsustainable claim, since, for example, my flesh can become warm
without my perceiving warmth; indeed, the view thus interpreted seems
to entail that I perceive every sensible quality in whose presence I
find myself, with no allowance for the phenomena of selective
attention, inattention, distraction, and the like. This is because in
its purest form this interpretation seems to make perception an almost
completely passive affair, something which occurs automatically whenever
the ingredients of perception share a discrete locale. If, on the other
hand, literal likeness is to be understood as only a <em>necessary</em>
condition for form assimilation, then the original question about
likeness re-emerges. What does it take for a sense organ to become like
its object so as to suffice for perception? It cannot be the mere
shared exemplification of some property. What then is required for
perception in addition to becoming literally like?</p>

<p>

Partly in view of these sorts of questions, and partly because they
have not been persuaded by the textual evidence offered on behalf of
the literalist interpretation, other commentators have pursued
non-literalist alternatives. Indeed, non-literalist interpretations
extend at least as far back as Brentano (1867), who had been inspired
by the still earlier approach of Aquinas. Among the Greek commentators
of late antiquity, Philoponus had already cast doubt on literalist
interpretations (<em>in</em> <em>DA</em> 303.3). On one alternative
approach, which may be called the <em>intentionalist</em>
interpretation, the sense organs become like their objects without
actually coming to exemplify the sensible qualities perceived. Instead,
they become like them by coming to <em>symbolize</em> them in one way
or another. In its simplest form, this approach regards the likeness
involved in perception as akin to the likeness obtaining between a
house and its blue print. If an architect has three blue prints on her
desk, one of a house, one of a church, and one of a factory, then
exactly one of them has the same structure as the house built according
to its specifications. She may say with all linguistic propriety, when
pointing to one set of the blueprints, &lsquo;This one is a
house.&rsquo; That set of blue prints &lsquo;is a house&rsquo; not
because it exemplifies the property of being a house, but because it
somehow <em>encodes</em> that property. So, to begin, two things can be
like each other with respect to the same property without their both
exemplifying that property. As applied to Aristotle&rsquo;s theory of
perception, then, a sensory organ can be made like its object, can
receive its sensible property, without actually exemplifying that
property. If this qualifies as a form of likeness for Aristotle, and it
does seems to qualify as such since he is willing, for example, to
speak of &ldquo;the form in the craftsman&rsquo;s soul&rdquo; as a way of
someone&rsquo;s having a form which is then imparted to some matter made to
exemplify it, then there is a reasonably clear way for Aristotle to
articulate a doctrine of form reception which does not commit itself to
literal property transference (cf. <em>Metaphysics</em> vii 7,1032a32,
b5, b22).</p>

<p>

There seem some obvious advantages to this approach, but also some
difficulties. Among its advantages are that it does not saddle
Aristotle with the dubious empirical claim that all organs, in all
instances of perception, always come to exemplify the sensible
qualities they perceive. (Do my eyes really become pinstriped when I
see a dapper man&rsquo;s suit?) Second, this approach seems more obviously
compatible with the phenomena of selective attention and the like. For
on this view, a perceiver will not be made to encode just any sensible
quality in whose presence she finds herself. Instead, she may be made
like -- intentionally like -- only some subset of the properties in
her immediate environment. Still, there are some costs. To begin,
Aristotle does not expressly distinguish between the literal and
intentional interpretations, and so does not argue determinately in
favor of one over the other. Moreover, even granting the
intentionalist approach, some of the same questions which arose
regarding the literalist approach emerge again, in a new guise. If
form reception and isomorphism are to be understood intentionally,
then is form-reception thus construed sufficient for perception? If
so, why is it that other entities which encode sensible properties do
not perceive? If, however, form-reception thus construed is not
sufficient for perception, then what more is necessary?</p>

<h2>Schleiermacher and the Historiography of Philosophy</h2>

<p>
After eighteenth-century historians of philosophy such as Brucker and
Tiedemann had written the history of philosophy in interpretively
questionable, Whiggish terms as a march of progress toward the
supposedly true Leibnizian-Wolffian philosophy, and in a context in
which both Kant and Hegel themselves and their followers were busy
writing the history of philosophy in interpretively questionable,
Whiggish terms as a march of progress toward their own supposedly true
philosophical positions, Schleiermacher entered the scene as an
important and influential champion of interpretive scrupulousness in
the historiography of philosophy.</p>

<p>
His hermeneutics developed a demanding general methodology for
interpretation that proved very influential and beneficial for work on
the history of philosophy in particular. As we have seen, that
methodology was largely motivated by the problem of the intellectual
distance that usually separates an interpreter from the interpretee,
and the natural tendency to misunderstanding that this creates. In
response, Schleiermacher recommends that the interpreter take a broad
range of careful measures. These include keeping the question of the
author&rsquo;s meaning sharply separate from that of its truth; paying
close attention to the author&rsquo;s historical context; identifying
the patterns of word-use in the author&rsquo;s background language, as
well as his own distinctive modifications of them (since patterns of
word-use <em>constitute</em> meanings or concepts); hypothesizing the
nature of the author&rsquo;s distinctive psychology as an aid to
understanding his text; and bringing several sorts of holism to bear
in interpretation (in particular, reading texts in the light of their
whole historical contexts, reading the parts of a text in light of the
whole text and the latter in light of the author&rsquo;s whole corpus,
and paying attention to the author&rsquo;s whole psychology as
well).</p>

<p>
These hermeneutic principles were subsequently re-articulated and
further elaborated by Schleiermacher&rsquo;s students, often in
application to work on the history of philosophy in particular. For
example, C.A. Brandis in his <em>On the Concept of History of
Philosophy</em> (1815) drew on Schleiermacher&rsquo;s hermeneutic
principles in order to develop a methodology for the historiography of
philosophy, as did H. Ritter in his <em>On the Education of the
Philosopher through History of Philosophy</em> (1817). Boeckh&rsquo;s
more general re-articulation and elaboration of Schleiermacher&rsquo;s
hermeneutics in his influential <em>Encyclopedia and Methodology of
the Philological Sciences</em> was also relevant for the
historiography of philosophy.</p>

<p>
Through the combined influence of Schleiermacher himself, Brandis,
Ritter, and Boeckh, the hermeneutic principles in question came to
exercise a very strong and beneficial impact on the study of the
history of philosophy in the nineteenth century. Not surprisingly,
given the fact that their own work focused on ancient philosophy, this
proved to be especially true in ancient philosophy. But it also proved
to be true in other areas of the historiography of philosophy. For
example, Schleiermacher&rsquo;s follower, Dilthey, applied this sort
of scrupulous interpretive method to the interpretation of modern
philosophers such as Hamann, Hegel, and Schleiermacher himself.
Moreover, most of the best work that has been done on the history of
philosophy since the nineteenth century has to one degree or another
been influenced and benefited by the
Schleiermacher-Brandis-Ritter-Boeckh methodology of interpretation.
Even to this day, it is one of the main virtues of German
historiography of philosophy that it still tends to be strongly
influenced by this methodology (despite the intervening influence of
contrary, and inferior, hermeneutic principles deriving from Heidegger
and Gadamer).</p>

<p>
Schleiermacher himself was enabled by his scrupulous hermeneutic
methodology to make several noteworthy specific contributions to the
historiography of philosophy. First, he contributed greatly to the
study of Socrates and Plato, not only by bringing to fruition his own
and Friedrich Schlegel&rsquo;s project of translating the Platonic
dialogues into German, but also by offering scholarly commentary on
them. He accomplished the latter task in the prefaces that he wrote
for the translations; in lectures on the history of philosophy that he
delivered from 1806 on, which were published posthumously by his
student Ritter in 1839; and in an influential essay on Socrates from
1815.</p>

<p>
His commentary on Socrates and Plato is an important achievement,
albeit one with significant limitations. For one thing, he developed
an illuminating and influential explanation of
Socrates&rsquo;&mdash;and by implication also
Plato&rsquo;s&mdash;importance as a philosopher. In the essay <em>On
Socrates&rsquo; Value as a Philosopher</em> (1815) he argued that
Socrates&rsquo; great merit was that he turned philosophy away from a
concern with reality, or nature, toward a concern with knowledge, and
that he introduced a method that focused on proper concept-formation
and -combination. If properly construed, this interpretation is
correct and important, at least as far as it goes. But it is not
entirely satisfactory as an explanation either of why the ancient
world found Socrates&rsquo; ideas so valuable or of why we should. It
is only likely to seem so if one happens to be a Kantian and as a
result construes it anachronistically, and is impressed by it, as a
sort of description of Kantianism <em>avant la lettre</em>.</p>

<p>
In the dialectics lectures Schleiermacher also implies a somewhat
different case for Plato&rsquo;s importance&mdash;a case that is
heavily indebted to Friedrich Schlegel. In the lectures Schleiermacher
himself conceives knowledge in quasi-Platonic terms as something that
can only be approximated in a process of endless striving. Moreover,
in later cycles of the lectures he accords real dialogue a central
role in this process, just as Plato had done (having in earlier
cycles, by contrast, envisaged something more like Aristotelian
&ldquo;dialectic&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
Schleiermacher also made numerous more specific interpretive
suggestions concerning the Platonic dialogues that are genuinely
illuminating. For example, he pointed out that Plato&rsquo;s choice of
the dialogue form should be understood in light of his views in the
<em>Phaedrus</em> and elsewhere concerning the superiority of the
spoken over the written word.</p>

<p>
Schleiermacher also made progress in connection with the question of
the chronological order and development of the dialogues. In
particular, he performed the important service of substituting for the
traditional ancient divisions of the dialogues into groups according
to content, a new focus on their order of composition; and of
distinguishing between early, middle, and late sets of dialogues (as
we still do today). However, his conception of which dialogues
belonged to which periods, far from anticipating the broad consensus
about this that we enjoy today (so that twentieth-century scholars as
different in their approaches in other respects as Richard Robinson
and Gregory Vlastos largely agree on which dialogues belong to which
periods), looks bizarre by modern lights. For instance, he assigns the
<em>Phaedrus</em> and the <em>Parmenides</em> to the early period, the
<em>Sophist</em> to the middle, and the <em>Republic</em> to the late!
This strange ordering was largely a result of a dubious assumption he
made in the spirit of his hermeneutical conception of a &quot;seminal
decision&quot;: that Plato began writing the dialogues with a fixed
philosophical position in mind which he merely unfolded over the
course of successive dialogues rather than changing. (The credit for
developing our modern chronological ordering of the dialogues belongs
not to Schleiermacher or his followers but to a different group of
nineteenth-century German scholars of ancient
philosophy&mdash;especially, Hermann, Nitzsch, Stallbaum, Steinhart,
and Susemihl.)</p>

<p>
Second, Schleiermacher also contributed significant scholarship on
further topics in ancient philosophy, both in the form of brief
treatments in the lectures on the history of philosophy that he
delivered from 1806 on and in the form of separate monographs on
Heraclitus, Anaximander, and Diogenes of Apollonia. His scholarship on
presocratic philosophy was especially important. One of his
achievements here was a careful collation of sources, which
anticipated and helped prepare the way for the work of Hermann Diels
and Walther Kranz later in the century. Another was a recognition of
the frequent unreliability of Aristotle&rsquo;s reports on the
Presocratics (a subject that has since been explored and established
more thoroughly by Harold Cherniss and others).</p>

<p>
Schleiermacher&rsquo;s work on ancient philosophy had an enormous
influence on his successors in nineteenth-century Germany, as was
widely acknowledged at the time. The two most influential historians
of ancient philosophy in the next generation&mdash;Ritter, author of
<em>History of Philosophy</em> (1829&ndash;53), and Brandis, author of
<em>Handbook of the History of Greek-Roman Philosophy</em>
(1835&ndash;66)&mdash;were both pupils of Schleiermacher&rsquo;s.
Moreover, they generally followed him not only in their general
methodology (as already discussed), but also in their specific
interpretations and evaluations of ancient philosophers. And they paid
him warm public tribute. Similarly, the most important historian of
ancient philosophy in the generation after them, Eduard Zeller, was
strongly influenced by Schleiermacher&rsquo;s work, and wrote a warm
tribute to it in <em>The History of Ancient Philosophy in the Last
Fifty Years with Special Attention to the Most Recent Treatments of
It</em> (1843).</p>

<p>
Third, together with Schlegel and Hegel, Schleiermacher contributed to
the growth of interest in medieval philosophy. In particular, he
treated this subject at some length in his lectures on the history of
philosophy. After him, and in part thanks to his influence, interest
in medieval philosophy would develop further during the nineteenth
century, especially with Victor Cousin and his school in France.</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Nicolaus Copernicus</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>
 
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a> Swerdlow and
Neugebauer (4) used the bindings to establish Copernicus&rsquo;s acquisition
of the 1492 Venice edition of the <em>Alfonsine Tables</em> and the
1490 Augsburg edition of Regiomontanus&rsquo;s <em>Tabulae directionum</em>,
two very important books for astronomical calculation, to this
period. They were bound together with sections of other astronomical
works. A second volume contained the 1482 Venice edition of Euclid&rsquo;s
<em>Elements</em> with the commentary by Campanus and the 1485 Venice
edition of the astrological treatise <em>In iudiciis astrorum</em> by
the Arab author Ali ibn Abir-Rijal.</p></div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a> The debate on the
validity of astrology became particularly vociferous after the
publication of Pico&rsquo;s <em>Disputations against Judicial Astrology</em>
in 1494.  (See, e.g., Shumaker, chapter 1.) Given the facts that
Copernicus&rsquo;s undergraduate and medical programs most likely included astrology and Copernicus&rsquo;s main publication was in the
field of astronomy, his silence on the subject of astrology, pro or
con, is surprising.</p></div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a> There is no proof that
Copernicus took his heliocentric idea from Aristarchus, as Gingerich
(1993, 185&ndash;92) rightly argued.  Arthur Koestler (212&ndash;13) had claimed
that Copernicus&rsquo;s idea for the heliocentric model was taken from
Aristarchus, suggesting that Copernicus did not deserve credit for the
idea. Koestler&rsquo;s <em>The Sleepwalkers</em> is a popularized version of
the lives and works of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo; though
extremely readable, it is simplistic, judgmental, and
ahistorical. Yet, its points must be addressed. It is still a very
popular book and has often been a stimulus to the study of the history
of science in this period; witness Gingerich (2004, vii-viii), one of
the most respected scholars of Copernicus and Kepler. Scholars in
cultural studies often depend heavily on Koestler. For example, Hallyn
(50) used an erroneous assertion by Koestler that Copernicus approved
the anonymous preface to <em>On the Revolutions</em> to bolster his
argument about irony. Lastly, many scholars either tacitly or
vociferously have had a running debate with Koestler in their works;
witness the title of Gingerich&rsquo;s 2004 volume. Therefore, this article
will continue to call attention to points that refute Koestler.</p></div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a> &ldquo;In <em>De
revolutionibus</em> he uses the form of Tusi&rsquo;s device with inclined
axes for the inequality of the precession and the variation of the
obliquity of the ecliptic, and in both the <em>Commentariolus</em> and
<em>De revolutionibus</em> he uses it for the oscillation of the
orbital planes in the latitude theory&hellip;The planetary models for
longitude in the <em>Commentariolus</em> are all based upon the models
of Ibn ash-Shatir &ndash; although the arrangement for the inferior
planets is incorrect &ndash; while those for the superior planets in
<em>De revolutionibus</em> use the same arrangement as Urdi&rsquo;s and
Shirazi&rsquo;s model, and for the inferior planets the smaller epicycle is
converted into an equivalent rotating eccentricity that constitutes a
correct adaptation of Ibn ash-Shatir&rsquo;s model. In both the
<em>Commentariolus</em> and <em>De revolutionibus</em> the lunar model
is identical to Ibn ash-Shatir&rsquo;s and finally in both works Copernicus
makes it clear that he was addressing the same physical problems of
Ptolemy&rsquo;s models as his predecessors.&rdquo; (Swerdlow and Neugebauer,
47; see also Saliba, chapter 6). On the other hand, Bl&aring;sj&ouml;
claimed there was enough difference between Copernicus&rsquo;s planetary
models and those of the late Islamic astronomers that Copernicus could
have derived them directly from ancient models. Goddu (476&ndash;86)
also wondered why there is no proof of their transmission from East to
West. But Morrison suggested that Jewish travelers, like the scholar
Moses Galeano, created intellectual links between the Islamic world
and the Italian peninsula just about the time when Copernicus was
studying there.</p></div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
Swerdlow categorically rejected this assessment, though he agreed that
Copernicus was bothered by Ptolemy&rsquo;s violation of uniform circular
motion. He wrote, &ldquo;The common belief that Copernicus did away
with the equant, or wished to do away with the equant, is simply
false, for it was as fundamental to his planetary theory as to
Ptolemy&rsquo;s, and even in the time of Brahe and Kepler, there was no
observational distinction between the models of Ptolemy and
Copernicus. The motivation for Copernicus&rsquo;s model was entirely
physical: to preserve the uniform rotation of spheres&rdquo;
(Swerdlow, 2000, 167). Swerdlow, however, was confusing intention and
result. Whether or not Copernicus accomplished that goal of
eliminating the equant, or whether or not it made any observational
difference is immaterial because he believed that the equant
had to be eliminated, and he gave that as a motivation for his reform of
astronomy. Moreover, Copernicus believed that he had succeeded in
eliminating the equant, as did his contemporaries. It was not until the end of the sixteenth century that Maestlin discovered the hidden equant in Copernicus&rsquo;s models (see Goddu 383, n. 52). There is irony, of
course, in Copernicus&rsquo;s anxiety to eliminate Ptolemy&rsquo;s equant, for Kepler
had to reinstate it in order to derive his first two laws of planetary
motion. But this, too, should not be a reason to diminish the
importance of eliminating the equant for Copernicus.</p></div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a> 
Kuhn, 128&ndash;31, and Yates, 153&ndash;54, turned to the popularity during the
Renaissance of Neoplatonism and Hermetism respectively and their
supposed glorification of the sun as a possible reason for
Copernicus&rsquo;s adoption of the heliocentric model. But given the paucity
of Copernicus&rsquo;s references to Neoplatonism and a single incorrect
reference to Hermes Trismegistus, this assumes that Copernicus must
have been under the influence of Neoplatonism simply because it was
one of the many philosophies available to him and this seemed most
likely. Kuhn also suggested that the Ptolemaic model had developed too
many circles and had become too cumbersome, but this simply is not
true. In fact, Copernicus&rsquo;s model had more circles. On the other hand,
if Kuhn and Yates thought that he was influenced by being at
the forefront of Renaissance thought, Koestler thought that he was
too conservative, as proved by his Aristotelianism. But Koestler&rsquo;s
belief that Aristotelianism was conservative, and
therefore bad, came from his associating Aristotle with medieval
scholastic thought, which Koestler believed to be bad.  In fact,
neither Aristotelianism nor medieval scholastic thought was inherently
conservative nor progressive, neither good nor bad. They were both very
important in the history of all western thought and both contributed
much to scientific thought as well.</p></div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a> 
Koestler titled his section on Copernicus &lsquo;The Timid
Canon&rsquo; and throughout mocked him for his cowardice. But
Copernicus was rightly concerned that his observations and
mathematical proofs should be adequate to his task, and like all
scholars he needed a colleague who could evaluate them. </p></div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>  Swerdlow and
Neugebauer (58) claimed that &ldquo;[o]ne of the principal reasons
Copernicus adopted the heliocentric theory is that it gives the
distances of the planets from the mean sun unambiguously, and it gives
them without making any assumptions about nested spheres.&rdquo;
Goldstein considered this relationship between the length of the orbit
and the distance from the sun the real impetus for Copernicus&rsquo;s move
to the heliocentric system. While it is true that this is a major
advantage of that system, there is nothing to suggest that it is why
Copernicus turned to the system. Westman (2011, 100&ndash;05), based
in part on the importance of this concept, argued that Copernicus&rsquo;s
response to one of Pico&rsquo;s criticisms in the <em>Disputations</em> was
the genesis of the heliocentric system. In book 10 Pico claimed that
the inability of astrologers to establish the correct order of the
inner planets was further proof of its falsehood. Heliocentricism, in
this reading, established the order and thereby became the savior of
astrology, which was Copernicus&rsquo;s intent. Problems with this
hypothesis arise because not only did Copernicus fail to mention
astrology, but Rheticus, who did refer to it in the <em>First
Report</em>, wrote that Copernicus&rsquo;s work answered Pico&rsquo;s criticisms
in books 8 and 9. There was no mention of book 10.</p></div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a> 
Swerdlow and Neugebauer provided an excellent commentary on the
mathematics of <em>On the Revolutions</em>.</p></div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a> Swerdlow and
Neugebauer (24) listed several books from Petreius: Regiomontanus&rsquo;s
<em>De triangulis omnimodis</em> (1533), Apianus&rsquo;s <em>Instrumentum
primi mobilis</em> and Jabir ibn Aflah&rsquo;s <em>De astronomia</em>
(1534), and Vitelo&rsquo;s <em>Perspectiva</em> (1535). Other books that
Rheticus definitely brought with him were the first printing in Greek
of Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em> with commentary by Proclus on book 1
(Basel, 1533) and Ptolemy&rsquo;s <em>Almagest</em> (or <em>Syntaxis</em> in
Greek) with Theon&rsquo;s commentary (Basel, 1538).  Swerdlow and Neugebauer
conjectured that he also brought Regiomontanus&rsquo;s <em>Problemata XXIX
saphaeae instrumenti astronomici</em> (1534), Camerarius&rsquo;s first Greek
edition and partial translation of Ptolemy&rsquo;s <em>Tetrabiblos</em>
(1536), and Sch&scaron;ner&rsquo;s edition of Al-Farghani and Al-Battani with
Regiomontanus&rsquo;s &lsquo;Oration&rsquo; on the mathematical sciences
(1537).</p></div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a> 
Koestler (176) claimed that the omission of Rheticus&rsquo;s name in the
dedication &ldquo;killed the apostle in Rheticus.&rdquo; In fact,
Rheticus did not lose interest in promoting the Copernican system
after the publication of <em>On the Revolutions</em>. It would have
been preposterous for Rheticus to expect Copernicus to mention him in
a dedication to the pope, and Rheticus was with Copernicus when he
wrote the dedication. In fact, given the religious tensions in Europe
at the time, the bond between the Catholic canon and the Protestant
minister is notable &ndash; and heartening.</p></div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a> Westman (2011,31)
noted that Copernicus used the term <em>mathematici</em>, which is
translated here as &lsquo;astronomers&rsquo;. This word was often used
as a synonym for astrologer, and Westman suggested that this showed
that Copernicus identified with astrologers.</p></div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a> 
Koestler&rsquo;s claim (217) that &ldquo;the Copernican theory was
practically ignored until the opening of the seventeenth
century&rdquo; is simply untrue. For the most effective &ndash; and
affecting &ndash; rebuttal, see Gingerich 2004.</p></div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a> 
As Rosen (1984, 182&ndash;83) noted, there are differing accounts of what
Luther said.</p></div>

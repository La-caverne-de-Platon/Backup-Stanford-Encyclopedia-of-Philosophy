<h2>Counterpart-theoretic Semantics for Quantified Modal Logic</h2>

<h3>Lewis&rsquo;s original proposal</h3>

<p>
Lewis (1968) proposes a translation from the language of quantified
modal logic into an extensional first-order language with quantifiers
ranging over possible worlds and possible individuals. Like the
&ldquo;standard translation&rdquo; for Kripke semantics (van Benthem
1983), Lewis&rsquo;s translation implicitly defines a semantics for
quantified modal logic.</p>

<p>
The eight postulates of Lewis (1968) can be seen as defining a
concept of a model. As usual, a model contains some worlds and some individuals. Every world is associated with a domain of
individuals which are &ldquo;in&rdquo; the world. According to
Lewis&rsquo;s second postulate, no individual is &ldquo;in&rdquo; more
than one world; so different worlds have disjoint domains. Like in
Kripke semantics, the worlds may be related by an accessibility
relation. In addition, individuals may be related by a counterpart
relation. Lewis&rsquo;s sixth postulate says that this relation is
reflexive. According to his fifth postulate, nothing is a counterpart
of anything else in its world. (This assumption is dropped in Lewis
1986e, 232.) Lewis also identifies a designated &ldquo;actual&rdquo;
world, relative to which non-modal sentences are interpreted.</p>

<p>
In the semantics induced by Lewis's translation rules, formulas of quantified modal logic are true
relative to a world and an assignment function. The interpretation of
atomic sentences and boolean connectives is standard, except that
disjointness of domains allows interpreting predicates in terms of
sets of tuples of individuals, with no world-relativity. Quantifiers
are given an &ldquo;actualist&rdquo; interpretation, so they range
only over individuals in the relevant world. The key novelty is the
interpretation of the modal operators:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Box \phi\) is true relative to a world \(w\) and assignment \(g\) iff \(\phi\)
is true relative to every world \(w^\prime\) accessible from \(w\) and every
assignment \(g^\prime\) such that \(g^\prime(x)\) is a counterpart of \(g(x)\) for
each variable \(x\) that is free in \(\phi\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
\(\Diamond \phi\) is the dual of \(\Box \phi\).</p>

<p>
A few preliminary comments:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>

<p>
The requirement of disjoint domains could easily be dropped by making
the interpretation of predicates world-relative and assuming that the
counterpart relation links world-individual pairs. This would not
affect the logic.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If we further assume that the counterpart relation is an equivalence
relation and that it relates every individual at any world to exactly
one individual at every other world, then the resulting semantics is
equivalent to constant-domain Kripke semantics. (See e.g., Hughes
&amp; Cresswell 1996, 354f.)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Lewis assumes that the language of quantified modal logic does not
have names or function symbols. He suggests that English names should
be analysed as wide-scope Russellian descriptions (Lewis 1968,
120f.). To simplify the following discussion, we will assume that
there are names &lsquo;\(a\)&rsquo; and &lsquo;\(b\)&rsquo; that semantically
behave like free variables, insofar as their reference is shifted by
the modal operators. See Ghilardi &amp; Meloni (1991) for how to add
function symbols, and Schurz (1997), Fitting (2004), Kracht &amp; Kutz
(2005) among others, for alternative treatments of names in
counterpart semantics.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Since quantifiers are actualist, the interpretation of closed formulas
only requires interpreting formulas relative to a world \(w\) and
assignment \(g\) that maps every variable to an individual in \(w\).
Accordingly, we will assume that the names &lsquo;a&rsquo; and
&lsquo;b&rsquo; (initially) pick out individuals in the actual world.
See Forbes (1985), Kracht &amp; Kutz (2005), Kracht &amp; Kutz (2007),
Kupffer (2010), among others, for counterpart semantics for a language
with &ldquo;possibilist&rdquo; quantifiers.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Lewis&rsquo;s original semantics does not allow associating different
counterpart relations with different terms. In Lewis (1971, 209) he
says that he does not know how to allow for this in a formal
semantics, because it is not clear how the relevant counterpart
relations are determined. See Ramachandran (1998), Fara (2012),
Schwarz (2014), Kocurek (2018), among others, for relevant
proposals.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Lewis&rsquo;s original semantics also does not allow imposing
constraints on the choice of counterparts for formulas that are
&ldquo;multiply de re&rdquo; (see Hazen 1979, 328f.; Lewis 1983d,
44f.). To get around this, one can assume that the counterpart
relation relates not individuals, but sequences of individuals
(roughly as in Lewis 1983d). Alternatively, one can replace the
single counterpart relation by a set of counterpart relations
(see below, section 4).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="deviance">Deviance</h3>

<p>
It is often suggested that Lewis&rsquo;s semantics gives rise to a
deviant and unmanageable logic. Here is a sample of non-standard
features.</p>

<p>
F1. Familiar principles of S5 modal logic such as \(\Box A \rightarrow \Box \Box A\)
or \(\Diamond A \rightarrow \Box \Diamond A\) are invalid, even if
the accessibility relation is universal. (See e.g., Lewis 1968;
Forbes 1982, Cresswell 2004.)</p>

<p>
F2. The &ldquo;Necessity of Identity&rdquo;
\(\Box \forall x \forall y (x=y \rightarrow \Box x=y)\) and the
&ldquo;Necessity of Distinctness&rdquo;
\(\Box \forall x \forall y (x \neq y \rightarrow \Box x \neq y)\) are invalid.
(See e.g., Hazen 1979; Ramachandran 2008.)</p>

<p>
F3. The &ldquo;Necessity of Existence&rdquo;
\(\forall y \Box \exists x (x=y)\) and the Converse Barcan Formula
\(\Box \forall x A \rightarrow \forall x \Box A\) are valid. (See
e.g., Lewis 1968; Forbes 1982.)</p>

<p>
F4. Modal contexts are not closed under logical consequence. For
example, \(\Box (A \land B) \rightarrow \Box A\) is invalid, and so is
\(\Box (A \rightarrow B) \rightarrow (\Box A \rightarrow \Box B)\) or
\(\Box Rab \rightarrow \Box \exists x Rax\). (See e.g., Hazen 1979,
Woollaston 1994.)</p>

<p>
F5. Familiar substitution rules of first-order logic appear to be
invalid. For example, \(\forall x \Diamond x \neq a\) does not entail
\(\Diamond a \neq a\). (See e.g., Kripke 1980, fn 13; Woollaston
1994.)</p>

<p>
F6. If the language of quantified modal logic is extended by an
&lsquo;actually&rsquo; operator, we seem to get a deviant logic for
the extended language. (See e.g., Hazen 1979; Fara &amp; Williamson
2005.)</p>

<p>
It will be useful to look at these issues in terms of their causes. F1
arises from the assumption that the counterpart relation is not an
equivalence relation. F2, F5, and F6 arise from the possibility of
non-functional and non-injective counterpart relations. F3, F4, and
other aspects of F6 arise from the possibility that an individual may
lack a counterpart at some accessible world.</p>

<p>
As we will see, in each case one can argue that the non-standard
feature should be embraced, but one can also adjust the semantics so
as to block the feature.</p>

<h3 id="non-equivalence">Non-equivalence</h3>

<p>
In propositional
<a href="../logic-modal/index.html">modal logic</a>,
there is a well-known correspondence between modal schemas and
properties of the accessibility relation:
\(\Box A \rightarrow \Box \Box A\) is valid on a relational frame iff the accessibility
relation is transitive; \(A \rightarrow \Box \Diamond A\) is valid iff the
relation is symmetric; and so on. In Lewis&rsquo;s semantics, these
results do not carry over to quantified modal logic. For example,
\(\Box A \rightarrow \Box \Box A\) can be invalid even though the
accessibility relation is transitive, provided that the counterpart
relation is intransitive.</p>

<p>
In the main entry,
we mentioned that this might be seen as an advantage of counterpart
semantics, since it allows for a resolution of puzzles like the
Chisholm-Chandler paradox, where we seem to have an intuitive
counterexample to \(\Box A \rightarrow \Box \Box A\). Counterpart
semantics promises to vindicate the intuition without assuming that
metaphysical accessibility is not an equivalence relation.</p>

<p>
If one wants \(\Box A \rightarrow \Box \Box A\) to be valid for
metaphysical modality (despite apparent counterexamples), one can
simply assume that the counterpart relation for this application is
transitive. Lewis himself rejected transitivity, but he was open to
the idea that the metaphysical counterparthood relation is symmetric
(see Beebee &amp; Fisher 2020, Volume 1, Letter 137).</p>

<p>
Reasoning about metaphysical modality is not the only application of
modal logic. Counterpart semantics has found applications in many
other areas, from temporal logic (e.g., Sider 1996) to epistemic
logic (e.g., van Rooij 2006) to algebraic topology
(e.g., Bra&uuml;ner &amp; Ghilardi 2007). Different applications
might call for different logics. Relational semantics for
propositional modal logic is popular in part because it allows
defining a wide range of logics by putting restrictions on the
accessibility relation. Counterpart semantics similarly allows
defining a wider range of logics by putting joint constraints on
accessibility and counterparthood.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-counterparts-and-common-counterparts">Multiple counterparts and common counterparts</h3>

<p>
Lewis&rsquo;s semantics allows for cases in which an individual has
several counterparts at an accessible world, and for cases in which
several individuals have a common counterpart at a world. This has
some noteworthy consequences.</p>

<p>
For one thing, the &ldquo;Necessity of Identity&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Necessity of Distinctness&rdquo; become invalid. Informally, if
&lsquo;\(a\)&rsquo; and &lsquo;\(b\)&rsquo; pick out an individual with two
counterparts at some accessible world, then \(\Box a = a\) is true,
because every counterpart of \(a\) at every accessible world is
identical to itself, but \(\Box a = b\) is false, because not every
counterpart of \(a\) is identical to every counterpart of
\(b\).</p>

<p>
Multiple counterparts create a special challenge if the modal language
is extended by operators that shift the point of evaluation to a
single world, such as nominals, Stalnaker-type counterfactuals, or an
&lsquo;actually&rsquo; operator (\(\mathsf{ACT}\)). Suppose some
possible individual has two counterparts in the actual world, one of
which satisfies \(\phi(x)\) and the other does not. Should we regard
\(\Diamond \exists x \mathsf{ACT} \ \phi(x)\) as true or false? The
first answer renders \(\Diamond \exists x (\mathsf{ACT} \ Fx \land
\mathsf{ACT} \ \neg Fx)\) satisfiable; the second \(\Diamond \exists x
(\neg \mathsf{ACT} \ Fx \land \neg \mathsf{ACT} \ \neg Fx)\). Some
intuit that both answers are problematic. (See e.g., Hazen 1979;
Fara &amp; Williamson 2005.)</p>

<p>
It has also been suggested that allowing for multiple counterparts
invalidates familiar rules and axioms of classical predicate logic.
For example, since \(\Box a = a\) and \(a=b\) do not entail \(\Box a = b\),
&ldquo;Leibniz&rsquo;s Law&rdquo; seems to become invalid. The same is
true for Universal Instantiation. For example, \(\forall x \Diamond (x \neq a)\)
does not entail \(\Diamond a \neq a\). (See e.g., Kripke 1980, fn.13;
Woollaston 1994, 259; Cresswell 2004, 35.) Since Leibniz&rsquo;s
Law and Universal Instantiation remain valid for non-modal formulas,
Lewis&rsquo;s logic also appears to violate closure under second-order
substitution. (See Bauer &amp; Wansing 2002).</p>

<p>
Lewis (1983d) rejects the charge that his semantics invalidates rules
of classical logic. Universal Instantiation and Leibniz&rsquo;s Law
both involve substitution of terms, and Lewis points out that such
rules always require a proviso to deal with the possibility of
&ldquo;capturing&rdquo;. In classical predicate logic, for example,
\(x=y \rightarrow (\exists y (x \neq y) \rightarrow \exists y (y \neq
y))\) is not a proper instance of Leibniz&rsquo; Law, because the
variable &lsquo;\(y\)&rsquo; gets captured by the quantifier
&lsquo;\(\exists y\)&rsquo;. In Lewis&rsquo;s semantics, modal
operators function as unselective binders, capturing all variables in
their scope. We should therefore not be surprised that substitution
rules have to be restricted.  Schwarz (2012, 17f.) defines a general
restriction, analogous to the condition that a variable must be
&ldquo;free for&rdquo; another variable in classical predicate
logic. A popular alternative in counterpart semantics is to introduce
special syntactic machinery such as \(\lambda\)-abstraction that
allows distinguishing between <em>de re</em> readings and <em>de
dicto</em> readings. Substitution is then allowed only in <em>de
re</em> contexts, and the \(\lambda\)-conversion rules are restricted
(see Ghilardi &amp; Meloni 1988; Corsi 2002; and Schwarz 2013 (Other
Internet Resources) for details).</p>

<p>
The fact still remains that allowing for multiple (and common)
counterparts renders many rules and sentences invalid that are valid
in Kripke semantics. Like in the previous section, we can distinguish
two kinds of response. One is to embrace the deviance, another is to
block it.</p>

<p>
Along the first line, one might argue that allowing for contingent
identity and distinctness is useful to defuse philosophical puzzles.
Relevant puzzles would not include the putative identity between
persons and bodies or statues and pieces of clay. In Lewis&rsquo;s
semantics, \(a=b \rightarrow (\Diamond Fa \rightarrow \Diamond Fb)\)
is valid, so we can&rsquo;t account for identical things that appear
to have different modal properties. Here we would need models with
different counterpart relations (see comment 5 in section 1), so that
we could have worlds where someone&rsquo;s <em>person counterpart</em>
is not identical to their <em>body counterpart</em>.  Contingent
identity in Lewis&rsquo;s original semantics instead involves multiple
counterparts relative to the same counterpart relation.</p>

<p>
As mentioned in the main entry, relevant puzzles for this kind of
multiple counterparthood might be cases of fission, fusion, or
time-travel in the temporal dimension, and cases of <em>possible</em>
fission, fusion, or time-travel in the modal dimension. Schwarz (2012)
argues that such cases also call for a deviant logic of actually. (See
also Stalnaker 1986, 136f.)</p>

<p>
Further motivation for Lewis&rsquo;s non-standard treatment of
substitution comes from applications of modal logic outside
metaphysics. Ninan (2018) invokes multiple counterparts to explain
certain puzzles about epistemic modality. Bra&uuml;ner &amp; Ghilardi
(2007, 599&ndash;607, 614f.) present a range of mathematical applications
that seem to call for a logic with the Lewisian restrictions on
substitution.</p>

<p>
For some application, one might still prefer a more orthodox logic of
quantification, identity, and actuality. This can be achieved in
several ways.</p>

<p>
One obvious move is to simply restrict the relevant models to ones in
which the counterpart relation is functional and/or injective (see
e.g., Torza 2011).</p>

<p>
This may appear to be at odds with Lewis&rsquo;s assumption that
counterparthood is a matter of qualitative similarity. In a world of
two-way eternal recurrence, for example, the individuals in any epoch
are perfect qualitative duplicates of individuals in every other
epoch; a qualitative counterpart relation can then hardly select
exactly one of the individuals as, say, Joe Biden&rsquo;s
counterpart.</p>

<p>
However, every Lewisian counterpart relation \(C\) can be unravelled into
a set \(F\) of functional and injective counterpart relations: if \(x\) at \(w\)
has two counterparts \(y\) and \(y^\prime\) at \(v\), then one of the unravelled
relations will link \(x\) with \(y\), another will link \(x\) with \(y^\prime\). We
can easily adjust Lewis&rsquo;s semantics to quantify over the
unravelled relations:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
\(\Box \phi\) is true relative to \(w,g\) iff \(\phi\) is true relative to
every world \(w^\prime\) accessible from \(w\) and every assignment \(g^\prime\)
such that for every \(f \in F\) and every variable \(x\) that is free in \(phi\), \(g^\prime(x)\) stands in \(f\) to \(g(x)\).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This kind of <em>functional counterpart semantics</em> was first
introduced in Hazen (1977) and Hazen (1979), and has been explored in
different forms by many authors; see e.g., Ghilardi (1991),
Stalnaker (1994), Stalnaker (2012) (ch.3 and p154ff.), Sider (2008,
Other Internet Resources), Kupffer (2010), Russell (2013), Bacon
(2014).</p>

<p>
The triple quantification in the clause for the box (over worlds,
counterparts, and unravelled counterpart relations) may initially seem
ad hoc, but it can be given independent motivation.</p>

<p>
For one, it allows putting restrictions on the choice of counterparts
for &ldquo;multiply de re&rdquo; sentences. Suppose we judge that
Elizabeth II is necessarily the daughter of George VI, even though
both have many counterparts in a world of eternal recurrence, so that
not every counterpart of Elizabeth is the daughter of every
counterpart of George. On the functional approach, we can restrict the
set of counterpart relations \(F\) so that all its members link Elizabeth
to an Elizabeth counterpart who is the daughter of the George
counterpart linked to George. (In that case, \(F\) is no longer construed
by unravelling a simple Lewisian counterpart relation.)</p>

<p>
The functional approach can also be motivated by Lewis&rsquo;s (1986e,
231f.) distinction between possible worlds and &ldquo;individual
possibilities&rdquo;. Intuitively, a world of eternal recurrence
represents one possibility for the world, but many
possibilities <em>for us</em>. In general, if a world contains
multiple counterparts of a given individual, then the world might be
regarded as multiple possibilities for that individual, one for each
counterpart. Likewise, a possibility for <em>n</em> individuals might
be represented as a pair of a possible world and <em>n</em> (suitably
coordinated) counterparts of the original individuals at the world. In
a functional model, each unraveled counterpart relation selects a
unique counterpart for every individual at every accessible world. By
quantifying over both worlds and unraveled counterpart relations, the
revised clause for the box effectively quantifies over all relevant
individual possibilities.</p>

<p>
Surprisingly, the extra layer of quantification (over counterpart
relations) has also proved useful in mathematical logic.</p>

<p>
A well-known limitation of Kripke semantics for quantified modal logic
is that many important systems of propositional modal logic become
incomplete when quantifiers are added. For example, Ghilardi (1991)
proves&mdash;with the help of functional counterpart
semantics&mdash;that every quantified system in between S4.3 and S5 is
incomplete with respect to (variable-domain) Kripke semantics. (With
constant domains, things are even worse; see e.g., Hughes &amp;
Cresswell 1996, 265&ndash;71.) In Ghilardi (1992), Ghilardi shows that
this problem disappears in functional counterpart semantics, where the
quantified extension of every canonical propositional modal logic
above S4 is complete.</p>

<p>
This formal advantage of counterpart semantics requires multiple
counterpart relations (see Kracht &amp; Kutz 2005, sec.7), but it does
not require the relations to be functional and injective.
Ghilardi&rsquo;s result trivially generalises to a semantics with
multiple, possibly non-functional, counterpart relations. See Kutz
(2000), Kracht &amp; Kutz (2002), Kracht &amp; Kutz (2005), and
Schwarz (2013, Other Internet Resources) for investigations into this
kind of semantics.</p>

<h3 id="missing-counterparts">Missing counterparts</h3>

<p>
Lewis does not assume that every individual has a counterpart at every
world. This is meant to capture the intuition that most of us could
have failed to exist. Oddly, however, \(\forall x \Box \exists y (x=y)\)
comes out valid by Lewis&rsquo;s translation rules, and so does the
Converse Barcan Formula \(\Box \forall x A \rightarrow \forall x \Box A\).
What becomes invalid instead are some basic principles of normal
propositional modal logic. For example, \(\Box (Fa \land Gb)\) does not
entail \(\Box Fa\).</p>

<p>
Here is why. In Lewis&rsquo;s semantics, \(\Box Fa\) is true iff all
counterparts of \(a\) at all worlds are \(F\); equivalently:
iff at all worlds where \(a\) has a counterpart, all these
counterparts are \(F\). Similarly, \(\Box (Fa \land Gb)\) is true
iff at all worlds where \(a\) and \(b\) both have
counterparts, all the \(a\)-counterparts are \(F\) and all
the \(b\)-counterparts \(G\). If \(a\) has
non-\(F\) counterparts, but only in worlds where \(b\) has
no counterparts, then \(\Box (Fa \land Gb)\) is true while \(\Box Fa\) is
false.</p>

<p>
We can also see why \(\forall x \Box \exists y (x=y)\) is valid.
\(\Box \exists y (x=y)\) is true iff at every world where \(x\) has a
counterpart, all these counterparts are identical to something.</p>

<p>
As Hazen (1979, 327f.) notes, these results are the consequence of a
semantic choice that is independent of questions about trans-world
identity. Kripke (1971, 137) distinguished two readings of a statement
like &lsquo;Joe Biden is necessarily human&rsquo;. On its
&ldquo;weak&rdquo; reading, the statement expresses that Biden is
human at all worlds at which he exists. On its &ldquo;strong&rdquo;
reading, the sentence expresses that Biden is human at all worlds
whatsoever. Lewis adopts the weak reading. He assumes that \(\Box Hb\)
is meant to formalise the hypothesis that it is &ldquo;necessary for
Biden&rdquo; that he is human, meaning that he is human at all worlds
where he exists (in the sense of having a counterpart).</p>

<p>
On the weak reading of the box, the validity of \(\forall x \Box
\exists y (x=y)\) and the Converse Barcan Formula should be
unsurprising. The formulas do not express that everything exists at
all accessible worlds. (This rather corresponds to \(\exists x \Box
\phi \rightarrow \Box \exists x \phi\); see Ghilardi &amp; Meloni
1988.) It should also be unsurprising that \(\Box (Fa \land Gb)
\rightarrow \Box Fa\) becomes invalid, unless we assume that
everything exists at (or has a counterpart at) all accessible
worlds. We would get the same non-standard logic if we tracked
individuals by identity rather than by the counterpart relation.</p>

<p>
Lewis acknowledged the problem raised by the validity of
\(\forall x \Box \exists y (x=y)\). He agreed that a sentence like
&lsquo;Joe Biden necessarily exists&rsquo; is intuitively false. But
he saw no systematic way of getting \(\Box Hb\) to be true while
\(\Box \exists x (x=b)\) is false (Lewis (1986e): 11-13). This is one of
the considerations that led him to conclude that English modal
sentences can&rsquo;t be adequately translated into the standard
language of quantified modal logic.</p>

<p>
There are further reasons to doubt that the language of quantified modal logic is adequate to
formalise claims about individual possibility (or weak necessity). For
example, we might intuit that George VI could have existed without
having any children, while Queen Elizabeth II could not have existed
without having George VI as her father. That is, we might want to say
that it is necessary <em>for Elizabeth</em> that she is the daughter
of George, although it is not necessary <em>for George</em> that
Elizabeth is his daughter: \(\Box Fab\) should be true relative to
\(a\) but not relative to \(b\). The standard language of
quantified modal logic does not allow drawing this distinction
(compare Hunter &amp; Seager 1981, 74f.). Similarly, there is no
natural way to say that it is jointly necessary <em>for Elizabeth and
George</em> that George has a daughter.</p>

<p>
These considerations suggest that if we want to adopt Lewis&rsquo;s
preferred reading of <em>de re</em> modal statements, we should adjust
the syntax of quantified modal logic. Corsi (2007) introduces special
boxes and diamonds that can bind singular terms. Ghilardi &amp; Meloni
(1988), Ghilardi &amp; Meloni (1991), and Ghilardi (2001) instead
follow a long-standing tradition in categorical logic of using a typed
language. The properly typed versions of all K-schemas then become
valid. Informally, if \(Fa \land Fb\) is necessary <em>for \(a\) and
\(b\)</em>, then \(Fa\) is also necessary <em>for \(a\) and
\(b\)</em>.</p>

<p>
Bra&uuml;ner &amp; Ghilardi (2007) present a complete axiomatisation
of Lewis&rsquo;s semantics for a typed language, along with some
mathematical applications. One interesting aspect of this framework is
that some logical principles that are connected in Kripke semantics
become independent in counterpart semantics. For example, making both
accessibility and counterparthood an equivalence relation results in a
logic that validates (typed versions of) all the S5 schemas, but fails
to validate the Barcan Formula (see Ghilardi 2001, 105ff.).</p>

<p>
An advantage of reading the box as weak necessity is that we
don&rsquo;t need to think about how a formula should be interpreted
relative to a world if one of its terms does not pick out any
individual in that world (see comment 4 in section 1).
 However, the issue must still be faced if an &lsquo;actually&rsquo;
operator is added to the language. The &lsquo;actually&rsquo; operator
is supposed to shift the point of evaluation back to the actual world,
irrespective of whether the relevant individuals exist here; so we
have to explain how to interpret \(\mathsf{ACT} \ \phi(x)\) if the value of
\(x\) has no counterpart in the actual world (see e.g., Fara &amp;
Williamson 2005).</p>

<p>
From a technical perspective, an easy way to avoid all complications
arising from missing counterparts is to stipulate that&mdash;perhaps
for certain applications&mdash;every individual at every world has a
counterpart at every world. This move resembles assuming constant
domains in Kripke semantics. It makes the &ldquo;weak&rdquo; reading
of the box equivalent to the &ldquo;strong&rdquo; reading. Like in
Kripke semantics, the assumption simplifies the logic, but may be
regarded as philosophically problematic. To avoid rendering
\(\forall x \Box \exists y (x=y)\) valid, one may add that the quantifiers
only range over some of the individuals at the relevant world,
distinguishing between an &ldquo;inner&rdquo; and an &ldquo;outer
domain&rdquo; (see e.g., Forbes 1982; Forbes 1985; Kracht &amp;
Kutz 2002; Varzi 2020).</p>

<p>
One can also replace Lewis&rsquo;s weak reading of the box by a strong
reading without assuming that everything has a counterpart at every
world. Instead, one can assume that when modal operators shift the point of
evaluation to another world, then the relevant terms either pick out a
counterpart of their previous referent at that world, or they become
empty. One then has a range of familiar options from
 <a href="../logic-free/index.html">free logic</a> 
 for how to interpret formulas with empty terms. (See e.g., Stalnaker
1994 and Schwarz 2012; also Ramachandran 1989 for a related approach.)</p>

<h3><a name="1">1. Introduction to Supplement</a></h3>

<p>

This supplement provides a brief account of the conceptions of 
analysis involved in ancient Greek geometry and Plato&rsquo;s and 
Aristotle&rsquo;s philosophies. The aim is not to explore in any 
detail the intricate conceptual, textual and historical 
interrelationships but simply to highlight the key features of the 
relevant methodologies. Central to these methodologies is the 
regressive conception of analysis, as outlined in 
 <a href="index-2.html#AncConc">&sect;2</a>
 of the main document.</p>

<p>


 <a href="bib2.html#2.1" name="return-1">Annotated Bibliography, &sect;2.1</a>
 </p>

<h3><a name="2">2. Ancient Greek Geometry</a></h3>

<p>

Immediately after his characterization of the method of analysis and 
synthesis in his <em>Mathematical Collection</em> (as quoted in 
 <a href="index-2.html#AncConc">&sect;2</a>
 of the main document), Pappus goes on:</p>

<blockquote>Now analysis is of two kinds. One seeks the truth, being
called theoretical. The other serves to carry out what was desired to
do, and this is called problematical. In the theoretical kind we
suppose the thing sought as being and as being true, and then we pass
through its concomitants (<em>akolouth&ocirc;n</em>) in order, as
though they were true and existent by hypothesis, to something
admitted; then, if that which is admitted be true, the thing sought is
true, too, and the proof will be the reverse of analysis. But if we
come upon something false to admit, the thing sought will be false,
too. In the problematic kind we suppose the desired thing to be known,
and then we pass through its concomitants (<em>akolouth&ocirc;n</em>)
in order, as though they were true, up to something admitted. If the
thing admitted is possible or can be done, that is, if it is what the
mathematicians call given, the desired thing will also be possible. The
proof will again be the reverse of analysis. But if we come upon
something impossible to admit, the problem will also be impossible. [<a href="s1.html#Pappus">Full Quotation</a>]</blockquote>

<p>

According to Pappus, then, a distinction should be drawn between 
theoretical and problematical analysis, depending on whether we are 
seeking to demonstrate a theorem (such as Pythagoras&rsquo;s theorem)
or to carry out a construction (such as constructing an equilateral 
triangle on a given line). This distinction was also stressed by the 
last of the great classical Greek philosophers, the Neoplatonist 
Proclus, who wrote a commentary on the first Book of Euclid&rsquo;s 
<em>Elements</em> in the fifth century 
 [<a href="s1.html#Proclus">Quotations</a>].
 Geometry, Proclus remarks, &ldquo;is divided into the working out of 
problems and the discovery of theorems. It calls 
&ldquo;problems&rdquo; those propositions whose aim is to produce, 
bring into view, or construct what in a sense does not exist, and 
&ldquo;theorems&rdquo; those whose purpose is to see, identify, and 
demonstrate the existence or nonexistence of an attribute.&rdquo; 
(<em>CEE</em>, 157; cf. 63.) Although Euclid&rsquo;s 
&lsquo;Propositions&rsquo; do divide into theorems and problems, 
however, these are complementary, since, for every construction we 
carry out fulfilling the required conditions, there is a 
corresponding theorem to be proved demonstrating that the 
construction has the desired properties, and for every theorem, there
will be some associated construction to be made. Pythagoras&rsquo;s 
theorem, for example, might be put in &lsquo;problematic&rsquo; form 
thus: &ldquo;To construct three squares, one on each side of a 
triangle, such that the square on the longer side is equal to the 
other two squares.&rdquo; The analysis required to solve this problem
will at the same time provide the material to demonstrate 
Pythagoras&rsquo;s theorem itself.</p>

<p>

What analysis involves is the finding of appropriate principles, 
previously proved theorems, and constructional moves by means of 
which the problem can be solved (the desired figure constructed or 
the relevant theorem proved). Within Euclidean geometry, the 
constructional moves must be in accord with the first three 
postulates (drawing a line between any two points, extending a line 
and drawing a circle with any given center and radius). Working back 
to principles (axioms) and previously proved theorems suggests that 
the regressive conception of analysis reflected in Pappus&rsquo;s 
account is indeed central. But it is not the only conception involved
in ancient Greek geometrical analysis. The main aim in identifying 
appropriate principles and previously proved theorems is to reduce 
the problem set to a number of simpler problems which either have 
already been solved or can more easily be solved, so that 
transformation and resolution are also involved. That analysis 
includes both transformation and resolution has been noted by a 
number of commentators (see esp. Hankel 1874, 137-50; Heath 
<em>E</em>, I, 140-2).</p>

<p>

The most important feature of ancient Greek geometrical analysis 
concerns the role played by the construction of figures, and in 
particular, by the construction of auxiliary lines&mdash;lines that 
are not strictly part of the figures that are mentioned in the 
specification of the problem but which are essential in arriving at 
those figures or proving the relevant theorem. Not only does this 
suggest that analysis is more creative than is usually supposed today
(inspiration may be required in coming up with appropriate auxiliary 
lines), but it also makes the examination of the interrelationships 
between the various elements of the constructions a crucial part of 
analysis. This aspect has been stressed by Hintikka and Remes in 
their classic study of the method of analysis in ancient Greek 
geometry (1974). Hintikka and Remes distinguish between 
<em>directional</em> and <em>configurational</em> analysis, 
corresponding, respectively, to the regressive and decompositional 
conceptions outlined in the main document 
 (<a href="index-2.html#1.1">&sect;1.1</a>),
 and argue that the latter is of far greater importance than the 
former. This may be overcompensating for the one-sidedness of the 
&lsquo;directional&rsquo; interpretation, but there is no doubt that 
configurational analysis does play an essential role. Although there 
is continuing debate as to the nature of analysis in ancient Greek 
geometry, it is certainly more complex than suggested by 
Pappus&rsquo;s classic account. (See especially Knorr 1993, Behboud 
1994, Netz 2000.)</p>

<p>

A further issue raised by Pappus&rsquo;s text concerns the problem of
reversibility. If we translate the term 
&lsquo;<em>akolouth&ocirc;n</em>&rsquo; by 
&lsquo;consequences&rsquo;, as Heath, for example, does (<em>E</em>, 
I, 138-9), then it looks as if Pappus conceives analysis and 
synthesis as deductively symmetrical. We assume &lsquo;what is 
sought&rsquo; and follow through its consequences until we reach 
something accepted as true, when we reverse the process and derive 
the consequences of what we reached, in demonstrating the truth of 
what we sought. But this raises an obvious objection. For if 
<em>Q</em> is a consequence of <em>P</em>, it does not necessarily 
follow that <em>P</em> is a consequence of <em>Q</em>; so that 
deriving the consequences of &lsquo;what is sought&rsquo; will not 
necessarily yield principles that can then be used to prove it. There
is normally no backward road from consequents to antecedents.</p>

<p>

There are two responses to this. One is to deny that 
&lsquo;<em>akolouth&ocirc;n</em>&rsquo; is to be understood as 
&lsquo;consequences&rsquo; (in the logical sense) and to interpret it
as something more like &lsquo;concomitants&rsquo;&mdash;in the weaker
sense of &lsquo;things that go together with one another&rsquo;. 
Hintikka and Remes have powerfully argued for this interpretation, 
pointing out, for example, that Pappus seems to distinguish between 
&lsquo;<em>akolouth&ocirc;n</em>&rsquo; (&lsquo;concomitants&rsquo;) 
and &lsquo;<em>epomena</em>&rsquo;, which does appear to mean 
&lsquo;consequents&rsquo; here (1974, ch. 2; 89-91). The other 
response is to accept the understanding of 
&lsquo;<em>akolouth&ocirc;n</em>&rsquo; as 
&lsquo;consequences&rsquo;, but to then insist on the reversibility 
of all the steps (i.e., that what we typically have here are 
equivalences and not just implications), pointing out that this is 
precisely why synthesis is also needed, to show that the steps 
<em>are</em> reversible. These two responses are not necessarily in 
conflict, however. &lsquo;<em>akolouth&ocirc;n</em>&rsquo; may mean 
&lsquo;concomitants&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;consequences&rsquo;, 
but investigating consequences may be one way of finding concomitants
that can then be used in a rigorous synthesis. The issue of 
reversibility was to be a major theme in the history of the 
regressive conception of analysis.</p>

<h3><a name="3">3. Plato</a></h3>

<p>

If one root of modern conceptions of analysis lies in ancient Greek 
geometry, the other main root lies in the elenctic method followed by
the Socrates of Plato&rsquo;s early dialogues. The term 
&lsquo;elenctic&rsquo; derives from the Greek word 
&lsquo;<em>elenchein</em>&rsquo;, meaning to cross-examine or refute,
and Socrates&rsquo;s method consists in asking questions of the form 
&lsquo;What is <em>F</em>?&rsquo;, where &lsquo;<em>F</em>&rsquo; is 
typically the name of some virtue, and attempting to find a 
definition through dialogue with his interlocutors. For example, the 
question in the <em>Charmides</em> is &lsquo;What is temperance 
[<em>s&ocirc;phrosun&ecirc;</em>]?&rsquo;, in the <em>Laches</em> 
&lsquo;What is courage [<em>andreia</em>]?&rsquo;, in the 
<em>Euthyphro</em> &lsquo;What is piety 
[<em>hosiot&ecirc;s</em>]?&rsquo;, and in the <em>Meno</em> 
&lsquo;What is virtue [<em>aret&ecirc;</em>]?&rsquo; On the whole, 
commentators agree that what Socrates is seeking are real rather than
nominal definitions, definitions that specify the essential nature of
the thing concerned rather than the properties by means of which we 
can recognise it or the meaning of the term used to designate it. But
there has been more controversy over precisely what the 
presuppositions of the elenctic method are, and how to respond, in 
particular, to the charge that Socrates commits the so-called 
Socratic fallacy. Socrates appears to be committed to the principle 
that if one does not know what the <em>F</em> is, then one cannot 
know if <em>F</em> is truly predicable of anything whatever, in which
case it seems pointless to try to discover what the <em>F</em> is by 
investigating examples of it via the elenctic method.</p>

<p>

Plato can be seen as facing up to this charge in the <em>Meno</em>, 
the dialogue that marks the transition from his early to his later 
work. If Socratic definition anticipates conceptual analysis, then 
the paradox that is formulated in this dialogue&mdash;Meno&rsquo;s 
paradox&mdash;anticipates the paradox of analysis. Either we know 
what something is, or we do not. If we do, then there is no point 
searching for it. If we do not, then we will not know what to search 
for. (Cf. <em>Meno</em>, 80d-e.) It is in response to this paradox 
that Plato introduces his theory of recollection, about which there 
has been enormous controversy, and his conception of knowledge as 
true belief plus an account. But what is of greatest significance in 
this dialogue, as far as analysis is concerned, is Socrates&rsquo;s 
famous interrogation of the slave-boy. For it is here that he 
discusses a geometrical problem, and shows the emerging influence of 
Greek geometry.</p>

<p>

The influence of Greek geometry, and of the method of analysis, in 
particular, is evident in Plato&rsquo;s introduction of the method of
hypothesis, described and applied in the <em>Meno</em> (86e-87b), and
discussed further in the <em>Phaedo</em> (100a-101d). Just as in 
geometrical analysis, the idea is to &lsquo;hypothesize&rsquo; some 
supposedly prior proposition (e.g. that virtue is knowledge) by means
of which the proposition under consideration (e.g. that virtue comes 
from teaching) can be demonstrated. As in the case of geometrical 
analysis, there has been a great deal of controversy over what the 
relationships are supposed to be between the various elements 
involved here, and there are also important <em>differences</em> 
between geometrical analysis and the method of hypothesis. But it 
does seem that interpreting the method of hypothesis against the 
background of ancient Greek geometry is the right approach (see esp. 
Sayre 1969, Mueller 1992).</p>

<p>

In the later dialogues, Plato both refines his conception of 
knowledge as true belief plus an account (in the <em>Theaetetus</em>)
and develops the method of hypothesis into the method of collection 
and division (in the <em>Phaedrus</em>, <em>Sophist</em>, 
<em>Politicus</em> and <em>Philebus</em>). The latter method 
involves, paradigmatically (but not exclusively), 
&lsquo;collecting&rsquo; things generically and then 
&lsquo;dividing&rsquo; them by a series of dichotomies into species. 
This is Plato&rsquo;s mature method, in which we can see the method 
of analysis adapted to provide a metaphysical framework for his 
Socratic concern with definition. Although many have criticised the 
method of division, most notably, Ryle (1966), who wished to 
distinguish it from genuine philosophy or dialectic, it does seem 
that, properly understood, it forms the heart of Plato&rsquo;s later 
methodology. Its importance lies not just in the resulting 
classificatory trees but in the structural relationships they reveal 
and the insights it encourages into the formal concepts involved (cf.
Ackrill 1970).</p>

<h3><a name="4">4. Aristotle</a></h3>

<p>

Plato was, without doubt, the major influence on Aristotle, who was 
trained in Plato&rsquo;s Academy. But this is not to say that 
Aristotle was not critical of Plato&rsquo;s methodology. He 
criticises the method of division, for example, in <em>Parts of 
Animals</em> (I, 2-3). But like Plato, he was inspired by ancient 
Greek geometry. There are three passages in which Aristotle directly 
refers to geometrical analysis. The most famous passage occurs in the
<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> (III, 3), in which Aristotle compares 
reasoning about the means to a given end to analysis in geometry 
 [<a href="s1.html#AristotleNE">Quotation</a>].
 Just as in geometrical analysis (see 
 <a href="index-2.html#AncConc">&sect;2</a>
 of the main document), we work back from what is sought to something 
we already know how to construct or prove, so too in practical 
deliberation, according to Aristotle, we work back from what we want 
to something which we know how to do, which results in what we want. 
The second passage occurs in section 16 of <em>On Sophistical 
Refutations</em>, where Aristotle considers the question of how we 
can learn to diagnose bad arguments 
 [<a href="s1.html#AristotleSR">Quotation</a>].
 Although the passage is not easy to interpret, his main point seems 
to be to emphasize that analysis must be supplemented by synthesis to
yield a full solution of anything. The third passage occurs in the 
<em>Posterior Analytics</em> (I, 12), in which Aristotle recognises 
the problem of reversibility mentioned at the end of 
 <a href="#2">&sect;2</a>
 above 
 [<a href="s1.html#AristotlePoA">Quotation</a>].
 </p>

<p>

But it is in relation to Aristotle&rsquo;s development of syllogistic
theory, expounded in the aptly named <em>Analytics</em>, that there 
are the most striking similarities. Just as the aim of the geometer 
is to solve geometrical problems (construct figures or prove 
theorems), so too Aristotle was concerned to solve logical problems 
(construct arguments or prove propositions). The <em>Prior 
Analytics</em> provides the framework to do this in the same way that
Euclid&rsquo;s <em>Elements</em> provided the framework in the case 
of geometry. And even more than in the case of geometry, analysis in 
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Analytics</em> involves not just the regression
to first principles, but also the entire process of elaborating the 
structural relations between the various elements of arguments and 
showing how one argument can be &lsquo;reduced&rsquo; to another. 
Arguments are &lsquo;analyzed&rsquo; to the extent that they can be 
set out as &lsquo;syllogisms&rsquo;, each syllogism being a 
combination of two premises and a conclusion taking one of the 
specified forms of valid inference. Working back from a given 
proposition, assumed as conclusion, to premises by means of which 
that proposition can be derived, is facilitated by a thorough 
training in the whole syllogistic system, which it was the aim of the
<em>Analytics</em> to provide. The richness of Aristotle&rsquo;s 
conception of analysis, and the influence of ancient Greek geometry, 
has been superbly elucidated by Patrick Byrne (1997).</p>

<p>

While the <em>Prior Analytics</em> is concerned with the theory of 
the syllogism in general, the <em>Posterior Analytics</em> is 
concerned with one particular type of syllogism, the demonstrative or
scientific syllogism. A demonstrative syllogism is &ldquo;one in 
virtue of which, by having it, we understand something&rdquo; 
(71b17-19), that is, one in which the premises are &ldquo;true and 
primitive and immediate and more familiar than and prior to and 
explanatory of the conclusion&rdquo; (71b21-2). Aristotle 
distinguishes between understanding &lsquo;the fact&rsquo; (<em>to 
hoti</em>) and understanding &lsquo;the reason why&rsquo; (<em>to 
dioti</em>). He gives the example of the following two syllogisms (I,
13):</p>

<p>

Both are valid arguments, but whilst the first merely &lsquo;gives 
the fact&rsquo;, the second &lsquo;gives the reason why&rsquo;, that 
is, the second provides an explanation of what is stated in the 
conclusion in terms of the more basic facts expressed by the 
premises. That the planets do not twinkle is hardly an explanation of
why they are near; but that they are near, according to Aristotle, is
(part of) an explanation of why they do not twinkle (78a23-b3).</p>

<p>

This distinction, and indeed the model of explanation involved here, 
was to play a crucial role in subsequent conceptions of analysis. For
causal explanation itself became identified with logical deduction, 
and the movement from cause to effect was represented as the passage 
from premises to conclusion in a logical argument, and the finding of
the cause of something as a matter of determining appropriate 
premises&mdash;something which could itself be done in a logical 
argument. On this conception, then, there could be a logic of 
discovery as well as a logic of proof. In the first case above, we 
start with an effect (the planets not twinkling) and determine its 
cause (the planets being near) by finding an appropriate additional 
premise, and in the second case, having determined the cause, we 
reverse the process to display the passage from cause to effect. The 
first was understood as <em>analysis</em>, providing a method of 
discovery, and the second as <em>synthesis</em>, providing a method 
of proof. Such a conception presupposes that the steps are reversible
(i.e., in this case, the convertibility of &lsquo;What does not 
twinkle is near&rsquo; and &lsquo;What is near does not 
twinkle&rsquo;), but with this assumption, there is a nice symmetry 
between analysis and synthesis. This conception of analysis and 
synthesis was to take center stage in the Renaissance and early 
modern period.</p>

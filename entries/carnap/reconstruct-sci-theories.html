<h2>E. The Reconstruction of Scientific Theories</h2>

<p>
Throughout his career, the rational reconstruction of scientific
theories constituted one of the cornerstones of Carnap&rsquo;s work
(see, e.g., Demopoulos 2007, Andreas 2007, Lutz 2012a,b for surveys).
For Carnap, this involved the reconstruction of the syntax and (later)
semantics of a scientific language in a formal framework, the
classification of scientific terms and sentences&mdash;as represented
in the framework&mdash;according to categories of philosophical
interest, and the reconstruction of a theory&rsquo;s deductive
structure and empirical justification with the help of the resources
of the framework. Logic was to supply the methods by which traditional
epistemology could be transformed into a &ldquo;logic of
science&rdquo;. The hope was that logical reconstruction would not
only clarify the structure, the foundations, and the applications of
science itself, but also make the philosophical analysis and
interpretation of science more transparent. This program became the
starting point of a new philosophical subdiscipline which we now call
&ldquo;philosophy of science&rdquo; (which is broader in scope now, of
course, than it was in Carnap&rsquo;s day):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The works of the Vienna Circle and related groups have as their object
to investigate science either as a whole or in its individual
branches: they analyse the concepts, sentences, proofs, and theories
that appear in different scientific fields, and they do this not so
much from the point of view of the historical development of science
as from the logical point of view. This field of work, for which there
exists as yet no commonly recognized general term, may perhaps be
called the theory of science and more precisely the <em>logic of
science</em>. By &ldquo;science&rdquo; is to be understood here the
totality of accepted sentences; and this includes not only the
assertions of the scientists but also those of everyday life; for
there is no sharp boundary between these two fields. (Carnap 1934,
&ldquo;The Task of the Logic of Science&rdquo;)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In what follows, we do not attempt an exhaustive survey of
Carnap&rsquo;s entire contribution to this subject, but touch first on
some general issues that have clouded the perception (and reception)
of Carnap&rsquo;s ideas, particularly Quine&rsquo;s critique of
Carnap&rsquo;s supposed &ldquo;reductionism&rdquo; in the period
<em>after</em> the <em>Aufbau</em>, and the critique by Quine and many
others of Carnap&rsquo;s &ldquo;verificationism&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;verification theory of meaning&rdquo;. Then we turn to
Carnap&rsquo;s later work on the reconstruction of scientific
theories, as exemplified in &ldquo;The Methodological Character of
Theoretical Concepts&rdquo; (1956a), &ldquo;Beobachtungssprache und
theoretische Sprache&rdquo; (1958, &ldquo;Observation Language and
Theoretical Language&rdquo;), &ldquo;Theoretical Concepts in
Science&rdquo; (1959a), some of Carnap&rsquo;s remarks in his Schilpp
volume (Carnap 1963a,b), and his <em>Philosophical Foundations of
Physics</em> (1966), among other texts. After a section reviewing the
critiques of this account, we address its structuralist tendency,
especially in the light of current discussions of &ldquo;structural
realism&rdquo;. </p>

<h3 id="QuinCritCarnReduVeriTheoMean">1. Quine&rsquo;s Critique of Carnap&rsquo;s Reductionism and the Verification Theory of Meaning</h3>

<p>
Quine (1951) thought the &ldquo;second dogma of empiricism&rdquo;,
<em>reductionism</em>, at odds with the holism about confirmation he
embraced in his own work. Quine regards Carnap&rsquo;s
&ldquo;reductionism&rdquo; to come in two versions, a radical one and
a less radical one, the former of which he associates with the
<em>Aufbau</em> (compare the supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html"><em>Aufbau</em></a>):</p>
 
<blockquote>

<p>
Radical reductionism&hellip; sets itself the task of specifying a
sense-datum language and showing how to translate the rest of
significant discourse, statement by statement, into it. Carnap
embarked on this project in the <em>Aufbau</em>. (Quine 1951: 36)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, Carnap holds explicitly in the <em>Aufbau</em> that there are
necessary and sufficient &ldquo;recognizable indicators&rdquo; for all
scientific states of affairs (&sect;49). Because the formulas of his
phenomenalist constitution system supposedly express these indicators,
Carnap takes each scientific statement to be translatable into the
language of the system without affecting its extension, that is, truth
value. Since, ultimately, all of these formulas quantify over (sets of
sets of&hellip;) elementary experiences without including any
primitive descriptive term other than &ldquo;<i>Er</i>&rdquo;, all
indicators may be viewed as constraints just on elementary experiences
and <i>Er</i>. Finally, in one passage of the <em>Aufbau</em>
(&sect;180), Carnap maintains that, </p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(I1)</dt>
<dd>since the experiencing and memorizing subject can, at least in
principle, determine whether an elementary experience stands in the
<i>Er</i> relation to another one, and </dd>
<dt>(I2)</dt>
<dd> since there are only finitely many elementary experiences (as
Carnap assumes), the subject is, in principle, in a position to
determine the truth value of any scientific statement. In other words:
there is no scientific question that does not have an answer.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Obviously, few philosophers today would go along with this conclusion
(any more than Carnap himself would later go along with it, after the
<em>Aufbau</em>): even if (I1) and (I2) were granted, the general
existence claim concerning recognizable indicators would be rejected,
and it would be denied that the translation from the language(s) of
science into that of Carnap&rsquo;s phenomenalist constitution system
would always preserve truth value (as Carnap himself denies this in
1936 in &sect;15 of <em>Testability and Meaning</em>). (Leitgeb 2011
argues, however, that Carnap&rsquo;s intended translation mapping in
the <em>Aufbau</em> might still preserve <em>empirical content</em>.)
So Quine does put his finger on a weak point of Carnap&rsquo;s
<em>Aufbau</em>; radical reductionism fails. For Quine&rsquo;s (1951)
closely related criticism of Carnap&rsquo;s attempt at defining
three-dimensional space from the two-dimensional visual field in the
<em>Aufbau</em>, see the supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html#QuinCritConsSpacLimiDefi"><em>Aufbau</em> (Section 4)</a>.</p>
 
<p>
While Quine acknowledges that Carnap no longer upheld &ldquo;radical
reductionism&rdquo; after the <em>Aufbau</em> (and even there had
perhaps not done so as far as the <em>physicalist</em> constitution
systems of the <em>Aufbau</em> are concerned), he also thinks that
Carnap&rsquo;s later work is still committed to a less radical variant
of reductionism:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Reductionism in its radical form has long since ceased to figure in
Carnap&rsquo;s philosophy. But the dogma of reductionism has, in a
subtler and more tenuous form, continued to influence the thought of
empiricists. The notion lingers that to each statement, or each
synthetic statement, there is associated a unique range of possible
sensory events such that the occurrence of any of them would add to
the likelihood of truth of the statement, and that there is associated
also another unique range of possible sensory events whose occurrence
would detract from that likelihood. This notion is of course implicit
in the verification theory of meaning.</p>

<p>
The dogma of reductionism survives in the supposition that each
statement, taken in isolation from its fellows, can admit of
confirmation or infirmation at all. My countersuggestion, issuing
essentially from Carnap&rsquo;s doctrine of the physical world in the
<em>Aufbau</em>, is that our statements about the external world face
the tribunal of sense experience not individually but only as a
corporate body. (Quine 1951: 38)</p>

<p>
The unit of empirical significance is the whole of science. (Quine
1951: 39)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Quine here attributes to Carnap (but is vague on the details) a less
radical form of reductionism that, he thinks, is
&ldquo;implicit&rdquo; in the &ldquo;verification theory of
meaning&rdquo; held by some parts of the Vienna Circle during certain
periods. About this supposed post-<em>Aufbau</em> non-radical
reductionism, Quine makes two further claims: first, (Q1) Quine claims
that the confirmation of scientific statements is holistic
(confirmation holism); it is not possible to confirm or disconfirm a
statement independently of the body of statements to which the
statement belongs and/or which is presupposed when the statement is
tested empirically. That body of statements might be a scientific
theory or indeed all of science taken together. Secondly, (Q2) Quine
claims that (Q1) rules out the post-<em>Aufbau</em> non-radical
reductionism he attributes to Carnap.</p>

<p>
Of course, (Q1) is in itself controversial, especially when
confirmational holism is considered to be so global that each instance
of confirmation or disconfirmation of any scientific statement
whatsoever would have to depend on <em>all</em> of our presently
accepted theories in <em>all</em> scientific areas in <em>all</em>
disciplines. (See, e.g., Maddy 2007 and Wilson 2006 for strong
arguments from the practice of science that speak <em>against</em> any
such global holism about confirmation.) But here we will be interested
less in (Q1) and (Q2) than in the question they presuppose: did Carnap
even hold a reductionist view that contradicts confirmational
holism&mdash;did he, in fact, even hold a &ldquo;verification theory
of meaning&rdquo; in which such a reductionist view is implicit?</p>

<p>
Shortly after the <em>Aufbau</em>, influenced both by his discussions
with Neurath in the so-called protocol-sentence-debate (see Uebel
2007) and his engagement with Popper&rsquo;s philosophy of science
(Carus 2007a: Ch. 10), Carnap had come to prefer reconstructions of
science in physicalist languages, which he took to be a better match
with the intersubjective character of scientific claims and testing
procedures than the phenomenalist constitution system that he had
prioritized in the <em>Aufbau</em>.</p>

<p>
Accordingly, in the <em>Logical Syntax</em>, Carnap takes physical law
hypotheses to be tested against protocol sentences &ldquo;by means of
which the results of observation are expressed&rdquo; and which may be
reconstructed within the <em>same physicalist language</em> in which
the law hypotheses themselves are reconstructed. (Though Carnap 1932e
also leaves room for tolerance about the reconstruction of protocol
sentences: compare the supplement on
 <a href="tolerance-metaphysics.html">Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology</a>.)
 The protocol sentences accepted by scientists at a time are not taken
as unrevisable data, but &ldquo;are always being re-examined with the
help of the ever-emerging new protocol-sentences&rdquo; (LSS:
&sect;82). The theoretical terms that are included in scientific
hypotheses are no longer necessarily reconstructed by chains of
definitions but may be merely partially constrained through their
occurrences in physical axioms (&sect;82). The resulting rational
reconstruction in the <em>Logical Syntax</em> of how scientific
theories are tested and justified is a variant of
hypothetico-deductivism in which </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
A sentence of physics&hellip; will be <em>tested</em> by deducing
consequences on the basis of the transformation rules [that is, rules
of inference ] of the language. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When a prediction that is logically derivable in a theory is falsified
by an observation,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
some change must be made in the system. For instance, the P-rules
[physical rules] can be altered in such a way that those particular
primitive sentences [physical axioms] are no longer valid; or the
protocol sentence can be taken as being non-valid; or again the
L-rules [logical rules] which have been used in the deduction can also
be changed&hellip; There is in the strict sense no refutation
(falsification) of an hypothesis; for even when it proves to be
L-incompatible with certain protocol sentences, there always exists
the possibility of maintaining the hypothesis and renouncing
acknowledgment of the protocol-sentences. Still less is there in the
strict sense a complete confirmation (verification) of an
hypothesis&hellip; (LSS: &sect;82)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
When an observation speaks against a theory, in other words, there are
always multiple different rational responses available, including
revising one&rsquo;s physical hypotheses, changing one&rsquo;s logical
system, or rejecting the validity of the observation result. What is
more, the <em>testing</em> of scientific hypotheses is itself a
<em>holistic</em> procedure:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Further, it is, in general, impossible to test even a single
hypothetical sentence. In the case of a single sentence of this kind,
there are in general no suitable L-consequences of the form of
protocol-sentences; hence for the deduction of sentences having the
form of protocol-sentences the remaining hypotheses must also be used.
Thus <em>the test applies, at bottom, not to a single hypothesis but
to the whole system of physics as a system of hypothesis</em> (Duhem,
Poincar&eacute;) (LSS: &sect;82)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is the same confirmational holism that Quine himself adheres to
in his later work (with Carnap&rsquo;s &ldquo;protocol
sentences&rdquo; now called &ldquo;observation sentences&rdquo;). If
Carnap holds any &ldquo;reductionist view&rdquo; in the <em>Logical
Syntax</em> at all, he certainly does not think of it as ruling out
confirmational holism (cf. Friedman 2006).</p>

<p>
More generally, there is every reason to believe that, throughout his
life, Carnap regarded the confirmation and disconfirmation of
scientific hypotheses to be <em>theory-relative</em>: e.g.,
<em>Testability and Meaning</em> (about which more below) defines
confirmation deductively relative to bodies of so-called reduction
sentences that may themselves have empirical content (pp.
443&ndash;445) and be discovered empirically (pp. 454f). While
Carnap&rsquo;s later work on probabilistic confirmation was confined,
for simplicity, to languages without theoretical terms, Carnap did
assume his probability measures to assign the maximal probability of 1
to all those statements of a language that were taken to be analytic
(see, e.g., Carnap 1952b: Section 4, Carnap 1971a, and the supplement
on
 <a href="inductive-logic.html">Inductive Logic</a>),
 and in his mature (non-probabilistic) work on theory reconstruction,
he regarded the question which statements in a reconstruction of a
scientific theory ought to be regarded as analytic as depending on the
theory <em>as a whole</em> (see
 <a href="#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">section 4 on theoretical terms</a>
 below). (In a similar way, modern Bayesian confirmation theory
relativizes subjective probability measures to corpora of background
information.)</p>

<p>
From at latest 1934 (the publication date of the <em>Logical
Syntax</em>, and probably earlier than that), in short, Carnap
rejected Quine&rsquo;s &ldquo;reductionism in its radical form&rdquo;,
and it is very hard to read even Quine&rsquo;s non-radical version of
the reductionist dogma of empiricism into either the <em>Logical
Syntax</em> or Carnap&rsquo;s later work, since Carnap does
<em>not</em> claim empirical statements to be confirmable in isolation
from other statements in a theory or framework.</p>

<p>
Did Carnap ever adhere to a (or &ldquo;the&rdquo;) verification theory
of meaning? In the <em>Aufbau</em>, Carnap does not put forward any
general verificationist thesis about meaning at all: in fact, apart
from his extensionalism (see supplement on
 <a href="semantics.html#CarnExte">Semantics (Section 2)</a>),
 Carnap&rsquo;s views about meaning at that time were close to those
of Frege, and in some parts of the <em>Aufbau</em> he seems to defend
a truth-conditional account of meaning (e.g., &sect;161), even though
he does not distinguish sufficiently clearly between truth conditions
and verification conditions. (In his discussion of the phenomenalist
constitution system of the <em>Aufbau</em>, however, Carnap does get
close to a verificationism about meaning&mdash;see the beginning of
this section.)</p>

<p>
The <em>Logical Syntax</em> tries to steer clear of questions of
meaning altogether or transforms them into syntactical questions (see
the supplement on
 <a href="syntax.html"><em>Logical Syntax of Language</em></a>),
 and before long Carnap would take his semantic turn and regard the
meaning or intension of a sentence as given by its truth conditions
(see the supplement on
 <a href="semantics.html#InteSema">Semantics (Section 1)</a>).
 In &ldquo;Wahrheit und Bew&auml;hrung&rdquo; (1936) Carnap says, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The question of the definition of <em>truth</em> must be clearly
distinguished from the question of a criterion of
<em>confirmation</em>, (1936 [1949: 126], the translation is a a
modification of the original) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
and neither his semantic works (such as <em>Introduction of
Semantics</em>, 1942, or <em>Meaning and Necessity</em>, 1947) nor any
of his later works on inductive logic mention the verification theory
of meaning at all.</p>

<p>
While Carnap does deal with criteria of empirical significance for
theoretical terms and sentences (most importantly in Carnap
1956a&mdash;see Lutz 2012c, 2017 for an overview and assessment),
these criteria were not so much meant as theories of meaning but were
rather supposed to give some guidance on which primitive terms and
syntactic formation rules one ought to use in the (re-)construction of
scientific languages. At the same time, the resulting criteria were
also supposed to help demarcate science from metaphysics; to which we
turn in the supplement on
 <a href="tolerance-metaphysics.html#ToleMeta">Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology (Section 2)</a>.
 (Moreover, these criteria of empirical significance were relativized
to theories and, in this sense, &ldquo;holistic&rdquo; again.)</p>

<p>
The only work which may indeed serve as an obvious target of
Quine&rsquo;s allusion to the verification theory of meaning is
<em>Testability and Meaning</em> (Carnap 1936&ndash;37 [TM1 or TM2]),
which presents a version of the &ldquo;verificationist theory of
meaning&rdquo; in its very first paragraph: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the meaning of a sentence is in a certain sense identical with the way
we determine its truth or falsehood; and a sentence has meaning only
if such a determination is possible. (TM1: 420) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, even that apparent endorsement of the verification theory is
subject to two important qualifications (which might explain
Carnap&rsquo;s own &ldquo;in a certain sense&rdquo; qualification in
this quotation). First, as suggested in the above quotations from the
<em>Logical Syntax</em>, the term &ldquo;determine&rdquo; here should
not be understood as verification proper: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If by verification is meant a definitive and final establishment of
truth, then no (synthetic) sentence is ever verifiable&hellip; We can
only confirm a sentence more and more; (TM1: 420) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
complete verification is not even possible for observation sentences
(TM1: 426, with a reference to Popper). So, verifiability as a
criterion for (synthetic) sentences had already been replaced by
confirmability. Although the Carnap of <em>Testability and
Meaning</em> does not as yet have an opinion on &ldquo;whether the
concept of degree of confirmation can be defined satisfactorily as a
quantitative concept&rdquo; (TM1: 427), this line of reasoning would
ultimately lead to the probabilistic work on numerical confirmation
measures (see supplements on
 <a href="methodology.html#Expl">Methodology (Section 1)</a>,
 and
 <a href="inductive-logic.html">Inductive Logic</a>),
 and which culminated in the modern Bayesian treatment of
confirmation.</p>

<p>
Secondly, and more importantly, <em>Testability and Meaning</em> does
<em>not</em> defend the traditional verifiability requirement for
meaningful sentences that Carnap (TM1: 422) attributes to
Wittgenstein, to earlier publications of the Vienna Circle, and to
views &ldquo;still held by the more conservative wing of this
Circle&rdquo; (that is, Schlick and Waismann, <em>not</em> including
Carnap). Instead, Carnap himself transforms the verifiability
requirement into a <em>proposal</em> about what languages one ought to
speak in science, and how one should rationally reconstruct these
languages. While Carnap acknowledges the availability of
&ldquo;non-empiricist languages&rdquo;, in line with his principle of
tolerance (see the supplement on
 <a href="tolerance-metaphysics.html#ToleLogiSynt">Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology (Section 1)</a>),
 he also <em>recommends</em> that we use languages in which synthetic
statements are considered grammatically well-formed only when they
&mdash;&ldquo;in principle&rdquo;, indirectly, and relative to
theories&mdash;can be confirmed or disconfirmed empirically. (In the
probabilistic terms of his later work, the proposal amounts to
something like this: <em>construct and use languages, probabilistic
confirmation measures, and explications of syntheticity, such that for
every synthetic statement in any such language there is an observation
sentence in the language that confirms or disconfirms the statement
relative to at least one of the confirmation measures</em>.) Hence,
Carnap&rsquo;s &ldquo;verificationism&rdquo; in <em>Testability and
Meaning</em> is not a claim at all, but rather a proposal for how
languages ought to be constructed or reconstructed in order to be
scientifically fruitful.</p>

<p>
Indeed, the whole second part of <em>Testability and Meaning</em> is
devoted to the construction of a sequence of less and less restrictive
&ldquo;empiricist&rdquo; languages corresponding to ever more complex
fragments in the recursion-theoretic hierarchy of languages (differing
in the number of nested alternating universal and existential
quantifiers). This is combined, first, with the proposal to use one of
these languages for the rational reconstruction of empirical science,
and, secondly, with a reconstruction of the methods by which the
sentences of these languages could be confirmed or disconfirmed
empirically. The language that Carnap favors in the end is a full
first-order or even higher-order physicalist language, the first-order
part of which would have been perfectly acceptable even for Quine.
While it is highly questionable whether Carnap thereby succeeded to
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
exclude all sentences of a non-empirical nature, e.g., those of
transcendental metaphysics inasmuch they are not confirmable, not even
incompletely, (TM2: 35) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
as he had hoped originally in <em>Testability and Meaning</em>, the
resulting &ldquo;confirmability proposal&rdquo; for the design of
scientific languages (TM2: 34) in the second part of <em>Testability
and Meaning</em> does <em>not</em> seem affected by any of
Quine&rsquo;s criticisms of &ldquo;non-radical reductionism&rdquo;.
And even Quine would have subscribed to what Carnap calls &ldquo;the
objective of <em>scientific empiricism</em>&rdquo; in the final
paragraph of <em>Testability and Meaning</em>, that is, &ldquo;the
development of an increasingly scientific philosophy&rdquo; (TM2:
38).</p>

<p>
So in contrast to his criticism of the radical reductionism of
Carnap&rsquo;s <em>Aufbau</em>&mdash;which is actually
valid&mdash;Quine&rsquo;s criticism in &ldquo;Two Dogmas&rdquo; of the
supposed non-radical reductionism of Carnap&rsquo;s later work misses
its target.</p>

<h3 id="DispTermTestMean">2. Disposition Terms in <em>Testability and Meaning</em></h3>

<p>
In &sect;7 of <em>Testability and Meaning</em>, Carnap calls attention
to another important class of concepts for which the sole officially
intended method of concept formation in the <em>Aufbau</em>, that is,
<em>definition</em>, turns out to be too restrictive&mdash;disposition
concepts, which cannot be straightforwardly defined on an
observational basis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Suppose, we wish to introduce the predicate &lsquo;\(Q_3\)&rsquo;
meaning &ldquo;soluble in water&rdquo;. Suppose further, that
&lsquo;\(Q_1\)&rsquo; and &lsquo;\(Q_2\)&rsquo; are already defined in
such a way that &lsquo;\(Q_1\)(x, t)&rsquo; means &ldquo;the body
<i>x</i> is placed into water at the time t&rdquo;, and
&lsquo;\(Q_2\)(x, t)&rsquo; means &ldquo;the body <i>x</i> dissolves
at the time t&rdquo;. Then one might perhaps think that we could
define &lsquo;soluble in water&rsquo; in the following way:
&ldquo;<i>x</i> is soluble in water&rdquo; is to mean &ldquo;whenever
<i>x</i> is put into water, <i>x</i> dissolves&rdquo;, in symbols:</p>

\[\tag{D}
  Q_3(x) \equiv (t)[Q_1(x, t) \supset Q_2(x, t)].
  \]

<p>
But this definition would not give the intended meaning of
&lsquo;\(Q_3\)&rsquo;. (TM1: 440)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is easy to see that (D) would not be adequate: e.g., in a case in
which an object is never placed into water at all, the definiens on
the right-hand side would be (vacuously) true, which would entail by
(D) that the object would have to count as water-soluble even when it
is, e.g., made of wood. So (D) is not acceptable.</p>

<p>
In <em>Testability and Meaning</em>, Carnap does not consider the
option of defining disposition terms by means of counterfactual
conditionals that might replace the material conditional in (D),
though in later work he does mention the possibility of defining
disposition terms on the basis of &ldquo;logical and causal
modalities&rdquo; (see Carnap 1956a: 64). Instead, he proposes to
introduce &lsquo;\(Q_3\)&rsquo; by the following sentence in which the
three predicates, the material equivalence symbol
&lsquo;\(\equiv\)&rsquo;, the material conditional
&lsquo;\(\supset\)&rsquo;, and the universal quantifier
&lsquo;(t)&rsquo; change their relative positions (compared to
(D)):</p> 

\[\tag{R}
(x)(t)[Q_1(x, t) \supset (Q_3(x) \equiv Q_2(x, t))],
\]

<p>
in words: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if any thing <i>x</i> is put into water at any time <i>t</i>, then, if
<i>x</i> is soluble in water, <i>x</i> dissolves at the time <i>t</i>,
and if <i>x</i> is not soluble in water, it does not. (TM1: 440f)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast to (D), the new principle (R) seems perfectly acceptable;
it merely says that, given certain test conditions, an object has a
disposition just in case it exhibits a certain response&mdash;which is
exactly what dispositions are all about.</p>

<p>
(R) belongs to the class of sentences called &ldquo;reduction
sentences&rdquo; by Carnap, which he defines in precise syntactic
terms in the first part of <em>Testability and Meaning</em>. Since
explicit definitions, such as (D), constitute a special type of
reduction sentences, the suggestion that scientific terms (in a
reconstruction of a scientific theory) are introduced by reduction
sentences&mdash;which are counted as axioms in the corresponding
framework&mdash;liberalizes the method of concept formation that
Carnap had advocated in the <em>Aufbau</em>. As Carnap says,
&ldquo;previously reducibility was not distinguished from
definability&rdquo; (TM1: 466), but he now considers this a mistake,
since reducibility is strictly more general than definability and does
not have the same general methodological features. In contrast to
definitions, such as (D) above, a reduction sentence such as (R) does
not afford the general <em>eliminability</em> of &ldquo;\(Q_3\)&rdquo;
in favor of &ldquo;\(Q_1\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;\(Q_2\)&rdquo; in every
syntactic context. Moreover, while (D) is <em>conservative</em> over
any background theory that does not as yet include
&ldquo;\(Q_3\)&rdquo;, (R) has proper factual content; it entails
logically that if \(Q_1(x, t)\) and \(Q_2(x, t)\) are the case (and
hence, with (R), also \(Q_3(x)\)), then \(Q_1(x, t') \supset Q_2(x,
t')\) must be true as well, for arbitrary \(t'\). Or in Carnapian
symbols: (R) above logically entails</p> 

\[
(x)(t)[(Q_1(x, t) \amp Q_2(x, t)) \supset  (Q_1(x, t') \supset Q_2(x, t'))],
\]

<p>
which does not include &ldquo;\(Q_3\)&rdquo; syntactically, but which
is derivable once (R) is added to a theory even when the theory had
not included that consequence beforehand. Thus, reduction sentences
such as (R) neither satisfy the eliminability property nor the
non-creativity property of explicit definitions (see Essler 1975 for
more on this).</p>

<p>
Carnap accepts these features of (certain) reduction sentences as
similar in kind to the introduction of a theoretical term <i>T</i> by
scientific laws (p. 443), which in general does not afford the
translation of sentences containing <i>T</i> into sentences containing
only &ldquo;previous&rdquo; terms, particularly observational terms,
either. (Though translatability might perhaps be gained by introducing
theoretical terms by means of indefinite or definite descriptions with
<em>higher-order</em> quantifiers, as explained in
 <a href="#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">section 4</a>
 below). Furthermore&mdash;and again similarly to theoretical terms in
science&mdash;terms introduced by reduction sentences are
<em>indeterminate</em> and <em>open-ended</em>, since arbitrarily many
reduction sentences for one and the same term <i>T</i> may be added to
one&rsquo;s theory in the course of empirical investigations (e.g.,
when new testing or measurement procedures are discovered; see pp.
444&ndash;446). In this way, the meaning of <i>T</i> may be
continually sharpened and its applicability extended. For these
reasons, the rational reconstruction of scientific concept formation
by means of reduction sentences in <em>Testability and Meaning</em>
not only satisfies the exactness requirement for explications but also
goes some way towards satisfying the similarity requirement (see
supplement on
 <a href="methodology.html#Expl">Methodology (Section 1)</a>).
 (Schurz 2009 is a recent example of philosophical work in which
Carnapian reduction sentences are fruitfully applied as rational
reconstructions of empirical indication or measurement laws for
theoretical terms in science.)</p>

<p>
In spite of these attractions, Carnap kept improving his logical
reconstruction of scientific terms. In his later work, disposition
terms are no longer treated as similar to theoretical terms, as in
<em>Testability and Meaning</em>, but occupy an intermediate position
between observational terms and theoretical terms proper; see below,
sections 3 and 4.</p>

<h3 id="ObseTermSentCarnLateWorkRecoScieTheo">3. Observation Terms and Sentences in Carnap&rsquo;s Later Work on the Reconstruction of Scientific Theories</h3>

<p>
It is well known that Carnap distinguished between
<em>observational</em> terms (or &ldquo;elementary&rdquo; terms in
Carnap 1939) and <em>non-observational</em> terms in his
reconstruction of scientific concepts. When <i>V</i> is the
non-logical vocabulary of a formal language <i>L</i> that results from
reconstructing (some fragment of) a scientific language, Carnap
assumes that <i>V</i> can be partitioned into, on the one hand, the
subset \(V_O\) of all observational terms in <i>V</i>, and on the
other hand, <i>V</i> without \(V_O\), that is, the set of
non-observational terms. In a first approximation, the members of
\(V_O\) are meant to express in an ostensive and direct manner some
observable or measurable properties/relations that apply to observable
or measurable objects or events; for instance, terms such as
&ldquo;blue&rdquo;, &ldquo;hot&rdquo;, &ldquo;large&rdquo;, &ldquo;is
warmer than&rdquo;, &ldquo;is (spatially) contiguous to&rdquo; (see
Carnap 1956a: 41), &ldquo;Z&uuml;rich&rdquo;,
&ldquo;heavier-than&rdquo; (Carnap 1958: 237). (Measurement itself is
rational reconstructed in measurement theory, to which Carnap himself
contributed in his &ldquo;Physikalische Begriffsbildung&rdquo; as
early as 1926, by spelling out in precise axiomatic terms necessary
and/or sufficient conditions for the measur<em>ability</em> of
concepts as determined by their scales; see also Carnap 1966, Chapters
5&ndash;9.)</p>

<p>
In line with his principle of tolerance (see the supplement on
 <a href="tolerance-metaphysics.html">Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology</a>),
 Carnap does not think that there is a uniquely determined
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; or &ldquo;natural&rdquo; set of observation
terms: as he had already put it in <em>Testability and Meaning</em>
(in &sect;16 on &ldquo;Sufficient Bases&rdquo;), &ldquo;there can be
several and even mutually exclusive bases&rdquo; for confirmation by
observation. On page 470 of <em>Testability and Meaning</em>, he even
imagines a person who can only distinguish <em>bright</em> from
<em>non-bright</em> and claims that the corresponding predicate
&ldquo;bright&rdquo; and its negation would suffice as a basis for
confirmation&mdash;all other observable or measurable differences
could be &ldquo;coded up&rdquo; technologically and linguistically in
these terms.</p>

<p>
Moreover, Carnap regards &ldquo;observable&rdquo; as a vague term of
ordinary language that requires a <em>decision</em> about where to
draw the exact boundary between it and its negation
&ldquo;non-observable&rdquo; (TM1: 454&ndash;457). Carnap&rsquo;s
mature position goes on to regard the
<em>observable</em>-vs-<em>non-observable</em> dichotomy as spanning a
continuum that may be made precise in different ways for different
purposes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There is no question here of who is using the term
&ldquo;observable&rdquo; in a right or proper way. There is a
continuum which starts with direct sensory observations and proceeds
to enormously complex, indirect methods of observation. Obviously, no
sharp line can be drawn across this continuum; it is a matter of
degree&hellip; the physicist speaks of observables in a very wide
sense compared with the narrow sense of the philosopher, but, in both
cases, the line separating observable from nonobservable is highly
arbitrary. (Carnap 1966: 226)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For instance, to philosophers, &ldquo;observable&rdquo; might apply to
terms such as &ldquo;blue&rdquo;, &ldquo;hard&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;hot&rdquo;, while to physicists it could apply to any term for
&ldquo;any quantitative magnitude that can be measured in a relatively
simple, direct way&rdquo;, such as a temperature of 80 degrees
centigrade, or a weight of 93.5 pounds (Carnap 1966: 225)&mdash;where
what is &ldquo;simple&rdquo; or &ldquo;direct&rdquo; is of course
technology-relative. Accordingly, Carnap regards the distinction
between observable and unobservable <em>entities</em> to be relative
to the relevant methods of observation or measurement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Unobservable entities have a habit of passing over into the observable
realm as more powerful instruments of observation are developed. At
one time, &ldquo;virus&rdquo; was a theoretical term. The same is true
of &ldquo;molecule&rdquo;. Ernst Mach was so opposed to thinking of a
molecule as an existing &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that he once called it a
&ldquo;valueless image&rdquo;. Today, even atoms in a crystal lattice
can be photographed by bombarding them with elementary particles; in a
sense, the atom itself has become an observable (Carnap 1966:
255f).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But in Carnap&rsquo;s view this does not undermine the desirability or
usefulness of the distinction itself, either in science itself or in
the effort to understand science (e.g., in philosophy of science).</p>

<p>
Once it has been decided which of the terms in a linguistic framework
are to be regarded as members of \(V_O\) (for certain purposes and
relative to a certain set of methods of observation or measurement),
these terms are simply taken as &ldquo;given&rdquo; for the purposes
of that reconstruction (perhaps to be reconsidered later). In that
respect, the observation terms in \(V_O\), which Carnap (1966)
sometimes speaks of as &ldquo;<i>O</i>-terms&rdquo;, have a similar
status as David Lewis&rsquo;s &ldquo;<i>O</i>-terms&rdquo; in his
influential &ldquo;How to Define Theoretical Terms&rdquo; (Lewis
1970), which builds directly on Carnap&rsquo;s work, and to which we
return briefly in the following sections. This said, where Lewis
characterizes <i>O</i>-terms as &ldquo;old&rdquo; terms that have been
understood already (maybe only partially and at previous stages of
<em>theoretical</em> inquiry), Carnap assumes the meaning of
observational terms to be determined completely by relatively simple
methods of ostension or measurement (where &ldquo;simple&rdquo; allows
for simple enough involvements of theory so long as the meaning of
observational terms is not left only partially determined).</p>

<p>
With the distinction between observational and non-observational
<em>terms</em> in place, Carnap determines a corresponding set of
observational <em>sentences</em>; this set constitutes a purely
observational language \(L_O\) whose members serve as rational
reconstructions of observation or measurement reports. The intended
domain or universe of discourse of the language \(L_O\), a sublanguage
of the full language <i>L</i>, is a set of observable objects or
events about which the sentences in \(L_O\) make statements. Even with
\(V_O\) being fixed, \(L_O\) may be determined in different ways
depending on how much <em>logical</em> complexity is considered
permissible for an observation or measurement report. The truth value
of a non-trivial <em>universally quantified</em> statement ascribing
observable properties to <em>all</em> observable events at
<em>all</em> places and times, for instance, cannot always be
determined by mere observation or measurement in view of the
unrestricted universal quantifiers involved. So one might not want to
count such a sentence as an observation sentence. And as with \(V_O\)
(see above), there is no uniquely determined &ldquo;correct&rdquo; way
of defining \(L_O\) either; indeed, e.g., Section II of &ldquo;The
Methodological Character of Theoretical Concepts&rdquo; (1956a) merely
enumerates various possible requirements of different kinds and
strengths that might be imposed on \(L_O\). (This corresponds to the
plurality of &ldquo;empiricist languages&rdquo; in <em>Testability and
Meaning</em> that was discussed in
 <a href="#QuinCritCarnReduVeriTheoMean">section 1</a>
 above.) Once \(L_O\) has been defined in exact terms, e.g., a notion
of analyticity for observation sentences can be defined: Carnap (1966:
Chapter 27) suggests doing so, first, by stating metalinguistic
designation rules, which, at least in principle, specify the meaning
of all observational terms completely. Such as: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The term &ldquo;animal&rdquo; designates the conjunction of the
properties (1),&hellip;, (5). The term &ldquo;bird&rdquo; designates
the conjunction of the properties (1),&hellip;, (5), (6),&hellip;.
(Carnap 1966: 261) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Carnaps adds that, for many purposes of reconstruction, it would not
be necessary to list these designation rules in complete
detail&mdash;rather it would be sufficient to specify a list of
salient object-linguistic A-postulates (meaning postulates) that are
merely supposed to constrain the interpretation of the observation
terms in \(V_O\), and whose truth follows logically from the
designation rules. Such as: <em>All birds are animals</em>. (Since
everything that has properties (1),&hellip;, (5), (6),&hellip; must
have properties (1),&hellip;, (5), by logical consequence.) Finally,
an observation sentence in \(L_O\) may be defined as analytic just in
case its truth is logically entailed by the designation rules, or, for
many purposes, just in case the sentence itself is logically entailed
by the set of A-postulates of the underlying linguistic framework.</p>

<h3 id="TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">4. Theoretical Terms and Sentences, and the Logical Structure of Theories</h3>

<p>
While Carnap takes observation terms to be fully interpreted (as
mentioned above; see also, e.g., Section 4 of Carnap 1958)&mdash;they
have determinate extensions and intensions, based on meanings that are
understood more or less in the same manner throughout the relevant
scientific community&mdash;he regards the extensions and intensions of
typical non-observational terms to be only partially determined
(&ldquo;incomplete&rdquo;, &ldquo;open-ended&rdquo;). (In what
follows, we will almost exclusively focus on the <em>extension</em> of
scientific terms. For more on Carnap&rsquo;s general views of
intensions and intensional semantics, see the supplement on
 <a href="semantics.html">Semantics (Section 1)</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
The interpretation of <em>disposition terms</em> (e.g.,
&ldquo;water-soluble&rdquo;) is based on open-ended methods of
operationalization, and <em>theoretical terms</em> (e.g.,
&ldquo;force&rdquo;, &ldquo;field&rdquo;, &ldquo;particles&rdquo;, see
Carnap 1958: 242, or &ldquo;electric potential&rdquo;, &ldquo;wave
function&rdquo;, see Carnap 1939: 62) are interpreted through
theoretical postulates that may not determine extensions or intensions
uniquely. As far as theoretical terms (or &ldquo;abstract terms&rdquo;
in Carnap 1939) are concerned, Carnap builds on David Hilbert&rsquo;s
idea of treating both mathematical terms and theoretical terms in
physics as &ldquo;defined implicitly&rdquo; (in a loose sense of the
term, not in the precise model-theoretic sense of Beth&rsquo;s 1953
definability theorem) by theories considered as axiom systems (see
Chapter 4 of Ben-Menahem 2006 for a summary). As Carnap (1939: 69)
puts it, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is true that a theory must not be a &lsquo;mere calculus&rsquo; but
possess an interpretation, on the basis of which it can be applied to
facts of nature. But it is sufficient&hellip; to make this
interpretation explicit for elementary [observational] terms; the
interpretation of the other terms is then indirectly determined by the
formulas of the calculus, either definitions or laws, connecting them
with the elementary [observational] terms. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Compare also Carnap 1958: 241.)</p>

<p>
In
 <a href="#DispTermTestMean">section 2</a>
 above we sketched Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of disposition terms
in <em>Testability and Meaning</em>, where so-called reduction
sentences served as reconstructions of particularly salient types of
operationalizations. This treatment of disposition terms carries over
to his later work, except that Carnap now distinguishes more sharply
between dispositional and theoretical terms. That is because the
presence of a disposition (e.g., water-solubility) may at least be
<em>disconfirmed</em> directly in a case in which its stimulus or test
condition is satisfied (e.g., an object is put into water) but when
the corresponding response condition is not satisfied (the object does
not dissolve). On the other hand, typical theoretical terms in science
do not allow for similarly simple assignments of stimulus and response
conditions and therefore their application to objects does not allow
for similarly simple methods of disconfirmation (see, e.g., Carnap
1956, Sections IX and X). That is why in &ldquo;The Methodological
Character of Theoretical Concepts&rdquo; Carnap prefers treating
dispositional terms as belonging to an <em>extended observation
language \(L'_O\)</em> that neither coincides with \(L_O\) nor with
the full language <i>L</i>; dispositional terms are no longer regarded
as theoretical terms proper. In the following, we will concentrate
solely on Carnap&rsquo;s mature treatment of theoretical terms, which
are the non-logical members of <i>V</i> that are not members of
\(V_O\) and not disposition terms either; let \(V_T\) be the set of
such theoretical terms in <i>V</i>. (Once again, Carnap regards
&ldquo;observational&rdquo; and &ldquo;theoretical&rdquo; as useful
but vague terms: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
no sharp boundary separates the <i>O</i>-terms from the
<i>T</i>-terms. The choice of an exact dividing line is somewhat
arbitrary. From a practical point of view, however, the distinction is
usually evident, Carnap 1966: 258.) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(For a general survey on theoretical terms in science from the
contemporary point of view, see the entry on
 <a href="../theoretical-terms-science/index.html">theoretical terms in science</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
We start with the reconstruction of theoretical terms and scientific
theories in &ldquo;The Methodological Character of Theoretical
Concepts&rdquo; (1956a). Here Carnap complements the observational
sublanguage \(L_O\) by a purely theoretical counterpart, \(L_T\),
which is a sublanguage of <i>L</i> built solely from logical and
theoretical terms. The intended domain or universe of discourse of
\(L_T\) consists of purely mathematical constructions (sets,
sequences) based upon a given denumerable set of mathematical objects;
if that set of objects is the set of integers, the domain would
include the integers themselves, real numbers (as certain equivalence
classes of countably infinite sequences of integers), tuples of real
numbers, sets of tuples of real numbers, sets of such sets, and so
on&mdash;all mathematical objects included in the hierarchy of
integers, sets of integers, sets of sets of integers, and so forth,
described by simple type theory (which Carnap had also used in his
earlier work; see the supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html"><em>Aufbau</em></a>,
 and also Carnap 1958: 237). Physical, psychological, and social
entities are taken to be <em>representable</em> mathematically in that
domain (e.g., through the spacetime points they occupy which, in turn,
may be represented as tuples of real numbers). A scientific theory
itself is reconstructed as a finite set of postulates in \(L_T\)
(e.g., logical reconstructions of some fundamental laws of theoretical
physics), or, equivalently, as the finite conjunction of such
postulates; call that conjunction: <i>Th</i>.</p>

<p>
The final step of reconstruction consists in the introduction of
so-called correspondence rules which logically relate observation
terms and theoretical terms. (They are Carnap&rsquo;s improved version
of Bridgman&rsquo;s (1927) well-known &ldquo;operational
rules&rdquo;.) Correspondence rules are formulated by means of
expressions in the <em>full</em> language <i>L</i> that includes
<em>both</em> observational terms and theoretical terms; so Carnap
does not count correspondence rules amongst the properly theoretical
postulates of a scientific theory, that is, as belonging to <i>Th</i>.
Correspondence rules may be formulated either as rules of inference or
as statements (correspondence <em>postulates</em>, see 1956a: 47). A
correspondence postulate might, for instance, relate the observational
term &ldquo;heavier than&rdquo; with the theoretical term
&ldquo;mass&rdquo; by means of the expression </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if (observable) physical body <i>u</i> is heavier than (observable)
physical body <i>v</i>, then the mass of the physical object at the
coordinate region \(u*\) corresponding to <i>u</i> is greater than the
mass of the physical object at the coordinate region \(v*\)
corresponding to <i>v</i>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Carnap also allows correspondence rules to involve assignments of
statistical probability, as in the sentence, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if a region has a certain state characterized by theoretical terms
so-and-so, then there is a probability of 0.8 that an event
characterized by observable terms so-and-so occurs. (see 1956a: 49)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Without such correspondence rules, <i>Th</i> would merely be an
uninterpreted calculus, but with them, theoretical terms receive a
partial and indirect &ldquo;epistemic&rdquo; interpretation: they
enable <i>Th</i> to be tested empirically by checking the
observational predictions that can be derived jointly from <i>Th</i>
and the correspondence rules. This includes cases in which one derives
from <i>Th</i> and the correspondence rules the sentence stating that
a certain type of observable event will occur with a certain
statistical probability, which may be confirmed or disconfirmed
inductively based on the observed frequencies of that event type.
(Carnap 1956a regards probabilistic correspondence rules to be
especially important in psychology, as he explains in Section XI which
deals exclusively with the reconstruction of psychological
concepts.)</p>

<p>
In very special and atypical cases, such correspondence rules may
coincide with explicit definitions or reduction sentences (as in
 <a href="#DispTermTestMean">section 2</a>
 above), but usually the logical form of correspondence rules is
different; in particular, normally, theoretical terms <em>cannot</em>
be reduced to observational ones by standard explicit definitions (see
the supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html"><em>Aufbau</em> (Section 3)</a>
 and
 <a href="#DispTermTestMean">section 2</a>
 above) or, more generally, by reduction sentences. (Below we will
describe a proposal contained in Carnap&rsquo;s mature theory
reconstruction according to which theoretical terms <em>can</em>
actually be defined: but with the help of non-standard definitions of
predicates, that is, definitions by higher-order so-called epsilon
terms.)</p>

<p>
Now we turn to Carnap&rsquo;s final treatment of theoretical terms and
theory reconstruction in, first, <em>Philosophical Foundations of
Physics</em> (1966; which is equivalent to that in &ldquo;Observation
Language and Theoretical Language&rdquo;, Carnap 1958), and, secondly,
in &ldquo;Theoretical Concepts in Science&rdquo; (1959a). The basic
setting remains the same, especially the partitioning of terms into
observational and theoretical ones. (For simplicity, we count
dispositional terms as observational terms for now.) <em>Empirical
laws or generalizations</em> (such as laws relating the pressure,
volume, and temperature of gases) are taken to be reconstructable
solely by means of logical and observational terms (so their
reconstructions are members of \(L_O)\), they concern observables,
they can be confirmed or disconfirmed directly by observations, and
&ldquo;they are used for explaining observed facts and for predicting
future observable events&rdquo; (1966: 227). On the other hand, pure
<em>theoretical laws</em> (such as the kinetic theory of gases) are
assumed to be reconstructable using only logical and theoretical terms
(their reconstructions are members of \(L_T)\), and they concern
&ldquo;non-observables&rdquo; (e.g., molecules), that is, entities
that cannot be measured in &ldquo;simple, direct ways&rdquo; (1966:
227). Theoretical laws contribute to the explanation and prediction of
empirical laws and may only be confirmed or disconfirmed indirectly by
confirming or disconfirming the empirical laws they entail in the
presence of correspondence rules (which are members of the full
language <i>L</i> that includes logical, observation, and theoretical
terms, such as, e.g., postulates relating the temperature of a gases
with the mean kinetic energy of its molecules, or the pressure of a
gas with the impact of molecules on the wall of a vessel; see 1966:
241). (Chapters 23&ndash;24 of Carnap 1966 include various further
such examples.)</p>

<p>
But there are also two important changes compared to &ldquo;The
Methodological Character of Theoretical Concepts&rdquo;: a scientific
theory <i>Th</i> as a whole is now reconstructed as the
<em>conjunction</em> of correspondence postulates and theoretical
postulates; and a distinction between the analytic and the synthetic
content of <i>Th</i> is introduced (whereas analyticity had not played
a role in &ldquo;The Methodological Character of Theoretical
Concepts&rdquo;), to the effect that it is not single postulates which
are classified as such but the theory as a whole is divided into an
analytic and a synthetic part. (Carnap argues on 1966: 267f that it is
unclear whether the analytic part of a theory could be determined by
determining for each of its postulates whether it is analytic; e.g.,
if taken independently of correspondence postulates, theoretical laws
are simply uninterpreted; but if taken together with all
correspondence postulates, they may well entail synthetic
sentences.)</p>

<p>
Let the vocabulary in which a scientific theory is reconstructed
consist of logical terms, observation terms, and theoretical terms
again. Let \(\Th = \Th[T_1 ,\ldots ,T_n]\) be our theory reconstructed
as a finitely long conjunction of postulates involving precisely
<i>n</i> theoretical terms \(T_1 ,\ldots ,T_n\) which we take to be
introduced using <i>Th</i>. Other than these theoretical terms,
<i>Th</i> will normally contain various non-theoretical terms as well;
so <i>Th</i> is formulated in the full language <i>L</i>. Intuitively,
then, <i>Th</i> manages to do two things at once&mdash;to say what the
world is like, and to determine the meaning of its theoretical terms
\(T_1 ,\ldots ,T_n\). Carnap&rsquo;s aim is to dissect and reconstruct
these two roles of <i>Th</i>. Following an idea of F.P. Ramsey (1929),
one may, first, replace each theoretical term \(T_i\) by a variable
\(X_i\) of the same type, such that distinct theoretical terms are
replaced by distinct variables that had not been used in <i>Th</i>
before. Secondly, one adds existential quantifiers that bind these new
variables. For example, if \(T_i\) is a predicate expressing a
property of individuals (e.g., being a molecule), then \(X_i\) will be
a predicate variable ranging over properties of individuals which is
bound existentially by a second-order quantifier expression of the
form \(\exists X_i\) (there is a property \(X_i\), such that&hellip;).
None of the observational terms included in <i>Th</i> are affected by
this. In this manner, given \(\Th (= \Th[T_1 ,\ldots ,T_n])\), one
determines the so-called Ramsey sentence of <i>Th</i>, that is,</p>

\[
R(\Th): \exists X_1,\ldots,X_n \Th[X_1 ,\ldots ,X_n]
\]

<p>
which expresses that there are entities (e.g., properties or
relations) \(X_1,\)&hellip;, \(X_n\) for which \(\Th[X_1 ,\ldots
,X_n]\) is the case. (The transition from <i>Th</i> to \(R(\Th)\) is
often called the &ldquo;Ramsification&rdquo; of <i>Th</i>.) Clearly,
\(R(\Th)\) does not involve any theoretical terms anymore, and it is
easy to prove that an observation sentence (which does not include any
theoretical terms) is logically derivable from \(R(\Th)\) just in case
it is logically derivable from <i>Th</i> itself. In this sense,
\(R(\Th)\) captures all of the consequences of <i>Th</i> that can be
expressed without invoking theoretical terms; in particular,
\(R(\Th)\) predicts deductively the same empirical laws as <i>Th</i>
does. Since \(R(\Th)\) involves higher-order quantification, the
logical derivability relation in question must be one of higher-order
logic or, alternatively, derivability in first-order logic and set
theory <em>combined</em>. (For more precise model-theoretic
formulations of the properties of \(R(\Th)\), see van Benthem (1978,
1982, 2012), Ketland (2004, 2009), Dewar (2019).)</p>

<p>
Carnap suggests that the synthetic content of <i>Th</i> is expressed
by its Ramsey sentence \(R(\Th)\).</p>

<p>
But that does not mean that Carnap was in the business of
<em>eliminating</em> theoretical terms, as more traditionally minded,
e.g., Machian empiricists might have advocated. (Nor does Carnap aim
to eliminate &ldquo;theoretical entities&rdquo;; as Hempel 1958
pointed out, \(R(\Th)\) still claims the existence of entities \(X_1
,\ldots ,X_n\), such that \(\Th[X_1,\ldots ,X_n],\) and Carnap was on
board with that, of course.) Indeed, Carnap (1963a,b, 1966)
acknowledges the scientific utility of theoretical terms (see Carnap
1966: 254 and 269) and proposes to identify a theory <i>Th</i>&rsquo;s
analytic content with what is expressed by (what is now called) the
Carnap sentence of <i>Th</i>,</p> 

\[
C(\Th): R(\Th) \rightarrow \Th,
\]

<p>
that is, the material conditional built from the theory&rsquo;s Ramsey
sentence and the theory itself (where <i>Th</i> involves
\(T_1,\)&hellip;,\(T_n,\) as described). The idea behind the Carnap
sentence is that <em>if</em> there are entities \(X_1,\)&hellip;,
\(X_n\) for which \(\Th[X_1,\ldots, X_n]\) is the case, <em>then</em>
one may just as well call &ldquo;them&rdquo; \(T_1,\)&hellip;,\(T_n,\)
respectively. In Carnap&rsquo;s words: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>if</em> the Ramsey sentence is true, we must understand the
theoretical terms in such a way that the entire theory is true.
(Carnap 1966: 270) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If &ldquo;the&rdquo; <i>n</i>-tuple of entities \(\langle X_1 ,\ldots
,X_n\rangle\) satisfying \(\Th[X_1 ,\ldots ,X_n]\) is not determined
uniquely, this might require a &ldquo;choice&rdquo; concerning which
is of the relevant <i>n</i>-tuples is meant to interpret the
theoretical terms \(T_1 ,\ldots ,T_n\): but since Carnap supposes the
only way of determining the meaning of \(T_1 ,\ldots ,T_n\) is by
reference to <i>Th</i>, and since <em>all</em> of the relevant
<i>n</i>-tuples realize \(\Th[X_1 ,\ldots ,X_n]\), it should not
actually matter which <i>n</i>-tuple is &ldquo;chosen&rdquo; (or has
been &ldquo;chosen&rdquo;). Moreover, in whatever way an
<i>n</i>-tuple of entities \(\langle X_1 ,\ldots ,X_n\rangle\)
satisfying \(\Th[X_1 ,\ldots ,X_n]\) is taken to interpret \(T_1
,\ldots ,T_n\) (assuming there is such an <i>n</i>-tuple), the theory
will turn out to be true under that interpretation, and hence the
Carnap sentence as a whole will be true, its truth reflecting the fact
that \(T_1 ,\ldots ,T_n\) have been assigned \(\langle X_1 ,\ldots
,X_n\rangle\), respectively&mdash;which is a semantic state of
affairs, not an empirical one. That is why Carnap takes \(C(\Th)\) to
be analytic (in the language of \(\Th)\): it is the single meaning
postulate or &ldquo;A-postulate&rdquo; that determines the meaning of
all theoretical terms of <i>Th</i> in one fell swoop. Accordingly,
those scientific sentences in <i>L</i> are defined to be analytic
which follow logically from \(C(\Th)\) (possibly augmented
conjunctively by meaning postulates for observation terms; see
 <a href="#ObseTermSentCarnLateWorkRecoScieTheo">section 3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
The following properties of \(\Th\), \(R(\Th)\), and \(C(\Th)\) are
easy to derive: </p>

<dl class="sentag">
<dt>(R1)</dt>
<dd> <i>Th</i> logically entails both \(R(\Th)\) and \(C(\Th)\); in
that sense, \(R(\Th)\) and \(C(\Th)\) are both &ldquo;parts&rdquo; of
<i>Th</i>.</dd>
<dt>(R2)</dt>
<dd> What is more, the conjunction of \(R(\Th)\) and \(C(\Th)\) is
logically equivalent to <i>T</i>, so <i>Th</i> can in fact be
recovered by joining its Ramsey sentence and its Carnap sentence.
</dd>
<dt>(R3)</dt>
<dd> While \(R(\Th)\) logically entails the very same observation
sentences as <i>Th</i>, the Carnap sentence \(C(\Th)\) can be shown
<em>not</em> to entail <em>any</em> observations sentences other than
logically true ones, as one would expect since \(C(\Th)\) is taken to
express <i>Th</i>&rsquo;s analytic content. </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The upshot is: <i>Th</i> is decomposed into a theory part that
corresponds to what the theory says about empirically observable
phenomena (expressed by \(R(\Th)\)) and a theory part that fixes the
meaning of theoretical terms. (Winnie 1970 shows that R1&ndash;R3 do
not determine \(R(\Th)\) and \(C(\Th)\) uniquely, but uniqueness can
be derived by adding a fourth &ldquo;observational vacuity&rdquo;
condition concerning \(C(\Th)\); see also Demopoulos 2007.)</p>

<p>
Schurz (2005) argues that Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of <i>Th</i>
by means of \(R(\Th)\) and \(C(\Th)\) solves several problems of
scientific theory reconstruction, amongst them: to determine the
meaning of theoretical terms \(T_1 ,\ldots ,T_n\) in a non-circular
manner (which is non-trivial since the meaning of \(T_1 ,\ldots ,T_n\)
and the meaning of <i>Th</i> seem to depend on each other) by
interpreting \(T_1 ,\ldots ,T_n\) by any <i>n</i>-tuple \(\langle X_1
,\ldots ,X_n\rangle\) that satisfies \(\Th[X_1 ,\ldots ,X_n]\) if
there is such. And to avoid Kuhnian incommensurability between
theories \(\Th_1\) and \(\Th_2\) that differ in their theoretical
concepts, since, as long as their underlying observation languages are
the same, their respective Ramsey sentences \(R(\Th_1)\) and
\(R(\Th_2)\) will also belong to one and the same language (namely the
observation language extended by higher-order quantifiers), and hence
\(\Th_1\) and \(\Th_2\) will be mutually understandable and assessable
by their Ramsey sentences being mutually understandable and
assessable. On the other hand, Schurz (2005) also points out that
\(C(\Th)\) does not <em>define</em> \(T_1 ,\ldots ,T_n\) in the sense
of an explicit definition, nor does the distinction between \(R(\Th)\)
and \(C(\Th)\) explain how the meaning of complex sentences involving
\(T_1,\)&hellip;, \(T_n\) can be determined <em>compositionally</em>
from the meaning of their syntactic components. (The lack of
compositionality in Ramsification had previously been criticized by
Glymour 1980.)</p>

<p>
Carnap (1959a) may be understood as developing a response to the last
two worries by suggesting theoretical terms to be <em>definable</em>
with the help of <em>higher-order indefinite descriptions</em>. (He
took his previous work to show that theoretical terms were not
<em>first</em>-order definable from observation terms, as discussed in
the supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html#ReceLateDiscAufb"><em>Aufbau</em> (Section 3)</a>
 and
 <a href="#DispTermTestMean">section 2</a>
 above.) For simplicity, let us focus just on one theoretical term
<i>T</i> introduced by \(\Th[T]\): the proposal is to regard <i>T</i>
to be definable explicitly by</p> 

\[T = eX\Th[X]\]

<p>
where <i>e</i> is the so-called epsilon operator and \(eX\Th[X]\) is a
so-called epsilon term. The epsilon operator had been introduced by
David Hilbert in the context of arithmetical theories and was employed
later by Bourbaki in foundational work in mathematics. In words:
<i>T</i> is defined to be <em>an <i>X</i></em> such that \(\Th[X].\)
So <i>e</i> resembles the better known iota operator <i>i</i> that is
used in definite descriptions, except that the definite
&ldquo;<em>the</em>&rdquo; gets replaced by the indefinite
&ldquo;<em>an</em>&rdquo;. Russell&rsquo;s well-known paper (1905) had
suggested the contextual elimination of definite descriptions in terms
of quantified statements. <em>In</em>definite descriptions, that is,
epsilon terms, do not necessarily need to be explained away
contextually in favor of quantifiers; in fact, quantified expressions
may in turn be regarded as abbreviations of expressions involving
<i>e</i>: e.g., &lsquo;\(\exists XA[Xk]\)&rsquo; may be considered as
a metalinguistic abbreviation of \(A[eXA[X]].\) <i>e</i> itself may be
understood as a primitive logical expression governed by new logical
and semantic rules. On the logical side, the corresponding system is
called the &ldquo;epsilon calculus&rdquo; in which&mdash;if applied to
higher-order epsilon terms, such as \(eX\Th[X]\)&mdash;the sentence
\(\exists X\Th[X] \rightarrow \Th[eX\Th[X]]\) is provable
<em>logically</em> (see entry on
 <a href="../theoretical-terms-science/index.html">theoretical terms in science</a>
 for details). This means that the Carnap sentence \(C(\Th)\) results
from replacing <i>T</i> by its definiens \(eX\Th[X]\) in the logical
law \(\exists X\Th[X] \rightarrow \Th[eX\Th[X]]\); hence \(C(\Th)\) is
a definitional truth. On the semantic side, the standard semantics for
epsilon terms (see Leisenring 1969) interprets <i>e</i> by means of a
choice function that maps each non-empty set of entities of the
appropriate type to one of its members (e.g., a non-empty set of sets
to one of its members). In this way, the intuitive gloss of a
theoretical term <i>T</i> &ldquo;choosing&rdquo; an object <i>X</i>
that satisfies \(\Th[X]\) (if there is such) receives a precise
model-theoretic rendering. (Carnap 1961b also proposes a
reconstruction of set theory with the help of epsilon terms in which,
e.g., the set-theoretic axiom of choice becomes a logical principle.)
The indeterminacy concerning the question which object <i>X</i> is
chosen (if more than one <i>X</i> satisfies \(\Th[X]\)) shows up in
the <em>plurality</em> of choice functions that are available
model-theoretically and the <em>arbitrariness</em> which of them
interprets the epsilon operator; indeed, one may think of
&ldquo;the&rdquo; choice function that interprets epsilon terms to be
left indeterminate. If \(eX\Th[X]\) is assigned a semantic value by a
choice function, the semantic value of any complex expression
\(A[eX\Th[X]]\) that includes \(eX\Th[X]\) can be determined
compositionally in the usual manner, addressing the compositionality
problem mentioned above. (See Andreas and Schiemer 2016 for a recent
choice-theoretic reconstruction of theoretical truth in science that
builds on Carnap&rsquo;s account.)</p>

<p>
Not much later, David Lewis (1970) proposed a similar treatment of
theoretical terms, according to which theoretical terms are defined by
means of <em>definite</em> descriptions. Lewis himself preferred
first-order \(T = ix\ldots\) versions of such definitions and assumes
(reifications of) second-order entities, such as properties and
relations, to be members of the first-order universe of discourse. But
the corresponding second-order version, which is closer to
Carnap&rsquo;s own approach, would look like this:</p> 

\[
T = iX \Th[X].
\]

<p>
Clearly, as Lewis (1970: 427) points out himself, his proposal is
&ldquo;in the spirit of Ramsey&rsquo;s and Carnap&rsquo;s&rdquo;
proposals, the only difference being that typical scientific theories
are assumed to determine <em>uniquely</em> the meaning of the
theoretical terms they introduce. (Lewis gave up on this general
unique definability assumption in his later work.) As mentioned in the
supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html#StruAufb"><em>Aufbau</em> (Section 2)</a>,
 the early Carnap had considered the same method of defining concepts
by definite description in &sect;&sect;153&ndash;155 of his
<em>Aufbau</em>, when he contemplated defining the basic predicate
<i>Er</i> of his phenomenalist constitution system (see supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html#StruAufb"><em>Aufbau</em> (Section 2)</a>)
 as <em>the</em> binary relation satisfying a particular condition
that was stated in the language of the constitution system. (But
Carnap, unlike Lewis, used a higher-order definite description.)</p>

<p>
An application of Lewis&rsquo;s method in philosophy is the so-called
&ldquo;Canberra plan&rdquo;, which takes philosophy to proceed by
conceptual analysis along the lines of Ramsey-Carnap-Lewis method, and
was put forward by David Lewis, Frank Jackson (see Jackson 1998), and
others. It clearly owes much to Carnap&rsquo;s work on theoretical
terms in science. Recently, Chalmers (2012) has developed a
&ldquo;close relative of the Canberra plan&rdquo; (2012: 362) which
even revives some aspects of Carnap&rsquo;s methodology of the
<em>Aufbau</em> (but which, unlike Canberra planners and the
<em>Aufbau</em>, does not aim at the construction of a system of
definitions). But there are also some important differences: Canberra
planners use the Ramsey-Carnap-Lewis method for mere conceptual
analysis (Jackson 1998), not for rational reconstruction (although the
differences are fluid). Secondly, some Canberra planners invoke
expressions such as &ldquo;natural&rdquo; or &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo;
as primitive O-terms by which properties and relations can be
qualified, which, for Carnap, would require rational reconstruction,
and the reconstruction of which would be likely to be
framework-relative; the same holds for nomic expressions such as
&ldquo;law&rdquo; (in the metaphysical sense of the term), which
Chalmers (2012) regards as primitive. Finally, both the Canberra
planners and Chalmers take a priori justification and the
corresponding notion of aprioricity to be of central importance in
philosophy, and at least some of them (e.g., Chalmers) assume
aprioricity to extend beyond analyticity or the purely conceptual;
while for Carnap <em>relativized</em> notions of aprioricity in the
sense of analyticity-in-a-framework are central (see supplement on
 <a href="carnap-quine.html">Carnap versus Quine on the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction</a>)
 and all synthetic <em>a priori</em> justification is rejected.</p>

<h3 id="Crit">5. Criticism</h3>

<p>
Carnap&rsquo;s rational reconstruction of scientific language and
theories was enormously influential within 20th century philosophy of
science and constitutes one pillar of what is sometimes referred to as
the &ldquo;received view&rdquo; of scientific theories (together with
the subsequent work of Hempel, Feigl, Nagel, and others). As such, it
also attracted heavy criticism from various directions.</p>

<p>
On the one hand, there is general criticism of logical empiricist
philosophy of science to the effect that its logical methods were
found to be overly restrictive, it was said to be focused too much on
physics and mathematics, and that even in these two areas it had
become increasingly removed from the actual practice of science
(whereas its initial stages had been closely informed by
state-of-the-art developments, such as relativity theory and set
theory). While these general criticisms apply to Carnap&rsquo;s
philosophy of science, too, we will not discuss them here in further
detail.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, there is also criticism more specifically of
Carnap&rsquo;s philosophy of science, to some of which we now turn.
(Other critical points we have discussed above (see
 <a href="#QuinCritCarnReduVeriTheoMean">section 1</a>
 and elsewhere; see supplement on
 <a href="carnap-quine.html">Carnap versus Quine on the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
First, the distinction between observational and theoretical terms
came under attack (see, e.g., Putnam 1962, van Fraassen 1980), because
<em>all</em> terms in a scientific theory might turn out to be
<em>theory-laden</em>, and all of them may potentially apply
<em>both</em> to observable and unobservable objects. Since Carnap
does acknowledge the distinction to be vague and purpose-relative, as
explained in sections 3 and 4, this seems like a minor point of
criticism (so long as the decisions concerning the
observational-theoretical distinction still turn out to pay off in
theory reconstructions). Where necessary, Carnap might have taken
Lewis&rsquo;s later step from observational terms to &ldquo;old
terms&rdquo; (recall
 <a href="#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">section 4</a>
 above) or invoked the later Kripke-Putnam line on externalism about
meaning to argue that the meaning of observational terms, which in any
case are often simply terms from natural language, is referential and
therefore depends on environmental and social factors but not so much
on theories. All of that would have been compatible with
Carnap&rsquo;s main semantic point that observation terms may be
reconstructed to be fully interpreted in a Tarskian fashion whereas
the interpretation of theoretical terms after reconstruction is
partial and open-ended.</p>

<p>
A second, more pertinent criticism concerns Carnap&rsquo;s
presupposition that scientific theories can be reconstructed
<em>deductively</em> in a formal <em>language</em>. The so-called
structuralist or non-statement view of theories (as developed by
authors such as Suppes, Suppe, Sneed, van Fraassen, Balzer, Moulines,
and others; see entry on
 <a href="../physics-structuralism/index.html">structuralism in physics</a>
 for a survey) reconstructs theories instead as sets of
<em>mathematical structures or models</em>. While Carnap had used
model-theoretic methods in his early logical work in the 1920s even
prior to his engagement with G&ouml;del and Tarski (in particular, in
his unpublished &ldquo;Untersuchungen zur allgemeinen Axiomatik&rdquo;
from 1928, and in his logic textbook <em>Abri&szlig; der Logistik</em>
from 1929, see Awodey &amp; Carus 2001; Schiemer 2013; Schiemer et al.
2017), model theory only became prominent in Carnap&rsquo;s work in
his publications in semantics since the late 1930s (details in the
supplement on
 <a href="semantics.html">Semantics</a>).
 It took a while for Carnap&rsquo;s model-theoretic reconstructions of
language and logic to diffuse into his work in the philosophy of
science, but there are clear indications that this is the path he
would have followed, if his life had continued into the 1970s. In
&ldquo;The Methodological Character of Theoretical Concepts&rdquo;,
Carnap had already characterized observation terms and theoretical
terms by describing their syntactic <em>and</em> semantic features
(&ldquo;the values of the variables must be&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;no
model contains more than&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;the domain <i>D</i> of
entities&hellip; includes a denumerable subdomain&hellip;&rdquo;, see
Carnap 1956a: 41 and p. 43). Similarly, in his work in inductive logic
from the early 1960s, he no longer took probabilities of
<em>sentences</em> as his starting point but rather probabilities of
<em>sets of models</em>. As he says in his (posthumously published)
<em>Basic System of Inductive Logic. Part 1</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In our present system, we prefer to speak, not of <em>signs</em> of
the language but instead of the corresponding <em>entities</em>,
especially individuals and attributes. Therefore, we take as
representatives of the possible cases with respect to a given
language&hellip; <strong>models</strong> [Carnap&rsquo;s emphasis], as
is customary today in the (semantical) theory of logical
language-systems and axiom systems. (Carnap 1971a: 54)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(See Sznajder 2016 for further discussion.) So we can safely
hypothesize that Carnap would have gone along with central features of
the non-statement view of scientific theories, except that he would
have preferred to <em>combine</em> syntactic or proof-theoretic
methods of theory reconstruction with model-theoretic ones, as is
customary in logic. (The preferability of such combined accounts in
the philosophy of science has recently been urged again by Lutz 2014
and Andreas 2013, 2014.)</p>

<p>
Van Fraassen (1980: 54f) raised the additional worry that the
sentences in the observational sublanguage \(L_O\) which follow
logically from a theory <i>Th</i> do not capture precisely what
<i>Th</i> says about observable objects; e.g., some of these sentences
may claim the existence of <em>unobservable</em> entities
<em>lacking</em> certain observable properties (&ldquo;there exists
something that is not blue and not hot and not hard
and&hellip;&rdquo;), even though they are members of \(L_O\) (no
theoretical terms are involved). Since philosophy of science in
general, and van Fraassen&rsquo;s program of constructive empiricism
in particular, require a notion of empirical adequacy, it would indeed
cast doubt on the so-called syntactic view of theories if empirical
adequacy, therefore, could not be reconstructed in syntactic
terms.</p>

<p>
From the viewpoint of Carnap&rsquo;s mature reconstruction of
scientific theories, however, there is a response (given informally by
Friedman 2011) to this worry which can be made precise along the
following lines (building on the formalization of Ketland 2004):
Consider a formal language <i>L</i> to be given, including observation
terms and theoretical terms, as described by Carnap. We fix the
intended &ldquo;actual&rdquo; model so that the first-order domain of
individuals includes a set of observable objects, so that observation
terms apply solely to such observable objects, and so that all
higher-order quantifiers range over all sets over the first-order
domain that are of the appropriate set-theoretic type. In addition,
the intended model may also contain unobservable objects, and it
assigns interpretations to all theoretical terms. The theory
<i>Th</i>, which is a finite conjunction of sentences in <i>L</i>, may
be taken to correspond on the model-theoretic side to the class of
models that satisfy <i>Th</i>. With these assumptions in place (which
are not implausible from the model-theoretic viewpoint), one can show
that the Ramsey sentence \(R(\Th)\) expresses in the object language
(up to a cardinality constraint) what in model-theoretic terms is
often meant when one calls a set of models, that is, a theory in the
model-theoretic sense, empirically adequate: one of its models
containing an &ldquo;empirical&rdquo; submodel (which comprises a
subset of the domain and all interpretations of the members of the
observational vocabulary on that domain) that is isomorphic to the
submodel of the intended &ldquo;actual&rdquo; model that comprises the
observable objects taken together with the observational properties
and relations (which are again expressed by observation terms). See
Theorem 6 of Ketland (2004) for a precise formal statement of this
result. More briefly: \(R(\Th)\) is true in the intended model just in
case the set of models corresponding to <i>Th</i> is empirically
adequate (and also a certain cardinality constraint concerning
non-observable objects is satisfied, which we will not explain in
further detail here).</p>

<p>
One should add that this model-theoretic notion of empirical adequacy
is just a <em>simplification</em> of what van Fraassen (1980: Chapters
2&ndash;3) himself means by a set of models &ldquo;saving the
phenomena&rdquo; or being empirically adequate. For van Fraassen
considers <em>multiple</em> models determined by experiments and
measurements on observable objects&mdash;each such model being an
&ldquo;appearance&rdquo;&mdash;and calls a set of models empirically
adequate just in case it includes a model <i>M</i>, such that
<em>every</em> appearance is isomorphic to at least one empirical
submodel of <i>M</i> (see Lutz 2012c: Section 4.2.1 for a precise
statement). But the result for the simpler version of empirical
adequacy should still be sufficient to show that at least one
plausible model-theoretic account of the empirical adequacy of a
theory can be expressed (up to a cardinality constraint) in terms of
the truth of its Ramsey sentence. The deeper underlying point is that
there is not much of a difference between a syntactic reconstruction
of empirical content by means of a Ramsey sentence <em>with a
higher-order existential quantifier</em> ( as in &ldquo;there is a set
<i>D</i> and a relation <i>R</i> on <i>D</i>, such
that&hellip;&rdquo;) and a <em>model-theoretic existence
statement</em> (as in &ldquo;there is a model with a domain <i>D</i>
and a relation <i>R</i> on <i>D</i>, such that&hellip;&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
While this addresses van Fraassen&rsquo;s worry, it points to yet
another potential problem for Carnap&rsquo;s account: if the Ramsey
sentence of a theory <i>Th</i> expresses its empirical adequacy (up to
the cardinality constraint), and if the Carnap sentence of <i>Th</i>
is analytic in the language of <i>Th</i> (recall
 <a href="#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">section 4</a>,
 then where exactly has the &ldquo;surplus content&rdquo; gone by
which, supposedly, the truth of <i>Th</i> exceeds its empirical
adequacy and its conceptual presuppositions (assuming a realist
semantics and metasemantics, that is, realist answers to the questions
of what means what, and in virtue of what do these meaning relations
hold)? We postpone a discussion of this point to
 <a href="#StruCarnMatuTheoReco">section 6</a>
 below, where we address what might be called Carnap&rsquo;s
conceptual (or linguistic or semantic) structuralism.</p>

<p>
A third type of criticism questions Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of
theories on <em>inductive</em> grounds. As Hempel demonstrates in
&ldquo;The Theoretician&rsquo;s Dilemma&rdquo; (Hempel 1958),
theoretical principles in scientific theories do not just have the
function of supporting deductive inferences but also allow for
<em>inductive</em> systematizations: the assumption of certain
theoretical principles may make certain observations likely, or more
likely, given certain other observations&mdash;a feature of
theoretical principles which may be exploited in inductive predictions
and explanations. Hempel argues that typical empiricist
reconstructions of theories do not manage to preserve these
theories&rsquo; powers of inductive systematization and hence fail to
capture some of their most important aspects.</p>

<p>
This kind of argument was worked out in more detail later (Scheffler
1963, 1968; Niiniluoto 1972; Tuomela 1974; Raatikainen 2012),
especially with respect to the Ramsification of scientific theories.
For illustrative purposes, we follow a part of that literature in
using Scheffler&rsquo;s following simple example (though, as we will
see below, the example actually turns out to be <em>too</em> simple):
Consider two unary observation predicates \(O_1\) and \(O_2\), a unary
theoretical predicate <i>T</i>, and an individual constant <i>a</i>.
Here is a simple instance of a (toy) theory:</p> 

\[
\Th: \forall x((T(x) \rightarrow  O_1 (x)) \land  ((T(x) \rightarrow  O_2 (x)))
\]

<p>
<i>Th</i> says that all <i>T</i>-objects are \(O_1\)-objects and all
<i>T</i>-objects are \(O_2\)-objects. The Ramsey sentence of <i>Th</i>
is:</p> 

\[
R[\Th]: \exists X \forall x((X(x) \rightarrow  O_1 (x)) \land  ((X(x) \rightarrow  O_2 (x)))
\]

<p>
Similarly, let us also look at yet another simple theory and its
Ramsey sentence:</p> 

\[
\Th': \forall x((T(x) \rightarrow  O_1 (x)) \land  ((T(x) \rightarrow  \neg{O_2 (x)}))
\]

<p>
\(\Th'\) expresses that all <i>T</i>-objects are \(O_1\)-objects, and
all <i>T</i>-objects are <em>not</em> \(O_2\)-objects. Its Ramsey
sentence is:</p> 

\[
R[\Th']: \exists X\forall x((X(x) \rightarrow  O_1 (x)) \land  ((X(x) \rightarrow  \neg O_2 (x)))
\]

<p>
It is plausible to believe that <i>Th</i> achieves inductive
systematization between \(O_1 (a)\) and \(O_2 (a)\), in the sense
that, on the assumption of <i>Th</i>, observing that \(O_1 (a)\) is
the case should make it likely, or at least more likely, that \(O_2
(a)\) is the case. For analogous reasons, it is plausible that
\(\Th'\) achieves inductive systematization between \(O_1 (a)\) and
\neg \(O_2 (a)\). If Ramsification preserved inductive
systematization, then \(R[\Th]\) would have to support the same
patterns of inductive systematization as <i>Th</i>, and similarly for
\(R[\Th']\) and \(\Th'\). But that does not seem to be the case, as
\(R[\Th]\) and \(R[\Th']\) are both <em>logically true</em> in
second-order logic (in every model the empty set <i>X</i> may serve as
witness of a set that is a subset of the set of \(O_1\)-objects, the
set of \(O_2\)-objects, and the set of \neg (\(O_2\))-objects). How
could a logical truth achieve any kind of inductive systematization?
Moreover: how should \(R[\Th]\) achieve inductive systematization
between \(O_1 (a)\) and \(O_2 (a)\), and \(R[\Th']\) between \(O_1
(a)\) and \neg (\(O_2 (a)\), when \(R[\Th]\) and \(R[\Th']\) are
logically equivalent (as follows from their logical truth)? Hence,
Ramsification does not always seem to preserve inductive
systematization, which is why, at least in certain cases, something
seems to be lost in the step from a theory to its Ramsey sentence.</p>

<p>
Carnap himself did not reply to this kind of objection in any detail
(although, as he said in an interview from 1964, he regarded the topic
of inductive probability for theoretical sentences as a promising
future research topic). But since he agreed with Hempel&rsquo;s
original point without being worried by it, he clearly thought the
criticism would not affect his own account. Here is how a reply on
Carnap&rsquo;s behalf might look. First, it would point out that
Carnap&rsquo;s aim was not to <em>replace</em> a theory by its Ramsey
sentence; his aim was to <em>reconstruct</em> a theory, and to do so
<em>jointly</em> by its Ramsey sentences <em>and</em> its Carnap
sentence, without any intention of eliminating theoretical terms. If
we combine Carnap&rsquo;s mature reconstruction of theories with his
probabilistic reconstruction of confirmation (see the supplement on
 <a href="inductive-logic.html">Inductive Logic</a>),
 a task Carnap himself did not undertake, one would end up with a
picture like this: consider a (logical or subjective) probability
measure <i>P</i> defined on a language that includes both the language
of a theory <i>Th</i> and higher-order quantifiers, such that <i>P</i>
represents the ideal degrees of belief of a scientist whose scientific
presuppositions are reconstructed by the underlying framework of
<i>Th</i>. Analytic statements, such as \(C[\Th]\), must receive
probability 1, since they cannot be revised by updating
(conditionalization) on new empirical evidence but only by taking the
more radical step of revising the underlying linguistic framework.
(Compare also the final part of the supplement on
 <a href="carnap-quine.html">Carnap versus Quine on the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction</a>;
 Carnap (1963, p. 989) states explicitly that the Carnap sentence
should receive probability 1 in virtue of being an
&ldquo;A-postulate&rdquo;.) But when \(P(C[\Th]) = 1\), it follows
from the axioms of probability that \(P(\Th \leftrightarrow R[\Th]) =
1\), and thus also \(P(\Th) = P(R[\Th])\) and \(P(B \mid \Th \land A)
= P(B \mid R[\Th] \land A)\), which means that <i>Th</i> and
\(R[\Th]\) are in fact indistinguishable with regard to inductive
systematizations. (E.g., if \(P(B \mid \Th \land A)\) is high, \(P(B
\mid R[\Th] \land A)\) is high as well; if \(P(B \mid \Th \land A)\)
is greater than \(P(B \mid \Th)\), then \(P(B \mid R[\Th] \land A)\)
is greater than \(P(B \mid R[\Th])\), too; and so on.) Given
Carnap&rsquo;s account of theoretical terms being introduced by the
analytic Carnap sentence, therefore, it holds that the Ramsey sentence
of a theory achieves inductive systematization just in case the theory
does so itself.</p>

<p>
While this seems a plausible enough reply, it also shows that, at
least from a Carnapian point of view, Scheffler&rsquo;s simple theory
<i>Th</i> in the example above is not actually a plausible example to
begin with; as mentioned before, \(R[\Th]\) is actually logically true
in that case, which is why \(C[\Th]\) is logically equivalent to
<i>Th</i>, and since \(C[\Th]\) is analytic, the same must hold for
<i>Th</i>. Raatikainen (2011) turns this into a criticism of
Carnap&rsquo;s account on the grounds that, intuitively, <i>Th</i>
should be empirically disconfirmable, but that this could not be the
case if <i>Th</i> is analytic; so something must have gone wrong with
Carnap&rsquo;s take on theoretical terms. What is really at issue
here, though, is whether the meaning of <i>T</i> is <em>determined
by</em> <i>Th</i> or not: when Raatikainen thinks that <i>Th</i> could
be empirically disconfirmed, he assumes that <i>T</i> has been
assigned an interpretation <em>prior to</em> or <em>independently
of</em> the role that <i>T</i> plays within <i>Th</i>; relative to any
such assignment, it may well be that <i>Th</i> is a non-trivial
statement which may be empirically disconfirmed. But then a Carnapian
reconstruction of the theoretical term <i>T</i> would not have to
proceed by determining the Ramsey sentence and the Carnap sentence of
<i>Th</i> but of the very theory, say, \(\Th^*\), by which that prior
interpretation of <i>T</i> was determined. (For the same reason, if
one wanted to present <i>Th</i> in a Ramsey-sentence style format, it
would rather correspond to a claim of the form \(\exists X(\Th^* [X]
\land \Th[X])\), which might indeed be disconfirmable.) On the other
hand, if the meaning of <i>T</i> is actually fixed by
Scheffler&rsquo;s example theory <i>Th</i>, then it no longer sounds
implausible that the extension of <i>T</i> will have only been
constrained to coincide with <em>any</em> set that is both a subset of
the set of \(O_1\)-objects and the set of \(O_2\)-objects; in which
case the existence of such a set will indeed be guaranteed on logical
grounds (the empty set is always a possible candidate), and <i>Th</i>
should indeed count as analytic, as suggested by Carnap. In that case,
however, it would be unlikely that scientists would ever put forward a
theory such as <i>Th</i>, so Scheffler&rsquo;s example seems
unsuitable even as a toy example.</p>

<p>
We address the general plausibility of Carnap&rsquo;s account of
theoretical terms from a realist point of view in the following
section.</p>

<h3 id="StruCarnMatuTheoReco">6. Structuralism in Carnap&rsquo;s Mature Theory Reconstructions</h3>

<p>
In one sense of the term, &ldquo;structuralism&rdquo; is sometimes
used as another label for the non-statement view about scientific
theories, discussed in
 <a href="#Crit">section 5</a>
 above. As pointed out, Carnap&rsquo;s late work involves
model-theoretic reconstructions of theories and hence is structuralist
in that sense. Some structuralists about theories, in turn, adopt
certain components of their theory reconstructions from Carnap, such
as the reconstruction of the synthetic content of theories by means of
a Ramsey sentence: e.g., Sneed (1971) and Balzer et al. (1986) define
the so-called empirical claim of a theory by Ramsifying the
theory&rsquo;s theoretical terms &ldquo;across&rdquo; its intended
applications. But they usually present this aspect of their work as
building directly on Ramsey rather than Carnap, and they do not employ
Carnap&rsquo;s original contributions in this area, such as the Carnap
sentence. (However, Andreas 2014 develops an explicitly Carnapian
&ldquo;structuralism&rdquo; in the same model-theoretic
tradition.)</p>

<p>
More recently, &ldquo;structural realism&rdquo; (Worrall 1989; see
also entry on
 <a href="../structural-realism/index.html">structural realism</a>)
 is the name given to a family of views in general philosophy of
science meant to occupy a natural position between traditional forms
of realism and antirealism about scientific progress: the thought they
have in common is that typical changes from one empirically successful
scientific theory to another preserve the structural or mathematical
content of the former (abandoned) theories or of some of their theory
parts. Accordingly, when putting forward a scientific theory, one
should not commit oneself epistemically, over and above its empirical
content, to more than just its <em>structural or mathematical
content</em>. Ladyman (1998) helpfully distinguishes between
<em>epistemic</em> and <em>ontic</em> versions of structural realism:
while ontic structural realist positions hold that the world itself
consists of structures that differ ontologically from
&ldquo;substances&rdquo; in the traditional metaphysical sense,
epistemic structural realist views remain silent about the &ldquo;true
nature&rdquo; of the unobservable entities posited by our theories and
claim instead that, whatever these unobservable entities might be, we
are only able to know their structural features.</p>

<p>
We will argue that Carnap articulated a <em>conceptual</em> (or
<em>linguistic</em> or <em>semantic</em>) structuralism about science
that differs both from ontic and from epistemic structural realism;
instead of claiming that the <em>world</em> consists of structures or
that we are only ever able to <em>know</em> the structure of the
world, Carnap holds that the <em>propositional content</em> of our
scientific theories is structural with respect to their theoretical
(rather than observational) components. Carnap&rsquo;s structuralism
is metaphysically neutral with respect to the nature of unobservable
individuals and theoretical higher-order entities, it may be viewed as
only entailing a version of epistemic structural realism (without
coinciding with it), and it resembles certain recent proposals of
structuralism about mathematics, especially that of Awodey (1996,
2004). The burden of Carnap&rsquo;s structuralism is that, first,
<em>the cognitive content of whatever can be asserted precisely and
meaningfully in science at all can be reconstructed as a combination
of empirical content and structural content</em>; and secondly, that
<em>one should aim at such empirical-structural reconstructions as
they enhance the clarity and objectivity of one&rsquo;s scientific
assertions</em>. In the following, we will explain this in more
detail. (Stein (1989) develops a similarly metaphysically neutral
understanding of science that shares various characteristic features
with Carnap&rsquo;s, as Stein himself points out. For another
structuralist interpretation of Carnap on theoretical terms, see
Friedman 2011; our discussion will be compatible with Friedman&rsquo;s
but also go beyond it. Ivanova (2011) discusses how the relation
between Friedman&rsquo;s conception of the relativized a
priori&mdash;which interprets Carnap&rsquo;s notion of analyticity in
methodological terms, as described at the end of the supplement on
 <a href="carnap-quine.html">Carnap versus Quine on the Analytic-Synthetic Distinction</a>&mdash;and
 structural realism, and also addresses the question whether the two
are even compatible.)</p>

<p>
As for many other structuralists, logical concepts (such as
quantifiers) constitute Carnap&rsquo;s main device by which structural
features are determined and described. The reason why logical concepts
are suitable for that purpose lies in their general invariance
properties: as Awodey (2017: 68) points out, Carnap&rsquo;s essential
idea about logicality in the <em>Logical Syntax</em> had been that
&ldquo;the logical terms&mdash;including the logical
sentences&mdash;are invariant under reinterpretation of the empirical
terms&rdquo; (see the supplement on
 <a href="syntax.html"><em>Logical Syntax of Language</em></a>).
 In fact, in an earlier unpublished note from 1927 (&ldquo;Beweis der
Unm&ouml;glichkeit einer Gabelung der Arithmetik&rdquo;, Carnap 1927),
Carnap had already proven the logical operations of simple type theory
to be invariant under isomorphisms (one-to-one and onto
structure-preserving mappings), anticipating Tarski&rsquo;s (1986)
famous later model-theoretic characterization of logical concepts.
Carnap&rsquo;s note is part of his larger &ldquo;Untersuchungen zur
allgemeinen Axiomatik&rdquo; project that he worked on from
1927&ndash;9 (Carnap 1928b) which aimed to prove the so-called
&ldquo;<em>Gabelbarkeitssatz</em>&rdquo;, that is, the equivalence
between the semantic completeness of a theory and its categoricity,
i.e., the theory&rsquo;s models being determined uniquely up to
isomorphism. (As Carnap realized later, one direction of this
theorem&mdash; the semantic completeness of a theory entailing its
categoricity&mdash;<em>fails</em>; a corrected version of the theorem,
acknowledging Carnap&rsquo;s earlier work, appeared later in Tarski
and Lindenbaum 1935. See Awodey &amp; Carus 2001, Schiemer 2012.)
Other than showing Carnap&rsquo;s interest in categorical
axiomatizations, which he shares with modern-day structuralists about
mathematics (e.g., Shapiro 1997), the &ldquo;Untersuchungen&rdquo;
also include an account of structural properties: &ldquo;The
structural properties are in a way the properties invariant under
isomorphic transformations&rdquo; (see also Korbmacher &amp; Schiemer
2018). If taken together with Tarski&rsquo;s later criterion, this
means that, within the boundaries of the framework of simple type
theory, structural properties are precisely the properties that can be
expressed by means of logical concepts alone (including
<em>higher-order</em> logical concepts).</p>

<p>
As described in
 <a href="#ObseTermSentCarnLateWorkRecoScieTheo">sections 3</a>
 and 4 above, Carnap&rsquo;s mature philosophy of science involves two
essential components: first, it works out a distinction between
observation terms and theoretical terms and related characterizations
of different types of laws and sublanguages serving different
scientific functions. Secondly, it suggests that a scientific theory
be reconstructed by, first, axiomatizing it in a linguistic
framework&mdash;yielding, say, a conjunction <i>Th</i> of axioms in a
formal language (which may be interpreted by model-theoretic
means)&mdash;and then, subsequently, by determining the Ramsey
sentence \(R[\Th]\) and the Carnap sentence \(C[\Th]\) of the theory,
by which the theory&rsquo;s respective synthetic and the analytic
content may be expressed within the (higher-order) object language
 (<a href="#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">section 4</a>
 above). Also the Carnap sentence, which is meant to fix the meaning
of theoretical terms, may be replaced by an explicit definition of
theoretical terms using higher-order Hilbertian epsilon terms (also
 <a href="#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">section 4</a>
 above). We will now reconsider these theory components from a
structuralist point of view.</p>

<p>
Observational terms and sentences are regarded in Carnap&rsquo;s
mature theory reconstructions as fully interpreted; their fully
determinate extensional and intensional contents clearly exceed merely
&ldquo;structural content&rdquo;. However, we will see that Carnap
reconstructs <em>theoretical terms</em> as <em>denoting only
structure</em>&mdash;they may be viewed as &ldquo;structure
symbols&rdquo; standing for structures or elements of
structures&mdash;whereby the &ldquo;excess&rdquo; content of theories
beyond their empirical content is <em>structural</em>.</p>

<p>
Let us start with Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of a theory <i>Th</i>
as the conjunction of \(R[\Th]\) and \(C[\Th]\), or of \(R[\Th]\) and
a definition of theoretical terms by higher-order epsilon terms. As
explained in
 <a href="#Crit">section 5</a>,
 the Ramsey sentence \(R[\Th]\) may be shown to be true if and only if
(other than a cardinality constraint being satisfied) <i>Th</i> is
empirically adequate. That is: the synthetic content of <i>Th</i>,
according to Carnap, coincides with its empirical content. In order to
see that what is added by \(C[\Th]\) or the definition of theoretical
terms by epsilon terms&mdash;the analytic part of <i>Th</i>&mdash;is
simply an assignment of structural content to theoretical terms, it
turns out to be instructive to compare Carnap&rsquo;s interpretation
of theoretical terms to a recent proposal by structuralists in the
philosophy of mathematics for how <em>mathematical</em> terms ought to
be interpreted.</p>

<p>
Structuralists in the philosophy of mathematics understand mathematics
as the study of (pure) structure (see Hellman and Shapiro 2018, and
section 4 of the entry on
 <a href="../philosophy-mathematics/index.html">philosophy of mathematics</a>
 for recent surveys). One question which structuralists of all stripes
need to face is how to reconstruct the meaning of mathematical terms
logically and semantically, for example &lsquo;<i>i</i>,&rsquo;
&ldquo;the natural number structure,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the group
structure&rdquo;. A standard realist semantics and metasemantics might
not, after all, be able to interpret such terms (e.g.,
&ldquo;<em>the</em> (uniquely determined?) natural number
structure&rdquo;) in the intended structuralist way. According to a
recent and influential structuralist proposal for the semantics of
mathematical terms (see, e.g., Shapiro 2007, Pettigrew 2007),
mathematical terms behave logically much like terms introduced by the
assumption of the natural deduction rule of existential elimination;
according to that rule, once an existential statement of the form
\(\exists x A[x]\) has been derived, one may introduce a
&ldquo;parameter&rdquo; <i>a</i>, that is, a &ldquo;new&rdquo;
variable or constant, for which one assumes that
\(A[a]\)&mdash;mathematicians would express this step by &ldquo;Let
<i>a</i> be any of the <i>x</i>s for which \(A[x]\) is the
case&rdquo;&mdash;and one proceeds subsequently by using \(A[a]\) in
the derivation. Similarly, the structuralist proposal suggests that
elements of mathematical structures or the mathematical structures
themselves are named by introducing <em>parameters for them on the
basis of existence statements</em>. For instance, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
provably, there exist two numerically distinct square roots of
&minus;1 in the complex number field; let &lsquo;<i>i</i>&rsquo;
denote any of them (hence &lsquo;&minus;<i>i</i>&rsquo; denotes the
other one). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here, the name &lsquo;<i>i</i>&rsquo; is to be regarded as a parameter
again. In this way, it is claimed, the two complex roots of &minus;1
can be named in some sense, even though they are structurally
indistinguishable elements of the complex field structure, that is,
there is an isomorphism from the field of complex numbers to itself
that maps <i>i</i> to <em>&ndash;i</em> and <em>vice versa</em>. (For
the same reason, Brandom 1996 calls terms such as
&lsquo;<i>i</i>&rsquo; and &lsquo;&minus;<i>i</i>&rsquo; &ldquo;merely
distinguishing terms&rdquo;). Which solves a problem that
structuralists about mathematics face, that is, to explain how
mathematicians seem to be able to name mathematical entities that are
structurally indistinguishable. Similarly, a set-theoretic
structuralist may understand the term &ldquo;the natural number
structure&rdquo; as denoting <em>any</em> of the infinitely many
pairwise isomorphic set-theoretic systems that satisfy the categorical
axiom system of second-order Dedekind-Peano arithmetic: &ldquo;the
natural number structure&rdquo; is a parameter again that may be
introduced once the existence of at least one natural number system
has been proven or presupposed. In the same way, one might denote an
algebraic structure, such as &ldquo;the group structure&rdquo;, by a
parameter, which is possible even though the conjunction of the groups
axioms is not even categorical anymore (the group axioms do not pin
down the structure of a group uniquely): there is an infinite class of
groups, such that no two of them are isomorphic to each other, and the
name &ldquo;the group structure&rdquo; &ldquo;picks&rdquo; any of
them, without any fact of the matter which of them is
&ldquo;picked&rdquo; exactly. The only difference between the actual
logical rule of existential elimination and the structuralist
treatment of mathematical terms as &ldquo;parameters&rdquo;, these
structuralists add, consists in the fact that in order to complete an
application of existential elimination one actually needs to discharge
the supposition \(A[a]\) before one can derive a formula outside of
the suppositional context, and the &ldquo;parameter&rdquo; <i>a</i>
itself is not allowed to occur free in the formula thus derived.
Whereas, according to this structuralist proposal, mathematicians
simply stick to their newly introduced names for mathematical
structures or their elements without ever discharging any assumptions
when deriving theorems about them (or without even thinking they have
supposed anything at all).</p>

<p>
Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of the analytic part of, say, a theory
\(\Th[T]\) with precisely one theoretical term <i>T</i>, by means of
the Carnap sentence</p> 

\[
C[\Th[T]]: \exists X \Th[X] \rightarrow  \Th[T]
\]

<p>
or by means of the definition</p> 

\[
T = eX\Th[X]
\]

<p>
is clearly just <em>a different way of formulating the very same
structuralist treatment of names in logical terms</em> (on the level
of the object language): for Carnap, a theoretical term <i>T</i> is
indeed nothing but a &ldquo;parameter&rdquo; that &ldquo;picks&rdquo;
indeterminately any <i>X</i> for which \(\Th[X]\) is the case, if
there is such an <i>X</i> at all (see
 <a href="#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">section 4</a>).
 Shapiro (2007: 299) even mentions the interpretation of mathematical
terms by epsilon terms as an alternative rendering of the intended
structuralist semantics for mathematical terms (though without
acknowledging Carnap). The structuralist understanding of mathematical
terms sketched above is essentially just a reiteration of
Carnap&rsquo;s view of theoretical terms in general&mdash;whether in
mathematics or in science. (See Schiemer &amp; Gratzl 2016 for more
parallels between this form of mathematical structuralism and
Carnap&rsquo;s epsilon term approach.)</p>

<p>
So far, the correspondence we have been discussing between the
structuralist reconstruction of mathematical terms and Carnap&rsquo;s
reconstruction of theoretical terms has been based solely on the idea
that terms are assumed to &ldquo;pick&rdquo; their references
indeterminately on both sides. But in fact the correspondence is much
tighter, since, for Carnap, the intended universe of discourse over
which the variables of the scientific language <i>L</i> (after
reconstruction) range are individuals at the first-order level and
<em>mathematical constructions</em> over these individuals at
higher-order levels. So both mathematical individuals, e.g., natural
numbers, and observable individuals are in the first-order domain;
classes of such individuals are in the second-order domain (assuming
an extensional interpretation of higher-order variables); classes of
such classes are in the third-order domain&mdash;and so forth. Carnap
(1956, 1958) even suggests that observable individuals may themselves
be &ldquo;coded&rdquo; by purely mathematical entities&mdash;e.g., by
labeling physical bodies or events by numbers (Carnap 1958: 242), or
by representing them as classes of quadruples of real numbers (the
classes of space-time points they occupy relative to a given
coordinate system, see Carnap 1956a: 43f). Indeed, Carnap had already
proposed the method of naming objects by &ldquo;positional
coordinates&rdquo; (e.g., space-time-coordinates) in the <em>Logical
Syntax</em>, where he described it as corresponding to a &ldquo;more
advanced stage of science&rdquo; than the designation of objects by
proper names (see &sect;3 of <em>Logical Syntax</em>, and see
&ldquo;Carnap on <em>Logical Syntax of Language</em>&rdquo;). Once
such a &ldquo;coding&rdquo; has been determined, e.g., when a
particular physical body <i>k</i> has been labeled by the number 17,
the theoretical assignment of a particular physical mass to 17 is to
be interpreted as an assignment of that mass to the physical body
<i>k</i> (Carnap 1958: 242). In that way, <em>all</em> variables of
<i>L</i> may be assumed to range just over <em>purely mathematical
entities</em>: mathematical individuals, classes of such individuals,
classes of such classes, and so on (see Carnap 1963b: 963). If
interpreted along these lines, both <em>how</em> Carnapian theoretical
terms &ldquo;pick&rdquo; entities and <em>what</em> they
&ldquo;pick&rdquo; coincides with the mathematical structuralist
proposal discussed above; a Carnapian theoretical term <i>T</i>
<em>literally</em> functions in the same way as
&lsquo;<i>i</i>&rsquo;, &ldquo;the natural number structure&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;the group structure&rdquo; do in that proposal by
mathematical structuralists. More particularly, in modern terminology,
Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of scientific theories combines this
structuralist semantics with a <em>neutral</em> version of
mathematical structuralism that <em>neither postulates</em> the
existence of special structure entities &ldquo;sui generis&rdquo; (as
in non-eliminative structuralism) over and above the existence of
structured set-theoretic systems <em>nor denies</em> the existence of
such &ldquo;sui generis&rdquo; entities (as in eliminative
structuralism)&mdash;see Hellman and Shapiro 2018 for more on this
distinction. (It should be noted that Carnap does not actually
<em>need</em> to interpret the higher-order variables in a Ramsey
sentence extensionally, that is, as ranging over all classes of the
appropriate type&mdash;an intensional interpretation would be
available to him as well by which these variables would range over all
intensional concepts of the appropriate type. Psillos (1999: 55) cites
a letter to Feigl in which Carnap sketches such an intensional
interpretation, but then Psillos wrongly assumes (1999: 56f) that
Carnapian intensions expressed by theoretical terms could not be
viewed as mathematical entities any more. In fact, they could: as
functions from state descriptions to mathematical objects, where these
functions would not necessarily map all state descriptions to one and
the same mathematical object; see the supplement on
 <a href="semantics.html#InteSema">Semantics (Section 1)</a>
 for more on Carnapian intensions.)</p>

<p>
Of course, Carnap&rsquo;s position should not be misunderstood as
claiming that empirical science deals with pure mathematics: he only
means that it is always <em>possible</em> to <em>reconstruct</em>
scientific theories in that way, since all sorts of entities
<em>can</em> be <em>represented</em> mathematically. Using fixed
mathematical codes for observable individuals and hence classes of
such codes as extensions for observational predicates is not meant to
affect (up to the given &ldquo;coding&rdquo;) the intended
interpretation of observational predicates that had been assumed from
the start. As far as non-observable individuals are concerned, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
it is <em>not necessary</em> [our emphasis] to assume new sorts of
objects for the descriptive T-terms of theoretical physics (Carnap
1958: 81 in the English version) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
either: they <em>may</em> be identified with mathematical entities,
this time without any fixed coding being in place. And the extensions
of theoretical predicates are classes, classes of classes,&hellip; of
the fixed codes of observable individuals and the unspecified
mathematical proxies for unobservable individuals, where the
assignment of such extensions to theoretical predicates is achieved
purely theoretically, that is, by means of the Carnap sentence or by a
definition through higher-order epsilon terms. As Carnap (1963b: 963)
clarifies in his reply to Hempel in the Schilpp volume: while the
Ramsey sentence</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
does indeed refer to theoretical entities by the use of abstract
variables&hellip; it should be noted that the entities are&hellip;
purely logico-mathematical entities, e.g., natural numbers, classes of
such, classes of classes, etc. Nevertheless, [the Ramsey sentence] is
obviously a factual sentence. It says that the observable events in
the world are such that there are numbers, classes of such, etc.,
which are correlated with the events in a prescribed way and which
have among themselves certain relations; and this assertion is clearly
a factual statement about the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
What is more, from Carnap&rsquo;s point of view, the difference
between a framework of <em>&ldquo;real&rdquo; unobservable first-order
entities and &ldquo;real&rdquo; theoretical higher-order</em> entities
and a framework of <em>purely mathematical unobservable first-order
entities and purely mathematical theoretical higher-order</em>
entities is merely linguistic (an external matter of framework choice,
see the supplement on
 <a href="tolerance-metaphysics.html">Tolerance, Metaphysics, and Meta-Ontology</a>).
 While the &ldquo;reality&rdquo; of the observable individuals over
which the first-order variables of the purely observational
sublanguage \(L_O\) of <i>L</i> range simply consists in the empirical
adequacy of <i>Th</i> (compare the related discussion of Carnap 1956a:
45, which predates the Ramsification approach), the question of the
&ldquo;reality&rdquo; of entities over which the first-order or
higher-order variables of the purely theoretical sublanguage \(L_T\)
of <i>L</i> range can only be understood as the question of what
language we should use, and the same point extends to all values of
variables of the full language <i>L</i> other than observable
individuals:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We have considered some of the kinds of entities referred to in
mathematics, physics, psychology, and the social sciences and have
indicated that they belong to the [purely mathematical] domain
<i>D</i>. However, I wish to emphasize here that this talk about the
admission of this or that kind of entity as values of variables in
\(L_T\) is only a way of speaking intended to make the use of \(L_T\),
and especially the use of quantified variables in \(L_T\), more easily
understandable. Therefore the explanations just given must not be
understood as implying that those who accept and use a language are
thereby committed to certain &ldquo;ontological&rdquo; doctrines in
the traditional metaphysical sense. The usual ontological questions
about the &ldquo;<em>reality</em>&rdquo; (in an alleged metaphysical
sense) of numbers, classes, space-time points, bodies, minds, etc.,
are pseudo-questions without cognitive content. (Carnap 1956a:
44&ndash;45)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For Carnap, the language of mathematics is itself just a way to
indicate structure, leaving open what the structure in question is a
structure <em>of</em> (which is again close to modern structuralism
about mathematics, as in Benacerraf 1965):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;0&rdquo; designates the number zero, &ldquo;<em>0&acute;</em>
&rdquo; the number one, etc. &hellip; On the other hand, the essential
service that the expressions &ldquo;0&rdquo; etc. give, consists in
the fact that they represent a particular kind of structure
(<em>viz.</em>, a sequence with an initial member but no terminal
member). Thus the structure can be uniquely specified but the elements
of the structure cannot. Not because we are ignorant of their nature;
rather, there is no question of their nature. (Carnap 1956a: 46)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So understood, then, when Carnap reconstructs a scientific theory
<i>Th</i> as the conjunction of the Ramsey sentence \(R[\Th]\) and the
Carnap sentence \(C[\Th]\), or as the conjunction of \(R[\Th]\) and a
definition of theoretical terms by higher-order epsilon terms, he
effectively reconstructs <i>Th</i> as a <em>combination of its
empirical content with the purely structural content of theoretical
terms that is assigned along the lines of a structuralist semantics
and metasemantics</em>. \(R[\Th]\), whose variables range over
mathematical entities, reconstructs the empirical content of the
<i>Th</i>. \(C[\Th]\), or the definition of theoretical terms by
epsilon terms, adds to this the analytic content of <i>Th</i>, and
this analytic content turns into purely structural content once
Carnap&rsquo;s choice of the purely mathematical values of variables
is in place. Theoretical terms in science are reconstructed as
&ldquo;structure symbols&rdquo; that stand for structures or elements
of structures into which, in the words of Friedman (2011), &ldquo;the
observable phenomena are to be embedded&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Carnap&rsquo;s approach liberates us from the intractable
philosophical debate between instrumentalism and realism. The only
&ldquo;ontological&rdquo; question that now matters concerns the
existence of an appropriate mathematical structure into which the
observable phenomena are to be embedded&mdash;and this question, in
turn, is answered within the ongoing practice of modern mathematical
physics itself. For the great advances of modern mathematical physics,
from Carnap&rsquo;s point of view, consist precisely in the discovery
of appropriate systems of abstract axioms (and correspondence rules)
characterizing the mathematical structures in question. (Friedman
2011: 260f)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The remaining question, then, is this: how does Carnap&rsquo;s mature
structuralist reconstruction scientific theories relate to currently
discussed versions of realism, antirealism, and structural realism
about scientific theories (all of which Carnap would have understood
as different choices of frameworks for science)? (Psillos [1999:
61&ndash;63] argues convincingly that Carnap&rsquo;s own comments on
this question don&rsquo;t always get to the heart of the matter; e.g.,
Carnap&rsquo;s occasional <em>syntactic</em> attempt of identifying
scientific realism with the choice of a scientific language that
includes theoretical terms is insufficient. See Demopoulos 2011 for
how Carnap&rsquo;s views in &ldquo;Empiricism, Semantics and
Ontology&rdquo; extend to the traditional realism/instrumentalism
debate.)</p>

<p>
As argued above in
 <a href="#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">section 4</a>,
 Carnap&rsquo;s mature reconstruction of theories is clearly not
&ldquo;syntactically&rdquo; anti-realist in the sense of eliminating
theoretical terms. Indeed, Carnap thinks that, for scientific
purposes, a standard &ldquo;realist language&rdquo; that includes
theoretical terms is pragmatically superior to an
&ldquo;instrumentalist language&rdquo; with only observational and
logical terms (see Carnap 1966: 253f). So the reconstruction of
scientific theories should not eliminate theoretical terms but
reconstruct them. Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of scientific theories
also differs from the most influential contemporary antirealist
position concerning science, van Fraassen&rsquo;s (1980) constructive
empiricism (see entry on
 <a href="../constructive-empiricism/index.html">constructive empiricism</a>
 for a summary). While neither of them is revisionary about scientific
object language(s), and both maintain that science aims at empirical
adequacy, van Fraassen presupposes a standard realist semantics and
metasemantics for <em>all</em> scientific expressions, whereas Carnap
restricts that kind of semantics to observational terms but regards
the interpretation of theoretical terms in science to be partial and
given by something like an indeterminately specified choice function
to epsilon-terms. This has the consequence that, up to analytic
postulates, truth for Carnap simply <em>is</em> empirical adequacy,
which is not the case for van Fraassen. As Friedman (2011: 258)
summarizes the situation: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
There can&hellip; be no gap, in Carnap&rsquo;s conception, between the
empirical adequacy of a partially interpreted theory and the full
(semantical) truth of this same theory. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(One should add: no gap <em>up to analytic postulates</em>, that is,
given the understanding described above, <em>up to additional
structural content</em>.) The reason that there is no such gap can be
explained as follows: for simplicity, assume again there to be just
one theoretical term <i>T</i> that is introduced by a theory
<i>Th</i>. Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of <i>T</i> as an epsilon
term corresponds to the definition \(T = eX\Th[X]\), and because the
sentence \(\exists X\Th[X] \rightarrow \Th[eX\Th[X]]\) is a logical
truth in the epsilon-calculus, it follows that \(\exists X\Th[X]
\rightarrow \Th[T]\). Since the converse \(\Th[T] \rightarrow \exists
X\Th[X]\) is a logical truth of higher-order logic, and since
\(\Th[T]\) is simply <i>Th</i>, we may conclude \(\Th \leftrightarrow
\exists X\Th[X]\), which thus follows solely by logic and definitions.
Therefore, a theory and its Ramsey sentence turn out to be
<em>analytically equivalent</em> in Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction.</p>

<p>
While Carnap reconstructs the <em>content</em> of a scientific theory
differently from van Fraassen and realists about science, he retains
the realist idea that a scientist&rsquo;s <em>attitude</em> towards a
theory may well be that of <em>belief in its truth</em> (which Carnap
would reconstruct probabilistically, and the prior probabilities for
which he would assume to satisfy structural invariance conditions
themselves&mdash;see the supplement on
 <a href="inductive-logic.html">Inductive Logic</a>.).
 Van Fraassen (1980), in contrast, construes the content of a theory
as given by a realist semantics and metasemantics but at the same time
suggests the attitude towards the non-observational commitments of a
theory&rsquo;s should be one of mere acceptance: a mental attitude
pragmatically like belief but which, unlike belief, does not aim at
the truth of a theory as a whole but only at the truth of the
observational consequences of a theory. This said, there is also some
overlap between Carnap&rsquo;s preferred mature reconstruction of
science and van Fraassen&rsquo;s anti-realist understanding of
science: since the truth of a theory coincides for Carnap with its
empirical adequacy (up to analytic postulates), belief in the truth of
a theory actually coincides for him with belief in the empirical
adequacy of the theory (up to analytic postulates), just as for van
Fraassen the acceptance of a theory involves the belief in its
empirical adequacy. And when Carnap suggests that the only sensible
answer to the only sensible interpretation of an external existence
question is a proposal for the acceptance of a linguistic framework,
then that kind of linguistic acceptance is of a similar practical type
of commitment as van Fraassen&rsquo;s mere acceptance of the
non-observational parts of a theory. Which is not to say, of course,
that van Fraassen would have to buy into the Carnapian
internal-external distinction at all. We conclude that, in spite of
some overlap, Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of science does not
coincide with van Fraassen&rsquo;s paradigmatic present-day
anti-realist position about science, the most significant difference
being their distinct semantics and metasemantics of theoretical
terms.</p>

<p>
At the same time, Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of scientific theories
is not a standard modern realist one either: this is once again
because he assumes standard realist semantics and metasemantics to
apply only to observation terms, while theoretical terms are regarded
as partially interpreted, requiring a &ldquo;semantic choice&rdquo;
element that departs from the standard semantics; and additionally
because Carnap assumes that what theoretical terms &ldquo;choose
from&rdquo; semantically is pure mathematical structure. Realists
about a scientific <em>theory</em> <i>Th</i>&mdash;like van Fraassen,
but unlike Carnap&mdash;want to distinguish between the truth of
<i>Th</i> on the one hand and the combination of the empirical
adequacy of <i>Th</i> (the truth of \(R[\Th]\)) with the analyticity
of the Carnap sentence \(C[\Th]\) on the other. Indeed, neither van
Fraassen nor a standard realist would regard the Carnap sentence of
<i>Th</i> as analytic (if they were to accept any analytic-synthetic
distinction at all). By their realist semantics/metasemantics,
\(C[\Th]\) may well be false, and even when it is true, it may be so
contingently. On the other hand&mdash;unlike van Fraassen, but like
Carnap&mdash;realists take the default attitude of scientists towards
theories to be belief in their truth. In fact, Carnap is in a position
both to agree with the realists that the aim of science is truth and
to agree with van Fraassen that the aim of science is empirical
adequacy, since for Carnap&mdash;up to analytic
equivalence&mdash;truth and empirical adequacy coincide.</p>

<p>
What kind of surplus content would modern realists like to ascribe to
scientific theories and their theoretical terms over and above a
Carnapian combination of empirical and structural content? First,
realists would want to insist that the unobservable individuals in the
intended &ldquo;actual&rdquo; model of their theories (some of which
may belong to the extensions of theoretical terms, such as, e.g.,
electrons) are <em>concrete</em> individuals (e.g., belonging to the
physical world), not abstract mathematical entities. This contrasts
with Carnap&rsquo;s preferred reconstruction, as explained above. (The
issue is much less relevant to van Fraassen than to realists, since
van Fraassen does not recommend belief in the truth of unobservable
entities anyway.) Other than these differences concerning unobservable
individuals, realists would also replace or extend Carnap&rsquo;s
treatment of theoretical terms and what they stand for, to which they
would prefer a purely causal-referential account, for instance,
starting from something like Kripke-Putnam considerations about kind
terms. Such a realist account would require supplementation, though,
as theoretical predicates in scientific language plainly do not
acquire their reference in the way, e.g., the proper name
&ldquo;Aristotle&rdquo; does, or the kind term &ldquo;tiger&rdquo;.
One cannot simply point to &ldquo;the&rdquo; property of being an
electron and baptize it &ldquo;electron property&rdquo; (where would
one point?), or baptize &ldquo;the&rdquo; property of being an
electron with the help of describing it first as being responsible for
certain causal effects (what kind of &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo;
would be meant, and how direct or indirect would it be?), or point to
an electron and call everything &ldquo;similar&rdquo; to it in the
&ldquo;right&rdquo; sense an electron (what would be the right sense
of similarity here?). See Psillos (1999: Chapter 12) for a criticism
of unamended causal-referential accounts of theoretical terms from the
realist point of view.</p>

<p>
Alternatively, or additionally, realists might extend Carnap&rsquo;s
reconstruction by assuming the world to be carved up into natural
kinds or natural properties or ontologically &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo;
higher-order entities (or the like), and take higher-order variables
in the Ramsey-Carnap-Lewis account of theoretical terms to range over
that restricted class of higher-order entities (rather than
Carnap&rsquo;s arbitrary classes of the appropriate type). This would
only remain compatible with Carnap&rsquo;s general methodology (see
the supplement on
 <a href="methodology.html">Methodology</a>)
 if &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and &ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; themselves got
explicated in a framework-relative manner&mdash;compare the discussion
at the end of
 <a href="#TheoTermSentLogiStruTheo">section 4</a>
 above. (Carnap&rsquo;s closely related attempt in the <em>Aufbau</em>
of defining the basic predicate of his phenomenalist constitution
system in purely logical terms by restricting relations to
&ldquo;founded&rdquo; ones, failed&mdash;because &ldquo;founded&rdquo;
was not properly logical. See supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html#ReceLateDiscAufb"><em>Aufbau</em> (Section 3)</a>.)
 In the case of the definition of theoretical terms by second-order
definite descriptions (the second-order version of Lewis&rsquo; 1970
definition of theoretical terms by first-order definite descriptions),
restricting the range of variables to &ldquo;non-gerrymandered&rdquo;
entities would also help address the worry that the uniqueness claims
presupposed by such second-order <em>definite</em> descriptions might
fail to be satisfied (compare Papineau 1996: 6). Even in the
first-order version, Lewis would be forced to say more about which
reifications of properties and relations are supposed to inhabit the
first-order domain and why others should not be assumed to do so. None
of this constitutes a worry for Carnap, whose higher-order epsilon
terms are <em>in</em>definite descriptions that do not presuppose
unique satisfaction of their body clauses&mdash;and the possible
values of which are taken from all classes of the appropriate
type.</p>

<p>
Or a realist might modify the descriptive Ramsey-Carnap account by
building causal features into it, as suggested by Psillos (1999), who
advocates a causal-descriptive analysis of theoretical terms based on
&ldquo;core causal descriptions of kind-constitutive
properties&rdquo;. Carnap would be likely to regard such references to
causality and kinds as &ldquo;more theory&rdquo;, which, once
explicated, might well be built into the term-defining clauses. (That
is also how Schurz 2014: 305, suggests explicating Psillos&rsquo;s
proposal and related ones.) In any case, these are some ways in which
Carnap&rsquo;s account of theoretical terms would differ from a
realist one.</p>

<p>
In line with modern structural realism (see Worrall 1989), Carnap was
interested in the stable mathematical structures that survive the
revision of empirically successful theories, and he regards his
reconstruction of theories and theoretical terms as capturing the
conceptual schemes that express these structures:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The position is often taken that the introduction of theoretical terms
for such things in theoretical physics as forces, fields, particles,
and the like involves certain conceptual difficulties. How should we
conceive these things which we can never directly observe? <em>How
should we construct a general conceptual scheme in which not only the
object of an already given scheme of physics may fit, but also others,
perhaps forces, particles, or special objects of an entirely new kind
of which we presently have no conception but which a physicist might
introduce tomorrow?</em> [Our emphasis] These difficulties do not
enter for the form of theoretical language described above. Here only
the following two types of objects enter. First, the things designated
by the <i>O</i>-terms, namely the observable things and their
observable properties and relations and second, the mathematical
objects of the types of systems described earlier, namely the natural
numbers, classes of these and so forth. (1958 [1975: 80])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By reconstructing theoretical terms as partial and open-ended (recall
sections 1, 3, 4 above), Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction explains how
the meaning of theoretical terms can be refined continuously in the
course of scientific progress (by gradually restricting or revising
the range of entities from which their denotations are chosen). To
regard theoretical terms as denoting mathematical entities, moreover,
helps us understand what they track&mdash;structures that are
successfully described and explained by previous theories, current
theories, and future theories alike. Just as the cognitive value of
structural statements in the phenomenalist system of the
<em>Aufbau</em> were meant to be invariant across different subjects
(see supplement on
 <a href="aufbau.html"><em>Aufbau</em> (Section 2)</a>),
 the later Carnap&rsquo;s reconstruction of scientific concepts and
statements in structural terms may be understood as clarifying which
of their features remain invariant across theory change.</p>

<p>
Carnap&rsquo;s account also avoids the so-called Newman problem (see
Demopoulos and Friedman 1985), which threatens to affect versions of
structural realism that claim the structural content of theories to
exceed their empirical content but which at the same time reconstruct
a theory&rsquo;s structural content by means of its Ramsey sentence.
Carnap&rsquo;s proposal does <em>not</em> identify the structural
content of a theory with what is expressed by the Ramsey sentence of
the theory: it is the <em>Carnap sentence</em> or the definition of
theoretical terms by higher-order epsilon terms (interpreted over a
mathematical universe, as explained before) that expresses the
structural content of a theory over and above what is expressed by its
Ramsey sentence. The Ramsey sentence itself expresses the empirical
content of the theory precisely because its higher-order variables
range over arbitrary classes of the appropriate type. (Psillos 1999
argues that Carnap&rsquo;s account <em>is</em> affected by the Newman
problem, but that is because Psillos assumes that the structural
content of a theory would have to be given by its Ramsey sentence; see
Friedman 2011 for a rebuttal of Psillos&rsquo; argument, though not
exactly along the lines suggested here.)</p>

<p>
Finally, Carnap&rsquo;s conceptual (linguistic, semantic)
structuralism differs both from contemporary epistemic and ontic
structural realism. It may still be said to <em>entail</em> an
epistemic structuralism, but only because it takes the
<em>propositional content</em> of our theoretical beliefs to be
structural, not because of any special fundamental <em>epistemic</em>
inability to know the &ldquo;intrinsic nature&rdquo; of the world
(whatever that might be). Unlike ontic structural realism,
Carnap&rsquo;s philosophy of science aims to remain neutral about a
scientific theory&rsquo;s ontological commitments beyond the
observable realm, neither accepting nor rejecting the existence of
&ldquo;worldly&rdquo; structure entities&mdash;the structural content
of a theory is only committed to there being something <em>of
which</em> the structure is so-and-so. When the final sentence of
Carnap&rsquo;s <em>Philosophical Foundations of Physics</em> speaks of
the &ldquo;structure of the world&rdquo;, this is not a reference to
ontic structuralism but rather to Carnap&rsquo;s structural conception
of the <em>language</em> of empirical science (much as Carnap&rsquo;s
1928a, <em>The Logical Structure of the World</em>, concerned the
logical structure of our scientific <em>concepts</em>): </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Whether it will be soon or later, we may trust&mdash;provided the
world&rsquo;s leading statesman refrain from the ultimate folly of
nuclear war and permit humanity to survive&mdash;science will continue
to make great progress and lead us to ever deeper insights into the
structure of the world. (Carnap 1966: 292)</p>

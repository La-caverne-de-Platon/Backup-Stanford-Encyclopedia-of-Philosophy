 Gabriel Biel (c. 1425&ndash;1495), one of the last of the great
Scholastics, has also at times been identified as an occasionalist.
For instance, see Freddoso 1998, 81&ndash;83. Freddoso cites a very
interesting summary of Biel&rsquo;s view on causation from Molina&rsquo;s
<em>Concordia</em> 159&ndash;60 (&ldquo;De Concursu Dei generali,&rdquo; Q.
14., A. 13, disp. 25). Here is the passage in question:</p>

<blockquote>
He is of the opinion that secondary causes bring about nothing at all,
but that God by Himself alone produces all the effects in them and in
their presence, so that fire does not produce heat and the sun does
not give light, but instead it is God who produces these effects in
them and in their presence. Hence &hellip; he claims that secondary
causes are not <em>properly</em> causes in the sense of having an
influence on the effect; for it is only the First Cause which he
affirms to be a cause in this sense, whereas secondary causes, he
claims, should be called causes <em>sine qua non</em>, insofar as God
has decided not to produce the effect except when they are present.
&hellip; He also asserts with Peter D&rsquo;Ailly that when God
produces an effect in conjunction with fire, He contributes no less
than He would contribute were He to produce the same effect by
Himself&mdash;in fact, He brings about more, since not only does He
produce the heat with a concurrence just as great as if the fire were
not present, but He also brings it about that the fire too is in its
own way a cause of the heat (The translation is Freddoso&rsquo;s).
</blockquote>

<p>
Though the beginning of the paragraph strongly suggests that Biel was
indeed an occasionalist, it is curious that in the latter half of the
paragraph he is identified with Peter D&rsquo;Ailly as asserting that
&ldquo;fire too is in its own way a cause of the heat.&rdquo; That
Biel held with D&rsquo;Ailly that &ldquo;God brings it about that fire
too is in its own way a cause of the heat&rdquo; suggests that Biel
held that certain natural effects are causally overdetermined by God
and the creature. If so, this raises questions about how consistently
Biel was committed to occasionalism.</p>

 Occasionalists and &ldquo;pre-established harmonists&rdquo; do not
deny the causal activity that the infinite substance, God, exerts on
finite substances. Thus, they affirm inter-substantial causation
insofar as the causal agent is God.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Historically speaking, it has not been an easy proposition to come up
with a convincing account of how this joint causal activity between
God and the creature is supposed to work. On the concurrentist
account, God obviously is doing more than merely conserving the being
of the creature along with its power. For God is in some sense
causally active in bringing about the effect in a direct manner.
However, this direct causal activity of God must differ from the way
in which God is the sole direct cause of the effect, which is how the
occasionalist regards the divine causal activity in question. In what
sense God is doing more but not as much as the occasionalist&rsquo;s account
has been the topic of much discussion and disagreement. In fact,
Malebranche shrewdly points out in <em>Elucidation</em> 15 that the
disagreement is so great that &ldquo;[w]hen people who have no special
interest preventing them from agreeing cannot agree, it is a sure sign
that they have no clear idea of what they are saying.&rdquo;
(<em>Search</em> 658)</p>

 If we employ the scheme introduced earlier&mdash;that is,
&ldquo;local&rdquo;and &ldquo;global&rdquo; arguments for
occasionalism&mdash;then the &ldquo;passive nature&rdquo; (PN) and
&ldquo;no knowledge&rdquo; (NK) arguments fall into the first
category, and the &ldquo;no necessary connection&rdquo; (NNC) and the
&ldquo;conservation is but continuous creation&rdquo; (CCC) arguments
fall into the latter category.</p>

 In the same section, Malebranche describes the asymmetry between rest
and motion in the following manner: &ldquo;The will of the Author of
nature, which creates the power and force that each body has for
continuing in the state it is in, concerns only motion and not rest,
since bodies have no power whatsoever in themselves&rdquo;
(<em>OCM</em> II 432/<em>Search</em> 517). Note that this seems to be
in tension with what Descartes says in the <em>Principles</em> II,
&sect;&sect;24&ndash;37 (AT VIII, 53&ndash;62).</p>

 Are the necessary connections being discussed here logically
necessary connections? Malebranche does not deny that the essences of
creatures logically entail certain constraints for divine causal
activity. For instance, in the <em>Dialogues</em>, Malebranche notes
that the nature of bodies&mdash;their impenetrability&mdash;obliges
God, with &ldquo;a kind of necessity,&rdquo; to move bodies when they
collide. But he also states that &ldquo;it is clear that
impenetrability has no efficacy of its own and that it can merely
provide God, who treats things according to their nature, with an
occasion to diversify His action&rdquo; (<em>Dialogues</em> VII,
&sect;XII, p.118&ndash;9). So, while certain events might logically
necessitate some sort of divine action and, hence, be an occasion for
God to act, they are not themselves causally efficacious, according to
Malebranche. So I take the necessitation in this passage from the
<em>Search</em> to be causal in nature, and not simply logical. The
interesting and complex issue of how Malebranche understands the
relation between causal necessitation and logical necessitation
requires further discussion and cannot be done full justice here. Of
particular importance is how to understand the connection that obtains
between divine volitions and their effects. It is at least a logically
necessary connection, since it is a logically necessary truth for
Malebranche that if God wills p, p obtains (insofar as p itself is not
inconsistent). But there has to be more going on, since, as we have
just seen above, the nature of bodies also obliges with this type of
necessity&mdash;that is, logical necessity&mdash;but such obliging
falls short of genuine causation, a shortcoming that does not apply to
divine volitions. For an interesting discussion about the relation of
the NK argument to the NNC argument, in addition to issues concerning
the nature of necessity involved, see Ott, 2013.</p>

 The concurrentist might think that even in the case of the initial
creation of the world <em>ex nihilo</em>, while the being or
<em>esse</em> of the creature are brought about <em>ex nihilo</em> by
God, the modes the creature possesses at creation are the result of
the concurrent activity of the creature and God. Leibniz,
interestingly enough, actually seems to be suggesting something close
to such a view in his <em>Theodicy</em> section 388.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>
 See Garber 1993, 14&ndash;5 and Winkler 2011, 298&ndash;302. Note
also that this view differs from the aforementioned position of
al-Ash&rsquo;ari, who seems to be arguing that only the modes of a
given creature are continuously recreated, while the <em>esse</em> of
the creature is somehow maintained or sustained. This hybrid view
would have an advantage in addressing worries about transtemporal
identity, since the sustained being of the creature could be invoked
to provide the basis for the numerical identity of the creature
through change. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-31">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a>
 Winkler goes on to note that this reading of continuous creation,
that is, continuous creation as continuous <em>recreation</em> is what
gives the continuous creation thesis its hold over him, if at all:
</p>

<blockquote>
I am therefore left thinking that what gives continuous creation its
hold over me is the threat it presents to the preexistence of
substantial causes. Even if God&rsquo;s causal role (contrary to both the
immanent variant and the first transeunt variant) leaves a place for a
collaborating finite being, I have trouble seeing how a finite
substance that comes into being at the very same moment as the effect
can be a productive cause of it. The substance may help to render the
effect intelligible, but if it does so only because God adjusts the
world to accommodate it, the real productive work seems to be the
privilege of God alone. (Winkler 2011, 300)

 One word of caution about how &ldquo;occasional causation&rdquo; is
being used in the literature. Steven Nadler uses the term in a
different, distinct sense:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
what I am calling &lsquo;occasional causation&rsquo; does not require any
substantial likeness between cause and effect, and does not involve
any kind of influx or communication. In the technical sense of the
term, then, no real influence occurs between cause and effect. But
occasional causation does, however, constitute a real causal
relationship and not just accidental, sequential conjunction. Thus, in
a somewhat broader (hence, weaker) sense, there is an &lsquo;influence&rsquo; of
cause upon effect, but not of a transeunt efficient nature. </p>

<p>
In simple terms, a relationship of occasional causation exists when
one thing or state of affairs brings about an effect by inducing (but
not through efficient causation...) another thing to exercise its own
efficient causal power. The relationship of occasional causation
unites one thing or state of affairs with an effect wrought (through
efficient causation, immanent or transeunt) by another thing. Thus,
the term denotes the entire process whereby one thing, A, occasions or
elicits another thing, B, to cause e.(Nadler 1994, 39)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, for Nadler, &ldquo;occasional causation&rdquo; consists in a
genuine causal relation, wherein the occasional cause
&ldquo;induces&rdquo; something else to exercise its own causal power
to produce a given effect. In contrast, by &ldquo;occasional
causation,&rdquo; I take the relation between the occasional cause and
effect to not be a genuine causal relation. That is, &ldquo;occasional
causation,&rdquo; as I will be using it, refers to the quasi-causal
relationship that holds between an occasional cause and its effect,
standardly characterized by robust regularity but not genuine
causation.</p>

 What happens when a body collides with another body? Is it not the
case that such an event must necessarily be followed by either the
first body rebounding or the second body giving up its initial
location? This fascinating question is the core issue between an
exchange between Malebranche and Fontenelle. See Schmaltz 2008b for an
excellent discussion of related issue. Also relevant is the discussion
in footnote 22 of this entry. </p>

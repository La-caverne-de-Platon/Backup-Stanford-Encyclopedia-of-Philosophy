<h1>S&oslash;ren Kierkegaard</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Dec 3, 1996; substantive revision Fri Nov 10, 2017</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
S&oslash;ren Aabye Kierkegaard (b. 1813, d. 1855) was a profound and
prolific writer in the Danish &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of intellectual
and artistic activity. His work crosses the boundaries of philosophy,
theology, psychology, literary criticism, devotional literature and
fiction. Kierkegaard brought this potent mixture of discourses to bear
as social critique and for the purpose of renewing Christian faith
within Christendom. At the same time he made many original conceptual
contributions to each of the disciplines he employed. He is known as
the &ldquo;father of existentialism&rdquo;, but at least as important
are his critiques of Hegel and of the German romantics, his
contributions to the development of modernism, his stylistic
experimentation, his vivid re-presentation of biblical figures to
bring out their modern relevance, his invention of key concepts which
have been explored and redeployed by thinkers ever since, his
interventions in contemporary Danish church politics, and his fervent
attempts to analyse and revitalise Christian faith.</p>

<h2><a name="Life">1. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s Life</a></h2>

<p>
Kierkegaard led a somewhat uneventful life. He rarely left his
hometown of Copenhagen, and travelled abroad only five
times&mdash;four times to Berlin and once to Sweden. His prime
recreational activities were attending the theatre, walking the
streets of Copenhagen to chat with ordinary people, and taking brief
carriage jaunts into the surrounding countryside. He was educated at a
prestigious boys&rsquo; school (<em>Borgerdydskolen</em>), then
attended Copenhagen University where he studied philosophy and
theology. His teachers at the university included F.C. Sibbern, Poul
Martin M&oslash;ller, and H.L. Martensen.</p>

<p>
Sibbern and M&oslash;ller were both philosophers who also wrote
fiction. The latter in particular had a great influence on
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s philosophico-literary development. Martensen also
had a profound effect on Kierkegaard, but largely in a negative
manner. Martensen was a champion of Hegelianism, and when he became
Bishop Primate of the Danish People&rsquo;s Church, Kierkegaard
published a vitriolic attack on Martensen&rsquo;s theological views.
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s brother Peter, on the other hand, was an adherent
of Martensen and himself became a bishop. Kierkegaard regarded
Martensen as one of his chief intellectual rivals. Martensen was only
five years his senior, but was already lecturing at Copenhagen
University when Kierkegaard was a student there. Martensen also
anticipated Kierkegaard&rsquo;s first major literary project, by
publishing a book on Faust. Kierkegaard, who had been working up a
project on the three great medieval figures of Don Juan, Faust and
Ahasuerus (the wandering Jew), abandoned his own project when
Martensen&rsquo;s book appeared, although he later incorporated much
of the work he had done into <em>Either/Or</em>. </p>

<p>
Another very important figure in Kierkegaard&rsquo;s life was J.L.
Heiberg, the doyen of Copenhagen&rsquo;s literati. Heiberg, more than
any other person, was responsible for introducing Hegelianism into
Denmark. Kierkegaard spent a good deal of energy trying to break into
the Heiberg literary circle, but desisted once he had found his own
voice in <em>The Concept of Irony</em>. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s first
major publication, <em>From the Papers of One Still Living</em>, is
largely an attempt to articulate a Heibergian aesthetics&mdash;which
is a modified version of Hegel&rsquo;s aesthetics. In <em>From the
Papers of One Still Living</em>, which is a critical review of Hans
Christian Andersen&rsquo;s novel <em>Only A Fiddler</em>, Kierkegaard
attacks Andersen for lacking life-development
(<em>Livs-Udvikling</em>) and an outlook on life
(<em>Livs-Anskuelse</em>) both of which Kierkegaard deemed necessary
for someone to be a genuine novelist (<em>Romandigter</em>).</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s life is more relevant to his work than is the case
for many writers. Much of the thrust of his critique of Hegelianism is
that its system of thought is abstracted from the everyday lives of
its proponents. This existential critique consists in demonstrating
how the life and work of a philosopher contradict one another.
Kierkegaard derived this form of critique from the Greek notion of
judging philosophers by their lives rather than simply by their
intellectual artefacts. The Christian ideal, according to Kierkegaard,
is even more exacting since the totality of an individual&rsquo;s
existence is the artefact on the basis of which s/he is judged by God
for h/er eternal validity. Of course a writer&rsquo;s work is an
important part of h/er existence, but for the purpose of judgement we
should focus on the whole life not just on one part.</p>

<p>
In a less abstract manner, an understanding of Kierkegaard&rsquo;s
biography is important for an understanding of his writing because his
life was the source of many of the preoccupations and repetitions
within his <em>oeuvre</em>. Because of his existentialist orientation,
most of his interventions in contemporary theory do double duty as
means of working through events from his own life. In particular
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s relations to his father and his fianc&eacute;e
Regine Olsen pervade his work. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s pseudonym Johannes
Climacus says of Socrates that &ldquo;his whole life was personal
preoccupation with himself, and then Governance comes and adds
world-historical significance to it.&rdquo; Similarly, Kierkegaard saw
himself as a &ldquo;singular universal&rdquo; whose personal
preoccupation with himself was transfigured by divine Governance into
universal significance. </p>

<p>
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s relation to his mother is the least frequently
commented upon since it is invisible in his work. His mother does not
rate a direct mention in his published works, or in his
diaries&mdash;not even on the day she died. However, for a writer who
places so much emphasis on indirect communication, and on the
semiotics of invisibility, we should regard this absence as
significant. Johannes Climacus in <em>Concluding Unscientific
Postscript</em> remarks, &ldquo;&hellip; how deceptive then, that an
omnipresent being should be recognisable precisely by being
invisible.&rdquo; Although Kierkegaard&rsquo;s mother is absent, his
mother-tongue (<em>Modersmaal</em>&mdash;etymologically derived from
the words for &ldquo;mother&rdquo; and &ldquo;measure&rdquo;) is
almost omnipresent. Kierkegaard was deeply enamoured of the Danish
language and worked throughout his writings to assert the strengths of
his mother-tongue over the invasive, imperialistic influences of Latin
and German. With respect to the former, Kierkegaard had to petition
the king to be allowed to write his philosophy dissertation <em>On the
Concept of Irony with constant reference to Socrates</em> in Danish.
Even though permission was granted he was still required to defend his
dissertation publicly in Latin. Latin had been the pan-European
language of science and scholarship. In Denmark, in
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s time, German language and culture were at least as
dominant as Latin in the production of knowledge. In defiance of this,
Kierkegaard revelled in his mother-tongue and created some of the most
beautifully poetic prose in the Danish language&mdash;including a
paean to his mother-tongue in <em>Stages On Life&rsquo;s Way</em>. In
<em>Repetition</em> (1843), the character and pseudonymous author
Constantin Constantius congratulates the Danish language on providing
the word for an important new philosophical concept,
viz. <em>Gjentagelse</em> (repetition), to replace the foreign word
&ldquo;mediation&rdquo;. In general, we might regard the Danish
language as Kierkegaard&rsquo;s umbilical attachment to the mother
whereas Latin and German represent the law of the father, especially
when employed in systematic scholarship or science
(<em>Videnskab</em>).</p>

<p>
The influence of Kierkegaard&rsquo;s father on his work has been
frequently noted. Not only did Kierkegaard inherit his father&rsquo;s
melancholy, his sense of guilt and anxiety, and his pietistic emphasis
on the dour aspects of Christian faith, but he also inherited his
talents for philosophical argument and creative imagination. In
addition Kierkegaard inherited enough of his father&rsquo;s wealth to
allow him to pursue his life as a freelance writer. The themes of
sacrificial father/son relationships, of inherited sin, of the burden
of history, and of the centrality of the &ldquo;individual, human
existence relationship, the old text, well known, handed down from the
fathers&rdquo; (<em>Postscript</em>) are repeated many times in
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s oeuvre. The father&rsquo;s sense of guilt was so
great (for having cursed God? for having impregnated
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s mother out of wedlock?) that he thought God would
punish him by taking the lives of all seven of his children before
they reached the age of 34 (the age of Jesus Christ at his
crucifixion). This was born out for all but two of the children,
S&oslash;ren and his older brother Peter. S&oslash;ren was astonished
that they both survived beyond that age. This may explain the sense of
urgency that drove Kierkegaard to write so prolifically in the years
leading up to his 34th birthday.</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s (broken) engagement to Regine Olsen has also been
the focus of much scholarly attention. The theme of a young woman
being the occasion for a young man to become &ldquo;poeticized&rdquo;
recurs in Kierkegaard&rsquo;s writings, as does the theme of the
sacrifice of worldly happiness for a higher (religious) purpose.
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s infatuation with Regine, and the sublimated
libidinal energy it lent to his poetic production, were crucial for
setting his life course. The breaking of the engagement allowed
Kierkegaard to devote himself monastically to his religious purpose,
as well as to establish his outsider status (outside the norm of
married bourgeois life). It also freed him from close personal
entanglements with women, thereby leading him to objectify them as
ideal creatures, and to reproduce the patriarchal values of his church
and father. The latter included viewing women in terms of their
traditional social roles, particularly as mothers and wives, but also
in their traditional spiritual roles as epitomes of devotion and
self-sacrifice. Nevertheless, whatever one&rsquo;s life circumstances,
social roles and gender, Kierkegaard regarded everyone as equal before
God under the aspect of eternity. </p>

<h2><a name="Rhet">2. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s Rhetoric</a></h2>

<p>
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s central problematic was <em>how to become a
Christian in Christendom</em>. The task was most difficult for the
well-educated, since prevailing educational and cultural institutions
tended to produce stereotyped members of &ldquo;the crowd&rdquo;
rather than to allow individuals to discover their own unique
identities. This problem was compounded by the fact that Denmark had
recently and very rapidly been transformed from a feudal society into
a capitalist society. Universal elementary education, large-scale
migration from rural areas into cities, and greatly increased social
mobility meant that the social structure changed from a rigidly
hierarchical one to a relatively &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; one. In this
context it became increasingly difficult to &ldquo;become who you
are&rdquo; for two reasons: (i) social identities were unusually
fluid; and (ii) there was a proliferation of normalizing institutions
which produced pseudo-individuals. </p>

<p>
Given this problematic in this social context Kierkegaard perceived a
need to invent a form of communication which would not produce
stereotyped identities. On the contrary, he needed a form of rhetoric
which would force people back onto their own resources, to take
responsibility for their own existential choices, and to become who
they are beyond their socially imposed identities. In this undertaking
Kierkegaard was inspired by the figure of Socrates, whose incessant
irony undermined all knowledge claims that were taken for granted or
unreflectively inherited from traditional culture. In his dissertation
<em>On the Concept of Irony with constant reference to Socrates</em>
Kierkegaard argued that the historical Socrates used his irony in
order to facilitate the birth of subjectivity in his interlocutors.
Because they were constantly forced to abandon their immediate answers
to Socrates&rsquo; annoying questions, they had to begin to think for
themselves and to take individual responsibility for their claims
about knowledge and value.</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard sought to provide a similar service for his own
contemporaries. He used irony, parody, satire, humor, and
deconstructive techniques in order to make conventionally accepted
forms of knowledge and value untenable. He was a
gadfly&mdash;constantly irritating his contemporaries with
discomforting thoughts. He was also a midwife&mdash;assisting at the
birth of individual subjectivity by forcing his contemporaries to
develop an inner life through critical self-reflection. His art of
communication became &ldquo;the art of <em>taking away</em>&rdquo;
since he thought his audience suffered from too much knowledge rather
than too little.</p>

<p>
Hegelianism promised to make absolute knowledge available by virtue of
a science of logic. Anyone with the capacity to follow the dialectical
progression of the purportedly transparent concepts of Hegel&rsquo;s
logic would have access to the mind of God (which for Hegel was
equivalent to the logical structure of the universe). Kierkegaard
thought this to be the hubristic attempt to build a new tower of
Babel, or a <em>scala paradisi</em>&mdash;a dialectical ladder by
which humans can climb with ease up to heaven. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s
strategy was to invert this dialectic by seeking to make everything
more difficult. Instead of seeing scientific knowledge as the means of
human redemption, he regarded it as the greatest obstacle to
redemption. Instead of seeking to give people more knowledge he sought
to take away what passed for knowledge. Instead of seeking to make God
and Christian faith perfectly intelligible he sought to emphasize the
absolute transcendence by God of all human categories. Instead of
setting himself up as a religious authority, Kierkegaard used a vast
array of textual devices to undermine his authority as an author and
to place responsibility for the existential significance to be derived
from his texts squarely on the reader.</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard distanced himself from his texts by a variety of devices
which served to problematize the authorial voice for the reader. He
used pseudonyms in many of his works (both overtly aesthetic ones and
overtly religious ones). He partitioned the texts into prefaces,
forewords, interludes, postscripts, appendices. He assigned the
&ldquo;authorship&rdquo; of parts of texts to different pseudonyms,
and invented further pseudonyms to be the editors or compilers of
these pseudonymous writings. Sometimes Kierkegaard appended his name
as author, sometimes as the person responsible for publication,
sometimes not at all. Sometimes Kierkegaard would publish more than
one book on the same day. These simultaneous books embodied strikingly
contrasting perspectives. He also published whole <em>series</em> of
works simultaneously, viz. the pseudonymous works on the one hand and
on the other hand the <em>Edifying Discourses</em> published under his
own name.</p>

<p>
All of this play with narrative point of view, with contrasting works,
and with contrasting internal partitions within individual works
leaves the reader very disoriented. In combination with the incessant
play of irony and Kierkegaard&rsquo;s predilection for paradox and
semantic opacity, the text becomes a polished surface for the reader
in which the prime meaning to be discerned is the reader&rsquo;s own
reflection. Christian faith, for Kierkegaard, is not a matter of
learning dogma by rote. It is a matter of the individual repeatedly
renewing h/er passionate subjective relationship to an object which
can never be known, but only believed in. This belief is offensive to
reason, since it only exists in the face of the absurd (the paradox of
the eternal, immortal, infinite God being incarnated in time as a
finite mortal).</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s &ldquo;method of indirect communication&rdquo; was
designed to sever the reliance of the reader on the authority of the
author and on the received wisdom of the community. The reader was to
be forced to take individual responsibility for knowing who s/he is
and for knowing where s/he stands on the existential, ethical and
religious issues raised in the texts.</p>

<p>
While much of Kierkegaard&rsquo;s writing is presented indirectly,
under various pseudonyms, he did publish some works under his own name.
These works fall into three genres: (i) deliberations; (ii) edifying
discourses; and (iii) reviews. The point of indirect communication is
to position the reader to relate to the truth with appropriate
passion, rather than to communicate the truth as such. In a review,
however, it is appropriate to be objective, especially in drawing out
a novel&rsquo;s life-view and life-development. A deliberation
(<em>Overveielse</em>), on the other hand, ought to be provocative,
and turn the reader&rsquo;s assumptions topsy-turvy. It draws on
irony, the comic and is high-spirited, in order to get thoughts into
motion prior to action. A deliberation is a weighing-up, as a
propaedeutic to action. An edifying discourse [<em>Opbyggelige
Tale</em>], by contrast, &ldquo;rests in a mood&rdquo; and presupposes
that the reader is already in faith. It seeks to build up the faith
that it presupposes. Typically Kierkegaard&rsquo;s <em>Edifying
Discourses</em> invite &ldquo;that single individual, my reader&rdquo;
to dwell with a biblical passage for the sake of building up faith.
Kierkegaard published many of his <em>Edifying Discourses</em> in
short collections to accompany particular pseudonymous texts, then
later published them again in larger collections. He also published
various &ldquo;Discourses at the Communion on Fridays&rdquo;, which
closely resemble sermons (although they are delivered &ldquo;without
authority&rdquo;). These are particularly intimate addresses to the
sincere Christian, who strives to deepen the subjective passion of
faith through confession and through acceptance of divine
forgiveness.</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard draws attention to Christianity&rsquo;s &ldquo;inverted
dialectic&rdquo;, which demands that we exercise &ldquo;double
vision&rdquo;, to see in worldly things their spiritual opposites,
such as hope in hopelessness, strength in weakness and prosperity in
adversity. The inverse dialectic also requires that we
&ldquo;reduplicate&rdquo; our thoughts in our actions, but in so doing
that we &ldquo;work against ourselves&rdquo;. This was aimed at
subverting our focus on worldly goals in order to refocus on
other-worldly goals.</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s rhetorical play with the inverse Christian
dialectic was designed not to make the word of God easier to
assimilate, but to establish more clearly the absolute distance that
separates human beings from God. This was in order to emphasize that
human beings are absolutely reliant on God&rsquo;s grace for
salvation. While most commentators regard Kierkegaard&rsquo;s view to
be that <em>sin</em> is what separates human beings absolutely from
God, thereby lending weight to the view that Kierkegaard endorses a
particularly dour version of Christianity, a more defensible
interpretation is that it is the transcendent God&rsquo;s capacity to
forgive the unforgivable that marks the absolute difference. Our
struggle to accept divine forgiveness can become mired in despair,
including the second-order despair over the impossibility of
forgiveness of our sins and the demonic despair of defiance in which
we refuse to accept forgiveness. On the other hand, faith in divine
forgiveness can manifest in joy, at the realization that for God
anything is possible, including our &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo; as spiritual
selves with &ldquo;eternal validity&rdquo;.</p>

<h2><a name="Aesth">3. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s Aesthetics</a></h2>

<p>
Kierkegaard presents his &ldquo;first&rdquo; pseudonymous authorship
(<em>Either-Or</em> to <em>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</em>) as
a dialectical progression of existential stages. The first is the
aesthetic, which gives way to the ethical, which gives way to the
religious. The aesthetic stage of existence is characterized by the
following: immersion in sensuous experience; valorization of
possibility over actuality; egotism; fragmentation of the subject of
experience; nihilistic wielding of irony and scepticism; and flight
from boredom.
</p>

<p>
The figure of the aesthete in <em>Either-Or</em> (Part One) is an
ironic portrayal of German romanticism, but it also draws on medieval
characters as diverse as Don Juan, Ahasuerus, and Faust. It finds its
most sophisticated form in the author of &ldquo;The Seducer&rsquo;s
Diary&rdquo;, the final section of <em>Either-Or</em> (Part One).
Johannes the seducer is a <em>reflective aesthete</em>, who gains
sensuous delight not so much from the act of seduction but from
engineering the possibility of seduction. His real aim is the
manipulation of people and situations in ways which generate
interesting reflections in his own voyeuristic mind. The aesthetic
perspective transforms quotidian dullness into a richly poetic world
by whatever means it can. Sometimes the reflective aesthete will
inject interest into a book by reading only the last third, or into a
conversation by provoking a bore into an apoplectic fit so that he can
see a bead of sweat form between the bore&rsquo;s eyes and run down
his nose. That is, the aesthete uses artifice, arbitrariness, irony,
and wilful imagination to recreate the world in his own image. The
prime motivation for the aesthete is the transformation of the boring
into the interesting.</p>

<p>
This type of aestheticism is criticized from the point of view of
ethics. It is seen to be emptily self-serving and escapist. It is a
despairing means of avoiding commitment and responsibility. It fails
to acknowledge one&rsquo;s social debt and communal existence. And it
is self-deceiving insofar as it substitutes fantasies for actual
states of affairs.</p>

<p>
But Kierkegaard did not want to abandon aesthetics altogether in favor
of the ethical and the religious. A key concept in the Hegelian
dialectic, which Kierkegaard&rsquo;s pseudonymous authorship parodies,
is <em>Aufhebung</em> (sublation). In Hegel&rsquo;s dialectic, when
contradictory positions are reconciled in a higher unity (synthesis)
they are both annulled and preserved (<em>aufgehoben</em>). Similarly
with Kierkegaard&rsquo;s pseudo-dialectic: the aesthetic and the
ethical are both annulled and preserved in their synthesis in the
religious stage. As far as the aesthetic stage of existence is
concerned what is preserved in the higher religious stage is the sense
of infinite possibility made available through the imagination. But
this no longer excludes what is actual. Nor is it employed for
egotistic ends. Aesthetic irony is transformed into religious humor,
and the aesthetic <em>transfiguration</em> of the actual world into
the ideal is transformed into the religious
<em>transubstantiation</em> of the finite world into an actual
reconciliation with the infinite.</p>

<p>
But the dialectic of the &ldquo;first&rdquo; pseudonymous authorship
never quite reaches the highest, paradoxical form of the religious. We
stop short at the <em>representation</em> of the religious by a
self-confessed humorist (Johannes Climacus) in a medium which,
according to Climacus&rsquo;s own account, necessarily alienates the
reader from true (Christian) faith. For faith is a matter of lived
experience, of constant striving within an individual&rsquo;s
existence. According to Climacus&rsquo;s metaphysics, the world is
divided dualistically into the actual and the ideal. Language (and all
other media of representation) belong to the realm of the ideal. No
matter how eloquent or evocative language is it can never <em>be</em>
the actual. Therefore, any representation of faith is always suspended
in the realm of ideality and can never
<em>be</em> actual faith.</p>

<p>
So the whole dialectic of the &ldquo;first&rdquo; pseudonymous
authorship is recuperated by the aesthetic by virtue of its medium of
representation. In fact Johannes Climacus acknowledges this implicitly
when at the end of
<em>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</em> he <em>revokes</em>
everything he has said, with the important rider that to say something
then to revoke it is not the same as never having said it in the first
place. His presentation of religious faith in an aesthetic medium at
least provides an opportunity for his readers to make their own leap
of faith, by appropriating with inward passion the paradoxical
religion of Christianity into their own lives.</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard also uses aesthetic devices, including pseudonyms, in his
&ldquo;second&rdquo; authorship, that is, those published
after <em>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</em>. These works include
those by Anti-Climacus, who represents the Christian point of
view <em>par excellence</em>, beyond where Kierkegaard placed
himself. Kierkegaard also used many biblical figures and stories with
poignant and striking effect in the religious writings he published
under his own name. As a poet of the religious Kierkegaard was always
preoccupied with aesthetics. In fact, contrary to popular
misconceptions of Kierkegaard which represent him as becoming
increasingly hostile to poetry, he increasingly referred to himself as
a poet in his later years (all but one of over ninety references to
himself as a poet in his journals date from after 1847). Kierkegaard
never claimed to write with religious authority, as an apostle. His
works represent both less religiously enlightened and more religiously
enlightened positions than he thought he had attained in his own
existence. Such representations were only possible in an aesthetic
medium of imagined possibilities like poetry.</p>

<h2><a name="Eth">4. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s Ethics</a></h2>

<p>
Like the terms &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; and &ldquo;religious&rdquo;,
the term &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; in Kierkegaard&rsquo;s work has more
than one meaning. It is used to denote both: (i) a limited existential
sphere, or stage, which is superseded by the higher stage of the
religious life; and (ii) an aspect of life which is retained even
within the religious life. In the first sense &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; is
synonymous with the Hegelian notion of <em>Sittlichkeit</em>, or
customary mores. In this sense &ldquo;ethics&rdquo; represents
&ldquo;the universal&rdquo;, or more accurately the prevailing social
norms. These social norms are used as reasons to make sense of, or
justify, an action within a community. Even human sacrifice is
justified in terms of how it serves the community, so that when
Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter Iphigenia he is regarded as a tragic
hero since his community understands that the sacrifice is required by
the gods for the success of the Greek expedition to Troy (<em>Fear and
Trembling</em>). </p>

<p>
Kierkegaard, however, recognizes duties that cannot be justified in
terms of social norms. Much of <em>Fear and Trembling</em> turns on
the notion that Abraham&rsquo;s would-be sacrifice of his son Isaac is
ineffable in terms of social norms, and requires a &ldquo;teleological
suspension of the ethical&rdquo;. That is, Abraham recognizes a duty
to something higher than both his social duty not to kill an innocent
person and his personal commitment to his beloved son, viz. his duty
to obey God&rsquo;s commands. However, he cannot give an intelligible
ethical justification of his act to the community in terms of social
norms, but must simply obey the divine command.</p>

<p>
But in order to arrive at a position of religious faith, which might
entail a &ldquo;teleological suspension of the ethical&rdquo;, the
individual must first embrace the ethical (in the first sense). In
order to raise oneself beyond the merely aesthetic life, which is a
life of drifting in imagination, possibility and sensation, one needs
to make a commitment. That is, the aesthete needs to choose the
ethical, which entails a commitment to communication and decision
procedures.</p>

<p>
The ethical position advocated by Judge Wilhelm in &ldquo;Equilibrium
Between the Aesthetic and the Ethical in the Composition of
Personality&rdquo; (<em>Either-Or</em> II) is a peculiar mix of
cognitivism and noncognitivism. The metaethics or normative ethics are
cognitivist, laying down various necessary conditions for ethically
correct action. These conditions include: the necessity of choosing
seriously and inwardly; commitment to the belief that predications of
good and evil of our actions have a truth-value; the necessity of
choosing what one is actually doing, rather than just responding to a
situation; actions are to be in accordance with rules; and these rules
are universally applicable to moral agents.</p>

<p>
The choice of metaethics, however, is noncognitive. There is no
adequate proof of the truth of metaethics. The choice of normative
ethics is motivated, but in a noncognitive way. The Judge seeks to
motivate the choice of his normative ethics through the avoidance of
despair. Here despair (<em>Fortvivlelse</em>) is to let one&rsquo;s
life depend on conditions outside one&rsquo;s control (and later, more
radically, despair is the very possibility of despair in this first
sense). For Judge Wilhelm, the choice of normative ethics is a
noncognitive choice of cognitivism, and thereby an acceptance of the
applicability of the conceptual distinction between good and evil.</p>

<p>
From Kierkegaard&rsquo;s religious perspective, however, the
conceptual distinction between good and evil is ultimately dependent
not on social norms but on God. Therefore it is possible, as Johannes
de Silentio argues was the case for Abraham (the father of faith),
that God demand a suspension of the ethical (in the sense of the
socially prescribed norms). This is still ethical in the second sense,
since ultimately God&rsquo;s definition of the distinction between
good and evil outranks any human society&rsquo;s definition. The
requirement of communicability and clear decision procedures can also
be suspended by God&rsquo;s fiat. This renders cases such as
Abraham&rsquo;s extremely problematic, since we have no recourse to
public reason to decide whether he is legitimately obeying God&rsquo;s
command or whether he is a deluded would-be murderer. Since public
reason cannot decide the issue for us, we must decide for ourselves as
a matter of religious faith.</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s ultimate advocacy of divine command metaethics is
tempered somewhat by his detailed analyses of the nuanced ways
individuals need to relate to God&rsquo;s commands. These analyses
amount to a subtle moral psychology, which borders on virtue ethics.
It is not enough simply for God to issue a command; we need to hear
and obey. But obedience is not straightforward. We can obey willingly
or begrudgingly. We can refuse altogether. We can be selectively deaf,
or be so filled with our egotistical desires that we are altogether
deaf to our duties. In order to obey we first need to cultivate faith,
since obedience to a divine command is nonsense unless we at least
believe the command has come from God. To cultivate faith in a
transcendent, eternal, omnipresent God, who allegedly became incarnate
in the form of a particular human being who was put to death, requires
one to overcome the offense to one&rsquo;s reason and to adopt a
tolerance for paradox. To imagine the enormity of the consequences of
sin, yet to relish the possibilities of freedom, engenders anxiety. We
need to learn to navigate the treacherous maelstroms of despair, to
recognize the self-absorption of demonic states, to veer away from
prudence and vanity, and to avoid mere conformity to social mores. We
need to cultivate hope, patience, devotion, and above all love. But we
also need to be vigilant about our capacity for self-deception and be
prepared to suffer for love and for our ultimate spiritual
identity.</p>

<h2><a name="Reli">5. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s Religion</a></h2>

<p>
Kierkegaard styled himself above all as a religious poet. The religion
to which he sought to relate his readers is Christianity. The type of
Christianity that underlies his writings is a very serious strain of
Lutheran pietism informed by the dour values of sin, guilt, suffering,
and individual responsibility. Kierkegaard was immersed in these
values in the family home through his father, whose own childhood was
lived in the shadow of <em>Herrnhut</em> pietism in Jutland.
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s father subsequently became a member of the lay
Congregation of Brothers (<em>Br&oslash;dremenighed</em>) in
Copenhagen, which he and his family attended in addition to the
sermons by Bishop J. P. Mynster.</p>

<p>
For Kierkegaard Christian faith is not a matter of regurgitating
church dogma. It is a matter of individual subjective passion, which
cannot be mediated by the clergy or by human artefacts. Faith is the
most important task to be achieved by a human being, because only on
the basis of faith does an individual have a chance to become a true
self. This self is the life-work which God judges for eternity.</p>

<p>
The individual is thereby subject to an enormous burden of
responsibility, for upon h/er existential choices hangs h/er eternal
salvation or damnation. Anxiety or dread (<em>Angest</em>) is the
presentiment of this terrible responsibility when the individual
stands at the threshold of momentous existential choice. Anxiety is a
two-sided emotion: on one side is the dread burden of choosing for
eternity; on the other side is the exhilaration of freedom in choosing
oneself. Choice occurs in the instant (<em>&Oslash;ieblikket</em>),
which is the point at which time and eternity intersect&mdash;for the
individual creates through temporal choice a self which will be judged
for eternity.</p>

<p>
But the choice of faith is not made once and for all. It is essential
that faith be constantly renewed by means of repeated avowals of
faith. One&rsquo;s very selfhood depends upon this repetition, for
according to Anti-Climacus, the self &ldquo;is a relation which
relates itself to itself&rdquo; (<em>The Sickness Unto Death</em>).
But unless this self acknowledges a &ldquo;power which constituted
it,&rdquo; it falls into a despair which undoes its selfhood.
Therefore, in order to maintain itself as a relation which relates
itself to itself, the self must constantly renew its faith in
&ldquo;the power which posited it.&rdquo; There is no
<em>mediation</em> between the individual self and God by priest or by
logical system (<em>contra</em> Catholicism and Hegelianism
respectively). There is only the individual&rsquo;s own
<em>repetition</em> of faith. This repetition of faith is the way the
self relates itself to itself and to the power which constituted it,
i.e., the repetition of faith <em>is</em> the self.</p>

<p>
Christian dogma, according to Kierkegaard, embodies paradoxes which
are offensive to reason. The central paradox is the assertion that the
eternal, infinite, transcendent God simultaneously became incarnated
as a temporal, finite, human being (Jesus). There are two possible
attitudes we can adopt to this assertion, viz. we can have faith, or
we can take offense. What we cannot do, according to Kierkegaard, is
believe by virtue of reason. If we choose faith we must suspend our
reason in order to believe in something higher than reason. In fact we
must believe <em>by virtue of the absurd</em>.</p>

<p>
Much of Kierkegaard&rsquo;s authorship explores the notion of the
absurd: Job gets everything back again by virtue of the absurd
(<em>Repetition</em>); Abraham gets a reprieve from having to
sacrifice Isaac, by virtue of the absurd (<em>Fear and
Trembling</em>); Kierkegaard hoped to get Regine back again after
breaking off their engagement, by virtue of the absurd
(<em>Journals</em>); Climacus hopes to deceive readers into the truth
of Christianity by virtue of an absurd representation of
Christianity&rsquo;s ineffability; the Christian God is represented as
absolutely transcendent of human categories yet is absurdly presented
as a personal God with the human capacities to love, judge, forgive,
teach, etc. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s notion of the absurd subsequently
became an important category for twentieth century existentialists,
though usually devoid of its religious associations.</p>

<p>
According to Johannes Climacus, faith is a miracle, a gift from God
whereby eternal truth enters time in the instant. This Christian
conception of the relation between (eternal) truth and time is
distinct from the Socratic notion that (eternal) truth is always
already within us&mdash;it just needs to be recovered by means of
recollection (<em>anamnesis</em>). The condition for realizing
(eternal) truth for the Christian is a gift (<em>Gave</em>) from God,
but its realization is a task (<em>Opgave</em>) which must be
repeatedly performed by the individual believer. Whereas Socratic
recollection is a recuperation of the past, Christian repetition is a
&ldquo;recollection forwards&rdquo;&mdash;so that the eternal (future)
truth is captured in time.</p>

<p>
Crucial to the miracle of Christian faith is the realization that over
against God we are always in the wrong. That is, we must realize that
we are always in sin. This is the condition for faith, and must be
given by God. The idea of sin cannot evolve from purely human origins.
Rather, it must have been introduced into the world from a
transcendent source. Once we understand that we are in sin, we can
understand that there is some being over against which we are always
in the wrong. On this basis we can have faith that, by virtue of the
absurd, we can ultimately be atoned with this being. The absurdity of
atonement requires faith that we believe that for God even the
impossible is possible, including the forgiveness of the unforgivable.
If we can accept God&rsquo;s forgiveness, sincerely, inwardly,
contritely, with gratitude and hope, then we open ourselves to the
joyous prospect of beginning anew. The only obstacle to this joy is
our refusal or resistance to accepting God&rsquo;s forgiveness
properly. Although God can forgive the unforgivable, He cannot force
anyone to accept it. Therefore, for Kierkegaard, &ldquo;there is only
one guilt that God cannot forgive, that of not willing to believe in
his greatness!&rdquo;. </p>

<h2><a name="Pol">6. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s Politics</a></h2>

<p>
Kierkegaard is sometimes regarded as an apolitical thinker, but in
fact he intervened stridently in church politics, cultural politics,
and in the turbulent social changes of his time. His earliest
published essay, for example, was a polemic against women&rsquo;s
liberation. It is a reactionary apologetic for the prevailing
patriarchal values, and was motivated largely by Kierkegaard&rsquo;s
desire to ingratiate himself with factions within Copenhagen&rsquo;s
intellectual circles. This latter desire gradually left him, but his
relation to women remained highly questionable. </p>

<p>
One of Kierkegaard&rsquo;s main interventions in cultural politics was
his sustained attack on Hegelianism. Hegel&rsquo;s philosophy had been
introduced into Denmark with religious zeal by J.L. Heiberg, and was
taken up enthusiastically within the theology faculty of Copenhagen
University and by Copenhagen&rsquo;s literati. Kierkegaard, too, was
induced to make a serious study of Hegel&rsquo;s work. While
Kierkegaard greatly admired Hegel, he had grave reservations about
Hegelianism and its bombastic promises. Hegel would have been the
greatest thinker who ever lived, said Kierkegaard, if only he had
regarded his system as a thought-experiment. Instead he took himself
seriously to have reached the truth, and so rendered himself
comical.</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s tactic in undermining Hegelianism was to produce
an elaborate parody of Hegel&rsquo;s entire system. The pseudonymous
authorship, from <em>Either-Or</em> to <em>Concluding Unscientific
Postscript</em>, presents an inverted Hegelian dialectic which is
designed to take away readers&rsquo; presumed knowledge rather than
add to it. This authorship snipes simultaneously at German romanticism
and contemporary Danish literati (with J.L. Heiberg receiving much
acerbic comment). However, it also draws heavily on the work of these
authors, especially by taking seriously their framing of philosophical
and theological problems. For example, Kierkegaard engaged with the
early German romantics&rsquo; notion that modernity is to be
understood primarily by contrast with antiquity, which in turn is to
be understood mainly in terms of classical Greek thought. Classical
Greek art, in particular, is taken to be the gold standard by which
artistic perfection is to be measured. However, Kierkegaard and the
German romantics and German idealists share the view that classical
Greek art lacks inwardness or subjective spirit. Modern art, by
contrast, while unlikely to match the formal perfection of classical
Greek art, contains the potential to explore subjective spirit. One
crucial dimension of subjective spirit is freedom, which becomes a
distinctive preoccupation of modern art and post-Kantian philosophy.
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s concept of individual freedom, ultimately
understood in terms of becoming as nothing before God, engages
critically with the concepts of freedom in Kant, Hegel and Schelling,
as well as with the theologies of Jacobi, Lessing and Schleiermacher.
Kierkegaard presents a distinctive phenomenology of freedom by means
of fictional case studies in a method he calls &ldquo;experimenting
psychology&rdquo;. He uses narrative points of view, pseudonyms,
vignettes, character sketches and case studies from life and
literature to illustrate how dialectics of moods, emotions and spirit
can both disable and enable individual freedom. Moods such as
melancholy, boredom and irony can become demonically
self-perpetuating, but they also have the potential to lift the
individual to a state of self-reflection that amounts to higher order
consciousness, thereby enabling the individual to see his or her
former existence as what Wittgenstein called a limited whole. The
highest order of consciousness for Kierkegaard is God-consciousness,
which enables the individual to see himself or herself as both a
sinner and as open to divine grace. The path to this ultimate freedom
requires will, imagination, faith, love, penitence, patience and a
humble kenosis, whereby the self is emptied of will to become
receptive to God&rsquo;s will.</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s intriguing pseudonymous &ldquo;first
authorship&rdquo;, culminating in <em>Concluding Unscientific
Postscript</em>, received little popular attention, aimed as it was at
the literary elite. So it had little immediate effect as discursive
action. Kierkegaard sought to remedy this by provoking an attack on
himself in the popular satirical review <em>The Corsair</em>.
Kierkegaard succeeded in having himself mercilessly lampooned in this
publication, largely on personal grounds rather than in terms of the
substance of his writings. The suffering incurred by these attacks
sparked Kierkegaard into another highly productive phase of
authorship, but this time his focus was the creation of positive
Christian discourses rather than satire or parody.</p>

<p>
Eventually Kierkegaard became more and more worried about the
direction taken by the Danish People&rsquo;s Church, especially after
the death of the Bishop Primate J.P. Mynster. He realized he could no
longer indulge himself in the painstakingly erudite and poetically
meticulous writing he had practised hitherto. He had to intervene
decisively in a popular medium, so he published his own pamphlet under
the title <em>The Instant</em> or <em>The Moment</em>
(<em>&Oslash;ieblikket</em>). This addressed church politics directly
and increasingly shrilly.</p>

<p>
There were two main foci of Kierkegaard&rsquo;s concern in church
politics. One was the influence of Hegel, largely through the
teachings of H.L. Martensen; the other was the popularity of N.F.S.
Grundtvig, a theologian, educator and poet who composed most of the
pieces in the Danish hymn book. Grundtvig&rsquo;s theology was
diametrically opposed to Kierkegaard&rsquo;s in tone. Grundtvig
emphasized the light, joyous, celebratory and communal aspects of
Christianity, whereas Kierkegaard emphasized seriousness, suffering,
sin, guilt, and individual isolation. Kierkegaard&rsquo;s intervention
failed miserably with respect to the Danish People&rsquo;s Church,
which became predominantly Grundtvigian. His intervention with respect
to Hegelianism also failed, with Martensen succeeding Mynster as
Bishop Primate. Hegelianism in the church went on to die of natural
causes.</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard also provided critical commentary on social change. He was
an untiring champion of &ldquo;the single individual&rdquo; as opposed
to &ldquo;the crowd&rdquo;. He feared that the opportunity of
achieving genuine selfhood was diminished by the social production of
stereotypes. He lived in an age when mass society was emerging from a
highly stratified feudal order and was contemptuous of the mediocrity
the new social order generated. One symptom of the change was that
mass society substitutes detached reflection for engaged passionate
commitment. Yet the latter is crucial for Christian faith and for
authentic selfhood according to Kierkegaard.</p>

<p>
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s real value as a social and political thinker was
not realized until after his death. His pamphleteering achieved little
immediate impact, but his substantial philosophical, literary,
psychological and theological writings have had a lasting effect. Much
of Heidegger&rsquo;s very influential work, <em>Being And Time</em>,
is indebted to Kierkegaard&rsquo;s writings, especially for its
phenomenology of moods and its understanding of the constitutive role
of time in the formation of the subject. Sartre&rsquo;s equally large
tome, <em>Being And Nothingness</em>, in which the freedom of the
individual becomes the primary concept for social and political
explanation, also draws on Kierkegaard. Sartre&rsquo;s associated
notions of authenticity and bad faith, and his assertion that
existence precedes essence, also have Kierkegaardian origins. Adorno,
on the other hand, in his <em>Habilitationsschrift</em>, later
published as <em>Kierkegaard: Construction of the Aesthetic</em>, is
critical of Kierkegaard&rsquo;s politics, though Adorno&rsquo;s
indirect target was Heidegger and existentialism more generally.
Adorno argues that Kierkegaard&rsquo;s philosophy of inwardness
ultimately reflects only the bourgeois interior of his time, and that
Kierkegaard falls into the idealism he sought to escape because, like
the existentialists, he fails to follow a concrete historical
dialectic. This results in Kierkegaard&rsquo;s subject-object
dialectic positing an abstract self as counterweight to the
abstractness of the universal. Kierkegaard thereby fails to understand
the self in terms of its concrete historical situation and, despite
his best intentions, creates a self-contradictory system of existence,
which in turn prepares the ground for Heidegger&rsquo;s ontology.</p>

<p>
Contrary to Adorno&rsquo;s critique, it could be argued that
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s writing evinces an astute social realism, evident
in myriad concrete observations and critical reflections on everyday
life and on institutions such as the church, the press, the democratic
movement and the women&rsquo;s movement. This critical social realism,
along with his deep psychological and philosophical analyses of
contemporary problems, and his concern to address &ldquo;the present
age&rdquo; were taken up by fellow Scandinavians Henrik Ibsen and
August Strindberg. Ibsen and Strindberg, together with Friedrich
Nietzsche, became central icons of the modernism movement in Berlin in
the 1890s. The Danish literary critic Georg Brandes was instrumental
in conjoining these intellectual figures: he had given the first
university lectures on Kierkegaard and on Nietzsche; he had promoted
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s work to Nietzsche and to Strindberg; and he had
put Strindberg in correspondence with Nietzsche. Taking his cue from
Brandes, the Swedish literary critic Ola Hansson subsequently promoted
this conjunction of writers in Berlin itself. Berlin modernism
self-consciously sought to use art as a means of political and social
change. It continued Kierkegaard&rsquo;s concern to use discursive
action for social transformation.</p>

<p>
Many other writers have been inspired by Kierkegaard to tackle
fundamental issues in philosophy, politics, theology and psychology.
One major inspiration has been Kierkegaard&rsquo;s treatment of
Abraham and the sacrifice of Isaac (the Akkedah). Franz Kafka,
Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida have all written extensively in
response, to try to sort out the implications for ethics and faith.
Gabriel Marcel, Lev Shestov, Paul Tillich, Martin Buber, Gyorgy
Lukacs, Karl Barth, Georges Battaille, Rudolf Bultmann, Karl Jaspers,
Michel Henry and John D. Caputo have all been influenced by, or
engaged with, Kierkegaard&rsquo;s Christian existentialism. Carl
Schmitt&rsquo;s political theology uses concepts such as &ldquo;the
decision&rdquo; and &ldquo;the exception&rdquo;, which draw heavily on
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s concepts of &ldquo;the moment&rdquo; and
&ldquo;repetition&rdquo;. Kierkegaard was also an inspiration for the
early Wittgenstein, who reportedly said Kierkegaard was &ldquo;by far
the most profound thinker of the [nineteenth] century. Kierkegaard was
a saint.&rdquo; Subsequent Wittgensteinians, such as Stanley Cavell,
James Conant and Cora Diamond, have all engaged with aspects of
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s work, including how we should understand the
distinction between sense and nonsense in the context of claims about
religious authority and revelation. Alastair MacIntyre&rsquo;s reading
of Kierkegaard in <em>After Virtue</em> and <em>A Short History of
Ethics</em> opened up a vigorous line of inquiry into
Kierkegaard&rsquo;s relevance for ethics in contemporary analytic
philosophy. This has produced quite a debate about the relevance of
Kierkegaard for developing narrative accounts of the self, with
notable contributions by Anthony Rudd, John Davenport, John Lippitt
and Patrick Stokes. Paul Ricoeur and Judith Butler have also been
influenced by Kierkegaard, especially regarding his use of rhetoric
and narrative point of view to critique systematic philosophy.</p>

<p>
It is impossible to give an exhaustive list of the important thinkers
who owe an intellectual or existential debt to Kierkegaard. The
diversity of the writers and thinkers mentioned above nevertheless
testifies to the breadth and depth of his influence, which continues
into the present age.</p>

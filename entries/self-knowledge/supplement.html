<h2><a name="KnowSelf">Knowledge of the Self</a></h2>

<p>
The main entry focused on knowledge of one&rsquo;s own mental states.
Yet &ldquo;self-knowledge&rdquo; can also be used to refer to
knowledge of the self and its nature. Issues about knowledge of the
self include: (1) how it is that one distinguishes oneself from
others, as the object of a self-attribution; (2) whether
self-awareness yields a grasp of the material or non-material nature
of the self; (3) whether self-awareness yields a grasp of one&rsquo;s
personal identity over time; and (4) what sort of self-understanding
is required for rational or free agency. These issues are closely
connected with referential semantics, the mind-body problem, the
metaphysics of personal identity, and moral psychology, respectively.
This section briefly sketches some prominent views about knowledge of
the self arising from debates in these areas.</p>

<h3><a name="Self-Iden">Self-Identification</a></h3>

<p>
In self-attributing a mental state, I recognize the state as mine in
some sense, and my self-attribution partially consists in a reference
to myself. This reference is reflexive, in that I think of myself as
myself and not, e.g., as BG, or as the shortest person in the room.
Nozick (1981) underscores the significance of being able to thus refer
to oneself: &ldquo;To be an I, a self, is to have the capacity for
reflexive self-reference&rdquo;. This raises the question: how is it
that I identify myself, and distinguish myself from others?</p>

<p>
Consider: seeing a flushed red face on film, I might wonder whether
the face I see is mine or my identical twin&rsquo;s, and therefore I
may say, &ldquo;someone is embarrassed, but is it me?&rdquo; Evans
(1982) argues that for some kinds of self-attributions, such a
question will not arise. Adopting a term from Shoemaker (1968), he
describes self-attributions of the relevant type as &ldquo;immune to
error through misidentification&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
None of the following utterances appears to make sense when the first
component expresses knowledge gained in the appropriate way:
&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s legs are crossed, but is it my legs that are
crossed?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Someone is hot and sticky, but is it I who am
hot and sticky?&rdquo;; &ldquo;Someone is being pushed, but is it I
who am being pushed?&rdquo; (Evans 1982: 220&ndash;1)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Evans believes that my immunity to error through misidentification, in
such cases, shows that I identify myself directly in these cases. If
in identifying myself as the one who is hot and sticky, I used some
information beyond the information involved in determining that
someone is hot and sticky, then I could possibly be justified in
believing that someone was hot and sticky but mistaken in thinking
that it was me. Because that scenario doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;make
sense&rdquo;, he thinks, I must recognize myself directly, without any
identifying information.</p>

<p>
Others deny that self-identification is direct, claiming instead that
it occurs by way of some sort of description. For instance, Rovane
argues that, in self-reference, the way one thinks of oneself can be
analyzed as &ldquo;the series of psychologically related intentional
episodes to which this one [the current intentional episode]
belongs&rdquo; (Rovane 1993: 86). While Rovane sees intentional states
as the anchor to self-reference, Howell (2006) provides an alternative
descriptive picture, in which the self is identified through awareness
of an occurrent sensation.</p>

<p>
Proponents of descriptive accounts claim that such accounts can
accommodate the fact that we don&rsquo;t actually err about who it is
that is hot and sticky. For instance, Rovane claims that it is
unsurprising that we are reliable self-identifiers, given that
understanding ourselves and our place in the world is required for
genuine agency. (We return to the issue of agency below.) Still, there
is an important epistemic disagreement between those, like Evans, who
claim that self-reference is &ldquo;identification-free&rdquo;, and
those who claim that we refer to ourselves via a description. The
former maintain that there is, in a real sense, no room for error
about who is hot and sticky, whereas the latter will say that while
such errors are possible, we simply avoid them.</p>

<p>
Notably, both &ldquo;direct reference&rdquo; and descriptive accounts
capture the reflexivity of first-person reference. (For descriptive
accounts, this reflexivity lies in the fact that &ldquo;this
one&rdquo; refers to the very thought of which it is a part.) They
thereby fit with the widely accepted belief that self-reference in the
distinctively first-person mode is essentially indexical. (See
Casta&ntilde;eda 1966; Perry 1979; Lewis 1979.) The dispute between
Evans and Rovane is then, in part, a disagreement as to whether the
indexical term &ldquo;I&rdquo; refers to the self directly, as Evans
believes, or instead refers via an implicit indexical of another sort,
e.g., &ldquo;this&rdquo; or &ldquo;here&rdquo;. In general,
one&rsquo;s epistemology of self-identification will depend on what
sort of indexical one considers most fundamental, in
self-reference.</p>

<p>
A final issue concerns the relation between self-awareness and
awareness of other persons. On the leading traditional view of this
relation, one first grasps that one bears psychological properties,
and reasons by analogy to the conclusion that other creatures do as
well. (This is the &ldquo;argument from analogy&rdquo; to the
existence of other minds, articulated by J.S. Mill (1865).) Some
recent philosophers have challenged this traditional view, contending
that self-awareness is logically dependent on at least a conceptual
grasp of other persons. For instance, here is Berm&uacute;dez:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[A] subject&rsquo;s recognition that he is distinct from the
environment in virtue of being a psychological subject depends on his
ability to identify himself as a psychological subject within a
contrast space of other psychological subjects. (Berm&uacute;dez 1998:
274)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="MatDua">Materialism and Dualism</a></h3>

<p>
In a much-criticized piece of reasoning, Descartes (1641/1984)
contrasts the certainty afforded by introspection with the
dubitability of knowledge of the physical, to show that introspective
objects (thoughts) are ontologically distinct from physical things.
This strategy for supporting dualism has few current proponents.
Commentators still adhere to the basic criticism lodged by Arnauld
(1641/1984): that a purely epistemic premise cannot support an
ontological conclusion. It is clearly possible to be (relatively)
certain that there is water in the tub, while doubting that there is
H<sub>2</sub>O in the tub; yet water is identical to H<sub>2</sub>O.
Many contemporary materialists are similarly concerned to restrict the
deliverances of introspection, arguing that while mental states
appear, to introspection, to be non-physical, the grasp which
introspection affords is partial at best, and systematically
misleading at worst.</p>

<p>
However, there are materialists who take the opposite tack: rather
than rejecting self-reflection as a guide to ontology, they claim that
some mental states appear physical. These arguments employ three types
of self-reflection: introspective awareness of sensations,
introspective awareness of perceptual states, and proprioceptive
awareness of bodily states. Proprioception is the putatively direct,
non-perceptual awareness of one&rsquo;s bodily state; it is what
allows you to know that your arm is raised &ldquo;from the
inside&rdquo;, that is, without looking at your arm.</p>

<p>
The argument for materialism from proprioceptive awareness, due to
Brewer (1995), is as follows. Proprioception is epistemically on a par
with introspective knowledge, in that (i) it is a species of direct,
non-inferential awareness, and (ii) it is &ldquo;immune to error
through misidentification of the first-person pronoun&rdquo; in
Shoemaker&rsquo;s sense.</p>

<p>
Presumably, introspective awareness of mental states justifies the
claim that we are mental beings, by virtue of its epistemic character.
But proprioceptive awareness of physical states shares this epistemic
character; so we are equally justified in the claim that we are
physical beings. This argument falls short of disproving dualism, for
it leaves open the question how our mental nature is related to our
physical nature.</p>

<p>
Brewer (1995) also builds an alternative argument along these lines,
which seeks to rule out dualism by focusing on introspective awareness
of sensations. This argument takes introspective awareness of
sensations as intrinsically mental and, at the same time,
intrinsically physical. Like the previous argument, it claims that
awareness of physical properties is epistemologically equivalent to
awareness of mental properties. But it goes further, contending that
introspection provides an awareness of physical and mental properties,
in sensations, as inextricable. It thus tries to block the possibility
of distinctness between the mental subject and the physical
subject.</p>

<p>
A final argument to show that self-knowledge supports materialism,
advanced by Cassam (1997), uses a somewhat different approach. Rather
than relying on the spatial quality of bodily sensations or
proprioception, this argument exploits one&rsquo;s awareness of
one&rsquo;s own perceptual states. It says that in becoming aware of
our own perceptual states and taking these states to represent a
physical world, we are driven to conceive of ourselves as physical
objects.</p>

<p>
Broadly Cartesian objections to introspection-based arguments for
materialism illuminate possible ways that the ontological conclusion
can be flawed, consistent with the introspective evidence. For
instance, the apparent proprioceptive awareness of the position of
one&rsquo;s limbs could be nonveridical: an amputee might have a
similar sense that her legs are crossed, even if she doesn&rsquo;t, in
fact, have any legs. (This does not violate Evans&rsquo; claim that
such judgments are immune to error through misidentification: the
error here is not one of misidentifying the subject, but instead of
falsely ascribing a property to the self.) A similar argument could be
made against the claim that sensations are intrinsically spatial, and
that perceptual states represent a physical world. Even if one&rsquo;s
sensations portray oneself as spatially extended, the idea that one is
non-extended (immaterial) is logically consistent with the presence of
those sensations or (apparent) perceptual states. Proponents of these
arguments for materialism could respond by claiming either that
knowledge of oneself as a mental thing is less certain than this
alleged contrast implies, or that knowledge of oneself as a physical
thing is more certain than it implies.</p>

<h3><a name="PerIde">Personal Identity</a></h3>

<p>
The ontological views described in the previous subsection have no
immediate consequences for personal identity. For it may be that the
criteria of persistence through time, for persons, differ from the
criteria of persistence for (other) material objects even if, as
materialists contend, a person at a time is necessarily constituted by
some matter or other. (See the entry on
 <a href="../identity-personal/index.html">personal identity</a>.)
 Knowledge of mental states is not usually thought to provide any
special insight into one&rsquo;s persistence through time, since it is
typically assumed that one enjoys privileged access only to
one&rsquo;s current states. In particular, the individual has no
special insight into whether her current apparent memories are
veridical, and so has no special way to determine whether a particular
prior experience was hers. Since views about first-person access
played a greater part in shaping theories of personal identity during
the modern period than they do today, my brief remarks here will focus
on that period.</p>

<p>
As mentioned above, Descartes&rsquo; meditator uses the proposition
that there is thinking occurring, to which she purportedly has
immediate (indubitable) introspective access, to establish her own
existence with certainty. But this does not allow the meditator to
grasp a persisting self. For Descartes, the self, like every other
substance, is not directly apprehended; it is understood only through
its properties.</p>

<p>
Hume also claims that we never directly apprehend the self. Unlike
Descartes, he concludes from this that there is no substantial self.
In a famous passage, Hume uses introspective awareness to show that
the self is a non-substantial &ldquo;bundle&rdquo; of perceptions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call
<em>myself</em>, I always stumble on some particular perception or
other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or
pleasure. I can never catch <em>myself</em> at any time without a
perception, and can never observe anything but the perception. When my
perceptions are remov&rsquo;d for any time, as by sound sleep; so long
am I insensible of <em>myself</em>, and may truly be said not to
exist. (Hume 1739&ndash;40/1978: 252)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke agrees that self-reflection is important to the nature of the
self. But while Descartes takes self-reflection to <em>reveal</em>
that nature, Locke seems to suggest that one&rsquo;s self-conception
<em>constitutes</em> the self.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[A person is] a thinking intelligent Being, that has reason and
reflection, <em>and considers itself as itself</em>, the same thinking
thing in different times and places. (Locke 1689/1975: II.27.ix, my
emphasis).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On some interpretations, what it is for an experience or action to
belong to <em>me</em> (a Lockean person) is for me to appropriate it,
or to impute it to myself (Winkler 1991). This interpretation
underscores the importance of Locke&rsquo;s claim that
&ldquo;person&rdquo; is a forensic term.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Person&rdquo;&hellip;is a forensic term, appropriating actions
and their merit; and so belongs only to intelligent agents, capable of
a law, and happiness, and misery. This personality extends itself
beyond present existence to what is past, only by consciousness,-
whereby it becomes concerned and accountable; owns and imputes to
itself past actions, just upon the same ground and for the same reason
as it does the present. (Locke 1689/1975: II.27.xxvi)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s view of the self is usually considered less deflationary
than Hume&rsquo;s view. But these philosophers agree that, in a very
real sense, the nature of the self is bound up with one&rsquo;s
reflections on one&rsquo;s states. For Hume, this means that the self
is nothing over and above a constantly varying bundle of experiences.
For Locke, it means that the self is defined by what we do&mdash;or,
perhaps, <em>can</em>&mdash;self-attribute, through recollection
and/or appropriation.</p>

<p>
Kant repudiates the basic strategy shared by Locke and Hume, for he
denies that self-awareness reveals objective facts about personal
identity. He concurs with Descartes and Hume that we never directly
apprehend the self (this fact is what he calls &ldquo;the systematic
elusiveness of the &lsquo;I&rsquo;&rdquo;). And while he holds that we
cannot avoid thinking of ourselves as persisting, unitary beings, he
attributes this self-conception to necessary requirements for thought
which do not directly support substantive ontological conclusions
about the nature of the self.</p>

<p>
A couple of contemporary views about personal identity are noteworthy
in this context. Galen Strawson&rsquo;s (1997) view does not
explicitly draw on introspective reflection, but it implies that the
limits of a subject correspond to the limits of what could be
introspectively grasped, at a moment. A subject is defined by (indeed,
identified with) a period of experience which is &ldquo;experientially
unitary&rdquo;. Since in humans an appropriately unified experience
lasts no more than about three seconds, subjects are in fact very
short-lived. Dainton and Bayne (2005) present a related view, which
tries to avoid the result that subjects are very short-lived. On this
view, personal identity is tied to (the capacity for) experiential
<em>continuity</em> rather than experiential unity. But unlike
Strawson&rsquo;s view, the continuity view is vulnerable to familiar
objections concerning the possibility of branching streams of
consciousness or &ldquo;fission&rdquo;.</p>

<h3><a name="Agency">Agency</a></h3>

<p>
The role of self-understanding in agency is a complex topic, and we
can only briefly examine some leading positions on the issue here.
Knowledge of one&rsquo;s relatively stable traits and
dispositions&mdash;one&rsquo;s character&mdash;is believed, by some,
to be crucial for the exercise of free agency. For instance, Taylor
claims that self-reflection is imperative for being human (where this
means, in part, being capable of agency),</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he human animal not only finds himself impelled from time to time
to interpret himself and his goals, but &hellip; he is always already
in some interpretation, constituted as human by this fact. (Taylor
1985: 75)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In a somewhat different vein, Frankfurt maintains that the capacity to
rationally evaluate one&rsquo;s desires is required for freedom of the
will. This rational evaluation issues in second-order desires, that
is, desires concerning which desires to have or to act upon.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[N]o animal other than man &hellip; appears to have the capacity for
reflective self-evaluation that is manifested in the formation of
second-order desires. (Frankfurt 1971: 7)</p>

<p>
It is only because a person has volitions of the second order that he
is capable both of enjoying and of lacking freedom of the will. (1971:
14)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These claims by Taylor and Frankfurt go beyond the merely pragmatic
observation that a reasonable degree of self-understanding is required
for effective action. Instead, they assert that what is distinctive
about the exercise of a free will, in determining one&rsquo;s course
of action, is that this exercise involves the capacity to critically
reflect on one&rsquo;s basic goals and desires. (For a related recent
view, see Bilgrami 2006.)</p>

<p>
While Taylor, Frankfurt, and Bilgrami stress that a broad
self-understanding is crucial for responsible agency, others claim
that particular actions require some awareness of one&rsquo;s
intentions in performing that action. For instance, Searle (1983)
argues that intentions are always self-referential, in that when one
performs an action <em>X</em> intentionally, the relevant intention to
act includes an intention to <em>X</em> so as to fulfill that
intention itself. Anscombe (1981) similarly emphasizes the
significance of one&rsquo;s awareness of intentions in acting. In
fact, on her view thoughts about actions, intentions, postures, etc.
have a special status: it is only thoughts about such aspects of the
self that are</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
unmediated, non-observational, and also are descriptions (e.g.,
&ldquo;standing&rdquo;) which are directly verifiable or falsifiable
about the person. (Anscombe 1981: 35)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And she also believes that action requires some awareness of these
features of oneself. For criticism of the idea that action requires
awareness of intention, see Cunning (1999).</p>

<p>
One contemporary theory of practical reasoning, offered by Velleman
(1989), casts knowledge of the self in a particularly important role.
Velleman notes that we strongly desire to understand ourselves and, in
particular, to understand our reasons for acting. On his view, this
desire leads us to try to discern our action-motivating desires and
beliefs. (He calls this attempt to gain self-awareness
&ldquo;reflective theoretical reasoning&rdquo;.) But strikingly,
Velleman thinks that the desire for self-understanding also leads us
to model our actions on our predictions about how we will act. In this
way, our expectations as to how we will act are themselves intentions
to act. &ldquo;Intentions to act &hellip; are the expectations of
acting that issue from reflective theoretical reasoning&rdquo;
(Velleman 1989: 98). Thus, Velleman can say that our desire to
understand what we are doing, at the moment we are doing it, is
usually satisfied, since our predictions about how we will act are
themselves intentions to act, and hence our beliefs about what we will
do are &ldquo;self-fulfilling expectations&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Finally, there is an emerging literature which examine the effect of
societal influences on subjects&rsquo; self-understanding and,
thereby, on agency. See, e.g., Neisser and Jopling 1997 and Meyers
2002.</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Reductionism in Biology</a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>
 James Griesemer (2000, 2002, 2011) argues that scientists deploy a
heuristic use of reduction in attempts to relate different theories
and models to one another. Although this account is clearly
methodological, it does not focus on how scientists discover molecular
mechanisms or develop reductive explanations of wholes in terms of
parts. Thus, it is distinct from the sense of methodological
reductionism used here.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>
 The issue of reduction has played a substantial role in both
 <a href="../scientific-reduction/index.html#ModSciRedMin">philosophy of mind</a>
 and philosophy of social science. In the former, a central question
is whether and in what sense mental phenomena can be reduced to
physical phenomena. Philosophers of mind have developed sophisticated
accounts that concentrate on ontological reduction and mereological
constitution (e.g.,
 <a href="../supervenience/index.html">supervenience</a>;
 see Kim 1998, 2005). In philosophy of social science, key questions
include whether social phenomena can be explained solely in terms of
the interactions of individuals, whether different fields of social
science can be reduced to economics, and whether social science as a
whole can be reduced to one or more of the natural sciences (Kincaid
1997). Regardless of whether reduction is considered within philosophy
of biology, mind, or social science, similar ideas and arguments have
been used in these different fields (e.g., multiple realization; see
 <a href="index-2.html#MultRealHighLeveFeatManyOne">Section 4.2</a>).</p>
 
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>
 &ldquo;Let us now, if you please, imagine that a small worm lives in
the blood, whose sight is keen enough to distinguish the particles of
blood, lymph, etc., and his reason to observe how each part on
collision with another either rebounds, or communicates a part of its
own motion, etc. That worm would live in this blood as we live in this
part of the universe, and he would consider each particle of blood to
be a whole, and not a part. And he could not know how all the parts
are controlled by the universal nature of blood, and are forced, as
the universal nature of blood demands, to adapt themselves to one
another, so as to harmonize with one another in a certain way. For if
we imagine that there are no causes outside the blood to communicate
new motions to the blood, and that outside the blood there is no
space, and no other bodies, to which the particles of blood could
transfer their motion, it is certain that the blood would remain
always in its state, and its particles would suffer no changes other
than those which can be conceived from the given relation of the
motion of the blood to the lymph and chyle, etc., and so blood would
have to considered always to be a whole and not a part. But, since
there are very many other causes which in a certain way control the
laws of the nature of blood, and are in turn controlled by the blood,
hence it comes about that other motions and other changes take place
in the blood, which result not only from the mere relation of the
motion of its parts to one another, but from the relation of the
motion of the blood and also of the external causes to one another: in
this way the blood has the character of a part and not of a whole.
&hellip; all the bodies of nature can and should be conceived in the
same way as we have here conceived the blood&rdquo; (Spinoza to
Oldenburg, Letter 32; Wolf 1966, 210-211).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>
 &ldquo;Now it is true that the ultimate elements of organized matter
are precisely those which enter into the composition of Unorganized
substances: But by the operation of a power, distinct from
Gravitation, molecular attraction, or any of the known imponderable
agents which operate on unorganized substances, these elements assume
combinations of a character essentially different from those which are
the result of ordinary chemical affinities&rdquo; (Owen, Hunterian
Lectures [1837] in Sloan 1992, 209).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>
 The mid-twentieth century separation of discussions about relations
between domains of science (Nagelian <em>theory</em> reduction) and
relations between parts and wholes in biology (<em>explanatory</em>
reduction) is concretely visible in David Hull&rsquo;s <em>Philosophy
of Biological Science</em> (1974). Chapter 1 is a justly famous
discussion regarding the difficulties of effecting theory reduction
between classical and molecular genetics, but chapter 5,
&ldquo;Organicism and Reductionism&rdquo;, has been relatively
neglected. It includes a very different set of themes, including
vitalism, biological organization and complexity, and the relations
between parts and wholes in living systems.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>
 Rosenberg&rsquo;s argument contains several controversial premises,
such as the need for strict laws in biological explanation and the
distinction between molecular and functional biology (for criticisms,
see Kaiser 2015, chap. 4&ndash;5, Love 2007, Love et al. 2008). The
intersection of natural selection and molecular biology in the context
of explanatory reductionism has been explored by Sarkar (2005 [1991])
with much less optimism.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
 E.g., &ldquo;cellular context is important when deciphering how EGF
[epidermal growth factor] interacts with EGFR [epidermal growth factor
receptor]. From a general perspective, care is advisable when
generalizing ligand-receptor interaction results across multiple
cell-lines&rdquo; (Bj&ouml;rkelund et al. 2011, 1). Also,
&ldquo;Agents binding to the enzyme catalysing the reaction may
influence this Michaelis constant [describing the enzyme&rsquo;s
reaction kinetics] &hellip; All components of the same living cell may
therewith affect the role the enzyme plays in the cell&rsquo;s
behaviour, including the components that are not yet known&rdquo;
(Westerhoff and Kell 2007, 37&ndash;38).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>
 In the debate about the relations between classical and molecular
genetics, Philip Gasper (1992) dubs this &ldquo;multiple
supervenience&rdquo; in order to contrast it with multiple
realization. A different way to make a similar point is that
biological entities and processes (including molecular ones) often
possess their causal properties <em>extrinsically </em>(i.e., due to
features external to the bearer of the property). For example, a
particular segment of DNA is a gene as a consequence of its ability to
code for a functional product, which depends on both DNA elements
external to this gene and non-genetic factors. Therefore, being a gene
is a property of a DNA segment, but an extrinsic one.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>
 The derivation demanded by theory reduction for molecular biology
requires that the premises contain a purely molecular specification of
the total context. Although Nagel and Schaffner have explicated the
notion of theory reduction, they have not shown how to effect the
molecular deduction. Even Schaffner&rsquo;s most detailed defense of
reduction (Schaffner 1993) focuses on the condition of connectability,
giving a partial account of how to relate the <em>predicate</em>
&ldquo;dominance&rdquo; used in classical genetics to expressions from
biochemistry. However, he does not give a single example of a higher
level <em>statement</em> being deducible from some lower level theory;
and theory reduction requires that the <em>condition of
derivability</em> be met. Debate over Schaffner&rsquo;s model has
focused primarily on the condition of connectability, especially
whether a molecular characterization of the notion of a classical gene
is possible. Yet as Hull (1974) made plain, a critic of theory
reduction needs no more than an argument against connectability as a
<em>necessary</em> condition on reduction, while a reductionist has to
defend derivability over and above connectability.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>
 One of Schaffner&rsquo;s replies to Hull regarding the one-many
objection is that the molecular context of a mechanism can be included
in the premises to the extent that it matters. Wimsatt (1976a) rightly
points out that stressing the inclusion of context will always rely on
how mechanisms are individuated (H&uuml;ttemann and Love 2011; see
 <a href="index-2.html#ReprTempIntr">Section 4.3</a>).
 Schaffner&rsquo;s move to include the total context implies that any
two possible situations will have distinct overall molecular
configurations, but others view this as the same mechanism in
different contexts. Generality requires treating parts of different
particular molecular configurations as instantiating the same type of
mechanism. A consequence of this need for generality is that the same
type of mechanism can occur in different contexts, possibly with a
different effect. This sense of one&ndash;many relations between
molecular and higher level kinds does not necessarily preclude some
types of reduction, but explanations in molecular biology must to be
sensitive to the associated epistemic issues.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>
 Higher level laws can have exceptions: e.g., if
<em>M</em><sub><em>d</em></sub>, one of the molecular kinds realizing
<em>S</em>, does not cause any of the realizers
<em>N</em><sub>1</sub>, &hellip;, <em>N</em><sub><em>j</em></sub> of
<em>T</em>. Waters (1990) has argued that explaining such an exception
requires an appeal to the molecular level detail and therefore is a
form of reductionism. This contrasts with Fodor (1974) who argued that
a reductionist approach encourages eliminating the higher level
generality in favor of exceptionless lower level laws. But scientists
often accept higher level laws despite exceptions that require appeal
to the molecular level precisely because they aim to address both the
higher and lower level situations.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>
 The notions of multiple realization and supervenience were originally
developed in philosophy of mind as part of a non-reductive physicalism
about mental phenomena. Whether these concepts offer an adequate
account of the relation between mental and physical phenomena has been
questioned (Kim 1992, 1998). The status of multiple realization in
philosophy is currently a subject of debate and may hinge on certain
metaphysical commitments about the concept of realization (Gillett
2002, 2003, 2010). &ldquo;Realization&rdquo; takes on different roles
in scientific and philosophical discussions (Wilson and Craver 2007)
and the significance of these differences has not yet been analyzed
for the situations of multiple realization frequently discussed in
philosophy of biology (but see Gillett 2016). Biological examples used
in these philosophical discussions, such as eyes, have often not been
treated with adequate care and precision (Couch 2005, 2009).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>
 &ldquo;Out of over 1 million animal species, modern developmental
biology has focused on a very small number which are often described
as &lsquo;model organisms.&rsquo; This is because the motivation for
their study is not simply to understand how that particular animal
develops, but to use it as an example of how all animals
develop&rdquo; (Slack 2006, 61).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>
 A less common objection concerns whether the domains being
reductively related are actually distinct. For example, Russell Vance
(1996) has argued against the premise that classical genetics and
molecular genetics are separate fields or theories (e.g.,
&ldquo;genetics is the area of biological science that seems most
immediately amenable to the philosopher&rsquo;s conception of
scientific reduction. The main reason for this is that in genetics
there are two clearly identifiable theories, bodies of law,
expressions of regularity &ndash; one molecular and one
nonmolecular&rdquo; [Rosenberg 1985, 90]). While this undermines
global attempts at reductively relating classical genetics and
molecular genetics, and modulates how to understand local explanatory
reductions, its more general impact can be understood as a caution
against presuming that two areas of biology are distinct in practice
or distinguishable in principle (as is often done in theory
reduction). One cannot simply assume an individuation of the epistemic
units being related reductively.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>
 For example, some explanations in developmental biology appear to
rely on temporal representations that are not keyed to the temporal
organization of mechanisms (e.g.,
 <a href="../biology-developmental/index.html#NorStaPhePla">normal stages</a>).
 If so, the issue of
 <a href="../biology-developmental/index.html#IntAppGenPhy">temporality in explanations cannot be reduced</a>
 to the issue of temporality in a mechanism. Additionally, qualitative
change in ontogeny, where novel structures emerge out of distinct
developmental precursors, does not appear straightforwardly amenable
to a mechanisms approach. &ldquo;Mechanism&rdquo; also has been
advocated by those discussing reductionism in the context of
evolutionary biology (Brandon 1996).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>
 E.g.: &ldquo;The heart provides an excellent example both of the huge
advances that have been made using the reductive approach and of the
severe limits of this approach&rdquo; (Noble 1998, 56); &ldquo;Our
results suggest that the cellular responses induced by multiplex
protein kinase inhibitors may be an emergent property that cannot be
understood fully considering only the sum of individual
inhibitor-kinase interactions&rdquo; (Kung et al. 2005, 3587);
&ldquo;Our results therefore point to the need to consider each
complex biological network as a whole, instead of focusing on local
properties&rdquo; (Guimer&agrave; and Nunes Amaral 2005, 899);
&ldquo;Robustness &hellip; is one of the fundamental and ubiquitously
observed systems-level phenomena that cannot be understood by looking
at individual components&rdquo; (Kitano 2004, 826); &ldquo;The
molecular reductionism that dominated twentieth-century biology will
be superseded by an interdisciplinary approach that embraces
collective phenomena&rdquo; (Goldenfeld and Woese 2007, 369);
&ldquo;Understanding the dynamics of infectious-disease transmission
demands a holistic approach, yet today&rsquo;s models largely ignore
how epidemics change individual behaviour&rdquo; (Ferguson 2007, 733);
&ldquo;The collective behaviour of matter can give rise to startling
emergent properties that hint at the nexus between biology and
physics&rdquo; (Coleman 2007, 379); &ldquo;After several decades
dominated by reductionist approaches in biology, researchers are
returning to the study of complex biology with a litany of new and old
techniques&rdquo; (Hogenesch and Ueda 2011, 407). Noble (2006)
represents a book-length treatment in this vein.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>
 &ldquo;The formalization of supervenience employed here is the
application of one due to Jaegwon Kim&rdquo; (Rosenberg 1978, 373).
Referring to Kim&rsquo;s paper &ldquo;Nomological
Incommensurables&rdquo; (read at Oberlin Colloquium in 1977),
Rosenberg continues in a footnote: &ldquo;My debts to this paper are
by no means limited to its account of supervenience. In fact, the
whole perspective adopted here with respect to the relation between
theories involved in reduction, and the bearing of causal and
mereological determinism on this relation are inspired by this paper.
&hellip; The reader is referred to Kim&rsquo;s paper for a fuller
account of supervenience and its role in ethics, aesthetics, and the
philosophy of mind in general.&rdquo;</p>

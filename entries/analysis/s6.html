<h3><a name="1">1. Introduction to Supplement</a></h3>

<p>

This supplement provides an account of the development of conceptions
of analysis in analytic philosophy. The emergence of logical analysis
as the distinctive form of analysis in early analytic philosophy is 
outlined in 
 <a href="index-2.html#6">&sect;6</a>
 of the main document.</p>

<p>


 <a href="bib6.html#6.1">Annotated Bibliography, &sect;6.1</a>
 </p>

<h3><a name="2">2. Frege</a></h3>

<p>

Although Frege&rsquo;s work shows the enormous potential of logical 
analysis, it is not incompatible with other forms of analysis. 
Indeed, its whole point would seem to be to prepare the way for these
other forms, as philosophers in the second phase of analytic 
philosophy came to argue (see 
 <a href="#6">The Cambridge School of Analysis</a>).
 One such form is traditional decompositional 
analysis&mdash;understood, more specifically, as resolving a whole 
into its parts (e.g., a &lsquo;thought&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;proposition&rsquo; into its &lsquo;constituents&rsquo;). 
Decompositional analysis does indeed play a role in Frege&rsquo;s 
philosophy, but what is of greater significance is Frege&rsquo;s use 
of function-argument analysis, which operates in some tension to 
whole-part analysis.</p>

<p>

In developing his logic in his first book, the 
<em>Begriffsschrift</em>, Frege&rsquo;s key move was to represent 
simple statements such as &lsquo;Socrates is mortal&rsquo; not in 
subject-predicate form (&lsquo;<em>S</em> is <em>P</em>&rsquo;, i.e.,
analyzing it into subject and predicate joined by the copula) but in 
function-argument form (&lsquo;<em>Fa</em>&rsquo;)&mdash;taking 
&lsquo;Socrates&rsquo; as the argument and &lsquo;<em>x</em> is 
mortal&rsquo; as the function, which yields as value what Frege calls
the &lsquo;judgeable content&rsquo; of the statement when the 
argument indicated by the variable &lsquo;<em>x</em>&rsquo; is filled
by the name &lsquo;Socrates&rsquo;. (I gloss over here the 
controversial issue as to how Frege understands functions, arguments 
and judgeable contents at this particular time. In his later work, he
regards the result of &lsquo;saturating&rsquo; a concept by an object
as a truth-value.) It was this that allowed him to develop 
quantificational theory, enabling him to analyze complex mathematical
statements.</p>

<p>

To appreciate some of the philosophical implications of 
function-argument analysis, consider the example that Frege gives in 
the <em>Begriffsschrift</em> (&sect;9):</p>

<blockquote>(HLC) Hydrogen is lighter than carbon dioxide.</blockquote>

<p>

According to Frege, this can be analyzed in either of two ways, 
depending on whether we take hydrogen as the argument and <em>is 
lighter than carbon dioxide</em> as the function, or carbon dioxide 
as the argument and <em>is heavier than hydrogen</em> as the 
function. If we respected subject-predicate position, we might wish 
to express the latter thus:</p>

<blockquote>(CHH) Carbon dioxide is heavier than hydrogen.</blockquote>

<p>

But on Frege&rsquo;s view, (HLC) and (CHH) have the same 
&lsquo;content&rsquo; (&lsquo;Inhalt&rsquo;), each merely 
representing alternative ways of &lsquo;analyzing&rsquo; that 
content. There does seem to be something that (HLC) and (CHH) have in
common, and function-argument analysis seems to permit alternative 
analyses of one and the same thing, since two different functions 
with different arguments can yield the same value.</p>

<p>

However, in response to this, it might be suggested that both these 
analyses presuppose a more ultimate one, which identifies <em>two 
arguments</em>, hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and a <em>relation</em> 
(a function with two arguments). Michael Dummett (1981b, ch. 17), for
example, has suggested that we distinguish between <em>analysis</em> 
and <em>decomposition</em>: there can be alternative decompositions, 
into &lsquo;component&rsquo; concepts, but only one analysis, into 
unique &lsquo;constituents&rsquo;. (By &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; Dummett
means what has here been called &lsquo;decomposition&rsquo;, 
which&mdash;<em>pace</em> Dummett&mdash;seems to imply a unique 
end-product far more than &lsquo;analysis&rsquo;, and by 
&lsquo;decomposition&rsquo; Dummett means function-argument 
analysis.) But which relation do we then choose, <em>is lighter 
than</em> or <em>is heavier than</em>? Clearly they are not the same,
since one is the converse of the other. So if we accept that (HLC) 
and (CHH) have the same &lsquo;content&rsquo;&mdash;and there is 
undoubtedly something that they have in common&mdash;then it seems 
that there can be alternative analyses even at the supposedly 
ultimate level.</p>

<p>

The issue, however, is controversial, and leads us quickly into the 
deepest problems in Frege&rsquo;s philosophy, concerning the criteria
for sameness of &lsquo;content&rsquo; (and of 
&lsquo;<em>Sinn</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>Bedeutung</em>&rsquo;, 
into which &lsquo;content&rsquo; later bifurcated), the fruitfulness 
of definitions, and the relationship between Frege&rsquo;s context 
principle and compositionality. For discussion, see Baker and Hacker 
1984, ch. 6; Beaney 1996, ch. 8; 2007d; Bell 1987, 1996; 
Berm&uacute;dez 2001; Currie 1985; Dummett 1981b, ch. 15; 1989;

<h3><a name="3">3. Russell</a></h3>

<p>

In <em>My Philosophical Development</em>, Russell wrote: &ldquo;Ever 
since I abandoned the philosophy of Kant and Hegel, I have sought 
solutions of philosophical problems by means of analysis; and I 
remain firmly persuaded, in spite of some modern tendencies to the 
contrary, that only by analysing is progress possible&rdquo; 
(<em>MPD</em>, 11). Similar remarks are made elsewhere (cf. e.g. 
<em>POM</em>, 3; <em>IMP</em>, 1-2; <em>PLA</em>, 189 
 [<a href="s1.html#Russell">Quotations</a>]).
 Unfortunately, however, Russell never spells out just what he means 
by &lsquo;analysis&rsquo;&mdash;or rather, if we piece together his 
scattered remarks on analysis, they by no means reflect his actual 
practice. In a paper entitled &lsquo;The Regressive Method of 
Discovering the Premises of Mathematics&rsquo;, dating from 1907, for
example, Russell talks of &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; in the regressive 
sense, i.e., as the process of working back to &lsquo;ultimate 
logical premises&rsquo;, and this as an inductive rather than 
deductive process. In the chapter on analysis and synthesis in his 
abandoned 1913 manuscript, <em>Theory of Knowledge</em>, on the other
hand, he defines &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; as &ldquo;the discovery of 
the constituents and the manner of combination of a given 
complex&rdquo; (<em>TK</em>, 119 
 [<a href="s1.html#RussellTK">Quotation</a>]).
 This best captures Russell&rsquo;s &lsquo;official&rsquo; view, and 
decompositional analysis undoubtedly played a major role in 
Russell&rsquo;s thought (cf. Hylton 1996; Beaney 2007a). Yet as 
suggested in 
 <a href="index-2.html#6">&sect;6</a>
 of the main document, what characterizes the founding by Frege and 
Russell of (at least one central strand in) the analytic movement was
the use made of logical analysis, in which a crucial element was the 
formalization of ordinary language statements into a logical 
language.</p>

<p>

It was logical analysis that was involved in Russell&rsquo;s 
celebrated theory of descriptions, first presented in &lsquo;On 
Denoting&rsquo; in 1905, which Ramsey called a &lsquo;paradigm of 
philosophy&rsquo; and which played a major role in the establishment 
of analytic philosophy. In this theory, (Ka) is rephrased as (Kb), 
which can then be readily formalized in the new logic as (Kc):</p>

<blockquote>(Ka) The present King of France is bald. 

<p>

(Kb) There is one and only one King of France, and whatever is King 
of France is bald.</p>

<p>

(Kc) 
 &exist;<em>x</em>[<em>Kx</em>
 &amp; 
 &forall;<em>y</em>(<em>Ky</em>
 &rarr; <em>y</em> = <em>x</em>) &amp; <em>Bx</em>].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

The problems generated by attempting to analyze (Ka) 
<em>decompositionally</em> disappear in this analysis. 
Russell&rsquo;s problem was this: if there is no King of France, then
the subject term in (Ka)&mdash;the definite description &lsquo;the 
present King of France&rsquo;&mdash;would seem to lack a meaning, in 
which case how could the whole have a meaning? Russell solved this 
problem by &lsquo;analyzing away&rsquo; the definite description. The
definite description has no meaning in itself, but (Ka) as a whole 
does have a meaning, a meaning that is given by (Kb), to which (Ka) 
is seen as equivalent. The meaning of (Kb) has still to be explained,
but this can be done by drawing on the resources of the logical 
theory, in which the logical constants and quantificational structure
revealed in (Kc) are clarified.</p>

<p>

Just as Frege provided a diagnosis of what is wrong with the 
ontological argument, at least in its traditional form (see 
 <a href="index-2.html#6">&sect;6</a>
 of the main entry), so Russell showed how to avoid unnecessary 
reification of the purported objects of our discourse. If we can find
an equivalent to a statement involving some problematic expression, 
then the problems drop away in the very process of 
&lsquo;translating&rsquo; it into a logical language. Although Frege 
himself seems not to have fully appreciated the eliminativist 
possibilities opened up by this strategy of logical analysis, Russell
clearly did, and in the process initiated a reductionist programme 
that has been influential ever since. Although, as Russell and 
Whitehead acknowledge in their preface to <em>Principia 
Mathematica</em>, &ldquo;In all questions of logical analysis, our 
chief debt is to Frege&rdquo; (<em>PM</em>, viii), Russell&rsquo;s 
own advance lay in extending logical analysis and in suggesting the 
possibilities of eliminativism.</p>

<p>

its development, see Griffin 1996; Hylton 1990, ch. 6; 2003; 2007;

 </p>

<h3><a name="4">4. Moore</a></h3>

<p>

Moore is generally regarded as one of the founders of analytic 
philosophy, yet his own early conception of analysis is surprisingly 
traditional. In &lsquo;The Nature of Judgement&rsquo;, published in 
1899, he sees analysis simply as the decomposition of complex 
concepts (which is what propositions were for Moore at the time) into
their constituents: &ldquo;A thing becomes intelligible first when it
is analysed into its constituent concepts&rdquo; (<em>NJ</em>, 8 
 [<a href="s1.html#MooreNJ">Quotation</a>]).
 This conception underlies the main theses of Moore&rsquo;s first 
major work, <em>Principia Ethica</em> (1903), including his famous 
&lsquo;open question&rsquo; argument.</p>

<p>

In the first chapter, entitled &lsquo;The Subject-Matter of 
Ethics&rsquo;, Moore considers how &lsquo;good&rsquo; is to be 
defined. By &lsquo;definition&rsquo; here Moore means 
&lsquo;real&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;nominal&rsquo; definition, 
concerned not with the meaning of a word but with the nature of the 
object denoted (cf. <em>PE</em>, 6). He comes to the conclusion that 
&lsquo;good&rsquo; is indefinable, since good has no parts into which
it can be decomposed:</p>

<blockquote>My point is that &lsquo;good&rsquo; is a simple notion,
just as &lsquo;yellow&rsquo; is a simple notion; that, just as you
cannot, by any manner of means, explain to any one who does not already
know it, what yellow is, so you cannot explain what good is.
Definitions of the kind that I was asking for, definitions which
describe the real nature of the object or notion denoted by a word, and
which do not merely tell us what the word is used to mean, are only
possible when the object or notion in question is something complex.
You can give a definition of a horse, because a horse has many
different properties and qualities, all of which you can enumerate. But
when you have enumerated them all, when you have reduced a horse to his
simplest terms, then you no longer define those terms. They are simply
something which you think of or perceive, and to any one who cannot
think of or perceive them, you can never, by any definition, make their
nature known. (<em>PE</em>, 7.)</blockquote>

<p>

Insofar as something is complex, according to Moore, it can be 
&lsquo;defined&rsquo; in terms of its component parts, and, unless we
are to go on <em>ad infinitum</em>, we must eventually reach simple 
parts, which cannot themselves be defined (<em>PE</em>, 7-8). Since 
&lsquo;good&rsquo;, like &lsquo;yellow&rsquo;, is not a complex 
notion, it is indefinable.</p>

<p>

Moore&rsquo;s &lsquo;open question&rsquo; argument is then offered to
support his claim that &lsquo;good&rsquo; is indefinable. Consider a 
proposed definition of the form:</p>

<blockquote>(G) The Good is <em>X</em>.</blockquote>

<p>

(Suggested candidates for &lsquo;<em>X</em>&rsquo; might be 
&lsquo;that which causes pleasure&rsquo; or &lsquo;that which we 
desire to desire&rsquo;; cf. <em>PE</em>, 15-16.) Then either 
&lsquo;the Good&rsquo; means the same as &lsquo;<em>X</em>&rsquo;, or
it does not. If it does, then the definition is trivial, since 
&lsquo;analytic&rsquo;; but if it does not, then the definition is 
incorrect. But for any substitution for 
&lsquo;<em>X</em>&rsquo;&mdash;other than &lsquo;the Good&rsquo; 
itself, which would obviously make (G) analytic&mdash;we can always 
raise the question (i.e., it is always an &lsquo;open 
question&rsquo;) as to whether (G) is true; so 
&lsquo;<em>X</em>&rsquo; cannot mean the same as &lsquo;the 
Good&rsquo; and hence cannot be offered as a definition of 
&lsquo;good&rsquo;. In particular, any attempt at providing a 
<em>naturalistic</em> definition of &lsquo;good&rsquo; is bound to 
fail, the contrary view being dubbed by Moore the &lsquo;naturalistic
fallacy&rsquo;.</p>

<p>

This argument has been influential&mdash;and controversial&mdash;in 
metaethical discussions ever since. But in its general form what we 
have here is the <em>paradox of analysis</em>. (Although the problem 
itself goes back to the paradox of inquiry formulated in 
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Meno</em>, and can be found articulated in 
Frege&rsquo;s writings, too 
 [<a href="s1.html#FregeRH">Quotation</a>],
 the term &lsquo;paradox of analysis&rsquo; was indeed first used in 
relation to Moore&rsquo;s work, by Langford in 1942.) Consider an 
analysis of the form &lsquo;<em>A</em> is <em>C</em>&rsquo;, where 
<em>A</em> is the <em>analysandum</em> (what is analysed) and 
<em>C</em> the <em>analysans</em> (what is offered as the analysis). 
Then either &lsquo;<em>A</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>C</em>&rsquo; 
have the same meaning, in which case the analysis expresses a trivial
identity; or else they do not, in which case the analysis is 
incorrect. So it would seem that no analysis can be both correct and 
informative.</p>

<p>

There is a great deal that might be said about the paradox of 
analysis. At the very least, it seems to cry out for a distinction 
between two kinds of &lsquo;meaning&rsquo;, such as the distinction 
between &lsquo;sense&rsquo; and &lsquo;reference&rsquo; that Frege 
drew, arguably precisely in response to this problem (see Beaney 
2005). An analysis might then be deemed correct if 
&lsquo;<em>A</em>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<em>C</em>&rsquo; have the same 
<em>reference</em>, and informative if &lsquo;<em>C</em>&rsquo; has a
different, or more richly articulated, <em>sense</em> than 
&lsquo;<em>A</em>&rsquo;. In his own response, when the paradox was 
put to him in 1942, Moore talks of the <em>analysandum</em> and the 
<em>analysans</em> being the same <em>concept</em> in a correct 
analysis, but having different <em>expressions</em>. But he admitted 
that he had no clear solution to the problem (<em>RC</em>, 666). And 
if this is so, then it is equally unclear that no definition of 
&lsquo;good&rsquo;&mdash;whether naturalistic or not&mdash;is 
possible.</p>

<p>

However, if Moore provided no general solution to the paradox of 
analysis, his work does offer clarifications of individual concepts, 
and his later writings are characterized by the painstaking attention
to the nuances of language that was to influence Oxford linguistic 
philosophy, in particular.</p>

<h3><a name="5">5. Wittgenstein</a></h3>

<p>

In the preface to his first work, the <em>Tractatus 
Logico-Philosophicus</em>, Wittgenstein records his debt to both 
Frege and Russell. From Frege he inherited the assumptions that the 
logic that Frege had developed was <em>the</em> logic of our language
and that propositions are essentially of function-argument form. 
&ldquo;Like Frege and Russell I construe a proposition as a function 
of the expressions contained in it.&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em>, 3.318; cf. 
5.47.) From Russell he learnt the significance of the theory of 
descriptions. &ldquo;It was Russell who performed the service of 
showing that the apparent logical form of a proposition need not be 
its real one.&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em>, 4.0031.) Unlike Frege and 
Russell, however, he thought that ordinary language was in perfect 
logical order as it was (<em>TLP</em>, 5.5563). The aim was just to 
show how this was so through the construction of an ideal 
<em>notation</em> rather than an ideal <em>language</em>, revealing 
the underlying semantic structure of ordinary propositions no longer 
obscured by their surface syntactic form.</p>

<p>

Arguably unlike Frege, too, Wittgenstein was convinced at the time of
the <em>Tractatus</em> that &ldquo;A proposition has one and only one
complete analysis&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em>, 3.25). The characteristic 
theses of the <em>Tractatus</em> result from thinking through the 
consequences of this, in the context of Fregean logic. Propositions 
are seen as truth-functions of elementary propositions (4.221, 5, 
5.3), and elementary propositions as functions of names (4.22, 4.24).
The meaning of each name is the simple object that it stands for 
(3.203, 3.22), and these simple objects necessarily exist as the 
condition of the meaningfulness of language (2.02ff.). For 
Wittgenstein, the existence of simple objects was guaranteed by the 
requirement that sense be determinate (3.23; cf. <em>NB</em>, 63). It
was in this way that Wittgenstein reached metaphysical conclusions by
rigorously pursuing the implications of his logical views. As he 
noted in his <em>Notebooks</em> in 1916, &ldquo;My work has extended 
from the foundations of logic to the nature of the world&rdquo; 
(<em>NB</em>, 79).</p>

<p>

According to Wittgenstein, then, analysis&mdash;in 
principle&mdash;takes us to the ultimate constituents of 
propositions, and indeed, to the nature of the world itself. That 
Wittgenstein was unable to give any examples of simple objects was 
not seen as an objection to the logical conception itself. Equally 
definite conclusions were drawn as far as our thought was concerned. 
&ldquo;If we know on purely logical grounds that there must be 
elementary propositions, then everyone who understands propositions 
in their unanalysed form must know it.&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em>, 5.5562.)
The claim might seem obviously false, but it was precisely the task 
of analysis to bring out what we only <em>tacitly</em> know.</p>

<p>

This whole logical and metaphysical picture was dismantled in 
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s later work (see especially <em>PI</em>, 
&sect;&sect;1-242). The assumption that Fregean logic provides 
<em>the</em> logic of language and the world was rejected, and the 
many different uses of language were stressed. The idea that names 
<em>mean</em> their bearers, the various theses of functionality and 
compositionality, and the associated appeal to tacit processes of 
generating meaning were criticized. On Wittgenstein&rsquo;s later 
view, &ldquo;nothing is hidden&rdquo; (<em>PI</em>, &sect;435; cf. 
Malcolm 1986, 116); philosophy is simply a matter of getting clear 
about what is already in the public domain&mdash;the grammar of our 
language (<em>PI</em>, &sect;&sect; 122, 126).</p>

<blockquote>Our investigation is therefore a grammatical one. Such an
investigation sheds light on our problem by clearing misunderstandings
away. Misunderstandings concerning the use of words, caused, among
other things, by certain analogies between the forms of expression in
different regions of language.&mdash;Some of them can be removed by
substituting one form of expression for another; this may be called an
&ldquo;analysis&rdquo; of our forms of expression, for the process is
sometimes like one of taking a thing apart. (<em>PI</em>,
&sect;90 [<a href="s1.html#WittgensteinPI90">Full Quotation</a>])</blockquote>

<p>

Wittgenstein&rsquo;s earlier conception of analysis, as combining 
logical analysis with decompositional analysis, has given way to what
has been called &lsquo;connective&rsquo; analysis (Strawson 1992, ch.
2; Hacker 1996, ch. 5). Given how deeply embedded that earlier 
conception was in the whole metaphysics of the <em>Tractatus</em>, 
the critique of the <em>Tractatus</em> has been seen by some to imply
the rejection of analysis altogether and to herald the age of 
&lsquo;post-analytic&rsquo; philosophy. But even Wittgenstein himself
does not repudiate analysis altogether, although (as the passage just
quoted suggests) he does tend to think of &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; 
primarily in its crude decompositional sense. Not only may logical 
analysis, in the sense of &lsquo;translating&rsquo; into a logical 
language, still have value in freeing us from misleading views of 
language, but &lsquo;connective&rsquo; analysis is still worthy of 
being called &lsquo;analysis&rsquo; (as we shall see in the next 
three sections).</p>

<h3><a name="6">6. The Cambridge School of Analysis: Logical and Metaphysical Analysis</a></h3>

<p>

The Cambridge School of Analysis, as it was known at the time, was 
primarily active in the 1930s. Based in Cambridge, it drew its 
inspiration from the logical atomism of Russell and Wittgenstein and 
the earlier work of Moore. As well as Moore himself, its central 
figures included John Wisdom, Susan Stebbing, Max Black and Austin 
Duncan-Jones. Together with C.A. Mace and Gilbert Ryle, Stebbing and 
Duncan-Jones (who was its first editor) founded the journal 
<em>Analysis</em>, which first appeared in November 1933 and which 
remains a key journal of analytic philosophy today.</p>

<p>

The paradigm of analysis at this time was Russell&rsquo;s theory of 
descriptions, which (as we have seen in relation to Russell and 
Wittgenstein above) opened up the whole project of rephrasing 
propositions into their &lsquo;correct&rsquo; logical form, not only 
to avoid the problems generated by misleading surface grammatical 
form, but also to reveal their &lsquo;deep structure&rsquo;. Embedded
in the metaphysics of logical atomism, this gave rise to the idea of 
analysis as the process of uncovering the ultimate constituents of 
our propositions (or the primitive elements of the 
&lsquo;facts&rsquo; that our propositions represent).</p>

<p>

This characterization suggests a distinction that has already been 
implicitly drawn, and which was first explicitly drawn in the 1930s 
by Susan Stebbing (1932, 1933b, 1934) and John Wisdom (1934), in 
particular, between what was called &lsquo;logical&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;same-level&rsquo; analysis and &lsquo;philosophical&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;metaphysical&rsquo; or &lsquo;reductive&rsquo; or 
&lsquo;directional&rsquo; or &lsquo;new-level&rsquo; analysis. The 
first translates the proposition to be analyzed into better logical 
form, whilst the second aims to exhibit its metaphysical 
presuppositions. In Russell&rsquo;s case, having &lsquo;analyzed 
away&rsquo; the definite description, what is then shown is just what
commitments remain&mdash;to logical constants and concepts, which may
in turn require further analysis to &lsquo;reduce&rsquo; them to 
things of our supposed immediate acquaintance.</p>

<p>

The value of drawing this distinction is that it allows us to accept 
the first type of analysis but reject the second, which is just what 
Max Black (1933) did in responding to Stebbing (1933b). Attacking the
idea of metaphysical analysis as uncovering facts, he considers the 
following example:</p>

<blockquote>(E) Every economist is fallible.</blockquote>

<p>

Black suggests that a metaphysical analysis, on Stebbing's 
conception, at least at an intermediate level, would yield the 
following set of facts:</p>

<blockquote>(E#) Maynard Keynes is fallible, Josiah Stamp is fallible,
etc.</blockquote>

<p>

Yet (E) does not mean the same as (E#), Black objects, unless 
&lsquo;means&rsquo; is being used loosely in the sense of 
&lsquo;entails&rsquo;. But analysis cannot exhibit the propositions 
entailed, since this would require knowing, in this example, the name
of every economist. The correct analysis, Black suggests, is simply:</p>

<blockquote>(E*) (<em>x</em>) (<em>x</em> is an economist) entails
(<em>x</em> is fallible).</blockquote>

<p>

This is a logical analysis of structure rather than a metaphysical 
uncovering of facts. (1933, 257.)</p>

<p>

Similar arguments might be offered in the case of other general 
propositions, which together with negative propositions proved 
particularly resistant to &lsquo;reductive&rsquo; analysis, and the 
rejection of the latter in favour of logical analysis, and later, 
linguistic analysis, came to characterize the next phase of analytic 
philosophy.</p>

<h3><a name="7">7. Carnap and Logical Positivism: Quasi-analysis and Explication</a></h3>

<p>

The rejection of metaphysical analysis is characteristic of logical 
positivism, which developed in Vienna during the 1920s and 1930s. The
central figure was Rudolf Carnap, who was influenced not only by 
Frege, Russell and Wittgenstein but also by neo-Kantianism (see 
Friedman 2000, Richardson 1998). His work can be seen as marking the 
transition to logical and linguistic forms of analysis unencumbered, 
at least officially, by metaphysical baggage.</p>

<p>

Carnap&rsquo;s key methodological conception in his first major work,
<em>Der logische Aufbau der Welt</em> (1928) is that of 
<em>quasi-analysis</em>. Carnap held that the fundamental 
&lsquo;units&rsquo; of experience were not the qualities (the 
colours, shapes, etc.) involved in individual experiences, but those 
experiences themselves, taken as indivisible wholes. But this meant 
that analysis&mdash;<em>understood in the decompositional 
sense</em>&mdash;could not yield these qualities, precisely because 
they were not seen as <em>constituents</em> of the elementary 
experiences (1928, &sect;68). Instead, they were to be 
&lsquo;constructed&rsquo; by <em>quasi-analysis</em>, a method that 
mimics analysis in yielding &lsquo;quasi-constituents&rsquo;, but 
which proceeds &lsquo;synthetically&rsquo; rather than 
&lsquo;analytically&rsquo; (1928, &sect;&sect; 69, 74).</p>

<p>

In essence, Carnap&rsquo;s method of quasi-analysis is just that 
method of logical abstraction that Frege had used in &sect;62 of the 
<em>Grundlagen</em> (albeit without seeing it as 
&lsquo;abstraction&rsquo;). An equivalence relation holding between 
things of one kind (concepts in Frege&rsquo;s case) is used to define
or &lsquo;construct&rsquo; things of another kind (numbers in 
Frege&rsquo;s case). Just as numbers are not <em>constituents</em> of
the concepts to which they are ascribed, but can be constructed from 
appropriate equivalence relations, so too can other 
&lsquo;quasi-constituents&rsquo; be constructed. (For detailed 
discussion of quasi-analysis, and the complications and difficulties 
that it gives rise to, see Goodman 1977, ch. 5; Richardson 1998, ch. 
2.)</p>

<p>

Carnap&rsquo;s use of the term &lsquo;quasi-analysis&rsquo; is 
revealing, for the &lsquo;quasi&rsquo; suggests that he is still in 
thrall to the decompositional conception of analysis, despite his 
recognition that there are other forms of analysis, e.g., which use 
abstraction instead. By the early 1930s, however, Carnap is happy to 
use the term &lsquo;analysis&rsquo;&mdash;or more specifically, 
&lsquo;logical analysis&rsquo;&mdash;for methods of abstraction and 
construction. In a paper called &lsquo;The Method of Logical 
Analysis&rsquo;, given at a conference in 1934, for example, he 
wrote: &ldquo;The logical analysis of a particular expression 
consists in the setting-up of a linguistic system and the placing of 
that expression in this system.&rdquo; (1936, 143.) By this time, 
Carnap&rsquo;s &lsquo;linguistic turn&rsquo; had occurred (see Carnap
1932, 1934); but the conception underlying the <em>Aufbau</em> 
remained: analysis involves exhibiting the structural relations of 
something by locating it in an abstract theoretical system.</p>

<p>

In his later work Carnap talks of analysis as 
&lsquo;explication&rsquo;, though this also goes back to the 
<em>Aufbau</em>, where Carnap talked of &lsquo;rational 
reconstruction&rsquo;. (The connection between the two ideas is made 
clear in Carnap&rsquo;s preface to the 2nd edition of the 
<em>Aufbau</em>). In <em>Meaning and Necessity</em> (1947), Carnap 
characterizes explication as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The task of making more exact a vague or not quite exact
concept used in everyday life or in an earlier stage of scientific or
logical development, or rather of replacing it by a newly constructed,
more exact concept, belongs among the most important tasks of logical
analysis and logical construction. We call this the task of
explicating, or of giving an <em>explication</em> for, the earlier
concept &hellip; (1947, 7-8)</blockquote>

<p>

Carnap gives as examples Frege&rsquo;s and Russell&rsquo;s logicist 
explication of number terms such as 
&lsquo;two&rsquo;&mdash;&ldquo;the term &lsquo;two&rsquo; in the not 
quite exact meaning in which it is used in everyday life and in 
applied mathematics&rdquo;&mdash;and their different explications of 
definite descriptions (1947, 8).</p>

<p>

A fuller discussion of explication is provided in the first chapter 
of <em>Logical Foundations of Probability</em> (1950 
 [<a href="s1.html#Carnap1950">Quotation</a>]),
 where Carnap offers criteria of adequacy for explication, and gives 
as his main example the concept of temperature as explicating the 
vaguer concept of warmth. The idea of a scientifically defined 
concept <em>replacing</em> an everyday concept may be problematic, 
but the idea that analysis involves &lsquo;translating&rsquo; 
something into a richer theoretical system is not only characteristic
of a central strand in analytic philosophy but has also been fruitful
throughout the history of philosophy. In effect, it originates in 
ancient Greek geometry, though it can be seen more prominently in 
analytic geometry (see the supplementary section on 
 <a href="s4.html#2">Descartes and Analytic Geometry</a>).
 It is not therefore new, but it was certainly foregrounded in 
philosophy and given a modern lease of life in the context of the new
logical systems developed by Frege, Russell and Carnap.</p>

<h3><a name="8">8. Oxford Linguistic Philosophy: Linguistic and Connective Analysis</a></h3>

<p>

Michael Dummett (1991a, 111) has suggested that the precise moment at
which the &lsquo;linguistic turn&rsquo; in philosophy was taken is 
&sect;62 of Frege&rsquo;s <em>Grundlagen</em>, where in answer to the
question as to how numbers are given to us, Frege proposes to define 
the sense of a proposition in which a number term occurs. Dummett has
also stated that &lsquo;the fundamental axiom of analytical 
philosophy&rsquo; is that &ldquo;the only route to the analysis of 
thought goes through the analysis of language&rdquo; (1993, 128). Yet
both Frege and Russell were hostile to ordinary language, and the 
&lsquo;linguistic turn&rsquo; was only properly taken in 
Wittgenstein's <em>Tractatus</em>, before being consolidated in the 
work of Carnap in the early 1930s. But Dummett&rsquo;s axiom has been
held by many analytic philosophers and it was certainly 
characteristic of Oxford philosophy in the two decades or so after 
the Second World War.</p>

<p>

Gilbert Ryle can be taken as representative here. In one of his 
earliest works, dating from before the war, he had argued that 
language is &lsquo;systematically misleading&rsquo; (1932), although 
as he himself later remarked (in Rorty 1967, 305 
 [<a href="s1.html#Ryle1967">Quotation</a>]),
 he was still under the influence of the idea that was always a 
&lsquo;correct&rsquo; logical form to be uncovered (see 
 <a href="index-2.html#6">&sect;6</a>
 of the main document). But with the breakdown of logical atomism (see

 <a href="#6">&sect;6</a>
 above), the emphasis shifted to the careful description of what Ryle 
called the &lsquo;logical geography&rsquo; of our concepts. 
Ryle&rsquo;s most important work was <em>The Concept of Mind</em>, 
published in 1949, in which he argued that the Cartesian dogma of the
&lsquo;Ghost in the Machine&rsquo; was the result of a 
&lsquo;category-mistake&rsquo;, confusing mental descriptions with 
the language of physical events. Again, Ryle was later critical of 
the implication that the single notion of a category-mistake could 
function as a &lsquo;skeleton-key&rsquo; for all problems (1954, 9); 
but the detailed accounts of individual concepts that he provided in 
his work as a whole demonstrated the power and value of linguistic 
analysis, and offered a model for other philosophers. In chapter 2, 
for example, he draws an important distinction between <em>knowing 
how</em> and <em>knowing that</em>. There are many things that I 
<em>know how</em> to do&mdash;such as ride a bicycle&mdash;without 
being able to explain what I am doing, i.e., without <em>knowing 
that</em> I am following such-and-such a rule. The temptation to 
assimilate <em>knowing how</em> to <em>knowing that</em> must thus be
resisted.</p>

<p>

J. L. Austin was another influential figure in Oxford at the time. 
Like Ryle, he emphasized the need to pay careful attention to our 
ordinary use of language, although he has been criticized for valuing
subtle linguistic distinctions for their own sake. He was influential
in the creation of speech-act theory, with such distinctions as that 
between locutionary, illocutionary and perlocutionary acts (Austin 
1962a). Although Austin shared Ryle&rsquo;s belief that reflection on
language could resolve traditional philosophical problems, linguistic
analysis has since come to be employed more and more as a tool in the
construction of theories of language. But one good illustration of 
the importance of such reflection for philosophy occurs in section IV
of Austin&rsquo;s book <em>Sense and Sensibilia</em> (1962b), where 
Austin considers the various uses of the verbs &lsquo;appear&rsquo;, 
&lsquo;look&rsquo; and &lsquo;seem&rsquo;. Compare, for example, the 
following (1962b, 36):</p>

<blockquote>(1) He looks guilty. 

<p>

(2) He appears guilty.</p>

<p>

(3) He seems guilty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

There are clearly differences here, and thinking through such 
differences enables one to appreciate just how crude some of the 
arguments are for theories of perception that appeal to 
&lsquo;sense-data&rsquo;.</p>

<p>

Ryle, in particular, dominated the philosophical scene at Oxford (and
perhaps in Britain more generally) in the 1950s and 1960s. He was 
Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy from 1945 to 1968 and 
Editor of <em>Mind</em> from 1947 to 1971. His successor in the chair
was P.F. Strawson, whose critique of Russell&rsquo;s theory of 
descriptions in his own seminal paper of 1950, &lsquo;On 
Referring&rsquo;, and his <em>Introduction to Logical Theory</em> of 
1952 had also helped establish ordinary language philosophy as a 
counterweight to the tradition of Frege, Russell and Carnap. The 
appearance of <em>Individuals</em> in 1959 and <em>The Bounds of 
Sense</em> in 1966 signalled a return to metaphysics, but it was a 
metaphysics that Strawson called &lsquo;descriptive&rsquo; (as 
opposed to &lsquo;revisionary&rsquo;) metaphysics, aimed at 
clarifying our fundamental conceptual frameworks. It is here that we 
can see how &lsquo;connective&rsquo; analysis has replaced 
&lsquo;reductive&rsquo; analysis; and this shift was explicitly 
discussed in the work Strawson published shortly after he retired, 
<em>Analysis and Metaphysics</em> (1992). Strawson notes that 
analysis has often been thought of as &ldquo;a kind of breaking down 
or decomposing of something&rdquo; (1992, 2), but points out that it 
also has a more comprehensive sense (1992, 19), which he draws on in 
offering a &lsquo;connective model&rsquo; of analysis to contrast 
with the &lsquo;reductive or atomistic model&rsquo; (1992, 21). Our 
most basic concepts, on this view, are &lsquo;irreducible&rsquo;, but
not &lsquo;simple&rsquo;:</p>

<blockquote>A concept may be complex, in the sense that its
philosophical elucidation requires the establishing of its connections
with other concepts, and yet at the same time irreducible, in the sense
that it cannot be defined away, without circularity, in terms of those
other concepts to which it is necessarily related. (1992,
22-3)</blockquote>

<p>

Such a view is not new. The point had also been made by A.C. Ewing, 
for example, in a book on ethics published in 1953. Responding 
directly to Moore&rsquo;s arguments in <em>Principia Ethica</em> (see

 <a href="#4">&sect;4</a>
 above), Ewing remarks that &ldquo;To maintain that good is 
indefinable is not to maintain that we cannot know what it is like or
that we cannot say anything about it but only that it is not 
reducible to anything else&rdquo; (1953, 89). Whatever one&rsquo;s 
view of reductionist programmes, an essential part of philosophy has 
always been the clarification of our fundamental concepts. Reflected 
in the idea of connective analysis, it is perhaps this, above all, 
that has allowed talk of &lsquo;analytic&rsquo; philosophy to 
continue despite the demise of logical atomism and logical 
positivism.</p>

<h3><a name="9">9. Contemporary Analytic Philosophy: The Varieties of Analysis</a></h3>

<p>

As mentioned at the beginning of this entry, analytic philosophy 
should really be seen as a set of interlocking subtraditions held 
together by a shared repertoire of conceptions of analysis upon which
individual philosophers draw in different ways. There are conflicts 
between these various subtraditions. In his inaugural lecture of 
1969, &lsquo;Meaning and Truth&rsquo;, Strawson spoke of a 
&lsquo;Homeric struggle&rsquo; between theorists of formal semantics,
as represented in their different ways by Frege, the early 
Wittgenstein and Chomsky, and theorists of communication-intention, 
as represented by Austin, Paul Grice and the later Wittgenstein 
(1969, 171-2). The ideas of the former were to be developed, most 
notably, by Donald Davidson and Michael Dummett, and the ideas of the
latter by Strawson himself and John Searle; and the debate has 
continued to this day, ramifying into many areas of philosophy. Nor 
is there agreement on what Dummett called the &lsquo;fundamental 
axiom&rsquo; of analytic philosophy, that the analysis of language is
prior to the analysis of thought (1993, 128). As Dummett himself 
noted (ibid., 4), Gareth Evans&rsquo;s work, <em>The Varieties of 
Reference</em> (1982), would seem to put him outside the analytic 
tradition, so characterized. To suggest that he only remains inside 
in virtue of &ldquo;adopting a certain philosophical style and 
&hellip; appealing to certain writers rather than to certain 
others&rdquo; (Dummett 1993, 5) is already to admit the inadequacy of
the characterization.</p>

<p>

Since the 1960s, the centre of gravity of analytic philosophy has 
shifted towards North America, counterbalanced slightly by the 
blossoming in recent years of analytic philosophy in continental 
Europe and South America and its continued growth in Australasia. 
Although many of the logical positivists&mdash;most notably, 
Carnap&mdash;emigrated to the United States in the 1930s, it took a 
while for their ideas to take root and develop. Quine is the towering
figure here, and his famous critique of Carnap&rsquo;s 
analytic/synthetic distinction (Quine 1951) was instrumental in 
inaugurating a view of philosophy as continuous with the natural 
sciences, with the corresponding rejection of the view that there was
anything distinctive about conceptual analysis. His critique was 
questioned at the time by Grice and Strawson (1956), but it is only 
in the last few years that the issue has been revisited with a more 
charitable view of Carnap (Ebbs 1997, Part II; Friedman 1999, ch. 9; 
Richardson 1998, ch. 9).</p>

<p>

One recent defence of conceptual analysis, with a qualified rejection
of Quine&rsquo;s critique of analyticity, has been offered by Frank 
Jackson in his book, <em>From Metaphysics to Ethics</em> (1998). On 
Jackson&rsquo;s view, the role of conceptual analysis is to make 
explicit our &lsquo;folk theory&rsquo; about a given matter, 
elucidating our concepts by considering how individuals classify 
possibilities (1998, 31-3). To the extent that it involves 
&lsquo;making best sense&rsquo; of our responses (<em>ibid</em>., 
36), it is closer to what Quine called &lsquo;paraphrasing&rsquo; 
(1960, &sect;&sect; 33, 53) than the simple recording of our ordinary
intuitions (Jackson 1998, 45). Jackson argues for a 
&lsquo;modest&rsquo; role for conceptual analysis, but in so far as 
he admits that a certain &ldquo;massaging of folk intuitions&rdquo; 
may be required (<em>ibid</em>., 47), it is not clear that his 
conception is as neutral as he suggests. Consider, for example, his 
central argument in chapter 4, offered in defence of the view that 
colours are primary qualities of objects (<em>ibid</em>., 93):</p>

<blockquote>(Pr. 1) Yellowness is the property of objects putatively
presented to subjects when those objects look yellow. 

<p>

(Pr. 2) The property of objects putatively presented to subjects when
the objects look yellow is at least a normal cause of their looking 
yellow.</p>

<p>

(Pr. 3) The only causes (normal or otherwise) of objects' looking 
yellow are complexes of physical qualities.</p>

<p>

(Conc.) Yellowness is a complex of the physical qualities of objects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>

(Pr. 1) exemplifies what Jackson calls our &ldquo;prime intuition 
about colour&rdquo;, (Pr. 2) is a &ldquo;conceptual truth about 
presentation&rdquo;, and (Pr. 3) is the empirical truth that is 
required to reach the metaphysical conclusion (Conc.) that 
&lsquo;locates&rsquo; yellowness in our ontology. (Pr. 1) is intended
to encapsulate our ordinary &lsquo;folk view&rsquo;. But as it stands
it is ambiguous. Does (Pr. 1) say that there <em>is</em> a property, 
but one about which we are unsure whether it is really presented to 
us or not, or that the property itself is only putative? The latter 
reading is closest to the &lsquo;triviality&rsquo; Jackson says he 
wants as his &ldquo;secure starting-place&rdquo;, which might be 
better expressed as &ldquo;yellowness is the property objects look to
have when they look yellow&rdquo; (cf. 1998, 89); but it is the 
former that is doing the work in the argument. If the property itself
is only putative (i.e., if colours are not properties of objects at 
all, as some people have held), then (Pr. 2) is false; at the very 
least, it is not a conceptual truth that putative properties can be 
normal causes. This is not to say that Jackson is wrong about the 
primary quality view of colour. But it does illustrate just what 
assumptions may already be involved in articulating &lsquo;folk 
intuitions&rsquo;, even on a supposedly &lsquo;modest&rsquo; 
understanding of conceptual analysis. In the end, as the history of 
conceptions of analysis shows, no conception can be dissociated from 
the logical and metaphysical context in which it operates.</p>

<p>

Analytic philosophy, then, is a broad and still ramifying movement in
which various conceptions of analysis compete and pull in different 
directions. Reductive and connective, revisionary and descriptive, 
linguistic and psychological, formal and empirical elements all 
coexist in creative tension; and it is this creative tension that is 
the great strength of the analytic tradition.</p>

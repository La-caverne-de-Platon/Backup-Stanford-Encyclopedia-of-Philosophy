So far as E.R.
Clay is concerned, Andersen and Grush (2009, &sect;7) rightly
observe that commentators invariably recycle the quote from
Clay&rsquo;s <em>The Alternative</em> supplied by James (as, indeed,
has just been done here). They have performed the valuable
service of tracking down both Clay and <em>The Alternative.</em>
It turns out that &lsquo;E.R. Clay&rsquo; is a pseudonym of Robert
Kelly, an Irish immigrant to the U.S. who built up a successful cigar
company, and took up an interest in philosophy after taking an early
retirement. In the same article Andersen and Grush provide a very
useful survey of other (non-Germanic) influences on James, e.g., Reid,
Dugald Steward, Thomas Brown, William Hamilton and Shadworth
Hodgson.</p>

Gallagher (1998:
205) relates that in his well-annotated copy of James&rsquo;
<em>Principles</em> Husserl jotted down a German translation of the
term, but his handwriting is indecipherable at this point.</p>

Heidegger took
these ingredients from Husserl&rsquo;s approach and fashioned something
quite different from them. The Heideggerian conception of
&lsquo;originary time&rsquo; is intriguing, but also difficult; here is
one attempt to summarize it: &lsquo;Originary temporality is a manifold
of nonsuccessive phenomena that explain ordinary time. The
elements of the manifold go by the names &ldquo;future&rdquo;
(<em>Zukunft</em>), &ldquo;beenness&rdquo; (<em>Gewsenheit</em>), and
&ldquo;Present&rdquo; (<em>Gegenwart</em>). They are
non-successive in the precise sense that the future does not follow,
succeed, or come after beenness.&rsquo; (Blattner 1999:
26&ndash;7). Also see Barrett (1968) and Guignon (1983).</p>

(2009: 5.6) for a more detailed exposition of his views on continuity;

Bergson&rsquo;s
complained that conceiving of the continuity of experience in
mathematical terms reduces experience to a &lsquo;dust of
instants&rsquo;(&lsquo;<em>poussi&egrave;re des
instants</em>&rsquo;). Poincar&eacute; is in sympathy with this,
and points out that the orthodox mathematical continuum &lsquo;is only
a collection of individuals ranged in a certain order, infinite in
number, true, but <em>exterior</em> to one another. This is not
the ordinary conception, wherein is supposed between the elements of
the continuum a sort of intimate bond which makes of them a whole where
the point does not exist before the line, but the line before the
point. Of the celebrated formula, &lsquo;the continuum is unity
in multiplicity&rsquo;, only the multiplicity remains, the unity has
disappeared.&rsquo; (1902/1952: 42). For more on this theme see Capek
(1971), Part II.</p>

There
<em>is</em> evidence of motion aftereffects occurring in the tactile
(see Hayashi et al, 2006) and auditory domains (see Dong, C-J. et al,
2000), but it is not clear that analogues of the paradoxical features of
the visual case are present in these cases.</p>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
&lsquo;If we
have a single experience of two items as being present, then, surely,
we experience them as simultaneous. Suppose we are aware of A as
preceding B, and of B as present. Can we be aware of A as
anything other than past? Of course we can have successive
experience of items, each of which in turn we see as present. But
no single experience presents all these items as present.&rsquo; (2007:
87) ; also see (2004: 111).</p>
</div>
<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
Can we pick
out a briefer span &ndash; or even an instant &ndash; within the
duration of the specious present as <em>the</em> present? There
is nothing to prevent our doing so, but given its the brief span,
dividing the specious present in this way would serve little practical
purpose. Clay seemingly took the leading edge to be present in
the strict sense; James was evidently situating his vantage point in
the middle region when he referred to &lsquo;backward&rsquo; and
&lsquo;forward looking parts.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
There are
further options: see Tye (2003: chapter 4) for an attempt to combine
something akin to an Extensional view with
&lsquo;representationalist&rsquo; account of perceptual experience;
note, however, that Tye&rsquo;s account of the specious present is in
some respects idiosyncratic.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
Sprigge
(1983: ch.1) defends a view along these lines; Whitehead believed that
reality was composed of &lsquo;drops of experience&rsquo; (1929: 25);
see Sprigge (1993: 276ff) for an introduction to Bradley&rsquo;s
&lsquo;finite centres of experience&rsquo; &ndash; which Bradley
himself regarded as inherently problematic.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-14">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
For further
discussion of these see Mabbot (1951, 1955), Mundle (1954), Foster
(1979) and Dainton (2000: &sect;6.2).  In an interesting recent survey of criticisms of Broad&rsquo;s views, Rashbrook (2012) argues that they are in fact less problematic, on several fronts, than critics allege.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-15">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
Tye argues
that there is no problem here, on the grounds that it is a mistake to
conclude that a sound is <em>heard as</em> occurring several times
simply because there are several times at which it is heard (2003:
93&ndash;94). But while it is logically possible for there be
experiences which go unnoticed by their subject, it remains the case
that Broad&rsquo;s theory is profligate to an extraordinary degree,
requiring as it does a vast censorship mechanism to conceal the
innumerable surplus-to-requirements experiences it generates. And
as Phillips (2010: &sect;4.1) notes, Tye&rsquo;s proposal is
incompatible with plausible doctrines concerning the sort of epistemic
access we have to our own experience.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
&lsquo;If
<em>A, B</em>, and <em>C</em> succeed each other rapidly, <em>A</em>
and <em>B</em> may be parts of one sensation, and likewise <em>B</em>
and <em>C</em>, while <em>A</em> and <em>C</em> are not parts of one
sensation, but <em>A</em> is remembered when <em>C</em> is present in
sensation. In such a case, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> belong to
the same present, and likewise <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>, but not
<em>A</em> and <em>C</em>; thus the relation &ldquo;belong to the same
present&rdquo; is not transitive &hellip; two presents may overlap
without coinciding.&rsquo; (1913: 77&ndash;78)</p>
</div>
<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
It is
possible (in principle) for specious presents to be separated by very
little indeed: &lsquo;it may be that the whole series of experiences is
literally continuous (or at least dense)&rsquo;, or so Foster suggests
(1991: 248).</p>
</div>
<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
Strawson has
recently elaborated a Retentional model which eschews strictly
momentary episodes of experiencing: &lsquo;What is the duration of the
living moment of experience? I take it to be very short indeed.
&hellip; One thing I take for granted is that experience takes time: it
can&rsquo;t exist or occur at an instant, where an instant is defined
as something with no temporal duration at all. So I take
&lsquo;moment&rsquo; as it features in the expression &lsquo;living
moment of experience&rsquo; to refer essentially to a temporal
<em>interval</em>, however short.&rsquo; (Strawson 2009:
256).</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
This diagram
resembles the one provided by Broad himself (1938: 285), but he adopted
a different (and perhaps less perspicuous) convention for representing
specious presents. Broad chooses to represent individual specious
by <em>triangles</em>, such as A-D-A***. He took the height of
the vertical lines to represent degrees of presentedness, so C has
presentedness C-A** in the specious present A-D-A***, and presentedness
C-B* in the specious present B-E-B** &ndash; the higher the vertical,
the greater the presentedness.</p>

Section 36
of the 1905 Lectures is headed <em>The Time-Constituting Flow as
Absolute Subjectivity</em> and concludes thus: &lsquo;This flow is
something we can speak of <em>in conformity with what is
constituted</em>, but it is not &ldquo;something in objective
time&rdquo;. It is <em>absolute subjectivity</em> and has the
absolute properties of something to be designated
<em>metaphorically</em> as &ldquo;flow&rdquo;; of something that
originates in a point of actuality, in a primal source-point,
&ldquo;the now&rdquo;, and so on. In the actuality-experience we
have the primal source-point and a continuity of moments of
reverberation. For all this we lack names.&rsquo; (1991: 79)</p>
</div>
<div id="note-22">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
Tye&rsquo;s
definition of phenomenal unity as &lsquo;a relation that connects
qualities instantiated in adjacent specious presents&rsquo; (2003: 101)
is puzzling, since it seems to leave the qualities <em>within</em>
specious presents in the awkward position of <em>not</em> being
directly phenomenally unified, even though the specious present is
where we experience succession and persistence, as Tye himself seems to
accept (2003: 86&ndash;7). See Bayne (2005) and Kobes (2005) for
further discussion of Tye&rsquo;s position.</p>

See Roache
(1999) for an argument to the effect that the apparently very different
standpoints of Dennett and Mellor are in fact reconcilable.</p>

<div id="note-24">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
Prominent
defenders of this conception are not hard to find, e.g. Minkowski
(1908), Williams (1951), Smart (1980), Mellor (1981, 1998)</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
Broad
introduced the &lsquo;spotlight&rsquo; metaphor (1923: 59), though at
the time he subscribed to the Growing Block view; the Moving Spotlight
conception is perhaps best known for being the primary target of
McTaggart&rsquo;s assault on the reality of time. For a more
recent defence of the Growing Block see Tooley (1997); for a defence of
Presentism see Bourne (2006); for more on the Moving Spotlight see Skow (2015).</p>
</div>
<div id="note-26">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
The issue is
not quite so straightforward. McKinnon (2003) argues that
Presentism poses problems for Retentionalists too, on the grounds that
there is good reason to believe the neural correlates of consciousness
are extended over time, and that attempts by Presentists to accommodate
this fact (e.g., by appealing to tensed properties possessed by
momentary brain-phases) are unsatisfactory.</p>
</div>
<div id="note-27">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>
Peter
Forrest advocates a form of the Growing Block model in which
consciousness only exists in the present; consciousness, he believes,
is a by-product of the &lsquo;frisson&rsquo; generated at the interface
between being and non-being. (Braddon-Mitchell 2002; Forrest 2004,
2006). Since it is not clear whether on this model
consciousness is momentary or not, it is difficult to know what its
implications for the current issue are. It is also worth adding
that this model is rather speculative.</p>

For further
discussion of Dennett see the commentaries in <em>Brain and Behavioural
Sciences</em> following Dennett and Kinsbourne (1992); the special
issue of <em>Inquiry</em> (March 1993, 36(1&ndash;2), with essays by Clark,
Fellows &amp; O&rsquo;Hear, Foster, Lockwood, Seager, Siewert,
Sprigge); <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em> 1993,
53(4), with essays by Tye, Shoemaker, Jackson; also Phillips (2009:
chapter 5).</p>

 <a href="specious-present.html#ref-29">29.</a>
Drawing
these distinctions gives rise to a range of underexplored and difficult
to answer, questions. For example, can the apparent variations in
the &lsquo;speed&rsquo; of the objective world be explained in
variations in the extent of the specious present? Noting the work
of Saillant and Simons (1998) which suggests bats possess the ability
to alter the temporal span of their echolocation systems&rsquo;
&lsquo;sensory window&rsquo;, Lockwood has proposed that the apparent
slowing of the surrounding world (in times of emergency or absorption)
is due to a &lsquo;diminution in the temporal span of the specious
present&rsquo; (2005: 373); this shrinkage results in our apprehending
a smaller than usual number of changes within a typical specious
present; since we are not directly aware of latter&rsquo;s change in
size, we attribute the alteration to a slow-down in our
surroundings. Implicit in the story Lockwood tells is the
assumption that the <em>phenomenal</em> duration of the specious
present remains constant &ndash; and Strawson (2009: 253) agrees:
&lsquo;One may expressly intellectually register the fact that one is
experiencing a great deal in a short time (a short time that feels for
all that particularly calm and leisurely), in moments of great crisis,
but this does not mean that the basic, subjective experienced temporal
extent or &ldquo;roominess&rdquo; of the lived present experience is
not the same as it is in ordinary life&rsquo;. These are
intriguing proposals, but are they correct?</p>

For a survey
of relevant work on the neural bases of temporal processing, see Mauk
&amp; Buonomano (2004). Kelly argues that the vast bulk of
empirical work is focused on just two questions: How do we come to
represent events as occurring at a particular time? Which events
to we experience as simultaneous? He draws this conclusion:
&lsquo;The puzzle of temporal experience will not be resolved by
empirical research <em>of the type now being done</em> &hellip; [the
relevant neuroscientific accounts] do not have any bearing at all, in
other words, on the question of how we are to conceptualize perceptual
experience from the point of view of the subject so as to allow for the
possibility of experiences as of continuous, dynamic, temporally
structured, unified events.&rsquo; (2005b, &sect;7&ndash;7.1) Kelly also
believes that an alternative to the standard Retentional and
Extensional approaches will be needed.</p>

As Debru
(2001: 478) notes, it may be that James&rsquo; figure of 12 seconds was
also influenced by Helmholtz&rsquo;s discovery that
<em>after-images</em> typically have a maximal duration of 12 seconds
or so.</p>

And when
describing Wundt&rsquo;s attempt to measure the interval which is
remembered most accurately: &lsquo;[this interval] of about
three-fourths of a second, which is estimated with the minimum of
error, points to a connection between the time-feeling and the
succession of distinctly apperceived objects before the mind. The
association time is also equal to about three-fourths of a second. This
association time he regards as a sort of internal standard of duration
to which we involuntarily assimilate all intervals which we try to
reproduce, bringing shorter ones up to it and longer ones
down.&rsquo; (1890: 596&ndash;7)</p>

Myers (1971:
355) notes that Boring claimed James&rsquo; commitment to this approach
stemmed from a general doctrine concerning the temporal character of
introspection: &lsquo;introspection was not believed to be a process
that takes time &hellip; But how then can a duration that takes time be
immediately known, since the duration, not being instantaneous, is
itself not all immediate?&rsquo; (1942: 576). Myers has his
doubts: &lsquo;I cannot connect Boring&rsquo;s remarks with what James
wrote in &ldquo;The Perception of Time&rdquo; in <em>The Principles of
Psychology</em>, because he never said that introspection is
instantaneous or that the duration of the specious present is
specious&rsquo; (<em>ibid.</em>). Mabbot (1951: 165) usefully
summarizes Boring&rsquo;s changes of view on these matters.</p>

If he
<em>were</em> committed to full-blooded duration-blocks <em>and</em>
the Retentional approach, the upshot is the Non-Modal form of
Retentionalism, which as we have seen, arguably generates too much
experience. See Sprigge (1993: 198&ndash;225) for an interesting
discussion of how James&rsquo; views on time, experience and continuity
evolved through his career.</p>

There is
another strand to Varela&rsquo;s argument: he suggests that neural cell
assemblies will flip between their favoured states given the slightest
of pushes, and that this &lsquo;self-powered&rsquo; behaviour may be
the physical correlate of experienced alterations in phenomenal
contents, e.g., the perceived changes in aspect of a Necker cube.
However, the idea that experience is naturally packaged into discrete
chunks is not in the least Husserlian, and so this proposal is
peripheral to our current concerns.</p>

Grush notes
that his interpretation of such cases is similar in some respects to
the multiple drafts model of Dennett (1991: ch. 5&ndash;6), but the
trajectory estimation model is not committed to a plurality of
competing <em>simultaneous</em> representations. In some respects
it is also similar to the &lsquo;fixed-lag smoother&rsquo; model that
Rao, Eagleman and Sejnewski (2001) employ to explain related temporal
illusions (e.g. the <em>flash-lag</em>), but has the advantage of not
postulating a delay of around 100&ndash;200 msec between sensory stimuli and
their subsequent representations (Grush 2005b:
214&ndash;216).</p>

Of the two
most general visual pathways in primates &lsquo;we find that it is the
older tectopulvinar pathway (evolutionarily speaking) that is more
involved in motion perception than the newer geniculostriate
pathway. There are some suggestions that the tectopulvinar
pathway may be entirely specialized for the perception of movement,
along with the control of responses that involve moving stimuli, such
as some kinds of eye movements&rsquo; (Coren, Ward, Enns: 360).</p>

There are
complications. Although 20&ndash;30 fps is sufficient to generate
smooth apparent motion, higher rates are needed to eliminate variations
in brightness (flicker); accordingly, in cinema and TV the same image
is shown two or three times in succession. Three factors are most
relevant to the quality of apparent motion: interstimulus interval (the
time between the end of one frame and the start of the next), frame
duration, and the time between the start of one frame and the start of
the next &ndash; the latter is the most important single factor. For
further detail on a complex topic, &lsquo;flicker studies&rsquo;, see
Anderson &amp; Anderson (1993), Galifret (2006).</p>

Intriguingly, Allport also distinguishes two forms of the perceptual
moment theory: the &lsquo;Discrete Moment Hypothesis&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Travelling Moment Hypothesis&rsquo;. According to the
former, perceptual moments are entirely discrete, whereas according to
the latter, they overlap (e.g., if one moment takes in A-B-C-D, the
next will take in B-C-D-E, etc. ). The details are not clear, but
there are certainly some similarities between Travelling Moment
Hypothesis and the overlap version of Extensionalism. Allport
illustrates the travelling model thus: &lsquo;A simple spatial analogy
may help to make this distinction clear. To a man standing on the
platform, the occupants of a passing train are revealed compartment by
compartment as each window draws by. His glimpses of the interior
of the train are essentially discontinuous in time. To an
observer in one of the compartments, on the other hand, the field of
view is always bounded by his own carriage window. New elements
of the passing scene enter his view continuously from one side of the
window, while others drop out of it at the other. Given a
temporal rather than a spatial extension, the moving window analogy
corresponds with the idea of a continuous &ldquo;travelling
moment&rdquo; &rsquo;(1968: 396). Efron and Lee (1973) argue that
the experimental evidence which leads Allport to prefer the Travelling
Moment Hypothesis over its Discrete counterpart can also be explained
in terms of visible persistence.</p>

<h2>The Commentaries of Simplicius</h2>

<p>
It is curious that Simplicius wrote several commentaries on Aristotle
and one on Epictetus, but none, it seems, on Plato (with the possible
exception of a commentary on the <em>Phaedo</em>; see Goulet &amp;
Coda 2016: 361&ndash;364 and 390&ndash;394). How can this be
explained? A remark from the <em>Commentary on the De anima</em>
(<em>In de Anima</em> 1.7&ndash;10) seems to suggest that at the time
Simplicius wrote, there existed several excellent commentaries on
Plato (by Syrianus, Proclus, and Damascius). However, a convincing
Neoplatonic answer to Alexander&rsquo;s Peripatetic reading of
Aristotle&rsquo;s major works was overdue. This was particularly
important, because Alexander first and foremost resisted strategies
aimed at incorporating Aristotle into the Platonic tradition.</p>

<p>
Given this context, it would have been interesting to know
Simplicius&rsquo; view of Syrianus&rsquo; (partial) <em>Commentary on
the Metaphysics</em>, given Syranius&rsquo; rather polemical approach
to Aristotle (Helmig 2009). In fact, there has been some discussion
about whether Simplicius himself might have authored a commentary on
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Metaphysics</em>, since such a work is mentioned
in the <em>Commentary on the De anima</em>. Unfortunately, however, if
he did, no fragments have survived (Goulet &amp; Coda 2016:
361&ndash;362).</p>

<p>
Altogether, four complete Simplicius commentaries on Aristotle have
come down to us: commentaries on Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Categories</em>, the <em>Physics</em>, the <em>De Caelo</em>, and
the <em>De anima</em>. However, many scholars doubt that the last of
these was composed by Simplicius himself (see
 <a href="#PseuSimpCommArisSoul">&sect;5</a>).
 We can determine the relative chronology of the first three
commentaries based on cross-references: Since the <em>Commentary on
the Categories</em> refers to the one on the <em>Physics</em> and the
<em>Commentary on the Physics</em> refers to the one on the <em>De
caelo</em> , it is very likely that the <em>Commentary on the De
caelo</em> was written first (Goulet &amp; Coda 2016: 364). It is less
clear, however, exactly when the commentaries would have been written.
Most scholars today agree with I. Hadot that Simplicius composed these
works after his journey to the Persian King. On the other hand, the
<em>Commentary on the De anima</em> could just as well be an early
work (see
 <a href="#PseuSimpCommArisSoul">&sect;5</a>),
 and when the <em>Commentary on Epictetus&rsquo; Handbook</em> was
written is a matter of debate.</p>

<h3 id="CommArisCate">1. Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em></h3>

<p>
Few people today would doubt that Aristotle composed his
<em>Categories</em> as an anti-Platonic manifesto. It seems to be a
conscious attempt to counter ontological claims related to
Plato&rsquo;s theory of Forms. The chapter on substance (ch. 5), the
distinction between a primary substance (sensible particulars) and
secondary substance (kinds, genera), and the priority given to the
former are particularly at variance with Plato&rsquo;s ontology. While
Plato considered universal terms in most cases to be transcendent
causes, Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em> treats them as
predicates of primary substances. Given this, it is rather surprising
that we find a tendency in Neoplatonism from Iamblichus onwards to
read the <em>Categories</em> as a work testifying to the harmony (in
the sense specified in
 <a href="index-2.html#HarmPlatArisChriThre">&sect;6</a>
 of the main article) of Plato and Aristotle.</p>

<p>
The insight that Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em> could also be
applied to the intelligible realm, something that Plotinus and his
pupil Porphyry still firmly rejected, was crucial for
Iamblichus&rsquo; approach (Strange 1987; however, see already
Plutarch, <em>De gen. an.</em> 1023D&ndash;F).
In <em>Ennead</em> VI 1&ndash;3,
Plotinus had argued that the Aristotelian categories could only
describe the physical world, whereas the highest genera in
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Sophist</em> ought to be considered the appropriate
categories for the intelligible. By means of his so-called <em>noera
the&ocirc;ria</em> (&ldquo;intellective theory&rdquo;; see Cardullo
1997; Dillon 1997; Opsomer 2016), Iamblichus was the first to suggest
that Aristotle also referred to the intelligible realm. The theory as
such must have come as something like the Copernican Revolution in the
attempts to harmonise Plato and Aristotle. Simplicius, unlike Syrianus
and Proclus, adopted Iamblichus&rsquo; view. Simplicius mainly follows
Iamblichus&rsquo; original idea, with several modifications (e.g.,
<em>In Cat.</em> 364.7 ff.).</p>

<p>
Simplicius&rsquo; <em>Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s Categories</em>
is the most comprehensive treatise on the <em>Categories</em> that has
come down to us from Antiquity. It is an indispensable source for
Neoplatonic and pre-Neoplatonic discussions of the work, even if it is
still somewhat unclear why the work was so popular among Peripatetics
of the Posthellenistic period (Griffin 2015). We know, for instance,
that Simplicius had first-hand access to Alexander&rsquo;s lost
commentary (<em>In Cat.</em> 41.21&ndash;24), and he mentions him
several times, although much less compared to his commentaries on
<em>the Physics</em> and <em>De caelo</em>. This does not mean,
however, that Alexander is an important source for or even an
authority in the <em>Commentary on the Categories</em> (Chiaradonna
2017: 159), as he is for the other two works. Simplicius firmly
disagrees, for instance, with Alexander and other Peripatetics on the
priority of primary substance over genera and species (see
 <a href="#SubsOusi">&sect;1.3</a>).</p>
 

<p>
The <em>Categories</em> secured a prominent position in the
Neoplatonic curriculum because it was the first of Aristotle&rsquo;s
texts, prefaced by Porphyry&rsquo;s <em>Isag&ocirc;g&ecirc;</em> (the
<em>Introduction</em> to the <em>Categories</em>), to be read in the
Platonic school. Aristotle was, in turn, considered an introduction to
Plato. Therefore, the <em>Categories</em> could be termed the
&ldquo;preface of the whole of philosophy&rdquo; (<em>prooimion
t&ecirc;s hol&ecirc;s philosophias</em>, <em>In Cat.</em> 1.4). We
only know of some ethical works, such as Hierocles&rsquo; commentary
on the <em>Golden Verses</em> and Epictetus&rsquo; <em>Handbook</em>,
that were taught before the actual curriculum to improve the character
of the student. Simplicius himself explains why the <em>Nicomachean
Ethics</em> could not be included among such works:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Some instruct us to begin with the ethical writings for they say that
instruments (<em>ta organa</em>) belong to the category of
intermediary things, and it is possible to use them either well or
badly, as is illustrated by the majority of Sophists and rhetoricians.
Thus, people who are going to use instruments first have need of a
life which is moderately prepared, for the knowledge of philosophy is
not like that of architecture or navigation; rather, it has to do with
life itself (<em>z&ocirc;tik&ecirc;</em>). </p>

<p>
We first require the training which comes from the ethical works, in
which we receive ethical teachings not demonstratively, but in
conformity with correct opinion, in accordance with the natural innate
concepts we have concerning beings. If Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Ethics</em> were merely hortatory and undemonstrated catechisms,
of the kind that used often to be uttered by the Pythagoreans [sc. the
so-called <em>Golden Verses</em>, CH], it would be correct to start
with them and use them to give preliminary training to our characters.
</p>

<p>
If, however, Aristotle handed down these things, too, by means of the
most scientific of divisions and demonstrations, how could we hope to
make any progress by approaching these writings without the
demonstrative methods? Perhaps, then, some previous ethical
instruction is necessary after all, but it should not be transmitted
by means of Aristotle&rsquo;s ethical writings. Rather, [such
instruction should be provided] through unwritten habituation and
non-technical exhortations, which rectify our characters by means both
written and unwritten. (Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em> 5.16&ndash;6.3,
translated by M. Chase)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Simplicius&rsquo; text makes it clear why Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Organon</em> ought to be read before approaching the
<em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>: Aristotle&rsquo;s main philosophical
works presuppose skills in logic (demonstration), which can be
acquired by studying his logical works.</p>

<p>
Regarding the <em>Categories</em>, it is noteworthy that Simplicius
(as well as other Neoplatonists before him) does not advocate a merely
logical interpretation of the work, but rather emphasises at the
outset that it also deals with first causes (<em>pr&ocirc;tai
archai</em>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Many authors have set forth many speculations on Aristotle&rsquo;s
book of Categories. This is so not only because it is the prologue to
the whole of philosophy (since it is the beginning of the study of
logic, and logic, in turn, is rightly taken up prior to the whole of
philosophy), but also because the Categories is, in a sense, about the
first principles (<em>archai</em>), as we shall see in our discussion
of the goal (<em>skopos</em>). (Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em>
1.3&ndash;7, translated by M. Chase)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
If the <em>Categories</em> are also about first causes, we may ask
what distinguishes them from the <em>Metaphysics</em>. As a
Neoplatonist, Simplicius is committed to a non-developmentalist
approach to Aristotle. Accordingly, unlike most modern scholars, he
thinks that the two works are consistent with each other. He even
asserts that Aristotle provides his &ldquo;most complete
discussion&rdquo; of ten categories in the <em>Metaphysics</em>
(<em>In Cat.</em> 295.13&ndash;14), while the <em>Categories</em> have
an introductory character. Like Porphyry, Simplicius considers the
<em>Categories</em> a work for beginners (Porphyry, <em>In Cat.</em>
59.21&ndash;22 and Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em> 3.15; 264.4;
295.7&ndash;9; 427.2). While the <em>Metaphysics</em> investigates
beings <em>qua</em> beings, the categories are not identical with the
beings themselves (whether sensible or intelligible), but are rather
expressions &ldquo;that <em>signify</em> realities&rdquo; (Simplicius,
<em>In Cat.</em> 42.4). For instance, the categories <em>pote</em>
(&ldquo;when&rdquo;) and <em>pou</em> (&ldquo;where&rdquo;) are not
identical with &ldquo;time&rdquo; and &ldquo;place&rdquo;, but signify
&ldquo;things (in time) in relation to time&rdquo; and &ldquo;things
(in place) in relation to place&rdquo; (without being simply
&ldquo;relatives&rdquo; [<em>ta pros ti</em>] in the sense of the
<em>Categories</em>). The two works, the <em>Categories</em> and the
<em>Metaphysics</em>, discuss the principles (<em>archai</em>) in a
different way, from two different perspectives:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For the principles (<em>archai</em>) are made clear, so far as their
significant expression (<em>s&ecirc;mantik&ecirc; lexis</em>) is
concerned, in the logical treatise (i.e., the <em>Categories</em>); as
regards the objects signified (<em>s&ecirc;mainomena pragmata</em>),
they are appropriately expounded in the <em>Metaphysics</em>.
(Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em> 295.14&ndash;16, translated by R.
Gaskin)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This brings us to the <em>skopos</em>, or the main and
all-encompassing (i.e., including all parts of the
<em>Categories</em>) topic of the work (<em>In Cat.</em>
9.4&ndash;13.26). In the rich commentary tradition before Simplicius,
several options had been suggested regarding the subject or topic of
the treatise: The <em>Categories</em> could be about either (a) words
(<em>ph&ocirc;nai</em>), (b) beings/beings <em>qua</em> beings
(<em>onta h&ecirc;i onta</em>), or (c) thoughts/concepts
(<em>no&ecirc;mata</em>). Simplicius&rsquo; own solution, which builds
upon Porphyry, can be considered a synthesis of all three options:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Since it has been shown that the goal (<em>skopos</em>) is about words
(<em>ph&ocirc;nai</em>), but some words are simple and others
compound, it is about simple, primary words which signify the primary
and most generic (<em>genik&ocirc;tata</em>) of beings (<em>ta
onta</em>) by means of simple, primary concepts
(<em>no&ecirc;mata</em>). (Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em>
13.18&ndash;21, translated by M. Chase, slightly modified)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Simplicius is, of course, aware of the commentary on the
<em>Categories</em> before him. His discussion of the topic
(<em>skopos</em>) and the introductory section (<em>In Cat.</em>
1.8&ndash;2.29) taken together can be considered a short history of
his predecessors&rsquo; most important views. The rich tradition
before Simplicius prompts him to explain why he is adding yet another
commentary on top of what his Neoplatonic predecessors Plotinus,
Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Syrianus have already produced. As with the
<em>Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s De anima</em> (see
 <a href="#PseuSimpCommArisSoul">&sect;5</a>),
 it is first and foremost Iamblichus who provided the basis for
Simplicius&rsquo; own commentary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Since, then, there has been so much interest in the
<em>Categories</em> on the part of the most illustrious philosophers,
I should straight away appear ridiculous for having dared to have
written something myself as well, unless I were to show that the cause
of my audacity was reasonable.</p>

<p>
Now, I have read some of the aforementioned writings, and, following
Iamblichus as carefully as possible, I wrote them down, often even
using the philosopher&rsquo;s very words. My goal (<em>skopos</em>) in
making this copy was, in the first place, to obtain, through the act
of writing, as accurate a comprehension (<em>katano&ecirc;sis</em>) as
possible of what had been said. At the same time, I wished to reduce
this man&rsquo;s lofty spirit (<em>hups&ecirc;los nous</em>),
inaccessible to the common people, until it was more clear and
commensurate [with the common understanding]. Thirdly, I also wanted
to reduce somewhat the vast multitude of variegated writings; not, as
the most philosophical Syrianus did, to an absolute minimum, but as
far as was compatible while leaving out nothing necessary.</p>

<p>
If I, too, have been able to add something, then I owe gratitude to
these men for this as well, after the gods; for it was guided by them
that I have added the occasional problem (<em>aporia</em>) of some
value, or some articulation (<em>diarthr&ocirc;sis</em>) worthy of
what has been said which is worthy of the rational principle
(<em>logos</em>). Nevertheless, I advise my readers never to disdain
the writings especially of Porphyry and Iamblichus in favour of these
little scholia (<em>ta scholika</em>), but rather, if at all, to use
them as an introduction and training for a clearer comprehension of
what those men have said. (Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em>
2.30&ndash;3.17, translated by M. Chase; for Iamblichus as source, see
also <em>In Cat.</em> 438.33&ndash;36)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In view of all that had been written on the <em>Categories</em>,
Simplicius was afraid to appear ridiculous in composing yet another
commentary. In order to justify his undertaking, he lists several
points that distinguish his work from previous attempts to explain the
<em>Categories</em>. First and foremost, he aims at grasping the
meaning of the text as accurately as possible. This was certainly a
common objective of most of the commentators, except for those who
were replying to Aristotle, engaging in polemics, or simply raising
difficulties (as was apparently the case for Lucius and Nicostratus,
<em>In Cat.</em> 1.18&ndash;22). Although Simplicius follows
Iamblichus, frequently to the letter (<em>aut&ecirc;i t&ecirc;i lexei
chr&ecirc;samenos</em>), he is eager to &ldquo;reduce this man&rsquo;s
lofty spirit, inaccessible to the common people&rdquo;. The latter
points to the fact that time and again, Simplicius improves on
Iamblichus&rsquo; exegesis (see, e.g., Hoffmann 2000a on the
categories <em>pote</em> and <em>pou</em> and Schwark 2018 on issues
concerning quality) and also criticises his &ldquo;intellective
theory&rdquo; (<em>noera the&ocirc;ria</em>; <em>In Cat.</em> 364.7
ff.). Simplicius also aims at a useful summary of the history of the
commentary tradition, reducing its quantity but &ldquo;leaving out
nothing necessary&rdquo;, and he adds some difficulties with and
articulation of the argument. The former appears to refer to his
method of &ldquo;problems and solutions&rdquo; (<em>aporiai kai
luseis</em>), which he inherited from Damascius (see
 <a href="index-2.html#HowCommArisNeop">&sect;4 in the main article</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Given Iamblichus&rsquo; importance for Simplicius, what were his
merits compared to Porphyry and other predecessors?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
After Porphyry, the divine Iamblichus also devoted a lengthy treatise
to this book. For the most part, he followed Porphyry right down to
the letter, but he picked out some things and articulated them in
order to make them more clear. At the same time, he contracted the
scholastic long-windedness Porphyry had used against the objections;
and he applied his Intellective Theory (<em>noera the&ocirc;ria</em>)
everywhere, to almost all of the chapter-headings. (Simplicius, <em>In
Cat.</em> 2.9&ndash;14, translated by M. Chase)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another feature of Iamblichus&rsquo; commentary proved rather
influential for Simplicius&rsquo; own work. It has long been observed
that Iamblichus was particularly fond of the Pythagorean tradition. He
is one of the best examples of &ldquo;Pythagorizing tendencies&rdquo;
(O&rsquo;Meara 1989) in
Neoplatonism. There are indications in Simplicius&rsquo; writings that
he, like Syrianus and Proclus before him, considered Plato
particularly close to the Pythagorean tradition (e.g., <em>In
Phys.</em> 8.2&ndash;3: &ldquo;[&hellip;] Plato, which is the same as
to say the Pythagoreans&rdquo;). As he states explicitly, Simplicius
took from Iamblichus&rsquo; <em>Commentary on the Categories</em> the
idea that Pseudo-Archytas&rsquo; <em>Peri tou katholou logou</em> was
the main source of Aristotle&rsquo;s own categories (Gavray 2011a).
Although we know today that the work is a forgery, probably from the
first century BC (Szlez&aacute;k 1972: 13&ndash;14), Neoplatonists
considered it to stem from the Presocratic era. The following two
excerpts illustrate well Pseudo-Archytas&rsquo; importance for
Simplicius:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In addition, he [sc. Iamblichus] also added something else to his
writing which was useful: for even before Aristotle, the Pythagorean
Archytas, in the book he entitled <em>On the All</em>, had already
divided the primary genera into ten, and had clearly explained, with
the help of examples, their distinctive tokens
(<em>gn&ocirc;rismata</em>), and had indicated the order
(<em>taxis</em>) they occupy with regard to one another, and the
specific differences of each [genus], as well as their common and
individual properties.</p>

<p>
Iamblichus, then, adduced the considerations of Archytas in the
appropriate places, unfolding that which had been intellectively
concentrated, and demonstrating their accord with the doctrines of
Aristotle. If there happened to be anything discordant between
them&mdash;there are few such instances&mdash;then he brought these
differences, too, to the attention of lovers of knowledge; nor did he
leave the cause of the discord unexamined. Rightly so, for it is
obvious that Aristotle always wants to remain faithful to Archytas.
(Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em> 2.14&ndash;25, translated by M.
Chase)</p>

<p>
Now, the Pythagoreans gathered together the simple entities into the
decade, as was taught by Archytas, with whom Plato, too, was
acquainted, in his book <em>On the Universal Formulae</em> (<em>Peri
t&ocirc;n katholou log&ocirc;n</em>). Aristotle, too, followed him
right down to the names [he gave to his categories]; according to some
people, the only point at which Aristotle deviated [from Archytas] is
that he did not take into consideration the One, which contains the
ten [categories], and that he rejects the natural character of names.
(Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em> 13.21&ndash;26, translated by M.
Chase)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It was by no means uncommon among Neoplatonic authors to appreciate
what were considered philosophical authorities from Pythagoras&rsquo;
alleged circle. Another well-known example is the
<em>Epitom&ecirc;</em> of parts of Plato&rsquo;s <em>Timaeus</em> by a
certain Timaeus of Locri. Proclus considered the latter the literary
model and source for Plato and reports that some people even accused
Plato of having plagiarised Pseudo-Timaeus (Proclus, <em>In Tim.</em> I
1.1&ndash;16). Archytas fits
Simplicius&rsquo; scheme of the basic harmony of the Hellenic
tradition well. Accordingly, Simplicius emphasises that Iamblichus
already demonstrated the consistency of Aristotle and Archytas (<em>In
Cat.</em> 2.14&ndash;25).</p>

<p>
As we have seen, Simplicius&rsquo; main aim is to show that there is a
baseline agreement of Archytas, Plotinus, and Iamblichus with
Aristotle and Plato. This is not an easy task, because (1)
(Pseudo)-Archytas reads the <em>Categories</em> from a Middle-Platonic
perspective, concentrating mainly on the intelligibles as the primary
object of study, and (2) Plotinus, in contrast, betrays a rather
critical approach to Aristotle in his <em>Genera of Being</em> (VI
1&ndash;3, [42&ndash;44]) and questions several of his arguments
(ultimately reducing the categories to five), while (3) Iamblichus
harmonises Aristotle and his allegedly Pythagorean source Archytas and
argues, via his intellective theory (<em>noera the&ocirc;ria</em>),
that the categories refer to both sensible and intelligible entities.
Simplicius does an admirable job of weaving all these traditions
together, one of his main argumentative strategies being that these
philosophers had approached the problem of the categories from rather
different perspectives with diverging aims.</p>

<p>
A good example of Simplicius&rsquo; approach is how he deals with the
structure of the entire work (<em>dihairesis</em>). According to
Simplicius, the work falls into three parts. In the first part
(<em>Cat.</em> 1&ndash;4). </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Aristotle articulates a few matters which will be useful for the
categories: for instance, what are homonyms, synonyms, and paronyms.
(<em>In Cat.</em> 19.9&ndash;11) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The second part (<em>Cat.</em> 5&ndash;10) discusses the ten
categories or genera themselves, while the third part </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
deals with some matters which Aristotle had already mentioned in his
discussion of the categories; here, however, he transmits to us a
clearer conception of them. (<em>In Cat.</em> 19.17&ndash;19;
referring to <em>Cat.</em> 11&ndash;15, the so-called
<em>post-praedicamenta</em>) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Simplicius observes that Aristotle treated the first four categories
(substance, quantity, relation, and quality) in a much more detailed
manner than the remaining six:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Since the four of the ten genera which he has already gone through are
more general and admit of a more ample theory, they were deemed by
Aristotle worthy of an extended account; and he will [now] speak of
the remaining ones, even if in a more concise manner. (Simplicius,
<em>In Cat.</em> 295.4&ndash;6, translated by R. Gaskin)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Against this background, Simplicius himself observes a difference in
the order in which Aristotle and his alleged source, Archytas, deal
with the first four categories. In Aristotle, substance (ch. 5 of the
commentary) is discussed before quantity (ch. 6), relation (ch. 7),
and quality (ch. 8). While Aristotle does not explicitly discuss the
order of the categories, Simplicius tries to establish a sequence
according to the relation or closeness to substance or the essence of
a substrate (<em>pros t&ecirc;n ousian oikeiot&ecirc;s</em>, <em>In
Cat.</em> 156.11&ndash;14), with the resulting order being: substance,
quality, quantity, relation. He explains that his order differs from
Aristotle&rsquo;s because Aristotle focuses on or
&ldquo;prefers&rdquo; (<em>protim&ocirc;n</em>) sensible substance
(<em>In Cat.</em> 157.23&ndash;33).</p>

<p>
As we learn from the preface, one of the main aims of the entire
commentary is to gain a better understanding of Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Categories</em>. For Neoplatonists, since they read Aristotle in a
non-developmentalist way, this entails demonstrating that he is
coherent with himself in the <em>Categories</em> and elsewhere, for
instance, in the <em>Metaphysics</em>. As we learn from
Simplicius&rsquo; preface, Lucius, and after him Nicostratus (see
Praechter 1922; Griffin 2015: 103&ndash;128), raised a series of
difficulties (<em>aporiai</em>, <em>In Cat.</em> 1.18&ndash;22) that
the subsequent commentary tradition tried to solve. We know from
Simplicius himself, for instance, that one of his most important
sources, Porphyry, solved <em>all</em> of these difficulties in his
now lost commentary <em>Ad Gedalium</em> (<em>In Cat.</em>
2.5&ndash;8) (Chase 2000). Typical issues in this regard included the
number of the categories, i.e., whether they are exactly ten (or more
or less&mdash;Plotinus, for instance, argued that five categories are
sufficient), the order of the categories, as mentioned above, which
phenomena ought to be classified in which categories (e.g., whether
time and place should be classified under quantity or under
&ldquo;when&rdquo; [<em>pote</em>] and &ldquo;where&rdquo;
[<em>pou</em>]), the nature and origin of essential qualities (see
Hauer 2018), the problem of substance (<em>ousia</em>), the definition
of relatives (<em>pros ti</em>) in Plato and Aristotle, and the status
and kinds of relatives (Luna 1987; Harari 2009).</p>

<p>
The following subsections discuss three selected topics from from
Simplicius&rsquo; <em>Commentary on the Categories</em>.</p>

<h4 id="MethPremDefiVsDesc">1.1 A methodological premise (definition vs. description)</h4>

<p>
Simplicius&rsquo; reading of Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Categories</em> is
based on a rather simple insight. Since the categories are the
highest, most universal genera, they cannot be defined by means of the
traditional (Aristotelian) scheme of genus and specific difference,
because we would then have to posit even more general universals
(<em>genera</em>) above them. Therefore, Simplicius argues, Aristotle
chose not definition, but &ldquo;description&rdquo;
(<em>hypograph&ecirc;</em>, Narbonne 1987) to differentiate between
the categories by looking at the properties they all have in common
and the differences proper to each of them (&ldquo;common and
particular features&rdquo; [<em>idia kai koina hyparchonta</em>],
<em>In Cat.</em> 92.3&ndash;4). Since the categories are the most
universal, demonstration (apodeictic syllogism, <em>apodeixis</em>) is
also not a suitable method for obtaining them. According to
Simplicius, Aristotle uses the method of induction
(<em>epag&ocirc;g&ecirc;</em>, <em>epagein</em>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;Account&rdquo; (<em>logos</em>) means the calculation of votes,
and it also means internal discourse in accordance with the concept
(<em>ennoia</em>); it also means external discourse as well as
spermatic reason, and it also means the guiding and definitory formula
of each thing. He said &ldquo;account&rdquo; (<em>logos</em>) rather
than &ldquo;definition&rdquo; (<em>horismos</em>), in order to include
the descriptive account as well, which fits both with the highest
genera and with individuals; these cannot be included by a definition
(<em>horismos</em>), since it is not possible to take either a genus
of the highest genera, nor differentiae of individuals. Descriptions
(<em>hupographai</em>), by contrast, which give an account of the
characteristic property (<em>idiot&ecirc;s</em>) of a substance,
extend to these as well. (Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em> 29.13&ndash;25,
translated by M. Chase)</p>

<p>
Aristotle made this convincing (<em>poiein t&ecirc;n pistin</em>)
admirably by means of induction (<em>epag&ocirc;g&ecirc;</em>); for he
points out the highest genera by means of what is below them and what
is more divisible than them. For it is not possible to produce a proof
(<em>apodeixis</em>) by syllogism by taking anything more general than
them; but we should apprehend (<em>epibol&ecirc;</em>) them from what
is posterior and more partial as if it were evident and credible in
itself. (Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em> 190.25&ndash;30, translated by
B. Fleet, modified)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="FormSoulLang">1.2 Forms, soul, language</h4>

<p>
As part of the introduction, Simplicius presents an interesting theory
of the origin of language and links to the crucial role of language in
philosophical education (<em>In Cat.</em> 12.13&ndash;13.11; Hoffmann
1987b: 83&ndash;90). Invoking the Neoplatonic doctrine that all things
derive from a transcendent first principle beyond being, the One, he
argues that as with all other things, we can also consider language as
emerging on a certain level of reality. On the level of intellect,
where thinking is identical with its object, there is no need for
language, as it is an undifferentiated unity (<em>adiakritos
hen&ocirc;sis</em>). Language proper originates on the level of soul
which is characterised by means of its discursive activity
(<em>dianoia</em>). Compared to intellect, there is a much stronger
differentiation here. This is paralleled in other Neoplatonists.
Unlike intellect, discursive thought apprehends its objects in a
temporal sequence, one after the other, and therefore, already in
Plotinus, soul is called <em>logos</em> (&ldquo;discursive rational
principle&rdquo;, <em>Ennead</em> IV 6 [41] 3.5&ndash;7). In Proclus, the discursive nature of soul is
illustrated rather well:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For Proclus, the knowledge proper to the soul is discursive reasoning
(<em>dianoia</em>). As psychic knowledge is essentially discursive it
can therefore be termed &ldquo;discourse&rdquo; (<em>logos</em>). The
activity of <em>logos</em> is to &ldquo;discourse&rdquo; or to
&ldquo;speak&rdquo; (<em>legein</em>). But discoursing always entails
both separation and movement in time. While intellect knows everything
at once and in an undivided manner, soul can only know things
consecutively, one after another. [&hellip;] In contrast to intellect,
which apprehends its objects simultaneously (&ldquo;all at
once&rdquo;) and thus transcends time, all discursive knowledge takes
place in time. (Helmig 2012: 264)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Simplicius connects the origin of language, or the need
(<em>chreia</em>) for language, with the so-called &ldquo;fall of the
soul&rdquo;&mdash;the fact that the soul alienates itself from its
true separate essence as an intelligible entity and connects to a body
(described in great detail in the <em>Commentary on the De anima</em>;
see
 <a href="#PseuSimpCommArisSoul">&sect;5</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Neoplatonic commentaries betray a characteristically didactic
dimension. From Plotinus onwards, works and commentaries are
structured in a way that mirrors the ascent of the soul and hence its
cognitive development. Especially in Proclus, but also in the
tradition after him, there is an entire stock of vocabulary to
describe the conversion of the soul by means of the articulation of
innate concepts (<em>ennoiai</em> or <em>logoi</em>; see Helmig 2012:
263&ndash;304), which is considered part of recollection
(<em>anamn&ecirc;sis</em>). In the passage on the origin of language,
Simplicius makes ample use of this vocabulary. For him, it is language
that &ldquo;converts the soul&rdquo; (Griffin 2018):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Intellect, being identical with realities and with intellection,
possesses as one both beings and the notions of them, by virtue of its
undifferentiated unity, and there [sc. in the intelligible world]
there is no need for language. [&hellip;] When, however, the soul has
fallen into the realm of becoming, it is filled with forgetfulness,
and requires sight and hearing in order to be able to recollect
(<em>anamn&ecirc;sis</em>). For the soul needs someone who has already
beheld the truth, who, by means of language
(<em>ph&ocirc;n&ecirc;</em>) uttered forth from the concept
(<em>ennoia</em>), also moves the concept within [the soul of the
student], which had until then grown cold. This, then, is how the need
for language (<em>ph&ocirc;n&ecirc;</em>) came about. [&hellip;]. For
intellections (<em>no&ecirc;seis</em>) which proceed forth from other
intellections also set in motion immediately, and they join the
learner&rsquo;s to those of the teacher, by becoming intermediaries
(<em>mesot&ecirc;tes</em>) between the two. When intellections are set
in motion in an appropriate way, they adjust themselves to realities,
and thus there comes about the knowledge of beings (<em>ta onta</em>),
and the soul&rsquo;s spontaneous (<em>autophu&ecirc;s</em>)
<em>er&ocirc;s</em> is fulfilled. (Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em>,
12.13&ndash;13.4, translated by M. Chase, slightly modified)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As we have seen, this passage presupposes the theory of recollection
and hence a theory of innate knowledge. In Neoplatonism, this innate
knowledge basically consists of a (discursive) blueprint of the Forms.
Compared to intellect, however, for the soul there is a characteristic
distinction between subject and objects of knowledge:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
As for the soul, when it is converted towards the Intellect, it
possesses the same things [sc. as the Intellect] in a secondary way,
for then the rational principles (<em>logoi</em>) within it are not
only cognitive, but generative. Once, however, the soul has departed
from there [sc. the intelligible world], it also separates the innate
reason principles (<em>logoi</em>) within itself from beings, thereby
converting them into images (<em>eikones</em>) instead of prototypes
(<em>pr&ocirc;totupoi</em>), and it introduces a distance between
intellection (<em>no&ecirc;sis</em>) and realities
(<em>pragmata</em>). (Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em>, 12.19&ndash;23,
translated by M. Chase, slightly modified)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Platonic Forms can appear on all levels of reality (intellect, soul,
nature, or as enmattered Forms in things). In a well-known, rather
programmatic passage in this regard, Simplicius distinguishes between
three kinds of universals or &ldquo;commons&rdquo; (<em>koina</em>):
the transcendent Form, the enmattered Form, and the abstracted
universal:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Perhaps one should take &ldquo;common item&rdquo; (<em>koinon</em>) in
three ways, the first transcending the individuals and being the cause
of the common item in them in virtue of its single nature, as it is
also the cause of the difference &lt;between them&gt; in virtue of its
pre-encompassing (<em>prol&ecirc;psis</em>) many species. For example,
in virtue of the single nature of animal the first animal, i.e., the
Animal-Itself, endows all animals qua animals with the common item
they share, and in virtue of its pre-encompassing the different
species it establishes the different species of animals. The second
common item is the one that the different species are endowed with by
their common cause and which resides in them, like the one (sc. common
item) in each animal. The third is the common feature established in
our thoughts by means of abstraction (<em>aphairesis</em>), which is
later-born (<em>husterogenes</em>) and most of all admits of the
notion of the non-differentiated and common feature. (Simplicius,
<em>In Cat.</em>, 82.35&ndash;83.10, translated by F. A. J. de Haas,
slightly modified) </p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="SubsOusi">1.3 Substance (<em>ousia</em>)</h4>

<p>
The nature of universals was a highly contested topic between the
Peripatetics and Neoplatonists. If the <em>Categories</em> is read as
a conscious attempt to counter claims about Plato&rsquo;s ontology, it
is not surprising that Aristotle asserts that sensible particulars
(first substances) have priority over second substances (genera and
species) and the other categories, because the latter are
ontologically dependent on them. For Simplicius, who vigorously
defends the harmony of Plato and Aristotle, the claim of the priority
of sensible particulars over universals is a serious concern. As a
matter of fact, he rebukes Alexander and other Peripatetics for
it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
However, Alexander contentiously (<em>philoneikei</em>) claims that
here universals are posterior (<em>hustera</em>) to particulars by
nature as well, &lt;a claim&gt; for which he hardly provides any proof
but, taking up his initial &lt;statement&gt; that universals (<em>ta
koina</em>) derive their being and substance (<em>einai kai
ousia</em>) from individuals, he does not add any proof thereof
[&hellip;]. (Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em>, 82.22&ndash;24, translated
by F. A. J. de Haas) </p>

<p>
However, Alexander claims that the intelligible and separate form is
called individual substance as well, and this is probably
characteristic of the Peripatos, since &lt;on their view&gt; the
universals are not in existence (<em>en hupostasei</em>) independently
at all, but have their being in the individuals. If, then, the
separate forms are in existence most of all, they would be individuals
and not universals. (Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em>, 82.6&ndash;10,
translated by F. A. J. de Haas)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As would be expected, such criticism can also be found in other
Neoplatonic commentators on the <em>Categories</em> (see, for
instance, Dexippus, <em>In Cat.</em> 45.15&ndash;31) Simplicius
resolves the tension by claiming that while the Peripatos got it all
wrong, Aristotle himself introduced the priority of first substances
only in relation to us. That is, Aristotle did not hold the view that
they are prior according to nature, but they are just the first things
that we encounter in the world around us:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Regarding the same problem the question is also raised why, in the
Physics, &lt;Aristotle&gt; classes the universals as prior, but here
the individuals. Well, because prior and secondary are said in two
ways, either by nature or in relation to us: in relation to us the
particulars (<em>ta kath&rsquo; hekasta</em>) are prior, for we
encounter them first. But by nature the universals (<em>ta koina</em>)
are prior, for the individuals are classed below the universals
(<em>ta katholou</em>). So if one starts from nature, one will class
as prior the simple &lt;entities&gt;, the causes, the universals
(<em>ta katholou</em>), the immaterial, the undivided and suchlike.
But since the order is here derived from the semantic relation, the
first will be chosen in relation to us. (Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em>,
82.14&ndash;22, translated by F.A.J. de Haas)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Today, it would be difficult to convince Aristotle scholars that he
prioritised genera and species to sensible individuals. Note, however,
that Aristotle&rsquo;s alleged source, Pseudo-Archytas, also puts the
commons (<em>ta koina</em>) before particulars (<em>In Cat.</em>
91.14&ndash;33).</p>

<h3 id="CommArisPhys">2. Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em></h3>

<p>
Simplicius&rsquo; <em>Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s Physics</em> is
undoubtedly his major work. The almost 1500 pages of the Berlin
<em>Commentaria in Aristotelem Graeca</em> (CAG), edited by Hermann
Diels, is, together with Proclus&rsquo; <em>Commentary on the
Timaeus</em>, one of the two most important sources for Neoplatonic
views on nature. In addition, Simplicius preserved verbatim a great
number of Presocratic quotations and most interesting fragments from
the Peripatetic school. His main interlocutor throughout seems to be
Alexander of Aphrodisias, and although the latter&rsquo;s commentary
is lost, it can be partially reconstructed from Simplicius and
Byzantine scholia (M. Rashed 2011).</p>

<p>
The commentary starts with an obligatory preface (<em>In Phys.</em>
1.4&ndash;8.30) which discusses seven issues related to the commentary
(the <em>skopos</em>, how natural philosophy is structured, the name
of the work [<em>aitia epigraph&ecirc;s</em>], its usefulness
[<em>chr&ecirc;simon</em>], its place in the order of reading
[<em>taxis anagn&ocirc;se&ocirc;s</em>], its authenticity
[<em>gn&ecirc;sion</em>], and the structure of the work
[<em>dihairesis eis kephalaia</em>]) and also provides a short history
of natural science prior to Aristotle as well as a nice anecdote on
the difference between Aristotle&rsquo;s exoteric and his acroamatic
writings (those published for a wider audience and those only aimed at
the members of his school or his direct listeners).</p>

<p>
As noted earlier, Simplicius follows Iamblichus&rsquo; precept that
one ought to determine one main topic (<em>skopos</em>) that holds the
whole work together, but this seems rather difficult in the case of
the <em>Physics</em>. Simplicius therefore opts for the following:
&ldquo;the ones which belong in common to all natural things&mdash;or
which seem to, but don&rsquo;t&rdquo; (<em>In Phys.</em> 4.6&ndash;7,
translated by R. Barney and S. Menn). Especially the latter part
sounds slightly curious, and so it is worth remembering how he arrives
at this solution (<em>In Phys.</em> 3.13&ndash;4.7). As Aristotle
states, one knows a thing if one knows its causes. Hence the
<em>Physics</em> is about the common causes of natural things qua
natural (i.e., bodily), but also about the concomitants
(<em>parakolouthounta</em>) of these causes. The latter are movement,
time, and place, but also the continuous (<em>suneches</em>), because
bodies and all the concomitants of natural causes are continuous.
Aristotle discussed the void and the infinite in the <em>Physics</em>,
especially because they play a role in Presocratic philosophy, but he
concludes that they do not exist. Hence, they only <em>seem</em> to
belong to all natural things.</p>

<p>
Regarding the title of the work (<em>aitia epigraph&ecirc;s</em>), the
<em>Physics</em> was referred to in different ways by Aristotelian
commentators. It was called either &ldquo;Lecture on Nature&rdquo;
(<em>Phusik&ecirc; Akroasis</em>), &ldquo;On Principles&rdquo;
(<em>peri arch&ocirc;n</em>), or &lt;Eight Books&gt; &ldquo;of the
Lecture on Nature&rdquo; (<em>Phusik&ecirc;s Akroase&ocirc;s</em>),
while some called the first five books &ldquo;On Principles&rdquo; and
the last three &ldquo;On Movement&rdquo; (<em>peri
kin&ecirc;se&ocirc;s</em>).</p>

<p>
As with his <em>Commentary on De caelo</em>, how Simplicius defines
the usefulness (<em>chr&ecirc;simon</em>) of the <em>Physics</em> is
quite remarkable. To Simplicius, natural science is important for
medicine, mechanics, and other crafts, while nature (<em>phusis</em>),
through its ordered internal processes, can teach us several virtues
(such as justice, honesty, courage, and temperance). The greatest
good, however, is that the study of nature instills admiration for the
Maker of the universe (cf. Simplicius, <em>In Cael.</em>
731.25&ndash;29) and teaches us the principles of the entire science
of nature:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But the greatest good of it is that it is the finest path to the
knowledge of the substance of the soul and the study of the separate
and divine forms, as Plato too makes clear when he proceeds from
natural motions towards the discovery of the self-moved substance and
of the intellectual and divine existence, and also Aristotle when in
this very treatise he seeks out the unmoved cause of all motion
starting from the eternity of the circular motion.</p>

<p>
It also especially kindles reverence towards the divine superiority,
awakening us well to the wonder and majesty of the Maker (<em>ho
poi&ecirc;sas</em>) from a precise grasp of the things made by him.
Affinity towards God and steadfast trust and hope follow together upon
this wonder. For these reasons above all one must practise the study
of nature. So then since the study of nature is so valuable, the
present treatise would rightly be most valuable, since it teaches us
the principles of the whole study of nature (<em>hai archai t&ecirc;s
hol&ecirc;s phusiologias</em>), principles without which it is
impossible to have scientific knowledge
(<em>epist&ecirc;m&ecirc;</em>) of nature, as Aristotle himself has
indicated by saying, immediately at the beginning of the text,
&ldquo;we think that we know (<em>gign&ocirc;skein</em>) each thing
when we recognise (<em>gn&ocirc;rizein</em>) its first causes and
first principles and as far as the elements&rdquo;. (Simplicius,
<em>In Phys.</em> 5.10&ndash;26, translated by S. Menn and R.
Barney)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Simplicius determines the <em>Physics</em>&rsquo; place in the order
of reading [<em>taxis anagn&ocirc;se&ocirc;s</em>] as coming before
all other works on natural philosophy, since it is about the very
principles of natural philosophy&mdash;and natural philosophy, in
turn, should be approached after the ethical and logical treatises
have been read.</p>

<p>
The authenticity (<em>gn&ecirc;sion</em>) of the <em>Physics</em> is
taken for granted for three reasons: No one has questioned it,
Aristotle refers to it several times in his genuine works, and his
entire school refers to it. The structure of the <em>Physics</em>
(<em>dihairesis eis kephalaia</em>) is usually considered to be
bipartite, with the first four or five books on natural principles and
the last four or three on movement. Simplicius is aware of both ways
of dividing the books (the first at <em>In Phys.</em> 4.14&ndash;15
and 6.9&ndash;10, and the second at <em>In Phys.</em> 802.811 [where
it is attributed to Porphyry] and <em>In Cael.</em> 226.19&ndash;21
[cf. Philoponus, <em>In Phys.</em> 2.16&ndash;21]). At <em>In
Phys.</em> 6.10&ndash;30, Simplicius provides a useful summary of the
first five books, asserting that the fifth book distinguishes
locomotion from all other kinds of change.</p>

<p>
The following subsections discuss a selection of the
<em>Commentary</em>&rsquo;s general topics.</p>

<h4 id="NeopTheoCaus">2.1 Neoplatonic theory of causes</h4>

<p>
To better understand Simplicius&rsquo; take on the <em>Physics</em>,
it is important to observe that he approaches the work with a strictly
Neoplatonic theory of causality. Such a theory can be found in much
detail in his predecessor Proclus, who distinguishes between causes in
the proper sense (<em>archai kai aitia</em>) and so-called auxiliary
causes (<em>sunaitia</em>). Simplicius writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But the object (<em>skopos</em>) of the treatise at hand is to teach
concerning the things which belong in general to all natural things
inasmuch as they are natural&mdash;that is to say, bodily. And what
belongs in general to all are the principles, and the concomitants of
the principles. And the principles are the causes strictly speaking
and the auxiliary causes (<em>sunaitia</em>); and the causes,
according to them, are the efficient and the final, and the auxiliary
causes, the form and matter and the elements generally
(<em>hol&ocirc;s</em>&mdash;note that, strictly speaking, Aristotle
also considers privation [<em>ster&ecirc;sis</em>] a cause). But Plato
adds the paradigmatic as a cause, and the instrumental as an auxiliary
cause. (<em>In Phys.</em> 3.13&ndash;19, translated by R. Barney and
S. Menn; cf. <em>In Phys.</em> 26.5&ndash;7)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hence, the paradigmatic (i.e., the Platonic Forms) and the
instrumental cause are added to the four traditional Aristotelian
causes (efficient, material, formal, final). It is important to
emphasise that for the Neoplatonists, causes proper transcend their
effects, that is, they cannot be immanent in things such as form and
matter. Proclus had argued this at length in his <em>Elements of
Theology</em> (prop. 75), and
Simplicius agrees with him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he properly efficient cause must be separate and transcendent from
the effect, for the cause immanent in the effect, such as the form and
nature, comes close to the formal principle. (Simplicius, <em>In
Phys.</em> 315.10&ndash;12, trans. by author)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="ArisPhysPlatTima">2.2 Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em> and Plato&rsquo;s <em>Timaeus</em></h4>

<p>
The most important Platonic work that is comparable to
Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em> is the <em>Timaeus</em>, and it
therefore comes as no surprise that Neoplatonists contrasted the two
works. The following discussion places Proclus&rsquo; judgement next
to that of Simplicius, once again pointing to the latter&rsquo;s
consistent tendency to harmonise. In his preface to his <em>Commentary
on the Timaeus</em> (<em>In Tim.</em> I 6.21&ndash;7.16, translated by
H. Tarrant),
Proclus observes that Aristotle tried to emulate his teacher Plato,
but did not succeed: his approach to natural science was frequently
too detailed and &ldquo;extended [&hellip;] beyond what was called
for&rdquo;. Instead of concentrating on the causes proper, Aristotle
mainly investigated the auxiliary causes, while in biology
(&ldquo;study of animals&rdquo;) he focused on matter as a cause,
neglecting its formal aspects. Proclus concludes that &ldquo;by
pinning his explanations of physical things on this, [Aristotle]
demonstrates to us just how far he falls short of the teaching of his
master&rdquo;. This is very different from Simplicius, who provides
several examples of how Aristotle surpassed his teacher:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Aristotle also surpassed/differed from (<em>di&ecirc;ngke</em>) both
Plato and all those before Plato alike: while they discussed natural
subjects either as if discussing all of the things that are (as some
of those before Plato did), or they raised the questions that are
treated here as if they were questions about the cosmos and its parts
and did so in writings on the cosmos (as Plato himself and some of
those before him did), Aristotle both distinguished what rank natural
things have among the things that are and also teaches, as if there
were no cosmos, about natural body in its own right. Also, among the
elements he demonstrated that privation is something other than
matter, whereas Plato failed to distinguish privation from matter. And
while the others omit the efficient cause, and Anaxagoras and Plato
(which is the same as to say the Pythagoreans) posited the divine
intellect &lt;as efficient cause&gt;, Aristotle, seeking the proximate
efficient cause of the things that arise by nature, says that it is
nature, which Plato had set down among the instrumental causes as
being moved by another and moving others. Not, however, that Aristotle
stopped at the level of nature either, as if it were the first
efficient cause, or the principally [<em>kuri&ocirc;s</em>] efficient
cause, but he himself went up to the unmoved cause that moves all
things, and at the end of this treatise he made all moving things
depend on this. Also the form of this man's natural science
surpassed/differed from (<em>di&ecirc;ngke</em>) the ancients
(<em>palaioter&ocirc;n</em>), inasmuch as he turned their riddling
manner (<em>ainigmat&ocirc;des</em>) into something clearer, and added
precision to the demonstrations; he surpassed/differed from
(<em>di&ecirc;ngke</em>) Plato, inasmuch as he makes the necessities
in the demonstrations more manifest, and takes care to draw their
principles from sensation and from opinions ready to hand; and he
surpassed/differed from (<em>di&ecirc;ngke</em>) all of them alike in
working out all the parts of natural science, down to the most
particular. (Simplicius, <em>In Phys.</em> 7.27&ndash;8.15, translated
by S. Menn and R. Barney, slightly modified)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
With Proclus&rsquo; critical reserve in mind, this long eulogy (the
longest continuous praise of Aristotle in Simplicius&rsquo; extant
works) is even more remarkable. According to Simplicius, Aristotle was
the first to establish an autonomous science of nature
(<em>phusiologia</em>), while the Presocratics subsumed natural
philosophy under ontology and Plato subsumed it under cosmology (in
the <em>Timaeus</em>). Further, Aristotle introduced distinctions that
were not present in his predecessors, such as the one between matter
and privation. While Plato considered nature merely an instrumental
cause, Aristotle considers it the proximate efficient cause
(<em>proseches poi&ecirc;tikon aition</em>), and, in the tradition of
Ammonius, he considers the Unmoved Mover to be the highest <em>causa
efficiens</em>. Simplicius mentions Aristotle&rsquo;s merits in logic,
but also his way of presenting philosophical arguments, insofar as he
was the first to use plain words, in contrast to the Presocratics and
earlier theological traditions, who spoke in riddles. Plato may also
be said to use riddles/speak in a riddling manner at times, for
instance in his <em>Timaeus</em>, which is explicitly called a likely
story (<em>eik&ocirc;s muthos</em>). Finally, while Proclus accused
Aristotle of being too fond of details, Simplicius admires his
&ldquo;working out all the parts of natural science, down to the most
particular&rdquo;.</p>

<h4 id="DigrPareRunnComm">2.3 Digressions (<em>parekbaseis</em>, from the running commentary)</h4>

<p>
One characteristic feature of the long <em>Commentary on the
Physics</em> is the so-called digressions (<em>parekbaseis</em>),
which are autonomous little treatises on their own that range between
one and one-half and 45 pages long and usually discuss a specific
topic (such as the Presocratic Parmenides, matter, nature, chance,
place, time, void, and self-movement) from a strictly Neoplatonic
perspective. Golitsis (2008a: 86) counts 12 digressions in the
commentary, plus four from book VIII, that are refutations of
arguments presented in Philoponus&rsquo; last work, <em>Against
Aristotle</em> (<em>Contra Aristotelem</em>). These digressions
certainly give Simplicius more freedom in organising his material and
also make him more prone to criticise Aristotle, which is particularly
true of the digressions or corollaries on place and time. In the rest
of the commentary, Simplicius follows Aristotle&rsquo;s text and tries
to make sense of it.</p>

<p>
In order to understand the nature and aim of a typical digression, it
is useful to examine the beginning of the so-called <em>Corollary on
Place</em> (<em>In Phys.</em> 601.1&ndash;645.19), by far the longest
of the digressions and a kind of monograph on the topic. After
commenting on <em>Physics</em> IV 1&ndash;5 (Aristotle&rsquo;s account
of place), Simplicius introduces what can be considered a genuinely
Neoplatonic investigation into the nature of place
(<em>topos</em>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Such is the character of Aristotle&rsquo;s account of place. It
contains many difficulties and offered many lines of examination to
those who came after him. So I wish to set out the objections brought
against him and to bring to light the cause of his faulty argument
(<em>paralogismos</em>) about place. But even then my account does not
seem to be complete. For there have been other opinions about place
since Aristotle, an examination of which he would have handed down to
us if they had arisen before him. So he would approve of them also
being examined. Also the theory stating that place is an interval,
briefly tested by him but approved by the most distinguished of his
successors, seems to me to be worthy of more extended consideration.
If I were able myself to contribute to the articulation of our
thoughts about place I think that Aristotle would countenance my
daring, since he has provided the basis himself. So if I shall seem to
exceed the office of a commentator, let those who notice it blame the
difficulty and complexity of the problem. (Simplicius, <em>In
Phys.</em> 601.1&ndash;13, translated by J. O. Urmson)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The text brings out rather well the characteristic feature of a
digression as part of a commentary. From the outset, Simplicius
emphasises that he is going to criticise Aristotle for his faulty
argument (<em>paralogismos</em>) about the nature of place. Aristotle
had suggested four candidates for identifying place (matter, form,
interval, surrounding container) and ultimately, by a method of
exclusion, defined place as the &ldquo;immediate, immobile limit of
the surrounding container&rdquo; (<em>Physics</em> IV 5,
212a20&ndash;21). Simplicius sets out to argue why such a definition
cannot succeed and in turn discusses place from a Neoplatonic
perspective, with particular attention paid to the intelligible causes
of place. He also reviews several opinions on place that had been
suggested in the wake of Aristotle&rsquo;s treatment, especially the
view that determines place as an interval, and he makes it clear that
such a procedure &ldquo;exceeds the office of a
commentator&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
A similar argument can be found in the introduction to
Simplicius&rsquo; digression on time (<em>Corollary on Time</em>,
<em>In Phys.</em> 773.8&ndash;800.25). Simplicius stresses that, after
a &ldquo;clarification (<em>saph&ecirc;neia</em>) of Aristotle&rsquo;s
discussion of time&rdquo; (i.e., his commentary on <em>Physics</em> IV
10&ndash;14), it is time to investigate what time is&mdash;for his
academic training (<em>philomath&ecirc;s gumnasia</em>), he remarks,
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
has not the sole aim of learning Aristotle&rsquo;s opinion concerning
the nature of time, but rather of understanding what time is&mdash;by
which I think that we shall also get a closer grasp of
Aristotle&rsquo;s thoughts on time. (<em>In Phys.</em>
773.10&ndash;14, translated by J. O. Urmson) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As in the <em>Corollary on Place</em>, Simplicius does this by first
reviewing other philosophical opinions on time.</p>

<p>
The digressions are a characteristic Neoplatonic element in
Simplicius&rsquo; <em>Commentary on the Physics</em>. Interestingly,
we also find them in Philoponus&rsquo; commentary on the same work
(Golitsis 2008a: 174&ndash;195). Simplicius is careful to mark off his
digressions from the rest of the running commentary, and it would
probably be much more difficult to reconstruct the Neoplatonic
character of Simplicius&rsquo; philosophy based only on his exegesis
of Aristotle, as running commentary and digressions follow rather
different rules and methods. The commentary serves to clarify what
Aristotle has written, while the digressions, particularly those with
a monographic character (on place and time), discuss philosophical
problems as such.</p>

<h4 id="CritPres">2.4 Criticism of the Presocratics</h4>

<p>
Simplicius approaches Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Physics</em> with a
strictly Neoplatonic agenda. His permanent interlocutors are
Plato&rsquo;s <em>Timaeus</em>, the Presocratics, and Peripatetic and
Neoplatonic commentators (especially Alexander of Aphrodisias), and
where possible, he aims at harmonising Plato and Aristotle. The
following provides an example of how he managed to integrate
Presocratic philosophy into the Platonic tradition. To Simplicius, the
Presocratics frequently speak in riddles
(<em>ainigmat&ocirc;d&ocirc;s</em>), and both Plato and Aristotle
manage to clarify their thoughts (<em>In Phys.</em> 37.3&ndash;4).
However, both also frequently criticise the Presocratics, which might
seem to raise a serious threat for Simplicius&rsquo; harmonising
strategy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But we were compelled to draw this out at greater length on account of
the people who are easily inclined to accuse the ancients of
disagreement [e.g., the Christians]. But since we will hear Aristotle
too refuting the opinions of earlier philosophers, and before
Aristotle Plato seems to do this, and before both of them Parmenides
and Xenophanes, it should be known that these people, being concerned
for those who listen more superficially, refuted the apparent
absurdity (<em>to phainomenon atopon</em>) in their accounts, since
the ancients were accustomed to express their doctrines in riddles
(<em>ainigmat&ocirc;d&ocirc;s</em>). (Simplicius, <em>In Phys.</em>
36.24&ndash;31, translated by R. Barney and S. Menn)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Not only do Plato and Aristotle criticise the Presocratics; the
Presocratics also criticised each other. In the case of Parmenides of
Elea and his poem, Simplicius suggests an interesting strategy to
neutralise both Plato&rsquo;s and Aristotle&rsquo;s arguments, a
strategy first suggested by Plutarch of Chaeronea to relate the two
parts of the poem to the intelligible and sensible realms. Like
Plutarch, Simplicius identifies Parmenides&rsquo; One with the
intelligible realm. This allows him to argue that Aristotle&rsquo;s
alleged criticisms aim first at showing that Parmenides&rsquo;
One-Being ought not to be located within the physical realm. In other
words, the difficulties Aristotle raises are constructive, in the eyes
of Simplicius, to the extent that they point to the impossibility of a
corporeal One. On the other hand, according to Simplicius, Plato shows
that Parmenides&rsquo; One is not beyond being and, like Aristotle,
places it on the intelligible level.</p>

<h4 id="RoleNatuPhus">2.5 The role of nature (<em>phusis</em>)</h4>

<p>
In the preface to the commentary, Simplicius already points to a
difference between Plato and Aristotle on the role of nature in
natural philosophy (<em>In Phys.</em> 8.1&ndash;6): While Plato
considered it an instrumental cause (<em>organikon</em>), Aristotle
made it the &ldquo;proximate efficient cause (<em>proseches
poi&ecirc;tikon aition</em>) of the things that arise by
nature&rdquo;. At first sight, this looks like a small, insignificant
difference. However, what is at stake becomes clear in a passage in
the commentary where Simplicius comments on Alexander&rsquo;s
conception of physical causality. For a Neoplatonist, the realm of
nature was created by the world&ndash;soul, which in turn made use of
the Platonic Forms. This is why Simplicius emphasises that when Plato
engages in natural philosophy, he links natural processes to the
transcendent Forms&mdash;that is, natural processes are, to a
considerable degree, controlled by intelligible causes. 

<blockquote>

<p>
[Aristotle] always refuses to deviate from nature; on the contrary, he considers even things which are above nature according to their relation to nature, just as, by contrast, the divine Plato, according to Pythagorean usage, examines even natural things insofar as they
participate in the things above nature. (Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em>
6.26&ndash;30, translated by M. Chase)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Even if nature, which is a lower, non-rational agent in Neoplatonism, is not
able to revert upon itself or know itself, its actions are guided by
and in accordance with immanent rational principles called
<em>logoi</em> (which are images of the transcendent Forms). For
Alexander, on the other hand, nature is not a rational agent (in the
sense of the word discussed here); rather, it is
<em>alogos</em>&mdash; it does not act rationally&mdash;even if it is
part of a teleological system and even if, according to Aristotle, it
does nothing in vain (<em>De cael.</em> I 4, 271a33: &ldquo;The god
and nature do nothing in vain&rdquo;.). Simplicius agrees with
Alexander that nature does not cognise or think, but nevertheless
holds that it acts rationally and possesses <em>logos</em>. He finds
support for the latter in Aristotle himself (<em>De gen. et corr</em>.
II 6, 333b11; see <em>In Phys.</em> 313.38&ndash;314.1). To this end,
he distinguishes two kinds of <em>logos</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Why, then, does he [sc. Alexander] say that nature is a non-rational
power (<em>alogos dunamis</em>) although it acts for the sake of some
end, proceeds in an ordered way according to stages and determined
measures? The answer is that the productive rational principle
(<em>poi&ecirc;tikos logos</em>) is twofold, one producing in a
cognitive manner (<em>gn&ocirc;stik&ocirc;s</em>), which the
interpreter sees as reason alone, the other without cognition
(<em>gn&ocirc;sis</em>) and self-reversion
(<em>epistroph&ecirc;</em>), but still producing in an ordered and
determined manner for the sake of some prior end. Just as the
noncognisant is non-rational as compared to cognitive reason, so that
which produces in a random and disorderly manner is non-rational as
compared to that which produces in an ordered and determined manner
for the sake of something. Therefore, just as what comes-to-be by
nature does so according to a rational principle of this nature, so it
does so according to a model which is not established as something
known by the producer, but because the producer makes the product like
itself by being, not by choosing, just as the signet-ring makes the
impression. (Simplicius, <em>In Phys.</em> 313.29&ndash;38, translated
by B. Fleet, slightly modified)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="RoleMatt">2.6 The role of matter</h4>

<p>
Aristotle was the first to use the Greek word for matter
(<em>hul&ecirc;</em>). He calls matter the material substrate
(<em>hupokeimenon</em>). According to him, sensible particulars
consist of matter and form (hylomorphism). However, Plato had already
developed an interesting theory of matter&ndash;space in the
<em>Timaeus</em> by introducing a third kind, i.e.,
<em>ch&ocirc;ra</em>, which in itself is without qualities, but able
to become whatever enters into it (fire, water, etc.). What is more,
Plato developed a kind of geometrical atomism, arguing that the
elemental properties of things are (five) simple geometrical bodies.
Aristotle criticises the latter theory in great detail in his <em>De
caelo</em>. Interestingly, Simplicius argues, in what may be called a
&ldquo;digression on matter&rdquo; (<em>In Phys.</em>
227.23&ndash;233.3), that the two conceptions of matter are
compatible. The basic idea of his harmonisation lies in Plato&rsquo;s
and Aristotle&rsquo;s allegedly sharing a theory of prime matter as
unqualified (<em>apoios</em>) body (<em>s&ocirc;ma</em>) (Sorabji
1987b)&mdash;however, not body in the Stoic sense of the word, but
rather body conceived as &ldquo;extension and indefinite
quantity&rdquo; (232.25) and a &ldquo;condition of existing&rdquo;
(<em>katast&ecirc;ma</em>) for perceptible things (232.2). Simplicius
arrives at this conclusion by distinguishing between two kinds of body
(<em>s&ocirc;ma</em>), namely, body as ordinarily defined (as shared
by the Stoics) and a much more basic kind, while the elementary bodies
of Plato&rsquo;s <em>Timaeus</em> are not yet matter, but the
principles of matter.</p>

<h4 id="ArisCritPlatTheoForm">2.7 Aristotle&rsquo;s criticism of Plato&rsquo;s Theory of Forms</h4>

<p>
One of the most explicit criticisms of Plato&rsquo;s theory of Forms
in the <em>Physics</em> can be found in chapter II 2. The passage is
situated in a context where Aristotle distinguishes the natural
scientist from the mathematician (against the background of his
<em>Metaphysics</em> E 1), arguing that while the former studies
formal features of a body <em>qua</em> physical entity, the latter
mentally separates these features and considers them in themselves.
According to Aristotle, those who champion the Forms do the same thing
in positing transcendent Forms. They separate formal features from a
subject and hypostasise them, although they are &ldquo;less
separable than mathematical entities&rdquo; (<em>Phys.</em> II 2,
193b36&ndash;194a1, trans. by author). Simplicius takes this criticism as his point of
departure for a longer comment on Plato&rsquo;s theory of Forms.
According to Simplicius, Aristotle does not criticise Plato, but
rather a misleading, vulgar interpretation of Plato&rsquo;s
theory:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
This was how Aristotle so convincingly countered the popular views
(<em>d&ecirc;m&ocirc;deis ennoiai</em>) about the forms, which are not
conscious of the other world, but without even stripping enmattered
forms completely of their matter imagine that they pre-exist in the
mind of the craftsman (<em>d&ecirc;miourgikos nous</em>); all entities
in this world, both those with matter and those which share in the
manner of the substantial being of things &ldquo;down here&rdquo;, are
considered simply, and they think that these are forms; yet they
consider the similarity of things &ldquo;down here&rdquo; to things
&ldquo;up there&rdquo; not as that of image to model, but as absolute
identity. (Simplicius, <em>In Phys.</em> 295.12&ndash;18, translated
by B. Fleet, slightly modified)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="RivaTheoMove">2.8 Rival theories of movement?</h4>

<p>
A major challenge for anyone who aims to harmonise Plato and Aristotle
is their different theories of movement. While in the
<em>Phaedrus</em>, <em>Laws</em>, and elsewhere, the self-moving soul
is the principle of movement, Aristotle criticises psychic
self-movement and argues that the principle of motion ought to be in
itself unmoved or, in his paradoxical expression, an Unmoved Mover
which moves as something loved (<em>h&ocirc;s er&ocirc;menon</em>). In
Proclus&rsquo; <em>Elements of Theology</em>, we find an explicit
reconciliation of these two views. Proclus seems to argue that
although the principle of movement must be unmoved, without a
self-mover we could not imagine movement to begin in the first place
(<em>Elem. Theol.</em> &sect; 14).</p>

<p>
Standing in the tradition of Proclus, but also depending on the
latter&rsquo;s pupil Ammonius, Simplicius does not use the argument
from the beginning of all movement, but rather follows Ammonius in
arguing for the Unmoved Mover as efficient cause. The latter was still
dismissed by Proclus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
My teacher Ammonius has written an entire book that provides many
proofs of the fact that Aristotle considers god to be also the
efficient cause of the entire world, and I have here taken over some
points sufficiently for my present purposes. His more complete
instruction on this topic can be found in that book. (Simplicius,
<em>In Phys.</em> 1363.8&ndash;12, translated by R. McKirahan)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The passage indicates that Simplicius depends on Ammonius in the
present context, but he only uses &ldquo;some points sufficiently for
[his] present purposes&rdquo;. His argument reveals, once again, that
harmonisation did not aim at identical doctrines, but at a
reconciliation or rapprochement, and it should be kept in mind that
his main target was the Christian Philoponus.</p>

<p>
Accordingly, Simplicius does not argue that the Unmoved Mover and the
demiurge of the <em>Timaeus</em> are identical. Rather, he asserts
that Aristotle is right in arguing against a creation of the world in
time. In a second step, he reminds us of Aristotle&rsquo;s definition
of an efficient cause as &ldquo;the source from which motion has its
origin&rdquo; and maintains that &ldquo;it is clear that just as all
things are made good through the final cause, so they exist and live
through the creative &lt;cause&gt;&rdquo;. Interestingly, Alexander of
Aphrodisas would also grant the efficient causality of the Unmoved
Mover for the movement of the divine body. However, Simplicius goes a
step further by arguing that even its existence depends on the Unmoved
Mover:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[One] should pay attention to the fact that what is moved by something
else must also get its subsistence (<em>hupostasis</em>) from
something else, if in fact existence (<em>ousia</em>) is superior
(<em>kreitt&ocirc;n</em>) to movement. But since according to
Aristotle the power that every finite body has is finite&mdash;that is
to say, the power that causes motion and is constitutive of
existence&mdash;it is necessary, then, that just as it has its eternal
motion from the unmoved cause, so also it receives its eternal
corporeal existence (<em>ousia</em>) from the incorporeal
&lt;cause&gt;. (Simplicius, <em>In Phys.</em> 1363.2&ndash;8,
translated by R. McKirahan)</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="CommArisHeav">3. The Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>On the Heavens</em></h3>

<p>
According to Simplicius (and, as he himself emphasises, all the
commentators before him), Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>De caelo</em> should
be read after the <em>Physics</em> (<em>In Cael.</em> 3.8&ndash;12).
This makes sense, insofar as the latter work sets out to clarify the
basic notions connected with moved bodies in space and time, nature
(<em>phusis</em>), the four causes, and the origin of movement as
such. The treatise (in four books) has two main topics: in the first
two books, the origin, nature, and movement of the universe
(&ldquo;the all&rdquo;), the planets/heavenly bodies (including the
earth) and the stuff they are made from (i.e., the fifth element, or
ether [<em>aith&ecirc;r</em>]), and in the last two books, the
universe&rsquo;s material components, to wit, the four elements and
their movements.</p>

<p>
The argument of the first two books is based on a rather curious
doctrine that distinguishes Aristotle from his predecessors. In order
to explain the circular movement of the universe and its planets, he
introduces a fifth element (or &ldquo;first body&rdquo;
[<em>pr&ocirc;ton s&ocirc;ma</em>, <em>In Cael.</em> I 3, 270b21] or
&ldquo;body that moves in a circle&rdquo; [<em>kuklophorikon
s&ocirc;ma</em>, an expression not used by Aristotle, but by
Simplicius, e.g., <em>In Cael.</em> 2.7, 6.5, and passim]). This is
the only element, according to Aristotle, that is not subject to
generation and corruption and possesses a natural movement in a
circle, while the other four move either upwards or downwards.</p>

<p>
The ancient commentators had already discussed the issue of the main
topic of the work (<em>skopos</em>), and Simplicius has a great deal
to say about it. His discussion, which includes a criticism of
Alexander&rsquo;s view, covers almost the entire preface to the
commentary (<em>In Cael.</em> 1.2&ndash;5.37):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Alexander says that the subject of Aristotle&rsquo;s treatise <em>On
the Heavens</em> (<em>Peri ouranou</em>) is the world
(<em>kosmos</em>). He says that &ldquo;heaven&rdquo;
(<em>ouranos</em>) is used in three senses by Aristotle in this work,
to mean both the sphere of the fixed stars and the whole of the divine
revolving body, which in this book he also calls the &ldquo;furthest
heaven&rdquo; (with the adjective), and additionally &ldquo;the
world&rdquo;, as Plato called it when he said &ldquo;the whole heaven,
or the world or whatever else it might care to be called&rdquo;. And
he adduces Theophrastus as witness, since he talks in his <em>On the
Heavens</em> not only of the divine body but also about things which
come to be and about their principles. Thus Alexander says [the
treatise] is about the world and the five bodies in it, that of the
heaven and the four of the sublunary world, fire, air, water, earth.
(Simplicius, <em>In Cael.</em> 1.1&ndash;12, translated by R. J.
Hankinson)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is Alexander&rsquo;s position as summarised by Simplicius, who is
not at all satisfied with such a definition of the <em>skopos</em>
because it violates Iamblichus&rsquo; rule that one ought to find a
single topic to which everything else can be related.
Simplicius&rsquo; own solution is not that different from
Alexander&rsquo;s, if slightly more sophisticated. He argues that,
despite its title, <em>On the Heavens</em> primarily deals with the
elements or simple bodies (<em>hapla s&ocirc;mata</em>) and that the
heaven is identical with the most primary first body
(<em>pr&ocirc;tistos</em>, <em>In Cael.</em> 5.32&ndash;34).</p>

<p>
As with his other commentaries, Simplicius approaches <em>On the
Heavens</em> by means of a catalogue of preliminary questions (see
 <a href="index-2.html#HowCommArisNeop">&sect;4 in the main article</a>),
 which in this case is extremely selective. After the comprehensive
account of the topic of the work, he briefly refers to its title
(<em>epigraph&ecirc;</em>, which is clearly related to the topic), its
place in the order of reading (<em>taxis t&ecirc;s
anagn&ocirc;se&ocirc;s</em>), and its division into chapters or parts
(<em>dihairesis</em>). Some other preliminary points
(<em>kephalaia</em>), such as its usefulness
(<em>chr&ecirc;simon</em>), its authenticity (<em>gn&ecirc;sion</em>),
and the part of philosophy to which it belongs (<em>meros t&ecirc;s
philosophias</em>), are missing here. We may guess that its usefulness
is comparable to that of the <em>Physics</em> (see
 <a href="#CommArisPhys">&sect;2</a>),
 in which domain it clearly belongs. At the end of the commentary,
Simplicius calls his commentary a hymn to the demiurge or creator-god
of the cosmos (<em>In Cael.</em> 731.25&ndash;29). Its authenticity is
not addressed, probably because no one in Antiquity questioned it.</p>

<p>
The following subsections discuss selected topics from
Simplicius&rsquo; <em>Commentary on the De caelo</em>.</p>

<h4 id="OrigCosmNeopPers">3.1 The origin of the cosmos (from a Neoplatonic perspective)</h4>

<p>
Simplicius&rsquo; primary aim is to demonstrate that Plato&rsquo;s
<em>Timaeus</em> and Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>On the Heavens</em> are
compatible. For Aristotle, the cosmos did not have a beginning;
rather, it is ungenerated (<em>De cael.</em> A 1, 10&ndash;12:
<em>agen&ecirc;tos</em>). In contrast, the <em>Timaeus</em> explicitly
states that the cosmos came to be (<em>gegonen</em>, <em>Tim.</em>
28b), and Neoplatonists, at least from Proclus onward (<em>In
Tim.</em> I 282.27 sqq.), tried to distinguish different respects in
which a thing can be generated. The same strategy can be observed in
Simplicius:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But since this is enough of these matters, let us next see in what
sense of &ldquo;comes to be&rdquo; Aristotle denies that heaven comes
to be and tries to demonstrate that it does not come to be, and in
what sense Plato says that both heaven and the whole cosmos come to
be. (Simplicius, <em>In Cael.</em> 103.1&ndash;4, translated by I.
Mueller)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He then explains that Aristotle has only one sense of &ldquo;coming to
be&rdquo;, namely, &ldquo;the change in time from non-being into
being&rdquo; (i.e., restricted to things of the sublunary realm), and
that Plato also knows this meaning of the term (Simplicius compares
<em>Laws</em> 894a; see also <em>In Cael.</em> 300.14&ndash;301.7),
but for Plato, &ldquo;being generated&rdquo; can also signify
&ldquo;having its existence from the demiurge&rdquo; or
&ldquo;depending on the demiurge as on a cause&rdquo;. The latter is a
kind of generation above and beyond the sublunary realm:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is obvious that the theologians speak of the generation of the
world not [in the sense of its coming] from a temporal beginning, but
as [coming] from a productive cause, and they do so figuratively
(<em>muthik&ocirc;s</em>), as they do in other contexts. (Simplicius,
<em>In Cael.</em> 294.7&ndash;10, translated by I. Mueller)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Another aspect of this discussion is worth mentioning. At
<em>Tim.</em> 41b, the demiurge says to the young gods, &ldquo;you are
not altogether immortal, but you will not be dissolved&rdquo; (quoted by Simplicius at <em>In Cael.</em> 108.33&ndash;34, translated by Robert J. Hankinson). This seems to imply
that the demiurge himself could decide to let them perish again. How
does Simplicius address the passage? Once again, he translates what
the demiurge says into causal terms and asserts that the young gods,
and hence also the cosmos and the heavenly bodies, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
do not possess immortality both as a result of themselves and as a
result of the cause, as the self-subsistents do, but from the cause
alone, from which alone they are produced. (<em>In Cael.</em>
108.33&ndash;109.8; cf. <em>In Cael.</em> 369.23&ndash;32)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In a certain sense, according to Simplicius, the Platonic cosmos is
both generated and ungenerated, and being generated points to its
causal dependency on the demiurge. There is, however, a further issue
that needs to be resolved, namely, that the <em>Timaeus</em> says that
&ldquo;time came to be together with the heaven&rdquo; (<em>Tim.</em>
38b). Simplicius settles
this problem by pointing to the infinity of time:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For time has come to be together with the heaven, as Plato says; it
does not exist before or after the heaven, but its infinity makes the
temporal extension of the heaven infinite. (<em>In Cael.</em>
368.7&ndash;9, translated by I. Mueller)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="FiftElemAgaiPhil">3.2 On the fifth element, against Philoponus</h4>

<p>
As just explained, according to the Neoplatonists, Plato&rsquo;s
statement that &ldquo;time came to be together with the heaven&rdquo;
(<em>Tim.</em> 38b, trans. by author) does
not mean that the cosmos was created in time. The latter is, however,
what Christian philosophers believed as they combined the story of the
creation of the world in book <em>Genesis</em> of the Old Testament
with Plato&rsquo;s <em>Timaeus</em>. Such a combination of
Jewish/Christian and Platonic cosmogonies can be observed for the
first time in Philo of Alexandria&rsquo;s <em>On the Creation of the
World</em> (<em>De opificio mundi</em>). In a treatise that is now
lost, Proclus had already written a comprehensive defence of the
eternity of the world against Aristotle. This in turn provoked a
reaction from Philoponus, who argued against Proclus in his
<em>Against Proclus, On the Eternity of the World</em>. The latter is
the basis for a reconstruction of Proclus&rsquo; own arguments.
Philoponus also wrote a second work entitled <em>Against Aristotle, On
the Eternity of the World</em> of which only fragments have been
preserved (Wildberg 2013). Philoponus, in turn, is taken to task by
Simplicius, as discussed above, on several issues, one of them being
his Christian view on the creation of the world in time. For our
present purposes, Philoponus&rsquo; <em>Against Aristotle</em> is more
important than the <em>Contra Proclum</em>, because Simplicus
explicitly asserts that he only read the former (<em>In Cael.</em>
135.27&ndash;31).</p>

<p>
Several scholarly works have discussed Simplicius&rsquo; polemics
against Philoponus, for instance, Hoffmann (1987a) and, most notably,
Wildberg (1988 and 2013). The most significant points are as follows.
The main point of contention between Christian and pagan philosophers
was whether the world had been created in time. Simplicius argued that
Philoponus misunderstood Plato&rsquo;s account of creation in the
<em>Timaeus</em> and neglected the basic harmony between Plato and
Aristotle. The status of aether (<em>aith&ecirc;r</em>) was
fundamental for this entire discussion. In the first book of <em>De
caelo</em>, Aristotle introduced this so-called fifth or first
element, next to earth, water, air and fire in order to explain the
circular motion and incorruptibility of the heavens. Aether is a
material component of the heavenly bodies that has no origin and does
not wear away. It only explains the locomotion of the heavens
(<em>hul&ecirc; kata topon</em>). In addition, he considered the
heavenly bodies divine (<em>theia</em>).</p>

<p>
For Christian philosophers, the notion of aether was unacceptable for
at least two reasons. They had to deny the existence of an eternal
element for the same reason that they denied the eternity of the
world, to wit, because everything had, in their view, been created by
god. They also had to reject the divinity of the heavens, because
according to the Christian creed, there is only one god (monotheism).
For those thinkers who defended the harmony of Plato and Aristotle,
aether also presented a challenge, because Plato&rsquo;s
<em>Timaeus</em> described only the four basic elements. Nevertheless,
Simplicius manages to harmonise Plato and Aristotle by arguing that
there is indeed a fifth element, but it is composed of the purest
parts of the four elements, a strategy which can already be found in
Proclus (Baltzly 2002).</p>

<h3 id="CommEpicHandEnch">4. The Commentary on Epictetus&rsquo; Handbook (<em>Encheiridion</em>)</h3>

<p>
This is one of two extant late Neoplatonic texts dedicated to ethical
problems, the other being Hierocles&rsquo; commentary on the
Pythagorean <em>Carmina aurea</em> (cf. <em>In Epict.</em> P
194.48&ndash;51 [Hadot]). These texts were most likely read as
preliminaries to the actual curriculum, which contained selected
Aristotelian writings and Platonic dialogues. As noted in
 <a href="#CommArisCate">Section 7.1</a>,
 Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> was not suitable
preparation for reading the works of Aristotle and Plato because it
presupposes too much terminology and training in argumentative logic
(Simplicius, <em>In Cat.</em> 5.16&ndash;6.3). Compared to Aristotle
and his &ldquo;obscurity&rdquo; (<em>asapheia</em>), the speeches of
Epictetus are &ldquo;pithy&rdquo; (<em>kommatikoi</em>),
&ldquo;gnomic&rdquo; (<em>gn&ocirc;mologikoi</em>), and
&ldquo;clear&rdquo; (<em>sapheis</em>; Simplicius, <em>In Epict.</em>
P 194.48 &amp; 56 [Hadot]), and hence suitable for beginners.</p>

<p>
The <em>Commentary on Epictetus&rsquo; Handbook</em> shares several
features with the <em>Commentary on the De anima</em> (Hadot 1995: 61&ndash;113). Both deal primarily with the
rational human soul in its embodied state, and both emphasise that the
soul&rsquo;s essence is independent of the body. Both also share a
most interesting anthropology. In the preface to his work, Simplicius
explains for whom the work is (and is not) intended:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But first of all, as I said, we must distinguish the sort of human
being these speeches were intended for, and the sort of human life
they lead someone who is convinced by them to be virtuous in. Well,
they are not directed towards someone who is capable of living
cathartically (<em>kathartik&ocirc;s z&ecirc;n</em>): such a person
wants, in so far as possible, to flee from the body and from the
bodily emotions, and to withdraw into himself.</p>

<p>
Even less are they meant for the theoretical person
(<em>the&ocirc;r&ecirc;tikos</em>): such a person, rising above even
his rational life, wants to be wholly one of our superiors. Rather,
the speeches suit those who have their essence in accordance with a
rational life, which uses the body as an instrument, and doesn&rsquo;t
consider the body to be a part of the soul, or it to be a part of the
body, or believe that the soul along with the body completes
(<em>sumpl&ecirc;roun</em>) the human being (as though it were
constituted by two parts, the soul and the body). (Simplicius, <em>In
Epict.</em> P 194.61&ndash;195.72 [Hadot], translated by C. Brittain
and T. Brennan)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Simplicius alludes here to a famous scheme of virtues that goes back
to Plotinus (I 2 [19] <em>On virtue</em>) and Porphyry (<em>Sent</em>.
32). The latter provides the following scale of four virtues, which
formed the basis for further Neoplatonic elaborations: civic,
purgative, contemplative, and paradigmatic. These virtues represent
different stages towards unification with the first principle.
Simplicius explicitly states that his commentary serves those who aim
to acquire the ethical and political virtues (<em>In Epict.</em> P.
195.80&ndash;81) and that its purpose is to &ldquo;rectify human
life&rdquo; (<em>In Epict.</em> P. 194.52). In Simplicius&rsquo;
approach, it is crucial that human beings correctly conceive of the
relation of the soul and the body. The body and soul are not two
parts, let alone on a par, that constitute the human being; rather,
the body is only an instrument of the soul. Calling the body an
instrument is not necessarily devaluing it. As an instrument, the body
can serve the soul well and function well. But it may also lead the
soul astray, first and foremost by means of bodily emotions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But when the soul becomes more familiar with the body than it should
be, and no longer treats it as its instrument, but rather embraces it
as a part of itself, or even as though it were itself, then the soul
is made irrational by the body and shares affections with it. Then the
soul believes that the desires of spirit and appetite are proper to
it, and by being subservient to them, and finding means for getting
what they desire, it becomes bad in all these respects. (Simplicius,
<em>In Epict.</em> XIV 262.137&ndash;142 [Hadot], translated by C.
Brittain and T. Brennan)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
As we have seen, the entire commentary has an ethical purpose.
Simplicius argues that the underlying anthropology&mdash;or rather,
psychology&mdash;can be extracted from Plato&rsquo;s <em>Alcibiades
I</em> and <em>Timaeus</em>. Plato provides the metaphysical
background, as it were, for Epictetus&rsquo; ethical theories. Two
claims are crucial for this. First, the rational soul is the real self
of a human being, and second, the demiurge created the soul as a free
entity (free from the body), and the soul is determined to eventually
regain this primordial freedom:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
But that someone who has his essence in accordance with a rational
soul is the real and true human being (<em>al&ecirc;thinos
anthr&ocirc;pos</em>), was demonstrated primarily by Plato&mdash;or
rather the Platonic Socrates&mdash;in his dialogue with Alcibiades the
fair [&hellip;]. (Simplicius, <em>In Epict.</em> P 195.82&ndash;196.85
[Hadot], translated by C. Brittain and T. Brennan)</p>

<p>
The aim of the book (<em>skopos</em>)&mdash;if it meets with people
who are persuaded by it, and do not merely read it but are actually
affected by the speeches and bring them into effect
(<em>ergasia</em>)&mdash;is to make our soul free
(<em>eleutheran</em>), as the Demiurge and Father, its maker and
generator, intended it to be: not fearing anything, or distressed at
anything, or mastered by anything inferior to it. (Simplicius, <em>In
Epict.</em> P 12&ndash;17 [Hadot], translated by C. Brittain and T.
Brennan)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The human soul&rsquo;s freedom manifests itself in its capacity to
choose freely between alternatives (<em>prohairesis</em>). It
possesses its &ldquo;value in accordance with its free choice
(<em>prohairesis</em>)&rdquo; (<em>In Epict.</em> XIV 131). A possible
danger is the so-called weakness of the will. Simplicius illustrates
this with a well-known quote from Euripides, <em>Medea</em>
1078&ndash;9 (<em>In Epict.</em> XII 59&ndash;60):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I understand how bad what I am about to do is,
<br/>
but my spirit (<em>thumos</em>) is stronger than my deliberations
(<em>bouleumata</em>).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like Simplicius&rsquo; other works, the relatively short introduction
to the <em>Commentary on Epictetus&rsquo; Handbook</em> follows the
isagogical scheme mentioned in the
 <a href="index-2.html#HowCommArisNeop">main article, Section 4</a>
 (see also I. Hadot 2003, 1&ndash;5). He discusses (1) the author of
the work, (2) its aim (<em>skopos</em>), (3) its title, (4) its
usefulness, (5) the character of the work, (6) its place in the order
of reading in the philosophical curriculum, and finally, (7) the
premise from Plato&rsquo;s <em>Alcibiades</em> I that the rational
soul is our true self.</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that Simplicius does not explicitly say that
Epictetus was a Stoic. Instead, the section on the author merely
provides some information about how Arrian, who was the pupil,
biographer, and literary executor of Epictetus, compiled the
<em>Handbook</em> as a selection from his <em>Discourses</em>
(<em>diatribai</em>), a series of informal lectures which had been
written down by the same Arrian:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In this letter to Messalenus [&hellip;], he described it [sc. the
<em>Handbook</em>] as a selection from Epictetus&rsquo; speeches
(<em>logoi</em>) containing those which are &ldquo;most timely and
most essential to philosophy, and which most stir the soul&rdquo;.
Practically all the material can be found in the same words at various
points in Arrian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Discourses (<em>diatribai</em>) of
Epictetus&rdquo;. (Simplicius, <em>In Epict.</em> P 192.4&ndash;11
[Hadot], translated by C. Brittain and T. Brennan)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Returning to the isagogical scheme, Simplicus says that
Epictetus&rsquo; work is a handbook because &ldquo;it ought always to
be to hand or ready for those who want to live well&rdquo;
(Simplicius, <em>In Epict.</em> P 193.18&ndash;20 [Hadot]). It is
directed at beginners who want to make some progress in philosophy
before turning to Aristotle and Plato, by acquiring the ethical and
political virtues.</p>

<p>
The commentary as a whole follows a clear structure and falls into
four parts after a short introduction (see Brennan &amp; Brittain
2002: 6). Chapters 1&ndash;21 address &ldquo;What is up to us and not,
and how to deal with external things&rdquo;, chapters 22&ndash;28 are
&ldquo;Advice for intermediate students (in respect to their progress
in philosophy)&rdquo;, and chapters 30&ndash;47 give &ldquo;technical
advice for the discovery of &lsquo;appropriate actions&rsquo;
(<em>kath&ecirc;konta</em>) and various precepts on justice&rdquo;.
Finally, chapters 48&ndash;53 present a &ldquo;conclusion on the
practice of precepts&rdquo;. In sum,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[t]he commentary by Simiplicius is not only an exegesis of the
<em>Handbook</em> of Epictetus. It also contains four long theological
and philosophical digressions (P. Hadot 1987: 337)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The exegesis of the text is supplemented by essays or digressions that
cover roughly one-third of the commentary and are characteristically
Neoplatonic: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he <em>arguments</em> for all the substantive metaphysical and
meta-ethical theses in the commentary are Platonist arguments, not
only where Simplicius and Epictetus disagree (e.g., on determinism and
in their theologies), but also where they agree (e.g., on the nature
of the bad and on providence). (Brennan &amp; Brittain 2002: 9)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This kind of thematic excursion from the main commentary is
exemplified in other Simplician commentaries (esp. his <em>Commentary
on the Physics</em>; see
 <a href="#DigrPareRunnComm">&sect;2.3</a>).
 Altogether, there are seven digressions, on &ldquo;the soul, against
various determinists&rdquo; (ch. 1), &ldquo;that god is not the cause
of evil things/the bad&rdquo; (ch. 8), &ldquo;the role of the
philosophers in city-states&rdquo; (ch. 24), &ldquo;the derivative
nature of the bad&rdquo; (ch. 27), &ldquo;the relations that reveal
&lsquo;appropriate actions&rsquo; (<em>kath&ecirc;konta</em>)&rdquo;
(ch. 30), &ldquo;friendship&rdquo; (ch. 30), and
&ldquo;providence&rdquo; (ch. 31). Simplicius himself acknowledges
that what he does in the commentary is much more then simply
clarifying Epictetus&rsquo; <em>Handbook</em>:</p>

<p>
But this should suffice concerning the first of the three
theses&mdash;i.e., to show that the first origins of existent things,
and God, the cause of all things, exist&mdash;even if some further
steps on the path upwards to its most perfect completion have been
left out. For I know that some of what I have said will seem
unnecessary to some people, given that the primary aim of this work is
to clarify Epictetus&rsquo; <em>Handbook</em>. (Simplicius, <em>In
Epict.</em> XXXVIII 378.437&ndash;379.442 [Hadot], translated by C.
Brittain and T. Brennan)</p>

<p>
Scholars working on Simplicius&rsquo; <em>Commentary on
Epictetus&rsquo; Handbook</em> have been puzzled by two problems,
which, on closer inspection, may well be interrelated: Why is
Simplicius commenting on a Stoic author, and why does the commentary
address so many issues that are not mentioned explicitly in the text
of Epictetus&rsquo; <em>Handbook</em>? Simplicius, it seems, considers
the <em>Handbook</em> a useful text for introducing students to the
right ethical attitude towards oneself, one&rsquo;s soul, and how to
perfect oneself. However, he wonders how Epictetus can maintain an
ethics of this kind without maintaining, for instance, the immortality
of the soul. On what, Simplicius asks, is his ethics based, if it is
not supplemented by an appropriate theology? The answer is that
Epictetus does <em>not</em> provide the principles for his ethics,
which therefore have to remain <em>hypothetical</em>. It is an ethics,
as it were, without an afterlife:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One feature of these speeches that may be surprising is that they
render the people who believe them and put them into practice blessed
and happy without the need to be promised the rewards of virtue after
death&mdash;even if these rewards always do follow too. (Simplicius,
<em>In Epict.</em> P 194.35&ndash;38 [Hadot], translated by C.
Brittain and T. Brennan)</p>

<p>
But that someone who has his essence in accordance with a rational
soul is the real and true human being, was demonstrated primarily by
Plato&mdash;or rather the Platonic Socrates&mdash;in his dialogue with
Alcibiades the fair, the son of Kleinias. Epictetus&rsquo; argument,
however, takes this as a hypothesis (<em>hupothesis</em>), and teaches
people who believe it the sort of life and deeds by which it is
possible to perfect oneself as a human being of this kind.
(Simplicius, <em>In Epict.</em> P 195.82&ndash;196.87 [Hadot],
translated by C. Brittain and T. Brennan)</p>

<p>
For by putting before our eyes activities that are fitting and proper
to just such a human being, Epictetus encourages and incites people
convinced by him to recognise these activities accurately and to put
them into practice, in order that, as I said, we may perfect our
proper essence through them. But, as I said, he does not demonstrate,
but only takes it as a hypothesis, that this is the real human being.
(Simplicius, <em>In Epict.</em> P 196.94&ndash;100 [Hadot], translated
by C. Brittain and T. Brennan)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
All this seems to explain the surprising and distinctly unstoic amount
of theology and metaphysics in the commentary (including the final
prayer at <em>In Epict.</em> E. 454.6&ndash;15). As already noted, the
human soul is initially free, and its freedom is the ability to choose
(<em>prohairesis</em>) between good and bad. But in order to choose
correctly, it is necessary to establish a principle or cause of all
good things, to wit the One or the First Good. This is, in turn, the
measure of all things, and theology becomes the (necessary) basis of
ethics:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
More generally, when one compares the position of a Stoic like
Epictetus on the relationship between philosophy and religion with
that of a Neoplatonist, viz. Simplicius, one cannot help noticing that
in the Neoplatonist there seems to be a loss of autonomy in the face
of the divine. (I. Hadot and P. Hadot 2004: 209)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In contrast to Epictetus&rsquo; <em>Handbook</em>, Simplicius
introduces several digressions on theological issues in his
commentary. For example, the following text provides an etymology and
definition of the Greek word for god (<em>theos</em>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The first step in our investigation is to see what the name
&ldquo;God&rdquo; signifies. You should know that those who first
established it gave that name to the bodies that revolve in the
heavens, taking it from &ldquo;to go&rdquo;, that is, to run and move
swiftly (cf. Plato, <em>Cratylus</em> 397c-d). But as time passed,
they transferred the name to the incorporeal and intelligible causes
of beings, and then to the one Origin and Cause of all things. So the
name signifies the origin of being, and the first and principal
intelligible cause. (Simplicius, <em>In Epict.</em> XXXVIII
368.193&ndash;369.199 [Hadot], translated by C. Brittain and T.
Brennan)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
God is the first principle and the cause of all things, &ldquo;the
goal of all things, and everything is for its sake&rdquo; (<em>In
Epict.</em> XXXVIII 391.730&ndash;731 [Hadot]), the first good, source
of all good things, henad of henads, god of gods, i.e., the
Neoplatonic One (<em>to hen</em>). Simplicius most likely takes over
the doctrine of the divine henads or gods from Proclus. He hardly
mentions them elsewhere, but see Simplicius, <em>In Cael.</em>
93.11&ndash;95.23. They are a group of divine entities coming
immediately after the One (Proclus, <em>Elements of Theology</em>
&sect;&sect; 113&ndash;165) and may represent a Neoplatonic attempt to
integrate the gods of Greek mythology into the metaphysical hierarchy
of beings.</p>

<p>
The largest part of the theology discussed in the commentary is
structured by three theses about the gods: (1) the gods exist, (2)
they exercise providence/care for the world, and (3) they direct
everything well and justly (<em>In Epict.</em> XXXVIII
367.166&ndash;171 [Hadot]). Simplicius sets out to prove these three
theses. Hence, he includes a fairly long proof of the existence of
God/the gods in his commentary, in the tradition of Plato,
<em>Laws</em> X (<em>In Epict.</em> XXXVIII 369.199&ndash;378.436
[Hadot]). It is an argument against the atheists from the existence of
movement. Compared to <em>Laws</em> X, however, it betrays a
distinctly Neoplatonic twist when Simplicius argues that a self-moving
cause presupposes an unmoved cause (cf. Proclus, <em>Elements of
Theology</em> &sect; 20).</p>

<p>
As might be expected, Simplicius also addresses the problem of the
nature and origin of evil at great length: How can we explain the
existence of evil if the first principle of all things is good? Plato
already discussed this problem of the theodicy. In the wake of what
Proclus has to say about this problem in his <em>On the Existence of
Evils</em> (Opsomer &amp; Steel 2003), Simplicius argues that evil is
not a substance (<em>hupostasis</em>) and only has a parasitical
existence or derivative subsistence (<em>parhupostasis</em>, <em>In
Epict.</em> XXXV 342.498 [Hadot]); it exists in a certain sense and
also does not exist (<em>esti p&ocirc;s kai ouk esti</em>). For
Simplicius, evil has no real place in the world (<em>In Epict.</em>
XXXV 322&ndash;344 [Hadot]), and God is not the cause of evil
(<em>theos anaitios</em>, <em>In Epict.</em> XXXV 339.414 [Hadot]; the
latter is a reference to Plato, <em>Republic</em> 615e). The fact that
human beings have free choice (<em>prohairesis</em>) and can therefore
also become vicious is not something for which God is to be
blamed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Hence God is not the cause of any kind of vice. God made the soul
capable by nature of becoming vicious, because he produced not only
the first things, but also the middle and the lowest things, so that
the universe would be completed to perfection, and the first things
would remain genuinely first and not become the lowest and
unproductive, impotent and material. So this is the reason that God,
who is good, also made a soul capable by nature of becoming vicious,
through the wealth of his own goodness. But he did not allow it to
become vicious unless the soul itself wishes it. (Simplicius, <em>In
Epict.</em>, I 212.342&ndash;349 [Hadot], translated by C. Brittain
and T. Brennan)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Many elements in Simplicius&rsquo; account of evil are taken from the
tradition before him, especially Proclus. However, a section in which
the dualistic worldview of the Manichees is criticised in much detail
has some originality (<em>In Epict.</em> XXXV 322&ndash;344 [Hadot];
see Hadot 1969).</p>

<p>
Next to theology, a substantial part of the commentary is dedicated to
&ldquo;appropriate actions&rdquo; (<em>kath&ecirc;konta</em>) and how
to derive them. This seems to be the only Neoplatonic text that deals
with this core notion of Stoic ethics at great length. However,
Simplicius does not address the problem of the exact relation of Stoic
&ldquo;appropriate actions&rdquo; to a virtue ethics of the Platonic
type. In his commentary, he distinguishes between four classes of
appropriate actions: those relating to human beings, those relating to
what is superior to oneself, those relating to what is inferior to
oneself, and those which are in relation to ourselves:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Appropriate actions are those which come about in accordance with what
pertains to us, is incumbent on us, and fits the value of each
individual; and these are the works of justice&mdash;i.e., the kind of
justice which includes the whole of virtue. For one kind of justice is
defined in contradistinction to the other virtues, while the other
kind of justice &ldquo;incorporates them all into
itself&rdquo;&mdash;since justice is rendering to each thing what
accords with its value. Hence proper education, both in ethics and
politics, turns on appropriate actions&mdash;since the first is the
justice in the soul which determines what is appropriate for each part
of the soul, and the other is the justice of the city which gives to
each part of the city what corresponds to its value. (Simplicius,
<em>In Epict.</em>, XXXVII 345.1&ndash;346.10 [Hadot], translated by
C. Brittain and T. Brennan)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There is some discussion in the secondary literature about
Simplicius&rsquo; knowledge of Stoicism and whether he does justice to
his source, Epictetus, and his doctrines. Such an approach seems to
risk missing Simplicius&rsquo; primary aim in dealing with the
<em>Encheiridion</em>. Simplicius considers it to be an appropriate
and concise introduction to basic doctrines of Platonism and, as
already noted, feels free to supplement what Epictetus says by means
of essentially Platonic digressions or essays. Recall, for instance,
that he does not even say that Epictetus or the manual itself has a
Stoic provenance. Moreover, throughout the commentary he is prepared
to criticise Stoic doctrines and contrast them with Plato&rsquo;s
views.</p>

<p>
Simplicius has not written a commentary in the strict sense, nor does
he try to do justice to the text in the modern sense of a study or
monograph. He simply uses Epictetus as a welcome and appropriate
vehicle to compose a Neoplatonic <em>Protreptikos</em> in the formal
guise of a commentary. This becomes even more obvious if we compare
Simplicius&rsquo; <em>Commentary on Epictetus&rsquo; Handbook</em>
with his commentaries on Aristotle. For instance, Simplicius does not
explain Epictetus by means of Epictetus or other Stoic authorities. He
does not praise Epictetus&rsquo; philosophical achievements, nor does
he say anything about the school he belongs to. That is, he is not
interested in the primary achievements of the Stoic school in general.
Where they agree with Platonism, fine, and where they don&rsquo;t,
Simplicius emphasises the disagreement.</p>

<h3 id="PseuSimpCommArisSoul">5. (Pseudo-?)Simplicius, Commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>On the Soul</em></h3>

<p>
Late Antiquity produced a &ldquo;great richness of psychological
doctrines&rdquo; (Steel 2013: viii) that were mostly developed to
confront Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>On the Soul</em> with Platonist
psychology. In the wake of Plotinus&rsquo; <em>Ennead</em> IV, devoted
in its entirety to psychology, and his pupil Porphyry,
(Pseudo-?)Simplicius&rsquo; main source, Iamblichus must have written
extensively on the soul (Finamore &amp; Dillon 2002), including a
commentary on the <em>De anima</em>. In addition, we know of a
commentary by Plutarch of Athens, fragments of which can be found in
(Pseudo-?)Simplicius and (Pseudo-)Philoponus (Taormina 1989). The
latter wrote a commentary on the third book of Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>De anima</em> that some attribute to Stephanus and others to
Philoponus himself. According to the manuscripts, the first two books
of this commentary are lectures by Ammonius which were slightly
revised and published by Philoponus. In addition, there is a Latin
version of a Greek original of a commentary on the third book,
commonly referred to as <em>De intellectu</em> (&ldquo;On
Intellect&rdquo;). This interesting work represents the third part of
Ammonius&rsquo; (oral) commentary on the <em>De anima</em>, edited by
Philoponus (see Golitsis 2016 on problems of attribution). We can add
to this an extant paraphrase by Themistius; additionally, Alexander of
Aphrodisias, who is mentioned several times by (Pseudo-?)Simplicius,
must have written a lost commentary on the work, in addition to his
<em>De anima</em> and <em>De intellectu</em>.</p>

<p>
All of this serves to show that Aristotle&rsquo;s text held great
interest for both the Peripatetics and the Neoplatonists. However, it
is important to emphasise that (Pseudo-?)Simplicius&rsquo; commentary
and the single books preserved by Ammonius and Philoponus are the only
extant commentaries on the <em>De anima</em> from late Antiquity.
(Pseudo-?)Simplicius&rsquo; commentary is therefore highly
significant, not only as a source for the psychology of other authors
such as Alexander, Iamblichus, and Plutarch of Athens, but also as an
important document which provides a rather original reading of
Aristotle.</p>

<p>
Apart from Plato&rsquo;s theory of Forms (ontology), it was primarily
in psychology where the Platonists and Peripatetics disagreed and
where Aristotle seemed to hold rather different views from his teacher
Plato. Well-known examples of this divergence include Plato&rsquo;s
theory of innate knowledge (learning as recollection
[<em>anamn&ecirc;sis</em>]) versus Aristotle&rsquo;s comparison of the
soul to an empty writing tablet, Aristotle&rsquo;s complex and widely
debated doctrine of intellect (<em>nous</em>), the problem of the
soul&rsquo;s self-movement, the immortality of the soul and
transmigration, different definitions of soul, and the (Neo)Platonic
doctrine of a world-soul and a first principle of all souls
(<em>hypostasis</em> or monad of soul or &ldquo;soul in
itself&rdquo;).</p>

<p>
From Iamblichus onwards, but already, to a lesser extent, in the Old
Academy and Middle Platonism, Platonists tried to integrate elements
of Aristotle&rsquo;s psychology, especially from his <em>De
anima</em>, into the Platonic system. In the prologue to his
commentary, Simplicius explicitly states how much he is indebted to
Iamblichus&rsquo; lost work:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The primary and most important object of concern is the truth about
things themselves, both about other things and concerning the soul,
which is the most relevant (<em>oikeiotat&ecirc;</em>) of all for us.
Second to this is apprehension (<em>katal&ecirc;psis</em>) of the
opinions of those who have reached the summit of scientific knowledge.
That is why I think it necessary to study very carefully
Aristotle&rsquo;s work <em>On the Soul</em>. Indeed, many divine
insights (<em>polla kai makaria</em>) about the soul have been handed
down by Plato also; but these have been studied and clarified by
Plato&rsquo;s interpreters sufficiently and with unanimity. But, while
Aristotle brought the study of the soul to completion, as is the
opinion of Iamblichus, that excellent judge of truth, there is much
dissension among those who explain his work, not merely about the
interpretation of Aristotle&rsquo;s text (<em>lexis</em>), but also
greatly about the subject-matter itself (<em>auta ta
pragmata</em>).</p>

<p>
That is why I myself decided to investigate and write of the
consistency of the philosopher both with himself and also with the
truth. I shall avoid rejoinders (<em>antirrh&ecirc;seis</em>) to
others, but confirm my views on doubtful matters from the clear
opinions and statements of Aristotle. Everywhere I shall strive to the
uttermost for the truth about things in accordance with the teaching
of Iamblichus in his own writings about the soul. That is my sole
concern. And now, under the Guide who is the cause of all souls and
all reasoning, let us start upon the projected work.
([Pseudo?-]Simplicius, <em>In de Anima</em> 1.3&ndash;21, translated
by J. O. Urmson, slightly modified)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Unlike Aristotle, Plato did not write a systematic treatise on the
soul. The <em>Phaedo</em> comes closest to a work &ldquo;On the
Soul&rdquo;, but it is mainly concerned with the soul&rsquo;s
immortality and the soul&ndash;body relationship. Interestingly, by
far the most frequent references to Plato in (Pseudo-?)Simplicius are
to the <em>Timaeus</em> (almost 30), while there are considerably
fewer (fewer than five) mentions of the <em>Phaedo</em>, the
<em>Republic</em>, and a couple of other dialogues. Not all of these
references regard the soul, but most of them do.</p>

<p>
Why, then, does (Pseudo-?)Simplicius write a commentary on the <em>De
anima</em>? According to him, exploring the truth about the soul is of
special interest for the philosopher, because the soul is of all
things &ldquo;most our own&rdquo; (<em>oikeiotat&ecirc;</em>). This is
so, we may submit, because for the Neoplatonists, self-knowledge is
first and foremost knowledge of our soul, that is, the soul is our
true self according to Plato&rsquo;s <em>Alcibiades I</em> (cf. <em>In
Epict.</em> 3.3&ndash;19). Consistent with this, for instance, is the
fact that (Pseudo-?)Simplicius reads <em>De anima</em> III 4&ndash;5
(the famous, but rather obscure, chapters on the intellect
[<em>nous</em>]) as discussing human rather than divine intellect.
Aristotle&rsquo;s work on the soul is of primary importance because,
according to Iamblichus, the &ldquo;excellent judge of truth&rdquo;,
he has brought psychology to completion.</p>

<p>
Interestingly, (Pseudo-?)Simplicius states that there is a fundamental
agreement among commentators regarding Plato&rsquo;s psychology,
whereas there is still much disagreement about Aristotle&rsquo;s
doctrines. (Pseudo-?)Simplicius aims to explain Aristotle by means of
Aristotle without engaging in debates with other commentators,
although he is often prepared to criticise Alexander of Aphrodisias or
Plutarch of Athens. Explaining &ldquo;Aristotle by means of
Aristotle&rdquo; is important for understanding the coherence of the
work as a whole, but also because some interpreters had accused
Aristotle of contradicting himself (e.g., <em>In de Anima</em>
222.40&ndash;223.1 and 295.16&ndash;19). He chooses Iamblichus as a
guide, as Simplicius did in his <em>Commentary on the
Categories</em>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Everywhere I shall strive to the uttermost for the truth about things
in accordance with the teaching of Iamblichus in his own writings
about the soul. That is my sole concern. ([Pseudo-?]Simplicius, <em>In
de Anima</em> 1.18&ndash;20, translated by J. O. Urmson, slightly
modified)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Following Iamblichus does not mean that (Pseudo-?)Simplicius could not
differ from him on issues regarding the <em>skopos</em> or the
question whether the celestial spheres possess perception and
imagination (Steel 2013: 6 and n. 525).</p>

<p>
Like the commentaries by Simplicius, the <em>Commentary on De
anima</em> also includes a preface (<em>In de Anima</em>
1.3&ndash;6.5). However, rather surprisingly, (Pseudo-?)Simplicius
discusses only two of the usual six/seven issues in the classical
introductory scheme for a Neoplatonic commentary on Aristotle, namely,
the main topic of the work (<em>skopos</em>) and the part of
philosophy to which it belongs (psychology). (Pseudo-?)Simplicius
observes that the main topic is obviously about the soul, but not
about every soul, because Aristotle does not, for instance, talk about
the world-soul or the soul of the heavenly bodies. Rather, the work is
about the soul of &ldquo;mortal animals&rdquo; (<em>In de Anima</em>
3.29&ndash;30) and, as he specifies some pages later, &ldquo;its
essential properties&rdquo; (<em>In de Anima</em> 8.25&ndash;27). In
the beginning of book three, somewhat unusually, yet another, more
specific scope is determined, namely &ldquo;the reasoning and
intellective soul in mortal beings&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The primary purpose in the third book is to discuss the soul which
makes choices, that is the reasoning and intellective soul in mortal
beings since in the whole treatise he has embarked on the
investigation of the soul in mortal beings, because from there we will
perhaps be moved on, by some analogy, to higher souls, and especially
so from the rational soul in these beings. In the second book he
taught mainly about the soul which is common to other living beings as
well: in the third he has set the main task as being about the
rational soul. ([Pseudo-?]Simplicius, <em>In de Anima</em>
172.4&ndash;11, translated by H. J. Blumenthal)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is interesting to note that although (Pseudo-?)Simplicius states at
the outset that he is following Iamblichus throughout, the latter had
defined the scope of the work as being about the intellect superior to
the soul (<em>In de Anima</em> 313.1&ndash;4), while Alexander of
Aphrodisias interpreted it as divine intellect (God), a reading that
Simplicius firmly opposed:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
And in the same way, they think the soul has much that is enmattered
in regard to its sensations and imaginations and potential intellect
(<em>ho dunamei nous</em>); but in regard to the actual intellect
(<em>ho energei&#257;i nous</em>), which Aristotle shows to be itself
the highest part (<em>akron</em>) of the soul, even if Alexander
doesn't think so, they say that the soul has separability
(<em>ch&ocirc;riston</em>) from matter. (Simplicius, <em>In Phys.</em>
2.2&ndash;6, translated by R. Barney and S. Menn, forthcoming)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Pseudo-?)Simplicius is very careful not to overemphasise his
disagreement with Iamblichus and aims at a kind of rapprochement at
<em>In Anima</em> 313.1&ndash;32. On the other hand, one might ask
whether the two aims given by (Pseudo-?)Simplicius are not at variance
with Iamblichus&rsquo; maxim that each work should have only one
<em>skopos</em>. Compare, for instance, Simplicius&rsquo; criticism of
how Alexander determined the main topic of <em>On the Heavens</em>
 (<a href="#CommArisHeav">&sect;3</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Regarding the science of the soul (psychology) and hence the part of
philosophy under study, (Pseudo-?)Simplicius asserts, referring to
Aristotle (<em>De part. an</em>. I 1), that as the soul is between the
sensible and the intelligible, psychology is between natural science
and metaphysics:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he study of the soul is neither simply natural nor simply
metaphysical, but belongs to both, as was determined by Aristotle in
the passage quoted [sc. <em>De part. an</em>. I 1].
([Pseudo-?]Simplicius, <em>In Anima</em> 3.5&ndash;6, translated by
J.O. Urmson)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Steel (2013: 7&ndash;9) has pointed out that such a theory, which is
rather fundamental for (Pseudo-?)Simplicius&rsquo; approach, goes back
to Iamblichus and his view that the soul is at the same time paradigm
and image, that is, paradigm of the sensible world and image of the
intelligibles.</p>

<p>
What about the other issues usually discussed in a preface? The title
(<em>epigraph&ecirc;</em>) can be accepted as self-evident, and
probably no one in Antiquity disputed the authenticity
(<em>gn&ecirc;sion</em>) of the work. The division into chapters
(<em>dihairesis eis kephalaia</em>) is usually discussed at the
beginning of a book, but (Pseudo-?)Simplicius does not do this. What
is more, he does not explicitly say why the study of psychology is
useful (<em>chr&ecirc;simon</em>), unless his introductory sentence
should be understood as pointing in this direction (&ldquo;The primary
and most important object of concern is the truth about things
themselves, both about other things and concerning the soul, which is
the most relevant (<em>oikeiotat&ecirc;</em>) of all for us&rdquo;;
<em>In de Anima</em> 1.2&ndash;5, translated by J. O. Urmson, slightly
modified). He also does not say when, in the order of
Aristotle&rsquo;s works, the book should be read (<em>taxis
anagn&ocirc;se&ocirc;s</em>), but it would probably be after the works
on natural science and the <em>Metaphysics</em> since, as we have
seen, it partakes in both.</p>

<p>
Just as Simplicius does not tire of pointing out the harmony of Plato
and Aristotle in the prefaces to his commentaries (see
 <a href="index-2.html#HarmPlatArisChriThre">&sect;6 in the main article</a>),
 (Pseudo-?)Simplicius also refers time and again in his running
commentary to executing strategies of harmonisation that are already
known to us from Simplicius. (Pseudo-?)Simplicius calls Aristotle
Plato&rsquo;s &ldquo;best interpreter&rdquo; (<em>aristos
ex&ecirc;g&ecirc;t&ecirc;s</em>) and argues that there exists a
harmony (<em>sumph&ocirc;nia</em>) between Plato and Aristotle (e.g.,
<em>In de Anima</em> 98.9&ndash;11; 246.18&ndash;19; 247.13&ndash;15;
for a collection of such passages see Steel 2013: 33&ndash;34 n. 18).
What is more, like Simplicius, (Pseudo-?)Simplicius criticises
Aristotle, but never Plato. However, even though (Pseudo-?)Simplicius
alludes to the harmony between Plato and Aristotle, it seems be less
important to him than the inner coherence of Aristotle himself.</p>

<p>
The following subsections address selected topics in the
commentary.</p>

<h4 id="DefiFacuHumaSoul">5.1 Definition and faculties of the human soul</h4>

<p>
The <em>Commentary on the De anima</em> is thoroughly Neoplatonic in
character. It includes several elements that are typical of (later)
Neoplatonic psychology, many of which are already in Proclus and may
ultimately go back to Iamblichus. First, Neoplatonists regarded the
soul as immortal, subject to transmigration, and in itself an
essentially incorporeal entity. Therefore, they did not consider
Aristotle&rsquo;s definition of soul as &ldquo;the first actualisation
of a body that potentially has life&rdquo; (<em>De anima</em> II 1,
412a19&ndash;21) to be adequate, because it does not concern the soul
in itself and its real, separate essence. (Pseudo-?)Simplicius
explains that Aristotle&rsquo;s definition only concerns the soul that
has alienated itself from its real essence and come into contact with
a body.</p>

<p>
While Aristotle favours a bottom-up approach to the several faculties
of the soul, starting with the most fundamental (i.e., vegetative)
faculty that all animals share, Neoplatonists derive lower faculties
from higher ones (top-down), quite similar to the derivation of all
things from the One; the soul has many faculties/powers
(<em>polydunamos</em>) and is manifold in substance
(<em>polyousios</em>). What is called substance can also be called the
life (<em>z&ocirc;&ecirc;</em>) of the soul (<em>In de Anima</em>
305.17: &ldquo;life is substance&rdquo;):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
That among generated beings there are many forms of life and that some
are inferior and ultimate and others ascend somewhat until they reach
the level of the intellect that is capable of discernment, and that
the inferior and ultimate forms of life always co-exist with the
superior but not always vice versa, the superior with the inferior,
has already been concluded through what was said before.
([Pseudo-?]Simplicius, <em>In de Anima</em> 321.5&ndash;9, translated
by C. Steel)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(Pseudo?-)Simplicius talks not only about different faculties or lives
of the soul, but also asserts that the soul is <em>poludunamos</em>
(&ldquo;possessing many powers&rdquo;) and even &ldquo;manifold in
substance&rdquo; (<em>poluousios</em>; cf. Helmig 2014). This,
however, does not mean that it is not a unity; rather, it is a
multitude in unity (<em>pl&ecirc;thos kat&rsquo;
hen&ocirc;sin</em>):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
One should not be surprised to see that he talks about
&ldquo;part&rdquo; in the case of the soul, though in the first [book]
he rejected this terminology, assuming that the soul was not
divisible, &lt;and talked about&gt; &ldquo;powers&rdquo;, which others
call &ldquo;parts&rdquo;. But he knows that in the case of immaterial
things there is no power that is not substantial. Hence, as the soul
has many powers (<em>poludunamos</em>), it is also manifold in
substance (<em>poluousios</em>), not that it has this multitude of
substances torn asunder (for he contradicts that), but it has that
multitude in unity, as the unity in substance is greater than in
powers, insofar as substance is more excellent than power. And
therefore he assigns to the soul what is most evident, namely that it
is of many powers, but he indicates that it is also manifold in
substance in a unified way, as said, because he speaks also of
&ldquo;parts&rdquo;. ([Pseudo-?]Simplicius, <em>In de Anima</em>
286.34&ndash;287.4, translated by C. Steel)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="SelfAlieSelfKnow">5.2 Self-alienation and self-knowledge</h4>

<p>
The movement of self-alienation is expressed by means of the
characteristically Neoplatonic triad of remaining, proceeding, return
(<em>mon&ecirc;</em>, <em>prohodos</em>, <em>epistroph&ecirc;</em>).
This triadic scheme is also at work in (Pseudo-?)Simplicius&rsquo;
interesting exegesis of the difficult chapters on intellect (<em>De
anima</em> III 4&ndash;5). As noted above, (Pseudo-?)Simplicius
interprets the intellect as human rational soul: a rational soul with
two faculties of knowledge, discursive thought and intellect (cf.
<em>Tim.</em> 28a, <em>no&ecirc;sis meta logou</em>). When the soul
thinks its proper objects are engaged in scientific activity, it
remains in itself (<em>mon&ecirc;</em>). However, once it turns
towards the body and sense perception, it alienates itself from itself
(<em>prohodos</em>). Eventually, it manages again to return to its
true self (<em>epistroph&ecirc;</em>) and become one with its true
essence. The different activities or aspects of intellect are not, as
might be suspected, to be identified with different kinds of
intellects. Rather, it is one and the same human intellect that
undergoes different phases. When connecting to a body, the soul
changes in a way; it is essentially, in the words of Carlos Steel,
&ldquo;a changing self&rdquo; (Steel 1978). Like other Neoplatonists,
(Pseudo-?)Simplicius downplays Aristotle&rsquo;s dictum that
&ldquo;the soul never thinks without a phantasm&rdquo; (<em>De
anima</em> III 7, 431a16&ndash;17; see Steel 2018). In the
soul&rsquo;s rational activity, when it &ldquo;remains by
itself&rdquo;, it can entirely do away with imagination. It is only
when it &ldquo;proceeds&rdquo; towards the body that imagination is
needed.</p>

<p>
The true essence of the soul consists of psychic Forms
(<em>eid&ecirc;</em>), i.e., images of transcendent Platonic Forms,
the intelligible causes of all things (cf. <em>In Cat.</em>
12.19&ndash;25). Since they make up the soul&rsquo;s essence, they are
already in Proclus, called essential (<em>ousi&ocirc;d&ecirc;</em>).
In the words of (Pseudo-?)Simplicius, the soul &ldquo;is the forms in
a secondary manner&rdquo; (<em>In de Anima</em> 258.29). The
soul&rsquo;s returning to itself is prerequisite for knowing oneself.
This motif is well-known from Neoplatonic commentaries on the
<em>Alcibiades I</em>. The soul knows itself, and because it consists
of the causes of all things, self-knowledge equals knowledge of these
principles. It is noteworthy that (Pseudo-?)Simplicius discusses in
great detail the practical intellect, practical reasoning (&ldquo;the
soul which makes choices&rdquo;), human motivation, desire, and the
practical syllogism from <em>De anima</em> III 7&ndash;11.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The primary purpose in the third book is to discuss the soul which
makes choices, that is the reasoning and intellective soul in mortal
beings [&hellip;]. ([Pseudo-?]Simplicius, <em>In de Anima</em>
172.4&ndash;5, translated by H. J. Blumenthal)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Practical intellect can in turn be identified with the
&ldquo;outgoing&rdquo; intellect from <em>De anima</em> III 4&ndash;5.
The comments on the third book of <em>De anima</em> (undoubtedly the
most interesting and substantial part of the commentary) have a lot to
say about practical philosophy and can therefore be considered as an
important late Neoplatonic contribution to ethics. In this respect,
there are several points of similarity to the <em>Commentary on the
Handbook of Epictetus</em>.</p>

<h4 id="CritAbstSoulPlacFormTopoEidn">5.3 Criticism of abstraction and the soul as the place of the forms (<em>topos eid&ocirc;n</em>)</h4>

<p>
Several arguments in (Pseudo-?)Simplicius are directed toward
criticizing the method of abstracting universals from sensible
particulars: Abstraction (<em>aphairesis</em>) is not a functional
method for arriving at mathematical concepts; by abstracting from
sensible particulars, we can never obtain entities that are more
perfect than those particulars; and the results of abstraction would
lack the precision (<em>to akribes</em>) required for geometrical
operations. These arguments are familiar from the Neoplatonic
tradition preceding (Pseudo-?)Simplicius and can be found, for
instance, in Proclus and his teacher Syrianus (Helmig 2012:
205&ndash;221). However, in contrast to Syrianus and Proclus,
(Pseudo-?)Simplicius does not criticise Aristotle as a champion of
abstraction, but rather, the Peripatetic tradition after him. This is
part of the harmonisation of Plato and Aristotle. From this
perspective, abstraction in mathematics emerges as a misguided reading
of Aristotle. For (Pseudo-?)Simplicius (and Proclus and Syrianus),
mathematical objects are not abstracted, but are rather projected from
the essential reason-principles (<em>logoi</em>) in the soul:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]he [mathematical] objects in the imagination are not such as some
Peripatetics seem to call them &ldquo;from abstraction&rdquo; (<em>ex
aphairese&ocirc;s</em>), as if they were completely without substance
on account of the fact that they are separated from the substances in
the sensible realm. For the [mathematical] objects of imagination,
too, are related to living reason-principles (<em>z&ocirc;tikoi
logoi</em>), which are substances, as is demonstrated by their
precision (<em>to akribes</em>), which is greater than that of
perceptible objects, and by the fact that they add what is lacking [in
perceptible objects] and remove what is superfluous. These
[mathematical] objects could not be produced from outside nor have
what is better from the worse, but they are clearly the immediate
result of the projection by the living reason-principles themselves
[&hellip;]. ([Pseudo-?]Simplicius, <em>In de Anima</em>
277.22&ndash;28, translated by C. Steel)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Criticisms of abstraction usually go hand-in-hand with a theory of
innate knowledge, and so it is with (Pseudo-?)Simplicius. He
interprets the soul as being essentially composed of reason-principles
(<em>logoi</em>) that are images of the transcendent Forms. Against
this background, how he interprets Aristotle&rsquo;s well-known
assertion that the soul is &ldquo;the place of forms&rdquo; (<em>topos
eid&ocirc;n</em>; see Steel 2016, who does not, however, discuss
[Pseudo-?]Simplicius) is somewhat peculiar. The latter do not
represent, as one might expect, the innate knowledge of the soul, but
are &ldquo;acquired forms&rdquo;, that is, forms from outside. Place
(<em>topos</em>), in this sense, receives what comes from outside, and
the forms in question are not innate, but what the outgoing intellect
(potential intellect), as discussed above, collects:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[The &ldquo;place of forms&rdquo;] is a place in so far as it receives
things that it acquires, somehow from outside, so that the analogy
with physical place is kept. If so, the faculty that is entirely
intellectual will not be place, but rather the one that has been
talked about and, in general, the one that flows to the outside
(<em>ex&ocirc; rhueisa</em>), since the one that remains where it is
is the forms corresponding to it, but does not receive them, and the
one that departs from itself is in potency and not in actuality, while
the one that turns to itself as a whole and is at rest in accordance
with its own substance is no longer potential but in act, or rather
its act is it. ([Pseudo-?]Simplicius, <em>In de Anima</em>
228.1&ndash;7, translated by H. Blumenthal)</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="AuthCommDeAnim">5.4 Author of the <em>Commentary on De Anima</em></h4>

<p>
This is certainly not the right place to discuss the highly debated
problem of the authorship of this commentary in greater detail;
instead, several issues that have shaped the discussion are briefly
described. There are basically three opinions regarding who may have
written this commentary. The first group (Henry Blumenthal and others)
is convinced that Simplicius cannot be its author but does not want to
speculate about the author&rsquo;s true identity, referring to the
author instead, in absence of a better solution, as Pseudo-Simplicius.
The second group (Fernand Bossier, Carlos Steel, and Matthias Perkams)
considers Priscian of Lydia, who also took part in the embassy of
philosophers who travelled to Persia after 529, to be the
commentary&rsquo;s author. A third group (I. Hadot and Frans de Haas)
defends the attribution of the manuscript to Simplicius. While de Haas
is rather cautious in this respect, Hadot has repeatedly argued for
the authenticity of the work, not always abstaining from polemics.</p>

<p>
Doubts about the identity of the author extend back to the
Renaissance. Francesco Piccolomini (1520&ndash;1604) was rather
confident that Simplicius could not be its author, and suggested
Priscian of Lydia as an alternative. Indeed, the style and method are
quite different from Simplicius&rsquo; other commentaries on
Aristotle. The author also refers several times to other works of his.
However, the referenced works are, according to Bossier and Steel
(1972) and Steel (1997), not to be found among Simplicius&rsquo;
extant works. Hence, the arguments are based on style and on
self-references.</p>

<p>
Regarding the style of the commentary, a methodological difficulty is
that we have relatively few texts from Priscian of Lydia for making a
convincing style comparison. In addition, the style of <em>In De
anima</em> may be partially based on what the author says in the
preface, namely, that he </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
shall avoid rejoinders (<em>antirrh&ecirc;seis</em>) to others, but
confirm [his] views on doubtful matters from the clear opinions and
statements of Aristotle. (<em>In de Anima</em> 1.16&ndash;18,
translated by J. O. Urmson, slightly modified) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We also cannot rule out that the work was written by a younger or
relatively inexperienced person (a young Simplicius?), since he
compares himself to those who have already &ldquo;reached the summit
of knowledge&rdquo; (<em>In de Anima</em> 1.5&ndash;6 and
313.6&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
Another question concerns what to make of the self-references and
parallels to the commentary on Priscian&rsquo;s <em>Epitome of
Theophrastus</em>. While Steel (1997: 126&ndash;137) and Perkams
(2012) think that the question constitutes a decisive argument, others
retort that the parallels can be explained by means of a common
source. The doctrines of the commentary also remain a matter of
debate: Are they compatible with what Simplicius maintains elsewhere?
Here, as well, there are arguments that go in opposite directions.
Hadot has repeatedly argued that the <em>Commentary on the De
anima</em> exhibits several parallels with the <em>Commentary on the
Handbook of Epictetus</em> (I. Hadot 1995: 61&ndash;113), while Steel
denies this, especially regarding the doctrine of the soul as changing
self, which is alluded to above.</p>

<p>
Finally, it might be asked whether there are any arguments that speak
against Priscian as an author. Interestingly, Priscian and Simplicius
differ in their reading of <em>De anima</em> III 4&ndash;5. While
Simplicius maintains that it is about the rational human soul,
Priscian seems to consider it to be about the divine intellect
(<em>Metaphr.</em> 25.27&ndash;37.34, esp. 34.24&ndash;28 and
35.19&ndash;23). Once again, however, it is unclear whether such a
difference is decisive for settling the vexed issue of authorship.</p>

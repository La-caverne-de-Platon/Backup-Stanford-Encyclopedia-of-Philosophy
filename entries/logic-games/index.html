<h1>Logic and Games</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Fri Jul 27, 2001; substantive revision Fri Aug 16, 2019</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Games between two players, of the kind where one player wins and one
loses, became a familiar tool in many branches of logic during the
second half of the twentieth century. Important examples are semantic
games used to define truth, back-and-forth games used to compare
structures, and dialogue games to express (and perhaps explain) formal
proofs.</p>

<h2><a name="GamHisLog">1. Games in the History of Logic</a></h2>

<p>
The links between logic and games go back a long way. If one thinks of
a debate as a kind of game, then Aristotle already made the
connection; his writings about syllogism are closely intertwined with
his study of the aims and rules of debating. Aristotle&rsquo;s
viewpoint survived into the common medieval name for logic:
<em>dialectics</em>. In the mid twentieth century Charles Hamblin
revived the link between dialogue and the rules of sound reasoning,
soon after Paul Lorenzen had connected dialogue to constructive
foundations of logic. </p>

<p>
There are close links between games and teaching. Writers throughout
the medieval period talk of dialogues as a way of
&lsquo;teaching&rsquo; or &lsquo;testing&rsquo; the use of sound
reasoning. We have at least two textbooks of logic from the early
sixteenth century that present it as a game for an individual student,
and Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s <em>The Game of Logic</em> (1887) is another
example in the same genre. There are plenty of modern examples too,
though probably there has not been enough continuity to justify
talking of a tradition of teaching logic by games. </p>

<p>
Mathematical game theory was founded in the early twentieth century.
Although no mathematical links with logic emerged until the 1950s, it
is striking how many of the early pioneers of game theory are also
known for their contributions to logic: John Kemeny, J. C. C.
McKinsey, John von Neumann, Willard Quine, Julia Robinson, Ernst
Zermelo and others. In 1953 David Gale and Frank Stewart made fruitful
connections between set theory and games. Shortly afterwards Leon
Henkin suggested a way of using games to give semantics for infinitary
languages.</p>

<p>
The first half of the twentieth century was an era of increasing
rigour and professionalism in logic, and to most logicians of that
period the use of games in logic would probably have seemed frivolous.
The intuitionist L. E. J. Brouwer expressed this attitude when he
accused his opponents of causing mathematics &lsquo;to degenerate into
a game&rsquo; (as David Hilbert quoted him in 1927, cited in van
Heijenoort 1967). Hermann Weyl (cited in Mancosu 1998) used the notion
of games to explain Hilbert&rsquo;s metamathematics: mathematical
proofs proceed like plays of a meaningless game, but we can stand
outside the game and ask meaningful questions about it.
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s language games provoked little response from the
logicians. But in the second half of the century the centre of gravity
of logical research moved from foundations to techniques, and from
about 1960 games were used more and more often in logical papers.</p>

<p>
By the beginning of the twenty-first century it had become widely
accepted that games and logic go together. The result was a huge
proliferation of new combinations of logic and games, particularly in
areas where logic is applied. Many of these new developments sprang
originally from work in pure logic, though today they follow their own
agendas. One such area is argumentation theory, where games form a
tool for analysing the structure of debates. </p>

<p>
Below we will concentrate on those games that are most closely
associated with pure logic.</p>

<h2><a name="LogGam">2. Logical Games</a></h2>

<p>
From the point of view of game theory, the main games that logicians
study are not at all typical. They normally involve just two players,
they often have infinite length, the only outcomes are winning and
losing, and no probabilities are attached to actions or outcomes. The
barest essentials of a logical game are as follows. </p>

<p>
There are two players. In general we can call them \(\forall\) and
\(\exists\). The pronunciations &lsquo;Abelard&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Eloise&rsquo; go back to the mid 1980s and usefully fix the
players as male and female making reference easier: her move, his
move. Other names are in common use for the players in particular
types of logical game.</p>

<p>
The players play by choosing elements of a set \(\Omega\), called the
<em>domain</em> of the game. As they choose, they build up a
sequence</p> 

\[
a_0, a_1, a_2,\ldots
\]

<p>
of elements of \(\Omega\). Infinite sequences of elements of
\(\Omega\) are called <em>plays</em>. Finite sequences of elements of
\(\Omega\) are called <em>positions</em>; they record where a play
might have got to by a certain time. A function \(\tau\) (the <em>turn
function</em> or <em>player function</em>) takes each position
\(\mathbf{a}\) to either \(\exists\) or \(\forall\); if
\(\tau(\mathbf{a}) = \exists\), this means that when the game has
reached \(\mathbf{a}\), player \(\exists\) makes the next choice (and
likewise with \(\forall)\). The game rules define two sets
\(\W_{\forall}\) and \(\W_{\exists}\) consisting of positions and
plays, with the following properties: if a position \(\mathbf{a}\) is
in \(\W_{\forall}\) then so is any play or longer position that starts
with \(\mathbf{a}\) (and likewise with \(\W_{\exists})\); and no play
is in both \(\W_{\forall}\) and \(\W_{\exists}\). We say that player
\(\forall\) <em>wins</em> a play \(\mathbf{b}\), and that
\(\mathbf{b}\) is a <em>win</em> for \(\forall\), if \(\mathbf{b}\) is
in \(\W_{\forall}\); if some position \(\mathbf{a}\) that is an
initial segment of \(\mathbf{b}\) is in \(\W_{\forall}\), then we say
that player \(\forall\) <em>wins already at</em> \(\mathbf{a}\). (And
likewise with \(\exists\) and \(\W_{\exists}\).) So to summarise, a
logical game is a 4-tuple \((\Omega , \tau\), \(\W_{\forall}\),
\(\W_{\exists})\) with the properties just described.</p>

<p>
We say that a logical game is <em>total</em> if every play is in
either \(\W_{\forall}\) or \(\W_{\exists}\), so that there are no
draws. Unless one makes an explicit exception, logical games are
always assumed to be total. (Don&rsquo;t confuse being total with the
much stronger property of being determined&mdash;see below.)</p>

<p>
It is only for mathematical convenience that the definition above
expects the game to continue to infinity even when a player has won at
some finite position; there is no interest in anything that happens
after a player has won. Many logical games have the property that in
every play, one of the players has already won at some finite
position; games of this sort are said to be <em>well-founded</em>. An
even stronger condition is that there is some finite number \(n\) such
that in every play, one of the players has already won by the \(n\)-th
position; in this case we say that the game has <em>finite
length</em>.</p>

<p>
A <em>strategy</em> for a player is a set of rules that describe
exactly how that player should choose, depending on how the two
players have chosen at earlier moves. Mathematically, a strategy for
\(\forall\) consists of a function which takes each position
\(\mathbf{a}\) with \(\tau(\mathbf{a}) = \forall\) to an element \(b\)
of \(\Omega\); we think of it as an instruction to \(\forall\) to
choose \(b\) when the game has reached the position \(\mathbf{a}\).
(Likewise with a strategy for \(\exists\).) A strategy for a player is
said to be <em>winning</em> if that player wins every play in which he
or she uses the strategy, regardless of what the other player does. At
most one of the players has a winning strategy (since otherwise the
players could play their winning strategies against each other, and
both would win, contradicting that \(\W_{\forall}\) and
\(\W_{\exists}\) have no plays in common). Occasionally one meets
situations in which it seems that two players have winning strategies
(for example in the forcing games below), but closer inspection shows
that the two players are in fact playing different games.</p>

<p>
A game is said to be <em>determined</em> if one or other of the
players has a winning strategy. There are many examples of games that
are not determined, as Gale and Stewart showed in 1953 using the axiom
of choice. This discovery led to important applications of the notion
of determinacy in the foundations of set theory (see entry on
 <a href="../large-cardinals-determinacy/index.html">large cardinals and determinacy</a>).
 Gale and Stewart also proved an important theorem that bears their
name: Every well-founded game is determined. It follows that every
game of finite length is determined&mdash;a fact already known to
Zermelo in 1913. (A more precise statement of the Gale-Stewart theorem
is this. A game \(G\) is said to be <em>closed</em> if \(\exists\)
wins every play of \(G\) in which she hasn&rsquo;t already lost at any
finite position. The theorem states that every closed game is
determined. The proof of the theorem is basically easy: Let us call a
position winning for \(\forall\) if he has a winning strategy starting
from this position. Suppose \(\forall\) does not have a winning
strategy in the game, that is, in the beginning the position is not
winning for \(\forall\). If the first move is a move of \(\forall\),
after his move the position is still not winning for him. If the first
move is a move of \(\exists\), she must have a move after which the
position is still not winning for \(\forall\), for otherwise the
previous position would have been winning for \(\forall\). The game
goes on in this way infinitely many moves through positions which are
not winning for \(\forall\). Because the game is closed, \(\exists\)
wins.)</p>

<p>
Just as in classical game theory, the definition of logical games
above serves as a clothes horse that we can hang other concepts onto.
For example it is common to have some laws that describe what elements
of \(\Omega\) are available for a player to choose at a particular
move. Strictly this refinement is unnecessary, because the winning
strategies are not affected if we decree instead that a player who
breaks the law loses immediately; but for many games this way of
viewing them seems unnatural. Below we will see some other extra
features that can be added to games.</p>

<p>
The definitions of game and strategy above were purely mathematical.
So they left out what is probably the single most important feature of
games, which is that people play them (at least metaphorically). The
players aim to win, and by studying the strategies open to them we
study what behaviour is rational for a person with a particular aim.
In most games there are several players, so we can study what is a
rational response to somebody else&rsquo;s behaviour. By restricting
the players&rsquo; moves and possible strategies, we can study bounded
rationality, where an agent has to make rational decisions under
conditions of limited information, memory or time. </p>

<p>
In short, games are used for modelling rationality and bounded
rationality. This is independent of any connection with logic. But
some logics were designed for studying aspects of rational behaviour,
and in recent years it has become increasingly common to link these
logics to suitable games. See Section 5 (&lsquo;Semantic games for
other logics&rsquo;) and its bibliography.</p>

<p>
But until recently, logical games were connected with rational
behaviour in a quite different way. On the surface, the logic in
question had no direct connection with behaviour. But logicians and
mathematicians noticed that some ideas could be made more intuitive if
they were linked to possible aims. For example in many applications of
logical games, the central notion is that of a winning strategy for
the player \(\exists\). Often these strategies (or their existence)
turn out to be equivalent to something of logical importance that
could have been defined without using games&mdash;for example a proof.
But games are felt to give a better definition because they quite
literally supply some motivation: \(\exists\) is trying to win.</p>

<p>
This raises a question that is not of much interest mathematically,
but it should concern philosophers who use logical games. If we want
\(\exists\)&rsquo;s motivation in a game \(G\) to have any explanatory
value, then we need to understand what is achieved if \(\exists\) does
win. In particular we should be able to tell a realistic story of a
situation in which some agent called \(\exists\) is trying to do
something intelligible, and doing it is the same thing as winning in
the game. As Richard Dawkins said, raising the corresponding question
for the evolutionary games of Maynard Smith,</p>

<blockquote>
The whole purpose of our search &hellip; is to discover a suitable
actor to play the leading role in our metaphors of purpose. We
&hellip; want to say, &lsquo;It is for the good of &hellip; &lsquo;.
Our quest in this chapter is for the right way to complete that
sentence. (<em>The Extended Phenotype</em>, Oxford University Press,
Oxford 1982, page 91.)
</blockquote>

<p>
For future reference let us call this the <em>Dawkins question</em>.
In many kinds of logical game it turns out to be distinctly harder to
answer than the pioneers of these games realised. (Marion 2009
discusses the Dawkins question further.)</p>

<h2><a name="SemGam">3. Semantic Games for Classical Logic</a></h2>

<p>
In the early 1930s Alfred Tarski proposed a definition of truth. His
definition consisted of a necessary and sufficient condition for a
sentence in the language of a typical formal theory to be true; his
necessary and sufficient condition used only notions from syntax and
set theory, together with the primitive notions of the formal theory
in question. In fact Tarski defined the more general relation
&lsquo;formula \(\phi(x_1 ,\ldots ,x_n)\) is true of the elements
\(a_1 ,\ldots ,a_n\)&rsquo;; truth of a sentence is the special case
where \(n = 0\). For example the question whether </p>

<p class="indent">
&lsquo;For all \(x\) there is \(y\) such that R\((x, y)\)&rsquo; is
true</p>

<p>
reduces to the question whether the following holds:</p>

<p class="indent">
For every object \(a\) the sentence &lsquo;There is \(y\) such that
R\((a, y)\)&rsquo; is true.</p>

<p>
This in turn reduces to:</p>

<p class="indent">
For every object \(a\) there is an object \(b\) such that the sentence
&lsquo;R\((a, b)\)&rsquo; is true.</p>

<p>
In this example, that&rsquo;s as far as Tarski&rsquo;s truth
definition will take us.</p>

<p>
In the late 1950s Leon Henkin noticed that we can intuitively
understand some sentences which can&rsquo;t be handled by
Tarski&rsquo;s definition. Take for example the infinitely long
sentence</p>

<p class="indent">
For all \(x_0\) there is \(y_0\) such that for all \(x_1\) there is
\(y_1\) such that &hellip; R\((x_0, y_0, x_1, y_1,\ldots)\).</p>

<p>
Tarski&rsquo;s approach fails because the string of quantifiers at the
beginning is infinite, and we would never reach an end of stripping
them off. Instead, Henkin suggested, we should consider the game where
a person \(\forall\) chooses an object \(a_0\) for \(x_0\), then a
second person \(\exists\) chooses an object \(b_0\) for \(y_0\), then
\(\forall\) chooses \(a_1\) for \(x_1, \exists\) chooses \(b_1\) for
\(y_1\) and so on. A play of this game is a win for \(\exists\) if and
only if the infinite atomic sentence</p> 

\[
\R(a_0, b_0, a_1, b_1,\ldots)
\]

<p>
is true. The original sentence is true if and only if player
\(\exists\) has a winning strategy for this game. Strictly Henkin used
the game only as a metaphor, and the truth condition that he proposed
was that the skolemised version of the sentence is true, i.e. that
there are functions \(f_0, f_1,\ldots\) such that for every choice of
\(a_0, a_1, a_2\) etc. we have</p> 

\[ 
\R(a_0, f_0 (a_0), a_1, f_1 (a_0, a_1), a_2, f_2 (a_0, a_1, a_2),\ldots).
\]

<p>
But this condition translates immediately into the language of games;
the Skolem functions \(f_0\) etc. define a winning strategy for
\(\exists\), telling her how to choose in the light of earlier choices
by \(\forall\). (It came to light sometime later that C. S. Peirce had
already suggested explaining the difference between
&lsquo;every&rsquo; and &lsquo;some&rsquo; in terms of who chooses the
object; for example in his second Cambridge Conference lecture of
1898.)</p>

<p>
Soon after Henkin&rsquo;s work, Jaakko Hintikka added that the same
idea applies with conjunctions and disjunctions. We can regard a
conjunction &lsquo;\(\phi \wedge \psi\)&rsquo; as a universally
quantified statement expressing &lsquo;Every one of the sentences
\(\phi , \psi\) holds&rsquo;, so it should be for the player
\(\forall\) to choose one of the sentences. As Hintikka put it, to
play the game \(G(\phi \wedge \psi), \forall\) chooses whether the
game should proceed as \(G(\phi)\) or as \(G(\psi)\). Likewise
disjunctions become existentially quantified statements about sets of
sentences, and they mark moves where the player \(\exists\) chooses
how the game should proceed. To bring quantifiers into the same style,
he proposed that the game \(G(\forall x \phi(x))\) proceeds thus:
player \(\forall\) chooses an object and provides a name \(a\) for it,
and the game proceeds as \(G(\phi(a))\). (And likewise with
existential quantifiers, except that \(\exists\) chooses.) Hintikka
also made an ingenious suggestion for introducing negation. Each game
G has a <em>dual game</em> which is the same as G except that the
players \(\forall\) and \(\exists\) are transposed in both the rules
for playing and the rules for winning. The game \(G(\neg \phi)\) is
the dual of \(G(\phi)\).</p>

<p>
One can prove that for any first-order sentence \(\phi\), interpreted
in a fixed structure \(A\), player \(\exists\) has a winning strategy
for Hintikka&rsquo;s game \(G(\phi)\) if and only if \(\phi\) is true
in \(A\) in the sense of Tarski. Two features of this proof are
interesting. First, if \(\phi\) is any first-order sentence then the
game \(G(\phi)\) has finite length, and so the Gale-Stewart theorem
tells us that it is determined. We infer that \(\exists\) has a
winning strategy in exactly one of \(G(\phi)\) and its dual; so she
has a winning strategy in \(G(\neg \phi)\) if and only if she
doesn&rsquo;t have one in \(G(\phi)\). This takes care of negation.
And second, if \(\exists\) has a winning strategy for each game
\(G(\phi(a))\), then after choosing one such strategy \(f_a\) for each
\(a\), she can string them together into a single winning strategy for
\(G(\forall x \phi(x))\) (namely, &lsquo;Wait and see what element \(a
\forall\) chooses, then play \(f_a\)&rsquo;). This takes care of the
clause for universal quantifiers; but the argument uses the axiom of
choice, and in fact it is not hard to see that the statement that
Hintikka&rsquo;s and Tarski&rsquo;s definitions of truth are
equivalent is itself equivalent to the axiom of choice (given the
other axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory).</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s puzzling that we have here two theories of when a sentence
is true, and the theories are not equivalent if the axiom of choice
fails. In fact the reason is not very deep. The axiom of choice is
needed not because the Hintikka definition uses games, but because it
assumes that strategies are deterministic, i.e. that they are
single-valued functions giving the user no choice of options. A more
natural way of translating the Tarski definition into game terms is to
use nondeterministic strategies, sometimes called quasistrategies (see
Kolaitis 1985 for details). (However, Hintikka 1996 insists that the
correct explication of &lsquo;true&rsquo; is the one using
deterministic strategies, and that this fact vindicates the axiom of
choice.)</p>

<p>
Computer implementations of these games of Hintikka proved to be a
very effective way of teaching the meanings of first-order sentences.
One such package was designed by Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy at
Stanford, called &lsquo;Tarski&rsquo;s World&rsquo;. Independently
another team at the University of Omsk constructed a Russian version
for use at schools for gifted children.</p>

<p>
In the published version of his John Locke lectures at Oxford,
Hintikka in 1973 raised the Dawkins question (see above) for these
games. His answer was that one should look to Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
language games, and the language games for understanding quantifiers
are those which revolve around seeking and finding. In the
corresponding logical games one should think of \(\exists\) as Myself
and \(\forall\) as a hostile Nature who can never be relied on to
present the object I want; so to be sure of finding it, I need a
winning strategy. This story was never very convincing; the motivation
of Nature is irrelevant, and nothing in the logical game corresponds
to seeking. In retrospect it is a little disappointing that nobody
took the trouble to look for a better story. It may be more helpful to
think of a winning strategy for \(\exists\) in \(G(\phi)\) as a kind
of proof (in a suitable infinitary system) that \(\phi\) is true.</p>

<p>
Later Jaakko Hintikka extended the ideas of this section in two
directions, namely to natural language semantics and to games of
imperfect information (see the next section). The name
<em>Game-Theoretic Semantics</em>, GTS for short, has come to be used
to cover both of these extensions.</p>

<p>
The games described in this section adapt almost trivially to
many-sorted logic: for example the quantifier \(\forall x_{\sigma}\),
where \(x_{\sigma}\) is a variable of sort \(\sigma\), is an
instruction for player \(\forall\) to choose an element of sort
\(\sigma\). This immediately gives us the corresponding games for
second-order logic, if we think of the elements of a structure as one
sort, the sets of elements as a second sort, the binary relations as a
third and so on. It follows that we have, quite routinely, game rules
for most generalised quantifiers too; we can find them by first
translating the generalised quantifiers into second-order logic.</p>

<h2><a name="SemGamIF">4. Semantic Games with Imperfect Information</a></h2>

<p>
In this and the next section we look at some adaptations of the
semantic games of the previous section to other logics. In our first
example, the logic (the independence-friendly logic of Hintikka and
Sandu 1997, or more briefly IF logic) was created in order to fit the
game. See the entry on
 <a href="../logic-if/index.html" target="other">independence friendly logic</a>
 and Mann, Sandu and Sevenster 2011 for fuller accounts of this
logic.</p>

<p>
The games here are the same as in the previous section, except that we
drop the assumption that each player knows the previous history of the
play. For example we can require a player to make a choice without
knowing what choices the other player has made at certain earlier
moves. The classical way to handle this within game theory is to make
restrictions on the strategies of the players. For example we can
require that the strategy function telling \(\exists\) what to do at a
particular step is a function whose domain is the family of possible
choices of \(\forall\) at just his first and second moves; this is a
way of expressing that \(\exists\) doesn&rsquo;t know how \(\forall\)
chose at his third and later moves. Games with restrictions of this
kind on the strategy functions are said to be of <em>imperfect
information</em>, as opposed to the games of <em>perfect
information</em> in the previous section.</p>

<p>
To make a logic that fits these games, we use the same first-order
language as in the previous section, except that a notation is added
to some quantifiers (and possibly also some connectives), to show that
the Skolem functions for these quantifiers (or connectives) are
independent of certain variables. For example the sentence </p>

\[
(\forall x)(\exists y/ \forall x)R(x, y)
\]

<p>
is read as: &ldquo;For every \(x\) there is \(y\), not depending on
\(x\), such that \(R(x, y)\)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
There are three important comments to make on the distinction between
perfect and imperfect information. The first is that the Gale-Stewart
theorem holds only for games of perfect information. Suppose for
example that \(\forall\) and \(\exists\) play the following game.
First, \(\forall\) chooses one of the numbers 0 and 1. Then
\(\exists\) chooses one of these two numbers. Player \(\exists\) wins
if the two numbers chosen are the same, and otherwise player
\(\forall\) wins. We require that \(\exists\), when she makes her
choice, doesn&rsquo;t know what \(\forall\) chose; so a Skolem
function for her will be a constant. (This game corresponds to the IF
sentence above with \(R\) read as equality, in a structure with a
domain consisting of 0 and 1.) It&rsquo;s clear that player
\(\exists\) doesn&rsquo;t have a constant winning strategy, and also
that player \(\forall\) doesn&rsquo;t have a winning strategy at all.
So this game is undetermined, although its length is only 2.</p>

<p>
One corollary is that Hintikka&rsquo;s justification for reading
negation as dualising (&lsquo;players swap places&rsquo;), in his
games for first-order logic, doesn&rsquo;t carry over to IF logic.
Hintikka&rsquo;s response has been that dualising was the correct
intuitive meaning of negation even in the first-order case, so no
justification is needed. </p>

<p>
The second comment is that already in games of perfect information, it
can happen that winning strategies don&rsquo;t use all the available
information. For example in a game of perfect information, if player
\(\exists\) has a winning strategy, then she also has a winning
strategy where the strategy functions depend only on the previous
choices of \(\forall\). This is because she can reconstruct her own
previous moves using her earlier strategy functions.</p>

<p>
When Hintikka used Skolem functions as strategies in his games for
first-order logic, he made the strategies for a player depend only on
the previous moves of the other player. (A Skolem function for
\(\exists\) depends only on universally quantified variables.) Because
the games were games of perfect information, there was no loss in
this, by the second comment above. But when he moved to IF logic, the
requirement that strategies depend only on moves of the other player
really did make a difference. Hodges 1997 showed this by revising the
notation, so that for example \((\exists y/x)\) means: &ldquo;There is
\(y\) independent of \(x\), regardless of which player chose
\(x\)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Consider now the sentence </p> 

\[
(\forall x)(\exists z)(\exists y/x)(x=y), 
\]

<p>
played again on a structure with two elements 0 and 1. Player
\(\exists\) can win as follows. For \(z\) she chooses the same as
player \(\forall\) chose for \(x\); then for \(y\) she chooses the
same as she chose for \(z\). This winning strategy works only because
in this game \(\exists\) can refer back to her own previous choices.
She would have no winning strategy if the third quantifier was
\((\exists y/xz)\), again because any Skolem function for this
quantifier would have to be constant. The way that \(\exists\) passes
information to herself by referring to her previous choice is an
example of the phenomenon of <em>signalling</em>. John von Neumann and
Oskar Morgenstern illustrated it with the example of Bridge, where a
single player consists of two partners who have to share information
by using their public moves to signal to each other.</p>

<p>
The third comment is that there is a dislocation between the intuitive
idea of imperfect information and the game-theoretic definition of it
in terms of strategies. Intuitively, imperfect information is a fact
about the circumstances in which the game is played, not about the
strategies. This is a very tricky matter, and it continues to lead to
misunderstandings about IF and similar logics. Take for example the
sentence </p> 

\[
(\exists x)(\exists y/ x)(x=y),
\]

<p>
again played on a structure with elements 0 and 1. Intuitively one
might think that if \(\exists\) isn&rsquo;t allowed to remember at the
second quantifier what she chose at the first, then she can hardly
have a winning strategy. But in fact she has a very easy one:
&lsquo;Always choose 0&rsquo;!</p>

<p>
Compared with first-order logic, IF logic is missing a component that
the game semantics won&rsquo;t supply. The game semantics tells us
when a sentence is true in a structure. But if we take a formula with
\(n\) free variables, what does the formula express about the ordered
\(n\)-tuples of elements of the structure? In first-order logic it
would define a set of them, i.e. an \(n\)-ary relation on the
structure; the Tarski truth definition explains how. Is there a
similar definition for arbitrary formulas of IF logic? It turns out
that there is one for the slightly different logic introduced by
Hodges 1997, and it leads to a Tarski-style truth definition for the
language of that logic. With a little adjustment this truth definition
can be made to fit IF logic too. But for both of these new logics
there is a catch: instead of saying when an assignment of elements to
free variables makes a formula true, we say when a <em>set</em> of
assignments of elements to free variables makes the formula true.
V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen 2007 made this idea the basis for a range of
new logics for studying the notion of dependence (see entry on
 <a href="../logic-dependence/index.html">dependence logic</a>).
 In these logics the semantics is defined without games, although the
original inspiration comes from the work of Hintikka and Sandu. </p>

<p>
In V&auml;&auml;n&auml;nen&rsquo;s logics it is easy to see why one
needs sets of assignments. He has an atomic formula expressing
&lsquo;\(x\) is dependent on \(y\)&rsquo;. How can we interpret this
in a structure, for example the structure of natural numbers? It makes
no sense at all to ask for example whether 8 is dependent on 37. But
if we have a set X of ordered pairs of natural numbers, it does make
sense to ask whether in X the first member of each pair is dependent
on the second; the answer Yes would mean that there is a function
\(f\) such that each pair \((a,b)\) in X has the form \((f(b),b)\).
</p>

<h2><a name="MoreSemGam">5. Semantic Games for Other Logics</a></h2>

<p>
Structures of the following kind give rise to interesting games. The
structure \(A\) consists of a set \(S\) of elements (which we shall
call <em>states</em>, adding that they are often called
<em>worlds</em>), a binary relation \(R\) on \(S\) (we shall read
\(R\) as <em>arrow</em>), and a family \(P_1 ,\ldots ,P_n\) of subsets
of \(S\). The two players \(\forall\) and \(\exists\) play a game G on
\(A\), starting at a state \(s\) which is given them, by reading a
suitable logical formula \(\phi\) as a set of instructions for playing
and for winning. </p>

<p>
Thus if \(\phi\) is \(P_i\), then player \(\exists\) wins at once if
\(s\) is in \(P_i\), and otherwise player \(\forall\) wins at once.
The formulas \(\psi \wedge \theta , \psi \vee \theta\) and \(\neg
\psi\) behave as in Hintikka&rsquo;s games above; for example \(\psi
\wedge \theta\) instructs player \(\forall\) to choose whether the
game shall continue as for \(\psi\) or for \(\theta\). If the formula
\(\phi\) is \(\Box \psi\), then player \(\forall\) chooses an arrow
from \(s\) to a state \(t\) (i.e. a state \(t\) such that the pair
\((s, t)\) is in the relation \(R)\), and the game then proceeds from
the state \(t\) according to the instructions \(\psi\). The rule for
\(\Diamond \psi\) is the same except that player \(\exists\) makes the
choice. Finally we say that the formula \(\phi\) is <em>true at s in
A</em> if player \(\exists\) has a winning strategy for this game
based on \(\phi\) and starting at \(s\).</p>

<p>
These games stand to modal logic in very much the same way as
Hintikka&rsquo;s games stand to first-order logic. In particular they
are one way of giving a semantics for modal logic, and they agree with
the usual Kripke-type semantics. Of course there are many types and
generalisations of modal logic (including closely related logics such
as temporal, epistemic and dynamic logics), and so the corresponding
games come in many different forms. One example of interest is the
computer-theoretic logic of Matthew Hennessy and Robin Milner, used
for describing the behaviour of systems; here the arrows come in more
than one colour, and moving along an arrow of a particular colour
represents performing a particular &lsquo;action&rsquo; to change the
state. Another example is the more powerful modal \(\mu\)-calculus of
Dexter Kozen, which has fixed point operators; see Chapter 5 of
Stirling 2001.</p>

<p>
One interesting feature of these games is that if a player has a
winning strategy from some position onwards, then that strategy never
needs to refer to anything that happened earlier in the play.
It&rsquo;s irrelevant what choices were made earlier, or even how many
steps have been played. So we have what the computer scientists
sometimes call a &lsquo;memoryless&rsquo; winning strategy. </p>

<p>
In the related &lsquo;logic of games&rsquo;, proposed by Rohit Parikh,
games that move us between the states are the subject matter rather
than a way of giving a truth definition. These games have many
interesting aspects. In 2003 the journal <em>Studia Logica</em> ran an
issue devoted to them, edited by Marc Pauly and Parikh.</p>

<p>
Influences from economics and computer science have led a number of
logicians to use logic for analysing decision making under conditions
of partial ignorance. (See for example the article on
 <a href="../logic-epistemic/index.html" target="other">epistemic logic</a>.)
 There are several ways to represent states of knowledge. One is to
take them as states or worlds in the kind of modal structure that we
mentioned at the beginning of this section. Another is to use IF logic
or a variant of it. How are these approaches related? Johan van
Benthem 2006 presents some thoughts and results on this very natural
question. See also the papers by Johan van Benthem, Krister Segerberg,
Eric Pacuit and K. Venkatesh and their references, in Part IV
&lsquo;Logic, Agency and Games&rsquo; of Van Benthem, Gupta and Parikh
2011 and the entry on
 <a href="../logics-for-games/index.html">logics for analyzing games</a>
 for a sample of recent work in this area.</p>

<h2><a name="BacForGam">6. Back-and-Forth Games</a></h2>

<p>
In 1930 Alfred Tarski formulated the notion of two structures \(A\)
and \(B\) being <em>elementarily equivalent</em>, i.e., that exactly
the same first-order sentences are true in \(A\) as are true in \(B\).
At a conference in Princeton in 1946 he described this notion and
expressed the hope that it would be possible to develop a theory of it
that would be &lsquo;as deep as the notions of isomorphism, etc. now
in use&rsquo; (Tarski 1946). </p>

<p>
One natural part of such a theory would be a purely structural
necessary and sufficient condition for two structures to be
elementarily equivalent. Roland Fra&iuml;ss&eacute;, a
French-Algerian, was the first to find a usable necessary and
sufficient condition. It was rediscovered a few years later by the
Kazakh logician A. D. Taimanov, and it was reformulated in terms of
games by the Polish logician Andrzej Ehrenfeucht. The games are now
known as <em>Ehrenfeucht-Fra&iuml;ss&eacute;</em> games, or sometimes
as <em>back-and-forth</em> games. They have turned out to be one of
the most versatile ideas in twentieth-century logic. They adapt
fruitfully to a wide range of logics and structures.</p>

<p>
In a back-and-forth game there are two structures \(A\) and \(B\), and
two players who are commonly called Spoiler and Duplicator. (The names
are due to Joel Spencer in the early 1990s. More recently Neil
Immerman suggested Samson and Delilah, using the same initials; this
places Spoiler as the male player \(\forall\) and Duplicator as the
female \(\exists\).) Each step in the game consists of a move of
Spoiler, followed by a move of Duplicator. Spoiler chooses an element
of one of the two structures, and Duplicator must then choose an
element of the other structure. So after \(n\) steps, two sequences
have been chosen, one from \(A\) and one from \(B\):</p> 

\[
(a_0 ,\ldots ,a_{n-1} ; b_0,\ldots ,b_{n-1}).
\]

<p>
This position is a win for Spoiler if and only if some atomic formula
(of one of the forms &lsquo;\(\R(v_0 ,\ldots ,v_{k-1})\)&rsquo; or
&lsquo;\(\mathrm{F}(v_0 ,\ldots ,v_{k-1}) = v_k\)&rsquo; or
&lsquo;\(v_0 =v_1\)&rsquo;, or one of these with different variables)
is satisfied by \((a_0 ,\ldots ,a_{n-1})\) in \(A\) but not by \((b_0
,\ldots ,b_{n-1})\) in \(B\), or vice versa. The condition for
Duplicator to win is different in different forms of the game. In the
simplest form, \(\EF(A, B)\), a play is a win for Duplicator if and
only if no initial part of it is a win for Spoiler (i.e. she wins if
she hasn&rsquo;t lost by any finite stage). For each natural number
\(m\) there is a game \(\EF_m (A, B)\); in this game Duplicator wins
after \(m\) steps provided she has not yet lost. All these games are
determined, by the Gale-Stewart Theorem. The two structures \(A\) and
\(B\) are said to be <em>back-and-forth equivalent</em> if Duplicator
has a winning strategy for \(\EF(A, B)\), and <em>m-equivalent</em> if
she has a winning strategy for \(\EF_m (A, B)\).</p>

<p>
One can prove that if \(A\) and \(B\) are \(m\)-equivalent for every
natural number \(m\), then they are elementarily equivalent. In fact,
if Eloise has a winning strategy \(\tau\) in the Hintikka game
G\((\phi)\) on \(A\), where the nesting of quantifier scopes of
\(\phi\) has at most m levels and Duplicator has a winning strategy
\(\varrho\) in the game \(\EF_m (A, B)\), the two strategies \(\tau\)
and \(\varrho\) can be composed into a winning strategy of Eloise in
G\((\phi)\) on \(B\). On the other hand a winning strategy for Spoiler
in \(\EF_m (A, B)\) can be converted into a first-order sentence that
is true in exactly one of \(A\) and \(B\), and in which the nesting of
quantifier scopes has at most \(m\) levels. So we have our necessary
and sufficient condition for elementary equivalence, and a bit more
besides.</p>

<p>
If \(A\) and \(B\) are back-and-forth equivalent, then certainly they
are elementarily equivalent; but in fact back-and-forth equivalence
turns out to be the same as elementary equivalence in an
 <a href="../logic-infinitary/index.html">infinitary logic</a>
 which is much more expressive than first-order logic. There are many
adjustments of the game that give other kinds of equivalence. For
example Barwise, Immerman and Bruno Poizat independently described a
game in which the two players have exactly \(p\) numbered pebbles
each; each player has to label his or her choices with a pebble, and
the two choices in the same step must be labelled with pebbles
carrying the same number. As the game proceeds, the players will run
out of pebbles and so they will have to re-use pebbles that were
already used. The condition for Spoiler to win at a position (and all
subsequent positions) is the same as before, except that only the
elements carrying labels at that position count. The existence of a
winning strategy for Duplicator in this game means that the two
structures agree for sentences which use at most \(p\) variables
(allowing these variables to occur any number of times).</p>

<p>
The theory behind back-and-forth games uses very few assumptions about
the logic in question. As a result, these games are one of the few
model-theoretic techniques that apply as well to finite structures as
they do to infinite ones, and this makes them one of the cornerstones
of theoretical computer science. One can use them to measure the
expressive strength of formal languages, for example database query
languages. A typical result might say, for example, that a certain
language can&rsquo;t distinguish between &lsquo;even&rsquo; and
&lsquo;odd&rsquo;; we would prove this by finding, for each level
\(n\) of complexity of formulas of the language, a pair of finite
structures for which Duplicator has a winning strategy in the
back-and-forth game of level \(n\), but one of the structures has an
even number of elements and the other has an odd number. Semanticists
of natural languages have found back-and-forth games useful for
comparing the expressive powers of
 <a href="../generalized-quantifiers/index.html">generalised quantifiers</a>.
 (See for example Peters and Westerst&aring;hl 2006 Section IV.)</p>

<p>
There is also a kind of back-and-forth game that corresponds to our
modal semantics above in the same way as
Ehrenfeucht-Fra&iuml;ss&eacute; games correspond to Hintikka&rsquo;s
game semantics for first-order logic. The players start with a state
\(s\) in the structure \(A\) and a state \(t\) in the structure \(B\).
Spoiler and Duplicator move alternately, as before. Each time he
moves, Spoiler chooses whether to move in \(A\) or in \(B\), and then
Duplicator must move in the other structure. A move is always made by
going forwards along an arrow from the current state. If between them
the two players have just moved to a state \(s\)&acute; in \(A\) and a
state \(t\)&acute; in \(B\), and some predicate \(P_i\) holds at just
one of \(s\)&acute; and \(t\)&acute;, then Duplicator loses at once.
Also she loses if there are no available arrows for her to move along;
but if Spoiler finds there are no available arrows for him to move
along in either structure, then Duplicator wins. If the two players
play this game with given starting states \(s\) in \(A\) and \(t\) in
\(B\), and both structures have just finitely many states, then one
can show that Duplicator has a winning strategy if and only if the
same modal sentences are true at \(s\) in \(A\) as are true at \(t\)
in \(B\).</p>

<p>
There are many generalisations of this result, some of them involving
the following notion. Let \(Z\) be a binary relation which relates
states of \(A\) to states of \(B\). Then we call \(Z\) a
<em>bisimulation</em> between \(A\) and \(B\) if Duplicator can use
\(Z\) as a nondeterministic winning strategy in the back-and-forth
game between \(A\) and \(B\) where the first pair of moves of the two
players is to choose their starting states. In computer science the
notion of a bisimulation is crucial for the understanding of \(A\) and
\(B\) as systems; it expresses that the two systems interact with
their environment in the same way as each other, step for step. But a
little before the computer scientists introduced the notion,
essentially the same concept appeared in Johan van Benthem&rsquo;s PhD
thesis on the semantics of modal logic (1976).</p>

<h2><a name="OthModTheGam">7. Other Model-theoretic Games</a></h2>

<p>
The logical games in this section are mathematicians&rsquo; tools, but
they have some conceptually interesting features. </p>

<h3><a name="ForGam">7.1 Forcing games</a></h3>

<p>
Forcing games are also known to descriptive set theorists as
<em>Banach-Mazur games</em>; see the references by Kechris or Oxtoby
below for more details of the mathematical background. Model theorists
use them as a way of building infinite structures with controlled
properties. In the simplest case \(\forall\) and \(\exists\) play a
so-called Model Existence Game, where \(\exists\) claims that a fixed
sentence \(\phi\) has a model while \(\forall\) claims that he can
derive a contradiction from \(\phi\). In the beginning a countably
infinite set \(C\) of new constant symbols \(a_0, a_1, a_2\) etc is
fixed. \(\exists\) defends a disjunction by choosing one disjunct, and
an existential statement by choosing a constant from \(C\) as a
witness. \(\forall\) can challenge a conjunction by choosing either
conjunct, and a universal statement by choosing an arbitrary witness
from \(C\). \(\exists\) wins if no contradicting atomic sentences are
played. \(\exists\) has a winning strategy (a Consistency Property is
one way of describing a winning strategy) if and only if \(\phi\) has
a model. On the other hand, if \(\forall\) has a winning strategy, the
tree (which can be made finite) of all plays against his winning
strategy is related to a Gentzen style proof of the negation of
\(\phi\). This method of analysing sentences is closely related to
Beth&rsquo;s method of semantic tableaux and the Dialogical Game (see
Section 8).</p>

<p>
To sketch the idea of the general Forcing Game, imagine that a
countably infinite team of builders are building a house \(A\). Each
builder has his or her own task to carry out: for example to install a
bath or to wallpaper the entrance hall. Each builder has infinitely
many chances to enter the site and add some finite amount of material
to the house; these slots for the builders are interleaved so that the
whole process takes place in a sequence of steps counted by the
natural numbers. </p>

<p>
To show that the house can be built to order, we need to show that
each builder separately can carry out his or her appointed task,
regardless of what the other builders do. So we imagine each builder
as player \(\exists\) in a game where all the other players are lumped
together as \(\forall\), and we aim to prove that \(\exists\) has a
winning strategy for this game. When we have proved this for each
builder separately, we can imagine them going to work, each with their
own winning strategy. They all win their respective games and the
result is one beautiful house.</p>

<p>
More technically, the elements of the structure \(A\) are fixed in
advance, say as \(a_0, a_1, a_2\) etc., but the properties of these
elements have to be settled by the play. Each player moves by throwing
in a set of atomic or negated atomic statements about the elements,
subject only to the condition that the set consisting of all the
statements thrown in so far must be consistent with a fixed set of
axioms written down before the game. (So throwing in a negated atomic
sentence \(\neg \phi\) has the effect of preventing any player from
adding \(\phi\) at a later stage.) At the end of the joint play, the
set of atomic sentences thrown in has a canonical model, and this is
the structure \(A\); there are ways of ensuring that it is a model of
the fixed set of axioms. A possible property P of \(A\) is said to be
<em>enforceable</em> if a builder who is given the task of making P
true of \(A\) has a winning strategy. A central point (due essentially
to Ehrenfeucht) is that the conjunction of a countably infinite set of
enforceable properties is again enforceable.</p>

<p>
Various L&ouml;wenheim-Skolem Theorems of model theory can be proved
using variants of the Forcing Game. In these variants we do not
construct a model but a submodel of a given model. We start with a big
model \(M\) for a sentence (or a countable set of sentences) \(\phi\).
Then we list the subformulas of \(\phi\) and each player has a
subformula with a free variable to attend to. The player&rsquo;s task
is to make sure that as soon as the parameters of the subformula occur
in the game, and there is a witness to the truth of the formula in the
big model, one such a witness is played. When the game is over, a
countable submodel of \(M\) has been built in such a way that it
satisfies \(\phi\).</p>

<p>
The name &lsquo;forcing&rsquo; comes from an application of related
ideas by Paul Cohen to construct models of set theory in the early
1960s. Abraham Robinson adapted it to make a general method for
building countable structures, and Martin Ziegler introduced the game
setting. Later Robin Hirsch and Ian Hodkinson used related games to
settle some old questions about relation algebras.</p>

<p>
Forcing games are a healthy example to bear in mind when thinking
about the Dawkins question. They remind us that in logical games it
need not be helpful to think of the players as opposing each
other.</p>

<h3><a name="CutChoGam">7.2 Cut-and-choose games</a></h3>

<p>
In the traditional cut-and-choose game you take a piece of cake and
cut it into two smaller pieces; then I choose one of the pieces and
eat it, leaving the other one for you. This procedure is supposed to
put pressure on you to cut the cake fairly. Mathematicians, not quite
understanding the purpose of the exercise, insist on iterating it.
Thus I make you cut the piece I chose into two, then I choose one of
those two; then you cut this piece again, and so on indefinitely. Some
even more unworldly mathematicians make you cut the cake into
countably many pieces instead of two. </p>

<p>
These games are important in the theory of definitions. Suppose we
have a collection \(A\) of objects and a family \(S\) of properties;
each property cuts \(A\) into the set of those objects that have the
property and the set of those that don&rsquo;t. Let \(\exists\) cut,
starting with the whole set \(A\) and using a property in \(S\) as a
knife; let \(\forall\) choose one of the pieces (which are subsets of
\(A)\) and give it back to \(\exists\) to cut again, once more using a
property in \(S\); and so on. Let \(\exists\) lose as soon as
\(\forall\) chooses an empty piece. We say that \((A, S)\) has
<em>rank</em> at most \(m\) if \(\forall\) has a strategy which
ensures that \(\exists\) will lose before her \(m\)-th move. The rank
of \((A, S)\) gives valuable information about the family of subsets
of \(A\) definable by properties in \(S\).</p>

<p>
Variations of this game, allowing a piece to be cut into infinitely
many smaller pieces, are fundamental in the branch of model theory
called <em>stability theory</em>. Broadly speaking, a theory is
&lsquo;good&rsquo; in the sense of stability theory if, whenever we
take a model \(A\) of the theory and \(S\) the set of first-order
formulas in one free variable with parameters from \(A\), the
structure \((A, S)\) has &lsquo;small&rsquo; rank. A different
variation is to require that at each step, \(\exists\) divides into
two each of the pieces that have survived from earlier steps, and
again she loses as soon as one of the cut fragments is empty. (In this
version \(\forall\) is redundant.) With this variation, the rank of
\((A\),S) is called its <em>Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension</em>; this
notion is used in computational learning theory.</p>

<h3><a name="GamTreTwoSucFun">7.3 Games on the tree of two successor functions</a></h3>

<p>
Imagine a tree that has been built up in levels. At the bottom level
there is a single root node, but a left branch and a right branch come
up from it. At the next level up there are two nodes, one on each
branch, and from each of these nodes a left branch and a right branch
grow up. So on the next level up there are four nodes, and again the
tree branches into left and right at each of these nodes. Continued to
infinity, this tree is called the <em>tree of two successor
functions</em> (namely left successor and right successor). Taking the
nodes as elements and introducing two function symbols for left and
right successor, we have a structure. A powerful theorem of Michael
Rabin states that there is an algorithm which will tell us, for every
monadic second-order sentence \(\phi\) in the language appropriate for
this structure, whether or not \(\phi\) is true in the structure.
(&rsquo;Monadic second-order&rsquo; means that the logic is like
first-order, except that we can also quantify over sets of
elements&mdash;but not over binary relations on elements, for
example.)</p>

<p>
Rabin&rsquo;s theorem has any number of useful consequences. For
example Dov Gabbay used it to prove the decidability of some modal
logics. But Rabin&rsquo;s proof, using automata, was notoriously
difficult to follow. Yuri Gurevich and Leo Harrington, and
independently Andrei Muchnik, found much simpler proofs in which the
automaton is a player in a game.</p>

<p>
This result of Rabin is one of several influential resuls that connect
games with automata. Another example is the <em>parity games</em>
which are used for verifying properties of modal systems. See for
example Stirling (2001) Chapter 6; Bradfield and Stirling (2006)
discuss parity games for the modal \(\mu\)-calculus. </p>

<h2><a name="GamDiaComPro">8. Games of dialogue, communication and proof</a></h2>

<p>
Several medieval texts describe a form of debate called
<em>obligationes</em>. There were two disputants, Opponens and
Respondens. At the beginning of a session, the disputants would agree
on a &lsquo;positum&rsquo;, typically a false statement. The job of
Respondens was to give rational answers to questions from Opponens,
assuming the truth of the positum; above all he had to avoid
contradicting himself unnecessarily. The job of Opponens was to try to
force Respondens into contradictions. So we broadly know the answer to
the Dawkins question, but we don&rsquo;t know the game rules! The
medieval textbooks do describe several rules that the disputants
should follow. But these rules are not stipulated rules of the game;
they are guidelines which the textbooks derive from principles of
sound reasoning with the aid of examples. (Paul of Venice justifies
one rule by the practice of &lsquo;great logicians, philosophers,
geometers and theologians&rsquo;.) In particular it was open to a
teacher of obligationes to discover new rules. This open-endedness
implies that obligationes are not logical games in our sense.</p>

<p>
Not everybody agrees with the previous sentence. For example Catarina
Dutilh Novaes (2007, 6) makes a detailed defence of the view that
obligationes present &ldquo;a remarkable case of conceptual similarity
between a medieval and a modern theoretical framework&rdquo;. But
whatever view we take on this question, these debates have inspired
one important line of modern research in logical games.</p>

<p>
Imagine \(\exists\) taking an oral examination in proof theory. The
examiner gives her a sentence and invites her to start proving it. If
the sentence has the form</p> 

\[
\phi \vee \psi
\]

<p>
then she is entitled to choose one of the sentences and say &lsquo;OK,
I&rsquo;ll prove this one&rsquo;. (In fact if the examiner is an
intuitionist, he may insist that she choose one of the sentences to
prove.) On the other hand if the sentence is</p> 

\[
\phi \wedge \psi
\]

<p>
then the examiner, being an examiner, might well choose one of the
conjuncts himself and invite her to prove that one. If she knows how
to prove the conjunction then she certainly knows how to prove the
conjunct.</p>

<p>
The case of \(\phi \rightarrow \psi\) is a little subtler. She will
probably want to start by assuming \(\phi\) in order to deduce
\(\psi\); but there is some risk of confusion because the sentences
that she has written down so far are all of them things to be proved,
and \(\phi\) is not a thing to be proved. The examiner can help her by
saying &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll assume \(\phi\), and let&rsquo;s see if you
can get to \(\psi\) from there&rsquo;. At this point there is a chance
that she sees a way of getting to \(\psi\) by deducing a contradiction
from \(\phi\); so she may turn the tables on the examiner and invite
him to show that his assumption is consistent, with a view to proving
that it isn&rsquo;t. The symmetry is not perfect: he was asking her to
show that a sentence is true everywhere, while she is inviting him to
show that a sentence is true somewhere. Nevertheless we can see a sort
of duality.</p>

<p>
Ideas of this kind lie behind the dialectical games of Paul Lorenzen.
He showed that with a certain amount of pushing and shoving, one can
write rules for the game which have the property that \(\exists\) has
a winning strategy if and only if the sentence that she is presented
with at the beginning is a theorem of intuitionistic logic. In a
gesture towards medieval debates, he called \(\exists\) the Proponent
and the other player the Opponent. Almost as in the medieval
obligationes, the Opponent wins by driving the Proponent to a point
where the only moves available to her are blatant
self-contradictions.</p>

<p>
Lorenzen claimed that his games provided justifications for both
intuitionist and classical logic (or in his words, made them
&lsquo;gerechtfertigt&rsquo;, Lorenzen (1961,196)). Unfortunately any
&lsquo;justification&rsquo; involves a convincing answer to the
Dawkins question, and this Lorenzen never provided. For example he
spoke of moves as &lsquo;attacks&rsquo;, even when (like the
examiner&rsquo;s choice at \(\phi \wedge \psi\) above) they look more
like help than hostility. </p>

<p>
The entry
 <a href="../logic-dialogical/index.html" target="other">dialogical logic</a>
 gives a fuller account of Lorenzen&rsquo;s games and a number of more
recent variants. In its present form (January 2013) it sidesteps
Lorenzen&rsquo;s claims about justifying logics. Instead it describes
the games as providing semantics for the logics (a point that Lorenzen
would surely have agreed with), and adds that for understanding the
differences between logics it can be helpful to compare their
semantics. </p>

<p>
From this point of view, Lorenzen&rsquo;s games stand as an important
paradigm of what recent proof theorists have called <em>semantics of
proofs</em>. A semantics of proofs gives a &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; not
just to the notion of being provable, but to each separate step in a
proof. It answers the question &lsquo;What do we achieve by making
this particular move in the proof?&rsquo; During the 1990s a number of
workers at the logical end of computer science looked for games that
would stand to
 <a href="../logic-linear/index.html" target="other">linear logic</a>
 and some other proof systems in the same way as Lorenzen&rsquo;s
games stood to intuitionist logic. Andreas Blass, and then later
Samson Abramsky and colleagues, gave games that corresponded to parts
of linear logic, but at the time of writing we don&rsquo;t yet have a
perfect correspondence between game and logic. This example is
particularly interesting because the answer to the Dawkins question
should give an intuitive interpretation of the laws of linear logic, a
thing that this logic has badly needed. The games of Abramsky et al.
tell a story about two interacting systems. But while he began with
games in which the players politely take turns, Abramsky later allowed
the players to act &lsquo;in a distributed, asynchronous
fashion&rsquo;, taking notice of each other only when they choose to.
These games are no longer in the normal format of logical games, and
their real-life interpretation raises a host of new questions.</p>

<p>
Giorgi Japaridze has proposed a &lsquo;computability logic&rsquo; for
studying computation. Its syntax is first-order logic with some extra
items reminiscent of linear logic. Its semantics is in terms of
semantic games with some unusual features. For example it is not
always determined which player makes the next move. The notion of
strategy functions is no longer adequate for describing the players;
instead Japaridze describes ways of reading the second player (player
\(\exists\) in our notation) as a kind of computing machine. Further
information is on his website.</p>

<p>
Another group of games of the same general family as Lorenzen&rsquo;s
are the proof games of Pavel Pudlak 2000. Here the Opponent (called
Prover) is in the role of an attorney in a court of law, who knows
that the Proponent (called Adversary) is guilty of some offence.
Proponent will insist he is innocent, and is prepared to tell lies to
defend himself. Opponent&rsquo;s aim is to force Proponent to
contradict something that Proponent is on record as having said
earlier; but Opponent keeps the record and (as in the pebble games
above) he sometimes has to drop items from the record for lack of
space or memory. The important question is not whether Opponent has a
winning strategy (it&rsquo;s assumed from the outset that he has one),
but how much memory he needs for his record. These games are a useful
device for showing upper and lower bounds on the lengths of proofs in
various proof systems.</p>

<p>
Another kind of logical game that allows lies is Ulam&rsquo;s Game
with Lies. Here one player thinks of a number in some given range. The
second player&rsquo;s aim is to find out what that number is, by
asking the first player yes/no questions; but the first player is
allowed to tell some fixed number of lies in his answers. As in
Pudlak&rsquo;s games, there is certainly a winning strategy for the
second player, but the question is how hard this player has to work in
order to win. The measure this time is not space or memory but time:
how many questions does he have to ask? Cignoli et al. 2000 Chapter 5
relate this game to many-valued logic.</p>

<p>
To return for a moment to Lorenzen: he failed to distinguish between
different stances that a person might take in an argument: stating,
assuming, conceding, querying, attacking, committing oneself. Whether
it is really possible to define all these notions without presupposing
some logic is a moot point. But never mind that; a refinement of
Lorenzen&rsquo;s games along these lines could serve as an approach to
informal logic, and especially to the research that aims to
systematise the possible structures of sound informal argument. On
this front see Walton and Krabbe 1995. The papers in Bench-Capon and
Dunne 2007 are also relevant. </p>

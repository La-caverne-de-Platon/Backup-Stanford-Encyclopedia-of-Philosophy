<h2>Newton's Scholium on Time, Space, Place and Motion</h2>

<p>

Scholium to the Definitions in <em>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia
Mathematica</em>, Bk. 1 (1689); trans. Andrew Motte (1729), rev.
Florian Cajori, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1934. pp.
6-12.</p>

<p>

Hitherto I have laid down the definitions of such words as are less
known, and explained the sense in which I would have them to be
understood in the following discourse. I do not define time, space,
place, and motion, as being well known to all. Only I must observe,
that the common people conceive those quantities under no other notions
but from the relation they bear to sensible objects. And thence arise
certain prejudices, for the removing of which it will be convenient to
distinguish them into absolute and relative, true and apparent,
mathematical and common.</p>

<p>

 <a name="I">I.</a>
 Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself,
and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything
external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent,
and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or
unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion, which is
commonly used instead of true time; such as an hour, a day, a month, a
year.</p>

<p>

 <a name="II">II.</a>
 Absolute space, in its own nature, without
relation to anything external, remains always similar and
immovable. Relative space is some movable dimension or measure of the
absolute spaces; which our senses determine by its position to bodies;
and which is commonly taken for immovable space; such is the dimension
of a subterraneous, an aerial, or celestial space, determined by its
position in respect of the earth.  Absolute and relative space are the
same in figure and magnitude; but they do not remain always
numerically the same. For if the earth, for instance, moves, a space
of our air, which relatively and in respect of the earth remains
always the same, will at one time be one part of the absolute space
into which the air passes; at another time it will be another part of
the same, and so, absolutely understood, it will be continually
changed.</p>

<p>

 <a name="III">III.</a>
 Place is a part of space which a body takes up,
and is according to the space, either absolute or relative. I say, a
part of space; not the situation, nor the external surface of the
body. For the places of equal solids are always equal but their
surfaces, by reason of their dissimilar figures, are often
unequal. Positions properly have no quantity, nor are they so much the
places themselves, as the properties of places. The motion of the
whole is the same with the sum of the motions of the parts; that is,
the translation of the whole, out of its place, is the same thing with
the sum of the translations of the parts out of their places; and
therefore the place of the whole is the same as the sum of the places
as the parts, and for that reason, it is internal, and in the whole
body.</p>

<p>

 <a name="IV">IV.</a>
 Absolute motion is the translation of a body
from one absolute place into another; and relative motion, the
translation from one relative place into another. Thus in a ship under
sail, the relative place of a body is that part of the ship which the
body possesses; or that part of the cavity which the body fills, and
which therefore moves together with the ship: and relative rest is the
continuance of the body in the same part of the ship, or of its
cavity. But real, absolute rest, is the continuance of the body in the
same part of that immovable space, in which the ship itself, its
cavity, and all that it contains, is moved. Wherefore, if the earth is
really at rest, the body, which relatively rests in the ship, will
really and absolutely move with the same velocity which the ship has
on the earth. But if the earth also moves, the true and absolute
motion of the body will arise, partly from the true motion of the
earth, in immovable space, partly from the relative motion of the ship
on the earth; and if the body moves also relatively in the ship, its
true motion will arise, partly from the true motion of the earth, in
immovable space, and partly from the relative motions as well of the
ship on the earth, as of the body in the ship; and from these relative
motions will arise the relative motion of the body on the earth. As if
that part of the earth, where the ship is, was truly moved towards the
east, with a velocity of 10010 parts; which the ship itself, with a
fresh gale, and full sails, is carried towards the west, with a
velocity expressed by 10 of those parts; but a sailor walks in the
ship towards the east, with 1 part of the said velocity; then the
sailor will be moved truly in immovable space towards the east, with a
velocity of 10001 parts, and relatively on the earth towards the west,
with a velocity of 9 of those parts.</p>

<p>

 <a name="V">V.</a>
 Absolute time, in astronomy, is distinguished from
relative, by the equation or correction of the apparent time. For the
natural days are truly unequal, though they are commonly considered as
equal, and used for a measure of time; astronomers correct this
inequality that they may measure the celestial motions by a more
accurate time. It may be, that there is no such thing as an equable
motion, whereby time may be accurately measured. All motions may be
accelerated and retarded, but the flowing of absolute time is not
liable to any change. The duration or perseverance of the existence of
things remains the same, whether the motions are swift or slow, or
none at all: and therefore this duration ought to be distinguished
from what are only sensible measures thereof; and from which we deduce
it, by means of the astronomical equation. The necessity of this
equation, for determining the times of a phenomenon, is evinced as
well from the experiments of the pendulum clock, as by eclipses of the
satellites of Jupiter.</p>

<p>

 <a name="VI">VI.</a>
 As the order of the parts of time is immutable,
so also is the order of the parts of space. Suppose those parts to be
moved out of their places, and they will be moved (if the expression
may be allowed) out of themselves. For times and spaces are, as it
were, the places as well of themselves as of all other things. All
things are placed in time as to order of succession; and in space as
to order of situation.  It is from their essence or nature that they
are places; and that the primary places of things should be movable,
is absurd. These are therefore the absolute places; and translations
out of those places, are the only absolute motions.</p>

<p>

 <a name="VII">VII.</a>
 But because the parts of space cannot be seen,
or distinguished from one another by our senses, therefore in their
stead we use sensible measures of them. For from the positions and
distances of things from any body considered as immovable, we define
[definimus] all places; and then with respect to such places, we
estimate all motions, considering bodies as transferred from some of
those places into others. And so, instead of absolute places and
motions, we use relative ones; and that without any inconvenience in
common affairs; but in philosophical disquisitions, we ought to
abstract from our senses, and consider things themselves, distinct
from what are only sensible measures of them. For it may be that there
is no body really at rest, to which the places and motions of others
may be referred.</p>

<p>

 <a name="VIII">VIII.</a>
 But we may distinguish rest and motion,
absolute and relative, one from the other by their properties, causes,
and effects.  It is a property of rest, that bodies really at rest do
rest in respect to one another. And therefore as it is possible, that
in the remote regions of the fixed stars, or perhaps far beyond them,
there may be some body absolutely at rest; but impossible to know
[scire], from the position of bodies to one another in our regions,
whether any of these do keep the same position to that remote body; it
follows that absolute rest cannot be determined [definiri] from the
position of bodies in our regions.</p>

<p>

 <a name="IX">IX.</a>
 It is a property of motion, that the parts,
which retain given positions to their wholes, do partake of the
motions of those wholes.  For all the parts of revolving bodies
endeavor to recede from the axis of motion; and the impetus of bodies
moving forwards arises from the joint impetus of all the
parts. Therefore, if surrounding bodies are moved, those that are
relatively at rest within them will partake of their motion. Upon
which account, the true and absolute motion of a body cannot be
determined [definiri] by the translation of it from those which only
seem to rest; for the external bodies ought not only to appear at
rest, but to be really at rest. For otherwise, all included bodies
besides their translation from near the surrounding ones, partake
likewise of their true motions; and though that translation were not
made, they would not be really at rest, but only seem to be so. For
the surrounding bodies stand in the like relation to the surrounded as
the exterior part of a whole does to the interior, or as the shell
does to the kernel; but if the shell moves, the kernel will also move,
as being part of the whole, without any removal from near the
shell.</p>

<p>

 <a name="X">X.</a>
 A property, near akin to the preceding, is this,
that if a place is moved, whatever is placed therein moves along with
it; and therefore a body, which is moved from a place in motion,
partakes also of the motion of its place. Upon which account, all
motions, from places in motion, are no other than parts of entire and
absolute motions; and every entire motion is composed of the motion of
the body out of its first place, and the motion of this place out of
its place; and so on, until we come to some immovable place [locum
immotum], as in the before-mentioned example of the sailor. Wherefore,
entire and absolute motions can be no otherwise determined [definiri]
than by immovable places [loca immota]; and for that reason I did
before refer those absolute motions to immovable places [loca immota],
but relative one to movable places. Now no other places are immovable
[immota] but those that, from infinity to infinity, do all retain the
same given position one to another; and upon this account must ever
remain unmoved [immota]; and do thereby constitute immovable
[immobile] space.</p>

<p>

 <a name="XI">XI.</a>
 The causes by which true and relative motions
are distinguished, one from the other, are the forces impressed upon
bodies to generate motion. True motion is neither generated nor
altered, but by some force impressed upon the body moved; but relative
motion may be generated or altered without any force impressed upon
the body. For it is sufficient only to impress some force on other
bodies with which the former is compared, that by their giving way,
that relation may be changed, in which the relative rest or motion of
this other body did consist [consistit]. Again, true motion suffers
always some change from any force impressed upon the moving body; but
relative motion does not necessarily undergo any change by such
forces. For if the same forces are likewise impressed on those other
bodies, with which the comparison is made, that the relative position
may be preserved, then that condition will be preserved in which the
relative motion consists. And therefore any relative motion may be
changed when the true motion remains unaltered, and the relative may
be preserved when the true suffers some change. Thus, true motion by
no means consists [consistit] in such relations.</p>

<p>

 <a name="XII">XII.</a>
 The effects which distinguish absolute from
relative motion are, the forces of receding from the axis of circular
motion. For there are no such forces in a circular motion purely
relative, but in a true and absolute circular motion, they are greater
or less, according to the quantity of the motion. If a vessel, hung by
a long cord, is so often turned about that the cord is strongly
twisted, then filled with water, and held at rest together with the
water; thereupon, by the sudden action of another force, it is whirled
about the contrary way, and while the cord is untwisting itself, the
vessel continues for some time in this motion; the surface of the
water will at first be plain [plana], as before the vessel began to
move; but after that, the vessel, by gradually communicating its
motion to the water, will make it begin sensibly to revolve, and
recede by little and little from the middle, and ascent to the sides
of the vessel, forming itself into a concave figure (as I have
experienced), and the swifter the motion becomes, the higher will the
water rise, till at last, performing its revolutions in the same times
with the vessel, it becomes relatively at rest in it. This ascent of
the water shows [indicat] its endeavor to recede from the axis of its
motion; and the true and absolute circular motion of the water, which
is here directly contrary to the relative, becomes known [innotescit],
and may be measured [mensuratur] by this endeavor. At first, when the
relative motion of the water in the vessel was greatest, it produced
no endeavor to recede from the axis; the water showed no tendency to
the circumference, nor any ascent towards the sides of the vessel, but
remained of a plain [plana] surface, and therefore its true circular
motion had not yet begun. But afterwards, when the relative motion of
the water had decreased, the ascent thereof towards the sides of the
vessel proved [indicabat] its endeavor to recede from the axis; and
this endeavor showed [monstrabat] the real circular motion of the
water continually increasing, till it had acquired its greatest
quantity, when the water rested relatively in the vessel. And
therefore this endeavor does not depend upon any translation of the
water in respect of the ambient bodies, nor can true circular motion
be defined [defineri] by such translation. There is only one real
circular motion of any one revolving body, corresponding to only one
power of endeavoring to recede from its axis of motion, as its proper
and adequate effect; but relative motions, in one and the same body,
are innumerable, according to the various relations it bears to
external bodies, and like other relations, are altogether destitute of
any real effect, any otherwise than they may perhaps partake of that
one only true motion. And therefore in their system who suppose that
our heavens, revolving below the sphere of the fixed stars, carry the
planets along with them; the several parts of those heavens, and the
planets, which are indeed relatively at rest in their heavens, do yet
really move. For they change their position one to another (which
never happens to bodies truely at rest), and being carried together
with their heavens, partake of their motions, and as parts of
revolving wholes, endeavor to recede from the axis of their
motions.</p>

<p>

 <a name="XIII">XIII.</a>
 Wherefore relative quantities are not the
quantities themselves, whose names they bear, but those sensible
measures of them (either accurate or inaccurate), which are commonly
used instead of the measured quantities themselves. And if the meaning
of words is to be determined [definiendae] by their use, then by the
names time, space, place, and motion, their measures [mensurae
sensibilies] are properly to be understood; and the expression will be
unusual, and purely mathematical, if the measured quantities
themselves are meant. On this account, those violate the accuracy of
language, which ought to be kept precise, who interpret these words
for the measured quantities. Nor do those less defile the purity of
mathematical and philosophical truths, who confound real quantities
with their relations and sensible measures [vulgaribus mensuris].</p>

<p>

 <a name="XIV">XIV.</a>
 It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to
discover [cognoscere], and effectually to distinguish [actu
discriminare], the true motions of particular bodies from the
apparent; because the parts of that immovable space, in which those
motions are performed, do by no means come under the observation of
our senses [incurrent in sensus].  Yet the thing is not altogether
desperate; for we have some arguments to guide us, partly from the
apparent motions, which are the differences of the true motions;
partly from the forces, which are the causes and effects of the true
motions. For instance, if two globes, kept at a given distance one
from the other by means of a cord that connects them, were revolved
about their common centre of gravity, we might, from the tension of
the cord, discover the endeavor of the globes to recede from the axis
of their motion, and from thence we might compute the quantity of
their circular motions. And then if any equal forces should be
impressed at once on the alternate faces of the globes to augment or
diminish their circular motions, from the increase or decrease of the
tension of the cord, we might infer the increment or decrement of
their motions; and thence would be found on what faces those forces
ought to be impressed, that the motions of the globes might be most
augmented; that is, we might discover their hindmost faces, or those
which, in the circular motion, do follow. But the faces which follow
being known, and consequently the opposite ones that precede, we
should likewise know the determination of their motions.  And thus we
might find both the quantity and the determination of this circular
motion, even in an immense vacuum, where there was nothing external or
sensible with which the globes could be compared. But now, if in that
space some remote bodies were placed that kept always a given position
one to another, as the fixed stars do in our regions, we could not
indeed determine from the relative translation of the globes among
those bodies, whether the motion did belong to the globes or to the
bodies. But if we observed the cord, and found that its tension was
that very tension which the motions of the globes required, we might
conclude the motion to be in the globes, and the bodies to be at rest;
and then, lastly, from the translation of the globes among the bodies,
we should find the determination of their motions. But how we are to
obtain the true motions from their causes, effects, and apparent
differences, and the converse, shall be explained more at large in the
following treatise. For to this end it was that I composed it.</p>

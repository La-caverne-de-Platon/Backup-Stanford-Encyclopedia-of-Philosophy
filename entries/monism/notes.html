 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
It is perhaps more common
for the bundle theorist to claim reductionism about concrete objects
than to claim eliminativism (Hoffman and Rosenkrantz 1997: 26&ndash;7; Paul
2002: 579&ndash;80). But it would be at least consistent to accept (i) the
bundle theorist&rsquo;s property ontology and (ii) that bundles of
compresent properties are not fit to serve as concrete objects. This
would yield the sort of nihilism contemplated in the main text.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
For Frege, the external
phenomenon is conceptualized via a sortal term (e.g., via
&ldquo;copse&rdquo; or &ldquo;tree&rdquo;), which provides an
associated unit. See Alston and Bennett 1984 for some further
discussion.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
Thus Aristotle
(<em>Meta</em>. 998b22; see also <em>Post</em>. <em>Anal</em>. 92b14)
argues that if entity (or unity) were the highest type, there could be
no differentia:</p>
<p>

But it is not possible that there should be one genus of entities,
or that unity or entity should be such; for it is necessary, indeed,
that the differences of each genus both exist, and that each should be
one: but it is impossible either for the species to be predicated about
the proper differences of the genus, or for the genus to subsist,
independent of the species itself. Wherefore, if unity or entity be a
genus, neither will entity or unity constitute any difference.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
The lack of a natural
type/token distinction for abstracta may be connected to the idea that
abstracta do not exist in spacetime. Though see Lewis 1986 for
discussion of different ways to draw the abstract/concrete
distinction.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>  Thus Plato (1961: 744;)
Republic VI: 508e&ndash;509b) compares the form of the good to the
sun, concluding: </p>

<blockquote><p>
This reality, then, that gives their truth to the
objects of knowledge and the power of knowing to the knower, you must
say is the idea of good&hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>
 And then adding: </p>

<blockquote><p>
the
objects of knowledge not only receive from the presence of the good
there being known, but their very existence and essence is derived to
them from it, &hellip;</p></blockquote>

<p>
 In this vein, Stace (1955: 79) comments:</p>

<blockquote><p>
[Plato&rsquo;s] own Absolute, the world of Ideas, is a many in
one. It is many because it contains many Ideas. It is one because these
Ideas constitute a single organized system of Ideas under the final
unity of the Idea of the Good.</p></blockquote>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
Here classical mereology and atomism are assumed. Other conceptions of mereology will
generate different counts. On the nihilist extreme, the total number of
parts just is the number of atomic parts. Classical mereology without
atoms (&ldquo;gunk&rdquo;) will generate a minimum of continuum-many
parts but zero atomic parts. For further discussion of mereological
systems, see Simons 1987.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
See Broad (1925: 17&ndash;38) for
a partly related taxonomy. Broad distinguishes three forms of monism:
(i) <em>Differentiating-Attribute Monism</em>, which concerns the
number of <em>realms of substances</em> (e.g., whether there is only the
material realm); (ii) <em>Specific-Property Monism</em>, which concerns
the number of <em>kinds in a realm</em> (e.g., whether there is only one
kind of material substance); and (iii) <em>Substantival Monism</em>,
which concerns the number of <em>substances in a realm</em> (e.g.,
whether there is only one material substance token). Broad (1925: 33)
recommends a &ldquo;tentative acceptance of a form of Substantival
Monism,&rdquo; which is something like priority monism, explaining that
he has:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>granted that the typical material substances of ordinary life,
<em>viz</em>., human bodies, chairs, trees, etc., are only imperfectly
substantial, since they are transitory and incapable of existing in
isolation. And I have granted that the solar system, and still more the
whole material realm, can claim a higher degree of substantiality.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>


<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
I will not discuss genus
monism, substance monism, or property monism further here partly
because they raise almost entirely distinct sets of issues, and partly
because they are already covered elsewhere in this encyclopedia. See
the entries on categories (Thomasson 2013) and on dualism (Robinson
2011).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
These interpretations are
controversial. <em>Parmenides</em>: See Owen 1960 for a reading of
Parmenides as an existence monist, and Curd 1998 for a rival reading of
Parmenides as not a monist in any sense under current discussion.
<em>Melissus</em>: See Sedely 1999 for a reading of Melissus as an
existence monist. <em>Spinoza</em>: See J. Bennett 1984 and 1991 for a
reading of Spinoza as an existence monist, see Curley 1969 and 1991 for
a reading of Spinoza as more like a priority monist, and see Guigon
2012 for an intermediary speaking to this very issue. <em>Bradley</em>:
Bradley (1994: 138) explicitly speaks of plurality as &ldquo;an
integral aspect in a substantial unity,&rdquo; and (1994: 141) says
that the One &ldquo;embraces every partial diversity in concord,&rdquo;
summarizing (1994: 178): &ldquo;The Reality, therefore, must be One,
not as excluding diversity, but as somehow including it in such a way
as to transform its character.&rdquo; But it is not obvious how to
interpret Bradley&rsquo;s talk about &ldquo;aspects&rdquo; and
&ldquo;diversity.&rdquo; Indeed, given Bradley&rsquo;s background
skepticism as to our grasp of the positive nature of Reality, he might
best be described as a monist who is skeptical of deciding between
existence and priority monism. See Candlish and Basile 2013 (espec.
&sect;6) for further discussion.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>  J. Bennett (1984:
103&ndash;6) evinces sympathy for the existence monism (&lsquo;field
metaphysic&rsquo;) he attributes to Spinoza, so perhaps should be
counted here as well. Della Rocca (2008: 46&ndash;58) likewise is
sympathetic to a Spinozan metaphysics of one substance with many
modes. Though he (2014: 291&ndash;2) endorses a Brtadleyan argument against
relations and says that this may require some &ldquo;view that goes
beyond pluralism and beyond monism,&rdquo; since: &ldquo;[O]nce
relations are out of the picture not only may we have to give up any
multiplicity of things, but we may not even be able to rest with even
one thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Rea (2001: 129) provides a defense of &ldquo;Eleatic monism,&rdquo;
understood as including the claim that &ldquo;There exists exactly one
material thing.&rdquo; But Rea&rsquo;s (2001: 147) proposal for reconciling
Eleatic monism with experience is to hold that &ldquo;we are not
denizens of the material world.&rdquo; This makes his monism far more
restrictive than existence monism (perhaps it is best understood as
substance dualism plus <em>material existence monism</em>: monism
about the material objects as counted by tokens), and makes his claim
to represent the actual Eleatic view rather questionable. Further,
Rea&rsquo;s final conclusion (2001: 147) is merely that such a monism counts
as &ldquo;a coherent (even if counterintuitive, even if false)
metaphysic.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
Indeed, Horgan and
Potr&#269; (2000: 50; 2008: 165) seem committed to spacetime and properties, in
describing the blobject as having &ldquo;enormous spatiotemporal
structural complexity, and enormous local variability.&rdquo; Thus
they say that &ldquo;the jello-world might occasionally exhibit quite
abrupt local spatial and temporal variations, in the degree to which
various magnitudes are locally instantiated.&rdquo; This looks to
require the existence of various locales and various magnitudes, in
addition to their one concretum. Though perhaps here they are merely
speaking indirectly (for further discussion see Tienson 2002 and Horgan and Potr&#269; 2008: 175&ndash;78).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
Thus Joad (1957: 428)
comments: &ldquo;During the last century Monistic Idealism
commanded a larger measure of agreement among philosophers than has
been accorded to any other philosophy since the Middle Ages.&rdquo; And
Blanshard (1973: 145) says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
With the appearance of the <em>Tractatus</em> in 1922, British
philosophy has completed a full circle in ten years. In 1912 has
appeared Bosanquet&rsquo;s <em>Principle of Individuality and
Value</em>, whose thesis was that the world was a single individual
whose parts are connected with each other by a necessity so intimate
and so organic that the nature of the part depended on its place in the
Absolute. A decade later found Wittgenstein maintaining that the
very opposite was the truth, that a full knowledge of the world,
instead of revealing it as a complete unity, would pulverize it into
atoms.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>  See Schaffer 2007 for
further discussion. There is a question of whether the existence
monist can establish systematic paraphrase techniques. See Sider 2008
(especially. 138&ndash;44) for a monistic construction of &ldquo;microworld
fictions&rdquo;, based on the idea of primitive statespace structure.
</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>

Presumably the existence
monist or nihilist who would bite the bullet would do so as part of a
general distrust of intuitions. This raises fundamental issues about
the methodology of metaphysics. It is troubling that intuitions in this
domain prove so unstable. Here one might recall Bosanquet&rsquo;s
(quoted in Muirhead 1935: 243) explanation of why he did not trouble to
give arguments for idealism: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it
important,&rdquo; since after all: &ldquo;the universe is <em>so
obviously</em> experience.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
The following argument
is adapted from Schaffer 2007. Perhaps something like this argument is
also behind Horgan and Potr&#269;&rsquo;s existence monism, which is
posited (2000: &sect;2.4) as the most parsimonious of the non-vague
ontologies. While Horgan and Potr&#269; do not actually give the exclusion
argument, presumably they also hold the sufficiency of their monistic
ontology, so that the gain in parsimony does not come at any
explanatory price. To that extent their motivations may be best
understood via the exclusion argument. (Horgan and Potr&#269;&rsquo;s argument from vagueness is
discussed below in &sect;2.2.3)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
In this vein, Albert
1996 argues that the most natural ontology of both Newtonian and
quantum mechanics is in terms of a single world-atom zipping through
configuration space.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
6 might also be defended
on ontological and/or epistemic grounds. The ontological defense of 6
would invoke the Eleatic Stranger&rsquo;s dictum from Plato&rsquo;s
<em>Sophist</em>, that to be is to have causal power. But this seems
implausible: epiphenomenal entities are surely conceivable, which is
good evidence that they are possible. The epistemic defense of 6 would
maintain that we have no good reason for believing in explanatorily
redundant and epiphenomenal entities. But this seems parasitic on
Occamite principles. For further discussion see the exchange between
Sider 2003 and Merricks 2003.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
The reader familiar with
the debate on mereological composition may note that this argument is
quite similar to the mereological nihilist&rsquo;s argument that only
the atomic parts exist (Merricks 2001: 56). The proper lesson is that
explanatory exclusion arguments can be used to argue <em>either</em>
against the parts <em>or</em> against the wholes. (These arguments are
best understood as arguments that we should not posit both). If
considerations of ontological economy are brought to bear, it seems
that the existence monist&rsquo;s version of the argument is
preferable. See Schaffer 2007 for further discussion.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
By &ldquo;the
world&rdquo; is meant only the whole concrete cosmos, and not any kind of
<em>trans-categorical sum</em> (e.g., the sum of all entities across all
categories). For further discussion of the latter see the exchange
between Simons 2003 and Varzi 2006.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
For instance, Hartle and
Hawking 1983 (in a classic paper entitled &ldquo;Wave function of the
Universe&rdquo;) attempt to write down the wave function of the world
(!) And here are some of the opening lines of the final chapter of a
standard college physics textbook (Young and Freedman 2004):
</p><blockquote><p>
Fundamental particles are the <em>smallest</em> things in the
universe, and cosmology deals with the <em>biggest</em> thing there
is&mdash;the universe itself.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-23">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
The view that
composition is identity is defended in Baxter 1988. See Lewis 1991,
Armstrong 1997, Sider 2006, and Bohn 2014 for further
discussion. <em>Caveat</em>: Lewis, Armstrong, and Sider all defend a
view labeled &ldquo;weak composition-as-identity,&rdquo; which is
really the view that composition is <em>not</em> identity, but merely
analogous to it in many respects. This weaker (and perhaps more
plausible) thesis will not support resistance to 2. As long as whole
and part are not identical, the question &ldquo;why posit both?&rdquo;
will arise.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
As Sider (2006: &sect;3)
points out, the &ldquo;set-like structure&rdquo; of pluralities is
crucial to the theoretical role of the plural quantifiers in standing
in for sets (e.g., in the definition of the ancestral relation),
interpreting second-order logic, and comparing the cardinalities of
pluralities too big to form sets.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
Relativization to a
target and a unit (as recommended for all numerical predication:
&sect;1) may undermine this argument. Perhaps the one copse/five trees
are both one relative to the unit &ldquo;copse&rdquo; but five relative
to &ldquo;tree.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>  This is the
conclusion of Schaffer 2007 (cf. Schaffer 2012: 87&ndash;89). There
Schaffer suggests that this modified version of Occam&rsquo;s Razor
(&ldquo;the Laser&rdquo;) supports priority monism, with its one basic
concretum. For further defense of the Laser see Schaffer 2015 and
Bennett 2017 (220&ndash;25), though for criticisms see Baron and Tallant
2018 and Fiddaman and Rodriguez-Pereyra 2018.

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>  Along these lines,
Descartes (1644 [1984]: 196) says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We should notice something very well known by the natural light:
nothingness possesses no attributes or qualities. It follows that,
whenever we find some attributes or qualities, there is necessarily
some thing or substance to be found for them to belong to; &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-28">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>
See Schaffer 2010a
(<em>app</em>.) and 2010b (&sect;1) for some further historical
discussion. Joad (1957: 420) characterizes the core monistic thesis as
the thesis that whole is prior to part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The wholes emphasized by monistic philosophers are, therefore,
logically prior to their parts. They are there, as it were, to begin
with, and being there, proceed to express themselves in parts whose
natures they pervade and determine.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-29">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>
One exception is
Schaffer 2010a, 2010b, <em>inter alia</em>. Another exception may be
Campbell (1990: 146), for whom the basic entities are <em>tropes</em>,
and the basic tropes are worldwide fields: &ldquo;All basic tropes are
space-filling fields, each one of them distributes some quantity,
perhaps in varying intensities, across all of space-time.&rdquo; So if
Campbell forms basic objects by compresent bundles of basic tropes (as
would be thematic for him), then he would be a priority monist. In this
vein, Campbell (1990: 154) concludes: &ldquo;We would reach
Spinoza&rsquo;s conclusion, that there is just one genuine substance,
the cosmos itself&hellip;&rdquo; Yet another exception may be Cameron
(2010b) who argues that the truthmaker theorist should take her
totality fact to be the one and only fundamental fact. This is clear a
monism of some sort (one fundamental fact) but it is not priority
monism as characterized, and gives no metaphysical pride of place to
the cosmos as a whole.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>  The conflation of
existence and priority monisms may have arisen with Russell. Thus
Russell (1918 [1985]: 36) sometimes treats his monistic opponents as
if they were existence monists who viewed &lsquo;parts&rsquo; as
merely: &ldquo;phases and unreal divisions of a single indivisible
Reality.&rdquo; But Russell sometimes treats the issue as one of
priority rather than existence, as in (1911 [2003]: 92): &ldquo;the
existence of the complex depends on the existence of the simple, and
not vica versa.&rdquo; In any case it is important to distinguish the
view that the world has no proper parts, from the view that the world
has dependent proper parts.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-31">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a>
Priority nihilism as
defined includes a variety of diverse views, including views that
things get ever more basic without limit (&ldquo;turtles all the way
down&rdquo;), as well as views on which basicness is a defective
notion.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-32">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-32">32.</a>
In Schaffer 2010a,
&ldquo;priority monism&rdquo; is formulated as per <em>Priority monism
(cosmic)</em>. This is perhaps terminologically unfortunate, since
there is room for interesting doctrines that uphold <em>Priority
monism</em> but deny <em>Priority monism (cosmic)</em> in virtue of
denying certain background mereological assumptions. For instance,
Guigon 2012 defends an interpretation of Spinoza as neither an
existence monist nor a priority monist. On Guigon&rsquo;s
interpretation, Spinoza is a fictionalist about mereology who holds
that there are many things (existence pluralist) and that there is one
basic thing, but would reject any mereological definition of the one
basic thing. In a partially related vein Kriegel 2012 defends a
&ldquo;Kantian monism&rdquo; which allies the idea of one basic thing
with a demotion of mereological notions to the status of
response-dependent notions.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-33">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-33">33.</a>
See Fine 2001 and 2012, Schaffer
2009a and 2016, Rosen 2010, and K. Bennett 2011 and 2017, for influential discussions of
grounding. Though for some skeptical reactions Hofweber 2009, Daly
2012, and Wilson 2014.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-34">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-34">34.</a>
Ontological
foundationalism is supported by the metaphysical intuition that being
requires an <em>ultimate ground</em>. Without ontologically basic
entities, being would be endlessly deferred, never achieved.</p>

<p>

In this vein, Fine (1991: 267) suggests as natural the following
ontological principle: </p>

<blockquote><p>
<em>Foundation</em>: Necessarily, any
element of the ontology can be constructed from the basic elements of
the ontology by means of constructors in the ontology.</p></blockquote>

<p>See Cameron 2008b, and the essays collected in Bliss and Priest 2018, for further discussion.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-35">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-35">35.</a>
Ontological
foundationalism (without concreta foundationalism) is thus compatible
with the following scenario: there is a sequence of priority relations
which is limitless amongst concreta, but which has a limit in a basic
entity of another ontological category. (Analogy: there is an infinite
sequence of extended regions nested inside any given region in a pointy
space. At the limit of this sequence are not extended regions but
points.) This is what concreta foundationalism excludes.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-36">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-36">36.</a>
Lewis&rsquo;s (1986: ix)
idea that what is fundamental is &ldquo;just one little thing and then
another&rdquo; thereby expresses a pluralist view. For the monist, the
entire cosmic scene is painted onto one vast unbroken slate.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-37">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-37">37.</a>  For instance, Schaffer 2009b
connects priority monism to the supersubstantivalist identification of
objects with regions of spacetime, and Schaffer 2010c argues that a
related &ldquo;one fundamental fact only&rdquo; monism helps with
truthmaking for negative existentials.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-38">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-38">38.</a>
Thus Aristotle (1987:
298) offers the following intuitive judgments on whether whole or part
is prior:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the parts are prior to the whole, and the acute angle is a part
of the right angle and the finger a part of the animal, the acute angle
will be prior to the right angle and the finger to the man. But the
latter are thought to be prior; for in formula the parts are explained
by reference to them, and in virtue also of the power of existing apart
from the parts the wholes are prior.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-39">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-39">39.</a>
Perhaps this explains
the historical affinity between monism and idealism. In this vein, Joad
(1957: 420) notes:</p>

<blockquote><p>
We entertain our ideas, we form our plans as
wholes&hellip; The wholes of monistic philosophy are in this respect
like mental wholes.</p></blockquote>

<p>
 Though of course the monist need not be an
idealist&mdash;the point is rather that the idealist is likely to be a
monist.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-40">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-40">40.</a>  Thus those who view
the cosmos as a functionally integrated whole are likely to side with
the priority monist. In this vein Marcus Aurelius (quoted in
Rutherford 1989: 57) proclaims:</p>

<blockquote><p>
All things are woven
together and the common bond is sacred,&hellip; for they have been
arranged together in their places and together make the same ordered
Universe. For there is one Universe out of all, one God through all,
one substance and one law.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

See Schaffer 2010a
&sect;2.1 for further discussion, including an argument that by the
lights of reflective common sense the decomposition of the cosmos into
portions is arbitrary. See O&rsquo;Conaill and Tahko 2012 for a
reply.</p>

Schaffer 2010, Morganti 2009, and Calosi 2014 and 2018 for
further relevant discussion. Also see Bohn (2012: 218) for a different
reply on behalf of the pluralist, which posits fundamental collective
properties of pluralities: </p>

<blockquote><p>
The pluralist should simply say of
the two particles that <em>they</em> have a quantum property <i>Q</i>. Having
<i>Q</i> is a <em>plural</em>, <em>collective</em> intrinsic property of the
<em>two</em> particles.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-44">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-44">44.</a>  This remains neutral
on whether metaphysical necessity should be understood as full-blown
necessity, or as a restriction imposed on a larger space (which would
include metaphysically impossible and perhaps even logically
impossible points: see Nolan 1997 for a view with this character).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-45">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-45">45.</a>
Though see Miller 2009
for an argument that the issue should be regarded as contingent. One

necessary but contingent with respect to some larger space that
includes metaphysically impossible points.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-46">46.</a>  For further
discussion on the possibility of gunk see Sider 1993, Zimmerman 1996,
Hudson 2001, and Schaffer 2003. For general discussions of the extent
of possibility see the volume edited by Gendler and Hawthorne
2002. Given a distinction between metaphysical possibility and a wider
notion of conceptual possibility, there is also room for the pluralist
to reply that gunk is conceptually possible but still not
metaphysically possible. It is not clear how to assess claims of
metaphysical possibility at this stage.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-47">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-47">47.</a>
Tallant
(2013) suggests that the possibility of both gunk as
well as junk suggests that the framework of priority needs
reconsideration. Saucedo (<em>manuscript</em>) defends a plural notion
of fundamentality, and argues that the plurality of all things is a
fundamental plurality, partly to accommodate both gunk and junk.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-48">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-48">48.</a>
Bohn (2012: 216)
provides a principle of finite fusion (any two things have a fusion),
which, when combined with infinite atoms, will generate junky models.
But no motivation for restriction composition to the finite case is
offered. Indeed Bohn (2014) advocates composition as identity
and argues that this entails unrestricted composition (which rules out junk).</p>

The argument from
heterogeneity equally arises against existence monism (&sect;2), and
the replies we consider are equally available for the existence
monist.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-50">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-50">50.</a>
Really this may be
just a bad pun on &lsquo;different.&rsquo; What is true is that nothing
can be non-identical to itself. What is false is that nothing can be
internally qualitatively diverse.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-51">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-51">51.</a>
The scenario of
heterogeneity all the way down is a gunky scenario (gunk being matter
every part of which has proper parts). If gunk is possible then it
seems that heterogeneity-all-the-way-down must be possible. For such
constitutes a consistent distribution of properties over gunk.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-52">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-52">52.</a>
This follows Parsons
(2004), who offers examples such as <em>being polka-dotted</em> and
<em>being hot at one end and cold at the other</em>, and invokes the
possibility of heterogeneity-all-the-way-down to argue against the
reductionist view that distributional properties derive from a
plurality of homogeneous parts.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-53">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-53">53.</a> This maneuver looks to
 freely quantify over a plurality of regions, and so (barring any
 further treatment of regions) requires existence pluralism for the
 target of regions.</p>

<div id="note-54">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-54">54.</a>
The idea of using
adverbials is lifted from adverbialist theories of perception, such as
Chisholm 1957. The adverbialist about perception replaces a plurality
of objects of experience (sense-data) by a single subject sensing in
different manners. So when I perceive red here and green there, the
adverbialist says that I am sensing-herely red and sensing-therely
green. Thus Burgess and Rosen (1997: 185&ndash;6; see also Johnston 1987, and
Hawthorne and Cortens 1995) explain, in skeptical tones:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nominalists are very moderate compared to monists, whose view is
summarized by Prior [as]: &lsquo;there is only a single genuine
individual (the Universe) which gets John-Smithish or Mary-Brownish in
such-and-such regions for such-and-such periods&rsquo;. (David
Lewis has pointed out that Prior really should say,
&lsquo;&hellip;regionally and periodically&rsquo;.) And Mary
Brown and John Smith don&rsquo;t do anything: the Universe does things
Mary-Brownishly and John-Smithishly.</p>

See Weatherson and
Marshall 2012 for a useful overview. As Weatherson and Marshall show,
there actually seem to be several distinct notions lumped under
&ldquo;intrinsic.&rdquo; So it may be possible for the priority monist
to give up on some of these notions as long as she preserves others and
shows these capable of doing the needed work. This is largely
unexplored terrain.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-58">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-58">58.</a>  Indeed this is
already a bad result for the monist, leaving aside any mention of
intrinsicness.  The moon and I are not duplicates. So it seems that
the monist had better say that the moon and I differ intrinsically, to
respect this claim.</p>

&ldquo;Humeanism&rdquo; is being used in the sense popularized by David Lewis.

necessary connections in nature through common parthood.</p>

<h2>Philosophy and the Tradition of Architectural Theory</h2>

<p>While philosophy of architecture is relatively new as a growing
sub-discipline, we can look to a two-millennia old tradition of
theoretical treatises in architecture (in the West; other traditions
are older still) as raising key conceptual issues. The architectural
theory tradition encompasses critical commentary on or explanations of
architectural works or styles or movements; instructions or guidelines
for architectural design; musings on the origins of building types or
styles; and advocacy for new approaches to the architectural
discipline and practice. Works in this multifaceted Western
tradition&mdash;written by architects, architectural critics, and
architectural historians&mdash;range historically from Vitruvius (15
BCE) through the present. From a philosophical perspective,
this &ldquo;native&rdquo; architectural theory tradition introduces
questions about how to best explore conceptual foundations or
establish imperatives for architectural practice, design thought, or
architectural history; how to mine varied theoretical schemes of
architects for philosophical insights; and (relatedly) what sort of
commerce philosophical aesthetics may have with architectural
theory. The centrality of Vitruvian principles in architectural theory
prompts further questions&mdash;answered at least obliquely in the
aesthetics of architecture&mdash;as to what sort of principles these
are (useful for judgment, guiding practice, etc.) and whether they are
essential to defining architecture.</p>

<p>Any overview of the history of architectural theory in this context
may only be embarrassingly brief and instrumental. The rich scope,
variety, and significance of this two millennia-old tradition are out
of reach; see Kruft (1994) or Mallgrave (2005) for thorough histories
of these traditions. This coarse categorization of theories is
doubtless objectionable but captures at least one signal
characteristic. Across the many dimensions of architectural theory,
authors in the tradition have been (and are) in the main
<em>architects</em> who seek to account for what they and others do,
and should do, in architecture. Some architects cast doubt on the
value of theory in a world where one can simply express design thought
through actual design (Johnson 1994). Yet the history of architecture
suggests at least this distinctive value: theory over the ages offers
a historical record of what architects have thought important to
communicate to other architects (and perhaps to broader audiences), to
best understand the practice and governing concepts of the
discipline. Architectural theory looks to be a piece with the
<em>maker&rsquo;s knowledge</em> tradition in the Renaissance sciences
and as celebrated by Descartes and Bacon: we acquire a sort of
knowledge through doing&mdash;as in the trial and error of design and
construction&mdash;which we can then transmit to others for their
enlightenment and benefit (Hintikka 1974).</p>

<p>The notion of knowledge through doing is apt for Vitruvius, as for
so many who follow. Of the ten books of <em>De Architectura</em>,
eight are dedicated to building materials, civic infrastructure, civil
engineering and technology (and the underlying science), and building
types <em>other</em> than temples. In short, the Vitruvian picture of
architecture is rooted in experiential knowledge of making, doing, and
crafting. Even the beauty of the orders is communicated through a
cataloging of elements of the temple building type.</p>

<p>In addition, Vitruvius&rsquo; main contributions to the history of
architectural theory include (1) his canonical account of the
classical orders (Books III and IV), and (2) identification of three
principles of architecture, <em>firmitas</em>, <em>utilitas</em>,
<em>venustas</em>, conventionally translated as structural integrity,
utility, and beauty; or (<em>per</em> Wotton 1624) firmness,
commodity, and delight. Following a train of architectural theorists
and architects across the past two millennia, we may variously
understand these principles&mdash;the &ldquo;Vitruvian
triad&rdquo;&mdash;as fundamental categorial beliefs, imperatives for
practice, or guides to architectural value.</p>

<p>Vitruvian influence on subsequent architectural theory cannot be
overstated. Architectural theory as a didactic or polemic pursuit
(beyond <em>De Architectura</em>, which Vitruvius may have intended as
a documentary effort) was launched in the Renaissance with Leon
Battista Alberti&rsquo;s <em>De Re Aedificatoria</em> (1485). Alberti offered a
&ldquo;recovery&rdquo; of Vitruvius and an outward tribute to the
Vitruvian triad as definitive pronouncement of architecture&rsquo;s
aims&mdash;hence the measure of architectural success. </p>

<p>Subsequent theoretical developments included Renaissance and early
modern explorations of perspective, as launched by Alberti and
continued in the work of Desargues (1642) and Bosse (1643). With the
Enlightenment focus on human nature and diversity of human experience,
theorists such as Laugier (1753/55) presented architectural design as
a basic chapter in human development. The birth of art criticism
(Winckelmann 1764) and rediscovery of ancient cities like Pompeii
energized investigations of and polemics on behalf of classicism
(inspired by the earlier treatise and work of Palladio (1570)) as
a stylistic framework for new architecture.  Nineteenth century
theorists such as Pugin (1843) and Ruskin (1849) countered that
religiously inspired morality, exposure of &ldquo;essential&rdquo;
structure, and honest craft favored a revived Gothic style over the
dominant neo-classicism. Other theoretical highlights of that century
include Viollet-le-Duc&rsquo;s proposals (1863-1872) that
&ldquo;honest&rdquo; design reflects construction techniques deployed,
and that particular architectural forms call for use of corresponding
materials; the similarly-minded <em>Realismus</em> of, among others,
Semper (1860) and O. Wagner (1896), promoting necessity and
fidelity to materials and construction as guides to architectural
expression; and Sitte&rsquo;s integration (1889) of architecture
with urbanism, whereby the proper level for aesthetically gauging
architecture is the totality of a given urban space rather than its
constituent built structures.</p>

<p>The modernist movement in architecture was broadly announced,
beyond the architectural world, in a series of polemical statements by
Sullivan (1896) who crafted the functionalist motto in his phrase
&ldquo;form ever follows function&rdquo;; Loos (1913), who decried ornament as
&ldquo;criminal&rdquo;; and Le Corbusier (1923), who declared that
architecture&rsquo;s character should be shaped by technological
possibilities of the day. Architectural theory of the postwar era
looked to ever more abstract intellectual currents for inspiration, in
the phenomenological approaches of Rasmussen (1959) and Norberg-Schulz
(1965), semiotic explorations of Koenig (1964) and Jencks and Baird
(1969), and Marxist analysis of Tafuri (1973).</p>

<p>Recent architectural theory integrates insights from a host of
other disciplines, including literary theory (Eisenman 2004; Wigley
1993); Continental philosophy (Pallasmaa 2005; Vesely 2004); Chomskyian linguistics
(Alexander et al. 1977);
information theory and computer science (Mitchell 1990); sociology (Lefebvre
1970 and 1974); urban studies (Krier 2009; Koolhaas 1978);
cultural studies (Rapoport 1969; Oliver 1969); and science studies
(P&eacute;rez-G&oacute;mez 1983). This great breadth leads some to see
an interdisciplinary discipline which, more wide-ranging than
architectural history, constitutes the &ldquo;architectural
humanities&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Much of architectural theory, from Alberti to Palladio, and from
Perrault to Blondel, observes a straightforward Vitruvian homage to
the orders and classicism as a whole. While current practice informs
their theories, they are one step removed from a &ldquo;pure&rdquo;
maker&rsquo;s knowledge. Their design thinking, while reflective of
their own works, also borrows heavily on classic theoretical works and
Vitruvius in particular. This combination of reporting on the basis of
craft experience and advocacy on behalf of past tradition also
characterizes proponents of the gothic alternatives to classics, Pugin
and Ruskin, as well as proponents of postmodernism and, for that
matter, all other revivalisms. Modernist theorists, too, of various
stripes, from Sullivan to Le Corbusier to Neutra, build their theories
on an architect&rsquo;s maker&rsquo;s knowledge&mdash;more purely so,
if we take at face value their rejection of all revivalisms.</p>

<p>Central chapters in the history of architectural theory, though not
generally linked to philosophical traditions in aesthetics, call our
attention to foundational issues in architecture. These issues include
explorations of that fundamental conceptual framework, the Vitruvian
triad; a developing comprehension of tectonics&mdash;that is,
structure and its revelation in design; and the waxing and waning
promotion of ornament.</p>

<p>Other key figures in the history of architectural theory were
<em>not</em> architects, including Laugier, Winckelmann, and
Tafuri. One need not be a practitioner to understand architecture at
its conceptual core, to recognize its organizing principles, or to
have a vision as to what design thinking trumps others. However,
<em>per</em> the historical record, theory generally is the product of
practitioners&rsquo; thinking. This fact shapes the nature of the
genre, at a minimum relative to its goals and to reasonable
expectations among consumers of the genre, including possible
interlocutors in philosophical aesthetics.</p>

<p>Two primary goals of practitioners&rsquo; thinking in architectural
theory are systemization and explanation on one hand, and prescription
on another:</p>

<p class="indent">First, architectural theory represents a
codification of practical architectural knowledge: what we currently
know about how to do or categorize architecture (e.g., Vitruvius), how
architecture should be done (e.g., Alexander 1979), or how to explain
aspects of architectural practice, such as spatial structuring (e.g.,
Hillier and Hanson 1984).</p>

<p class="indent">Second, architectural theory comprises prescriptive,
even didactic, expression&mdash;the intent of which is to (a) promote
given or new ways in which to do architecture and (b) ground
architectural practice in moral, social, psychological, or theoretical
bases. (The didactic tendency issues in a tradition of treatises and
manifestos.) In this prescriptive sense, theory frequently suggests a
best understanding of architecture, as it may be related to other
cultural forms or general cultural contexts (Pallasmaa 2012) or to
objectives of other domains, such as ecological sustainability
(Yeang 2006). Yet other prescriptive elements of theory promote particular visions of
design method, such as design after organic forms (Portoghesi 2000),
mathematical forms (Burry and Burry 2012), or adoption of design
algorithms (Mitchell 1990). This tradition in theory is broadly Vitruvian, as the
more fundamental reasons adduced for pursuing any given design method
are invariably some combination of structural effectiveness,
usefulness, and attractiveness.</p>

<p>The two modalities are not mutually exclusive; explanation of
current practice is a natural background for prescriptive theory.
This may be desirable in some respects. Thus, Korydon Smith (2012)
sees a role for architectural theory in providing conceptual
frameworks for evaluation of a work, whether in the context of juried
reviews or &ldquo;crits&rdquo; or any other form of commerce of
architectural ideas. That is a common enough conception of how
theories are conceived and used. This approach, however common,
prompts objection from those who would uphold a non-normative,
value-free understanding of what architecture is and does. Let the
vision of what <em>should be</em> emerge separately.</p>

<p>That, however, is not the thrust of native architectural
theory. Instead, there is a studied, core rejection of objective,
non-normative notions of the nature of architectural practices, the
roles of architectural creator and spectator, or even what
architectural works count as objects of the form. For example, the
role of the architect is defined very differently by, say, Sitte
(architect as urban planner) or Frampton (architect as articulator of
structure)&mdash;and architects generally accept that there is no
value-free, non-normative fact of the matter. This is not a theory
pluralism so much as the view that which theory of the
architect&rsquo;s role (or other aspects of architecture) is viewed as
correct depends on one&rsquo;s context and interests. </p>

<p>A second perspectivalist feature of native architectural theories
is that they connect explanatory frameworks with stylistic commitments
that bear attendant baggage. Part of this conflation is the tendency
to run together the descriptive and the normative, such that if there
is a compelling defense of a style (say, postmodernism), then one
should build in that style, and <em>vice-versa</em>. Yet we wouldn&rsquo;t perpetuate all and only styles in
favor by critics, and we wouldn&rsquo;t award contracts to architects
with the best critiquing skills <em>in lieu</em> of the best
designs. The underlying suggestion is that guidelines for designing
built structures are the same guidelines for judging their
merits. This view rests on the improbable notion that
guidelines for design and judgment are one and the same, related
though they may be in connecting style and critical frameworks. </p>

<p>One way to assess the history of native architectural theories is
as the progressive effort to better accommodate differing notions of
architectural practice and objects. By dint of their varying
perspectives, each theory brings a possible piece of a viable account
to the table. While it may not be palatable methodologically to accept
the integration of analysis and norms for design and evaluation, it is
instructive to locate where architectural theories are
&ldquo;situated&rdquo; by their plainly stated values. Here native
theory and its value aspects offer a contrast with conceptual focus in
philosophical aesthetics where, at some remove from the
practitioner&rsquo;s role, practical consequences typically do not
arise. They must arise, however, for architectural theories more
intimately connected to the lives of practicing architects.</p>

<p>This may well be what we <em>want</em> in native architectural
theories, given the social and personal utility in the design and
realization of architectural objects. We want architects, and
architectural critics and historians, to reflect on driving concepts
and abstractions that shape our built environment in forward-thinking,
planning-oriented fashion. Getting the right prescriptions in
architectural thought amounts to a social good, perhaps as a moral
imperative.</p>

<p>Rare is the theorist who does not at least make a passing reference
to <em>utilitas</em>&mdash;socially defined or otherwise. (And, on one
reading, <em>firmitas</em> (firmness) just is another brand of
Vitruvian utility.) Native architectural theory frequently weds
utility to style&mdash;hence to our evaluative notions of, for
example, beauty. This, too, is a central Vitruvian point, followed by
many, if not most, through the present day.</p>

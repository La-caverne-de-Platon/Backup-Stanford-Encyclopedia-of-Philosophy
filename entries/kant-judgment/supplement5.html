<h2>Completing the Picture of Kant&rsquo;s Metaphysics of Judgment</h2>

<h3><a name="A">A. Judgments of experience, the categories, and the B Deduction</a></h3>

<p>

So far in Section 3, we have concentrated on the connection
between transcendental idealism and Kant&rsquo;s theory of the meaning and
truth of empirical judgments. But in a sense this has gotten the cart
before the horse, because above all Kant wants to show that the
synthetic a priori judgments expressing the first principles of Kant&rsquo;s
own metaphysics of nature are meaningful and true only if
transcendental idealism is correct. As a first step towards showing
this, Kant offers the following very famous argument:</p>

<ol>
<li>Empirical judgments, or judgments of experience, are
&ldquo;about,&rdquo; or directed to, objects of experience.</li>

<li>Given the strongest version of transcendental idealism, the logical forms implicit in the
propositional contents of judgments of experience are imposed upon
unstructured sensory representations, or conscious perceptions, in
order to constitute the objects of experience.</li>

<li>These logical forms are &ldquo;pure concepts of the
understanding&rdquo; (a priori concepts) or &ldquo;categories&rdquo; (a
priori concepts insofar as they specifically apply to objects) that are
originally derived from pure general logic, when construed as an
exhaustive theory of logico-syntactic and logico-semantic
forms <em>of</em> and <em>in</em> propositional contents.</li>

<li>Since the spatiotemporal forms of intuition that necessarily
govern all conscious perceptions, and also the pure concepts of the
understanding or categories that govern all propositional contents of
judgments, alike fall under the faculty of apperception, or rational
self-consciousness, when apperception is directly combined with the
faculty of the imagination and its figural synthesis or <em>synthesis
speciosa</em> (the combination of which Kant calls &ldquo;the original
synthetic unity of apperception&rdquo;), <em>and since the strongest version of transcendental
idealism is true</em>, it follows that the objectivity of any object
of experience is strictly determined by the forms of intuition plus
the categories that are alike implicit in judgments of experience
about those objects and also literally imposed upon those objects of
experience by the faculties of the judging subject in acts of
judgment.
</li>

<li>Therefore the categories necessarily apply to all and only the
objects of experience, and are objectively valid.</li>

</ol>

<p>

The argument just sketched is a thumbnail version of the
Transcendental Deduction of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding in
the B edition of the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> (B129&ndash;B169),
more commonly known as &ldquo;the B Deduction.&rdquo; This is certainly
not the place to engage in a critical discussion of the many different
possible interpretations of the B Deduction; nor is it the place to
relate the B Deduction to the A Deduction. For our purposes right now,
the crucial points to notice are three.</p>

<p>

First, as many commentators have noted, there is an intimate and
indeed necessary connection between Kant&rsquo;s theory of judgment and the
B Deduction. Without the centrality thesis and the
priority-of-the-proposition thesis, the argument could not even be
valid, much less sound. Kant&rsquo;s conception of the objectivity of
objects of experience, and the role that the categories play in
determining this objectivity, both depend heavily on the assumption
that all human cognition is centrally judgmental, and also on the
further assumption that judgmental cognition is essentially
propositional.</p>

<p>

Second, as many commentators have also noted, the conclusion of the B
Deduction depends intimately and again indeed necessarily on Kant&rsquo;s
conception of the role of the faculty of apperception or rational
self-consciousness in the nature of the judgment. Without Kant&rsquo;s
doctrine that the unity of the proposition is strictly determined by
the higher-order self-representations introduced by the faculty of
apperception, it could not be the case that the pure concepts of the
understanding, as logical forms, would necessarily carry over into the
objects of experience, as constituting their objective structure.</p>

<p>

Third and finally, as perhaps fewer commentators have noticed, the
linchpin of the argument is in fact the antecedent of step 4, which
asserts that the unity of the spatiotemporal forms of intuition and
the unity of propositional content in judgments is <em>identically the
same</em> unity, namely the unity imposed by the faculty of rational
self-consciousness in accordance with the categories, when it is
directly combined with the faculty of imagination and its figural
synthesis. In other words, according to Kant the
spatiotemporal <em>intuitional</em> unity of the content of our
conscious perceptual representations is necessarily also a
fully <em>logico-conceptual</em> unity. If this claim were not true,
then the unity of conscious perceptions of objects in space and time
might be distinct from the unity of judgments, and, assuming
transcendental idealism, even though the categories necessarily
applied to all objects of experience, there might then still be some
spatiotemporal objects of conscious perception to which the categories
either do <em>not</em> actually apply, or at least
not <em>necessarily</em> apply: that is, there might be some objects
of human <em>intuition</em> that are not also objects of
human <em>experience</em>, in the strong sense that those objects of
human intuition either actually do or possibly could turn out to
be <em>nomologically ill-behaved or unconstrained</em>, thereby
falling outside the categories. Let us call such categorially-anarchic objects <em>rogue objects</em>. Examples of rogue objects would include objects of
intuition that engaged in systematically counter-nomological behavior
(magic), purely random or indeterministic behavior (pure chance), teleological behavior (organismic life), arbitrary orderings of representations in inner sense (the spontaneity of consciousness), or incompatibilistic causal determination at the source of human intentional action (the practical spontaneity of freedom). The deterministic causal laws of
natural science, and thus also the objectively valid category of cause and effect, would simply fail
to apply to all such rogue objects of perception. We will
return to this crucial point about the real possibility of categorial anarchy in Section 4.1.</p>

<h3><a name="B">B. Transcendental judgments, transcendental schematism, and the Second Analogy of Experience</a></h3>

<p>
 
One last piece needs to be fitted into the puzzle in order to give us
a fairly complete picture of Kant&rsquo;s metaphysics of judgment. We saw in
Section 2.2.3 that Kant&rsquo;s project in the first <em>Critique</em> can
be glossed as the attempt to explain how synthetic a priori judgments
are possible. But what is the connection between this project and the
B Deduction? The answer is that the B Deduction, if sound, shows that
the categories are objectively valid, and then objectively valid
synthetic a priori judgments <em>containing</em> the categories can be
formulated in order to state general metaphysical truths about the
possibility of our cognition of objects of experience and
correspondingly (assuming the strongest version of transcendental idealism) about the
possibility of objects of experience themselves. Now granting that
these categorial synthetic a priori judgments are properly generated
both as to their logical form and semantic content, it will then
follow that they compositionally inherit the objective validity of
their constituent categorial concepts. So these judgments will be at
once objectively valid, non-empirical or a priori, necessarily true,
and also synthetic or non-logical. Furthermore they will also be
specifically <em>about</em> the objects of possible human
experience. In short, they will make up the subject-matter of Kant&rsquo;s
own transcendental metaphysics of nature. Kant calls such judgments
&ldquo;principles of pure understanding&rdquo; (A148/B187), and
correspondingly he also calls the extension of his theory of judgment
to these principles, &ldquo;the analytic of principles&rdquo; or
&ldquo;the transcendental doctrine of the power of judgment&rdquo;
(A137/176).</p>

<p>

The transcendental doctrine of the power of judgment consists of two
parts: (1) the &ldquo;schematism of the pure concepts of the
understanding&rdquo; or transcendental schematism (A137&ndash;A147/B176&ndash;187),
and (2) the system of all principles of pure understanding
(A148&ndash;235/B187&ndash;294), which formally corresponds to the architectonic
format of the table of categories, which in turn mimics the
architectonic format of the table of logical forms in judgments (see
Section 2.1.1):</p>

<blockquote>

<em>Table of Categories</em> 

<ol>
<li>Categories of Quantity: Unity, Plurality, Totality</li>

<li>Categories of Quality: Reality, Negation, Limitation</li>

<li>Categories of Relation: Inherence and Subsistence (substantia et
accidens), Causality and Dependence (cause and effect), community
(reciprocity between agent and patient)</li>

<li>Categories of Modality: Possibility--Impossibility,
Existence--Non-existence, Necessity--Contingency (CPR A80/B106)</li>
</ol>

<p>
<em>System of Principles</em> </p>

<ol>
<li>Axioms of Intuition</li>

<li>Anticipations of Perception</li>

<li>Analogies of Experience</li>

<li>Postulates of Empirical Thinking in General (CPR A161/B200)</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>

<p>
Two leading questions can now be formulated. First, what bearing does
the transcendental schematism of the categories have on the
transcendental doctrine of the judgment? As we saw in passing in
Section 1, schemata are products of the faculty of imagination, and
more specifically, they are supplementary rules for interpreting
general conceptual rules in terms of more specific figural
spatiotemporal forms and sensory images. Schemata are needed by Kant
in order to overcome two apparent gaps: an ontological gap between
abstract universals and concrete particulars on the one hand, and a
cognitive gap between concepts and intuitions on the other hand.  This
holds not only at the level of empirical judgment, where the cognitive
gap is between the conceptual (attributive or descriptive) parts of
the judgment on the one hand and the intuitional (directly
referential) parts of the judgment on the other, but also at the
transcendental level, where the gap is between pure concepts or
categories on the one hand and individual objects of experience on the
other. Kant&rsquo;s seminal idea here is that schemata can mediate between
the one side (abstract universals, empirical concepts, pure concepts)
and the other side (concrete particulars, empirical intuitions,
objects of experience) precisely because they are at once
figural-formal and <em>also</em> intrinsically sensory. But there is
also a decidedly semantic aspect to the doctrine of schematism, because
the schemata can be properly regarded as special rules
for <em>interpreting</em> otherwise uninterpreted items on the one
side, in terms of intermediate spatiotemporal sensory structures or
models, so that the items on the one side can then be <em>applied</em>
to items on the other side, which will in turn function as the
semantic values of the items on the first side. All the transcendental
schemata, according to Kant, express various formal properties of
time: properties of &ldquo;the time-series, the content of time, the
order of time, and the sum total of time&rdquo; (A145/B184&ndash;185). What
this means then is that every objectively valid judgment, whether
empirical or a priori, and in particular synthetic a priori, must
implicitly include a schematic a priori formal temporal component that
functions as an intermediate structure for interpreting the purely
logical elements of judgments and thereby securing their applicability
to objects of actual or possible experience.</p>

<p>

Second, what bearing does the system of principles have on the
transcendental doctrine of the judgment? As mentioned above,
principles of pure understanding, as synthetic a priori propositions
about the objects of experience, make up the subject-matter of Kant&rsquo;s
transcendental metaphysics of nature. Hence, assuming the strongest version of transcendental
idealism, every such principle tells us how one of the categories
partially constitutes objects of experience in general, by determining
an objectively real phenomenal structure across all possible worlds of
human experience. For example, consider the Second Analogy of
Experience, which Kant describes as &ldquo;the principle of temporal
sequence according to the law of causality,&rdquo; and which says that
&ldquo;all alterations occur in accordance with the law of the
connection of cause and effect&rdquo; (A189&ndash;211/B232&ndash;256). According to
the first Analogy, Kant regards &ldquo;alterations,&rdquo; or singular
events, as momentary attributions of distinct phenomenal properties
(always occurring in a temporal succession of such moments) to an
underlying permanently unchanging (or at any rate temporarily
enduring) material substance in space, which is thereby the bearer of
those properties and also the metaphysical analogue of the logical
subject of predication (A182&ndash;189/B224&ndash;232). Against this backdrop, and
again assuming the strongest version of transcendental idealism, Kant&rsquo;s fundamental idea in the
Second Analogy is that singular events in phenomenal nature are causes
if and only if they sufficiently determine, or necessitate, later
singular events according to specific natural laws. This in turn
answers Hume&rsquo;s worry about the absence of necessary connection in
phenomenal nature, by insisting that causal relations are imposed on
sensory phenomena in temporal succession by cognizing subjects, via
judgments of experience, and exist neither in themselves nor in the
raw data of sensory experience. Kant also insists that necessarily all
such causal sequences of phenomenal events are temporally
irreversible, although he does not (contrary to Strawson&rsquo;s famous and
witty charge that Kant here commits &ldquo;a <em>non sequitur</em> of
numbing grossness&rdquo; [Strawson 1966, 137]) hold the converse,
namely that necessarily every temporally irreversible sequence of
phenomenal events is causal. Finally, Kant also holds that all and
only the objects of experience are such that every one of their real
attributes in time is causally necessitated by earlier events
according to specific natural laws; and this sharply distinguishes
them from temporal sequences of phenomenal properties which are
ordered in a merely arbitrary fashion that depends on the vagaries of
mere inner sense or phenomenal consciousness. So the synthetic a
priori principle of cause and effect is also a criterion of the
objectivity of objects of experience. The upshot is that the Second
Analogy of Experience, like every principle of pure understanding, is
an objectively valid and necessarily true synthetic a priori judgment
because it expresses both a pure concept or category (in this case,
the category of cause and effect) and a corresponding a priori schema
(in this case, the successive character of time [A144/B183]) that (in
this case regulatively, under the existential condition that the
relevant causal event actually occurs) guarantees the application of
that category to objects of experience. </p>

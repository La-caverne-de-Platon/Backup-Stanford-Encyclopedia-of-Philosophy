<h2>The Influence of John Locke&rsquo;s Works</h2>

<p>
Hans Aarsleff remarks that Locke &ldquo;is the most influential
philosopher of modern times&rdquo;. He notes that besides initiating
the vigorous tradition known as British empiricism, Locke&rsquo;s
influence reached far beyond the limits of the traditional discipline
of philosophy: &ldquo;His influence in the history of thought, on the
way we think about ourselves and our relation to the world we live in,
to God, nature and society, has been immense&rdquo; (Aarsleff 1994:
252). Locke may well have
influenced such diverse eighteenth century figures as Swift, Johnson,
Sterne, Voltaire, Priestly and Jefferson.</p>

<p>
Beginning with the publication of the 92 page summary of the
<em>Essay</em> in the <em>Bibliotheque universelle et historique</em>
for January through March of 1688 along with the publication of the
first edition in December 1689, the <em>Essay</em> was both popular
and controversial on both the continent and in England for the next
fifty years. The sustained argument in <em>An Essay Concerning Human
Understanding</em> for rejecting the old scholastic model of knowledge
and science in favor of empirically disciplined modes of inquiry was
enormously successful. Locke&rsquo;s arguments against innate
principles and ideas largely prevailed. This was an early and striking
success of the <em>Essay</em>. Recall that Locke&rsquo;s attack on
innate ideas was part and parcel of his anti-authoritarianism and his
emphasis on the importance of free and autonomous inquiry. As Aarsleff
also notes, the radical nature of Locke&rsquo;s attacks on epistemic,
political and religious authority are difficult for us to grasp today. (Aarsleff, 1994, 258)
Bishop Stillingfleet, the most prominent of Locke&rsquo;s early
critics, claimed that Locke&rsquo;s new way of ideas would lead to
skepticism and that his account of substance undermined the doctrine
of the trinity. Locke denied this, but given that we have good reason
to hold that Locke was an anti-trinitarian, we have some reason to
doubt that this denial is sincere. Locke&rsquo;s epistemological views
and his advocacy of rational religion were taken up by early
eighteenth century deists such as John Toland and Anthony Collins who
drew conclusions about religion that outraged the orthodox. The age of
rational religion was coming to a close by the middle of the
eighteenth century.</p>

<p>
Within a few years of the publication of the fifth edition of
Locke&rsquo;s essay, Berkeley attacked the alliance between empiricism
and the science of Newton and the Royal Society which is an important
feature of Locke&rsquo;s <em>Essay</em>. Berkeley argued that the
causal or representative account of perception leads to skepticism
about the existence of the external world as there is no good solution
to the problem of the veil of perception and the associated
distinction between primary and secondary qualities is untenable.
These attacks gave rise to several misapprehensions about the
doctrines of the <em>Essay</em> and their connection with the history
of philosophy. If one accepts Berkeley&rsquo;s arguments the result is
the view that empiricism leads to idealism and that the atomism which
Locke regarded as the most plausible hypothesis about the world must
be abandoned. Locke certainly thought he had the resources to solve
the problems posed by the veil of perception doctrine and his account
of the distinction between primary and secondary qualities is not the
same as the one that Berkeley gives. Nonetheless, Berkeley&rsquo;s
attacks on the <em>Essay</em> have produced long lasting and
influential misinterpretations of the <em>Essay</em>. These
misinterpretations led Thomas Reid, for example, to the rejection of
the way of ideas (as it leads to the denial of the existence of the
external world) and probably fueled Kant&rsquo;s notion that the
British empiricism of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries with
its characteristic inadequacies and virtues is one of the two great
streams leading inevitably towards his own transcendental idealism. If
one does not accept the force of Berkeley&rsquo;s arguments, then
neither Reid&rsquo;s conclusion or Kant&rsquo;s story have much force
to them.</p>

<p>
Locke&rsquo;s account of personal identity was genuinely revolutionary
and a real contribution to philosophy. This, along with his
agnosticism about whether the soul was material or immaterial were
debated hotly through much of the eighteenth century and at least the
debates about personal identity were largely recapitulated in the
twentieth century. Much of this begins with the Clarke/Collins
controversy of 1707&ndash;08. Locke&rsquo;s account of free agency is just as interesting and important as his account of personal identity
with which it is connected. Yet it seems not to have been as
controversial as Locke&rsquo;s account of personal identity. Gideon
Yaffe&rsquo;s recent book <em>Liberty Worth the Name</em> (2000) may
well revive interest in Locke&rsquo;s views on this subject as Yaffe
argues that they are still of relevance to contemporary debates about
free will and compatibilism.</p>

<p>
The extent of the influence that Locke&rsquo;s account of language has
had over the centuries is a matter of scholarly debate. Norman
Kretzmann (1968) holds that Locke&rsquo;s views, while not original, had a
powerful influence on the Enlightenment view of the connection of
words and ideas. Noam Chomsky
in <em>Cartesian Linguistics</em> (1966) traces the important ideas in
linguistics back to Descartes and the school at Port Royal rather than
Locke. This is largely a matter of the importance of the innate in
Chomsky&rsquo;s thought. Hans Aarsleff, on the other hand, believes
that Locke stands at the beginning of the developments that produced
contemporary linguistics and that Chomsky&rsquo;s account is more
polemical than historical (Aarsleff 1982: 101&ndash;119.</p>

<p>
That Locke&rsquo;s works on education had considerable influence is
indicated by the four editions that were published in his lifetime, a
fifth that came out after his death and some twenty-one editions in
the eighteenth century. There were numerous translations into European
languages during the eighteenth century as well. Peter Gay remarked
that &ldquo;John Locke was the founder of the Enlightenment in
education as in much else&rdquo; (Gay 1964: 1).</p>

<p>
<em>The Two Treatises of Government</em> were published anonymously
and it was only in Locke&rsquo;s will that he acknowledged the
authorship of this work and others such as the Letters Concerning
Toleration. As a consequence the <em>Two Treatises</em> had very
little influence on the debates over how to justify the legitimacy of
replacing King James II with William and Mary. John Dunn claims that
in the eighteenth century in England the work had little
influence (Dunn 1969: 17). It was supposed that
since it was written by England&rsquo;s greatest philosopher it must
be the way things were done but few bothered to read it. Certainly
conservatives such as Josiah Tucker read it and rejected its
doctrines. There has been considerable scholarly debate about how much
Locke&rsquo;s political doctrines affected the American
revolutionaries and the writing of the American declaration of
independence. The original claim that Locke&rsquo;s thought had
considerable influence on the colonists was challenged and has more
recently been reaffirmed. In France, Locke was influential through the
first half of the eighteenth century and then rapidly lost influence
as the French came to regard the English as conservative.</p>

<p>
In the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Locke&rsquo;s views
were largely rejected and his influence was at its lowest ebb. He was
regarded as one of the prophets of the American and French
revolutions. The doctrines of natural rights and human rights were
rejected in favor of utilitarianism. Locke&rsquo;s philosophy was
largely misinterpreted and rejected. Even the publication of Fox
Bourne&rsquo;s two volume biography of Locke (1876) hardly raised any
new interest.</p>

<p>
In the twentieth century with the sale of the Lovelace papers and
their donation to Oxford University, interest in Locke among
philosophers has considerably revived. These papers included letters,
several drafts of the <em>Essay</em> and other works. We now know
considerably more about Locke and the development of his thought than
was known previously and Locke scholars have been putting
Locke&rsquo;s philosophy in its historical, religious, political and
intellectual context.This renewed interest in Locke&rsquo;s philosophy has continued apace into the twenty-first century..</p>

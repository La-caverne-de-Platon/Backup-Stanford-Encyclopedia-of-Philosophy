<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Ecology</a></h2>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a> &ldquo;Ecology&rdquo; was
but one of many terms that Haeckel introduced&mdash;one historian
calls him the &ldquo;busiest name-maker of his time&rdquo;; see
Worster (1994), p.  192. For a history of ecology with an emphasis on
population ecology, see Kingsland (1985). For a philosophical defense
of Haeckel's conception of ecology, see Cooper (2004). For a very
different point of view, one that attempts to embed ecology in its
human and cultural context, see Haila and Levins (1992).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a> There have been many
discussions of model construction in ecology, though usually only in
the context of population ecology (or, more generally, population
biology, that is, including population genetics). See, for instance,
Levins (1966), with further discussion by Wimsatt (1987), Orzack and
Sober (1993), Odenbaugh (2003), and Justus (2005).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a> Some philosophers will
find this assessment of theory in ecology overly pessimistic; see
Shrader-Frechette and McCoy (1993), Sarkar (1996), and Weber (1999)
for further discussion. Others will argue for the existence of
ecological laws (for instance, Lawton [1999], Lange [2002] and
Ginzburg and Colyvan [2004]).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a> &ldquo;Nothing in biology
makes sense except in the light of evolution,&rdquo; as Dobzhansky (1973)
famously quipped.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a> See van Valen (1973) who,
however, only presents this formulation only as one that is
&ldquo;plausible.&rdquo; Problems arising from a stronger interpretation
should not be attributed to him.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a> See, for example, Peters
(1991) (who, however, frames the question in terms of Popperian
falsifiability). For a response, see Haila (1997).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a> This is sometimes also
called &ldquo;model uncertainty&rdquo; though that term also has other
uses. In any case &ldquo;sensitivity&rdquo; or
&ldquo;robustness&rdquo; (Levins 1966) analysis is supposed to provide
a way out from the problem. According to this methodological
stricture, only invariant results from a variety of different models
should be accepted with confidence. Much has been written about
robustness of this type (by philosophers [Wimsatt 1987; Orzack and
Sober 1993; Justus 1995]) though it has never been formalized
successfully.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a> On issues connected with
the definition of complexity, see Zurek (1990).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a> A more extensive treatment
of some of the philosophical issues in population ecology is given by
Colyvan (forthcoming).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a> Scudo and Ziegler
(1978) collect most of the principal works from this period.  Their
use of &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; to describe this period underscores the
wealth of theoretical work in ecology during this period including,
especially, the work of Lotka and Volterra. Kingsland (1985) provides
a history.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a> Interactions between
individuals are also being regarded as properties of individuals.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a> There are two notable
exceptions: classical population ecology does include age- and
stage-structured models which subdivide the individuals of a
population in a series of age or life-stage classes. These fall
somewhere in the continuum between purely state-based and
individual-based models. This is an example of the demarcation
problem.  However, does it matter that models cannot be classified
into clean categories? Probably not, when it is recalled that hybrid
and confluent models are among the most fecund in many scientific
contexts&mdash;for more on this issue, see Sarkar (2005b).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a> Strictly speaking, this
already results in a population model of a community&mdash;an example
of the demarcation problem mentioned in Section 1.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a> For some, the former is
a fundamental law of ecology, and the latter a canonical model of the
field (see, for example, Ginzburg and Colyvan [2004]).  According to
these authors, changes from exponential growth should be regarded as
indicative of &ldquo;ecological forces&rdquo; in the same way that, in
classical mechanics, deviations from Newton's first law of motion
indicate the presence of physical forces.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a> See Finerty (1976) for
the history and an overview of the models; Chitty (1996) provides a
readable account of the current status.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a> See May (1976); Kot
(2001) provides a useful recent review.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a> See Kot (2001) for a
review of the dispute.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a> In the context of
ecology Wimsatt (1980) is one of the few philosophical explorations
of the concept of randomness.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a> For a full statement of
the act, see &ldquo;The United States National Forest Management Act
of 1976&rdquo; in the Other Internet Resources section.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a> See Zaber, David J.,
&ldquo;Southern Lessons: Saving Species through the National Forest
Management Act&rdquo; in the Other Internet Resources section.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a> Shaffer (1978),
pp. 8-9. Shaffer's choice of the Yellowstone grizzly bears has had the
result that almost all early examples of stochastic PVA relied on that
data set. See Beissinge (2002), pp. 6-7.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a> Shaffer (1978),
p. 12. For a more detailed critique of the MVP concept, see Sarkar
(2005a).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a> Gilpin and Soul&eacute;
(1986), p. 19. The early enthusiasm for PVA is best expressed by
Shaffer's somewhat grandiose hope: &ldquo;Like physicists searching
for a grand unified theory explaining how the four fundamental forces
&hellip;interact to control the structure and fate of the universe,
conservation biologists now seek their own grand unified theory
explaining how habitat type, quality, quantity, and pattern interact
to control the structures and fates of species. Population viability
analysis (PVA) is the first expression of this quest (Shaffer, in
Meffe and Carroll [1994], pp. 305&ndash;306).&rdquo; As the text
notes, in retrospect, PVA did not live up to this promise.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a> for example, Margules
(1989). Caughley (1994) offers a different critique of stochastic
PVA. For a response, see Hedrick <em>et al</em>.  (1996).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a> See, for example,
Grumbine (1992), p. 32, and almost any textbook of conservation
biology from the 1990s.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a> In a piece in <em>Other
Inquisitions</em> Borges introduced an alleged Chinese encyclopedia in
which animals are classified as: (i) those that belong to the Emperor;
(ii) embalmed ones; (iii) those that are trained; (iv) suckling pigs;
(v) mermaids; (vi) fabulous ones; (vii) stray dogs; (viii) those
included in the present classification; (ix) those that tremble as if
they were mad; (x) innumerable ones; (xi) those drawn with a very fine
camelhair brush; (xii) others; (xiii) those that have just broken a
flower vase; and (xiv) those that from a long way off look like
flies. Borges' classification provided one inspiration for Foucault's
(1970) justly famous musings on the nature of classification, and the
power relations embodied in such arrangements, in <em>The Order of
Things</em>.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a> Lande <em>et
al</em>. (2003), p. 6. While this argument makes it clear why
environmental stochasticity should not be regarded as haveing an
explicit dependence on population size, the reasons for suggesting
that demographic stochasticity should have such a dependence are not
equally compelling.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a> Lande <em>et
al</em>. (2003), p. 7. Note that dependence on density <em>ipso
facto</em> requires a dependennce of population size.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-29" name="29">29.</a> Even with a
mathematical models, these definitions (like all definitions) are
partly conventional and acceptable only to the extent that they are
useful.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-30" name="30">30.</a> Foley (1994). The same
result was obtained independently by Lande (1993).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-31" name="31">31.</a> Foley (1997), however,
does not provided an explicit analysis of this case because he was
unable to produce an exact solution of the model.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a> Sarkar, unpublished
results, based on an exact solution of Foley's model.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-33" name="33">33.</a> See Odenbaugh (2005)
for an entry to the extensive literature. For all the extensive
discussion of the appropriate definition of &ldquo;community&rdquo; it
remains far from clear why the issue is important, that is, why it
matters to the construction of empirically adequate models&mdash;but
this is a topic that will be left for another occasion.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-34" name="34">34.</a> Such associations are
now usually called &ldquo;assemblages&rdquo; in contemporary
ecology.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-35" name="35">35.</a> See Levins (1974, 1975)
where loop analysis is first introduced; Puccia and Levins (1985)
further develop the theory. Note, however, that this is but one way of
representing communities and should not be taken as categorical.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-36" name="36">36.</a> As Goodman (1975,
p. 261) puts it: &ldquo;The diversity-stability hypothesis has been
trotted out time and time again as an argument for various
preservationist and environmentalist policies. It has seemed to offer
an easy way to refute the charge that these policies represent nothing
more than the subjective preferences of some minority
constituencies.&hellip;From a practical standpoint, the
diversity-stability hypothesis is not really necessary; even if the
hypothesis is completely false it remains logically
possible&mdash;and, on the best available evidence, very
likely&mdash;that disruption of the patterns of evolved interaction in
natural communities will have untoward, and occasionally catastrophic,
consequences. In other words, though the hypothesis many be false, the
policies it promotes are prudent.&rdquo; The rationale for
biodiversity conservation developed in the last chapter does not even
require Goodman's prudential argument to be sound even though it
probably is.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-37" name="37">37.</a> The qualifie
&ldquo;typically&rdquo; is necessary because it is conceivable that these
interaction are density-dependent with <em>B</em> interacting much
more strongly with <em>A</em> at lower densities (of <em>B</em>) than
at higher ones.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-38" name="38">38.</a> For a survey of
definitions and measures of diversity, see Magurran (1988). Ricotta
(2005) surveys some of the more recent work but is not
comprehensive.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-39" name="39">39.</a> For a very important
early analysis, see Lewontin (1969).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-40" name="40">40.</a> These tables are based on
James Justus' dissertation in progress (&ldquo;The Stability,
Complexity, Diversity Debate of Theoretical Community Ecology: A
Philosophical Analysis&rdquo;, Department of Philosophy, University of
Texas at Austin). Grimm and Wissel (1997) provide a more
comprehensive inventory which is very similarly organized as Box
3.2.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-41" name="41">41.</a> May (1973) notes a
concept of stability that is very close to this: the probability of
return to equilibrium.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-42" name="42">42.</a> Pimm (1991).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-43" name="43">43.</a> Pimm (1991).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-44" name="44">44.</a> Pianka (2000).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-45" name="45">45.</a> Pimm (1991).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-46" name="46">46.</a> Holling (1973); Pimm
(1991).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-47" name="47">47.</a> Lehman and Tilman
(2000) attribute this to Naeem (1998) who, however, does not
explicitly suggest the use of this criterion as a definition of
stability.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-48" name="48">48.</a> See May (1973) who,
finds a negative correlation; however, May replaces diversity with
complexity in his theoretical analyses. Nevertheless, the results of
his derivations probably remain correct if diversity is used instead
of complexity (as he measures it).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-49" name="49">49.</a> For a philosophical
attempt to trace the history of this metaphor, see Cuddington
(2001). See, also, Egerton (1973).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-50" name="50">50.</a> Pimm (1991) summarizes
the evidence for this conclusion as it appeared around 1990.  No more
recent similarly exhaustive survey seems to be available,</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-51" name="51">51.</a> See Gause (1934). Note,
however, that on the &ldquo;received view&rdquo; (Sarkar 2004, 2005b) of
evolution based on population genetics, natural selection does not
act between species. But, without invoking natural selection as
acting in such a way, it is hard to imagine how ecology can be
practiced. Once again, there is an obviously important open
philosophical question and, moreover, one the answer to which could
make a tangible difference to the practice of biology.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-52" name="52">52.</a> May (1973); Pimm
(1991). Note, also, the discussion of the last paragraph.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-55" name="55">55.</a> McCann
(2000). Unfortunately, because of their potential to mislead a broad
audience, McCann's claims are presented in a special section on
biodiversity in the eminent journal, <em>Nature</em>.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-56" name="56">56.</a> See Lange (2004), who
uses island biogeography theory to argue that ecology has laws; see,
also Shrader-Frechette (1990) and Sarkar (2005a) for discussions of
the use of species-area curves and island biogeography theory in
biodiversity conservation planning.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-57" name="57">57.</a> For a recent appraisal
of what is known about species-area relationships, see Rosenzweig
(2005).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-58" name="58">58.</a> Arrhenius (1921); see,
also, Gleason (1922) who appears to have obtained the result
independently.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-59" name="59">59.</a> Margules <em>et
al</em>. (1982) emphasize this shift in the explanation of the
species-area relation.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-60" name="60">60.</a> See, for example,
Connor and McCoy (1979) and the reply by Sugihara (1981).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-61" name="61">61.</a> His most important
results are presented in Preston (1962a, b).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-62" name="62">62.</a> Munroe (1948); Brown
and Lomolino (1989) provide a discussion of Munroe's work.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-63" name="63">63.</a> MacArthur and Wilson
(1963, 1967). For a recent balanced assessment of the status of this
theory, see Whittaker (1998).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-64" name="64">64.</a> In an interesting
theoretical innovation, Hubbell (2001) has recently added speciation
to this mix.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-65" name="65">65.</a> See, for instance,
Gilbert (1980); problems with the assumptions of the theory and the
difficulty of calibrating its parameters were pointed out as early as
1969 in Sauer's (1969) review of MacArthur and Wilson's book.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-73" name="73">73.</a> Margules <em>et
al</em>. (1982). Earlier, Higgs (1981) provided a theoretical
analysis comparing a single large reserve to two smaller ones, each
of which had half the area of the first. Whether the single reserve
or the pair permitted the coexistence of more species depended on
context; the island biogeography theory did not provide unequivocal
results.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-74" name="74">74.</a> Soul&eacute; and
Simberloff (1986). The history of the SLOSS debate is yet to receive
the philosophical attention it deserves (see, however,
Shrader-Frechette [1990] and, especially, Kingsland [2002]). Mann and
Plummer (1995) include a useful popular history.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-77" name="77">77.</a> See McIntosh (1985),
Chapter 6, for more details on this point.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-78" name="78">78.</a> Golley (1993) has
traced the history of the &ldquo;ecosystem concept,&rdquo; including
both the philosophical and the scientific developments discussed in
this section, in great detail.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-79" name="79">79.</a> See McIntosh (1985),
p. 205; for a partial contrast, see Golley (1993).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-80" name="80">80.</a> See, for example,
Bormann and Likens (1979a, b). Both McIntosh (1985) and Golley (1993)
identify this study as critical to the attempt to establish ecosystem
studies institutionally.</p>

<p>

<p>

especially, Sellers <em>et al</em>. (1997); Prentice <em>et

(2000).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-87" name="87">87.</a> See the important
review by Huston <em>et al</em>. (1988) which correctly predicted
that IBMs would change the nature of ecological modeling.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-88" name="88">88.</a> See, for example,
Shugart (1984) and Shugart <em>et al</em>. (1992). However, a
comprehensive comparative review of the success and failures of IBMs,
relative to traditional ecological models, does not appear to be
available at present.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-89" name="89">89.</a> See Shugart<em>et
al</em>. (1992) for detail.</p>

and Beissinger and Westphal (1998).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-91" name="91">91.</a> For more on this view
of reductionism, see Sarkar (1998).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-92" name="92">92.</a> Intrinsically systemic
properties are those that cannot be defined without reference to the
system as a whole as an ontological unit beyond the components that
comprise it.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-93" name="93">93.</a> For instance, Spencer
(1997) constructs such a model for small freshwater benthic habitats
with three trophic levels (algae, herbivorous invertebrates, and
predatory invertebrates).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-94" name="94">94.</a> Fryxell and Lundberg
(1998) take this unificatory strategy even further to include some
evolutionary considerations.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-95" name="95">95.</a> Roger Tomlinson, who
directed the project, and Duane Marble are the two individuals usually
credited with inventing the acronym &ldquo;GIS.&rdquo; Much of the
history recounted in the text is recounted in Tomlinson (1988).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-96" name="96">96.</a> These maps classified
areas according to: (a) soil capability for agriculture; (b)
recreational potential; (c) habitat potential for ungulates; (d)
habitat potential for waterfowl; (e) forestry potential; (f) present
land use; and (g) shoreline.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-97" name="97">97.</a> Running <em>et
al</em>. (1989).</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-98" name="98">98.</a> Spatial modeling on
regular geometric grids is not analogous to visual modeling in the
same way. Proper visual representation is supposed to be as veridical
as possible. This means that as much spatial detail as possible should
be incorporated into a model. Representing spatial structure as
globally geometrically regular, as traditional spatially explicit
ecological models have been forced to do (because of the complexity
otherwise encountered) goes against the spirit of this veridicality
requirement.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-99" name="99">99.</a> See, for example,
Taylor (2005) which is an inter-disciplinary attempt to understand
complexity in ecology.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-100" name="100">100.</a> Sterelny and
Griffiths' (1999) textbook is a notable exception, devoting due space
to ecology.</p>

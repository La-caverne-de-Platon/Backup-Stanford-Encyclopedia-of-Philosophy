 There are two standard ways of interpreting rigid designation, both
of which are consistent with Saul Kripke&rsquo;s original introduction
of the term (1970 lectures, published 1980). On the first
interpretation, a name rigidly designates a given object <em>at every
world in which that object exists</em>, and it fails to designate
anything at worlds in which the object does not exist. On the second
interpretation, a name rigidly designates a given object at every
world <em>regardless of whether the object exists in that world</em>.
For present expository purposes, we&rsquo;ll rely on the latter
interpretation.</p>
</div>

 An object&rsquo;s <em>modal profile</em> or <em>nature</em>, in this
sense, should be distinguished from its essential properties. A modal
profile (or nature) captures all the possible combinations of
properties the object might instantiate in different possible worlds.
In contrast, the object&rsquo;s essential properties are the specific
subset of properties (if any) that the object must have in every world
in which it exists. Standard possible world semantics can be used to
capture the modal profile associated with &lsquo;Roger Federer&rsquo;
by first assigning an intension to the name which maps every possible
world onto a particular individual, RF, and then providing the
resources for determining, of any given predicate, &lsquo;<em class="m">P</em>&rsquo;,
whether there is a possible situation in
which RF exemplifies the property picked out by that predicate. The
complete modal profile of RF can be made explicit by surveying all the
different combinations of properties RF exhibits in the possible
worlds in which he exists.</p>

 This way of representing possible contexts presupposes that the agent
exists at the designated time. This is known as a &ldquo;proper
context&rdquo;, and it reflects the empirical facts available for
interpreting actual utterances. But some theorists work with a weaker
notion of context, which allows for arbitrary combinations of agents,
spatio-temporal locations, and worlds. This weaker notion of context
can help represent how we interpret indexical utterances, like a
recording of &lsquo;I am not here now&rsquo; on an answering machine,
when the agent is not located at the time and place of the utterances
(Predelli 1998).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 The sentence counts as a logical truth in Kaplan&rsquo;s 2D framework
because logical validity is defined only on <em>proper</em> contexts,
in which the designated agent is located at designated time and place
in the world of the context (1989a, 544: clause 10, 547: remark
3).</p>
</div>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 What is the semantic role of the logical operator,
&lsquo;Fixedly&rsquo; (&lsquo;\(\mathcal{F}\)&rsquo;), considered on
its own? Borrowing formalism introduced by (Davies and Humberstone
1980), we can say that a sentence is always evaluated with respect to
an ordered pair of possible worlds, \(\langle w_x, w_y\rangle\), where
the first member of the pair represents the world designated as actual
and the second represents a circumstance of evaluation. A sentence <em class="m">S</em>
is <em>fixedly true at \(w_n\)</em>, iff <em class="m">S</em>
is true with respect to every ordered pair \(\langle
w_x, w_n\rangle\), where we allow the \(w_x\) to vary arbitrarily.
(Graphically, a sentence <em class="m">S</em> will be Fixedly true at
\(w_n\) just in case the entire (vertical) column corresponding to
\(w_n\) in a 2D matrix contains &lsquo;True&rsquo; all the way down.)
In effect, the Fixedly operator tells us about what must be true with
respect to a specific world considered as counterfactual, no matter
which world is designated as actual. When we combine the operators
&lsquo;Fixedly&rsquo; and &lsquo;Actually&rsquo;
(&lsquo;\(\mathcal{F}\mathcal{A}\)&rsquo;), the complex operator
behaves like a <em>necessity operator ranging over possible worlds
playing the actual world role</em>. A sentence is fixedly actually
true just in case it is <em>true at the designated world</em> no
matter which world is so designated. So a sentence is fixedly actually
true iff it is true with respect to every ordered pair \(\langle
w_x,w_x\rangle\), where the value of \(w_x\) is allowed to vary
arbitrarily. (Graphically, <em class="m">S</em> will be fixedly
actually true iff the diagonal of the 2D matrix contains
&lsquo;True&rsquo; all the way down.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Notice that, unlike Kaplan, Crossley and Humberstone do not think of
the possible worlds ranged along the vertical axis of the 2D matrix as
<em>possible contexts of use</em>. On their 2D framework, the worlds
&ldquo;considered as actual&rdquo; are just <em>arbitrarily
designated</em> as the reference of the term &lsquo;actually&rsquo;
for the purposes of modeling the behavior of &lsquo;actually&rsquo;
within the scope of operators like &lsquo;necessarily&rsquo; or
&lsquo;possibly&rsquo;. Thus, their 2D semantics does not explain how
the significance of the natural language expression
&lsquo;actually&rsquo; is affected by the context in which it&rsquo;s
used, only how the term interacts with other modal operators.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 The semantic rules governing &lsquo;actually&rsquo; allow us to know
the definitions given in (i) and (ii) are true no matter which world
is actual (i.e. they are fixedly actually true). According to (i),
<em>whoever</em> invented the zip (whether it was Mary Anne Evans or
Whitcomb Judson), that person is Julius. Since you know that (i) is
true no matter which world is actual, you can know that it&rsquo;s
true on the basis of apriori reasoning alone. But still, (i) does not
reflect the modal profile of Julius: Whitcomb Judson (the real
inventor of the zip) could have died in infancy. So the definition in
(i) does not ensure that the claim is necessary in the sense of the
standard modal operator, &lsquo;\(\Box\)&rsquo;. In contrast, the true
identity claim &lsquo;Julius = Whitcomb Judson&rsquo; is necessary in
this sense, since both names rigidly designate the same individual in
all possible worlds. But the semantic rule in (i) does not allow us to
know this identity is true: we need to conduct some empirical
investigation to find out who the inventor was. Similar observations
follow from the definition of &lsquo;water&rsquo; in (ii).</p>

 Some theorists push the argument further, arguing that the potential
for ignorance and error highlighted by externalist examples
generalizes to other types of expression, such as artifact terms
(&lsquo;pencil&rsquo;, &lsquo;sofa&rsquo;), conventional kinds
(&lsquo;arthritis&rsquo;, &lsquo;fortnight&rsquo;), or even logical
expressions (&lsquo;not&rsquo;, &lsquo;every&rsquo;) (Putnam 1972;
Burge 1979; Williamson 2007).</p>

 Jackson emphasizes that his account of meaning is <em>not</em>
intended to explain thought contents (1998b; 2004). The reason for
this is simple: the account posits implicit conventions that require
individual speakers to associate a word with specific reference-fixing
assumptions about the object, kind or property in question. The
account thus presupposes an independent explanation of the content of
these thoughts. Moreover, it&rsquo;s hard to see how anything like
linguistic conventions could apply to thought contents directly: since
we don&rsquo;t seem to have any way of focusing on our own mental
representations independently of our understanding of their contents,
it&rsquo;s implausible that we could establish conventions requiring
thinkers to associate some pattern of understanding with a given
mental representation.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 It&rsquo;s worth noting that Jackson is not committed to any
particular interpretation of the possible worlds that define his 2D
framework. Jackson&rsquo;s 2D framework is just a tool for testing
one&rsquo;s current understanding of how two different vocabularies
relate to each other, and cataloguing the resulting information in a
perspicuous way. The goal is to identify conditions, specified in some
base vocabulary, that one takes to suffice for the applicability of a
given target expression. For these purposes, <em>any</em> vocabulary
can be used to describe hypothetical cases, as long as it provides
enough information for the speaker to be confident in applying the
target expression. The fact that Jackson sometimes takes the
commitments of a sophisticated proponent of physicalism as his primary
example may obscure this point, suggesting that the possibilities that
define the 2D framework should always be couched in the language of
idealized physics. But it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that the
empiricist theory of meaning is supposed to characterize actual
linguistic competence&mdash;a psychological and social
phenomenon&mdash;not to characterize the nature of reality. So, in
contrast to the rationalist project, the empiricist project
needn&rsquo;t posit an idealized vocabulary that can exhaustively
specify all possible worlds.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 It&rsquo;s worth noting that indirect reference-fixing is also
possible when the nature of the reference can be discovered through
apriori reflection&mdash;and in such cases the difference between
reference-fixing criteria and theoretical criteria will not correspond
to different A- and C-intentions. Jackson and Pettit&rsquo;s
&lsquo;moral functionalism&rsquo; is a case in point: the reference of
moral terms is allegedly fixed by a variety of superficial properties
(e.g. killing is normally wrong, people are normally motivated to do
what they judge right, etc), but these properties do not constitute
the ultimate theoretical characterization of the properties picked out
by moral terms. The fact that you don&rsquo;t realize that your term
&lsquo;morally right&rsquo; picks out a rule-utilitarian property
(let&rsquo;s say) may be due to a failure of apriori reflection rather
than lack of empirical knowledge of your environment (Jackson 1998a,
ch. 5 &amp; 6; Jackson and Pettit 1995).</p>
</div>

 N.B., the rationalist is not committed to the idea that a 2D semantic
framework accounts for <em>all</em> aspects of meaning: in particular,
further aspects of meaning may be required to account for differences
in content between apriori equivalent claims. See the discussion of
semantic pluralism in 2.3.3 below.</p>

 According to a modal rationalist like Chalmers, the primary job of
modal notions like <em>possibility</em> and <em>necessity</em> is to
keep track of apriori consistency relations among semantic contents.
To fulfill this explanatory role, the rationalist posits a
&ldquo;logically possible world&rdquo; for every apriori conceivable
way the world might be. Chalmers thinks that critics of modal
rationalism should concede (i) that this notion of logical possibility
is an important and useful one for keeping track of consistency among
thought contents and (ii) that <em>at least some</em> logical
possibilities represent genuine metaphysical possibilities. The debate
over the truth of modal rationalism would then hinge on whether
<em>every</em> logically possible world is also metaphysically
possible. Put graphically: is the space of metaphysically possible
worlds a proper subset of the space of logically possible worlds?
Chalmers argues that any way of demarcating metaphysical from logical
possibilities would constitute &ldquo;an <em>ad hoc</em> proliferation
of modalities&rdquo; which posited a second &ldquo;brute and
inexplicable&rdquo; modal primitive. So we should accept a single
space of possibility, in which every apriori coherent hypothesis
represents a genuine metaphysical possibility (1996, 136&shy;-8; 1999,
488&ndash;91).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

 Chalmers introduces the term &lsquo;1-intension&rsquo; as a way of
talking about the various different kinds of intension that correspond
to the diagonal of a 2D framework. Strictly speaking, therefore, it
makes no sense to talk about <em>the</em> 1-intension of a particular
expression without further ado, since the notion of a 1-intension is
defined purely in terms of the formalism. To obtain a specific
1-intension for an expression, we need to <em>interpret</em> the 2D
framework by specifying the possibilities relative to which extensions
are assigned and explaining the principles for assigning extensions.
Chalmers&rsquo; Core Thesis doesn&rsquo;t appeal to any specific
interpretation of the 2D formalism, instead it is intended as a
constraint on how the framework should be interpreted if it is to
vindicate the rationalist conception of meaning. (Similarly, Chalmers
introduces the term &lsquo;2-intension&rsquo; to pick out <em>the
first horizontal row</em> of a 2D matrix, regardless of how exactly
the 2D formalism is interpreted. In any 2D framework, the first row
assigns an intension relative to the actual world considered as
actual. So an expression&rsquo;s 2-intension will correspond to the
kind of intension posited by standard possible world semantics.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Chalmers notes a further dialectical problem in appealing to
contextualist 2D semantics to vindicate rationalism (2004, 2006a). In
order to generate a 1-intension, a contextualist must specify which
properties of an utterance are held fixed in every possible context of
use. Very different contextual 1-intensions will be generated for your
term &lsquo;I&rsquo;, for instance, depending on whether we require
that the target utterance of &lsquo;I&rsquo; be <em>spelled</em> a
certain way in every context or if we instead require that it be
<em>understood</em> a certain way by the agent of the context. A
contextualist 1-intension based on spelling will not capture any
interesting notion of meaning: depending on how it&rsquo;s used and
understood in a context, the string &lsquo;I&rsquo; may pick out
apples, Antarctica, arguments, or anything else. So if contextualist
1-intensions are to capture a kind of meaning, we will need some
independent way of identifying those properties of an expression that,
if held fixed, guarantee sameness of meaning. In the case of
indexicals like &lsquo;I&rsquo; this requirement is not too onerous,
since there are conventional linguistic rules for identifying the
extension in a context that all competent speakers readily
acknowledge. But in the case of names or natural kind terms, it is
highly controversial whether there are any conventional linguistic
rules, except the aposteriori rules that link these expressions
directly to their 2-intensions. So contextualist 2D semantics by
itself does nothing to allay skepticism about the existence of
rationalist meanings for expressions like names and natural kind
terms.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 Chalmers leaves the door open for weaker ways of understanding
epistemic possibility. For instance, he suggests that one might define
epistemic possibilities in terms of whether a sentence (or set of
sentences) seems coherent after a specified amount of &ldquo;cognitive
work&rdquo;. However, Chalmers takes the notion of ideal apriori
coherence to be the most principled sense of epistemic possibility,
and the one that underwrites our access to metaphysical modality
(2002b).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Chalmers is neutral about a more substantive analysis of scenarios.
He sketches three different approaches: (i) scenarios might be
identified with centered possible worlds, (ii) scenarios might be
identified with sets of apriori coherent sentences in an idealized
language, or (iii) scenarios might be taken as epistemic primitives.
As a modal rationalist, he takes these analyses to be extensionally
equivalent, but he argues that the different options have important
consequences for how the 2D framework is elaborated (2004, 2006a).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 It&rsquo;s worth noting that there are other ways of interpreting an
E2D framework defined on epistemic and metaphysical possibilities,
which do not support Chalmers&rsquo; rationalist program. Some
advocates of E2D have suggested that we have <em>defeasible</em>,
rather than <em>conclusive</em> apriori access to application
conditionals (Kipper 2012, 39&ndash;40; Biggs and Wilson 2020, 69). But as
Wittmer (2013) points out, defeasible judgments will not suffice to
fix the semantic facts about 1-intensions. So these interpretations
must be construed as accounts of our epistemic access to independently
determined semantic facts. Other theorists take scenarios to be a
space of objective metaphysical possibilities, which need not be
epistemically transparent to individuals. Wolfgang Spohn, for
instance, likens scenarios to concrete universes, and he takes
counterfactual metaphysical possibilities to be constructed from
descriptions of such universes (Spohn 2016). The result is a
pragmatist approach to G2D that is ill suited to Chalmers&rsquo;
rationalist E2D project.</p>

 The Fregean triviality test is not exactly the same as apriori
equivalence: cognitive significance marks what&rsquo;s obvious to a
subject at a given time, whereas apriori equivalence is often far from
obvious. Mathematical identities like &lsquo;\(12^3 = 1728\)&rsquo;
are a clear case where the two notions come apart. Still, Chalmers
argues that apriori equivalence is a well-behaved theoretical
refinement of the Fregean notion. He also suggests that the 2D
framework might capture something close to the Fregean notion of
triviality if we substitute a weaker epistemic relation for
&lsquo;apriori coherence&rsquo; in defining the epistemic framework
(Chalmers 2002b).</p>

 The word &lsquo;concept&rsquo; here is not meant to imply that these
matrices reflect stable semantic units of thought&mdash;it is merely
meant to suggest that they reflect some aspect of the subject&rsquo;s
current understanding. Stalnaker rejects concepts as theoretical
entities that reflect stable units of cognitive significance in
thought (1984).</p>

 On Stalnaker&rsquo;s account, to determine just which proposition is
ascribed by a particular belief report, we must answer three
questions. First, how should we characterize the possible worlds that
define propositional concepts: which objects, kinds, or properties
should we invoke in describing the different ways the world might be?
Second, which possible worlds so characterized should we treat as
members of the context set for the belief ascription? Third, which
aspects of the <em>attributor&rsquo;s</em> understanding should we
hold constant in evaluating her report in those different worlds
considered as contexts of use? These factors determine the content of
the diagonal proposition attributed to the believer.</p>

 There is a further way in which the interests of an interpreter are
taken into account on Stalnaker&rsquo;s approach. Whereas a
rationalist 2D theorist like Chalmers will invoke a single space of
apriori possible scenarios to define 2D matrices, Stalnaker&rsquo;s
externalist commitments lead him to deny that we can exhaustively
characterize the space of metaphysical possibility in a descriptive
vocabulary that&rsquo;s devoid of any empirical presuppositions. Since
there is no privileged way of describing the space of possibility, the
explanatory interests and presuppositions of the theorist will affect
just what objects, kinds or properties she uses to individuate the
possible worlds that define 2D matrices:</p>

<blockquote>
It might be nice if we had a neutral language with an internally
grounded semantics, a language that required no factual assumptions
for its interpretation and that could provide a complete description
of the world, and of all possible worlds. It might be nice if there
were a pure epistemic space to which we had apriori access and in
terms of which we could locate our disagreements about what the actual
world is like. But I don&rsquo;t think these things are possible. The
only way we can describe the world is to use the materials that the
actual world offers us&mdash;the things, properties and relations that
we find there. (Stalnaker 2004, 319)

<h3>Notes to <a href="supplement.html">The 2D Argument Against Materialism</a></h3>

<div id="note-25"><p>

 <a href="supplement.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 Chalmers argues that establishing the stability of phenomenal terms
like &lsquo;pain&rsquo; is not really essential to establishing his
anti-materialist conclusion (1996, 2009). His idea is that the
<em>epistemic 1-intension</em> for &lsquo;pain&rsquo; itself
corresponds to a property&mdash;call it &lsquo;diagonal
pain&rsquo;&mdash;that does not supervene on the physical properties
of the actual world. Diagonal pain \(is\) instantiated in the actual
world and it is <em>not</em> instantiated in the scenario that, if
actual, would make \((P \amp \neg Q)\) true. Given that there is a
metaphysically possible world for every coherent scenario (premise 4),
there will be a possible world just like ours physically but without
diagonal pain. Since the actual world has a property&mdash;diagonal
pain&mdash;that doesn&rsquo;t supervene on the physical, it follows
that materialism is false.</p></div>

<div id="note-26"><p>

 <a href="supplement.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 Chalmers in fact believes that phenomenal terms are stable, but he is
less confident of the semantic stability of microphysical predicates
like &lsquo;is a quark&rsquo;: perhaps different intrinsic properties
are picked out depending on what the actual world is like. To allow
for this possibility, Chalmers weakens the conclusion of his argument:
either materialism is false or phenomenal properties are determined by
the intrinsic nature of basic physical properties (Chalmers 2009). As
Chalmers emphasizes, most materialists will reject even this weaker
conclusion, since it denies that phenomenal properties can be
explained by the structural and causal properties studied by the
physical sciences.</p></div>

<div id="note-27"><p>

 <a href="supplement.html#ref-27">27.</a>
 Chalmers (2009, &sect;5) replies that the criticism misfires because
it targets the apriori coherence of an explicitly modal claim,
\(\Diamond(P \amp \neg Q)\), rather than the apriori coherence of \((P
\amp \neg Q)\).</p></div>

<h3>Notes to <a href="objections-2d.html">Objections to Generalized 2D Semantics</a></h3>

<div id="note-28"><p>

 <a href="objections-2d.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 It&rsquo;s worth noting that a 2D empiricist is <em>not</em>
committed to the rationalist&rsquo;s Core Thesis. The empiricist
project is to explain how speakers manage to coordinate their
reference-fixing criteria through implicit conventions. For these
purposes, there is no need to insist that 1-intensions must be defined
for worlds with no thought or language: we may have no interest in
deciding how to apply terms in situations in which we ourselves
don&rsquo;t exist. It is the rationalist project of linking meaning to
the space of apriori coherent scenarios that gives rise to the Core
Thesis.</p></div>

<h3>Notes to <a href="objections-meta.html">Objections to the Metasemantic Interpretation</a></h3>

<div id="note-29"><p>

 <a href="objections-meta.html#ref-29">29.</a>
 Stalnaker&rsquo;s initial response to proponents of finer-grained
propositional structure is to insist that possible world semantics
provides a <em>minimal</em> kind of content that all theorists should
accept (1984, 1999b). Stalnaker&rsquo;s context-sensitive use of the
2D framework is intended to provide a flexible framework for
explaining commonsense intuitions about logical equivalence and <em>de
re</em> thought. And self-locating aspects of thought, according to
Stalnaker, should not be considered an aspect of propositional
contents, but rather part of one&rsquo;s epistemic <em>relation</em>
to a propositional content (Stalnaker 2006).</p></div>

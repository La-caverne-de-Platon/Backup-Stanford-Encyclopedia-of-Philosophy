<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Innateness and Language</a></h2>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>
 This paper assumes that linguistic competence involves syntactic 
knowledge of some kind. See, however, Devitt 2006 for an intriguing 
argument that no representation of syntactic knowledge is involved in
being able to speak and understand a language.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>
 Terminological Note: In this article, I will use &lsquo;innate&rsquo;
and &lsquo;inborn&rsquo; as synonyms; such usage is typical in the 
literature on linguistic nativism. As many have pointed out, however,
these terms cannot generally be treated as synonymous in the 
philosophical literature on innateness (See, e.g., Cowie, 1999, 
chs.1-3; Elman et al., 1996; Griffiths, 2002; Wimsatt, 1999.)</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>
 Assuming, of couse, that speakers <em>have</em> knowledge about their
language &mdash; again, see Devitt 2006 for arguments that speakers 
do <em>not</em> have knowledge of grammar, and that whatever 
knowledge they <em>do</em> have about language plays no role in 
language production or comprehension. Devitt Ch. 5 explores the 
implications of this radical view for linguistic nativism.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>
 The question seems pressing even if one assumes, as most linguists in
fact do, that incoming sentences are subject to a certain amount of 
analysis or preprocessing before being used as evidence for language 
learning. For instance, suppose (with Chomsky 1965) that the evidence
used by language learners (the <em>pld</em>) were so rich as to 
include &lsquo;a partial and tentative pairing of signals with 
structural descriptions&rsquo; (1965:32). The question still remains 
how learners could figure out (i) whether that &lsquo;tentative 
pairing&rsquo; was correct and (ii) what the <em>rules</em> governing
utterances with those sorts of structural descriptions are. (Not to 
mention how they are able to perform the relevant analysis or 
preprocessing of the noises hitting their eardrums.)</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>
 See, e.g., Chomsky, 1975:30-33; 1986:7-13</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>
 An asterix (*) before a sentence indicates that it is ungrammatical 
or ill-formed.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
 Tomasello stresses that the kind of distributional analysis at issue 
here is <em>functionally-based.</em> The learner does not merely keep
track of the frequencies with which a given word or phrase occurs in 
different <em>syntactic</em> contexts; instead, she is concerned to 
analyze the <em>communicative functions</em> associated with 
particular elements: elements are grouped together on the basis of 
their playing similar communicative roles. More adult-like syntactic 
categories emerge only later, and very gradually, as a result of 
additional analysis. Chomsky (1957) argued that distributional 
analyses cannot give rise to knowledge of grammar, as there are not 
enough &lsquo;minimally differing&rsquo; sentences in the input to 
enable children to figure out what the allowable contexts for a given
element are. In stressing the role of (broadly) semantic information 
in childrens' analyses, Tomasello seeks to avoid these kinds of 
problems. (He also points out, however, that empirical studies of 
speech directed at children show large amounts of repetition, of the 
sort that ordinary distibrutional analysis could exploit &mdash; 
e.g., children hear around 5,000-7,000 utterances per day, and around
45% of mothers' utterances to young begin with one of just 17 words, 
like <em>What&hellip;, That</em>&hellip;, and <em>You&hellip;.</em> 
Tomasello, 2003: 110-111 and ff.)</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>
 Pullum and Scholz, as they admit, are vulnerable to this objection, 
as their data are taken from corpora like the <em>Wall Street 
Journal</em>. Sampson, however, is not: his corpus enables him to 
estimate that even &ldquo;linguistically deprived three year 
olds&rdquo; (2002:78) hear a complex auxiliary about every other day.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>
 In this connection, it is worth noting that according to Tomasello 
(2004), children tend to learn question forms in a very piecemeal 
way, as formulas tied to particular communicative situations, like 
<em>Where's THING? Can I ACTION? Is it PROPERTY?</em> Etc. A child 
may thus use the formula <em>Is it F?</em> quite correctly and 
productively, yet consistently produce errors like <em>Are the clouds
are moving?</em> This suggests that they do not, contra Chomsky, hit 
unerringly upon the correct, general rule. (Tomasello 2003:158-9).</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>
 For critical discussion of the one theory that does supply a linking 
mechanism, that of Pinker (1984, 1987, 1989) see Tomasello 
(2004:184-5).</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>
 Cf Pinker 1994:12: &ldquo;[When the Head parameter is set] huge 
chunks of grammar are then available to the child, all at once, as if
the child were merely flipping a switch.&rdquo; For further 
discussion, see Cowie 1999, &sect;&sect;10.5, 10.6.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>
 To be sure, Chomsky has often claimed that all speakers of a given 
language acquire the <em>same</em> grammar. However, he is quite 
explicit that this is an idealization made to simplify both one's 
account of learning and the task of grammar construction. It's clear,
however, that abstracting away from individual differences for some 
purposes does not make those differences go away.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>
 The learnability literature has explored the possibility of making 
various of these assumptions. Surveying this literature is beyond our
scope (and probably beyond me). My sense is that as learners are 
endowed with different kinds of learning algorithms, particularly 
ones that regard confirmation probabilistically and sample data 
statistically, the Unlearning problem disappears (or perhaps, 
disappears &lsquo;in the limit).&rsquo; For more information and 
references, see the entry on 
 <a href="../learning-formal/index.html">formal learning theory</a>.
 </p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>
 It's perhaps worth reiterating here that <em>all</em> theories of 
language acquisition suppose that learners are able to perform some 
kind of structural analysis of the data. E.g., as mentioned above 
(&sect;2.2.1(d)), a learner of Spanish setting the head parameter to 
&lsquo;Heads optional&rsquo; must be able to tell that she has, in 
fact, encountered a sentence that lacks a Head. The point here is 
that such analyses can be exploited as a means of bringing data to 
bear on whole classes of sentences.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>
 Tomasello discusses this method under the name of 
&lsquo;pre-emption&rsquo; in his (2004:178ff). See also Cowie 1997.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>
 Thanks to Jim Woodward for this example. At this point, it is perhaps
appropriate to mention the oft-misinterpreted results in formal 
learning theory which are held to show that languages are not 
learnable from positive instances (or &lsquo;text&rsquo;). Gold, 1967
showed that under certain assumptions about the learning algorithm 
and the class of natural languages, the latter are not learnable (in 
the sense of &lsquo;identifiable in the limit&rsquo;) from text. 
However, more recent results have shown that under different (and in 
many ways more plausible) assumptions about the learning algorithm, 
the class of natural languages and the correct criterion for 
learnability, natural languages are learnable from text. See Jain et 
al. 1999, Feldman, 1972 and Shinohara, 1994.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>
 Cf. Baker, 1979; Lasnik; 1989:89-90; Pinker, 1989.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>
 See Skyrms, 2002 for more on this point.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a>
 This is true of 96% of right-handers and approx. 70% of left-handers.
(Saffran, 2000:410)</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>
 Ocular dominance columns are groups of connected neurons in the 
visual cortex, organized into columns lying perpendicular to the 
cortical surface. While most columns respond to input from both eyes,
most also respond more strongly to inputs from one eye rather than 
the other. In addition, columns have &lsquo;preferred&rsquo; stimuli 
(e.g., bars of light at a particular orientation) to which they 
respond most strongly; these preferences change gradually across the 
cortex, giving rise to a &lsquo;map&rsquo; of the visual field.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>
 Note that everything is now known to be much more complicated than 
this, with many factors influencing both the outcome of occular 
deprivation and the possibility of recovery. See Katz et al., 2000 
and Elbert et al., 2001 for surveys.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>
 Of interest in this connection is the debate within the SLA 
literature about the degree of &lsquo;access&rsquo; to UG enjoyed by 
second language learners. Some prominent researchers argue that UG is
fully accessible to second language learners, and that it constrains 
SLA in much the same way as it constrains first language learning 
(see White, 2003; Epstein, Flynn and Martohardjono, 1996, Epstein, 
1998). However others (e.g., Kellerman (e.g., Kellerman and Yoshioka,
1999 and Kellerman et al., 1999) argue that UG only influences SLA to
the extent that its principles are implicit in the native language 
grammar and still others (e.g., Clahsen and Muysken, 1986) argue that
SLA is not constrained by UG at all. (For an overview, see Sharwood 
Smith, 143-171.) While further discussion of these issues is beyond 
the scope of this paper, it is worth pointing out that if either of 
the latter views turn out to be true, then it would appear that to 
the extent that it succeeds and does not rely on explicit training 
(itself a controversial issue), SLA can succeed <em>without</em> 
innate knowledge of UG (or without <em>full</em> knowledge of UG). 
This raises the obvious question: if people can learn a second 
language without knowledge of UG, why not a first language too?</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a>
 Elbert et al., 2001 and Kuhl, 2000 stress that adults <em>can</em> 
learn to speak a second language (L2) without accent, especially when
trained with suitable techniques (e.g., those minimizing the effects 
of memory and stressing feedback). Based on their studies of the 
superior efficacy of &lsquo;behaviorally relevant&rsquo; training in 
restoring lost functions in lower animals, Elbert et al. attribute 
the generally non-native-like outcomes of adult L2 learning to the 
fact that they just don't care very much about their accent. However 
this of course begs the question of why children <em>do</em> care 
&mdash; or, perhaps, of why it doesn't matter whether they care or 
not.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a>
 Although training helps: Bradlow et al. 1997.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a>
 This may in part be a consequence of prenatal learning. DeCaspar and 
Spence, 1986.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a>
 Thanks to Jim Woodward for this point.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a>
 Topicalization is a device whereby the hearer's attention is focused 
on the occupier of a certain role. In English moving a constituent to
the beginning of the sentence and/or stressing it is a way to 
topicalize that constituent, as in <em>Chardonnay I love, but 
champagne I adore.</em> In ASL, elements are topicalized by being 
moved to the beginning of the sentence and accompanied by a special 
facial expression lasting as long as that element takes to sign.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a>
 Although significantly lower than that of their relatives, the 
affected KE's nonverbal IQ is still close to the population average, 
hence the diagnosis of SLI still applies.</p>

<p>


 <a href="index-2.html#note-29" name="29">29.</a>
 I owe the point about the monolithic simplicity of the nativist's 
theory to Peter Godfrey-Smith.</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Determinables and Determinates</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
One might wonder if (as Johansson [2000] maintains) these relations
also differ in that the genus/species relation applies to substances,
whereas determination applies to properties; but if there is a
distinction here, it isn&rsquo;t deep, since the relata in both cases
are (in the first instance) properties (<em>animal</em>, <em>rational
animal</em>; <em>color</em>, <em>red</em>) instantiated in particulars
(substances); nor do there appear to be in-principle barriers to taking
determination to be a relation between objects, events, or other
particulars (see &sect;2.2).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 See also Cook Wilson (1915), who prefigures this point.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Johnson here relies on a number of assumptions, including that the
sharing of determinables would be like the sharing of parts, and that
parthood conforms to weak supplementation, whereby subtracting
determinable from determinate leaves an independent
property&mdash;contra the usual assumption that determination is
non-conjunctive. Against this line of thought one might maintain
either that parthood needn&rsquo;t be seen as obeying weak
supplementation (or its conjunctive correlate) or that shared
determinables needn&rsquo;t be seen as shared parts.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 These features are motivated by the previous historical survey; see
Johnson (1921: Vol I, Ch IX), Armstrong (1997: 48&ndash;49),
Funkhouser (2006: 548&ndash;9), and Sanford (2014) for similar
presentations.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 This sort of increase in specificity is in contrast to, e.g., the
increase in specificity associated with <em>being in Chicago</em> and
<em>being happy and in Chicago</em>; see features
 <a href="index-2.html#feature6">6</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#feature7">7</a>.</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 The principle also ensures the incompatibility of, e.g., <em>red</em>
and <em>navy</em>, since an object&rsquo;s being navy entails its
being blue, and as per <em>Determinate incompatibility</em>,
<em>red</em> and <em>blue</em> are incompatible.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Compare the incompatibility of <em>red</em> and <em>blue</em> with
that of <em>red</em> and <em>prime</em> (Elder 1996).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Note that the relativization to perspective here is not just a matter
of seeing different parts of the feather; the latter phenomenon in
itself would not support taking the relativization at issue to be
indicative of multiple relativized determination <em>per se</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 As Poli (2004) observes, while Johnson&rsquo;s discussion is pitched in
terms of different kinds of &ldquo;adjectives&rdquo; as applied to
&ldquo;substantives&rdquo;, nonetheless &ldquo;Johnson reclassifies
linguistic data on the basis of ontological distinctions&rdquo; (Poli 2004:
167).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Though see Mulligan (2006, 2014: sec. 9.2.2), who maintains that
determination is not appropriately applied to certain formal
concepts&mdash;e.g., negation.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 For example, realists about determinable properties may take these to
be either universals (as per Fales 1990; Armstrong 1997; Elder 1996;
Johansson 2004) or tropes (as discussed in Mulligan 1992 and Bacon
1995 and as endorsed in Brentano, Descriptive Psychology, Segelberg 1999, and Funkhouser 2006).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 For example, in response to Johansson&rsquo;s claim that in viewing a
patterned colored object, &ldquo;There is, as a kind of background, a
strictly identical something throughout the whole pattern: the color
determinable&rdquo; (2000: sec. 6), Massin says, &ldquo;It seems to
me, on the contrary, that we fail to experience any strictly identical
features when we perceive a pattern of colours&rdquo; (2013: 397).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 That said (as Massin observed; p.c.) given that there are typically
many levels of determination associated with a given determinable, it
also remains to explain why we do not see &ldquo;layers&rdquo; of,
e.g., colocated color determinables.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 Moreover, in their discussions, both Armstrong and French maintain
that the fundamental determinable features at issue are irreducible to
determinate features, though not for reasons that are appropriately
deemed <em>prima facie</em>
 (<a href="index-2.html#LawsNatuNomoModa">see &sect;5.1</a>).</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 Beyond general considerations about scientific ontology, laws, and
explanation, there are cases to be made that irreducible determinables
are needed to accommodate the value indeterminacy associated with
certain interpretations of quantum mechanics, as well as the
boundaries of field-theoretic particles constituted by fundamental
interactions shading off to infinity
 (<a href="index-2.html#MetaInde">see &sect;5.3</a>).</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
Though
common, the supposition that reality is (fundamentally and entirely)
maximally precise can be challenged&mdash;for example, by, e.g., the
scientific considerations discussed above (see also the discussion of
metaphysical indeterminacy in
 <a href="index-2.html#MetaInde">&sect;5.3</a>).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 But see &sect;4.2.</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 As Gillett and Rives say: &ldquo;[M]any philosophers [&hellip;]
accept what Armstrong calls the &lsquo;Eleatic Principle&rsquo;
[stating:] Everything that exists makes a difference to the causal
powers of something. (Armstrong 1997: 41&ndash;2). If determinable
properties do not contribute causal powers to individuals, nor
otherwise determine such powers, then it appears that they fail the
Eleatic Principle and hence do not exist&rdquo; (2005: 487).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 This concern is a special case of Kim&rsquo;s (1989, 1993, and
elsewhere) exclusion argument against irreducible higher-level
properties. While Kim takes overdetermination concerns to motivate
reductionism about higher-level features, others (e.g., Heil 2003 and
Gillett and Rives 2005) see these as motivating anti-realism about
determinables, on grounds that determinables cannot be reduced,
metaphysically or conceptually, to any constructions from or of
determinates. See Christensen (2014) for a response to the
overdetermination concern according to which overdetermination of
powers is pervasive, and hence not a particular problem for the posit
of determinables.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 The concern may be partly inspired by certain attempts to
characterize determination as non-conjunctive, as in Stout&rsquo;s
claim: &ldquo;the point is that red and yellow do not resemble each
other in one character and differ in another. The respect in which
they are alike, i.e. colour, is also the respect in which they are
dissimilar&rdquo; (1930: 398).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 As Berkeley said: &ldquo;[I]t is thought that every name has, or
ought to have, only one precise and settled signification, which
inclines men to think there are certain <em>abstract</em>,
<em>determinate</em> ideas, which constitute the true and only
immediate signification of each general name. [&hellip;] whereas, in
truth, there is no such thing as one precise and definite
signification annexed to any general name, they all signifying
indifferently a great number of particular ideas&rdquo; (1710:
&sect;18).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 Berkeley&rsquo;s arguments against abstract ideas might be seen as
suggesting another reason to reject determinables: namely, that we are
unable to think about them (contra, e.g., G. F. Stout's (1930) view that we can think of colour without thinking of some special
colour); see
van der Schaar (1991: 156) and Poli (2004: 179) for discussion).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 As Searle puts it: &ldquo;We invent a term (e.g.,
&lsquo;color&rsquo;, &lsquo;texture&rsquo;, &lsquo;shape&rsquo;) to
cover a whole range of characterising terms which are all in the same
line of business. But this higher order term (determinable) is not
part of an analysis of the lower order terms, it is just a name for
the line of business they are all in&rdquo; (1959: 154).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
 Armstrong allows that &ldquo;it remains possible that <em>some</em>
of these classes are unified in a more direct manner [involving] a
determinable property&rdquo; (1997: 52), and later suggests that this
is the case for determinable predicates appearing in functional laws
of nature
 (<a href="index-2.html#LawsNatuNomoModa">see &sect;5.1</a>);
 this (temporary) exception aside, Armstrong is anti-realist about
determinables.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
 See, e.g., Fales (1990), who argues that Armstrong&rsquo;s account can only handle
linearly orderable determinates, and Eddon (2007), who argues that the account also
fails for certain fundamental physical quantities. See Armstrong
(1997) and Morganti (2011) for responses.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
 As a referee pointed out, further determinability does not follow
just from the continuity of space; for if space is ultimately
constituted by points, there could nonetheless be a maximally
determinate shape given by the pattern of occupation of points.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>
 Antony qualifies: &ldquo;What I really think is that there is no such
thing as a &lsquo;disjunctive property&rsquo;&mdash;rather, there are
only disjunctive <em>predicates</em>&rdquo; (2003: 9); hence she might
better be seen as an eliminativist with a disjunctive conception of
determinable predicates.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>
 In Yablo&rsquo;s account there is a particularist echo of
Fales&rsquo;s account of &ldquo;causal essences&rdquo; as determinable
or generic universals which are contained within the essences of
specific universals.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>
 As a referee noted, one might think that even if red and orange share
certain powers, red and blue might share other powers&mdash;say, being
able to trigger a machine designed to detect for those shades. Here
the proponent of a powers-based account might respond that such
artificial powers are not clearly to the point of accommodating
seemingly orderable similarities between determinates.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>
 Fales (1990: Ch. 9.3) suggests that <em>Requisite determination</em>
may be explained if the subset of causal relations/powers associated
with the determinable is nomologically insufficient for distinct
existence.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-31">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a>
 See, however, Jenkins (2011), Schaffer (2012), Wilson (2014), Rodriguez-Pereyra (2016), and
others for arguments that metaphysical dependence needn&rsquo;t be a
strict partial order.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-32">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-32">32.</a>
 Funkhouser (2006) seems to presuppose that determinables should be
disjunctively understood; see 566, note 2.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-33">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-33">33.</a>
 A particular \(a\) falls under \(F\) iff \(F\) is a determinable
\(\langle S, f\rangle\) and \(a\) is in the domain of \(f\); a
particular \(a\) instantiates \(F\) iff \(F\) is a determinate
\(\langle \langle S, f\rangle , Ei\rangle \) and \(f(a) = i\).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-34">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-34">34.</a>
 A particular instantiates a determinate \(\langle \langle S, f\rangle
, Ei\rangle \) iff it is mapped by \(f\) to the point \(i\) in the
metric space \(S\) encoded by determinable \(\langle S, f\rangle \).
To instantiate more than one determinate of that determinable, a
particular would have to be mapped to more than one such point. This
cannot happen, however, since \(f\) is a function.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-35">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-35">35.</a>
 Each determinate is associated with a specific point in the metric
space encoded by its determinable; but a metric space also encodes a
distance relation among its points. Hence we say that a determinate
\(\langle \langle S, f\rangle , Ei\rangle \) is more similar to
determinate \(\langle \langle S, f\rangle , Ej\rangle \) than it is to
determinate \(\langle \langle S, f\rangle , Ek\rangle \) iff \(d(i,j)
\langle d(i, k)\), where \(d\) is the distance relation encoded by
\(S\).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-36">

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-36">36.</a>
 Fine&rsquo;s approach to characterizing determinable-determinate
structure takes as primitive a &lsquo;part-whole&rsquo; relation on
possible states, where which states can &lsquo;fuse&rsquo; is
sensitive to the incompatibility of co-determinates: states are
incompatible just in case there is no whole of which they are both
part. This primitive part-whole relation is used to define the notion
of a state-space: a set of partially ordered states obeying
&lsquo;bounded completeness&rsquo;, according to which any subset with
an upper bound (a state into which states fuse) has a lower upper
bound. Next, an &lsquo;\(R\)-space&rsquo;&mdash;regular space&mdash;is
defined as a state-space satisfying two conditions:
<em>Supplementation</em> (if \(s\) is a proper part of \(t\), then
some non-null part of \(t\) \(u\) is a state which is disjoint from
\(s\)) and <em>Overlap</em> (if the fusion of a set of states \(S\)
exists and overlaps with state \(t\), then some member of \(S\)
overlaps with state \(t\)). A
&lsquo;\(D\)-space&rsquo;&mdash;determinate space&mdash;is then
defined as an \(R\)-space satisfying two further conditions:
<em>Directed Completeness</em>, according to which any states that are
pairwise compatible are jointly compatible, and <em>Independence</em>,
according to which if one state is disjoint from and compatible with
another then any state excluded by the first is also compatible with
the second. A \(D\)-space contains a full array of
&lsquo;world-states&rsquo;, corresponding to the possible worlds.</p>

Fine then characterizes the co-determination relation between states,
as follows. First, he defines the &lsquo;occlusion&rsquo; relation,
where state \(t\) occludes state \(s\) just in case every part of
\(s\) overlaps a part of \(t\) or cannot fuse with any part of \(t\).
Next, he defines the &lsquo;coincidence&rsquo; relation, which holds
between states that mutually occlude each other; as Fine says,
&ldquo;this corresponds, intuitively speaking, to two states being
determinates of the same determinable&rdquo; (2011: 163). For example,
the state of being red on the left and round is coincident
with&mdash;is a codeterminate state of&mdash;the state of being green
on the left and round. Under the conditions of a \(D\)-space, the
coincidence/co-determinate relation is an equivalence relation, which
can be used to define state determinables [\(s\)], where, e.g., the
color of a particular patch would be the equivalence class containing
the state of the patch&rsquo;s being red, the state of the
patch&rsquo;s being green, and so on. More complex state
determinables would reflect equivalence classes of fused
states&mdash;e.g., the color-shape of a particular patch would be the
equivalence class containing the state of the patch&rsquo;s being red
and round, the state of the patch&rsquo;s being green and round, the
state of the patch&rsquo;s being red and square, and so on.</p>

<p>
Logical space sensitive to determinable/determinate structure is then
the space of equivalence classes under the coincidence/co-determinate
relation, where the classes are ordered by a derived part-whole
relation, according to which region [\(s\)] is part of region [\(t\)]
only if for some state in [\(s\)] and some state in [\(t\)], the first
is part of the second. Effectively, logical space is the homomorphic
image of \(D\)-space under the coincidence relation. Determinables are
regions of logical space, and what it is to have a determinable is to
have some state in the region.</p>

<p>
One concern with Fine&rsquo;s approach is that, while advertised as
&lsquo;abstract&rsquo;, it relies on controversial ontological
assumptions. To start, while <em>Directed Completeness</em>
accommodates <em>Non-disjunctive specification</em>, it does this by
ruling out there being any disjunctive states; as Fine says,
&ldquo;Directed Completeness is meant to exclude disjunctive or
non-determinate states&rdquo; (2011: 168), but one might want to allow
disjunctive states even if one doesn&rsquo;t want to identify
determinables with such states. Moreover, the assumption that states
obey <em>Supplementation</em>&mdash;a condition which Fine says is
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
especially plausible for &lsquo;determinate&rsquo; states [&hellip;]
if \(s\) and \(t\) are states, with \(s\) a proper part of \(t\), then
there must be a part of \(t\) that is left over once one
&lsquo;subtracts&rsquo; \(s\) (2011: 165) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&mdash;rules out that determinables can be constitutionally shared by
determinates in a way accommodating <em>Non-conjunctive
specification</em>.</p>

<p>
Two further concerns reflect certain limits of Fine&rsquo;s account.
First, his characterization of determinables as equivalence classes of
co-determinate states does not accommodate determination as holding
between properties, notwithstanding that these are the paradigmatic
relata of determination; at best it characterizes state determinables
(e.g., an equivalence class of incompatible states pertaining to the
color of a given patch). Second, Fine&rsquo;s account does not have
resources for articulating structure associated with distinct levels
of determination; in the case of color, for example, the view has
resources to characterize the determinable <em>color</em> (as the
equivalence class of all coincident&mdash;mutually
occluding&mdash;states), but not the determinable <em>red</em>.</p>

 As Massin observes, on disjunctivism, &ldquo;determinates are more

 To start, no determinate instance seems suited to ground such a
constitutive modal fact. Nor does any more complex determinate
property&mdash;e.g., a disjunction or mereological sum of
determinates&mdash;provide a ground for such a fact; for even if such
disjunctive or other complex combinations of determinates can could do
so, such combinations are logically or metaphysically gerrymandered,
and so by lights of a &lsquo;naturalness&rsquo; criterion are less
fundamental than the determinable capable of grounding such a
constitutive modal fact in non-gerrymandered fashion.</p>

 Other applications that I do not have space to treat here include the
view (endorsed in Hurley 1992 and Tappolet 2004, with some qualifications) that
thick moral values are determinates of thin moral values rather than
(as on the &lsquo;two-components&rsquo;&rsquo; analysis) species of
thin moral values, and the &lsquo;proportionality strategy&rsquo; for
responding to the problem of profligate omissions (endorsed by Dowe
[2010] and rejected by Bernstein [2014]), which &ldquo;employs the
determinate/determinable relationship to restrict which among many
putative causes is the cause&rdquo; (Bernstein 2014: 429).</p>

 More specifically, Kistler argues, by attention to the ideal gas law
\(T = P V /nR\) (\(T\) being temperature, \(P\) pressure, \(V\) the
volume occupied by the gas, <em>n</em> the number of moles, and \(R\)
the universal gas constant), that it is plausible to take \(T\) and
\(P\) to be two determinables with respect to the same set \(D\) of
determinates&mdash;namely, the set of states of motion of the
molecules composing the gas that share the mean kinetic energy
specific for \(T\) and \(P\), given a fixed volume \(V\). In that
case, &ldquo;it follows from general properties of the
determinate/determinable relation that the law is necessary if
true&rdquo; (Kistler 2005: 217). That said, the supposition (following
Hooker 1981: 497) that macro-property determinables can be determined
by micro-physical properties, is not uncontroversial; this issue will
be revisited shortly.</p>

 MacDonald and MacDonald (1986) take the relation between mental and
physical properties to be analogous to, though not the same as,
determination; the analogy is in respect of a supposed identity of
determinable and determinate (mental and physical) property instances,
which is offered as avoiding causal overdetermination.</p>

 Either a powers-based account or Funkhouser&rsquo;s property-space
account can accommodate the morals: on a powers-based view,
science-relativity of determination dimensions reflects that
higher-level sciences associate fewer powers with determinables than
do lower-level sciences; on Funkhouser&rsquo;s view,
science-relativity reflects that what looks like a point relative to
one property space can, when &ldquo;magnified&rdquo;, be an extended
space, with further (possibly physical) determination dimensions.</p>

 As Worley says, &ldquo;One of the essential constituents of at least
intentional mental properties is that they have content. [&hellip;] If
mental properties determine physical properties, then, each realizing
physical property must have content as one of its constituents. But
physical properties don&rsquo;t have content as one of their
constituents&rdquo;. (1997: 294)</p>

 This treatment also suggests an answer to the &lsquo;problem of the
many&rsquo; (Unger 1980), according to which in cases involving Mount
Everest and its realizers, or Tibbles the cat and its
cat-constituters, too many mountains or cats are on the scene.
Instead, in such cases we can say that there is only one mountain, only one cat: the one
with the determinable boundary.</p>

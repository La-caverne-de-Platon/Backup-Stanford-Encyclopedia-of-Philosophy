<h2>Educational Methods</h2>

<p>
Experiments have shown that educational interventions can improve
critical thinking abilities and dispositions, as measured by
standardized tests. Glaser (1941) developed teaching materials
suitable for senior primary school, high school and college students.
To test their effectiveness, he developed with his sponsor Goodwin
Watson the Watson-Glaser Tests of Critical Thinking, whose descendants
are in widespread global use under the name &ldquo;Watson-Glaser
Critical Thinking Appraisal&rdquo; (Watson &amp; Glaser 1980a, 1980b,
1994). He found that senior secondary school students receiving 10
weeks of instruction using these materials improved their scores on
these tests more than other such students receiving the standard
English curriculum during the 10 weeks, to a degree that was
statistically significant (i.e., probably not due to chance). More
recently, Abrami et al. (2015) summarized in a meta-analysis the best
available evidence on the effectiveness of various strategies for
teaching students to think critically. The meta-analysis used as a
measure of effectiveness a modified version of a statistical measure
known as &ldquo;Cohen&rsquo;s d&rdquo;: the ratio of a difference in
mean score to the statistical deviation (SD) of the scores in a
reference group. A difference of 0.2 SD is a small effect, a
difference of 0.5 SD is a moderate effect, and a difference of 0.8 is
a large effect (Cohen 1988: 25&ndash;27). Abrami et al. (2015) found a
weighted mean effect size of 0.30 among 341 effect sizes, with effect
sizes ranging from &minus;1 to +2. This methodologically careful
meta-analysis provides strong statistical evidence that explicit
instruction for critical thinking can improve critical thinking
abilities and dispositions, as measured by standardized tests.</p>

<p>
Although contemporary meta-analysis provides a more justified verdict
on claims of causal effectiveness than other methods of investigation,
it does not give the reader an intuitive grasp of what difference a
particular intervention makes to the lives of those who receive it. To
get an appreciation of this difference, it helps to read the testimony
of the teachers and students in the Laboratory School of Chicago where
Dewey&rsquo;s ideas obtained concreteness. The history of the school,
written by two of its former teachers in collaboration with Dewey,
makes the following claim for the effects of its approach:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
As a result of this guarding and direction of their freedom, the
children retained the power of initiative naturally present in young
children through their inquisitive interests. This spirit of inquiry
was given plenty of opportunity and developed with most of the
children into the habit of trying a thing out for themselves. Thus,
they gradually became familiar with, and to varying degrees skilled
in, the use of the experimental method to solve problems in all areas
of their experience. (Mayhew &amp; Edwards 1936: 402&ndash;403)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A science teacher in the school wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I think the children did get the scientific attitude of mind. They
found out things for themselves. They worked out the simplest problems
that may have involved a most commonplace and everyday fact in the
manner that a really scientific investigator goes to work. (Mayhew
&amp; Edwards 1936: 403)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
An alumna of the school summed up the character of its former students
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It is difficult for me to be restrained about the character building
results of the Dewey School. As the years have passed and as I have
watched the lives of many Dewey School children, I have always been
astonished at the ease which fits them into all sorts and conditions
of emergencies. They do not vacillate and flounder under unstable
emotions; they go ahead and work out the problem in hand, guided by
their positively formed working habits. Discouragement to them is
non-existent, almost ad absurdum. For that very fact, accomplishment
in daily living is inevitable. Whoever has been given the working
pattern of tackling problems has a courage born of self-confidence and
achieves. (Mayhew &amp; Edwards 1936: 406&ndash;407)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the absence of control groups, of standardized tests, and of
statistical methods of controlling for confounding variables, such
testimonies are weak evidence of the effectiveness of educational
interventions in developing the abilities and dispositions of a
critical thinker&mdash;in Dewey&rsquo;s conception, a scientific
attitude. But they give a vivid impression of what might be
accomplished in an educational system that takes the development of
critical thinking as a goal.</p>

<p>
Dewey established the Laboratory School explicitly as an experiment to
test his theory of knowledge, which </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
emphasized the part in the development of thought of problems which
originated in active situations and also the necessity of testing
thought by action if thought was to pass over into knowledge. (Dewey
1936: 464) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hence the curriculum of the school started from situations familiar to
children from their home life (such as preparing food and making
clothing) and posed problems that the children were to solve by doing
things and noting the consequences. This curriculum was adjusted in
the light of its observed results in the classroom.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The school&rsquo;s continued experimentation with the subject matter
of the elementary curriculum proved that classroom results were best
when activities were in accord with the child&rsquo;s changing
interests, his growing consciousness of the relation of means and
ends, and his increasing willingness to perfect means and to postpone
satisfactions in order to arrive at better ends&hellip;. The important
question for those guiding this process of growth, and of promoting
the alignment and cooperation of interest and effort, is this. What
specific subject-matter or mode of skill has such a vital connection
with the child&rsquo;s interest, existing powers, and capabilities as
will extend the one [the interest&ndash;DH] and stimulate, exercise,
and carry forward the others [the powers and capabilities&ndash;DH] in
a progressive course of action? (Mayhew &amp; Edwards 1936:
420&ndash;421)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In an appendix to the history of the Laboratory School, Dewey (1936:
468&ndash;469) acknowledges that the school did not solve the problem
of finding things in the child&rsquo;s present experience out of which
would grow more elaborate, technical and organized knowledge. Passmore
(1980: 91) notes one difficulty of starting from children&rsquo;s
out-of-school experiences: they differ a lot from one child to
another. More fundamentally, the everyday out-of-school experiences of
a child provide few links to the systematic knowledge of nature and of
human history that humanity has developed and that schools should pass
on to the next generation. If children are to acquire such knowledge
through investigation of problems, teachers must first provide
information as a basis for formulating problems that interest them
(Passmore 1980: 93&ndash;94).</p>

<p>
More than a century has passed since Dewey&rsquo;s experiment. In the
interim, researchers have refined the methodology of experimenting
with human subjects, in educational research and elsewhere. They have
also developed the methodology of meta-analysis for combining the
results of various experiments to form a comprehensive picture of what
has been discovered. Abrami et al. (2015) report the results of such a
meta-analysis of all the experimental and quasi-experimental studies
published or archived before 2010 that used as outcome variables
standardized measures of critical thinking abilities or dispositions
of the sort enumerated in Facione 1990a and described in sections
 <a href="index-2.html#CritThinDisp">8</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#CritThinAbil">9</a>
 of the main entry. By an experimental study, they mean one in which
participants are divided randomly into two groups, one of which
receives the educational intervention designed to improve critical
thinking and the other of which serves as a control; they found few
such experiments, because of the difficulty of achieving randomization
in the classrooms where the studies were conducted. By a
quasi-experiment, they mean a study with an intervention group that
receives an educational intervention designed to improve critical
thinking and a control group, but without random allocation to the two
groups. Initially, they included also what they called
&ldquo;pre-experiments&rdquo;, with single-group pretest-posttest
designs, but decided at the analysis stage not to include these
studies. By a standardized measure, they mean a test with norms
derived from previous administration of the test, as set out in the
test&rsquo;s manual, such as the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking
Appraisal (Watson &amp; Glaser 1980a, 1980b, 1994), the Cornell
Critical Thinking Tests (Ennis &amp; Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman,
&amp; Tomko 1985; 2005), the California Critical Thinking Skills Test
(Facione 1990b, 1992) and the California Critical Thinking
Dispositions Inventory (Facione &amp; Facione 1992; Facione, Facione,
&amp; Giancarlo 2001). They included all such studies in which the
educational intervention lasted at least three hours and the
participants were at least six years old.</p>

<p>
In these studies they found 341 effect sizes. They rated each
educational intervention according to the degree to which it involved
dialogue, anchored instruction, and mentoring. They found that each of
these factors increased the effectiveness of the educational
intervention, and that they were most effective when combined. They
explained the three factors as follows.</p>

<p>
<em>Dialogue</em>: In critical dialogue, which historically goes back
to Socrates, individuals discuss a problem together. The dialogue can
be oral or written, and cooperative or adversarial. It can take the
form of asking questions, discussion, or debate. Some curricula
designed to promote critical thinking establish &ldquo;communities of
inquiry&rdquo; among the students. Such communities were a prominent
feature of Dewey&rsquo;s Laboratory School, incorporated as a means of
promoting the primary moral objective of fostering a spirit of social
cooperation among the children.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
An important aspect of this conditioning process by means of the
school&rsquo;s daily practices was to aid each child in forming a
habit of thinking before doing in all of his various enterprises. The
daily classroom procedure began with a face-to-face discussion of the
work of the day and its relation to that of the previous period. The
new problem was then faced, analyzed, and possible plans and resources
for its solution suggested by members of the group. The children soon
grew to like this method. It gave both individual and group a sense of
power to be intelligent, to know what they wanted to do before they
did it, and to realize the reasons why one plan was preferred to
another. It also enlisted their best effort to prove the validity of
their judgment by testing the plan in action. Each member of the group
thus acquired a habit of observing, criticizing, and integrating
values in thought, in order that they should guide the action that
would integrate them in fact. The value of thus previsioning
consequences of action before they became fixed as fact was emphasized
in the school&rsquo;s philosophy. The social implication is evident.
The conscious direction of his actions toward considered social ends
became an unfailing index of the child&rsquo;s progress toward
maturity. (Mayhew &amp; Edwards 1936: 423&ndash;424)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Communities of inquiry are also a feature of the Montessori method
described by Thayer-Bacon (2000) and of the Philosophy for Children
program developed by Matthew Lipman (Splitter 1987).</p>

<p>
<em>Anchored instruction</em>: In anchored instruction, whose advocacy
goes back to Rousseau (1762) and Dewey (1910), there is an effort to
present students with problems that make sense to them, engage them,
and stimulate them to inquire. Simulations, role-playing and
presentation of ethical or medical dilemmas are methods of
anchoring.</p>

<p>
<em>Mentoring</em>: Mentoring is a one-on-one relationship in which
someone with more relevant expertise (the mentor) interacts with
someone with less (the mentee). The mentor acts as a model and as a
critic correcting errors by the mentee. Examples of mentoring are an
advisor talking to a student, a physician modeling a procedure for a
medical student, and an employee correcting an intern. Abrami et al.
(2015) identified three kinds of mentoring in the studies that they
analyzed: one-on-one teacher-student interaction, peer-led dyads, and
internships.</p>

<p>
Abrami et al. (2015) also compared educational interventions with
respect to whether they were part of subject-matter instruction. For
this purpose, they used a distinction among four types of intervention
articulated by Ennis (1989). A general approach tries to teach
critical thinking separately from subject-matter instruction. An
infusion approach combines deep subject-matter instruction in which
students are encouraged to think critically with explicit reference to
critical thinking principles. An immersion approach provides deep
subject-matter instruction with encouragement to think critically, but
without explicit reference to critical thinking principles. A mixed
approach combines the general approach with either the infusion or the
immersion approach; students combine a separate thread or course aimed
at teaching general critical thinking principles with deep
subject-matter instruction in which they are encouraged to think
critically about the subject-matter. Although the average effect size
in the studies using a mixed intervention (+0.38) was greater than the
average effect sizes in the studies using general (+0.26), infusion
(+0.29) and immersion (+0.23) interventions, the difference was not
statistically significant; in other words, it might have been due to
chance.</p>

<p> Ennis (2013, 2018) has made a detailed proposal for a mixed
approach to teaching critical thinking across the curriculum of
undergraduate education. Attempts at implementing such an approach
have faced difficulties. Weinstein (2013: 209&ndash;213) describes the
attempt at Montclair State University in Montclair, New Jersey, from
1987 through the 1990s. He reports that the university&rsquo;s
requirement to include critical thinking in all general education
courses led to the use of the concept in identifying topics and tasks
in course syllabi, but without a unifying theoretical basis. The
committee that approved courses as satisfying a general education
requirement ignored the relation of curricular outcomes to critical
thinking, and focused instead on work requirements with a prima facie
relation to reflective thought: term papers, projects, group work, and
dialogue. Sheffield (2018) reports similar difficulties encountered in
his position from 2012 to 2015 as the inaugural Eugene H. Fram Chair
in Applied Critical Thinking at Rochester Institute of Technology
(RIT) in Rochester, New York. A cross-disciplinary faculty advisory
group was not ready to accept RIT&rsquo;s approved definition of
critical thinking, but never reached a consensus on an
alternative. Payette and Ross (2016), on the other hand, report
widespread acceptance of the Paul-Elder framework, which involves
elements of thought, intellectual standards, and intellectual virtues
(Paul &amp; Elder 2006). Sheffield (2018) reports that many colleges
and universities in the United States have received funding for
so-called &ldquo;Quality Enhancement Plans&rdquo; (QEPs) devoted to
critical thinking, many of them written by Paul and Elder or developed
in consultation with them. He faults the plans for having a typical
time frame of five years, which he argues is probably too short for
meaningful results, since lasting institutional change is often
extremely slow.</p>

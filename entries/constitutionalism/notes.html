<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Constitutionalism</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>
Unless otherwise indicated,
the word &lsquo;power&rsquo; should be taken to mean normative power of
the kind associated with the theory developed by legal theorist Wesley
Hohfeld. A normative power, on this understanding, is the capacity or
ability to effect a change in the relevant normative landscape of
rights, duties, privileges, and so on. When a legislature enacts a new
law it exercises its normative power to alter existing legal rights,
duties, etc., or create new ones that did not exist before that legal
power was exercised.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
Unless otherwise indicated,
the term &ldquo;constitutional&rdquo; (and its cognate terms &ldquo;constitutionalism&rdquo;,
&ldquo;constitution&rdquo;, and so on) should henceforth be understood to carry
this richer meaning.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
Whether Locke and Hobbes
are properly invoked in this way is perhaps open to question. There is
reason to believe that Locke's argument defends political, as opposed
to strictly legal, limitations upon the sovereign. It might be argued
that effective political limitation requires legal limitation as well,
but this does not seem strictly necessary.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
&ldquo;For to be subject to laws
is to be subject to the commonwealth &mdash; that is to the sovereign
&mdash; that is, to himself, which is not subjection but freedom from
the laws&rdquo; (Leviathan, Ch. 29, 255).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>  What Parliament does &ldquo;no
authority upon Earth can undo.&rdquo; (Sir William Blackstone) Three
points are worth stressing here. First, it is not at all clear that
the British Parliament ever did possess the unlimited sovereignty
ascribed to it by Blackstone. Although the United Kingdom has no
written constitution of the kind one finds in the United States, legal
scholars are generally in agreement that Britain has, for centuries,
contained an unwritten constitution arising from a variety of sources,
including long-standing principles of the common law and landmark
judicial decisions concerning the appropriate limits of Parliament's
legislative power (see 
<a href="index-2.html#Wri">Section 4</a>). 
Second, the British constitution also includes a number of
written documents adopted at various points in its political history,
a primary example being Magna Carta (1215 C.E.).  Third, it is
arguable that the people of the United Kingdom, in virtue of their
membership in the European Community and the fact that British Courts
now enforce, as binding, Community law, have in fact relinquished
their unlimited sovereignty. If the law of member states (e.g.,
France, Denmark, and the UK) must now be consistent with Community
law, and the latter is immune from legislative change or repeal
through legislative acts on the part of member governments, then it
can be argued that the sovereignty of the member states within the
European Community has been replaced (or supplemented) by the
sovereignty of &ldquo;the people of Europe.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
Leviathan, Part 1, Ch. 13.
Although Hobbes's sovereign is constitutionally unlimited, Hobbes
insisted that individuals retained the right to self-preservation. It
would be incoherent, Hobbes thought, for individuals to give up that
right the protection of which is the very reason people have for
creating a sovereign power. Although individuals retain the right to
self-preservation, it is also true that Hobbes' unlimited sovereign has
the right to take anyone's life if, in the sovereign's judgment, this
is necessary to preserve the well being of the commonwealth.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
Constitutional conventions
are explored in
 <a href="index-2.html#ConLawVerConCon">Section 6</a>. Although entrenchment is an almost
universal characteristic of modern constitutions, and although one
could plausibly argue that it is practically desirable, it may not be
absolutely necessary. Some constitutional norms are ordinary statutes
amenable to introduction and change by ordinary legislative procedures.
Indeed, some constitutions are almost wholly statutory, e.g., the
constitution of New Zealand.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
Two different procedures
for amending The United States Constitution are specified in Article V.
First, amendment can take place by a vote of two-thirds of both the
House of Representatives and the Senate followed by a ratification of
three-fourths of the various state legislatures. This first
method of amendment is the only one that has ever been used.
Second, the Constitution might be amended by a Convention called for
this purpose by two-thirds of the state legislatures. The
Convention's proposed amendments must later be ratified by
three-fourths of the state legislatures. In Canada, the process of
amendment is laid out in Part V (sections 38 to 49) of
the Constitution Act, 1982. The general amendment procedure is commonly
referred to as <em>the 7/50 formula</em> (section
38.(1)). This requires resolutions of the Senate, the House of Commons,
and the legislative assemblies of at least two thirds of the provinces
(7) that have at least 50% of the population of Canada as a whole.
These cover, e.g., amendments in relation to the powers of the
Senate and the method of selecting Senators. Other amendments relating,
for example, to the Office of the Governor General or the composition
of the Supreme Court, require unanimous consent of the Senate, the
House of Commons, and the legislative assembly of each province.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
The matter is far from
clear. There is a long-standing tradition within British Parliamentary
systems of governance according to which Parliament alone possesses
authority to create, interpret and implement its own constitutional
limits. And whatever its faults, there seems little doubt that
Parliaments modeled on the British system typically act responsibly in
observing their own constitutional limits.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
This is not,
incidentally, Rubenfeld's reason.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
For an example where the
distinction between constitutional law and convention served as the
basis of a court ruling, see the Canadian <em>Patriation</em>
<em>Reference</em>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. at 870. For discussion of this
case, and for further elaboration of the difference between
constitutional law and convention, see Waluchow 2011.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
Henceforth, and unless
otherwise indicated, all uses of the word &lsquo;constitution&rsquo;
(and cognate terms) should be understood as referring to constitutional
law.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
This is not to deny that
deep controversy can also arise over the meaning and import of less
abstract constitutional provisions. In the United States, for example,
debates sometimes arise over the meaning of the so-called
&ldquo;Commerce Clause.&rdquo; Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3 of the
U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power &ldquo;to regulate commerce
with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian
tribes.&rdquo; The US Congress has often used the Commerce Clause to
justify exercises of legislative power with respect to the
activities of states and their citizens. This has, in turn, led to
significant dispute regarding the proper balance of power between the
federal government and the states. Despite the importance of such
debates, and unless the context indicates otherwise, our focus in
discussing constitutional interpretation will be exclusively on
abstract civil rights provisions. It is in terms of these that the most
deeply felt differences of opinion emerge in their starkest form and bring sharply into focus differences of opinion on the nature and authority of constitutions.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
Again, this is not to
deny that disputes also arise over less abstract, morally charged
constitutional provisions, such as the US Commerce Clause. Nor is it to
deny that the same deep divisions lie behind these such disputes.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
To be both clear and
fair, virtually all originalists believe that original understandings
are sometimes underdetermined. They fail to determine concrete results
and decisions about particular cases and issues. When this difficulty
pops up in a constitutional case, many originalists argue that the
judge must sometimes resort to a type of reasoning that is different
from constitutional interpretation. Keith Whittington (1999a)
argues that the American Constitution has a dual nature. The first
aspect is the degree to which the Constitution acts as a binding set of
rules that can be neutrally interpreted and enforced by the courts
against government actors. This is the process of constitutional
interpretation and the desired neutrality is achieved by having judges
focus on original, public understandings of the Constitution's
terms. But according to Whittington, the US Constitution also serves to
guide political actors in the process of making public
policy. In so doing, the Constitution is dependent on political actors,
both to formulate authoritative, concrete constitutional requirements
and rules and to enforce them in future cases. Whittington describes
this process as <em>constitutional construction</em> as opposed to
constitutional interpretation.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
Sections 8 and 9 draw extensively from Waluchow 2012.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
<em>Brown v. Board of
Education</em> ((1954) 347 U.S. 483. According to the US Supreme Court,
&ldquo;[t]he &rdquo;separate but equal&ldquo; doctrine adopted in <em>Plessy</em>
<em>v. Ferguson</em> (1896) <em>163 U.S. 537</em>)<em>,</em> has no
place in the field of public education.&rdquo;
<em>Plessy</em><em>,</em> decided in 1896, essentially affirmed the
original understanding of &lsquo;equal protection&rsquo; as being fully
consistent with that doctrine.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
<em>Roe v. Wade</em>
((1973) 410 U.S. 113).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>  This is a point Scalia himself
seems to acknowledge. &ldquo;I hasten to confess that in a crunch I
may prove a faint-hearted originalist. I cannot imagine myself, any
more than any other federal judge, upholding a statute that imposes
the punishment of flogging&rdquo; (Scalia 1989, 864). The assumption
underlying Scalia's comment is that the original understanding of the
8<sup>th</sup> Amendment endorsed flogging as an acceptable form of
punishment. The 8<sup>th</sup> Amendment states that &ldquo;Excessive
bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and
unusual punishments inflicted.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
The Preamble to the US
Constitution reads as follows: 
</p>

<blockquote><p> We the People of the United States, in Order to form a
more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility,
provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and
secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do
ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of
America.</p></blockquote><p>  The preamble to the <em>Basic Law for
the Federal Republic of Germany</em> is equally abstract:
</p><blockquote>

<p>
Conscious of their responsibility before God and man, Inspired by the
determination to promote world peace as an equal partner in a united
Europe, the German people, in the exercise of their constituent power,
have adopted this Basic Law.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
For a view which
essentially collapses the distinction between originalism and living
constitutionalism, see Balkin 2011.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
It is at this point that
originalists might claim that judges must resort to the process of
&lsquo;constitutional construction.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
Once again, we must bear
in mind that the focus in these sections on interpretation is on the
interpretation of abstract civil rights provisions. No constitutional
theorist would deny that many very specific or concrete constitutional
provisions are fixed by the plain meaning of the text, by an
understanding of the text that remains constant throughout the decades
and possibly centuries. Consider, for example, Article 54(2) of the
German <em>Basic Law which</em> states that &ldquo;The term of office
of the Federal President shall be five years. Re-election for a
consecutive term shall be permitted only once.&rdquo; &lsquo;Five
years&rsquo; meant five years in 1949. It still means five years in
2017.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>
Some hard critics, e.g.,
those within what is popularly known as the <em>critical legal
studies</em> movement, are prepared to broaden their critique to cover
areas of law outside constitutional practice, such as tort or contract
law. See, e.g., Unger (1986).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>
&ldquo;I no longer
believe that constitutional theory constrains, or is supposed to
constrain judges. Rather&hellip;it serves primarily to provide a set of
rhetorical devices that judges can deploy as they believe effective.&rdquo;
(Tushnet 1992, 759).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>
<em>Lochner v. New York</em>, 198 U.S. 45 (1905).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>  Judicial review need not focus
on compatibility with constitutional standards. For instance, it might
be based on standards of reasonableness or fairness developed by
judges in contract or administrative law. Our focus will be on
judicial review as it features in constitutional practice, that is, on
what we have been calling 'constitutional review'.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a> The distinction between
strong-form review and weak-form review was first introduced by Mark
Tushnet. See his &ldquo;Forms of Judicial Review as Expressions of
Constitutional Patriatism&rdquo; 2003 <em>Law and Philosophy</em> 22:
381&ndash;392</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>  The phrase 'tyranny of the
majority' was first coined by French political theorist Alexis de
Tocqueville in <em> Democracy in America</em> and later made famous by
by John Stuart Mill in <em>On Liberty</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>  Among the most notorious,
contemporary examples is <em>Bush v. Gore</em> 531 U.S. 98 (2000)
where, in a 5-4 decision the United State Supreme Court put a stop to
a recount of Florida votes cast in the very close 2000 Presidential
election. Had the recount proceeded it's quite possible that the
Democratic Party candidate, Al Gore, would have won over the
Republican Party candidate, George W. Bush.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-31">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a>  I say an &ldquo;effective&rdquo; form of
Section 33 because only two provinces and one territory have employed the
section to override provincial legislation, the last time in
1986. Fearing the perception that it is a legislative body willing to
violate fundamental rights, Parliament and the provincial legislatures
have been reluctant to invoke Section 33, leading some to view it as
essentially dead-letter law. </p>

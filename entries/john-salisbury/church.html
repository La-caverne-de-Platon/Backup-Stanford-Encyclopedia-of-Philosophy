<h2>Princely Tyranny and the Liberty of the Church</h2>

<p>
John of Salisbury describes the proper concord that ought to obtain
between a prince and his archbishop, and the benefits that flow
therefrom, as well as its opposite, in a letter from Archbishop
Theobald to King Henry II:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
When the members of the Church are united in loyalty and love, when
princes show due reverence to priests, and priests render faithful
service to princes, then do kingdoms enjoy that true peace and
tranquillity that must always be the goal of our desire. But if they
clash, one against the other, in all their might, then the vigour of
the secular power will be impaired no less than the ecclesiastical
&hellip; (JL1: 190).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Half a century earlier, Henry I had been the beneficiary of happy
relations between himself and his archbishop, writing to Anselm that
he attributed his successful Normandy campaign &ldquo;to the merits of
the concord and peace which had been re-established between
[us]&rdquo; (A&amp;B: 61). Anselm had not, however, enjoyed positive
relations with Henry&rsquo;s predecessor, William Rufus. Anselm had
protested being installed archbishop of Canterbury on the grounds that
he, a sheep, ought not to be yoked to Rufus, a raging bull (Eadmer
<em>History</em>: 37). Emerging from John&rsquo;s conception of the
ecclesiastical soul that resides in and guides the secular body
politic, mutuality and balance are necessary pre-conditions to
concord. John affirms, of Archbishop Thomas Becket and King Henry II,
that &ldquo;these two [are] the princes of the people, of whom one
regulates things spiritual, the other guides things temporal&rdquo;
(JL2: 106&ndash;07). Yet, despite their comity during the years in
which Becket served as Henry&rsquo;s chancellor (see, for example,
JL1: 221), a virtual state of war characterized their
&lsquo;princely&rsquo; relationship during Becket&rsquo;s
archiepiscopacy. The fundamental cause of this protracted conflict lay
in Henry&rsquo;s (immoderate) disregard for the proper boundary
separating the spiritual from the temporal realm and his consequent
incursions upon the liberty of the church.</p>

<p>
Although John mentions Becket&rsquo;s &ldquo;immoderate youth&rdquo;
in his <em>Life of Thomas Becket</em>, this is a hagiographical
commonplace whose roots extend back to the <em>Confessions</em> of St.
Augustine. In contrast, Archbishop Theobald&rsquo;s early assessment
of Henry II ought to be regarded more seriously. John reports that
Theobald bore concerns over </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the young age of the king &hellip; and he feared the foolishness and
malice of the youths and perverse men by whose advice the king seemed
to be guided. (A&amp;B: 76) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In brokering Becket&rsquo;s appointment to the chancellorship, the
archbishop hoped that Becket </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
might restrain the violent impulse of the new king lest he vent his
rage upon the Church &hellip; might temper the maliciousness of the
advice given to the king, and repress the boldness of officials who
&hellip; conspired to plunder the property of the Church
&hellip;.(A&amp;B: 76) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Out of these concerns emerges the clear impression that, even in the
early days of his reign, Henry II (and his court) was immoderate in
character, in thrall to the passions, and entirely dismissive of the
boundary separating the spiritual realm from his own. Nor did
Theobald&rsquo;s hope in Becket&rsquo;s moderating effect bear evident
fruit. Such was Henry&rsquo;s assessment of Becket&rsquo;s character
that the king arranged his elevation to the archbishopric of
Canterbury in the belief that Henry might thereby </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
more easily rule the whole English Church &hellip; [since Becket]
would manage everything in ecclesiastical and secular affairs
according to the king&rsquo;s will &hellip;. (A&amp;B: 77) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
For his part, Becket perceived that, as head of the English church, he
could not &ldquo;comply &hellip; with the impulses of the king, nor
could he fail to have the king as an enemy&rdquo; should he properly
execute the duties of an ecclesiastical prince and defend the
liberties of his new realm (A&amp;B: 78). It did not, in fact, take
long for conflict between these heads of church and state to
erupt.</p>

<p>
Only two years after Becket&rsquo;s consecration, he found it
necessary to escape into exile in France, where John had preceded him
some months before. John&rsquo;s attitude toward the archbishop and
the king, and toward the conflict itself, was initially, and equally,
unsympathetic, even critical, and, notably, couched in the language of
immoderation. On the one hand, Henry was demanding an unwavering and
unquestioning acceptance of his dictates incompatible with liberty. In
an unflattering assessment, John remarks that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[i]t is the man&rsquo;s [Henry&rsquo;s] nature to make light of all
the merits of one who for whatever reasons breaks or postpones
obedience to a single mandate, no matter what it is. The
&lsquo;moderation&rsquo; of his requests &hellip; is such that it is
sometimes necessary to disobey. (JL2: 468&ndash;69; translation
revised) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On the other hand, John displays an acute awareness of the
archbishop&rsquo;s defects, which he ascribes to a tendency to exceed
moderate bounds, such that John found it necessary to </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
upbraid &hellip; the lord archbishop &hellip; on the grounds that he
has from the beginning inadvisedly provoked the resentment of the king
and court by his zeal, since many provisions should have been made for
place and time and persons. (JL2: 48&ndash;49; translation revised)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, in the early days of their mutual, though separate, sojourn in
France, John opined that &ldquo;the exile has undoubtably been
profitable to the archbishop of Canterbury both for his learning and
his character &hellip;&rdquo; (JL2: 48&ndash;49). John&rsquo;s views
on the parties to and cause of the conflict changed dramatically over
the course of the exile, especially after he failed to reach a
personal reconciliation with the king, who demanded secular fealty
over ecclesiastical loyalty. (See, e.g., JL2: 48&ndash;49, wherein
John expresses his desire to find &ldquo;a formula [of oath to Henry]
which will not inflict on me the stigma of treachery or a stain on my
honour&rdquo;.)</p>

<p>
From this point forward, John views the dispute as a &ldquo;conflict
of power and justice&rdquo; (JL2: 128&ndash;29), in which Becket is
fighting for the most &ldquo;righteous cause &hellip; the
Church&rsquo;s liberty&rdquo; (JL2: 236&ndash;37). Consonant with this
reorientation, John&rsquo;s stance toward Becket becomes supportive
and advisory, encouraging him to display virtuous moderation in his
negotiations with his opponents: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
With moderation write and state the conditions [of a reconciliation],
since it seems to be certain that the souls of the enemies of
God&rsquo;s church are so hardened that they will admit no condition
at all (JL2: 168&ndash;69) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
At the same time, John dedicates himself to the tireless promotion of
Becket&rsquo;s cause against Henry&mdash;or rather, of the
church&rsquo;s persecution at the hands of a
&ldquo;tyrant&rdquo;&mdash;penning myriad letters to prelates and
clerics throughout western Christendom. (For a detailed discussion of
John&rsquo;s epistolary activites during this period, see Bollermann
and Nederman 2015.) So highly did John regard Becket&rsquo;s steadfast
devotion to the defense of the church&rsquo;s liberty that John
numbers Becket among holy Canterbury archbishops of the past: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I should not dare to place him who is now set over us [Becket] on a
par with his predecessors who are glittering with miracles in our
church. But the cause which he defends I think no whit inferior to
theirs, for it is the same, since both for him and them the fight was
for the freedom and safety of the church. (JL2: 304&ndash;07) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
John, of course, could have had no idea that, only a few years later,
Becket would become Canterbury&rsquo;s most famous martyr-saint.</p>

<p>
John&rsquo;s praise of Becket and the rightness of his cause stand in
stark contrast to his increasingly critical opinion of Henry II.
John&rsquo;s letters are replete with references to Henry as a
&ldquo;tyrant&rdquo; (see, e.g., JL2: 237&ndash;38, 429&ndash;30,
455&ndash;58), as well as with accounts of the specific ways in which
his tyranny, often fueled by excessive rage, is expressed. The
king&rsquo;s actions following Becket&rsquo;s clandestine departure
for France provide an early example and proved to be a harbinger of
things to come. Not only did Henry order the confiscation of all of
Canterbury&rsquo;s, Becket&rsquo;s, and his men&rsquo;s property,
but</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
what is unheard of anywhere in history, he sentenced to exile all the
archbishop&rsquo;s kinsmen and all who were connected to him by
friendship or any other pretext at all, without distinction of rank or
order, of status or fortune, of age or sex, for both women lying in
childbirth and infants waiting in their cradles were driven into
exile. His savage fury and cruelty &hellip; proceeded farther, for
&hellip; it was forbidden for anyone to assist the archbishop, even by
the aid of prayers (A&amp;B: 87).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Henry&rsquo;s unbounded rage and excessively punitive actions appear
all the more vicious when set against the &ldquo;moderate&rdquo;
conditions of exile that Archbishop Theobald had endured under King
Stephen, which John relates in the <em>Historia Pontificalis</em>:
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The archbishop alone suffered &hellip; his friends were free to come
and go as they wished and even &hellip; to bring him material
assistance for his needs. (HP: 42) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Bearing in mind the fact that John wrote this text not long after
Becket&rsquo;s exile had commenced, the implication that he intended
this account to be read as a critique of Henry II seems
inescapable. The last words are especially poignant, as many of
John&rsquo;s exilic letters plead for financial support from members
of the English church for Becket and his fellow ex-patriots.</p>

<p>
Not only does John consistently portray Henry II as a tyrannical
oppressor of the church, John explicitly connects him to Emperor
Frederick Barbarossa, who had &ldquo;turned from prince to tyrant, and
from catholic emperor became a schismatic and a heretic&rdquo; on
account of his efforts to install the anti-pope Victor (JL2:
216&ndash;17). Now that God has exacted his vengeance on Barbarossa
and his realm (JL2: 216&ndash;17, 273&ndash;74), John predicts a
similarly dire consequence for Henry II, who presently &ldquo;walks in
Frederick&rsquo;s paths&rdquo; (JL2: 574&ndash;75), unless he
reconciles with his archbishop and restores to the English church her
sovereign liberties. While immoderation on the part of an
ecclesiastical prince, as John had initially charged Becket,
<em>could</em> lead to unnecessary and disruptive strife in the realm,
immoderation on the part of a secular prince led invariably to a
fundamental violation of the church&rsquo;s liberty, placing the
well-being of the entire realm in serious peril and, as a necessary
corollary, rendering the prince a tyrant.</p>

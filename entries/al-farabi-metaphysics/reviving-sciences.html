<h2>F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s project of reviving the sciences of the ancients</h2>

<p>
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; did not, like some philosophers before him
(Alexander of Aphrodisias) and after him (Averroes, Thomas Aquinas),
work out his metaphysical thought in a commentary on Aristotle&rsquo;s
<em>Metaphysics</em>. But on metaphysics, as elsewhere, many of his
writings stand in close relations to ancient Greek texts as he knew
them in Arabic
 translation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-rs-1" id="ref-rs-1">1</a>]</sup>
 While F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; wrote commentaries on
Aristotle&rsquo;s logical works (only the commentary on <em>On
Interpretation</em> survives), and perhaps on some other texts, more
often he writes books with the same titles as works of Aristotle,
i.e., with titles that were often used in Arabic to refer to those
texts (<em>Categories</em>, <em>On Demonstration</em> = <em>Posterior
Analytics</em>, <em>Book of Letters</em> = <em>Metaphysics</em>). Or
he writes discussions of the aims of Aristotle or some other Greek
thinker in some particular text, like his <em>On the aims of the Sage
in each book of the treatise which is called the Book of Letters, that
is, the determination of Aristotle&rsquo;s aim in his treatise the
Metaphysics</em> (abbreviated here as <em>On the Aims of the
Metaphysics</em>); his <em>On the Philosophy of Plato</em> and <em>On
the Philosophy of Aristotle</em> consist mainly of short summaries of
what subject each text of these authors was devoted to and what the
author aimed to accomplish in writing it. In these texts
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; is picking up from the late ancient Greek
commentators on Plato and Aristotle who wrote about the
&ldquo;aim&rdquo; or &ldquo;object&rdquo; (Greek <em>skopos</em>) of
each authoritative text, or of the science that that text was devoted
to teaching. In some other texts, such as <em>On Intelligence</em> (or
<em>On the Intellect</em>) he does not take some one Greek text as his
overall model, but rather discusses the different things meant by one
word, here &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; (Arabic <em>&#703;aql</em>,
translating Greek <em>nous</em>), in different scientific disciplines
and different texts, especially in Arabic translations of Greek
philosophical texts: even if his official aim is just to disambiguate,
to forestall confusions arising from different uses of the same term
or from misleading translations, this in effect gives him a way of
writing a systematic treatise, deriving from a range of Greek sources,
on the different things called &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; and how they
are related.</p>

<p>
Sometimes when F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; writes about the aims of some
Greek text, it is clear that he does not genuinely have access to the
text. In fact, he does not seem to have read any of the Platonic texts
that he describes in <em>On the Philosophy of Plato</em>: he gives no
sign of knowing that Plato wrote in dialogue form. (He has, however,
read the large majority of the texts by Aristotle that we can read
now.) In cases where he does not have access to the primary source, he
reconstructs from whatever sources of information are available to
him. But this is a matter of degree: since F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;
does not read Greek, he <em>never</em> has access to the primary
source, but at best to a translation, and F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;
suspects that the translations are systematically misleading, and
takes it as a challenge to reconstruct the original thought behind the
veil of the translations. (In some cases he does not have translations
of the original text but, for instance, translations of late ancient
summaries, such as Galen&rsquo;s summaries of some Platonic
dialogues.) F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s interest in the Greek
legacy is almost exclusively an interest in the Greek
<em>sciences</em>, chiefly philosophy but also mathematics (including
astronomy and music theory) and medicine. In this he is typical of
Arabic-writing authors, whether Muslim or Christian or Jewish or
Sabian. (This contrasts with Latin writers, whose reception of Greek
culture includes, especially, imitating Greek poetry: the Arabs have
their own proud tradition of poetry, and see no need to improve it by
importing Greek mythological and polytheistic poetry.) He does not
think that the Greeks had any monopoly on reason, or any special
access to the sciences just because they were Greek, but he does think
that Greek thinkers, especially Plato and Aristotle, possessed
sciences which either are not still practiced in
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s own time and in his own linguistic
and religious community, or are practiced only imperfectly, in a
sub-scientific way; and he thinks that we can acquire these sciences
if we can reconstruct the thought of the original texts. When
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; writes a description or close paraphrase of a
Greek text, this is to help himself or his readers gain control over
the text, but he is aiming at something more ambitious: to write the
kind of text that Aristotle or Plato would have written, possessing
the sciences they did, if they had been writing in Arabic, for a
mostly Muslim audience, and were able to respond to discussions after
their own lifetimes.</p>

<p>
Why is it so important to recapture these ancient sciences, and
especially the philosophical disciplines including metaphysics? The
F&acirc;r&acirc;bian text which is clearest about the motivations is a
text whose authenticity has been challenged, but which will
provisionally be assumed here to be by F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;, the
<em>Harmonization of the Two Sages, the Divine Plato and
 Aristotle.</em><sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-rs-2" id="ref-rs-2">2</a>]</sup>
 This text starts by saying &ldquo;I see most of the people of our
time delving into and disputing over whether the world is generated or
eternal&rdquo; (#1), and claiming that Plato and Aristotle disagree,
on various questions but especially on this one. Why are people so
agitated about this particular issue, and why is it so important
whether Plato and Aristotle disagree about it? As
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; says later in this text, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Had God not rescued intelligent and mindful people by means of these
two sages and those pursuing their approach &hellip; [on the issue of
whether and in what sense the world is created] &hellip; mankind would
have remained in perplexity and bewilderment. (#58) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So apparently people are in disagreement about this and kindred
questions, disagreement which threatens to be interminable, with
arguments on both sides but no agreed criterion for deciding between
them; and Plato and Aristotle claim to have rescued mankind (not only
their own contemporaries but also F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s)
from this otherwise interminable disagreement, by founding the science
of philosophy, which provides demonstrations and also provides methods
for recognizing whether an argument is demonstrative and when it is
dialectical or rhetorical or worse. F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; says of
Plato and Aristotle not only that they were the founders of
philosophy, but also that &ldquo;the recourse is to them&rdquo;
 (#2):<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-rs-3" id="ref-rs-3">3</a>]</sup>
 this whole rescue-mission fails if it turns out that Plato and
Aristotle themselves were in a disagreement about the disputed
questions and were unable to resolve it.</p>

<p>
To see why people in F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s time were so
concerned about the question of the createdness or eternity of the
world, and why they might hope that Plato or Aristotle would help them
resolve it, we need some context in the religious disputes within the
early Islamicate world. There are apparently irresolvable disputes not
only between religious communities (e.g., Muslims vs. Christians,
Monophysite vs. Nestorian Christians), but also disputes within each
community, notably within F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s Muslim
community, and these disputes may have implications for how both
individuals and whole communities should live. The issues include
particular questions of religious law or scriptural interpretation,
and the basic &ldquo;political&rdquo; questions of who is legitimately
a member, and who is legitimately a leader, of the religious
community. But there are also fundamental issues about the nature of
God and his relation to human beings and to the world. Some groups
maintain that God is obliged to follow objective rules of justice,
such as not punishing humans for any actions they did not freely
choose; others maintain that all things, including human actions and
rules of judgment, are determined by God&rsquo;s will. Authoritative
religious texts describe God as acting in ways similar to human beings
(for instance, speaking), and give him a series of &ldquo;names&rdquo;
or attributes. The Qur&#702;&acirc;n, in particular, makes it an
obligation to address God by his names (Q 7:180), but it also says
that nothing resembles him (Q 42:11), which seems to imply that no
name can be asserted univocally of God and of human beings or other
creatures. Which of God&rsquo;s actions and attributes should be taken
as merely metaphorical, and if so metaphorical for what, and how can
we tell? If all our words are designed for other things, and
transferred metaphorically to God, will there be any content left in
what we claim to know or to believe about God? All Muslims agree that
God is one, and that there is no god but he. It is less clear what it
would mean for something to be a god other than God (since there
aren&rsquo;t any, and presumably it is a <em>necessary</em> truth that
there aren&rsquo;t any), but one common way of interpreting
&ldquo;there is no god but God&rdquo; is as &ldquo;there is nothing
eternal&mdash;i.e., nothing that has existed from eternity&mdash;other
than God&rdquo;. But if, as almost everyone agrees, there is no change
in God, then it seems to follow, not only that God does not have parts
(if God has two hands, then he has always had two hands, and so a
plurality of beings has existed from eternity) but also that he has no
attributes other than his essence (if God is just, then he has always
been just, and so both God and his justice have existed from
eternity). And, as F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; suggests, there is an
especially serious issue about whether the physical world has existed
from eternity: if there is no change in God, then it seems to follow
that God&rsquo;s will and his action are eternally unchanging, so that
if God produces the world at time <i>t</i>, he has also been producing
the world from eternity before <i>t</i> and will be producing the
world to eternity after <i>t</i>. This would contradict not only the
straightforward meaning of saying that the world is created, but also
the standard Jewish and Christian and Muslim belief that there is
nothing existing from eternity other than God. And the issue is not
only about time, but also about modality: there seems to be a line of
argument starting from God&rsquo;s perfection, running through his
simplicity (the lack of any plurality in him) and unchangeability, and
concluding to God&rsquo;s lack of freedom to make the world if and
when and as he chooses.</p>

<p>
All of these are disputes that F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; claims to be
able to resolve by demonstrative methods. He is not the first to make
such claims. Each religious community, after discovering that these
disputes cannot be resolved simply by citing scripture or appealing to
authoritative religious leaders, tries to develop disciplines for
resolving these disputes by argument. In the Muslim community, the
most important such disciplines are <em>fiqh</em> [Islamic
jurisprudence] for practical and legal issues, and
<em>kal&acirc;m</em> [Islamic theology] for theoretical questions, not
only about God but also about human beings and the cosmos.
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; in his <em>Enumeration of the Sciences</em>
describes <em>kal&acirc;m</em> as </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
a disposition by which a human being is able to defend the specific
opinions and actions that the founder of the religion declared and to
refute by arguments whatever opposes it. (Butterworth 2001: 80) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <em>mutakallim&ucirc;n</em> (practitioners of
<em>kal&acirc;m</em>) are F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s ideological
opponents and professional rivals, and we should not trust what he
says about them, but his picture of <em>kal&acirc;m</em> will be
important for his picture of philosophy as an alternative.
<em>Kal&acirc;m</em>, as F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; understands it, is
community-relative: Muslim <em>kal&acirc;m</em> is directed toward the
opinions of Mu&#7717;ammad, Jewish <em>kal&acirc;m</em> toward the
opinions of Moses, neither simply toward objective truth.
<em>Kal&acirc;m</em> is not concerned simply to defend the opinions of
the founder against the opinions of people outside the community
(e.g., to defend Muslim monotheism against Manichean dualism): there
is also disagreement within the community, and each side will try to
show that the founder agreed with them, and to defend the opinion of
the founder, as they interpret it, against other parties within the
community. Whether against external or internal opponents, its method
is, as F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; understands it, dialectical: that is,
the <em>mutakallim</em> poses questions to his opponent and tries to
refute him whichever way he answers, using as premises for the
refutation whatever propositions the opponent will concede, either
because they are common opinions or because they are the opinions of
the opponent&rsquo;s own party. Although <em>kal&acirc;m</em> begins
as a method for refuting an opponent in face-to-face encounters, the
<em>mutakallim&ucirc;n</em> also try to apply the same method
constructively, to argue on behalf of the &ldquo;foundations of the
religion&rdquo; [<em>u&#7779;&ucirc;l al-d&icirc;n</em>] as they
understand them. These will be, as F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; says, the
opinions laid down by the founder of the religion, but the
<em>mutakallim&ucirc;n</em> stress the value of knowing these things
through reason or intelligence [<em>&#703;aql</em>] rather than
relying on a chain of human witnesses going back to the
 founder;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-rs-4" id="ref-rs-4">4</a>]</sup>
 and if we can know by reason rather than by testimony, e.g., that God
is just, we will also know what &ldquo;just&rdquo; <em>means</em> in
this assertion (e.g., does God&rsquo;s justice exclude his punishing
people for doing something they had no power not to do?). A fairly
standard list of topics to treat by <em>kal&acirc;m</em> in this way
is: that there is a divine maker of the world, that he has neither a
partner nor a contrary, God&rsquo;s attributes and their relation to
his essence, God&rsquo;s acts and their relations to the acts of
humans or other creatures (e.g., does God create human acts or do
humans create their own acts), prophecy (and how to prove that some
particular person is a prophet), imamate (the conditions for someone
to be a legitimate successor to a prophet as the leader of his
community), and &ldquo;return&rdquo; [<em>ma&#703;&acirc;d</em>] (the
state of a human being after death, and divine rewards and
punishments). This is the model for the order of topics that
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; himself will follow in his <em>Principles of
the Opinions of the People of the Perfect City</em>, discussed
below.</p>

<p>
The problem is that different schools of <em>kal&acirc;m</em> reach
contradictory results, and have no agreed criterion for adjudicating
between them: their disputes seem just as irresolvable as the disputes
between different religious communities, or different parties within a
religious community, that they were trying to resolve. From
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s point of view, this is just what we
would expect, since (he would say) <em>kal&acirc;m</em> arguments are
dialectical arguments, whose premisses are drawn from common opinions
or from the opponents&rsquo; own claims, rather than the demonstrative
arguments which according to Aristotle yield scientific knowledge; and
it is possible to argue dialectically, but not demonstratively, for
pairs of contradictory conclusions. For F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;, the
real trouble is that, when people&rsquo;s hopes that
<em>kal&acirc;m</em> arguments will produce knowledge are shaken by
the experience of contrary arguments, they may lose faith in the power
of reason to resolve disputes: they may conclude that any argument has
an equally good counterargument, or anyway a counterargument good
enough that we cannot rationally adjudicate between them. This is
precisely the situation that Greek philosophy, and in particular Plato
and Aristotle, are supposed to rescue us from. The rescue will fail if
it turns out that Plato and Aristotle contradict each other, for
instance on the question of the eternity of the world: if they do, the
people of F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s time will conclude that
Plato and Aristotle have not, as they claim, given demonstrative
arguments, but have simply given more dialectical arguments on both
sides of a question; in which case Plato and Aristotle will not have
given us reason to believe their claim that philosophy allows us to
give demonstrative arguments and so to resolve the apparently
irresolvable disputes about fundamental questions.
(F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; could have tried saying that Aristotle has
given demonstrative arguments, including for the eternity of the
world, and that Plato has given merely dialectical arguments for the
opposite conclusions. There are some incidental reasons why he does
not take this path&mdash;it might undermine the confidence in ancient
Greek sages that could be conveyed by a united front, and some of
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s late ancient sources had given
similar harmonizations&mdash;but there are also deeper reasons why
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s project would be in difficulty if it
took this path.)</p>

<p>
For Arabic-readers of F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s time, the texts
of Greek philosophy have been preserved, in translations or in looser
summaries, by the mainly Syriac-speaking Christian communities within
the Islamicate world. Syriac-speaking Christian communities when they
were governed by the Eastern Roman Empire included people who studied
philosophy in Greek, and who sometimes came back to teach philosophy
in Syriac in their own communities, and they continued to do
philosophy in Syriac after the Islamic conquest, when they had become
part of a larger dominantly Arabic-speaking and Muslim society, and
when their links with the Greek language and with living
Greek-speaking communities had become very weak. And gradually they
start operating in Arabic, as they become more integrated into an
Arabic-speaking society and as the larger society beyond their own
community starts taking an interest in the Greek sciences, including
philosophy, which the Christians have preserved. Arabic-speaking
Muslims could be interested in Greek philosophy for reasons having
nothing to do with religion&mdash;for instance, because they were
interested in Galenic medicine and Galen presented philosophy as the
foundation of medical science. But F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; is not the
first Muslim to hope that the discipline of philosophy, preserved by
the Christians, could also give demonstrations that would resolve the
disputes about the foundations of religion (proving the existence of
God and the denial of a partner or contrary, giving the right
understanding of God&rsquo;s attributes and acts and causal relations
with the world, the immortality and happiness or misery of the human
soul, etc.) that were of concern to the Muslim community. But he
thinks that previous attempts have not yielded genuine demonstrations
or genuinely resolved the disputes; worse, they may convince people
that philosophy, the discipline practiced by the Greeks (and named in
Arabic by words derived from the Greek word
&ldquo;<em>philosophia</em>&rdquo;), is no more demonstrative than the
native Arabic Muslim discipline of <em>kal&acirc;m</em>, so that
importing this foreign discipline will not help to solve the problems
of the community. So it is very important for F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;
to distinguish what he is doing, not only from <em>kal&acirc;m</em>,
but also at earlier attempts at philosophy in the Islamicate
world&mdash;yes, these degenerate heirs of the Greeks produced only
dialectical arguments, but Plato and Aristotle had demonstrative
science, and I, F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;, have gone back to the source
and recaptured the ability to produce demonstrations, and to discern
when an argument is demonstrative and when it is merely dialectical or
sophistical or rhetorical. He manages to preserve almost complete
silence about the two main earlier Muslim philosophers, al-Kind&icirc;
and Ab&ucirc; Bakr al-R&acirc;z&icirc;, although he must have known
their work and often seems to have them in mind (the one explicit
mention that has been found in F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s corpus
is a criticism of a <em>musical</em> text of
 Kind&icirc;&rsquo;s);<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-rs-5" id="ref-rs-5">5</a>]</sup>
 instead he speaks only of Christian philosophers within the
Islamicate world. And he claims that the Christians stopped their
study of Aristotle with the <em>Prior Analytics</em> (indeed with
<em>Prior Analytics</em> I,1-7, before Aristotle&rsquo;s discussion of
modality), i.e., that they stopped short before encountering the
demonstrative method given in the <em>Posterior Analytics</em>,
supposedly because it would endanger the doctrines of their
 community.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-rs-6" id="ref-rs-6">6</a>]</sup>
 F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; himself, as a Muslim student of Christian
teachers, claims to be the first person to have mastered the
<em>Posterior Analytics</em>, or as he (like late ancient Greek
writers) calls it, the <em>On Demonstration</em>. He is also
implicitly contrasting himself with doctor-philosophers like Ab&ucirc;
Bakr R&acirc;z&icirc; who had drawn on Galen&rsquo;s <em>On
Demonstration</em>: the suggestion is that Galen&rsquo;s methods are
good enough for doctors but do not yield real demonstrations by
Aristotelian
 standards.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-rs-7" id="ref-rs-7">7</a>]</sup></p>
 
<p>
F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; is hoping to normalize philosophy in the
larger Muslim society, breaking its association with the Christian
community. He wants to show that it can do successfully what
<em>kal&acirc;m</em> tried and (in F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s
view) failed to do: namely, by giving demonstrative arguments, to
resolve disputes about fundamental religious questions, and thereby
also to determine the correct meaning of authoritative religious
assertions. (For instance, when the Qur&#702;&acirc;n attributes a
certain predicate to God, what is the meaning of that predicate-term?
If philosophy can determine what attributes God has, and if we add the
premise that Qur&#702;&acirc;n must be right, we can determine what it
means by these terms.) In that sense F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; is
trying to establish philosophy as a &ldquo;religious science&rdquo;
[<em>&#703;ilm al-d&icirc;n</em>] within Islam, competing with
<em>kal&acirc;m</em> and the other already established religious
sciences. But while F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; treats
<em>kal&acirc;m</em> as community-relative, philosophy will not be
community-relative, and will not be restricted to Muslims any more
than to Christians, or to Arabic-speakers any more than to Greek- or
Syriac-speakers: it is supposed to be an objective demonstrative
science (or group of related sciences) accessible to people in any
linguistic and religious community, and if it gives the &ldquo;inner
meaning&rdquo; of authoritative Muslim religious texts, that will be a
meaning that they share with non-Muslim texts. The Arabic grammarian
S&icirc;r&acirc;f&icirc;, in a debate on the comparative merits of
grammar and logic, had accused F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc;&rsquo;s
Christian teacher Ab&ucirc; Bishr Matt&acirc;, not only of not knowing
the rules of the language in which he had to express himself, Arabic,
but also of being captive to the grammar of another language he did
not know, Greek: according to S&icirc;r&acirc;f&icirc;, what Ab&ucirc;
Bishr Matt&acirc; presents following Aristotle as universal rules of
logic, normative for any rational being, are simply rules of Greek
grammar, as translated from Greek through Syriac into Arabic and
probably damaged in
 translation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-rs-8" id="ref-rs-8">8</a>]</sup>
 Against this charge, F&acirc;r&acirc;b&icirc; wants to show that
logic, and philosophy is general, is not community-bound like Arabic
grammar or Muslim <em>kal&acirc;m</em>. Logic is to thought as the
grammar of a particular language is to that language: its rules apply
to all thought insofar as it is correct, whatever language it may be
expressed in, and they give the common core shared by all languages,
abstracted from the merely conventional and community-relative aspects
of particular languages. And philosophy, including metaphysics,
physical cosmology, and moral-political philosophy, is to religion as
logic is to grammar, giving rules for how to think about God and the
physical world and human beings, and therefore for how to act to
achieve the aim of human life, which apply to all humans insofar as
they reason and act correctly; and these rules give the common core of
doctrines and practical prescriptions shared by all religions, or at
least by a plurality of correct
 religions,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-rs-9" id="ref-rs-9">9</a>]</sup>
 abstracted from the merely conventional and community-relative
aspects of particular religions.</p>

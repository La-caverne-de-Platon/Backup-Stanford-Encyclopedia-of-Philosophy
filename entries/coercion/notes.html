<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Coercion</a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>
 For now the
notion of a threat will be left undefined, but see note 6 below, as
well as the discussion of current disputes over the nature of threats
in section II B-D.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>
 Aquinas'
view here is quite complicated, in that he distinguishes the
voluntariness of the particular act done from fear from the
involuntariness of acting from fear more generally. (See Aquinas 1920
[1273], I.II Q6 A6.)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>
 No instances
appear in his <em>Two Treatises of Government</em> where his political
views are most thoroughly spelled out. All told, throughout
Locke's public writings there are just a handful of instances of
terms &ldquo;coercion&rdquo; and &ldquo;coerce&rdquo; in the <em>Essays
on the Law of Nature</em>, and &ldquo;coercive&rdquo; in &ldquo;A Third
Letter for Toleration.&rdquo; His uses in these contexts seem
consistent with, e.g., Hobbes's use of the term
&ldquo;coercive&rdquo; in the <em>Leviathan</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>
 The first part
of the <em>Metaphysics of Morals</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>
 Although these
conditions are framed in terms of keeping someone from doing something,
they are intended to cover inducing someone to take an action, as
well.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>
 The word
&ldquo;threat&rdquo; in English seems to have two different senses,
corresponding to two different purposes one might have in making a
threat. One sense picks out claims in which one agent advertises that
he will effect adverse consequences on another at some point in the
future. &ldquo;I'm going to kill you,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;you'll pay for that,&rdquo; are threats in this sense. A
different sense picks out claims made by one agent to motivate another
into action by linking the latter's conduct to the possibility of
adverse consequences the former may or will effect as a result.
&ldquo;If you touch that, I'll slug you,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;violators will be prosecuted,&rdquo; are examples of this latter
sort. &ldquo;Threats&rdquo; in this sense are almost always susceptible
of a conditional analysis (where the antecedent makes reference to the
conduct of the threat's recipient), but not all conditional
threats are motivational in character. &ldquo;If it rains tomorrow,
I'll kill you&rdquo; does not apparently aim to motivate action
by the threat's recipient. (A similar distinction can be made
amongst senses of the term &ldquo;offer.&rdquo;) From hereon in this
entry, &ldquo;threat&rdquo; and &ldquo;conditional threat&rdquo; will
be used interchangeably, and will refer exclusively to claims made with
a motivational purpose. This usage reflects standard practice in the
contemporary coercion literature. I will use &ldquo;unconditional
threat&rdquo; to pick out the former, non-motivational sense, where it
is understood that they may in fact be conditional in form, though not
conditioned on conduct by its recipient.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
 One might note
that this way of using the term &ldquo;proposal,&rdquo; although common
in this literature, is rather at odds with most ordinary uses. The
point of adopting this terminology seems to be that it helps bring out
similarities in the way coercion and ordinary offers both alter the
coercee's payoff structure for acting. But whereas our ordinary
understanding of proposals might be thought to include that it is open
to the recipient either to accept or reject them, the notion of
coercion might be thought to imply that, in some way, it is not open to
the coercee to reject it.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>
 One might also
wish to include in this latter sort of coercion direct destructive
actions against a person's property taken with an aim to alter or
constrain what the property owner or user is able to do.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>
 It is worth
emphasizing that the preference depicted here is comparative, to be
expressed between the two consequents, and does not suggest that one
consequent must be desired (<em>ceteris paribus</em>) while the other
must be disvalued (<em>ceteris paribus</em>). If the proposal is an
offer, one likely wants the offer to be made &ndash; that is, that the
conditional with the preferred consequent govern the possibilities for
action; but one may be indifferent to whether the conditional with the
less-preferred consequent be operable or not. Similarly, if a proposal
is a threat, one wishes that the conditional with the least favored
consequent were not operative; it may be a matter of indifference,
however, whether the other conditional is operative or not.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>
 The other
case is that of a drug dealer who threatens to withhold drug sales from
one of his regular, addicted customers, unless the customer agrees to
carry out an assault on a target the dealer has chosen.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>
 It is hard
to say, using just Gorr's stated principles and discussion of
cases, whether he would grant that the examples here would count as
coercive on his account. Gorr attempts to constrain what sorts of
preferences might count for purposes of setting the baseline; for
instance, he requires that Q's preferences range over P's
actual possible acts, and not over P's omissions (otherwise, the
shopkeeper's omitting to give away goods for free would count as
a threat to deprive someone of such goods). On similar grounds, Gorr
also requires that &ldquo;it is not the case that Q desires that P not
bring about <em>A</em> solely because P's bringing about
<em>A</em> would be incompatible with P's bringing about some
other state of affairs the obtaining of which Q does desire&rdquo;
(Gorr 1986, 388). The examples in the text here show that some
cases of ordinary interaction will likely slip past these constraints.
Even if he denies these, he admits overtly that he would count as
coercive the following situation: Suppose P has a habit, plan or
activity that Q dislikes or disapproves of severely, and P proposes to
cease such activity iff Q pays some sum. So if Jones disapproves of
Smith's TV watching, and Smith proposes to alter it for a fee,
this would be coercive. (See Gorr 1986, 391.)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>
 See
Wertheimer 1987; other notable moralized-baseline accounts include
Oberdiek 1976; Gunderson 1979; Raz 1986; Carr 1988; and
Hetherington 1999. In fairness to Wertheimer, he holds that there are
multiple baselines that are useful for evaluating coercion claims;
choosing which one to use depends on what is at issue in the claim.
However, it seems that to answer the questions we are most interested
in when discussing coercion &minus; e.g., when is it wrongful and when
does it alter coercee responsibility &minus; requires use of a
moralized baseline, on Wertheimer's analysis.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>
 The question
of what sort of action is required of the proposer to violate the
recipient's rights, or to make the recipient worse off than she
ought to be, is not without difficulty. Presumably failing to honor
one's contract could be the content of a possible threatened
consequence; but could failing to keep one's promise be?
Similarly, throwing someone overboard at sea would violate her rights,
but would refusing to save her (when it is easy to do, but not
something one has already agreed to do) also count as violating her
rights? If not, someone encountering a drowning person could demand an
exorbitant payment from her for an easy and riskless rescue without
thereby either threatening or, consequently, coercing her.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>
 In fairness
to Frankfurt, he also explains earlier in the same essay that coercive
threats need to meet three conditions: the coercee must be
<em>dependent</em> on the coercer in order to meet his <em>needs</em>,
a situation which the coercer then <em>exploits</em> (Frankfurt 1988
[1973], 71). This gives a very different picture of coercion from
the one normally associated with Frankfurt. However this analysis seems
to fall out of the picture in the second, more influential part of his
essay.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>
 This last
condition is actually part of a larger disjunct for Feinberg, the other
half of which allows that the coercer may be bluffing, and thus does
not actively do anything to constrain the coercee's options.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>
 It is worth
noting here, however, that Feinberg later seems to severely qualify or
even abandon this condition. He allows that one who makes a highly
exploitative offer (e.g., a lecherous millionaire who propositions a
woman in desperate financial straits) may still be engaging in coercion
even if the exploiter did nothing to create or perpetuate the
conditions he exploits.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>
 Wertheimer,
for one, would appear to agree with this claim, but find it
unproblematic. He is willing to accept that different moral tests apply
in different circumstances, and no one test will decide responsibility
in all kinds of cases, regardless of context.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>
 The law in
this area is, however, rather messy, and derives from a relatively
small number of actual cases at trial. For an insightful overview and
attempt at clarification of these issues, see Christie 1999.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a>
 A classic
philosophical example displaying a similar dynamic is Bernard
Williams' anecdote about Jim, the wayward botanist in South
America. Jim stumbles onto a military pogrom, and is given a choice of
shooting one villager after which nineteen others will be released
unharmed, or washing his hands of the business and letting the lot of
twenty be shot by someone else. While some would suggest that if he
chooses to shoot one, his responsibility is limited by virtue of being
justified; one might suggest that either course Jim takes, he should be
relieved of responsibility for any of the consequences on grounds that
the consequences that become attached to his decision depend wholly on
the will of someone else who attaches them. (See Williams 1973.)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>
 When one
makes a conditional threat, one can often convert the possibility of
carrying out a harmful action into a means for extracting benefits from
or constraints on action by the threatened party. By contrast,
unconditional threats may instill fear in that party, but ultimately
they are of little consequence unless one actually carries through on
the unconditional threat, in which case the utility of making the
unconditional threat may be dubious; issuing it in advance of
attempting to bring about those consequences may just make it easier
for its recipient to prepare for and avoid the advertised harmful
consequence.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>
 These
difficulties have been explored more thoroughly by those interested in
strategic defense and game theory. For instance, see Kavka 1978.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>
 And making a
proposal <em>per se</em> is not necessarily problematic at all: one
might, e.g., &ldquo;propose&rdquo; legislation for the purpose of
forcing one's fellow legislators to put their opposition to it on
the record.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a>
 These might
include communicating easily with other inmates or learning the rules
of the yard. The point is not that these are as desirable as the
options open to non-inmates, but simply that there are no strictly
numerical ways of making this comparison that will capture what we
think is important about freedom.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a>
 One might
suggest that one could judge the difference in freedom between the
inmate and the unincarcerated by simply asking whether they would
rather be in the other's place; presumably the answer is yes for
the inmate, and no for the unincarcerated. But one can't be sure
that people will always prefer more freedom to less. One might, for
instance, join the military to gain the discipline that comes from
having many fewer options than one has in civilian life. So preferences
do not always mirror assessments of the amount of freedom two options
entail.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a>
 These
include whether or when a state is justified in using coercion for
purposes such as welfare promotion, paternalistic aims, and to foster
general cooperation. Similarly, questions about whether coercive states
are to be preferred to anarchy or whether coercion (as it is usually
conceived) is essential to state function are not resolvable through
the narrower consideration of coercion itself. For a discussion of a
variety of possible connections between law, states, and coercion, see
Lamond 2001, pp. 42-45.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a>
 This
difficulty is not dependent on whether one accepts a baseline approach.
Both Wertheimer's (1987) baseline approach and Haksar's
(1976) non-baseline approach lead to the result that Edmundson (1995)
trumpets.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a>
 There are
two different reasons one might support such coercion against oneself.
First, we could well assume that the criminal law must be general in
form and in its use of coercive threats if it is to be practicable. One
may of course wish that the laws applied only to everyone
<em>else</em>, yet one might well support the imposition of a law that
coerced oneself into doing what one would otherwise avoid, on the
condition that such a use of coercion applied across the board. But
secondly, one may also want to be subject to the criminal law oneself
in order to facilitate interaction with others who would otherwise have
reason to be wary or reticent in their dealings with one. Just as
signing a contract gives others assurances of one's future
actions, being subject to the coercive criminal law allows others a
measure of assurance that one will act benignly towards them.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a>
 So, Lamond
argues, the law's authorization of coercive means is what makes
it coercive, &ldquo;irrespective of who is to carry them out&rdquo;
(Lamond 2000: p. 40).</p>

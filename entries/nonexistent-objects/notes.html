<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Nonexistent Objects</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a> This distinction can be
interpreted in one of two ways: According to one interpretation,
&ldquo;exists&rdquo; expresses one mode of being and &ldquo;there
is&rdquo; another. (For a critique of modes of being distinctions see
Reicher 2005a.) According to another interpretation, however,
&ldquo;exists&rdquo; expresses the only mode of being and &ldquo;there
is&rdquo; has no ontological import whatsoever.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a> The view that quantification is ontologically neutral is also held by Tim Crane (see Crane 2013, Chap. 2). Some claim that
Meinongians (and even Meinong himself) are not ontologically committed
to nonexistent objects (see, for instance, Priest 2005). Obviously,
whether or not this is correct depends not the least upon the question
of what exactly it means to be ontologically committed to something,
which leads into a highly subtle, complex and controversial debate
that cannot be pursued here. (For a contribution to this debate
see Reicher 2005a.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a> A similar view is held by
the 18th century philosopher Thomas Reid (see Reid 1785). Reid&rsquo;s view
is discussed and compared with the views of Brentano, Meinong, Findlay
and Anscombe in Prior 1971.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a> Thus, Tim Crane states:
&ldquo;[&hellip;] I have come to realize that unless we understand non-existence
we cannot understand intentionality&rdquo; (Crane 2013, ix).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a> There is an alternative paraphrase of &ldquo;Pegasus doesn&rsquo;t exist&rdquo; put forward in Quine 1953: &ldquo;Nothing pegasizes.&rdquo; This is the result of transforming the singular term &ldquo;Pegasus&rdquo; into the general term &ldquo;to pegasize&rdquo;. The point of this is the same as the one of the Russellian paraphrase, namely to get rid of the empty singular term. Quine&rsquo;s proposal avoids some objections to Russell&rsquo;s theory (see below); yet it seems that the term &ldquo;to pegasize&rdquo; is in need of further analysis.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a> Let&rsquo;s assume for the
moment, in order to get a grip on the problem, that there is no
difference between &ldquo;<em>F</em>s exist&rdquo; and &ldquo;there
are <em>F</em>s&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a> For other formulations of the predication principle see Kit Fine&rsquo;s &ldquo;falsehood principle&rdquo; (Fine 1981), Plantinga&rsquo;s &ldquo;serious actualism&rdquo; (Plantinga 1983) and Williamson&rsquo;s &ldquo;being constraint&rdquo; (Williamson 2013).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a> This is not the place to
enter a discussion about the merits and drawbacks of various versions
of Free Logics. It must be sufficient for the present purpose to note
that both (EG) and (PP) have an extraordinary degree of <em>prima
facie</em> plausibility. Therefore, they should not be given up
lightly.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a> Crane (2013) proposes such a &ldquo;reductionist&rdquo; solution. For details, see Section 5.1 below. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a> Sometimes, advocates of
the story operator strategy use an unspecified story operator
&ldquo;according to a story&rdquo; (in the sense of &ldquo;according
to one story or another&rdquo;).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a> Yet, (1&prime;)
may be taken to imply</p>

<blockquote>

(2&prime;) According to the story <em>S</em>: There are flying
horses.</blockquote>

<p>

and</p>

<blockquote>

(3&prime;) According to the story <em>S</em>: Pegasus
exists.</blockquote>

<p>

These implications, however, are unproblematic, for they do not
contradict &ldquo;There are no flying horses&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pegasus
does not exist&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a> A defense of a
generalized operator strategy is to be found in Brock 2002.  Brock&rsquo;s
operator, however, is not a story operator but something one might
call a &ldquo;theory (or belief) operator&rdquo;. It reads:
&ldquo;according to the realist&rsquo;s hypothesis&rdquo; (where &ldquo;the
realist&rsquo;s hypothesis&rdquo; is the assumption that there are
fictitious objects). This strategy is not susceptible to the above
objection, but it is doubtful whether it does justice to the
intuitions that govern realism with respect to fictitious objects. The
same holds true of the account in Everett 2005, which says that both
authors and literary critics engage in some sort of
&ldquo;pretense&rdquo;. Both Brock&rsquo;s and Everett&rsquo;s position are
versions of &ldquo;fictionalism&rdquo;. (For more on fictionalism 
see Section 5.1 below and the entry on
 <a href="../fictionalism/index.html">fictionalism</a>.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a> Throughout the whole
entry, non-annotated premises are what we take to be prima facie
truths.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a> Graham Priest would even
deny that 1 (&ldquo;Pegasus is a flying horse&rdquo;) implies
&ldquo;There are flying horses&rdquo;. He would claim, instead, that 1
implies &ldquo;For some <em>x</em>, <em>x</em> is a flying
horse&rdquo;. Whether this is more than a linguistic difference
depends, of course, partly on how &ldquo;there is&rdquo; is
interpreted. (See note 1.)</p> 
</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a> Note that analogous
considerations hold for the principle of existential
generalization. (EG) had been formulated as</p>

<blockquote>

(EG) <em>Fb</em> &rarr; &exist;<em>x</em>(<em>Fx</em>)</blockquote>

<p>

and the following reading had been suggested:</p>

<blockquote>

(EGa) If <em>b</em> is <em>F</em>, then there is something that is
<em>F</em>.</blockquote>

<p>

This reading can be (and is) accepted by a Meinongian. However, a
Meinongian cannot accept</p>

<blockquote>
(EGb) If <em>b</em> is <em>F</em>, then <em>F</em>s
exist.</blockquote>

</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a> The idea of fictitious objects as created artefacts occurs for the first time (though presented in an unfamiliar terminology) in Roman Ingarden&rsquo;s  <em>Das literarische Kunstwerk</em> (originally published in 1931; English translation: Ingarden 1973) and then in MacDonald 1954, Ferrater-Mora 1976/77, and van Inwagen 1977. More recently, creationist accounts can be found, among others, in Fine 1984, Salmon 1998, Thomasson 1999, Voltolini 2006, Reicher 2010. For a criticism of creationism see, e. g., Kroon 2011.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a> An anonymous referee
drew my attention to the fact that this proposal involves a
potentially confusing asymmetry. For if we use &ldquo;there is&rdquo;
as the neutral quantifier (i.e., as the quantifier that expresses
being but not existence), as Meinongians usually do, then, <em>prima
facie</em>, &ldquo;there was&rdquo; should be restricted to things
that <em>were</em> (i.e., had being) at some time in the past, not to
things that <em>existed</em> at some time in the past. However, for a
Meinongian, it would not make sense to understand &ldquo;there
was&rdquo; in this way. For, according to the Meinongian, an object
can gain and lose <em>existence</em>, but an object cannot gain and
lose <em>being</em>. Therefore, the domain of things that had being
in the past is co-extensional with the domain of things that have
being now. Therefore, if &ldquo;there was&rdquo; were used as
quantifier for everything that had being in the past, it would not be
restricted at all.  A Meinongian who is sympathetic to the idea of
restricted quantification but wishes to avoid the unpleasant asymmetry
pointed out above perhaps could do so by rendering past tense
sentences formally as involving an untensed neutral quantifier plus a
tensed existence predicate. &ldquo;Dinosaurs existed&rdquo; could thus
be rendered as &ldquo;There is an x such that (Dinosaur)x and
(Existed)x&rdquo;, where &ldquo;there is&rdquo; is the usual untensed
and unrestricted neutral quantifier, and &ldquo;(Existed)&rdquo; is a
tensed existence predicate. </p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a> A proponent of a
Meinongian solution to the problem of past and present objects is Mark
Hinchliff in his dissertation <em>A Defense of Presentism</em>, according to Markosian 2004.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a> For a critical
discussion of such a view, see Weinberg 2013. Weinberg argues,
convincingly, that &ldquo;interests are contingent upon
existence&rdquo; and thus, that &ldquo;[i]f a hypothetically possible
person will never exist then there is no real subject for interests at
all.&rdquo; (Weinberg 2013, 473) A related debate concerns the
question of whether one can reasonably attribute a certain degree of
wellbeing to nonexistent people. (See Herstein 2013. Herstein answers
this question negatively.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a> At least, this is one
of the possible interpretations of what the object called
&ldquo;<em>blue</em>&rdquo; is, according to MOT<sup>o</sup>.
Alternatively, one might interpret the object <em>blue</em> as
&iota;<em>x</em>&forall;<em>F</em>(<em>Fx</em> &equiv; <em>B</em>
&rArr; <em>F</em>), i.e., as the object that has all and only those
properties that are implied by the property of being blue (like being
colored, for instance). It is difficult to decide whether
Meinong, in the early version of his theory of objects, intended the
object <em>blue</em> to be interpreted one way or the other. Since
this question is of merely historical interest, we&rsquo;ll assume, for
the sake of convenience, that according to MOT<sup>o</sup> the first
interpretation is the correct one and leave the more complex
interpretation for later (see section 5.4).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a> Incomplete objects
violate the principle that for every property <em>P</em> and every
object <em>x</em>, either <em>x</em> exemplifies <em>P</em> or
<em>x</em> exemplifies the negation of <em>P</em>. But incomplete
objects do not violate the principle that for every property
<em>P</em> and every object <em>x</em>, either <em>x</em> exemplifies
<em>P</em> or <em>x</em> does not exemplify <em>P</em> (i. e., the principle of excluded middle). However, Anthony Everett has argued that there may be special cases of fictitious objects which violate the latter principle, which would, if true, constitute a serious objection against fictional realism (see Everett 2005 and 2013). Several authors have defended fictional realism against Everett&rsquo;s objections by proposing ways to avoid the violation of the principle of excluded middle even in Everett&rsquo;s examples of outlandish fictions (see Schnieder and von Solodkoff 2008, Voltolini 2010, Milne 2013, Murday 2015).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a> The distinction
between complete and incomplete objects resolves certain puzzles in
connection with fictitious objects: How many hairs are there in
Pegasus&rsquo;s tail? What was the shoe size of Sherlock Holmes&rsquo;
grand-grandmother? (We suppose that the respective stories do not give
us any hint with respect to these questions.)  &mdash; The Meinongian
answer is simple and plausible: Pegasus is not determined with respect
to the exact number of hairs in its tail.  Sherlock Holmes is not
determined with respect to the shoe size of his grand-grandmother. In
general, fictitious objects are highly incomplete.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a> For Russell&rsquo;s
criticism of MOT<sup>o</sup> see Russell 1973a, 1973b, and
1973c. Meinong defended himself in Meinong 1973. His reply to Russell
can be plausibly interpreted as an anticipation of a revised version
of MOT<sup>o</sup> (see Rapaport 1978), which will be delineated in
section 5. For a detailed discussion of the Russell-Meinong
debate see Smith 1985, Griffin 1985&ndash;86, and Simons 1992.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a> Priest&rsquo;s book has been
widely received and there has been a considerable amount of
discussion about his theory. See, for instance, Hale 2007, Kroon 2012, Sauchelli 2012, and the <em>Book
Symposium</em> in <em>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</em>
76 (2008), which consists of contributions by Daniel Nolan, Frederick
Kroon, and, of course, Priest&rsquo;s replies.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a> Although Priest does
not say so explicitly, one might suggest that they have properties
like <em>being round in some non-actual world</em>, <em>being a
detective in some non-actual world</em> etc. If so, his solution
becomes structurally similar to the dual copula strategy.  The problem
of the underdetermination of nonexistent objects in the actual world
is also broached in Nolan 2008 (191&ndash;193). Nolan argues that this problem is particularly pressing for objects of mathematics. Priest
replies to this in his Priest 2008.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a> Priest claims that non-actual worlds themselves are nonexistent objects. This view, together with what has been said above, seems to entail (although Priest does not say so explicitly) that nonexistent worlds are constituted (partly) by existent objects. For Pegasus, for instance,
exists in those worlds which are such as described in Greek mythology. Seemingly, it will not do to say that Pegasus does not &ldquo;really&rdquo; exist in those worlds (since those worlds are nonexistent), because Pegasus is said literally to <em>have</em> existence-entailing properties in those worlds, and if existence in a nonexistent world were not &ldquo;real&rdquo; existence, it seems that, consequently, objects existing in a nonexistent world could not literally have existence-entailing properties.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a> Priest himself discusses this and other problems of the application of his noneism to the topic of fictitious objects in Priest 2011. Note that Meinongianism in general (understood as the doctrine that there are objects that do not exist) is, in principle, neutral with respect to
the question of whether nonexistent objects are necessary or contingent objects. The versions of Meinongianism presented below are compatible with the view that Meinongian objects are created, though this is not the standard view among Meinongians. But Priest&rsquo;s noneism can in no way accommodate the &ldquo;creationist&rdquo; intuition, unless he abolishes the doctrine that the domain of discourse is the same in all possible (and impossible) worlds.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a> Originally, this distinction has been made by Ernst Mally, a disciple of Meinong, and Meinong adopted it for the mature version of object theory. Terence Parsons and Dale Jacquette are two contemporary proponents of this strategy. See Meinong 1972, Parsons 1980, Jacquette 1996, and also
Routley 1980.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a> However, there is no complete agreement among advocates of the nuclear-extranuclear distinction as to which properties are extranuclear. In contrast to Parsons, Dale Jacquette classifies intentional properties as nuclear. (Jacquette 1996, 73f.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a> We use the superscripts
&lsquo;<sup><em>n</em></sup>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<sup><em>e</em></sup>&rsquo; to indicate whether the properties in question are nuclear or extranuclear.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a> If we set aside the constitutive-consecutive distinction, we may interpret the object called &ldquo;blue&rdquo; as &iota;<em>x</em>&forall;<em>F<sup>n</sup></em>(<em>F<sup>n</sup>x</em> &equiv; <em>F<sup>n</sup></em> = <em>B<sup>n</sup></em>). This object
has exactly one nuclear property, namely the property of being blue. But this object too has infinitely many extranuclear properties, among them the property of having exactly one nuclear property. Thus the paradox is avoided in the same way as with
&iota;<em>x</em>&forall;<em>F<sup>n</sup></em>(<em>F<sup>n</sup>x</em> &equiv; <em>B<sup>n</sup></em> &rArr; <em>F<sup>n</sup></em>).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-32">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-32">32.</a> This doctrine raises a difficult question: what is the difference between an extranuclear property and its nuclear counterpart? For a discussion of this problem see Reicher 2005b.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-33">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-33">33.</a> However, MOT<sup>ne</sup> may be
made stronger by assuming that not only there is a nuclear counterpart
to every extranuclear property but that there is also <em>an
extranuclear counterpart to every nuclear property</em>.  (This
assumption is made in Parsons 1980, see p. 167.)  Of course, this
makes the problem of how to distinguish nuclear from extranuclear
properties even more pressing. But given that all properties come in
nuclear-extranuclear pairs, one might say: The round square
exemplifies only nuclear roundness and squareness, while every
existent square exemplifies extranuclear squareness. The (nonexistent)
golden mountain exemplifies only nuclear goldenness and mountainhood,
whereas every existent mountain exemplifies extranuclear
mountainhood. One might argue that the principle of contradiction
concerns extranuclear properties only and that a
thing&rsquo;s <em>nuclear</em> mountainhood does not entail that the
thing can be perceived and is located in space, since a thing that
exemplifies only nuclear mountainhood <em>is not</em> a mountain in
the usual sense. Such an extension of MOT<sup>ne</sup> would bring
MOT<sup>ne</sup> very close to the dual copula theory (see next
section).</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-34">34.</a> Like the nuclear-extranuclear distinction, this strategy too has been introduced first by Ernst Mally (see Mally 1912).  In contrast to the former, however, Meinong never adopted the dual-copula distinction.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-35">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-35">35.</a> Van Inwagen applies
this distinction exclusively to objects of fiction (in the narrower
sense, connected to the ontology of art), but in its function and
spirit it seems to be analogous to the ones of Mally and
Casta&ntilde;eda.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-36">
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-36">36.</a> According to the
interpretation adopted here, properties of the form &ldquo;encoding
being <em>F</em>&rdquo; can be exemplified by abstract objects only.
Alternatively, one might assume that, for instance, an existent
&ldquo;real&rdquo; human being exemplifies both the property of being
human and the property of encoding the property of being human, while
something that encodes being human without exemplifying this property
must be an abstract object.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-37">
<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-37">37.</a> An anonymous referee
suggested to me that fearing the devil might be analogous to fearing a
harmless snake that one mistakenly believes to be poisonous: although
the devil is in fact abstract (and therefore harmless), those who fear
&ldquo;him&rdquo; mistakenly believe that &ldquo;he&rdquo; is concrete
and dangerous. However, I do not believe that this analogy holds. As I
see it, those who fear the devil are not intentionally directed at an
abstract object that encodes being evil etc. Rather, they are directed
at a concrete object that <em>exemplifies</em> being evil. It is not
that they mistakenly attribute certain properties to an abstract
devil. Rather, they do not have an abstract devil as their intentional
object of fear in the first place.</p>

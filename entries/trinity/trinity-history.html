<h3><a name="Intro">1. Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
This supplementary document discusses the history of Trinity
theories. Although early Christian theologians speculated in many ways
on the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no one clearly and fully asserted
the doctrine of the Trinity as explained at the top of the main entry
until around the end of the so-called Arian Controversy. (See
 <a href="#325381AriCon">3.2 below</a>
and <a href="unitarianism.html#FouCenAriSub">section 3.1</a> of the
supplementary document on unitarianism.)  Nonetheless, proponents of such theories
always claim them to be in some sense founded on, or at least
illustrated by, biblical texts.</p>

<p>
Sometimes popular antitrinitarian literature paints &ldquo;the&rdquo;
doctrine as strongly influenced by, or even illicitly poached from
some non-Christian religious or philosophical tradition. Divine
threesomes abound in the religious writings and art of ancient Europe,
Egypt, the near east, and Asia. These include various threesomes of
male deities, of female deities, of Father-Mother-Son groups, or of
one body with three heads, or three faces on one head (Griffiths
1996). However, similarity alone doesn&rsquo;t prove Christian copying or
even indirect influence, and many of these examples are, because of
their time and place, unlikely to have influenced the development of
the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.</p>

<p>
A direct influence on second century Christian theology is the Jewish
philosopher and theologian Philo of Alexandria (a.k.a. Philo Judaeus)
(ca. 20 BCE&ndash;ca. 50 CE), the product of Alexandrian Middle Platonism
(with elements of Stoicism and Pythagoreanism). Inspired by
the <em>Timaeus</em> of <a href="../plato/index.html">Plato</a>, Philo read the
Jewish Bible as teaching that God created the cosmos by his Word
(<em>logos</em>), the first-born son of God. Alternately, or via
further emanation from this Word, God creates by means of his creative
power and his royal power, conceived of both as his powers, and yet as
agents distinct from him, giving him, as it were, metaphysical
distance from the material world (Philo <em>Works</em>; Dillon 1996,
139&ndash;83; Morgan 1853, 63&ndash;148; Norton 1859, 332&ndash;74; Wolfson 1973,
60&ndash;97).</p>

<p>Another influence may have been the Neopythagorean Middle Platonist
Numenius (fl. 150), who posited a triad of gods, calling them,
alternately, &ldquo;Father, creator and creature; fore-father,
offspring and descendant; and Father, maker and made&rdquo; (Guthrie
1917, 125), or on one ancient report, Grandfather, Father, and Son
(Dillon 1996, 367). Moderatus taught a similar triad somewhat earlier
(Stead 1985, 583).</p>

<p>Justin Martyr (d. ca. 165) describes the origin of
the <em>logos</em> (= the pre-human Jesus) from God using three
metaphors (light from the sun, fire from fire, speaker and his
speech), each of which is found in either Philo or Numenius (Gaston
2007, 53). Accepting the Philonic thesis that Plato and other Greek
philosophers received their wisdom from Moses, he holds that Plato in
his dialogue <em>Timaeus</em> discussed the Son (<em>logos</em>), as,
Justin says, &ldquo;the power next to the first God&rdquo;. And in
Plato&rsquo;s second letter, Justin finds a mention of a third, the Holy
Spirit (Justin, <em>First Apology</em>, 60). As with the Middle
Platonists, Justin&rsquo;s triad is hierarchical or ordered. And Justin&rsquo;s
scheme is not, properly, trinitarian. The one God is not the three,
but rather one of them and the primary one, the ultimate source of the
second and third.</p>

<p>Justin and later second century Christians influenced by Platonism
take over a concept of divine transcendence from Platonism, in light
of which</p>

<blockquote>no one with even the slightest intelligence would dare to
assert that the Creator of all things left his super-celestial realms
to make himself visible in a little spot on
earth. (Justin, <em>Dialogue</em>, 92 [ch. 60])</blockquote>

<p>Consequently, any biblical theophany (appearance of a god) on
earth, as well as the actual labor of creation, can&rsquo;t have been the
action of the highest god, God, but must instead have been done by
another one called &ldquo;God&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lord&rdquo;, namely
the <em>logos</em>, the pre-human Jesus, also called &ldquo;the angel
of the Lord&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Another influence may have been the Neoplatonist Plotinus&rsquo;
(204&ndash;70 CE) triad of the One, Intellect, and Soul, in which the
latter two mysteriously emanate from the One, and &ldquo;are the One
and not the One; they are the one because they are from it; they are
not the One, because it endowed them with what they have while
remaining by itself&rdquo; (Plotinus <em>Enneads</em>, 85). Plotinus
even describes them as three <em>hypostases</em>, and describes their
sameness using <em>homoousios</em> (Freeman 2003, 189). Augustine
tells us that he and other Christian intellectuals of his day believed
that the Neoplatonists had some awareness of the persons of the
Trinity (<em>Confessions</em> VIII.3; <em>City</em> X.23).</p>

<p>
Many thinkers influential in the development of trinitarian doctrines
were steeped in the thought not only of Middle Platonism and
Neoplatonism, but also the Stoics, Aristotle, and other currents in
Greek philosophy (Hanson 1988, 856&ndash;869). Whether one sees this
background as a providentially supplied and useful tool, or as an
unavoidably distorting influence, those developing the doctrine saw
themselves as trying to build a systematic Christian theology on the
Bible while remaining faithful to earlier post-biblical
tradition. Many also had the aim of showing Christianity to be
consistent with the best of Greek philosophy. But even if the doctrine
had a non-Christian origin, it would would not follow that it is false
or unjustified; it could be, that through Philo (or whomever), God
revealed the doctrine to the Christian church. Still, it is contested
issue whether or not the doctrine can be deduced or otherwise inferred
from the Christian Bible, so we must turn to it.</p>

<h3><a name="ChrBib">2. The Christian Bible</a></h3>

<h4><a name="OldTes">2.1 The Old Testament</a></h4>

<p>
No trinitarian doctrine is explicitly taught in the Old
Testament. Sophisticated trinitarians grant this, holding that the
doctrine was revealed by God only later, in New Testament times
(c.50&ndash;c.100) and/or in the Patristic era (c. 100&ndash;800).
They usually also add, though, that with hindsight, we can see that a
number of texts either portray or forshadow the co-working
of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>
For example, in Genesis 18, Yahweh appears to Abraham as three men,
and the text has often been read as though the men spoke as one, with
one voice. What is this, they urge, if not an appearance of, or even a
triple temporary incarnation of the three persons within God&rsquo;s nature?
(Other interpretations identify Yahweh with one of the men, the one
who stays behind while the others travel to Sodom in Genesis 19.)</p>

<p>
In numerous other passages, many Christian readers hold, the
preincarnate Son of God is mentioned, or even appears in bodily form
to do the bidding of his Father, and is (so they believe) sometimes
called the &ldquo;angel of the Lord&rdquo;. Some have even identified
the preincarnate Christ as Michael, protecting angel over Israel
mentioned in the books of Daniel, Jude, and Revelation.</p>

<p>
And in several passages, Yahweh refers to himself, or is referred to
using plural terms. Non-trinitarians usually read this as a plural of
majesty, a form of speech which occurs in many languages, or a
conversation between God and angels, while trinitarians often read this
as a conversation between the persons of the Trinity.</p>

<p>
In sum, Christians read the Old Testament through the lens of the
New. For example, the former speaks of God as
working by his &ldquo;word&rdquo;, &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;, or
&ldquo;spirit&rdquo;. Some New Testament passages call Jesus
Christ the word and wisdom of God, and in the Gospel of John, Jesus
talks about the sending of another comforter or helper, the
&ldquo;Holy Spirit&rdquo;. Thus, some Christians claim the door was
open to positing two divine intelligent agents in addition to
&ldquo;the Father&rdquo;, by, through, or in whom the Father acts, one
of whom was incarnated in the man Jesus. In opposition, other
Christian readers have taken these passages to involve
anthropomorphization of divine attributes, urging that Greek
speculations unfortunately encouraged the aforementioned
hypostasizations.</p>

<h4><a name="NewTes">2.2 The New Testament</a></h4>

<p>
The New Testament contains no explicit trinitarian doctrine. However,
many Christian theologians, apologists, and philosophers hold that the
doctrine can be inferred from what the New Testament does teach about
God. But how may it be inferred? Is the inference deductive, or is it
an inference to the best explanation? And is it based on what is
implicitly taught there, or on what is merely assumed there? Many
Christian theologians and apologists seem to hold it is a deductive
inference.</p>

<p>
In contrast, other Christians admit that their preferred doctrine of
the Trinity not only (1) can&rsquo;t be inferred from the Bible alone, but
also (2) that there&rsquo;s inadequate or no evidence for it there, and even
(3) that what is taught in the Bible is incompatible with the doctrine.
These Christians believe the doctrine solely on the authority of later
doctrinal pronouncements of the True Christian Church (typically one
of: the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox tradition, or the
mainstream of the Christian tradition, broadly understood). Some
Catholic apologists have argued that this doctrine shows the necessity
of the teaching authority of the Church, this doctrine being
constitutive of Christianity but underivable from the Bible apart from
the Church&rsquo;s guidance in interpreting it. This stance is not popular
among Christians who are neither Catholic nor Eastern Orthodox. (2)
would be the main sticking point, although some groups deny all three.</p>

<p>
Many Christian apologists argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is
&ldquo;biblical&rdquo; (i.e. either it is implicitly taught there, or
it is the best explanation of what is taught there) using three sorts
of arguments. They begin by claiming that the Father of Jesus Christ is
the one true God taught in the Old Testament. They then argue that
given what the Bible teaches about Christ and the Holy Spirit, they
must be &ldquo;fully divine&rdquo; as well. Thus, we must, as it were,
&ldquo;move them within&rdquo; the nature of the one God. Therefore,
there are three fully divine persons &ldquo;in God&rdquo;. While this
may be paradoxical, it is argued that this is what God has revealed to
humankind through the Bible.</p>

<p>
The types of arguments employed to show the &ldquo;full
divinity&rdquo; of Christ and the Holy Spirit work as follows.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>S</em> did action <em>A</em>.</li>
  <li>For any <em>x</em>, if <em>x</em> does
    action <em>A</em>, <em>x</em> is fully divine.</li>
  <li>Therefore, <em>S</em> is fully divine.</li>
</ol>

<p>
E.g., <em>A</em> = non-culpably pronouncing the forgiveness of sins,
non-culpably receiving worship, raising the dead, truly saying &ldquo;Before
Abraham was, I am&rdquo;, creating the cosmos.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Bible applies title or description &ldquo;<em>F</em>&rdquo;
to <em>S</em>.</li>
  <li>For any <em>x</em>, if the Bible applies title
&ldquo;<em>F</em>&rdquo; to <em>x</em>, then <em>x</em> is fully
divine.</li>
  <li>Therefore, <em>S</em> is fully divine.</li>
</ol>

<p>
E.g., <em>F</em> = the first and the last, a god, the God, our
savior</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>S</em> has quality <em>Q</em>.</li>
  <li>For any <em>x</em>, if <em>x</em> has quality <em>Q</em>, then <em>x</em> is fully divine.</li>
  <li><em>S</em> is fully divine.</li>
</ol>

<p>
E.g., <em>Q</em> = sinlessness, omniscience, the power to perform
miracles, something Christians should be baptized in the name of</p>

<p>
While such arguments are deductively valid, they suffer from a
crucial ambiguity: What is meant by &ldquo;fully divine&rdquo;? Until
this is made clear, it isn&rsquo;t clear which of the trinitarian theories is
being argued for. A person being &ldquo;fully divine&rdquo; might,
according to various theorists, amount to being constituted by the
matter-like divine nature, being identical to God, being a mind of God,
being a way God relates to himself or the world, and so on. Further,
the epistemic status of each argument&rsquo;s second premise may depend on what
&ldquo;divine&rdquo; means.</p>

<p>
Opponents of these sorts of argument typically give biblical
counterexamples to the second premise (e.g., humans who are
called &ldquo;gods&rdquo; but aren&rsquo;t divine in the relevant sense,
humans who are authorized by God to forgive sins but aren&rsquo;t divine in
the relevant sense). In other cases, they also challenge the first
premise (e.g., Jesus denied being omniscient, there are inadequate
grounds to say that the Son of God created the cosmos).</p>

<p>
Another form of argument runs as follows.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Passage <em>E</em> is a true prophecy predicting that the God of Israel,
    Yahweh, will do action <em>A</em>.</li>
  <li>Passage <em>F</em> truly asserts that the prophecy in <em>E</em> was fulfilled in
    the life of Jesus Christ.</li>
  <li>Therefore, Jesus Christ just is the God of Israel, Yahweh.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Opponents reply that this argument is invalid; it is possible for the
premises to be true even though the conclusion is false. Even though the
prediction &ldquo;George W. Bush will conquer Iraq&rdquo; may be said
to be fulfilled by the actions of General Smith, it doesn&rsquo;t follow
that Smith and Bush are one and the same. Rather, Smith acted as the
agent of Bush. Similarly, Yahweh acts through his servant Jesus.
Another disadvantage of this argument is that even if it is sound, the
conclusion is undesirable. If Jesus and God are held to be
(numerically) identical, and one adds that the Father is &ldquo;fully
divine&rdquo; in this same sense, i.e. the Father is numerically
identical to God, then it logically follows that Jesus just is (is
numerically identical to) the Father. And yet, according to any
trinitarian, some things are true of one that are not true of the
other. This is why nearly all trinitarian theories decline to identify
more than one of the three persons with God. On the other hand, some
embrace this as a mystery &mdash;something which <em>appears</em>
contradictory but is in fact true. (See main entry
 <a href="index-2.html#PosMys">section 4.2</a>.)</p>

<p>
This traditional case for the divinity of Jesus and the Holy Spirit may
be best construed not as a collection of deductive arguments, but
rather as an inference to the best explanation, an attempt to infer
what best explains all the biblical texts considered together. In this
genre, however, alternate explanations are rarely explored in any
detail, much less shown to be inferior.</p>

<p>
Many arguments of the above types date back to ancient times, and have
been repeated in similar forms whenever mainstream trinitarianism has
been attacked (Beckwith 2007; Bowman 2007; Bowman and Komoszewski
2007; George 2006; Stuart 1834; Waterland 1856a-e). A number of well
developed refutations of these arguments dating from the 17th to 19th
centuries have been largely forgotten by present-day theologians,
philosophers, and apologists (Burnap 1845; Clarke 1978;
Crellius <em>Racovian</em>; Crellius 1691; Emlyn 1746; Haynes 1797; Lardner 1793;
Lindsey 1776, 1818; Norton 1859; Nye 1691b; Priestley 1791a-c; Wilson
1846).</p>

<p>Early Christianity was theologically diverse, although as time went
on a &ldquo;catholic&rdquo; movement, a bishop-led, developing
organization which, at least from the late second century, claimed to
be the true successors of Jesus&rsquo; apostles, became increasingly
dominant, out-competing many gnostic and quasi-Jewish groups. Still,
confining our attention to what scholars now call this
&ldquo;catholic&rdquo; or &ldquo;proto-orthodox&rdquo; Christianity,
it contained divergent views about the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit. No theologian in the first three Christian centuries was a
trinitarian in the sense of a believing that the one God is
tripersonal, containing equally divine &ldquo;persons&rdquo;, Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>The terms we translate as &ldquo;Trinity&rdquo;
(Latin: <em>trinitas</em>, Greek: <em>trias</em>) seem to have come
into use only in the last two decades of the second century; but such
usage doesn&rsquo;t reflect trinitarian belief. These late second and third
century authors use such terms not to refer to the one God, but rather
to refer to the plurality of the one God, together with his Son (on
Word) and his Spirit. They profess a &ldquo;trinity&rdquo;, triad or
threesome, but not a triune or tripersonal God. Nor did they consider
these to be equally divine. A common strategy for defending monotheism
in this period is to emphasize the unique divinity of the Father. Thus
Origen (ca. 186&ndash;255),</p>

<blockquote>The God and Father, who holds the universe together, is
superior to every being that exists, for he imparts to each one from
his own existence that which each one is; the Son, being less than the
Father, is superior to rational creatures alone (for he is second to
the Father); the Holy Spirit is still less, and dwells within the
saints alone. So that in this way the power of the Father is greater
than that of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and that of the Son is
more than that of the Holy Spirit&hellip; (Origen, <em>First</em>, 33&ndash;4
[I.3])</blockquote>

<p>Many scholars call this strain of Christian theology
&ldquo;subordinationist&rdquo;, as the Son and Spirit are always in
some sense derivative of, less than, and subordinate to their source,
the one God, that is, the Father. One may also call this theology
unitarian, in the sense that the one God just is the Father, and not
equally the Son and Spirit, so that the one God is
&ldquo;unipersonal&rdquo;.</p>

<p>While views about the Spirit remained comparatively undeveloped,
and as in the New Testament the Spirit was not worshiped, in the
second and third centuries catholic Christianity came to attribute a
&ldquo;a divine nature&rdquo; to Jesus, and to firmly establish his
being called &ldquo;God&rdquo;. Language which had been very unusual
in the first century (Harris 1992) now became the norm; Jesus was now
&ldquo;God&rdquo; or &ldquo;a god&rdquo;, but not the one true
God. (e.g. Novatian, <em>Trinity</em>, ch. 31; Justin <em>First</em>,
ch. 13) This divine Son (i.e. the pre-human Jesus) was mysteriously
&ldquo;generated&rdquo; by God either just before creation (late 2nd
to early 3rd c. &ldquo;logos theologians&rdquo; or in timeless
eternity (from Origen on).</p>

<p>While these developments were new, the worship of Jesus was not. As
against earlier theories that it developed only slowly and because of
Gentile influence, recent work has shown that Jesus was worshipped
alongside God in the earliest known Christianity (Hurtado 2003,
2005). While the basis cited for this practice in the New Testament is
God&rsquo;s post-resurrection exaltation of Jesus (Hurtado 2003, 640&ndash;1), it
was now assumed that its basis was Jesus&rsquo; having something divine
within him.</p>

<h5><a name="Tertul">3.1.2 Tertullian</a></h5>

<p>An important transitional figure is the pugnacious but
philosophically sophisticated Tertullian (ca. 160&ndash;225). He was pressed
on one side by catholic Christians who objected to late second century
logos christology on which the pre-human Jesus (the
&ldquo;Word&rdquo;, Greek: <em>logos</em> of John 1) was God&rsquo;s
instrument of creation. They considered this scheme of two creators
and a divine Jesus to be inconsistent with monotheism
(Tertullian <em>Praxeas</em>, ch. 3). He was pressed on the other side
by catholics now called &ldquo;monarchians&rdquo; who held that the
divine element in Jesus was the Father himself. Some of these thought
Jesus to be a man empowered and indwelt by God, while others thought
that Jesus and the Father were one and the same&mdash;the same self and
the same god (Heine 1998). Tertullian mocked as
&ldquo;patripassians&rdquo;, for the implication of (at least the
second sort of view) that the Father suffered when Jesus was
crucified, something widely assumed to be impossible.</p>

<p>In opposition to these he asserted and developed logos christology
in a unique way. Here is a graphic illustration of Tertullian&rsquo;s
trinity&mdash;not a triune God, but rather a triad or group of three, with
God as the founding member.</p>

<div class="figure">
 <img class="nocaption" width="550" src="Tertrin1.png" alt="A representation of the trinity of Tertullian" />
</div>

<p>Under the influence of Stoic philosophy, Tertullian believes that
all real things are material. God is a spirit, but a spirit is a
material thing made out of a finer sort of matter. At the beginning,
God is alone, though he has his own reason within him. Then, when it
is time to create, he brings the Son into existence, using but not
losing a portion of his spiritual matter. Then the Son, using a
portion of the divine matter shared with him, brings into existence
the Spirit. And the two of them are God&rsquo;s instruments, his agents, in
the creation and governance of the cosmos.</p>

<p>The Son, on this theory, is not God himself, nor is he divine in
the same sense that the Father is. Rather, the Son is
&ldquo;divine&rdquo; in that he is made of a portion of the matter
that the Father is composed of. This makes them &ldquo;one
substance&rdquo; or not different as to essence. But the Son isn&rsquo;t the
same god as the Father, though he can, because of what he&rsquo;s made of,
be called &ldquo;God&rdquo;. Nor is there any tripersonal God here,
but only a tripersonal portion of matter - that smallest portion
shared by all three. The one God is sharing a portion of his stuff
with another, by causing another to exist out of it, and then this
other turns around and does likewise, sharing some of this matter with
a third.</p>

<p>Against the common believers concerned with monotheism, Tertullian
argues that although the above process results in two more who can be
called &ldquo;God&rdquo;, it does not introduce two more gods - not
gods in the sense that Yahweh is a god. There is still, as there can
only be, one ultimate source of all else, the Father. Thus, monotheism
is upheld. The one God is unipersonal both at the start and the end of
this process. Nor are the persons equally divine; Tertullian holds
that the Son is &ldquo;ignorant of the last day and hour, which is
known to the Father only&rdquo; (Tertullian, <em>Praxeas</em>, ch. 27;
Matthew 24:36).</p>

<p>What is Tertullian&rsquo;s answer to his &ldquo;monarchian&rdquo;
critics? First, he strongly emphasizes that these are truly three;
none of the three is identical to any other. They are
&ldquo;undivided&rdquo; in the sense that the Father, in sharing some
of his matter, never loses any; rather, that matter comes to
simultaneously compose more than one being. The chart above might
suggest that this portion of matter is one thing with three parts; but
it is conceived of merely as a quantity of matter. The Father is one
entity, the Son is a second, and the Spirit is a third. Nor are they
parts of any whole; the latter two simply share some of the Father&rsquo;s
divine stuff. Tertullian does not argue that the three compose or
otherwise are the one God. Instead, Tertullian replies that a king may
share his one kingdom with subordinate rulers, and yet it may still be
one kingdom. Likewise, God (i.e. the Father) may share the governance
of the cosmos with his Son (<em>Praxeas</em>, ch. 4)</p>

<p>Despite these fundamental differences from later orthodoxy,
Tertullian is now hailed by trinitarians for his use of the term
&ldquo;Trinity&rdquo; (Latin: <em>trinitas</em>) and his view that it
(at the last stage) consists of three persons with a common or shared
&ldquo;substance&rdquo;.</p>

<h4><a name="325381AriCon">3.2 325&ndash;381: The Arian Controversy</a></h4>

<p>
It was only in response to the controversy sparked by the Alexandrian
presbyter Arius (ca. 256&ndash;336) that a critical mass of bishops
rallied around what eventually became standard language about the
Trinity. This controversy was complex, and has been much illuminated
by recent historians (Ayres 2004; Freeman 2008; Hanson 1988; Pelikan
1971; Rubenstein 1999; Williams 2001). It can be briefly summarized as
follows. Arius taught, in accordance with an earlier subordinationist
theological tradition, that the Son of God was a creature, made by God
from nothing a finite time ago. Some time around 318&ndash;21 a
controversy broke out, with Arius&rsquo; teaching opposed initially by his
bishop Alexander of Alexandria (d. 326). Alexander examined and
excommunicated Arius. Numerous churchmen, adhering to subordinationist
traditions about the Son rallied to Arius&rsquo; side, while others,
favoring theologies holding to the eternal existence of the Son and
his (in some sense) ontological equality with the Father, joined his
opponents. The dispute threatened to split the church, and a series of
councils ensued, variously excommunicating and vindicating Arius and
his defenders, or their opponents. Each side successively tried to win
the favor of the then-current emperor, trying to manipulate imperial
power to crush its opposition.</p>

<p>
From the standpoint of later catholic orthodoxy, a key episode in this
series occurred in 325, when a council of bishops convened by the
Emperor Constantine (ca.  280&ndash;337) decreed that the Father and
Son were <em>homoousios</em> (same substance or essence). Arius and
his party were excommunicated. The intended meaning of <em>ousia</em>
here was far from clear, given the term&rsquo;s complex history and use, and
the failure of the council to disambiguate it (Stead 1994,
160&ndash;72).  They most likely settled on the term because it was
disagreeable to the party siding with Arius. This new and ambiguous
formula fanned the flames of controversy, as subordinationists and
anti-subordinationists understood the phrase differently when signing
on to it, and later argued for conflicting interpretations of it.</p>

<p>
By the time of the council of Constantinople (381 CE), an
anti-subordinationist reading, vigorously championed by Alexandrian
bishop Athanasius (d. 373) had the upper hand; <em>homoousios</em> was
understood as asserting the Father and Son to not merely be similar
beings, but in some sense one being. While it stopped short of saying
that the Holy Spirit was <em>homoousios</em> with the Father and Son,
the council did say that the Holy Spirit &ldquo;is worshiped and
glorified together with the Father and the Son&rdquo;, and added in a
letter accompanying their creed that the three share &ldquo;a single
Godhead and power and substance&rdquo; (Leith 1982, 33; Tanner 1990,
24, 28).  Over the ensuing period the same sorts of arguments used to
promote the divinity of the Son, were reapplied to the Holy Spirit,
and eventually inhibitions to applying <em>homoousios</em> to the Holy
Spirit evaporated.</p>

<p>
Athanasius and others in the prevailing party argued that the
salvation of humans requires the Son and Holy Spirit to be equally
divine with the Father. This kind of argument depends on various
controversial models of salvation, such as the one on which salvation
involves the &ldquo;deification&rdquo; or &ldquo;divinization&rdquo; of
humans, which can only be accomplished by one who is himself divine
(Rusch 1980, 22&ndash;23). Despite shifting convictions about what salvation
is and how God accomplishes it, this basic sort of argument remains
popular&mdash;that if Christ and/or the Holy Spirit were not in some sense
&ldquo;fully divine&rdquo;, then humanity couldn&rsquo;t be saved by their
actions. (For an influential medieval argument, see Anselm <em>Cur</em>.)
Perhaps the most currently popular such argument is that our
forgiveness by God, an infinitely valuable being, requires an atoning
sacrifice of infinite value. Hence, Christ has to be fully divine, as
only a fully divine being has infinite value.</p>

<h4><a name="ProNicCon">3.3 The pro-Nicene Consensus</a></h4>

<p>
Around the time of the very messy Council of Constantinople (Freeman
2008, 91&ndash;104; Hanson 1988, 791&ndash;823), as imperial and ecclesial forces
began to systematically extinguish subordinationist groups in the
eastern and western empires (Wiles 1996, 27&ndash;40), the kind of
trinitarianism which finally prevailed within the mainstream
institutions of Christianity began to gel into a recognizable form.
Following Hanson (1988) and Ayres (2004) we call this the
&ldquo;pro-Nicene consensus&rdquo;. This consensus spanned the
east-west (Greek-Latin) divide.  Thus, to present this view we
summarize the accounts of two influential theorists, one from each
side of this cultural and linguistic divide: Gregory of Nyssa, and
Augustine of Hippo. </p>

<h5><a name="GreNys">3.3.1 Gregory of Nyssa</a></h5>

<p>
Gregory of Nyssa (ca. 335&ndash;ca. 395) is now known as one of the
Cappadocian Fathers, the other two being his older brother Basil of
Caesarea (ca. 329&ndash;79) and Gregory Nazianzus
(329&ndash;89). These three active bishops are credited with
establishing a consistent terminology for the Trinity, namely
using <em>hypostasis</em> or <em>prosopon</em> for what God is three
of, and <em>ousia</em> (along with <em>phusis</em>) for what God is
one of. (On their lives, careers, and extant writings, see Ayres 2004
and Hanson 1996.) We look briefly at Nyssa&rsquo;s views here, as
illustrating several points about the pro-Nicene consensus.</p>

<p>
Nyssa notoriously compares the Trinity to three human beings (Nyssa
<em>Answer</em>, 256). Largely on this basis, he (and the other
Cappadocians) have been interpreted as proto-social trinitarians (see
 <a href="index-2.html#20tCenThe">section 2.1</a> of the main text), holding
 the three persons to be three subjects of consciousness and action,
of the same kind, <em>homoousios</em> in the way that any two
examples of a natural kind are, such as two humans (Plantinga 1986).
However, it has been objected that the three human analogy was
suggested by his opponents; it is neither Nyssa&rsquo;s only nor his main
analogy for the Trinity (Coakley 1999).</p>

<p>
In Nyssa&rsquo;s letter <em>An Answer to Ablabius: That We Should Not Think
of Saying There are Three Gods</em> he responds to an objection passed
on by his correspondent, the younger bishop Ablabius: even though
three men share a single humanity, we call them &ldquo;three
men&rdquo;, so if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit share a single
divinity, why shouldn&rsquo;t we call them &ldquo;three gods&rdquo;?
(Nyssa <em>Answer</em>, 256&ndash;7) After a flippant answer, he
argues that both ways of speaking are on a par, but they are both
incorrect; that is, both talk of many gods and of many men involve
&ldquo;a customary misuse of language&rdquo; (257). In both cases, he
argues that the general term refers to the single, common nature. More
accurately, he adds, the term &ldquo;godhead&rdquo; refers only to a
divine operation of seeing or beholding, as &ldquo;His nature cannot
be named and is ineffable&rdquo; (259). Moreover, the Bible ascribes
this operation equally to each of the three (260). Does it not follow
that there are three seers, &ldquo;three gods who are beheld in the
same operation&rdquo; (261)? Nyssa argues that it does not.</p>

<blockquote>
  In the case of men&hellip; since we can differentiate the action of
  each while they are engaged in the same task, they are rightly
  referred to in the plural&hellip;.With regard to the divine nature,
  on the other hand, it is otherwise&hellip;.Rather does every
  operation which extends from God to creation&hellip; have its origin
  in the Father, proceed through the Son, and reach its completion by
  the Holy Spirit. For the action of each in any matter is not
  separate and individualized. But whatever occurs&hellip; occurs
  through the three Persons, and is not three separate
  things&hellip;.we cannot enumerate as three gods those who jointly,
  inseparably, and mutually exercise their divine power&hellip;
  (261&ndash;2; cf. 266, Nyssa <em>On the Holy Trinity</em>))
</blockquote>

<p>
We&rsquo;re unable to differentiate, Nyssa thinks, any distinct works of the
persons. The word &ldquo;deity&rdquo; (or &ldquo;Godhead&rdquo;)
signifies only a certain work. Therefore, we&rsquo;re unable to count, and
shouldn&rsquo;t speak of three distinct deities (261&ndash;4).</p>

<p>A problem with Nyssa&rsquo;s argument is that words like
&ldquo;work&rdquo;, &ldquo;operation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;action&rdquo;
can refer to either an activity (exercise of a thing&rsquo;s powers) or the
result thereof. Thus, a series of plannings and drawings, etc., or the
resulting building can be called what a certain architect did (or his
work, operation, action). And one thing or event may be the result of
a great many activities by different agents, as when dozens of
construction workers contribute their actions to one result, such as a
building (or the coming into existence of a building). Nyssa siezes on
examples of the actions of the Father, Son, and Spirit having a single
result. But though their &ldquo;operation&rdquo; (i.e. result) is one,
it doesn&rsquo;t follow that they or their actions are one. Moreover, Nyssa
speaks of the divine persons in the plural, and holds them to
differ. While the divine nature is &ldquo;undifferentiated&rdquo;, the
three persons differ causally.</p>

<blockquote>
To say that something [i.e. the Father] exists without generation
explains the mode of its existence. But what it is is not made evident
by the expression. (267)
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, while it is left unclear what the persons are, it is emphasized
that a distinction between them hasn&rsquo;t been obliterated. Being a
Platonist about universals, he holds that the Three share one
universal nature (i.e. deity). But he is hard pressed to show why it
doesn&rsquo;t follow that there are three gods (264&ndash;6). In the end, his main
aim is simply to uphold the mysterious tradition passed down to
him (257; cf. Nyssa <em>Great</em>, ch. 1&ndash;3).</p>

<p>
The bedrock of pro-Nicene trinitarianism is a metaphysics of God as
unique, simple (lacking any sort of parts, composition, or differing
intrinsic aspects), and therefore incomprehensible (we can&rsquo;t grasp all truths
about God, or any truths about God&rsquo;s essential nature) and ineffable
(such that no human concept applies literally to it). Thus as Ayres
notes,</p>

<blockquote>
  Pro-Nicenes assume that one can draw no analogies between God and
  creation that will either deliver knowledge of God&rsquo;s essence or that
  can involve us in grasping clearly where and why an analogy fails.
  (Ayres 2004, 284)
</blockquote>

<p>
Any analogy offered is therefore quickly supplemented by others. Its
opponents view this as obfuscation, while its proponents consider the
differing analogies to be complimentary and in some sense informative.
While pro-Nicenes hold the persons to be (somehow) distinct, they show
little interest in developing a metaphysical account of what it is to
be a divine person. In sum, the Nicene pattern of speech and thought
about the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is held by them to be
spiritually beneficial, but it doesn&rsquo;t admit of clarification. This
view is strongly mysterian (see main entry, section 3).</p>

<h5><a name="Aug">3.3.2 Augustine</a></h5>

<p>Augustine is arguably a one-self trinitarian. For him, the one God
is the Trinity. And this one God is almost always addressed and
described using personal pronouns. He is an object of our love, as
much as our neighbors and ourselves, and he has all the features of a
self described in the main entry, section 1.1. He is a simple,
timeless, and perfect self, a subject of complete knowledge, who
freely creates all other things, and who exists in a truer or deeper
way. The true believer can not say &ldquo;that there are not three
somethings [in the Trinity], because Sabellius fell into heresy by
saying precisely that.&rdquo; (Augustine, <em>Trinity</em>, 227
[VII.3.9]; cf. <em>City</em> 425 [X.24], 462 [XI.10]) One must say
&ldquo;three persons&rdquo;, but for Augustine these are not three
selves.</p>

<p>
His mammoth <em>On the Trinity</em> (Latin: <em>De Trinitate</em>) has
been endlessly mined by later theologians. In it, Augustine is
concerned to defend Pro-Nicene trinitarianism against lingering
&ldquo;Arianism&rdquo; and other heresies, confessing that this
&ldquo;is also my faith inasmuch as it is the Catholic faith&rdquo;
(70 [I.2.7]).  He argues that the Bible implicitly teaches this sort
of trinitarianism, on which the rest of the book is an extended
meditation. This meditation, he concedes, fails to yield much by way
of understanding. He holds that sin has corrupted our minds, so that
we can&rsquo;t understand the doctrine, which we should still hope to
understand in the next life (230&ndash;2 [VII.4], 430 [XV.6.45], 435
[XV.6.50]). At the end he confesses &ldquo;among all these things that
I have said about that supreme trinity&hellip; I dare not claim that
any of them is worthy of this unimaginable mystery&rdquo; (434
[XV.6.50]). Indeed, near the beginning he pictures the whole book as a
grudging concession to certain unnamed Christians, &ldquo;talkative
reason-mongers who have more conceit than capacity&rdquo;, who
conclude that their teachers don&rsquo;t know what they are talking about,
simply because those teachers are reluctant to speak of deep truths
(67 [I.1]). Augustine&rsquo;s goal is not so much to understand the Trinity
and communicate this to others, but rather to say some things that
will deliver a small shred of understanding, which may entice the
reader to pursue the experience of God (434&ndash;7
[XV.6.50&ndash;1]). Because of this dim view of what humans are equipped to
understand, much of the book is actually about how to talk about the
Trinity, rather than about the Trinity itself. We may at least confess
the correct doctrine, even if only later we come to understand what
we&rsquo;ve been saying.</p>

<p>
Despite this pronounced negative mysterian note (see
 <a href="index-2.html#NegMys">section 3.1</a> 
of the main entry), Augustine dose seem to have a rudimentary
metaphysics of the Trinity, which he uncritically receives, and does
not think can be significantly developed.</p>

<p> Augustine suggests that the standard creedal term
&ldquo;person&rdquo; (Greek: <em>hypostasis</em> or <em>prosopon</em>;
Latin: <em>persona</em>) is adopted simply so that something may be
said in answer to the question &ldquo;What is God three of?&rdquo;
(224&ndash;30 [VII.3], 241 [VIII.1.1], 398 [XV.1.5]) The term
&ldquo;person&rdquo;, he thinks, signifies a genus, but it is one for
which we can provide no species. In contrast, &ldquo;divine
essence&rdquo; names neither a genus nor a species, and functions
somewhat like a mass-term. It is supposed to be one in the items which
share it, and to make them, in some sense, numerically one (Cross
2007).</p>

<p><em>On the Trinity</em> is famous for what later authors call its
 &ldquo;psychological analogies&rdquo; of the Trinity. Augustine
 reasons that if we can&rsquo;t catch intellectual sight of the Trinity
 directly, at least we can see reflections, images, or indications of
 the Trinity in the created realm, above all in the highest part of
 human beings (the mind), who are made &ldquo;in the image and
 likeness of God&rdquo; (Augustine <em>Trinity</em>, 231 [VII.4.12];
 Genesis 1:26). In the human mind we may encounter several
 &ldquo;trinities&rdquo;, given here in the order that they somehow
 correspond to the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit:</p>

<ul>
<li>lover, loved object, the lover&rsquo;s love for that object (255 [VIII.5.13])</li>

<li>the mind, its knowledge, its love (272&ndash;5 [IX.1])</li>

<li>the mind&rsquo;s remembering itself, understanding itself, and willing
itself (298&ndash;9 [X.4])</li>

<li>memory, understanding, and will (374&ndash;82 [XIV.2&ndash;3)</li>

<li>the mind&rsquo;s remembering God, understanding God, and willing God
(383&ndash;92 [XIV.4&ndash;5])</li>

<li>existing, knowing that one exists, loving the fact that one exists
(Augustine <em>City</em>, 483&ndash;4 [XI.26];cf. <em>Confessions</em> 264&ndash;5
[XIII.11])</li>
</ul>

<p>
These are taken to be &ldquo;images&rdquo; of the Trinity, with the
final three being in some sense the most accurate. (He also discusses
a few &ldquo;trinities&rdquo; or threefold processes which he doesn&rsquo;t
hold to be images of the Trinity.) Although he apparently considers
the contemplation of these to be helpful in the pursuit of God, in the
last section (Book XV) of <em>On the Trinity</em>, Augustine emphasizes
that even these are &ldquo;immeasurably inadequate&rdquo; to represent
God (428 [XV.6.43]). The main reason is that these three are activities which a
person does or faculties a person has, whereas God &ldquo;just
is&rdquo; his memory, understanding, and will; the doctrine of divine
simplicity thus renders the mental analogies <em>at best</em>
minimally informative. Further, temporal processes seem ill-suited to
represent the nature of an essentially immutable God.</p>

<p>
Augustine holds that God is simple and thus essentially
immutable. Words which are predicated &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; of
creatures, such as good or wise, are predicated of God
essentially. Applied to us, these words signify properties we happen
to possess, and which we might have not possessed, but applied to God,
they all indicate the same thing, God&rsquo;s simple essence. What about
terms such as &ldquo;Father&rdquo; and &ldquo;Son&rdquo;? As God can&rsquo;t
have accidental features, these can&rsquo;t be predicated accidentally. But
Augustine doesn&rsquo;t want to say that they are essentially predicated
either. He suggests that they are relationally predicated, that is,
applied to God not because of his essence or accidents, but rather
because of how God is related to himself. He explores but ultimately
rejects the idea that all true predication of God is relational (Books
V-VII). He finally holds that some terms apply equally to each of the
three divine persons, whereas certain relational terms apply primarily
to one of the three. In sum,</p>

<blockquote>
This Trinity is one God: it is simple even though it is a
Trinity&hellip; because it is what it has, except insofar as one
Person is spoken of in relation to another. (Augustine <em>City</em>,
462 [XI.10])
</blockquote>

<p>
The Trinity, and also each &ldquo;person&rdquo; has as it were only
one ingredient: the divine essence which is the one God. It is
mysterious how extrinsic relations, the sole subject of which is this
simple entity, could make it contain three inter-related
&ldquo;persons&rdquo;. But Augustine thinks that no what understands
what those are anyway; the doctrine is in the end a negative
mystery. See main entry, <a href="index-2.html#Mys">section 3</a> on
mysterianism. See Thom 2012, ch 2 for a formal treatment of
Augustine&rsquo;s theory.</p>

<p>Most later trinitarinas interact in some way with Augustine&rsquo;s huge
body of work on the topic, and many consider that they are following
in his footsteps. (See sections
 <a href="#ThoAqu">4.1</a>, on Thomas Aquinas, 
 and
 <a href="#JohDunSco">4.2</a>, on John Duns Scotus,
 below, and
 <a href="index-2.html#RelIde">section 2.1</a>
 of the main text.) Augustine&rsquo;s medieval successors
 all reject three-self approaches to the Trinity (Cross 2012,
 26&ndash;7).</p>

<p>
Important medieval philosopher-theologians not discussed here who
develop Augustine&rsquo;s trinitarianism include Boethius
(ca. 480&ndash;525), Anselm of Canterbury (1033&ndash;1109) (Marenbon
2003, 66&ndash;95; Mann 2004), and Peter Abelard (1079&ndash;1142)
(Brower 2005; Marenbon 2007).</p>

<h5><a name="TheAthCre">3.3.3 The &ldquo;Athanasian&rdquo; Creed</a></h5>

<p>
The so-called Athanasian Creed (also known by the Latin words it
begins with, as the <em>Quicumque vult</em>) is a widely adopted and
beloved formulation of the doctrine. It shows strong
Augustinian influence, and is thought to be the product of an unknown
early 6th century writer. Contemporary philosophical discussions often
begin with this creed, at it puts pro-Nicene trinitarianism into a
memorably short and palpably paradoxical form.</p>

<p>
It reads, in part,</p>

<blockquote>
  Whoever wants to be saved should above all cling to the catholic
  faith. Whoever does not guard it whole and inviolable will doubtless
  perish eternally. Now this is the catholic faith: We worship one God
  in trinity and the Trinity in unity, neither confusing the persons
  nor dividing the divine being. For the Father is one person, the Son
  is another, and the Spirit is still another. But the deity of the
  Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is one, equal in glory, coeternal in
  majesty. What the Father is, the Son is, and so is the Holy Spirit.
  Uncreated&hellip; infinite&hellip; eternal&hellip; And yet there are
  not three eternal beings, but one who is eternal&hellip; Almighty is
  the Father&hellip; And yet there are not three almighty beings, but
  one who is almighty. Thus the Father is God; the Son is God; the
  Holy Spirit is God: And yet there are not three gods, but one
  God&hellip;.not three lords, but one Lord. As Christian truth
  compels us to acknowledge each distinct person as God and Lord, so
  catholic religion forbids us to say that there are three gods or
  lords. The Father was neither made nor created nor begotten; the Son
  was neither made nor created, but was alone begotten of the Father;
  the Spirit was neither made nor created, but is proceeding from the
  Father and the Son. Thus there is one Father, not three fathers; one
  Son, not three sons; one Holy Spirit, not three spirits. And in this
  Trinity, no one is before or after, greater or less than the other;
  but all three persons are in themselves, coeternal and coequal; and
  so we must worship the Trinity in unity and the one God in three
  persons. Whoever wants to be saved should think thus about the
  Trinity. (Anonymous <em>Athanasian</em>)
</blockquote>

<p>
By the latter part, it follows by the indiscernibility of identicals
that no person of the Trinity is identical with any other. And by the
earlier part, it seems to follow that there are thus at least three
eternal (etc.) things. But it asserts there&rsquo;s only one eternal
thing. Hence, the creed seems contradictory, and has been attacked as
such (Biddle 1691, i; Nye 1691a, 11; Priestley 1871, 321). Showing
where the above argument for inconsistency goes wrong is a major
motivation of recent Trinity theories (see
 <a href="index-2.html#OneSel">sections 1 and 2</a> of the main entry).
In contrast, mysterians hold that it somehow goes wrong, though no one
can say quite where.(See
 <a href="index-2.html#Mys">section 3</a> of the main entry.)  Finally,
 some simply reject the creed.</p>

<h3><a name="MedThe">4. Medieval Theories</a></h3>

<p>
Church council decisions are treated by Catholicism and Orthodoxy
much like supreme court decisions in American jurisprudence. While
early rulings may be bent and twisted to meet new needs, they are at
least in theory inviolable precedents. Thus, the structure of Christian
churches ensured that these boundaries weren&rsquo;t violated, and theorizing
about the Trinity from around 400 CE until the Reformation (ca. 1517)
was forcibly kept within the bounds of creedal orthodoxy. Thus, most
medieval trinitarian theories are essentially elaborations on the
pro-Nicene consensus in a more confident and metaphysical mode. That
is, they adhere strictly to the creedal statements as well as writings
of their tradition&rsquo;s most authoritative church fathers, but are less
reticent to give fuller accounts of what the persons are and how they
are related to one another and to God or the divine essence.</p>

<p>
There were short-lived exceptions to this conformity; periodically,
allegedly tritheistic trinitarian theologies were proposed and quickly
suppressed (Erismann 2008; Pelikan 1978, 264&ndash;7; Pohle 1919, 255&ndash;63;
Tavard 1997; see also the section on Tritheism in the entry on
 <a href="../philoponus/index.html">John Philoponus</a>).</p>


<h4><a name="ThoAqu">4.1 Thomas Aquinas</a></h4>

<p>
Thomas Aquinas sets out a highly developed and difficult trinitarian
theory (<em>Summa Contra Gentiles</em> 4.1&ndash;26, <em>Summa
Theologiae</em> I.27&ndash;43). God is &ldquo;pure act&rdquo;, that is,
he has no potentialities of any kind. God is also utterly simple, with
no distinct parts, properties, or actions. We may truly say, though,
that God understands and wills. These divine processes are reflexive
relations which are the persons of the Trinity. The Word eternally
generated by God is a <em>hypostasis</em>, what Aristotle calls a
first substance, which shares the essence of God, but which is
nonetheless &ldquo;relationally distinct&rdquo; from God. The persons
of the Trinity, as they share the divine essence, are related more
closely than things which are merely tokens of a kind (e.g.,
identical twins), but he seems to hold that none are identical to
either of the others (they are truly three). Aquinas develops
Augustine&rsquo;s idea that the &ldquo;persons&rdquo; of the Trinity are
individuated by their relations. For Aquinas, the relations Paternity,
Sonship, and Spirithood are real and distinct things in some sense
&ldquo;in&rdquo; God, which &ldquo;constitute and distinguish&rdquo;
the three persons of the Trinity (Hughes 1989, 197). The persons are
distinct <em>per relationes</em> (as to their relations) but not
distinct <em>per essentiam</em> (as to their essence or being). In the
words of one commenter,</p>

<blockquote>
  [For Aquinas,] relations both constitute and distinguish the divine
  persons: insofar as relations are the divine essence (<em>secundum
  res</em>) [i.e. they&rsquo;re the same thing], they constitute those
  persons, and insofar as they are relations with converses, they
  distinguish those persons. (Hughes 1989, 217)
</blockquote>

<p>
But how may these relations be, constitute, or somehow give rise to
<em>three</em> divine <em>hypostaseis</em> when each <em>just is</em>
the divine essence? For if each is the divine essence, won&rsquo;t it follow
that each just is (i.e. is identical to) both of the others as well?
Aquinas holds that it does <em>not</em> follow&mdash;that would amount to
modalism, not orthodox trinitarianism. To show why it doesn&rsquo;t follow,
he distinguishes between <em>identitas secundum rem et rationem</em>
(sameness of thing and of concepts) and mere <em>identitas secundum
rem</em> (sameness of thing). To the preceding objection, then, Aquinas
says that the alleged consequence would follow only if the persons were
the same both in thing and in concept. But they are not; they are
merely the same thing.</p>

<p>
This move is puzzling. Aquinas holds that the three are not merely
similar or derived from the same source, but are in <em>some</em>
strong sense the same, but <em>not</em> identical (i.e. numerically
the same) which he appears to understand as sameness in both thing and
concept. Even this last is surprising; one would think that for
Aquinas &ldquo;sameness in thing&rdquo; just is identity, and that
&ldquo;sameness in concept&rdquo; would mean that we apply the same
concept to some apparent things (whether or not they are in fact one
or many). Christopher Hughes holds that Aquinas is simply confused,
his desire for orthodoxy having led him into this (and other)
necessary falsehoods. On Hughes&rsquo;s reading, Aquinas does think of
&ldquo;sameness in thing&rdquo; as identity, but he incoherently holds
it to be non-transitive (i.e. if <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are
identical, and <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> are identical, it doesn&rsquo;t
follow that <em>A</em> and <em>C</em> are identical), while in some
contexts assuming (correctly) that it is transitive (Hughes 1989,
217&ndash;40).</p>

<p>
The interpretation of Aquinas on these points is difficult. Other
recent philosophers, more sympathetic to Aquinas&rsquo; trinitarian theory,
have not tried to salvage the entire theory, but have, with the help of
various distinctions not explicitly made by Aquinas, sought to salvage
his basic approach. This involves developing and trying to vindicate
his apparently mode-based approach to the persons (which seem to be
God&rsquo;s relating to himself in three ways), showing how these relations
may in fact be substantial persons, or specifying a relation which the
persons may each bear to the divine essence which is something short of
(classical, absolute) identity but much like it. (See
 <a href="index-2.html#OneSel">sections 1 and 2.1</a> of the main entry.)</p>

<h4><a name="JohDunSco">4.2 John Duns Scotus</a></h4>

<p>
Richard Cross argues that John Duns Scotus (1265/6&ndash;1308) has
&ldquo;one of the most compelling and powerfully coherent accounts of
the Trinity ever constructed&rdquo; (Cross 2005, 159).</p>

<p>
Realists about universals hold that in addition to individual humans,
there is a universal thing, or &ldquo;common nature&rdquo; called
&ldquo;humanity&rdquo; (Each individual human, for example Peter, is
an &ldquo;instance of&rdquo; this common nature, humanity.  Similarly,
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three
&ldquo;exemplifications&rdquo; of the &ldquo;universal&rdquo; called
&ldquo;divinity&rdquo;.) However, divinity, unlike humanity, is not
&ldquo;divided in&rdquo; its instances or exemplifications; that is,
while three instances of humanity amount to three humans, three
exemplifications of divinity don&rsquo;t amount to three divine beings.
Rather, each of the three exemplifications (Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit) is the one God. Thus, the persons are related to God somewhat
as concrete things are related to the universals of which they are
examples (Cross 1999, 61&ndash;71). Indeed, the divine nature or
essence is a universal, although it is also a substance
(a.k.a. substantial individual, subsistent thing, thing with <em>per
se</em> existence) (Cross 2005, 181). Further, though it is a
substance, it is also &ldquo;that power in virtue of which a divine
person can produce other divine persons&rdquo; (Cross 2005, 206).</p>

<p>
How are the persons related to each other? They have the divine
nature in common. They are related to each other in a way somehow
similar to two physical objects which are simultaneously made of the
same stuff or matter (this is merely an analogy&mdash;Scotus doesn&rsquo;t
believe God or any divine person to be partly composed of matter). The
persons, as it were, partially but don&rsquo;t entirely
&ldquo;overlap&rdquo;, as each is also partly composed of a unique
personal property, not had by the two others. Each person, in Scotus&rsquo;s
terms, is &ldquo;essentially identical&rdquo; with the divine essence,
but not &ldquo;formally&rdquo; or &ldquo;hypostatically&rdquo;
identical. In the same way, Peter is essentially identical with
humanity, but isn&rsquo;t formally identical with it, having his own
haecceity (his own individual essence, or &ldquo;thisness&rdquo;) not
had by any other human. But whereas Peter and Paul are &ldquo;really
distinct&rdquo;, the persons of the Trinity are not, at least if being
&ldquo;really distinct&rdquo; implies being separable (Cross 1999, 69).
Further, as Cross explicates this view, the divine nature or essence is
nothing more than &ldquo;the overlap of&rdquo; the persons, which saves
it from being some fourth divine thing in God (Cross 2005, 166).
Nonetheless, it is metaphysically &ldquo;prior to&rdquo; the persons,
in the sense of being the form in virtue of which the three relations
obtain. Moreover, this essence &ldquo;immediately determines&rdquo; the
Father, and only through him is it determined to the Son and Spirit.
This process is causal, but does not imply, Scotus holds, that the Son
and Spirit are subordinate to the Father, or that they are imperfect or
less divine than he (Cross 2005, 176&ndash;80, 245&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
The Son and Spirit are produced willingly but necessarily, the Son
being the divine Word as generated by God&rsquo;s memory, as had by the
Father. The Holy Spirit is God&rsquo;s love for his own essence. Like
Augustine, he holds that the persons are distinguished by their
relational properties, but he does this on the basis of church
tradition, not because he finds anything impossible in the supposition
that the persons are distinguished by absolute (non-relational)
properties. While the relational properties of paternity, sonship, and
being spirated constitute the three persons, he denies that those are
their only unique properties (Cross 1999, 62&ndash;7). These
properties are supposed to explain why the persons, unlike the divine
essence, are not communicable (Cross 2005, 163).</p>

<p>
Is it possible for anything to be related as Scotus thinks the members
of the Trinity are to the divine essence? As Cross asks, &ldquo;if the
divine essence is indivisible, how can it be instantiated by three
different persons?&rdquo; (Cross 1999, 68) Scotus claims that the
divine essence is &ldquo;repeatable&rdquo; or
&ldquo;communicable&rdquo; without being &ldquo;divisible&rdquo;
(Cross 1999, 68). He gives a soul-body analogy: just as the
intellective soul is equally in each organ without being
&ldquo;divided&rdquo; or composed of parts, so the divine essence
relates to the three persons. But the divine essence is the only
universal, he holds, which is commmunicable in this way.</p>

<p>
Scotus gives some perfect-being and other arguments to the effect
that there must be two and only two productions within God, and only
one unproduced producer (the Father, not the divine nature in him).
Moreover, the divine essence, being a &ldquo;quiddity&rdquo;
(exemplifiable or communicable thing) exists in or as some
non-exemplifiable thing or <em>suppositum</em>, here, the person of the
Father (Cross 2005, 127&ndash;52).</p>

<p>
This theory hasn&rsquo;t been much discussed; few Christian thinkers past or
present have claimed to understand it. Since the Reformation era, many
theologians and philosophers have been impatient with this sort of
confident metaphysical speculation, preferring to dismiss it as
learned nonsense. However, Cross has painstakingly laid out its
motivations and content. See Thom 2012, ch. 10 for formally
explication of the theory and Paasch 2012 for critical evaluation and
comparison with other medieval theories.</p>

<h3><a name="PosMedDev">5. Post-Medieval Developments</a></h3>

<p>
Starting in the great upheaval of the sixteenth century Protestant
Reformation many Christians re-examined the New Testament and rejected
many later developments as incompatible with apostolic doctrine,
lacking adequate basis in it, and often as contrary to reason as well.
Initially, many Reformation leaders de-emphasized the trinitarian
doctrine, and seemed unsure whether or not to confine it to the same
waste bin as the doctrines of papal authority and
transubstantiation (Williams 2000, 459&ndash;60). In the end, though,
those in what historians call the &ldquo;Magisterial
Reformation&rdquo; decisively fell in line on behalf of creedal
orthodoxy (roughly in line with the pro-Nicene consensus), while
other groups, now described as the &ldquo;Radical Reformation&rdquo;,
either downplayed it, ignored it, or denied it as inconsistent with
the Bible and reason. This led to several controversies between
creedal trinitarians and what came to be called
&ldquo;unitarians&rdquo; (earlier, &ldquo;Socinians&rdquo;) about
biblical interpretation, christology, and the Christian doctrine of
God, from the mid 16th to the mid 19th centuries. (See the
supplementary document
on <a href="unitarianism.html">unitarianism</a>.)</p>

<p>
As history played out, the practically non-trinitarian groups and
some of the antitrinitarian groups evolved into trinitarian ones.
Although unitarian and alternative views of the Trinity have
repeatedly re-emerged in various Christian and quasi-Christian
movements, the vast majority of Christians and Christian groups today
at least in theory adhere to the authority of the Constantinopolitan
and &ldquo;Athanasian&rdquo; creeds. At the same time, theologians have
lamented that many Christian groups are arguably functionally
non-trinitarian (though not antitrinitarian) or nearly so in their
piety and preaching.</p>

<p>
In recent theology, the Trinity has become a popular subject for
speculation, and its practical relevance for worship, marriage, gender
relations, religious experience, and politics, has been repeatedly
asserted. (See
 <a href="index-2.html#20tCenThe">section 2.2</a> of the main text.) It has fallen
 to Christian philosophers and philosophically aware theologians to
 sort out what precisely the doctrine amounts to, and to defend it
 against charges of inconsistency and unintelligibility.</p>

<p>
The doctrine&rsquo;s basis or lack of basis in the New Testament, so
vehemently debated from the 16th through the 19th centuries, is not
presently a popular topic of debate. This is probably because some
theologians hold the attempt to derive the doctrine from the Bible to
be hopelessly naive, while other theologians, many Christian
philosophers and apologists accept the common arguments
(see <a href="#NewTes">section 2.2</a> above)
as decisive. Again, the postmodern view that there are no better or
worse interpretations of texts may play a role in quenching interest
among academic theologians.  Finally, it may simply be that trust in
the mainstream tradition, or in various particular Christian
traditions, currently runs high; many confess trinitarianism simply
because their church officially does, or because it and/or the
mainstream tradition tells them that the Bible teaches it. Distrust of
councils and post-biblical religious authorities has largely
evaporated, even among Protestants from historically anti-clerical and
non-creedal groups. Ecumenical movements, and anti-sectarian
sentiments probably also play a role in deflecting attention from the
issues, in that to many it seems perverse to attack one of the few
doctrines on which all the main, dominant Christian groups are in
agreement.</p>

 This issue is covered in the separate entry on

 <a href="index-2.html#MetaFoun">section 3</a>
 on the logical form of grounding statements.</p>

 For details of Aristotle&rsquo;s view, see Corkum 2013. For a
contemporary take, see, e.g., Nolan 2011 and Paul 2013. See also the
articles in Tahko 2012 and the separate entry on
 <a href="../categories/index.html">categories</a>.
 There have been many attempts to define the category of
<em>substance</em> in terms of ontological independence. For
discussion, see Lowe 1998; Correia 2005; Schnieder 2006, and the

 The discussion regarding the formal properties of grounding has been
particularly active. Partly because of this debate, some are doubtful
that the notion of grounding (or fundamentality) can be put to good
use at all (see, e.g., Daly 2012; Wilson 2014; Koslicki 2015; Kovacs
2017; Miller &amp; Norton 2017; Lipman forthcoming). Some of these
more skeptical criticisms apply only to the notion of grounding rather
than ontological dependence relations or metaphysical determination
relations other than grounding. A different kind of deflationary
approach towards fundamentality is the view that fundamentality is
merely an expressive device, something we may use to express our
commitments about what there is (see Williams 2010; von Solodkoff
&amp; Woodward 2013). We will bring these issues up again where
relevant, but the interested reader should refer to the extensive
literature. In addition to the above, see especially the helpful table
in Bliss and Priest (2018b: sec. 2) See also Jenkins 2011; Fine 2012;
Litland 2013; Raven 2013; Tahko 2013; Rodriguez-Pereyra 2015; Barnes
2018; Bliss 2018.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 Even if naturalness on its own would not be able to capture
everything that philosophers typically wish to capture with the notion
of fundamentality, it could perhaps be supplemented with other
notions. For instance, Bricker has suggested that &ldquo;ontological
determination&rdquo;, a notion that we may associate with
fundamentality, could be analyzed in terms of supervenience and
naturalness (Bricker 2006: 255, 271) See also Plate (2016) for an
alternative account in terms of &ldquo;logically simple&rdquo;
attributes.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Not everyone would agree that all these relations are to be
understood as &ldquo;dependence&rdquo; relations, given that, e.g.,
&ldquo;realization&rdquo; is a much looser relation than some of the
others&mdash;think of
 <a href="../multiple-realizability/index.html">multiple realizability</a>
 (see Baysan 2015 for discussion on realization relations).
Regardless, we will continue to use the broad, somewhat loose sense of
&ldquo;metaphysical dependence&rdquo; in what follows.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 There is a further question about whether this existential dependence
is <em>rigid</em> or <em>generic</em>, i.e., whether one quark depends
on a specific quark or just there being some quark. The separate entry
on
 <a href="../dependence-ontological/index.html">ontological dependence</a>
 defines rigid existential dependence in terms of necessitation as
follows: <i>x</i> depends rigidly for its existence upon \(y =_{df}\)
Necessarily, <i>x</i> exists only if <i>y</i> exists.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Another potentially problematic result concerns <em>emergent</em>
entities (see the entry on
 <a href="../properties-emergent/index.html">emergent properties</a>).
 Emergent entities may be understood, for instance, as entities having
causal powers over and above their constituents&rsquo; causal powers.
More to the point, emergent entities have been traditionally
characterized as being both fundamental and dependent (e.g., by the
British Emergentists, see McLaughlin 2008). This is also a starting
point in contemporary metaphysics (Barnes 2012, Wilson 2015). Clearly,
emergent yet independent entities would directly violate (AI). So,
according to (AI), no ontologically emergent entity could be
fundamental and this is a controversial result (see also Pearson 2018
for a reply to Barnes 2012).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Sometimes the notion of fundamentality is defined explicitly in terms
of <em>explanation</em>, i.e., a fact is fundamental if and only if it
is not explained by any other fact. We might be able to translate (RI)
in such a way that it applies to this idea as well. For further
discussion on the link between fundamentality, grounding, and
explanation, see deRosset 2010, 2013; Jenkins 2013; Litland 2015;
Glazier 2016; Jansson 2016; Thompson 2016b, 2018; and Shaheen
2016.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 One of Schaffer&rsquo;s arguments in favor of priority monism takes
advantage of this, drawing on the incompatibility between the view
that mereological dependence runs from the larger to the smaller, and
the possibility of <em>gunk</em>, i.e., the view that everything has a
proper part (Schaffer 2010a: 61ff.).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 This challenge emerges for any view that holds that there is a
privileged subset of metaphysical dependence relations that are
relevant to fundamentality, such as Bennett&rsquo;s <em>building
relations</em>. These include at least the following six relations:
composition, constitution, set formation, realization, microbased
determination, and grounding. Bennett&rsquo;s approach is of special
interest here, because she attempts to address the unification
challenge (Bennett 2017: 18ff.). Her proposed answer is that since
there is at least a <em>family resemblance</em> between the various
building relations, we need an explanation for this and
Bennett&rsquo;s preferred approach is that the family of building
relations is unified via a <em>natural resemblance class</em>. This
raises some more general problems for determining what resemblance
amounts to (Bennett 2017: Ch. 3). Interested readers are also invited
to consult the entry on
 <a href="../nominalism-metaphysics/index.html">nominalism in metaphysics</a>,
 as the notion of resemblance has an important role in this discussion
(see also Benovsky 2013).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Koslicki is generally critical of grounding but argues that we should
recognize different dimensions of relative fundamentality (including
cases where <i>x</i> is less fundamental than <i>y</i> if we gain only
a partial perspective on <i>y</i> by focusing on <i>x</i>
(abstraction); <i>x</i> is &ldquo;constructed&rdquo; out of <i>y</i>,
together with other entities (construction); <i>x</i> is essentially
the result of a creative act involving an intentional agent, <i>y</i>
(artificiality); and if <i>x</i> exhibits a lower degree of unity than
<i>y</i> (disunity); see Koslicki 2015: 336&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
The possibility of variation in the formal properties of ground has
prompted many to doubt that it is strongly unified (Koslicki 2012,
2015; M. Cameron 2014; Wilson 2014). This debate is on-going.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Bennett (2017: Ch. 2.4) resists what she calls &ldquo;generalist
monism&rdquo; about building&mdash;a view equivalent to a strongly
unified conception of grounding, which takes it to be a singular and
univocal notion (Tahko 2015: 118ff.). See also Bertrand 2017 for a
defense of building &ldquo;singularism&rdquo; and Berker forthcoming
for a defense of a unified notion of ground.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 One further understanding of fundamentality that could be linked to
(RI-one) is the idea that the notion of <em>truthmaking</em> could be
definitive of fundamentality (see the separate entry on
 <a href="../truthmakers/index.html">truthmakers</a>,
 and for the connection to fundamentality, see Sider 2011: Chs. 8.4,
8.5; Fisher 2016). As Sider (2011: 157) puts it, &ldquo;The only
fundamental facts, on this view, are certain singular existential
facts, facts of the form &ldquo;<i>x</i> exists&rdquo;, where <i>x</i>
is a truthmaker&rdquo;. The nonfundamental truths would then be made
true by these truthmakers. Sider himself abandons this alternative
partly because it violates <em>purity</em>, the principle according to
which fundamental truths involve only fundamental notions (but see
Fisher 2016 for a defense of the view). One might also attempt to
develop on this idea by invoking the notion of a <em>minimal
truthmaker</em>, familiar from Armstrong: &ldquo;If <i>T</i> is a
minimal truthmaker for <i>p</i>, then you cannot subtract anything
from <i>T</i> and the remainder still be a truthmaker for
<i>p</i>&rdquo; (Armstrong 2004: 19&ndash;20). Giving a complete list
of such minimal truthmakers could be understood as one way of
describing the fundamental base (on minimal truthmakers, see Schaffer
2010b; Fisher 2015; O&rsquo;Conaill &amp; Tahko 2016; Tahko 2018; see
also Williams 2010).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 We could also define (CMB) negatively in such a way that the
fundamental entities are those that are not determined by anything
else. However, this would effectively collapse (CMB) to another
version of (RI) since not being determined by anything else is to be
<em>determination-independent</em>, for want of a better term.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 Accordingly, the sense in which the basis is <em>complete</em> is not
sufficiently captured in terms of <em>modal completeness</em>, the
idea that the complete set of the fundamental entities
(metaphysically) necessitates everything else and hence everything
else existentially depends on the fundamental entities. We saw already
in
 <a href="index-2.html#AbsoInde">section 1.1</a>
 that modal dependence appears to be too coarse-grained to capture the
sense of fundamentality that we are after. Bennett (2017:
108&ndash;109) puts forward some further reasons to rule out modal
completeness.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 The complete set is of course a singular entity, but this is simply a
convenient way to refer to the plurality captured by the complete set.
Moreover, on a monistic view, the commitment to a plural underpinning
would have to be dropped, but by using the idea of a complete minimal
set, it is straightforward to interpret (CMB) in such a way that
monism may be accommodated as well.</p>

<p>
In the context of grounding, Dasgupta (2014b) has entertained the idea
that ground is irreducibly plural. Recent work on the logic of
&ldquo;many-many&rdquo; grounding develops this idea (Litland 2016a).
The terminology here is still developing though, as Litland (2018) now
recommends the notion of <em>bicollectiveness</em> whereby grounding
is bicollective if it is <em>left-collective</em> (several truths
collectively ground one truth) and <em>right-collective</em> (one
truth grounds some plurality of truths taken together but not any
individual truth in that plurality). The central idea here is that
what is grounded could (irreducibly) be a collection of truths. This
contrasts with the usual understanding of grounding being many-one or
one-one.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Some of the discussion on the notion of a <em>minimal supervenience
base</em> is closely related (Sider 1996: 21; Eddon 2013). Sider (2011:
259&ndash;260) discusses a similar condition which he labels
&ldquo;nonredundancy&rdquo;. Relevant examples include relations and
their converses, such as &ldquo;earlier&rdquo; and
&ldquo;later&rdquo;, as well as the fact that several subsets of the
logical operators are functionally complete (e.g., conjunction and
negation, or the Sheffer stroke). One thing we must weigh in these
cases is the potential theoretical cost of insisting on uniqueness.
Sider seems to think that redundancy may be acceptable in such
cases.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 Some of these issues are helpfully discussed by Bennett, who compares
the merits of (her versions) of (CMB) and (RI), ultimately siding with
(RI) (Bennett 2017: Chs. 5.4, 5.6).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Note that this line of argument does go against the view that
Schaffer (2010b; see also R. Cameron 2008) himself has defended,
namely, that there must be a &ldquo;ground of being&rdquo; and hence a
fundamental level is needed to get the priority ordering started. We
will return to this issue when discussing metaphysical foundationalism
and metaphysical infinitism in sections
 <a href="index-2.html#MetaFoun">3</a>
 and
 <a href="index-2.html#MetaInfi">4</a>.</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 The set-theoretic sense is also what Raven (2016: 614) appears to
have in mind, although he remains neutral about the well-foundedness
of ground, whereas Bennett (2017: Ch. 5.5) is explicitly neutral about
the well-foundedness of her notion of building.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 The situation is somewhat unfortunate, because philosophers have used
the notion &ldquo;well-foundedness&rdquo; in slightly different
senses. Rabin &amp; Rabern (2016: 369) suspect that it may be too late
to change terminology at this point. Instead, they hope that by
clarifying the different senses of well-foundedness available we can
avoid further confusion. Accordingly, both Dixon and Rabin &amp;
Rabern go on to suggest that there is a distinct, ground-theoretic
sense of well-foundedness that may capture the foundationalist
intuition that many (or at least some) people have had in mind. Bohn
(2018: 168) calls this <em>metaphysical well-foundedness</em>. This
notion of metaphysical well-foundedness is more fine-grained and
weaker than the standard set-theoretic sense. However, it would be
best to retain the standard, set-theoretic sense of
&ldquo;well-foundedness&rdquo; and we will do so in this entry. To
capture the weaker constraint, we use the notion of <em>metaphysical
foundation</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 The examples of such metaphysically well-founded yet infinite and
unbounded chains discussed by Dixon and Rabin &amp; Rabern (see also
Bliss 2013) are quite abstract and require some assumptions that are
not entirely uncontroversial. For instance, they rely on a very
fine-grained conception of facts, infinitary disjunctions, and the
overdetermination of grounds (but see Litland 2016b for an attempt at
constructing a less controversial example).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>
 For another attempt, see Trogdon (2018b), who examines the idea that
grounded entities &ldquo;inherit&rdquo; their reality from their
grounds (originating in Schaffer 2016b). Raven (2016: 608) puts
forward a trilemma whereby (i) necessarily, something is fundamental
and (ii) a strong sense of well-foundedness (akin to the set-theoretic
sense) is associated with the notion of &ldquo;foundational&rdquo;, so
something is fundamental only if it is well-founded in the strong,
set-theoretic sense. Further, Raven thinks that it&rsquo;s possible
that (iii) nothing is foundational in this strong sense (a view he
calls &ldquo;abyssalism&rdquo;). So, metaphysical foundationalism
defined in terms of Raven&rsquo;s &ldquo;foundationalism&rdquo; seems
to lead us to a contradiction. Raven doesn&rsquo;t want to give up
metaphysical foundationalism, so he rejects the idea that
foundationalism needs to be defined in terms of the strong sense of
well-foundedness and attempts to define a version of metaphysical
foundationalism compatible with abyssalism.</p>

 There is an important connection between this idea and one that we
encountered earlier in
 <a href="index-2.html#Prim">section 1.4</a>.
 The earlier idea came up in relation to Wilson (2016: 196ff.), who
attempts to find a way to fix the order of priority in the (seeming)
absence of a fundamental level. Wilson considers the possibility of
something acting as the fundamental level (in terms of convergence to
a limit, cf. Wilson 2016: 197; Montero 2006: 179; Morganti 2015: 562). This is
in fact very close to Raven&rsquo;s idea of persistence, which Raven
(2016: 613fn6) also associates with Tahko&rsquo;s (2014) discussion of
boring infinite descent, where the same structure repeats infinitely
(cf. Schaffer 2003: 505, 510; see also Brown &amp; Ladyman 2009:
30&ndash;31).</p>

 For instance, Heil (2012: 38 ff.) suggests that ruling out infinite
complexity is a necessary constraint for scientific theorizing; this
leads him to deny actual infinities altogether (see also Schrenk
2009).</p>

 Morganti&rsquo;s (2014, 2015) and Wilson&rsquo;s (2016) discussion of
the idea of convergence to a limit, which we encountered in
 <a href="index-2.html#Prim">section 1.4</a>,
 may be relevant here. The difficulty with this idea is to come up
with a more concrete example than a sequence of numbers such as 1/2,
1/3, 1/4 &hellip; approaching (but never reaching) zero at the limit
(Wilson 2016: 197 considers the possibility of a &ldquo;thermodynamic
limit&rdquo;). Whether the idea of convergence to a limit satisfies
(MF) is also debatable. Is it plausible that the regulative role of
the limit in this type of scenario is enough to satisfy the intuitive
sense of having a foundation that we have tried to capture in previous
sections? We will leave this issue open for future research.</p>

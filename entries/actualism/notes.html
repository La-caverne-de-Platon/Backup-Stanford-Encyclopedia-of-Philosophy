<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Actualism</a></h2>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>  
 There is no uniformity in the literature on the use of
&lsquo;existence&rsquo; and its cognates as it relates to the distinction
between being and actuality.  Unlike &lsquo;being&rsquo;, which is pretty
much universally taken to indicate the broadest ontological category
encompassing absolutely everything there is in any sense,
&lsquo;existence&rsquo; is sometimes used to indicate being and other
times actuality.  In this article I will follow the terminology initially
fixed by Russell [1903] (&sect;427) and will contrast being with existence
and, hence, I will take &lsquo;existence&rsquo;, &lsquo;actual
existence&rsquo;, and &lsquo;actuality&rsquo; (and their cognates), within
any metaphysical context, all to indicate the same property.
Stylistically, I will typically contrast existence with being and
actuality with possibility.  For emphasis only, I will sometimes use the
(redundant) expressions &lsquo;actually exists&rsquo;, &lsquo;actually
existing&rsquo;, and &lsquo;actual existence&rsquo;.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a> &ldquo;Tarskian
semantics&rdquo; is a bit of a misnomer.  Tarski's work was
certainly the genesis of the modern day semantics for first-order logic,
but its current form &mdash; due, largely, to Kemeny [1956a/b] &mdash; is
quite different from what one actually finds in Tarski's writings,
particularly in the centrality in modern semantics of the mathematical
notion of an <em>interpretation</em> of an otherwise completely
uninterpreted formal language.  See Tarski [1936] (translated as
&ldquo;The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages&rdquo; in Tarski
[1956]) as well as the entry on
 <a href="../tarski-truth/index.html">Tarski's Truth Definitions</a>.</p>
 
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>  We assume here that, as with
all natural kinds, being an Alien is an essential property of anything
that has it.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>  A potential actualist move is
worth addressing here. One might argue that, in fact, there is a
straightforward actualist account of the possibility of Aliens. A
widely-accepted contemporary metaphysical belief is that, for every set of
objects, there exists the mereological sum consisting of exactly those
objects. Given this, assuming that Aliens are composed of the same basic
atomic stuff that we are, there are surely actual merological sums of
atoms that are possible Aliens, i.e., that
<em>could</em> have been Aliens if only they'd been properly arranged.
Hence, there is no need to postulate possibilia to provide a semantics
for claims like &lsquo;It is possible that there are Aliens&rsquo;.
However, this objection misses the point. The general intuition that we
are attempting to isolate with the Alien example is that</p>

<blockquote>(*) <em>There could have been things other than the things
that actually exist</em>.</blockquote>

<p>

All that the actualist move just noted succeeds in showing is that
perhaps the Alien example doesn't entail (*). But it does not succeed
in accounting for the intuition that (*) is true. For suppose we accept
the proposed mereological gambit, i.e., that certain mereological sums
of actual atoms could have been Aliens, or instances of any other
uninstantiated natural kind. Is it not still the case that there could
have been <em>different atoms</em> (or quarks or whatever basic
building blocks you choose) than there are in fact? Indeed, is it not
logically possible that the universe could have been composed of
entirely different stuff altogether? If so, then the actualist still
needs to account for (*).</p>

<p>

It should also be noted that the mereological gambit itself is
dubious. Its basic premise &mdash; that any collection of atoms constitutes a
further physical object &mdash; is far from uncontroversial.  More seriously,
it seems quite clear that no instance of a physical natural
kind <em>is</em> identical with any given mereological sum of atoms, as
physical bodies are constituted by many different sums of atoms across
time as those bodies change.  Moreover, the view, as Williamson [2000]
(p. 202) notes, implies an &ldquo;implausibly reductive&rdquo; view of the
metaphysics of physical objects.  Notably, mereological sums, for example
survive scattering, whereas the objects they constitute typically do
not.</p>

<p>

Perhaps, however, the actualist could come up with some more sophisticated
mereological construct C to avoid this objection. Still, it seems, there
are problems.  Again, intuitively, it seems that one and the same
construct C, structured one way, could have been an instance of one kind,
and structured another, could have been an instance of a different
kind. But then it seems to follow from the &ldquo;modal
transitivity&rdquo; of identity (i.e., the principle:
&forall;<em>x</em>&#9633;&forall;<em>y</em>(<em>y</em>=<em>x</em> &rarr;
&#9633;&forall;<em>z</em>(<em>x</em>=<em>z</em> &rarr;
<em>y</em>=<em>z</em>))) that if a member of a natural kind is literally
identical with a C, then it is possible that an instance of a given kind
could have been an instance of a very different kind. But this conflicts
with strong intuitions about the essentiality of kind membership. So even
if the actualist's hypothetical construct C were plausible, rather
than taking Cs to be actualist surrogates for possible Aliens (or
whatever), it would be at least equally reasonable to claim that certain
Cs are only possibly <em>co-located</em> with, or
possibly <em>constitutive of</em>, but not possibly identical with, an
Alien. For, in that case, all that follows is that the same C might have
been co-located with (or constitutive of) instances of very different
natural kinds, and intuitions about the essentiality of kind membership
are preserved.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>  Note that NE and NNE are
not strictly entailed by possibilism, taken as the thesis that there are
things that do not exist, but which could have existed.  For there seems
to be nothing inconsistent in the idea of a thing that contingently fails
to exist and also only contingently <em>is</em>.  But the idea is odd.
For what contingent facts could have made it the case that, for a
given <em>possibile</em> <i>a</i>, instead of simply failing to exist,
there was no such thing as <i>a</i> at all?  Many things can intuitively
account for a possible object failing to exist, e.g., the failure of two
persons to meet who might otherwise have had children together.  But what
relevant, substantive difference distinguishes worlds in which <i>a</i>
fails to exist from those in which <i>a</i> fails to be altogether?  No
substantive answer is forthcoming; it would have to be taken as an
inexplicable brute fact.  For the possibilist, therefore,
mere <em>possibilia</em> are most naturally taken to be necessary
beings.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a> There is controversy in the
literature over whether actualism entails serious actualism.  Fine [1985]
(pp. 163ff) and Pollock [1985] (pp. 126f) both argue that the latter does
not follow from the former.  Plantinga himself argued in [1979] (Section
III) that it does, although he later recanted in [1983], where he points
out the &ldquo;flocculent thinking&rdquo; (p. 12) of his earlier argument.
He was not, however, persuaded by the arguments of Fine and Pollock
against the entailment, which he also considered unsound and, indeed, in
[1985] (pp. 321-325), he reverted to his original position, arguing
that actualism does indeed entail serious actualism after all.  Michael
Bergmann [1996] proffered a new argument for the entailment, which led to
the exchange Hudson [1997] and Bergmann [1999].  See also Yagisawa [2005]
for an argument against serious actualism and the reply by Stephanou
[2007].</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>
Unfortunately, for reasons rooted ultimately in the monumental work of
G&ouml;del [1931], a first-order logic cannot provide a completely
<em>decidable</em> mechanism for determining validity. More exactly,
while it is true that, if a formula is valid, one can eventually find a
proof of it in the logic, there is in general no proof theoretic way to
determine that a formula is <em>invalid</em>.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a> In the one case, then,
a trace, or vestige, of something <i>x</i> is identical to <i>x</i>
while in the other it is not.  Not that anything hangs on the matter,
as the usage here is a stipulation, but the ordinary meaning of
&lsquo;trace&rsquo; arguably supports both. On the one hand, a trace
of something can be that very thing, albeit in an attenuated state
&mdash; one might say that the embers of a once roaring blaze are but
a trace of the fire, but they arguably constitute that very fire in a
late stage of its existence.  On the other hand, a trace of something
may be no more than a sign of that object.  Thus, a criminal who
leaves some of his DNA behind at a crime scene is said to have left a
trace of himself but, while (twins excepted) the trace is associated
uniquely with the perpetrator, it is obviously distinct from him or
her.</p>

<p>
   <a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>  A term (i.e., a
   variable or individual constant) &tau; is <em>substitutable for</em> a
   variable &alpha; in a formula &phi; just in case &tau; is an individual
   constant or no free of occurrence of &alpha; in &phi; is in the scope
   of a quantifier occurrence of the
   form <sup>&lceil;</sup>&forall;&tau;<sup>&rceil;</sup> or
   <sup>&lceil;</sup>&exist;&tau;<sup>&rceil;</sup>.)</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>  McMichael does not actually
 use the idea of inclusion relative to an argument place.  Rather, I have
 introduced it to simplify the presentation of the theory. It is an
 equivalent mechanism and so has no impact on the theory's
 content. McMichael's own account relies on an elegant, but conceptually
 more challenging permutation mechanism that shuffles argument places in
 relations.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>  For the sake of
 simplicity, we ignore temporal qualifications in these examples that
 would be needed in a fully accurate account, e.g., [<i>being condemned to
 death as an adult</i>].</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>
 As indicated, order matters in our representation of relations: the
 binary role that Boswell bears to Johnson is distinct from the binary
 role that Johnson bears to Boswell, the latter, of course, being the
 converse of the former.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>  More exactly, given
McMichael's revised understanding of <em>de re</em> possibility, it means
that it is possible that <i>R</i><sub>1</sub> be exemplified without any
role accessible to <i>b</i>'s role @(<i>b</i>) being exemplified.)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>
 Things are a bit
more subtle than this, for to have an intended* model, one also needs
to do a little more to reflect the modal facts expressed by means of
iterated modalities. See Menzel (1990) for details. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a> Following Adams,
Nelson (2009) also argues that S4 and S5 are invalid on strict
actualist grounds.  In private correspondence with the author of this
entry, Nelson reported that has come to repudiate this position, for
reasons of the sort discussed in Turner 2005, &sect;6.</p>


<h3>Notes to the Supplement: Classical Possibilism and Lewisian Possibilism</h3>

<p>

<a href="possibilism.html#note-1" name="LP1">1.</a> 
 Cf. Sextus Empiricus [1949]
(10.218, SVF 2.331): &ldquo;The Stoics want to place above this [the
existent] yet another, more primary genus&hellip;. Some Stoics consider
&lsquo;something&rsquo; the first genus, and I shall add the reason why
they do. In nature, they say, some things exist, some do not exist. But
nature includes even those which do not exist &mdash; things which enter
the mind, such as Centaurs, giants, and whatever else falsely formed by
thought takes on some image despite lacking substance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

<a href="possibilism.html#note-2" name="LP2">2.</a> 
 To quote Prior further,
according to the doctrine of <em>ampliatio</em>,</p>

<blockquote>
  &hellip;what things a general term can stand for depends in part on the tense
  or mood of the verb with which it is used.  In &lsquo;Some man is
  running&rsquo;, the word &lsquo;man&rsquo; can stand for any man now
  existing; but in &lsquo;Some man will be running&rsquo; it can stand
  also for a man who merely will exist, and in &lsquo;Some man could be
  running&rsquo; it can stand for a man who merely could exist&hellip;.
</blockquote>

<p>

<a href="possibilism.html#note-3" name="LP3">3.</a>  For instance, in the
Preface of [1903] (p. xvii) he writes: &ldquo;In pure mathematics, actual
objects in the world of existence will never be in question&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
  
<a href="possibilism.html#note-4" name="LP4">4.</a>  In
Russell [1903], &sect;430, for example, he writes that &ldquo;there
seems to be no true proposition of which there is any sense in which
it might be said to be false&hellip;. What is true is true; what is false is
false; and concerning fundamentals there is nothing more to be
said.&rdquo; See also Russell [1904], 208-9.</p>

<p>

<a href="possibilism.html#note-5" name="LP5">5.</a>  Indeed, van Inwagen [2008]
(pp. 40-41) denies outright that Lewis is a possibilist in any sense.</p>

<h3>Notes to the Supplement: The Simplest Quantified Modal Logic</h3>

<p>
   <a href="SQML.html#note-1" name="SQML-1">1.</a>  A term (i.e., a
   variable or individual constant) &tau; is <em>substitutable for</em> a
   variable &alpha; in a formula &phi; just in case &tau; is an individual
   constant or no free of occurrence of &alpha; in &phi; is in the scope
   of a quantifier occurrence of the form &forall;&tau; or
   &exist;&tau;.)</p>

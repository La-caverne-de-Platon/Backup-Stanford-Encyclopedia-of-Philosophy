<h3><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
Descartes starts his <em>Passions of the Soul</em> (1649) by lamenting
the sorry state of ancient writings on the passions, and declaring
that &ldquo;I shall be obliged to write just as if I were considering
a topic that no one had dealt with before me&rdquo; (AT XI 328, CSM I
328). It is true that he rejects aspects of Aquinas&rsquo;s views and
explicitly tasks those cruel philosophers who &ldquo;require their
sage to be insensible&rdquo; (whom he identifies as the
&ldquo;Cynics,&rdquo; then considered to represent a particularly
austere form of Stoicism). But he also adopts many features of
previous accounts. For instance, he uses the Stoic and Galenist notion
of animal spirits (tailored to his own mechanistic physics), cites
Vives on the physiology of laughter (AT XI 422, CSM I 372), and shows
numerous, if rarely acknowledged, debts to Montaigne, Lipsius, and
Suarez. Perhaps most notably, he adopts &ldquo;passion&rdquo; as his
preferred vocabulary, contrasting it with action in a way that harks
back to Aristotle.</p>

<h3><a name="ProTheFunPas">2. The Project of Theodicy and the Function of the Passions</a></h3>

<p>
Much of the context for Descartes&rsquo;s approach to the passions lies
in his <em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em> (1641) (see also the
corresponding sections of the 1644 <em>Principles of Philosophy</em>).
As part of a general defense of God&rsquo;s goodness in the face of
seeming shortcomings in our nature, the Sixth Meditation seeks to
justify the way in which we are equipped to respond to the outside
world by experiencing sensations, appetites, and passions. Descartes
has already argued that these confused, bodily-based perceptions are
the source of much theoretical error, since they tempt us to attribute
properties of our sensation to the extended world. Such errors,
however, are not merely careless slips; sensations, appetities, and
passions are so intrinsically confused that they provide material for
error. They are thus &lsquo;materially false&rsquo; perceptions. The
hazards they present for theoretical knowledge, however, are merely
the flip side to their practical functionality: sensations, appetites,
and passions provide guides for maneuvering our bodies through the
world, and ultimately for preserving the mind-body union that
constitutes the human being. But practical efficiency comes at the
cost of some fallibility. Under non-standard conditions (e.g., when we
suffer from illness, or body parts go missing), our signposts may lead
us astray. This is because they are generated by purely mechanical
laws, according to a machine design that under normal circumstances
allows them to serve certain ends, as is the case with a well-built
watch. Thus, bodily-based perceptions are explained
<em>functionally</em>: they are justified by way of their purposes,
but how they serve those ends requires resort to strictly mechanical
causation. The functional character, as well as the confusion, of
these perceptions seems founded on their mixed ontological status:
they are modes, yet &ldquo;must not be referred either to the mind
alone or to the body alone&rdquo; (<em>Principles</em>, AT VIII 23,
CSM I 209; for a range of interpretations, see Hoffman 1990, Brown
2006, Schickel 2011, and further below). Although the
<em>Meditations</em> concentrates on our disposition to experience
sense qualia, which normally mark qualities and differences between
qualities of external things in relation to us, Descartes&rsquo;s
defense may work better for the appetites and passions. For these
perceptions seem to have a built-in evaluative component that is
directly related to their purposiveness (see Schmitter 2007). Later
works address this feature of the passions explicitly.</p>

<h3><a name="PasMedFre">3. Passions, Medicine and Freedom</a></h3>

<p>
The relation between the emotions and health is the topic of the
correspondence between Descartes and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia in
1643 and 1645. Starting with a letter of 6 May 1643 (AT III 660,
Shapiro 2007 61&ndash;2), Elisabeth queries Descartes on how such
metaphysically disparate things as mind and body can act on each
other, to which Descartes responds by emphasizing that the mind and
body form a genuine union. But by 1645, their discussion shifts to
whether the mind can control the body, particularly its passions.
Descartes diagnoses a &ldquo;low grade fever&rdquo; from which
Elisabeth has been suffering as caused by sadness or melancholy, and
recommends the familiarly Stoic-sounding remedy of reading Seneca,
while reflecting on her mind and its ability to master bodily-based
passions. Elisabeth takes exception to this suggestion, remarking that
her &ldquo;body imbued with a large part of the weaknesses of my sex
&hellip; is afflicted very easily by the afflictions of the
soul&rdquo; (Elisabeth to Descartes, 24 May 1645, AT IV 208, Shapiro
2007 88). Despite the reference to her particular weakness, her point
is general: there are certain <em>bodily</em> conditions &ndash;
illness, weakness, stress, or just a &ldquo;touch of the vapors&rdquo;
&ndash; that interfere with the mental activities of reasoning and
willing, make us more prone to the passions, and thereby compromise
our ability to apply the cure Descartes has recommended. Elisabeth
here raises an important issue for the kind of neo-Stoic view
Descartes advances in their correspondence: even if some people manage
resolutely to overcome the passions and achieve happiness, is it
possible to do so &ldquo;without the assistance of that which does not
depend absolutely on the will&rdquo;? (Elisabeth to Descartes, 16
August 1645, AT IV 269, Shapiro 2007 100.) This question haunts many
other early modern treatments of the emotions, and Spinoza in
particular, adopts views that seem very close to Elisabeth&rsquo;s
concerns.</p>

<h3><a name="Part4">4. The Passions and the Nature of Mind-Body Union</a></h3>

<p>
As the correspondence with Elisabeth shows, the topic of the passions
tends to arise in close proximity to that of mind-body union. Indeed,
the Sixth Meditation explicitly introduces the union in order to
explain the material falsity characteristic of our sense-perception,
appetites and passions, while emphasizing that they manifest our
embodiment: through them, nature teaches that &ldquo;I am not merely
present in my body as a sailor is present in a ship, but that I am
very closely joined and, as it were intermingled with it, so that I
and the body form a unit&rdquo; (AT VII 81; CSM II 56). Later, the
exchange with Elisabeth about interaction and the conduct of our
embodied lives prompts Descartes to make his first attempt at a
general characterization of the passions of the soul (see Descartes to
Elisabeth, 6 October 1645, AT IV 310-11, Shapiro 2007 118-9).For these
reasons, some commentators have looked to the passions to help explain
how the union of mind and body is constituted.</p>

<p>
But it is by no means clear what Descartes means by mind-body union,
and in particular, what sort of metaphysical status the union has.
When Princess Elisabeth quizzes him to explain the mechanics of
interaction, Descartes replies by insisting that our understanding of
interaction depends on the notion of union, which he identifies as one
of the three &ldquo;primitive notions,&rdquo; along with that of the
mind and that of the body, enabling all our knowledge (Descartes to
Elisabeth, 21 May 1643, AT III 665, Shapiro 2007 65). In his rather
exasperated correspondence with Regius, Descartes maintains in no
uncertain terms that mind and body form an <i>ens per se</i>, that is,
a genuine entity in itself, rather than a merely accidental
conglomeration such as the <i>per accidens</i> entity formed out of
conjoining me with the tree on which I lean (Descartes to Regius,
December 1641, AT III 460, CSMK 200). This echoes the Fourth Replies
where he calls mind and body a &ldquo;unity in its own right&rdquo;
[<i>unum per se</i>] (AT VII 222, CSM II 157). In the replies and many
other places, Descartes declares that mind and body form a
&ldquo;substantial union&rdquo; [<i>unio . . . substantialis</i>],
although at the same time he contends we have &ldquo;a clear and
distinct concept of the mind on its own as a complete thing&rdquo; (AT
VII 228, CSM II 160). So, the mind-body union is a unity in the sense
that it is an individuable entity with some kind of determinate
nature. Does that mean that it counts as a substance &ndash; a third
kind of substance &ndash; albeit a composite one?</p>

<p>
Paul Hoffman thinks that it does, and that &lsquo;substance,&rsquo;
&lsquo;<i>ens per se</i>,&rsquo; and &lsquo;complete thing&rsquo; are
equivalent terms for Descartes (1986, 346, reprinted in 2009, 18; see
also Broughton and Mattern 1978, 27). Taking a cue from
Descartes&rsquo;s description of the soul as the &ldquo;substantial
form&rdquo; of the human body, he considers the full, embodied human
being to be a hylomorphic unity, a substance in an Aristotelian sense.
Since Descartes admits only the mind as a &ldquo;true substantial
form&rdquo; (Descartes to Regius, January 1642, AT III 505, CSMK 208),
the hylomorphic structure does not apply to substances other than
human beings. But that union does give the embodied human a specific
nature. And so, admitting this third kind of substance makes room to
attribute specific modes to it, modes that would otherwise be tricky
to locate, since they seem to modify both mind and body. They are
modes of union, or as Hoffman dubs them, &ldquo;straddling
modes&rdquo; (Hoffman, 1990, reprinted in 2009). The passions are just
such straddling modes; they can only be understood as modifications of
a being that is both bodily and mental. Hoffman can thereby &nbsp;make
sense of important passages in the <i>Passions of the Soul</i>, where
Descartes declares that &ldquo;what is a passion in the soul is
usually an action in the body&rdquo; and identifies them as the
&ldquo;same thing&rdquo; (AT XI 328, CSM I 328).</p>

<p>
By elevating the metaphysical status of embodied humans, Hoffman has a
counter to those commentators who maintain that Descartes&rsquo;s talk
of union is nothing more than an obfuscating way of talking about
causal interaction (see Wilson 1978, p. 205). But taking the union as
a third kind of substance comes with its own costs. In positing the
real distinction between mind and body, Descartes cites their very
different essences, which give them incompatible, even contradictory
features (e.g., indivisible and divisible; see AT VII 85&ndash;6, CSM
II 59). A composite substance with both natures would seem just the
sort of ontological mess that Descartes objects to in scholastic
metaphysics (see <i>Comments on a Certain Broadsheet</i>, AT VIIIB
348&ndash;9, CSM I 297&ndash;8). The <i>Principles of Philosophy
</i>puts the demands of Descartes&rsquo;s basic ontology bluntly:
&ldquo;to each substance there belongs one principal attribute.&rdquo;
Descartes there admits an equivocation in calling mind and body
&lsquo;substances&rsquo; along with the infinite God, but says nothing
about even the possibility of any composite substances (AT VIIIA
24&ndash;25, CSM I 210&ndash;11; see also Alanen 2003, 62). Moreover,
although the <i>Passions of the Soul</i> does identify the passions
with bodily actions, it does so in the context of enjoining us to
examine &ldquo;the difference between the soul and the body,&rdquo; to
distinguish what belongs to each as a basic methodological principle
(AT XI 328, CSM I 328). There is an explanatory difference between
operations of the mind and operations of the body that must be
recognized and respected when addressing the passions: there is no
separate and irreducible science of the embodied human being.</p>

<p>
Perhaps there is some middle ground between Hoffman&rsquo;s trialist
account and a thoroughly deflationary approach to the union. Recently,
Deborah Brown and Calvin Normore have argued, for reasons both
philosophic and historical, that the &ldquo;substantial union&rdquo;
is not itself a substance. Drawing from the history of the term
<i>unio substantialis</i> and from other places where Descartes talks
about mereological wholes that are not substances, they argue that
Descartes has the tools to treat the mind-body union as having its own
genuine nature, without committing to a trialism of substance (see
2019, Chapter 6, especially pp. 187-200). As such, it can serve as the
subject for &ldquo;unique sensory and affective predicates&rdquo;
(2019, 173). This seems a plausible way to fit ordinary, middle-sized
objects into Descartes&rsquo;s ontology. Still, Descartes himself
remains pretty quiet about any general strategy for individuating
unities other than his stripped-down ontology of substances,
attributes and modes. This is in marked contrast to, e.g., Spinoza,
who discusses what it is to be a &ldquo;singular thing&rdquo; at
length (see <i>Ethics</i> IID7, IIIP6-7, and IVA1). So, there seems
some reason for the metaphysical status of mind-body union to remain
vexed. </p>

<p>
However we understand the ontology, what does seem clear is that the
experience of the passions, as well as other bodily-based perceptions
such as sense-perceptions, provides a <i>phenomenology </i>of union:
our sense-perceptions, appetites and passions enable us to experience
ourselves as embodied humans, spatially located relative to extended,
sensible objects and interacting with them. This is what Deborah Brown
describes as &ldquo;phenomenological monism &ndash; an experience of
being one unified and embodied substance&rdquo; (2006, 3). This is not
&lsquo;experience&rsquo; as later empiricists would understand it, but
the rich, value-laden experience afforded through sense-perceptions
<i>and</i> passions, experience of &ldquo; those things which pertain
to the union of the soul and the body.&rdquo; Such things are
&ldquo;known very clearly by the senses,&rdquo; but only
&ldquo;obscurely by the understanding alone, or even by the
understanding aided by the imagination&rdquo; (Descartes to Elisabeth,
28 October 1643, AT III 691-2, Shapiro 2007 69). The experience,
Descartes emphasizes, is pre-reflective experience, vivid, but
confused, and irreducible to those distinct ideas that have been
distilled through and refined for the understanding (see Alanen 2008).
As such, we should not expect to be able to explain the experience
away through a process of clarifying and distinguishing its
components. The notion of the union is primitive for the experience of
the passions and other body-based perceptions, and also required for
their defense. Here, again, the passions seem a particularly exemplary
kind of the rich, clear, yet not fully distinct experience Descartes
has in mind. The passions present their objects in relation to the
embodied human, e.g., something is good for me-qua-embodied, or poses
a risk for me-qua-embodied. Embodiment itself also may become the
object of a passionate love and care when, say, bodily health elicits
love and joy in the soul. Indeed the passions and their intellectual
counterparts may help explain how we come to identify with the union:
Descartes speculates about how the soul when it &ldquo;began to be
joined to our body&rdquo; perceives the body&rsquo;s proper
development, loves it, and thus joins itself willingly to the body, so
as to make a more perfect union (AT XI 407-8, CSM I 365-6; see also
Rorty 1986, Alanen 2003, 197).</p>

<h3><a name="DefPasSou">5. The Definition of the <em>Passions of the Soul</em></a></h3>

<p>
The correspondence with Elisabeth prodded Descartes to produce his
most important text on the emotions, the <em>Passions of the
Soul</em>, in response to her demand to &ldquo;define the passions, in
order to know them better&rdquo; (Elisabeth to Descartes, 13 September
1645, AT IV 289, Shapiro 2007 110). The <em>Passions of the Soul</em>
may not be a completely satisfactory explanation of mind-body union,
but it does provide the definition Elisabeth asked for, as well as an
intricate taxonomy of the passions, a description of their bodily
causes, effects and function, and an account of the pursuit of virtue
that addresses the means and extent to which we can regulate the
passions.</p>

<p>
Descartes&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;passion&rdquo; works by honing in
on stricter and stricter senses of the term. In the first place,
passions are simply those &ldquo;functions&rdquo; of the soul that are
not actions: namely, perceptions. But since actions, such as
volitions, can themselves be perceived, Descartes prefers to restrict
the term to those perceptions caused by the body. Even this is a bit
too broad, and so Descartes defines passions proper as &ldquo;those
perceptions, sensations or emotions of the soul which we refer
particularly to it, and which are caused, maintained and strengthened
by some movement of the spirits&rdquo; (AT XI 349, CSM I 338&ndash;9).
Descartes thereby locates passions squarely in <em>perception</em>,
although he gives a nod to other views by calling them
&ldquo;emotions&rdquo; (motions, changes, agitations, disturbances).
Referring them to the soul allows him to distinguish passions from
other bodily-based perceptions, such as the sense-perceptions we refer
to external objects. What Descartes means by &ldquo;referred to the
soul&rdquo; here is none too clear, except insofar as he maintains
that the experience of the passions cannot be localized in some part
of the body (as can feelings of pain or heat), and indeed, &ldquo;we
do not normally know any proximate cause to which we can refer
them&rdquo; (AT XI 347, CSM I 337). (Note that Descartes uses
&ldquo;cause&rdquo; in several different senses throughout the
<em>Passions</em>; cause here cannot be identified with the object.)
The last part of the definition &ndash; that the passions are
&ldquo;caused, maintained and strengthened by some movement of the
spirits&rdquo; &ndash; is also important for differentiating the
passions from non-bodily-based perceptions, such as voluntary
imaginings. The &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; whose movement Descartes
discusses here are the animal spirits of Galenist physiology,
reinterpreted in light of Harvey&rsquo;s discovery of the circulatory
system and his own mechanist principles: they are simply fine and
lively parts of the blood, rarified by the heart and brain, and
passing through the brain to the nerves and then to the muscles to
produce bodily motions. The physiology of the passions is an important
component in the accounts of the causes, effects, functions and
regulation of the passions. Each of the main passions receives a
detailed description of the bodily changes that accompany it, such as
changes in color, body temperature, facial expression, disposition of
the limbs and the like, which can in turn be attributed to the
movements of the spirits and heart.</p>

<p>
The principal effect of the passions is to &ldquo;move and dispose the
soul to want the things for which they prepare the body&rdquo; (AT XI
359, CSM I 343). They act on the soul by way of &ldquo;the agitation
by which the spirits move the little gland [i.e., the pineal gland] in
the middle of the brain&rdquo; (AT XI 371, CSM I 349), which thereby
excite various perceptions in the soul. (For further discussion of
this topic, see the related entry
 <a href="../pineal-gland/index.html">Descartes and the Pineal Gland</a>.)
 But the pineal gland can be moved by many different causes. For this
reason, Descartes admits that many other kinds of perceptions and
volitions stand in close causal and experiential relations to the
passions proper. Particularly important are what Descartes calls
&ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; or &ldquo;internal emotions,&rdquo; such as
the intellectual devotion felt when contemplating the idea of the true
God, or the sadness that stems from reflecting on my errors. These
have the soul as their cause, and so are properly speaking, volitions,
but they are also affective states, and in embodied creatures like us
are they may be difficult to disentangle from bodily-based
passions.</p>

<p>
Each genuine passion is characterized by an account of its
motivational force (for which the &ldquo;reference to the soul&rdquo;
is important), paired with a description of how it
&ldquo;represents&rdquo; its object, which under normal conditions is
also the cause of the series of bodily changes resulting in the
passion. Although he does not deny that each passion has some
distinctive felt character, Descartes offers no description of it
other than the presentation of the object under some evaluative
description and its effect on the will. In general, the
&ldquo;principal and most common causes&rdquo; are objects, considered
according to &ldquo;the various ways in which they may harm or benefit
us, or in general have importance for us&rdquo; (AT XI 372, CSM I
349). Passions are not judgments, since judgments require an act of
the will to affirm or deny. But they do have complex,
propositional-like contents: through the passion of fear, I perceive
that an oncoming train is dangerous to me, viz., I perceive it as
dangerous. It is because these contents are evaluative that the
passions will be motivating in ways that are normally functional.</p>

<h3><a name="ClaPas">6. The Classification of the Passions</a></h3>

<p>
Descartes identifies six &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; passions: wonder,
which he calls &ldquo;the first of all the passions,&rdquo; love and
hatred, desire, and joy and sadness. They are each distinct: desire,
for instance, is directed at the future, whereas love is a passion
involving a &ldquo;consent by which we consider ourselves from the
present on as joined with which we love, in the sense that we imagine
a whole of which we think of ourselves only as one part and the loved
thing as another&rdquo; (AT XI 387, modified from CSM I 356). And each
of these passions, except for wonder, have a built-in direction of
motion, either appetitive or aversive depending on how they evaluate
their objects &ndash; a feature that serves as an important organizing
principle for Descartes. On this basis, Descartes opposes love to
hatred, and joy to sadness. Desire has no opposite, since it comprises
both appetites and aversions.</p>

<p>
Descartes also accepts &ldquo;an unlimited number&rdquo; of further,
specific passions, which he calls combinations of the six primitive
passions. But he seems to find his most important taxonomical
principles elsewhere, e.g., in the passion&rsquo;s intensity (timidity
is different from terror), whether its object is oneself or another
(self-esteem differs from veneration), and in further modifications of
the object and its relation to us (love is distinguished from the
devotion we feel for an object &ldquo;greater&rdquo; than we are, such
as God). Descartes allows that some passions involve mixtures, even
contrary mixtures as in hope and fear. But since passions literally
push the pineal gland in a particular direction, movements in
different directions tend to cancel each other out. Passions seem to
&lsquo;combine&rsquo; most readily by producing trains of passions:
desire may give rise to love, which may in turn generate joy. Trains
of passions may involve passions with contrary directions, but this
produces the rather uncomfortable sensations of remorse, or
repentance. In fact, Descartes takes it as a basic explanatory
principle that the passions do not oppose each other, and rejects the
Thomist distinction between irascible and concupiscible appetites, and
correlative divisions in the soul itself (AT XI 379, CSM I 352). The
sort of conflicts that this distinction was supposed to explain
Descartes instead attributes to different causes, to movements coming
from the soul (the will) and to movements originating in the body,
which can, but need not, propel the pineal gland in contrary
directions.</p>

<h3><a name="WonGen">7. Wonder and Generosity</a></h3>

<p>
Perhaps the most distinctive of the passions that Descartes
identifies, however is the one that involves no evaluation of its
object: wonder [<em>admiration</em>] merely presents its object as
something novel or unusual. As such, wonder produces no change in the
heart or the blood, which would prepare the body for movement. But it
does involve the motions of the animal spirits through the brain and
into the muscles, thereby fixing an &ldquo;impression&rdquo; of the
object in the brain. And that explains the function of wonder: to
&ldquo;learn and retain in our memory things of which we were
previously ignorant&rdquo; (AT XI 384, CSM I 354). It is our response
to those features of the world worthy of our consideration &ndash;
something useful both for the preservation of the mind-body union and
for the soul itself in its pursuit of knowledge. Wonder also manifests
how our intentionality can become embodied, by bringing bodily
resources to bear in directing our attention to an object (see
Schmitter 2017, also Alanen 2003, chap. 6). Descartes&rsquo;s
understanding of wonder may well recall Aristotle&rsquo;s famous dictum
that philosophy begins with wonder. But wherever it begins, Descartes
certainly does not think it should end there. Wonder at an unfamiliar
object can become excessive, and make us crave novelty simply for its
own sake. Such wonder is only functional if it prompts us to resolve
it in the satisfaction of knowledge.</p>

<p>
Another distinctive passion Descartes describes is generosity
[<em>generosit&eacute;</em>], which produces a kind of self-directed
wonder, or esteem, grounded in our recognition &ldquo;that nothing
really belongs to us other than the free disposition of our
volitions,&rdquo; along with sensing &ldquo;in ourselves at the same
time a firm and constant resolution to use them well&rdquo; (AT XI
446, slightly altered from CSM I 384). It is this passion that seems
to be the keystone for &ldquo;the pursuit of virtue,&rdquo; in
particular because it &ldquo;serves as a remedy against all the
disorders of the passions&rdquo; (AT XI 447, CSM I 385). And although
generosity is a perception directed at the self, combining a knowledge
of what is truly important in and for ourselves with the will to act
on the basis of that knowledge, it seems to generate like esteem for
others: generous people do good without self-interest, are courteous,
gracious and obliging, and live free from contempt, jealousy, envy,
hatred, fear and anger for others. The key seems to be that generous
people &ldquo;are entirely masters of their passions&rdquo; (AT XI
448, modified from CSM I 385).</p>

<h3><a name="RemPas">8. The Remedy for the Passions</a></h3>

<p>
But Descartes does not think that passions should be eradicated
wholesale: they are the sources of &ldquo;the sweetest pleasures in
this life&rdquo; and &ldquo;are all good in their nature&rdquo; (AT XI
485, modified from CSM I 403) &ndash; with the possible exception of
terror. Indeed, since they are functional by nature, it is not
entirely clear why they should require remedy. True, like
sense-perceptions, they can misfunction under non-standard
circumstances. But unlike sense-perceptions, which give us material
for error when we take them at face value in our theoretical
reasonings, our passions do not seem to tempt us into thinking they
reflect the independent structure of the world. It may be that
Descartes holds that there is a conflict between the good for the
mind-body union (preservation) and the good for the soul alone. This
is something Malebranche insists on, and Descartes does allow that the
two goods may fail to coincide (e.g., joy is always good for the soul,
but not necessarily for the union). But his demand for mastery
and&nbsp;management [<i>mesnager</i>] (AT XI 488) seems to be
motivated just as much by the practical concerns of our embodied
state. He identifies the remedy for disorders (or irregularities) of
the passions [<i>les dereglemens des Passions</i>] quite generally
with virtue, and virtue with happiness (AT XI 454). Perhaps though,
the need for a remedy arises from the mechanical causation governing
the physiology of the passions: it makes the passions simply too
coarse to steer us as precisely as they could with further correction
of their excesses and disorders.</p>

<p>
In any case, Descartes clearly allows that our passions, based as they
are on internal bodily dispositions to be moved by external objects,
can conflict with our rationally considered evaluations of those
objects &ndash; or what would be our evaluations, had we the time for
proper deliberation. The disciplined pursuit of virtue averts such
conflict by allowing the soul to improve on untutored nature in its
dealings with its passions. The most important thing, Descartes tells
us, is for the soul to equip itself with &ldquo;firm and determinate
judgments bearing upon the knowledge of good and evil, which the soul
has resolved to follow in guiding its conduct&rdquo; (AT XI 367, CSM I
347). But this is just the first step, for we should also alter our
dispositions to feel the passions, by way of a kind of internal bodily
training generating new and improved &ldquo;habits&rdquo; (AT XI 369,
CSM I 348). What constitutes a &ldquo;habit&rdquo; is a matter of some
controversy: it might be like the process of coming to perceive
certain sounds as words, whereby we produce novel, learned
conjunctions of perceptions and movements in the pineal gland. (This
seems to be the view of Spinoza.) Or it might be a matter of the sort
of physiological changes that take place during the training of
hunting dogs, changes solely in body structure and movements, e.g.,
alterations in the internal structure of the brain and the subsequent
coursing of the animal spirits. (This seems to be the view of
Malebranche.) (On this issue, see Hoffman 1991, partially reprinted in
2009, Shapiro 2003, and Schmitter 2005.)</p>

<h3><a name="InfIma">9. The Influence of the Imagination</a></h3>

<p>
The key to developing those habits that &ldquo;stop the bodily
movements which accompany&rdquo; certain passions seems to lie in the
body, particularly in the corporeal imagination (a part of the brain)
and its practices. Descartes notes that an effective way of countering
an undesirable passion is to imagine a new and different state of
affairs, or response to the state of affairs. The act of imagining
causes brain events, and so can serve as a voluntary, if indirect
means to change the course of the animal spirits and eliminate the
causes of some undesirable passion. More generally, entertaining any
thought at all, especially a clear and distinct thought that we cannot
help but affirm, carries an affective dimension that will in turn
prompt movements in the imagination and the passions. The long-term
consequences of such voluntary, imaginative practice is to reshape our
internal bodily &ldquo;dispositions&rdquo; so that they produce
specific passions under the appropriate, rationally endorsed
circumstances.</p>

<p>
For these and other reasons, remedying the passions is closely related
to the maintenance of health. The pursuit of virtue, in particular, is
presented as a kind of therapeutic and gymnastic regimen for the soul,
one that corrects its weaknesses and increases its strength. It is a
regimen whereby the soul harnesses the imagination and the body in
general to work on itself. <em>Mutatis mutandi</em>, controlling the
passions can have important consequences for bodily health. Exercising
control over the passions means that we are simultaneously exercising
control over the internal motions of the body &ndash; the beatings of
the heart, circulation of the blood and heat, the disposition of the
animal spirits, and so forth. It seems a fortunate fact that the way
reason directs us to shape our passions coincides with the passionate
production of healthful bodily movements (at least if our bodies are
in even minimally working order). This accord between the education of
the passions and the cultivation of health may indeed be
Descartes&rsquo;s trump card for his claim that the passions are good by
nature.</p>

<h3><a name="InfLatAut">10. Influences on Later Authors</a></h3>

<p>
Of course, it is this picture of harmony between the soul and the
mind-body union and the prospect of complete mastery through resolute
practice that Elisabeth found implausibly rosy. Spinoza and
Malebranche will agree with her assessment, and each &ndash; in
different ways &ndash; emphasizes our dependence on what is out of our
control. But Descartes&rsquo;s project remained extremely important,
shaping the classificatory and explanatory apparatus of theories of
the emotions for the next century and a half. The Cartesian feminist
author Fran&ccedil;ois Poulain de la Barre cites both Descartes&rsquo;s
&ldquo;<em>Treatise on the Passions&rdquo; </em>and the correspondence
with Elisabeth as part of a recommended plan of self-education, as
well as using Descartes&rsquo;s taxonomy of the simple passions (<em>On
the Education of Ladies</em> in 2002, 218, 237). The <em>Passions of
the Soul</em> was translated into English with remarkable speed,
appearing by 1650, a mere year after its original publication. As a
result, Descartes exerted a strong influence on British authors, even
those who owed their main allegiances elsewhere, as was the case with
the neo-Epicurean Walter Charleton. Henry More simply inserted chunks
of the <em>Passions of the Soul</em> in his <em>Enchiridion
ethicum</em>, while also appropriating bits and pieces from elsewhere
(including an odd version of the distinction between concupiscible and
irascible passions). In her <em>Serious Proposal to the Ladies, Part
II</em>, Mary Astell cites both Descartes and More as good sources to
understand the nature of the passions and &ldquo;the Use of
&rsquo;em&rdquo; (2002, 218). Even those philosophers determined to break
new ground felt his influence: Descartes&rsquo;s taxonomy, for instance,
clearly played a role in Hobbes&rsquo;s account in the
<em>Leviathan</em>, despite the very different theoretical styles of
the two philosophers. And Descartes&rsquo;s general approach to the
passions as functional remained a bone of contention for generations
to come, one fought over in rather different ways by Hobbes,
Malebranche and Spinoza.</p>

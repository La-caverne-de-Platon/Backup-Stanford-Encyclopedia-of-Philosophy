<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Kant&rsquo;s Philosophical Development</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>  Western philosophy after
the middle ages can be divided into four periods: the Renaissance, the
Enlightenment or modern philosophy, 19<sup>th</sup> Century
philosophy, and 20<sup>th</sup> Century/ the contemporary
period. While determining the boundaries of the periods is a matter of
debate, one could say that the Renaissance ended in the early 1600s;
that the Enlightenment or modernity lasted from the late 1600s to the
late 1700s; and that 19<sup>th</sup> Century philosophy began with
Kant's critique of rational theology and metaphysics, while
20<sup>th</sup> Century philosophy begins with the inception of
positivism and the Vienna circle. Many of the philosophical questions
in the modern period are eclipsed by Kant's critique and much of
19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> Century philosophy responds to the
shift in philosophical paradigm we find in Kant's works.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>  The discovery of Kant's
ambivalence towards Christianity (documented during Kant's lifetime)
is due to the efforts of Manfred Kuehn, University of Marburg. Kant's
first biographers were L.E. Borowski, R.B. Jachmann, and E.A.C.
Wasianski. Their accounts appeared in K&ouml;nigsberg, in the year of
Kant's death (12 Feb. 1804). As the three writers knew their subject
personally&mdash;Borowski had been his frequent guest; Jachmann had
been his research assistant; and Wasianski had been his assistant and
executor of will&mdash;their portraits were accepted as
authoritative. All three had degrees in theology; Jachmann held church
services, Wasianski was a deacon, and Borowski was a church
administrator. They stressed the importance of Pietism for Kant and
presented their subject as a good Christian. This distortion was
partly due to an innocent projection of the biographers' preferences,
but to some extent, it was also a systematic effort at spinning the
facts, especially in the case of Borowski. Borowski worried that his
association with Kant would harm his career and tried to preempt
critics, for Kant's scorn for fundamentalists (<em>Schw&auml;rmer</em>) was
notorious, and his influence was blamed for the empty churches in
town. Kant was cool towards Christianity and did not support its
doctrines. For the distortions of Kant's relation to Christianity, see
Kuehn 2001: 2&ndash;16. For Kant's contempt for organized religion,
disbelief in an afterlife, and rejection of a monotheistic God, see
ibid.: 45&ndash;55, 328, 369&ndash;78, 382, and 392.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a>  See the relevant articles
in Sch&ouml;nfeld 2006c, especially by Wenchao Li/Hans Poser, Thomas Fuchs,
Gregory Reihman, and Martin Sch&ouml;nfeld.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a>  Kant's work spans over
half a century, from 1745 to 1801. The pre-critical period ends with
the <em>Inaugural Dissertation</em> (1770); the critical period begins
with the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> (1781). In old age, with
the <em>Strife of Faculties</em> (1798) and the <em>Opus Postumum</em>
(mainly written 1799&ndash;1801), he advanced claims seemingly at odds
with the critical restrictions espoused earlier; hence the term
&ldquo;post-critical period&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a>  One critical oddity is
Kant's contention that space is a force field (a &ldquo;plenum&rdquo;
instead of a void). The early Kant claims that force created space by
stretching itself out as a continuum. The late Kant claims that
cognitive tools that organize experience are aspects of an energetic,
material, and interactive fabric. This energy-field sustains
consciousness and cognition&mdash;energetic space is the ultimate
condition of experience. Even the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>
contains suggestions of this sort, but there they conflict with the
cautious tenor of the work (such that cognitive conditions are formal,
not physical, or that the underlying fabric, the thing in itself, is
inaccessible). For the early claims, cf. <em>Thoughts on the True
Estimation of Living Forces</em>, #1&ndash;10 (1:17&ndash;25). For the
late claims, cf. the <em>Opus Postumum</em>-material,
especially <em>Reflexion 3986</em>
(17:376&ndash;7), <em>Oktaventwurf</em> (21:378&ndash;9,
383); <em>Transition 1&ndash;14</em> (21:219, 223&ndash;4,
226&ndash;30, 233, 247, 535, 539, 547&ndash;8, 564&ndash;5,
588&ndash;9, 592); <em>Fascicle 11</em> (22:425&ndash;31, 440, 457);
compare also <em>Fascicle 1</em> (21:87.29&ndash;31 and
21:101.5&ndash;12). For the &ldquo;plenum-proof&rdquo; in the
first <em>Critique</em>, cf. A211/B256&ndash;A214/B261; for an
informative analysis, compare Edwards 2000: 13&ndash;47,
esp. 38&ndash;40. For an interpretation of this ontological oddity in
its cross-cultural context, compare Edwards &amp; Sch&ouml;nfeld 2006.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a>  For Kant's views in the
critical and late works, see the following entries:
 <a href="../kant-metaphysics/index.html">Kant's critique of metaphysics</a>,
 <a href="../kant-transcendental/index.html">Kant's transcendental arguments</a>,
 <a href="../kant-spacetime/index.html">Kant's views on space and time</a>.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a>  Harmut and Gernot B&ouml;hme
have argued elsewhere that Kant was deeply marked psychologically by
the death of his mother. Their psychoanalytic reading argues that the
deeper impact of this event provides reported explanation for Kant's
view of morality as freedom from emotional affectation.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a>  Budde rejected in
his <em>Elementa philosophiae theoreticae</em> (&ldquo;Elements of
Theoretical Philosophy&rdquo;) the Copernican heliocentric model
because it does not harmonize with the Scripture
(IV.1). The <em>Elementa</em> was published in 1703&mdash;more than a
century after Copernicus's <em>De Revolutionibus</em> (1543) and two
generations after Galileo's <em>Two World Systems</em> (1632). Lange
deplored in his <em>Medicina Mentis</em> (1704; &ldquo;Medicine of the
Mind&rdquo;) that the disease at the root of Adam's fall is intellect
(part I, chapter 1); its cure depends on prayer and catechetical
tenets (I.2, II.2&ndash;8). Logic, ontology, and natural philosophy
are threats (I.3, V.7); science, as a secular enterprise, produces
heresies and lies (V.5). R&uuml;diger argued in <em>De sensu veri et
falsi</em> (1722; On the Meaning of Truth and Falsehood&rdquo;) that
the mathematics only concerns what is possible and cannot be applied
to reality, thus rejecting quantifications of natural phenomena (II
4:3).  Crusius insisted in <em>Anleitung &uuml;ber nat&uuml;rliche Begebenheiten
ordentlich und vorsichtig nachzudenken</em> (1749; &ldquo;Instructions
on Thinking Orderly and Carefully about Natural Events&rdquo;) that a
physics that quantifies empirical data is misguided (p. 508) and
rejected Newton's physics as a meaningful model of nature (ibid.:
536).</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a>  One such activity Kant
strictly avoided was the <em>Pantoffalparade</em><em>,</em> whereby
university students would line the exits of churches to critically
examine departing young women (Kuehn 2001a: 63).</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>  &ldquo;<em>Nihil magis
praestandum est, quam ne pecorum ritu sequamur antecedentium gregem,
pergentes, non qua eundum est, sed qua itur</em>&rdquo;. See
Seneca, <em>De vita beata</em>, chapter 1. Compare <em>Living
Forces</em> 1:7.2&ndash;3.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a>  Using the term
&ldquo;mass&rdquo; here is somewhat anachronistic. Descartes spoke of
&ldquo;quantity of matter&rdquo; (<em>quantit&eacute; de la
mati&egrave;re</em>), which he identified mostly with size and
occasionally with weight. Leibniz talked about &ldquo;magnitude of the
body&rdquo; (<em>magnitude corporis</em>), which he identified mostly
with weight and occasionally with size. Newton introduced the concept
of &ldquo;mass&rdquo; in <em>De Motu</em> (1684; hypothesis 2) and
explicated it in the <em>Principia</em> (1686; first law). Mass is the
measure of the amount of matter that determines a body's resistance to
acceleration by an applied force. Newton's assumption that mass is
constant works for local situations and speeds. A general definition
of mass requires Einstein's correction that mass will increase at
(very high) velocities.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a>  The principle of the
conservation of momentum and energy results from the convertibility of
mass and energy. It applies to masses moving in spacetime and is
visible in collisions. Momentum and energy, or more precisely, their
combination, are the joint measure of mass. Momentum-energy is
proportional to mass; it is a vector quantity (it depends on
direction); and its arrow points in the same direction as the world
line of the object in spacetime. When masses collide, their momentum
and energy differ before and after impact, but their sum remains
equal.  Momentum-energy is fundamental: its conservation governs every
collision in the universe, and it is also frame-invariant, remaining
the same regardless of the chosen frame of reference.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>  Briefly, Einstein's
first great insight (1905) is that spacetime tells mass how to move,
while mass tells spacetime how to curve (Wheeler 1990: 12). That is,
force and space mutually determine each
other&mdash;&ldquo;force&rdquo; understood as momentum-energy (the
measure of mass, and spacetime's grip on mass), and
&ldquo;space&rdquo; understood as spacetime (the four-dimensional
continuum). Consider the planets on their orbits around the Sun. While
Newton assumed that gravitational forces act over spatial distances to
hold Sun and planets in mutual grip, Einstein realized that
gravitational forces form a field that locally curves space, primarily
around the Sun, such that planets move along the spatial curvature,
tracing out orbits. Hence (to quote Wheeler again, ibid.: 11&ndash;13)
mass grips spacetime, telling it how to curve; spacetime grips
spacetime, transmitting curvature from near to far; and spacetime
grips mass, telling it how to move. Force and space are not
independent absolutes, as Newton had stipulated. Instead, and as
Einstein discovered, both are relative to one another (hence
&ldquo;special theory of relativity&rdquo; as label for the
explication of this idea). Kant realized that force acts
by <em>Ausbreitung</em>&mdash;&ldquo;out-broadening&rdquo; or
radiation, and that the resulting space
has <em>Ausdehnung</em>&mdash;&ldquo;out-stretching&rdquo; or
extension/expansion. As radiation determines extension (by structuring
space), extension determines radiation (by an inverse-square law). In
this sense, by recognizing that radiation and extension hang together,
that neither force nor space stand alone, Kant bypassed Newton and
caught up with Einstein.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>  Kant writes
(1:24.19&ndash;23):</p>

<blockquote><p> Accordingly I am of the opinion that substances in the
existing world, of which we are a part, have essential forces of such
a kind that they propagate their effects in union with each other
according to the inverse-square relation of the
distances.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>  Johannes Kepler
formulated the inverse-square law in the <em>Astronomia pars
optica</em> (1604). Kepler showed that the intensity of light
decreases with the square of the distance (prop. 9);
cf. <em>Werke</em> 2:22. He characterized light as the primordial
living force, cf. chap. 1 (sec.  &ldquo;Lucis
encomium&rdquo;), <em>Werke</em> 2:19. He suspected the identity of
the radiation of light and gravity, and applied the inverse-square law
to gravitation; cf. letter to David Fabricius (11
Oct. 1605), <em>Werke</em> 15:241, and <em>Astronomia nova</em>
(1609), introduction (sec. &ldquo;Vera doctrina de
gravitate&rdquo;), <em>Werke</em> 3:25. Newton tied the inverse-square
to Kepler's planetary laws (1684) and derived it for gravity
(1687).</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>  Bilfinger was known
for a work on Confucianism (1724), a quasi-Taoist commentary on
Wolff's <em>German Metaphysics</em> (1725), and a tract on force
(1728).  Wolff's speech on the Chinese (1721)&mdash;a watershed event
in the Enlightenment&mdash;had motivated him, then at T&uuml;bingen, to
study these provocative pagans (in 1726 Wolff would cite Bilfinger
when preparing his speech for print). In Taoist ontology, the dynamic
principle (Tao) weaves the world by &ldquo;stretching out&rdquo; the
void (<em>dao zhong</em>) and that produces things and life by
individuating the resulting field into lingering wholes. Nature and
the good are opposites but harmonize in their parallel thrust toward
sustainable complexity. Moral practice is their alignment. Bilfinger
stressed the significance of this thrust, in the guise of
Aristotle's <em>possibilitas</em> or <em>dynamis</em>, in his Wolffian
commentary.  The theologians at T&uuml;bingen were upset, and Bilfinger
lost his job. He joined Daniel Bernoulli (1700&ndash;82) at the
Russian Academy to study dynamics&mdash;and the resulting tract on
force inspired Kant in not-too-distant K&ouml;nigsberg two decades
later. Bilfinger's book on Chinese philosophy is <em>Specimen
doctrinae veterum Sinarum moralis et politicae</em> (1724;
&ldquo;Specimen of the Moral and Political Teachings of the Ancient
Chinese&rdquo;); his commentary on Wolff's <em>German Metaphysics</em>
(1719) is
<em>Dilucidationes philosophicae de Deo, anima humana, mundo et
generalibus rerum affectionibus</em> (1725, &ldquo;Philosophical
Dilucidations of God, the Human Soul, the Word, and the General
Impressions of Things&rdquo;); and his treatise on force is <em>De
viribus corpori moto insitis et illarum mensura</em>,
(w. 1725&ndash;6, p. 1728; &ldquo;On the Essential Forces of Bodily
Motion and their Measure&rdquo;). He states his heuristic rule
in <em>De viribus</em> #16. In his study of Chinese thought, Bilfinger
was taken by the <em>Doctrine of the Mean</em> (<em>Zhong
Yong</em>). This Confucian classic strikes a bridge to Taoism (whose
chief text, the <em>Tao Te Ching</em>, would arrive in the West
later). The <em>Doctrine of the Mean</em> describes nature as a web of
force-points and humans as nodes in the web. It begins with,</p>

<blockquote><p> what cosmos imparts to humans is called vitality;
following vitality is called the Way; and cultivating the Way is
called education
</p></blockquote>

<p>
cf. <em>Zhongyong Jiyi</em> (Taibei: Sangyang 1985), 2 (my
trans.). The text had been printed twice; Wolff knew the work in
No&euml;l's translation (<em>Immutabile medium</em>, 1711), and Bilfinger
in Couplet's earlier version (<em>Medium sempiternum</em>, 1687). In
the <em>Specimen</em>, Bilfinger explains that vitality and Tao are
aspects of a unified idea constitutive of creation and good, and
refers to his idea as &ldquo;light of reason&rdquo; (<em>lumen
rationis</em>; #41, margin).  See Sch&ouml;nfeldb. Kant was ignorant of the
Chinese but absorbed the Taoist motif. The middle way is not a
lukewarm compromise but a dialectical harmony of opposites in a golden
mean. Bilfinger's transmission of the Tao involved a Western spin:
while Taoism stresses the paradoxical essence of nature, the Jesuit
translators of Tao as &ldquo;light of nature&rdquo; (<em>lumen
naturalis</em>) and &ldquo;rational nature&rdquo; (<em>natura
rationalis</em>) had read it to mean that nature is consistent and
rational&mdash;which is, of course, a premise of scientific
research. Kant says that he put Bilfinger's rule to good use (#20;
1:32), and he certainly did&mdash;it led him to reconcile momentum and
energy, force and space, field and void, mind and matter, and God and
nature. It was Kant's universal rule, guiding him at the time. It is
an irony that one of the West's greatest thinkers was first inspired
by the Tao of the East.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>  Kepler,
in <em>Harmonice Mundi</em>, composed melodies for planets, which
allowed him to discover the Harmonic Law&mdash;the square of the
periodic times are to each other as the cubes of the mean
distance. The Harmonic Law is Kepler's third planetary law; it
concerns the relation of planetary orbits and solar distances, such
that the squares of the periodical times <em>t</em> of the planets in
their orbits around the Sun are to one another as the cubes of their
distances <em>r</em> from the sun, or <i>t</i><sup>2</sup>

<a href="index-2.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a> See <em>Universal
Natural History</em>, 1:264&ndash;6 for the general structural-dynamic
formation of the cosmos, 231.18&ndash;209 for star motions,
250.5&ndash;24 for galactic formation, 255.24&ndash;6 for analogous
formation of distant galaxies; 250.34&ndash;6 for analogous formation
of planetary systems; and 256.11&ndash;14 for the galactic
field. Kant's nebular hypothesis of star and galaxy formation was
proposed once more, in a slightly different version, by P.S. de
Laplace (1796), and was confirmed by C.F.v. Weizs&auml;cker and J.G. Kuiper
(1944). The discovery that the &ldquo;foggy stars&rdquo;
(<em>neblichte Sterne</em>) are star clusters and galaxies is
sometimes credited to T.  Wright (1750). But as various commentators
pointed out, the credit goes to Kant, not Wright. Wright states the
idea as a conjecture; Kant integrated it in the correct Newtonian
framework. Kant's galactic hypothesis was reformulated by H. Curtis
and confirmed by E. Hubble (1921).</p>

<a href="index-2.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a>  For final causes and
divine design, cf. the &ldquo;Scholium Generale&rdquo; in Newton 1972
[1726]: 2:760&ndash;3. For the loss of motion as a general feature of
nature, cf. &ldquo;Query 31&rdquo; in Newton 1979 [1730]:
399&ndash;400. For the need of God to sustain nature, see the letter
to Richard Bentley (25 February 1693), in which Newton argues:
&ldquo;this frame of things could not always subsist without a divine
power to conserve it&rdquo;; cf. Newton 1953: 56.</p>

Pope, <em>An Essay on Man</em> (written 1730&ndash;32, printed

<a href="index-2.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>  See Christian
Wolff, <em>Deutsche Teleologie</em> (1723) #2, 8, 47. William
Derham's <em>Physikotheologie</em> (1714) and Bernhard
Niewentyt's <em>Het regt gebruik der Werelt geschowingen</em> (1715)
inspired Wolff. For the views of the physico-theologians,
cf. Sch&ouml;nfeld 2000: 96&ndash;106.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>  See Bernard le Boyer
de Fontenelle, <em>Entretiens sur la pluralit&eacute; des mondes habit&eacute;s</em>
(1686), especially &ldquo;3<sup>ieme</sup> soir&rdquo;,
in <em>Oeuvres</em> 2:70. Fontenelle's <em>Entretiens</em> was a
best-selling introduction to astronomy in its day, inspired by
Copernicus, Kepler, and others.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a>  Kant's identity as the
author was discovered within a year. The classified ads of the
local <em>W&ouml;chentlichen Frag- und Anzeigungs-Nachrichten</em> (1 May
1756) contained the note: &ldquo;Book printer Driest sells: Magister
Kant's <em>Universal Natural History and Theory of the
Heavens</em>&rdquo;. See Rahts 1902: 545. For details on
the <em>Universal Natural History</em>, see Sch&ouml;nfeld 2000:
88&ndash;127 and 264&ndash;74.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a>  If one wanted to
visualize this fluidly rising energy, then Kant's precursor Kepler
would propose the use of light. It is as hot as it gets when focused
to a point, and it radiantly pulses upward toward complexity. Its
shine flares out material dust, floods of particles, like streamers of
smoke.  Since it impels the dust as their vector, the blaze
illuminates the particles. A suggestive image by Albrecht Altdorfer
(1480&ndash;1538) is the sun at the fiery bottom of a tunnel of
clouds, fleeing the slaughter of the East, on the
canvas <em>Alexanderschlacht</em> (&ldquo;Alexander's Battle,&rdquo;
1529). See Johannes Kepler, <em>Astronomia pars optica</em> (1604:
chap. 1), &ldquo;De natura lucis,&rdquo; <em>Werke</em> 2:18&ndash;45,
especially the section &ldquo;Lucis encomium,&rdquo; <em>Werke</em>
2:18&ndash;20. See also Alexanderschlacht&mdash;Albrecht
Altdorfer.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a>  This very observation
will have a significant impact on German Idealism as it develops after
Kant's body of work. See J.G. Fichte <em>Wissenschaflehre</em> (I,
420; I, 93; I, 109), also F.W.J. Schelling <em>System of
Transcendental Idealism</em> (1800: 378&ndash;381). </p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a>  Kant's argument is as
follows: something is possible only if it is thinkable; something is
thinkable only if data are present to the mind; data can be present to
the mind only if the complete set of thinkable data already exists;
therefore something is possible only if something exists. Because
negation of possibility is impossible, what is presupposed as existing
must exist necessarily. Kant shows in summary form (2:84&ndash;9) that
the complete set of thinkable data is the complete set of all positive
properties, which is unified as a set, and divine in virtue of its
completeness. For details, see Sch&ouml;nfeld 2000: 183&ndash;208 and
288&ndash;97.</p>

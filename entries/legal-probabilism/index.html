<h1>Legal Probabilism</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Tue Jun 8, 2021</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
Legal probabilism is a research program that relies on probability
theory to analyze, model and improve the evaluation of evidence and
the process of decision-making in trial proceedings. While the
expression &ldquo;legal probabilism&rdquo; seems to have been coined
by Haack (2014b), the underlying idea can be traced back to the early
days of probability theory (see, for example, Bernoulli 1713). Another
term that is sometimes encountered in the literature is &ldquo;trial
by mathematics&rdquo; coined by Tribe (1971). Legal probabilism
remains a minority view among legal scholars, but attained greater
popularity in the second half of the twentieth century in conjunction
with the law and economics movement (Becker 1968; Calabresi 1961;
Posner 1973).</p>

<p>
To illustrate the range of applications of legal probabilism, consider
a stylized case. Alice is charged with murder. Traces at the crime
scene, which the perpetrator probably left, genetically match
Alice. An eyewitness testifies that Alice ran away from the scene
after the crime was committed. Another witness asserts that Alice had
previously threatened the victim multiple times. Alice, however, has
an alibi. Mark claims he was with her for the entire day. This case
raises several questions. How should the evidence be evaluated? How to
combine conflicting pieces of evidence, such as the incriminating DNA
match and the alibi testimony? If the standard of decision in a murder
case is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, how strong should the
evidence be to meet this standard?</p>

<p>
Legal probabilism is a theoretical framework
that helps to address these different questions. Finkelstein and
Fairley (1970) gave one of the first systematic analyses of how
probability theory, and Bayes&rsquo; theorem in particular, can help
to evaluate evidence at trial (see
 <a href="#ProbTool">Section 1</a>).
 After the discovery of DNA fingerprinting, many legal probabilists
focused on how probability theory could be used to quantify the
strength of a DNA match (see
 <a href="#StreEvid">Section 2</a>).
 Recent work in Artificial Intelligence made it possible to use
probability theory&mdash;in the form of Bayesian networks&mdash;to
evaluate complex bodies of evidence consisting of multiple components
(see
 <a href="#BayeNetwForLegaAppl">Section 3</a>).
 Following the work of Lempert (1977), likelihood ratios are now
commonly used as probabilistic measures of the relevance of the
evidence presented at trial (see
 <a href="#Rele">Section 4</a>).
 Other authors, starting with seminal papers by Kaplan (1968) and Cullison (1969),
deployed probability theory and decision theory to model decision-making and standards of
proof at trial (see
 <a href="#StanProo">Section 5</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Legal probabilism is no doubt controversial. Many legal theorists and
philosophers, starting with Tribe (1971), leveled several critiques
against it. These critiques range from difficulties in assessing the
probability of someone&rsquo;s criminal or civil liability to the
dehumanization of trial decisions to misconstruing how the process of evidence evaluation and decision-making takes place in trial proceedings.</p>

<p>
A key challenge for legal probabilism&mdash;one that has
galvanized philosophical attention in recent years&mdash;comes from
the paradoxes of legal proof or puzzles of naked statistical evidence. Nesson (1979), Cohen (1977) and Thomson
(1986) formulated scenarios in which, despite a high probability of
guilt or civil liability based on the available evidence, a verdict
against the defendant seems unwarranted (see
 <a href="#NakeStatEvid">Section 6</a>).
 Other challenges for legal probabilism include the problem of
conjunction and the reference class problem (see
 <a href="#FurtObje">Section 7</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Legal probabilism can also be understood as a far reaching research
program that aims to analyze&mdash;by means of probability
theory&mdash;the trial system as a whole, including institutions such
as the jury system and trial procedure. Some early French probability
theorists examined the relationship between jury size, jury voting
rules and the risk of convicting an innocent (Condorcet 1785; Laplace
1814; Poisson 1837; for more recent discussions, see Kaye 1980;
Nitzan 2009; Suzuki 2015).</p>

<p>
At the root of this more radical version of legal probabilism lies the
dream of discerning patterns in the behavior of individuals and
improving legal institutions (Hacking 1990). Today&rsquo;s rapid grow
of data&mdash;paired with machine learning and the pervasiveness of
cost-benefit analysis&mdash;has rendered this dream more alive than
ever before (Ferguson 2020). For a critique of mathematization,
quantification and cost-benefit analysis applied to the justice
system, see Allen (2013) and Harcourt (2018). This entry will not, however, discuss
this far reaching version of legal probabilism.</p>

<p>
This section begins with a review of the axioms of probability and its
interpretations, and then shows how probability theory helps to spot
mistakes that people may fall prey to when they assess evidence at
trial, such as the prosecutor&rsquo;s fallacy, the base rate fallacy,
and the defense attorney&rsquo;s fallacy. This section also examines
how probabilities are assigned to hypotheses and how hypotheses are
formulated at different levels of granularity.</p>

<h3 id="ProbInte">1.1 Probability and its interpretation</h3>

<p>
Standard probability theory consists of three axioms:</p>

<div>

<table class="center cellpad-small vert-top shortcap hrulesTH" id="table1">
<caption>Table 1</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th class="bold">Axiom</th>
<th class="bold">In words</th>
<th class="bold">In symbols</th> </tr> </thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td class="bold nobr">Non-negativity</td>
  <td style="text-align:left">The probability of any proposition \(A\)
is greater than or equal to 0.</td>
  <td>\(\Pr(A)\geq 0\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td class="bold">Normality</td>
  <td style="text-align:left">The probability of any logical tautology
is 1.</td>
  <td>If \(\models A\), then \(\Pr(A)=1\)</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td class="bold">Additivity</td>
  <td style="text-align:left"> The probability of the disjunction of
two propositions \(A\) and \(B\) is the sum of their respective
probabilities, provided the two propositions are logically
incompatible.</td>
  <td>If \(\models \neg (A \wedge B)\), then \(\Pr(A\vee
B)=\Pr(A)+\Pr(B)\)</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p>
An important notion in probability theory is that of conditional
probability, that is, the probability of a proposition \(A\)
conditional on a proposition \(B\), in symbols, \(\Pr( A\pmid B)\).
Although it is sometimes taken as a primitive notion, conditional
probability is usually defined as the probability of the conjunction
\(\Pr(A \wedge B)\) divided by the probability of the proposition
being conditioned on, \(\Pr(B)\), or in other words, </p> 

\[\Pr(A \pmid B)= \frac{\Pr(A \wedge B)}{\Pr(B)}\quad \text{ assuming \(\Pr(B)\neq 0\).}\]

<p>
This notion is crucial in legal applications. The fact-finders at
trial might want to know the probability of &ldquo;The defendant was
at the scene when the crime was committed&rdquo; conditional on
&ldquo;Mrs. Dale asserts she saw the defendant run away from the
scene&rdquo;. Or they might want to know the probability of &ldquo;The
defendant is the source of the traces found at the crime scene&rdquo;
conditional on &ldquo;The DNA expert asserts that the
defendant&rsquo;s DNA matches the traces at the scene.&rdquo; In
general, the fact-finders are interested in the probability of a given
hypothesis \(H\) about what happened conditional on the available
evidence \(E\), in symbols, \(\Pr(H \pmid E)\).</p>

<p>
Most legal probabilists agree that the probabilities ascribed to
statements that are disputed in a trial&mdash;such as &ldquo;The
defendant is the source of the crime traces&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
defendant was at the crime scene when the crime was
committed&rdquo;&mdash;should be understood as evidence-based degrees
of belief (see, for example, Cullison 1969; Kaye 1979b; Nance
 2016). This interpretation addresses the worry that since past events did or
did not happen, their probabilities should be 1 or 0. Even if the
objective chances are 1 or 0, statements about past events could still
be assigned different degrees of belief given the evidence available.
In addition, degrees of belief are better suited than frequencies for
applications to unrepeatable events, such as actions of individuals,
which are often the focus of trial disputes Further engagement with these issues lies beyond the scope of this
entry (for a more extensive discussion, see the entry on the
 <a href="../probability-interpret/index.html">interpretations of probability</a> as well as Childers 2013; Gillies 2000; Mellor 2004; Skyrms 1966).</p>

<p>
Some worry that, except for obeying the axioms of probability, degrees
of belief are in the end assigned in a subjective and arbitrary manner
(Allen and Pardo 2019). This worry can be alleviated by noting that
degrees of belief should reflect a conscientious assessment of the
evidence available which may also include empirical frequencies (see
 <a href="#ProbFall">&sect;1.2</a>
 below and the examples in ENFSI 2015). In some cases, however, the
relevant empirical frequencies will not be available. When this
happens, degrees of belief can still be assessed by relying on common
sense and experience. Sometimes there will be no need to assign exact
probabilities to every statement about the past. In such cases, the relevant probabilities can be expressed approximately with sets of
probability measures (Shafer 1976; Walley 1991), probability
distributions over parameter values, or intervals (see later in
 <a href="#WherDoNumbCome">&sect;1.4</a>).</p>
 
<h3 id="ProbFall">1.2 Probabilistic fallacies</h3>

<p>
Setting aside the practical difficulties of assigning probabilities to
different statements, probability theory is a valuable analytical tool in
detecting misinterpretations of the evidence and reasoning fallacies
that may otherwise go unnoticed.</p>

<h4 id="AssuInde">1.2.1 Assuming independence</h4>

<p>
A common error that probability theory helps to identify consists in
assuming without justification that two events are independent of one
another. A theorem of probability theory states that the probability
of the conjunction of two events, \(A\wedge B\), equals the product of
the probabilities of the conjuncts, \(A\) and \(B\), that is, </p>

\[\Pr(A \wedge B)  = \Pr(A)\times \Pr(B),\] 

<p>
provided \(A\) and \(B\) are independent of one another in the sense
that the conditional probability \(\Pr(A \pmid B)\) is the same as the
unconditional probability \(\Pr(A)\). More formally, note that </p>

\[\Pr(A \pmid B)=\frac{\Pr(A \wedge B)}{\Pr(B)},\]

<p>
so</p> 

 \[\Pr(A \wedge B)=\Pr(A)\times \Pr(B)\]

<p>
provided \(\Pr(A)=\Pr(A \pmid B)\). The latter equality means that learning about \(B\) does not change one's degree of belief about 
\(A\).</p>

<p>
The trial of Janet and Malcolm Collins, a couple accused of robbery in
1964 Los Angeles, illustrates how the lack of independence between
events can be overlooked. The couple was identified based on features
at the time considered unusual. The prosecutor called an expert
witness, a college mathematician, to the stand, and asked him to
consider the following features and assume they had the following
probabilities: black man with a beard (1 in 10), man with a mustache
(1 in 4), white woman with blond hair (1 out of 3), woman with a
ponytail (1 out of 10), interracial couple in a car (1 out of 1000),
couple driving a yellow convertible (1 out of 10). The mathematician,
correctly, calculated the probability of a random couple displaying
all these features on the assumption of independence: 1 in 12 million
(assuming the individual probability estimates were correct). Relying
on this argument, the jury convicted the couple. If those features are
so rare in Los Angeles and the robbers had them&mdash;the jury must
have reasoned&mdash;the Collins must be the robbers.</p>

<p>
The conviction was later reversed by the Supreme Court of California
in <span class="casecite">People v. Collins (68 Cal.2d 319,
1968)</span>. The Court pointed out the mistake of assuming that
multiplying the probabilities of each feature would give the
probability of their joint occurrence. This assumption holds only if
the features in question are probabilistically independent. But this
is not the case since the occurrence of, say, the feature &ldquo;man
with a beard&rdquo; might very well correlate with the feature
&ldquo;man with a mustache&rdquo;. The same correlation might hold for
the features &ldquo;white woman with blond hair&rdquo; and
&ldquo;woman with a ponytail&rdquo;. Besides the lack of independence,
another problem is the fact that the probabilities associated with
each feature were not obtained by any reliable method.</p>

<p>
The British case <span class="casecite">R. v. Clark (EWCA Crim 54,
2000)</span> is another example of how the lack of independence
between events can be easily overlooked. Sally Clark had two sons. Her
first son died in 1996 and her second son died in similar
circumstances a few years later in 1998. They both died within a few
weeks after birth. Could it just be a coincidence? At trial, the
paediatrician Roy Meadow testified that the probability that a child
from an affluent family such as the Clark&rsquo;s would die of Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) was 1 in 8,543. Assuming that the two
deaths were independent events, Meadow calculated that the probability
of both children dying of SIDS was</p> 

\[\frac{1}{8,543}\times \frac{1}{8,543}, \quad \text{which approximately equals} \quad \frac{1}{73\times 10^6}\]

<p>
or 1 in 73 million. This impressively low number no doubt played a
role in the outcome of the case. Sally Clark was convicted of
murdering her two infant sons (though the conviction was ultimately
reversed on appeal). The \(\slashfrac{1}{(73\times 10^6)}\) figure
rests on the assumption of independence. This assumption is seemingly
false since environmental or genetic factors may predispose a family
to SIDS (for a fuller discussion of this point, see Dawid 2002; Barker
2017; Sesardic 2007).</p>

<h4 id="ProsFall">1.2.2 The prosecutor&rsquo;s fallacy</h4>

<p>
Another mistake that people often make while assessing the evidence
presented at trial consists in conflating the two directions of
conditional probability, \(\Pr(A\pmid B)\) and \(\Pr(B \pmid A)\). For
instance, if you toss a die, the probability that the result is 2
given that it is even (which equals \(\slashfrac{1}{3}\)) is different
from the probability that the result is even given that it is 2 (which
equals 1).</p>

<p>
In criminal cases, confusion about the two directions of conditional
probability can lead to exaggerating the probability of the
prosecutor&rsquo;s hypothesis. Suppose an expert testifies that the
blood found at the crime scene matches the defendant&rsquo;s and it is
5% probable that a person unrelated to the crime&mdash;someone who is
<em>not</em> the source of the blood found at the scene&mdash;would
match by coincidence. Some may be tempted to interpret this statement
as saying that the probability that the defendant is not the source of
the blood is 5% and thus it is 95% probable that the defendant is the
source. This flawed interpretation is known as the
<em>prosecutor&rsquo;s fallacy</em>, sometimes also called the <em>transposition fallacy</em> (Thompson and Schumann 1987).
The 5% figure is the conditional probability \(\Pr(\match \pmid \neg
\source)\) that, assuming the defendant is not the <em>source</em> of
the crime scene blood \((\neg \source),\) he would
still <em>match</em> \((\match).\) The 5% figure is not the
probability \(\Pr(\neg \source \pmid \match)\) that, if the defendant
matches (\(\match\)), he is not the source (\(\neg \source\)). By
conflating the two directions and thinking that
</p> 

\[\Pr(\neg \source \pmid \match)=\Pr(\match \pmid \neg \source)=5\%,\]

<p>
one is led to erroneously conclude that \(\Pr(\source \pmid
\match)=95\%\).</p>

<p>
The same conflation occurred in the Collins case discussed earlier.
Even if the calculations were correct, the 1 in 12 million probability
that a random couple would have the specified characteristics should
be interpreted as \(\Pr(\match\pmid \textsf{innocent})\), not as the
probability that the Collins were innocent given that they matched the
eyewitness description, \(\Pr(\textsf{innocent}\pmid \match)\).
Presumably, the jurors convicted the Collins because they thought it
was virtually impossible that they were not the robbers. But the 1 in 12
million figure, assuming it is correct, only shows that
\(\Pr(\match\pmid \textsf{innocent})\) equals
\(\slashfrac{1}{(12\times 10^6)}\), not that
\(\Pr(\textsf{innocent}\pmid \match)\) equals
\(\slashfrac{1}{(12\times 10^6)}\).</p>

<h4 id="BayeTheoBaseRateFall">1.2.3 Bayes&rsquo; theorem and the base rate fallacy</h4>

<p>
The relation between the probability of the hypothesis given the
evidence, \(\Pr(H \pmid E)\), and the probability of the evidence
given the hypothesis, \(\Pr(E \pmid H)\), is captured by Bayes&rsquo;
theorem: </p> 

\[
\Pr(H \pmid E)  =  \frac{\Pr(E \pmid H)}{\Pr(E)} \times \Pr(H),\quad\text{  assuming } \Pr(E) \neq 0.\] 

<p>
The probability \(\Pr(H)\) is called the <em>prior</em> probability of
\(H\) (it is prior to taking evidence \(E\) into account) and
\(\Pr(H\pmid E)\) is the <em>posterior</em> probability of \(H\). This
terminology is standard, but is slightly misleading because it
suggests a temporal ordering which does not have to be there. Next,
consider the ratio</p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(E \pmid H)}{\Pr(E)},\]

<p>
sometimes called the <em>Bayes
 factor</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 This is the ratio between the probability \(\Pr(E \pmid H)\) of
observing evidence \(E\) assuming \(H\) (often called
the likelihood) and the probability \(\Pr(E)\) of observing \(E\). By the <em>law of total probability</em>,
\(\Pr(E)\) results from adding the probability of observing \(E\)
assuming \(H\) and the probability of observing \(E\) assuming \(\neg
H\), each weighted by the prior probabilities of \(H\) and \(\neg H\)
respectively:</p> 

 \[\Pr(E)= \Pr(E \pmid H)\times \Pr(H)+\Pr(E \pmid \neg H)\times \Pr(\neg H).\]

<p>
As is apparent from Bayes&rsquo; theorem, multiplying the prior
probability by the Bayes factor yields the posterior probability \(\Pr(H \pmid E)\). Other things being equal, the lower the prior probability \(\Pr(H)\), the lower the
posterior probability \(\Pr(H \pmid E)\). The <em>base rate
fallacy</em> consists in ignoring the effect of the prior probability
on the posterior (Kahneman and Tversky 1973). This leads to thinking
that the posterior probability of a hypothesis given the evidence is
different than it actually is (Koehler 1996).</p>

<p>
Consider the blood evidence example discussed previously. By
Bayes&rsquo; theorem, the two conditional probabilities \(\Pr(\neg
\source \pmid \match)\) and \(\Pr(\match \pmid \neg \source)\) are
related as follows:</p>

<!--pdf include  

<div style="font-size:90%">
pdf include--> 

\[
 \Pr(\neg \source \pmid \match)  = \\ \frac{\Pr(\match \pmid \neg \source)\times \Pr(\neg \source)}
{\Pr(\match \pmid \neg \source)\times \Pr(\neg \source)
+ \Pr(\match \pmid \source)\times \Pr(\source)}.
\]

<!--pdf include </div>
pdf include-->

<p>
Absent any other compelling evidence to the contrary, it should
initially be very likely that the defendant, as anyone else, had
little to do with the crime. Say, for illustrative purposes, that the
prior probability \(\Pr(\neg \source)= .99\) and so
\(\Pr(\source)=.01\) (more on how to assess prior probabilities later
in
 <a href="#WherDoNumbCome">&sect;1.4</a>).
 Next, \(\Pr(\match \pmid \source)\) can be set approximately to
\(1\), because if the defendant were the source of the blood at the
crime scene, he should match the blood at the scene (setting aside the
possibility of false negatives). The expert estimated the probability
that someone who is not the source would coincidentally match the
blood found at the scene&mdash;that is, \(\Pr(\match \pmid \neg
\source)\)&mdash;as equal to .05. By Bayes&rsquo; theorem, </p>

\[
\Pr(\neg \source \pmid \match)  = \frac{.05}{(.05 \times .99)+ (1 \times .01)} \times .99 \approx .83.\]

<p>
The posterior probability that the defendant is the source,
\(\Pr(\source\pmid \match)\) is roughly \(1-.83=.17\), much lower than
the exaggerated value of .95. This posterior probability would have
dropped even lower if the prior probability were lower. A similar
analysis applies to the Collins case. If the prior probability of the
Collins&rsquo;s guilt is sufficiently low&mdash;say in 1 in 6
million&mdash;the posterior guilt probability given the match with the
eyewitness description would be roughly .7, much less impressive
than</p> 

\[\left(1-\frac{1}{12\times 10^6}\right)\approx .9999999.\]

<h4 id="DefeAttoFall">1.2.4 Defense attorney&rsquo;s fallacy</h4>

<p>
Although base rate information should not be overlooked, paying
excessive attention to it and ignoring other evidence leads to the
so-called <em>defense attorney&rsquo;s fallacy</em>. As before,
suppose the prosecutor expert testifies that the defendant matches the
traces found at the crime scene and there is a 5% probability that a
random person, unrelated to the crime, would coincidentally match, so
\(\Pr(\match\pmid \neg\source)=.05\). To claim that it is 95% likely
that the defendant is the source of the traces, or in symbols,
\(\Pr(\source\pmid \textsf{ match})=.95\), would be to commit the
prosecutor&rsquo;s fallacy described earlier. But suppose the defense
argues that, since the population in town is 10,000 people, \(5\%\) of
them would match by coincidence, that is, \(10,000\times 5\%=500\)
people. Since the defendant could have left the traces as any of the
other 499 people, he is \(\slashfrac{1}{500}=.2\%\) likely to be the
source, a rather unimpressive figure. The match&mdash;the defense
concludes&mdash;is worthless evidence.</p>

<p>
This analysis portrays the prosecutor&rsquo;s case as weaker than it
need be. If the investigators narrowed down the set of suspects to,
say, 100 people&mdash;a potential piece of information the defense
ignored&mdash;the match would make the defendant 16% likely to be the
source. This fact can be verified using Bayes&rsquo; theorem (left as
an exercise for the reader). Even assuming, as the defense claims,
that the pool of suspects comprises as many as 10,000 people, the
prior probability that the defendant is the source would be
\(\slashfrac{1}{10,000}\), and since the defendant matches the traces,
this probability should rise to (approximately)
\(\slashfrac{1}{500}\). Given the upward shift in the probability from
\(\slashfrac{1}{10,000}\) to \(\slashfrac{1}{500}\), the match should
not be considered worthless evidence (more on this later in
 <a href="#BayeFactVLikeRati">&sect;2.1</a>).</p>
 

<h3 id="OddsVersBayeTheo">1.3 Odds version of Bayes&rsquo; theorem</h3>

<p>
The version of Bayes&rsquo; theorem considered so far is
informationally demanding since the law of total
probability&mdash;which spells out \(\Pr(E)\), the denominator in the
Bayes factor \(\slashfrac{\Pr(E \pmid H)}{\Pr(E)}\)&mdash;requires
one to consider \(H\) and the catch-all alternative hypothesis \(\neg
H\), comprising all possible alternatives to \(H\). A simpler version
of Bayes&rsquo; theorem is the so-called odds formulation:</p>

 \[
\frac{\Pr(H \pmid E)} {\Pr(H' \pmid E)} = \frac{\Pr(E \pmid H)}{\Pr(E \pmid H')} \times \frac{\Pr(H)} {\Pr(H')},\]

<p>
or in words:</p> 

 \[\textit{posterior odds} = \textit{likelihood ratio} \times \textit{prior odds}.\]

<p>
The ratio </p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(H)}{\Pr(H')}\]

<p>
represents the <em>prior odds</em>, where \(H\) and \(H'\) are two
competing hypotheses, not necessarily one the complement of the other.
The <em>likelihood ratio</em></p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(E \pmid H)}{\Pr(E \pmid H')}\]

<p>
compares the probability of the same item of evidence \(E\) given the
two hypotheses. The <em>posterior odds</em> </p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(H \pmid E)}{\Pr(H' \pmid E)}\]

<p>
compares the probabilities of the hypotheses given the evidence. This
ratio is different from the probability \(\Pr(H \pmid E)\) of a
specific hypothesis given the evidence.</p>

<p>
As an illustration, consider the Sally Clark case (previously
discussed in
 <a href="#ProbFall">&sect;1.2</a>).
 The two hypotheses to compare are that Sally Clark&rsquo;s sons died
of natural causes (<span class="sans-serif">natural</span>) and that
Clark killed them (<span class="sans-serif">kill</span>). The evidence
available is that the two sons died in similar circumstances one after
the other (<span class="sans-serif">two deaths</span>). By
Bayes&rsquo; theorem (in the odds version), </p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(\textsf{kill} \pmid \textsf{two deaths})}{\Pr(\textsf{natural} \pmid \textsf{two deaths})} = 
 \frac{\Pr(\textsf{two deaths} \pmid \textsf{kill})}{\Pr(\textsf{two deaths} \pmid \textsf{natural})} 
 \times 
 \frac{\Pr(\textsf{kill})}{\Pr(\textsf{natural})}.\] 

<p>
The likelihood ratio</p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(\textsf{two deaths} \pmid \textsf{kill})}{\Pr(\textsf{two deaths} \pmid \textsf{natural})}\]

<p>
compares the likelihood of the evidence (<span class="sans-serif">two
deaths</span>) under each hypothesis (<span class="sans-serif">kill</span>
v. <span class="sans-serif">natural</span>).
Since under either hypothesis both
babies would have died&mdash;by natural causes or killing&mdash;the
ratio should equal to one (Dawid 2002). What about the prior odds</p>

\[\frac{\Pr(\textsf{kill})}{\Pr(\textsf{natural})}?\]

<p>
Recall the \(\slashfrac{1}{(73\times 10^6)}\) figure given by the
pediatrician Roy Meadow. This figure was intended to convey how
unlikely it was that two babies would die of natural causes, one after
the other. If it is so unlikely that both would die of natural
causes&mdash;one might reason&mdash;it must be likely that they did
not actually die of natural causes and quite likely that Clark killed
them. But did she?</p>

<p>
The prior probability that they died of natural causes should be
compared to the prior probability that a mother would kill them. To
have a rough idea, suppose that in a mid-size country like the United Kingdom 1
million babies are born every year of whom 100 are murdered by their
mothers. So the chance that a mother would kill one baby in a year is
1 in 10,000. What is the chance that the same mother kills
<em>two</em> babies? Say we appeal to the (controversial) assumption
of independence. On this assumption, the chance that a mother kills
two babies equals 1 in 100 million. Assuming independence,</p>

\[\Pr(\textsf{natural})=\frac{1}{73\times10^6}\]

<p>
and</p> 

\[\Pr(\textsf{kill})=\frac{1}{100\times 10^6}.\]

<p>
This means that the prior odds 
would equal .73. With a likelihood ratio of one, the posterior odds
would also equal .73. On this analysis, that Clark killed her sons
would be .73 times less likely than they died of natural causes, or in
other words, the natural cause hypothesis is 1.37 times more likely
than the hypothesis that Clark killed her sons.</p>

<p>
A limitation of this analysis should be kept in mind. The .73 ratio is
a measure of the probability of one hypothesis compared to another.
From this ratio alone, the posterior probability of the individual
hypotheses cannot be deduced. Only if the competing hypotheses \(H\)
and \(H'\) are exclusive and exhaustive, say one is the negation
of the other, can the posterior probability be derived from the
posterior odds</p> 

\[PO=\frac{P(H \pmid E)}{ P(H' \pmid E)}\]

<p>
via the equality</p> 

 \[\Pr(H\pmid E)= \frac{PO}{1+PO}.\]

<p>
But the hypotheses <span class="sans-serif">kill</span> and <span class="sans-serif">natural</span>
are not exhaustive, since the two
babies could have died in other ways. So the posterior odds</p>

  \[\frac{\Pr(\textsf{kill} \pmid \textsf{two deaths})}{\Pr(\textsf{natural} \pmid \textsf{two deaths})}\] 

<p>
cannot be translated into the posterior probabilities of individual
hypotheses. (A more sophisticated probabilistic analysis is presented in
 <a href="#ModeEntiCase">&sect;3.3</a>.)</p>
 
<h3 id="WherDoNumbCome">1.4 Where do the numbers come from?</h3>

<p>
In the examples considered so far, probabilities were assigned on the
basis of empirical frequencies and expert opinions. For example, an
expert testimony that only 5% of people possess a particular blood
type was used to set \(\Pr(\match \pmid \neg \source)=.05\).
Probabilities were also assigned on the basis of common sense, for
example, \(\Pr(\match \pmid \source)\) was set to 1 assuming that if
someone is the source of the crime traces, the person must match the
crime traces (setting aside the possibility of framing, fabrication of
the traces or false negatives in the test results). But probabilities
need not always be assigned exact values. Agreeing on an exact value
can in fact be extremely difficult, especially for prior
probabilities. This is a challenge for legal probabilism (see later in
 <a href="#ProbPrio">&sect;7.3</a>).
 One way to circumvent this challenge is to avoid setting exact values
and adopt plausible intervals. This method is based on <em>sensitivity
analysis</em>, an assessment of how prior probabilities affect other
probabilities.</p>

<p>
Consider the paternity case <span class="casecite">State v. Boyd (331
N.W.2d 480, Minn. 1983)</span>. Expert witness Dr. Polesky testified
that 1,121 unrelated men would have to be randomly selected from the
general population before another man could be found with all the
appropriate genes to have fathered the child in question. This formulation can be misleading since the expected number of matching DNA profiles need not be the same as the number of matching profiles actually found in a population (the error of thinking otherwise is called the expected value fallacy). On a more careful formulation, the probability that a random person 
would be a  match is \(\slashfrac{1}{1121}\), or in
symbols, </p> 

  \[\Pr(\match\pmid \neg \textsf{father})=\frac{1}{1121}.\]

<p>
As explained earlier in
 <a href="#BayeTheoBaseRateFall">&sect;1.2.3</a>,
 this probability cannot be easily translated into the probability
that a person whose genetic profile matches is the father, or in
symbols, \(\Pr(\textsf{father}\pmid \match)\). The latter should be
calculated using Bayes&rsquo; theorem:</p>

\[\begin{align}
\Pr(\textsf{father}\pmid \match) &amp; = 
    \frac{
        \Pr(\match\pmid \textsf{father}) \times \Pr(\textsf{father})
        }
        {
\Pr(\match \pmid \textsf{father}) \times \Pr(\textsf{father}) +
  \Pr(\match \pmid \textsf{not-father}) \times \Pr(\textsf{not-father})      
  }   
\end{align}\]

<p> In actual practice, the formula to establish paternity is more
complicated (Kaiser and Seber, 1983), but for the sake of
illustration, we abstract away from this complexity. Suppose the prior
probability that the defendant would be the father is as low as .01,
or in symbols, \(\Pr(\textsf{father})=.01\).  Plugging in this prior
probability into Bayes theorem, along with \(\Pr(\textsf{m}\pmid
\textsf{father})=1\) and \(\Pr(\textsf{m}\pmid
\textsf{not-father})=1/1,121\), gives a probability of paternity
\(\Pr(\textsf{father}\pmid \textsf{m})\) that is equal to about .92.</p>

<p> But why take the prior probability \(\Pr(\textsf{father})\) to be .01
and not something else? The idea in sensitivity analysis is to look at a range of plausible probability assignments and investigate the impact of such choices. In
legal applications, the key question is whether assignments that are
most favorable to the defendant would still return a strong
evidentiary case against the defendant. In the case at hand, the
expert testimony is so strong that for a wide spectrum of the prior
probability \(\Pr(\textsf{father})\), the posterior probability
\(\Pr(\textsf{father} \pmid \match)\) remains high, as the plot in
 <a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>
 shows.</p>

<div class="figure wide avoid-break" id="fig1">
<img src="sensitivity.png" style="width:90%" alt="graph titled Sensitivity analysis for a paternity case: x-axis is labeled P(father) and goes from 0 to 1; y-axis is labeled P(father|match) and goes from 0 to 1. The line goes sharply up from 0,0 to almost 0,1 then almost horizontal to 1,1" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 1</span></p>
</div>

<p>
The posterior surpasses .9 once the prior is above approximately .008.
In a paternity case, given the mother&rsquo;s testimony and other
evidence, it is clear that the probability of fatherhood before the
expert testimony is taken into account should be higher than that, no
matter what the prior probability should exactly be. Without settling
on an exact value, the interval of values above .008 would guarantee a
posterior probability of paternity to be at least .9. This is amply
sufficient to meet the preponderance standard that governs civil cases
such as paternity disputes (on standards of proof, see later in
 <a href="#StanProo">Section 5</a>.)</p>
 

<h3 id="SourActiOffeLeveHypo">1.5 Source, activity and offense level hypotheses</h3>

<p>
Difficulties in assessing probabilities go hand in hand with the
choice of the hypotheses of interest. To some approximation,
hypotheses can be divided into three levels: offence, activity, and
source level hypotheses. At the offence level, the issue is whether
the defendant is guilty, as in the statement &ldquo;Smith is guilty of
manslaughter&rdquo;. At the activity level, hypotheses describe what
happened and what those involved did or did not do. An example of
activity level hypothesis is &ldquo;Smith stabbed the victim&rdquo;.
Finally, source level hypotheses describe the source of the traces,
such as &ldquo;The victim left the stains at the scene&rdquo;, without
specifying how the traces got there. Overlooking differences in
hypothesis level can lead to serious confusions.</p>

<p>
Consider a case in which a DNA match is the primary incriminating
evidence. DNA evidence is one of the most widely used forms of
quantitative evidence currently available, but it does not work much
differently from blood evidence or other forms of trace evidence. In
testifying about a DNA match, trial experts will often assess the
probability that a random person, unrelated to the crime, would
coincidentally match the crime stain profile (Foreman et al. 2003).
This is called the Genotype Probability or Random Match Probability,
which can be extremely low, in the order of 1 in 100 million or even
lower (Donnelly 1995; Kaye and Sensabaugh 2011; Wasserman 2002). It
is tempting to equate the random match probability to \(\Pr(\match
\pmid \textsf{innocence})\) and together with the prior
\(\Pr(\textsf{innocence})\) use Bayes&rsquo; theorem to calculate the
posterior probability of innocence \(\Pr(\textsf{innocence} \pmid
\match)\). This would be a mistake. Applying Bayes&rsquo; theorem is
of course recommended and helps to avoid the prosecutor&rsquo;s
fallacy, the conflation of \(\Pr(\textsf{innocence} \pmid \match)\)
and \(\Pr(\match \pmid \textsf{innocence})\). The problem here lies
elsewhere. Equating the random match probability with \(\Pr(\match
\pmid \textsf{innocence})\) overlooks the difference between offense,
activity and source level hypotheses. A DNA match cannot speak
directly to the question of guilt or innocence. Even if the suspect is the source of the genetic material at the scene, the match does not establish that the
defendant did visit the scene and came into contact with the victim, and even if they did, it does not follow that they committed the crime they were accused
of.</p>

<p>
Few forms of evidence can speak directly to offense level hypotheses.
Circumstantial evidence that is more amenable to a probabilistic
quantification, such as DNA matches and other trace evidence, does
not. Eyewitness testimony may speak more directly to offense level
hypotheses, but it is also less easily amenable to a probabilistic
quantification (see however Friedman 1987, recent results by Wixted
and Wells 2017, and a survey of related issues by Urbaniak et
al. 2020). This makes it difficult to assign probabilities to offense
level hypotheses. Moving beyond source level hypotheses requires a
close collaboration between scientists, investigators and attorneys
(see Cook et al. 1998 for a discussion).</p>

<h2 id="StreEvid">2. The Strength of Evidence</h2>

<p>
The posterior probability of a hypothesis given the evidence should
not be confused with the strength (or probative value, weight) of the
evidence in favor of the hypothesis. The strength of an item of
evidence reflects its impact on the probability of the hypothesis.
Suppose the prior probability of \(H\) is extremely low, say
\(\Pr(H)=.001\), but taking evidence \(E\) into account brings this
probability up to 35%, that is, \(\Pr(H \pmid E)=.35\). This is a
dramatic upward shift. Even though the posterior probability of \(H\)
given \(E\) is not high, \(E\) strongly favors \(H\). This section
examines how probability theory helps to assess the strength of
evidence.</p>

<h3 id="BayeFactVLikeRati">2.1 Bayes factor v. likelihood ratio</h3>

<p>
The notion of strength of evidence&mdash;as distinct from prior and
posterior probability&mdash;can be captured formally in a number of
different ways (for a comprehensive discussion, see the entry on
 <a href="../confirmation/index.html">confirmation theory</a>).
 One measure of the strength of evidence is the Bayes factor</p>

 \[\frac{\Pr(E \pmid H)}{\Pr(E)}\]

<p>
(already discussed in
 <a href="#BayeTheoBaseRateFall">&sect;1.2.3</a>).
 This is an intuitively plausible measure of evidential strength. Note
that by Bayes&rsquo; theorem</p> 

 \[
\Pr(H \pmid E)  = \textit{BayesFactor}(H, E) \times \Pr(H),\]

<p>
and thus the Bayes factor is greater than one if and only if the
posterior probability \(\Pr(H \pmid E)\) is higher than the prior
probability \(\Pr(H)\). The greater the Bayes factor (for values
above one), the greater the upward shift from prior to posterior
probability, the more strongly \(E\) positively supports \(H\).
Conversely, the smaller the Bayes factor (for values below one),
the greater the downward shift from prior to posterior probability,
the more strongly \(E\) negatively supports \(H\). If
\(\Pr(H)=\Pr(H\pmid E)\) the evidence has no impact, upwards or
downwards, on the prior probability of \(H\).</p>

<p>
The Bayes factor
is an absolute measure of evidence \(E\)&rsquo;s support toward \(H\)
since it compares the probability of \(E\) under hypothesis \(H\)
against the probability of \(E\) in general. The denominator is
calculated following the law of total probability: </p> 

\[\Pr(E)= \Pr(E \pmid H) \Pr(H)+\Pr(E \pmid \neg H) \Pr(\neg H).\]

<p>
The catch-all alternative hypothesis \(\neg H\) can be replaced by a
more fine-grained set of alternatives, say \(H_1, H_2, \dots H_k\),
provided \(H\) and its alternatives cover the entire space of
possibilities. The law of total probability would then read: </p>

\[\Pr(E)  = \Pr(E\pmid H)\Pr(H) +\sum_{i=1}^k \Pr(E\pmid H_i)\Pr(H_i).\]

<p> Instead of Bayes factor, the strength of evidence can be assessed by means of the likelihood ratio, a comparative measure of
whether evidence \(E\) supports a hypothesis \(H\) more than a
competing hypothesis \(H'\), in symbols, </p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(E \pmid H)}{\Pr(E \pmid H')}.\]

<p>
An expert, for instance, may testify that the blood-staining on the
jacket of the defendant is ten times more likely to be seen if the
wearer of the jacket hit the victim (hypothesis \(H\)) rather than if
he did not (hypothesis \(H'\)) (Aitken, Roberts, &amp; Jackson
2010, 38). If the evidence supports \(H\) more than \(H'\), the
ratio would be above one, and if the evidence supports \(H'\) more
than \(H\), the ratio would be below one. The greater the likelihood
ratio (for values above one), the stronger the evidence in favor of
\(H\) as contrasted with \(H'\). The smaller the likelihood ratio
(for values below one), the stronger the evidence in favor of the
competing hypothesis \(H'\) as contrasted with \(H\).</p>

<p>
The relationship between likelihood ratio</p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(E \pmid H)}{\Pr(E \pmid H')}\]

<p>
and posterior odds</p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(H \pmid E)}{\Pr(H' \pmid E)}\]

<p>
is apparent in the odds version of Bayes&rsquo; theorem (see earlier
in
 <a href="#OddsVersBayeTheo">&sect;1.3</a>).
 If the likelihood ratio is greater (lower) than one, the posterior
odds will be greater (lower) than the prior odds of \(H\). The
likelihood ratio, then, is a measure of the upward or downward impact
of the evidence on the odds of two hypotheses \(H\) and
\(H'\).</p>

<p>
A competitor of the likelihood ratio as a measure of evidentiary
strength is an even simpler notion, the probability \(\Pr(E \pmid
H)\). It is tempting to think that, whenever \(\Pr(E \pmid H)\) is
low, \(E\) should be strong evidence against \(H\). Consider an
example by Triggs and Buckleton (2014). In a child abuse
case, the prosecutor offers evidence that a couple&rsquo;s child rocks
(a movement pattern) and that only 3% of non-abused children rock,
\(\Pr(\textsf{child rocks} \pmid \textsf{no abuse})=.03\). If it is
unlikely that a non-abused child would rock, the fact that this child
rocks might seem strong evidence of abuse. But this reading of the 3%
figure is mistaken. It could well be that 3% of abused children rock,
\(\Pr(\textsf{child rocks} \pmid \textsf{abuse})=.03\). If rocking is
unlikely under either hypothesis&mdash;which means the likelihood
ratio</p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(\textsf{child rocks} \pmid \textsf{abuse})}{\Pr(\textsf{child rocks} \pmid \textsf{no abuse})}\]

<p>
equals one&mdash;rocking cannot count as evidence of abuse. In order
to avoid exaggerations of the evidence, it is best to assess it by
means of the likelihood ratio rather the probability of the evidence
given a hypothesis (ENFSI 2015; Royall 1997).</p>

<h3 id="ColdHitDNAMatc">2.2 Cold-hit DNA matches</h3>

<p>
To better understand likelihood ratios, it is instructive to look at
DNA evidence as a case study, focusing in particular on cold-hit
matches. DNA evidence may be used to corroborate other evidence in a
case or as the primary incriminating evidence. Suppose different
investigative leads point to an individual, Mark Smith, as the
perpetrator. Suppose the investigators also find several traces at the
crime scene left by the perpetrator, and laboratory analyses show that
the genetic profile associated with the traces matches Smith. In this
scenario, the DNA match corroborates the other evidence against Smith.
In contrast, suppose no investigative lead allowed the police to identify a suspect. The only evidence consists of the traces found at the crime scene.
The police run the genetic profile associated with the traces through a
database of profiles and find a match, a so-called <em>cold-hit</em>.
Since in cold-hit cases there is no other evidence, cold-hit matches
are the primary item of evidence against the defendant. Some scholars
believe that this circumstance weakens the evidentiary value of the
match. Others disagree. We now examine some of the main
arguments in this debate.</p>

<h4 id="RandMatcVDataMatc">2.2.1 Random match v. database match</h4>

<p>
Suppose an expert testifies that the crime traces genetically match
the defendant and that the random match probability is extremely low,
say 1 in 100 million. The random match probability&mdash;often
interpreted as the probability that someone who is not the source
would coincidentally match, \(\Pr(\match \pmid \neg
\source)\)&mdash;is a common measure of the strength of a DNA match.
The lower this probability, the more strongly incriminating the match.
Strictly speaking, a match is strong evidence that the defendant is
the source only if the likelihood ratio</p> 

 \[\frac{\Pr(\textsf{DNA match} \pmid \source)}{\Pr(\textsf{DNA match} \pmid \neg \source)}\]

<p>
is significantly greater than one. In practice, however, when the
random match probability is low&mdash;that is, \(\Pr(\match \pmid \neg
\source)\) is low&mdash;the likelihood ratio should be significantly
above one because the probability that the individual who is the
source would match, \(\Pr(\match \pmid \source)\), should be high so
long as the test has a low false negative rate. For practical
purposes, then, a low random match probability does count as strong
incriminating evidence.</p>

<p>
When it comes to cold-hit matches, however, further complications
arise. The Puckett case can serve as an illustration. In 2008, John
Puckett was identified through a database search of 338,000 profiles.
He was the only individual in the database who matched the traces
collected from Diana Sylvester, a victim of rape in 1972. The expert
witness testified that Puckett&rsquo;s genetic profile should occur
randomly among Caucasian men with a frequency of 1 in 1.1 million.
This would seem strong evidence against Puckett&rsquo;s innocence. But
the DNA expert for the defense, Bicka Barlow, pointed out that besides
the cold-hit match the evidence against Puckett was slim. Barlow
argued that the correct assessment of the cold-hit match required to
multiply 1/1.1 million by the size of the database. Call the result of
this multiplication the <em>database match probability</em>.
Multiplying 1/1.1 million by 338,000 yields a database match
probability of roughly 1/3, an unimpressive figure. If someone in the
database could match with a probability of 1/3, the cold-hit match
should not count as strong evidence against Puckett. This was
Barlow&rsquo;s argument.</p>

<p>
Barlow followed a 1996 report by the National Research Council, often
referred to as NRC II (National Research Council 1996). The report
recommended that in cold-hit cases the random match probability should
be multiplied by the size of the database. This correction was meant
to guard against the heightened risk of mistaken matches for the
innocent people in the database. NRC II used an analogy. If you toss
several different coins at once and all show heads on the first
attempt, this outcome seems strong evidence that the coins are biased. If,
however, you repeat this experiment sufficiently many times, it is
almost certain that at some point all coins will land heads. This
outcome should not count as evidence that the coins are biased.
According to NRC II, repeating the coin toss experiment multiple times
is analogous to trying to find a match by searching through a database
of profiles. As the size of the database increases, it is more likely
that someone in the database who had nothing to do with the crime
would match.</p>

<p>
The aptness of the analogy has been challenged (Donnelly and
Friedman 1999). Searching a larger database no doubt increases the
probability of finding a match at some point. But the relevant proposition here is not  &ldquo;At least one of the
profiles in the database would randomly match the crime sample&rdquo;.
Rather, the relevant proposition is &ldquo;The profile of the
defendant on trial would randomly match the crime sample&rdquo;. The
probability of finding a match between the defendant and the crime
sample does not increase because other people in the database are
tested. In fact, suppose everyone in the world is recorded in the
database. A unique cold-hit match would be extremely strong evidence
of guilt since everybody would be excluded as a suspect except one
matching individual. Instead, if the random match probability were
multiplied by the size of the database, the probative value of the
match should be quite low. This is counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>
Another analogy is sometimes used to argue that the evidentiary value
of a cold-hit match should be weakened. The analogy is between
searching for a match in a database and multiple hypothesis testing,
an objectionable research practice. In classical hypothesis testing,
if the probability of type I error in a single test of a hypothesis is
.05, this probability will increase by testing the same hypothesis
multiple times. The database match probability&mdash;the argument
goes&mdash;would correct for the increased risk of type I error.
However, as Balding (2002, 2005) points out, multiple testing consists
in testing the <em>same</em> hypothesis multiple times against new
evidence. In cold-hit cases, multiple hypotheses&mdash;each concerning
a different individual in the database&mdash;are tested only once and
then excluded if a negative match occurs. From this perspective, the
hypothesis that the defendant is the source is one of the many
hypotheses subject to testing. The cold-hit match supports that
hypothesis and rules out the others.</p>

<h4 id="LikeRatiColdHitMatc">2.2.2 The likelihood ratio of cold-hit matches</h4>

<p>
A more principled way to assess cold-hit matches is based on the
likelihood ratio. The proposal draws from the literature on the
so-called <em>island problem</em>, studied by Eggleston (1978), Dawid
(1994), and Dawid and Mortera (1996). Let the prosecutor&rsquo;s
hypothesis \(H_p\) be &ldquo;The suspect is the source of the crime
traces&rdquo; and the defense hypothesis \(H_d\) be &ldquo;The suspect
is not the source of the crime traces&rdquo;. Let \(M\) be the DNA
match between the crime stain and the suspect (included in the
database) and \(D\) the information that no one among the profiles in
the database, except for the suspect, matches the crime stain. The
likelihood ratio associated with \(M\) and \(D\) should be (Balding
and Donnelly 1996; Taroni et al. 2014):</p>

 \[V  = \frac{\Pr(M,D\pmid H_p)}{\Pr(M,D\pmid H_d)}.\]

<p>
Since \(\Pr(A\wedge B)=\Pr(A\pmid B)\times \Pr(B)\), for any statement
\(A\) and \(B\), this ratio can be written as </p> 

\[
V  = \frac{\Pr(M\pmid H_p,D)}{\Pr(M\pmid H_d,D)} \times \frac{\Pr(D\pmid H_p)}{\Pr(D\pmid H_d)}.\]

<p>
The first ratio</p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(M\pmid H_p,D)}{\Pr(M\pmid H_d,D)}\]

<p>
is roughly \(\slashfrac{1}{\gamma}\), where \(\gamma\) is the random
match probability. The second ratio </p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(D\pmid H_p)}{\Pr(D\pmid H_d)}\]

<p>
is the <em>database search ratio</em>, defined as follows (for details, see
Balding and Donnelly 1996; Taroni et al. 2014): </p>

\[
\frac{\Pr(D\pmid H_p)}{\Pr(D\pmid H_d)}  = \frac{1}{1-\varphi},\]

<p>
where \(\Pr(S \pmid H_d)=\varphi\) and \(S\) stands for the
proposition that someone in the database is the source of the crime
traces. Donnelly and Friedman (1999) derived a similar formula for
this ratio. As the database gets larger, \(\varphi\) increases and the
database search ratio increases. This ratio equals one only if no one
in the database could be the source.</p>

<p>
Since the likelihood ratio \(V\) of the cold-hit match results by
multiplying the likelihood ratio of the DNA match and the database
search ratio, \(V\) will always be greater than the mere likelihood
ratio of the match (except for the unrealistic case in which
\(\varphi=0\)) . Thus, a cold-hit DNA match should count as stronger
evidence than a DNA match of a previously identified suspect. Dawid
and Mortera (1996) study different database search strategies and
consider the possibility that information about the match is itself
uncertain, but the general point remains. Under reasonable
assumptions, ignoring the database search would give a conservative
assessment of the evidentiary strength of the cold-hit match.</p>

<p>
There is intuitive resistance in basing a conviction on a cold-hit
match, but this resistance is less strong in case of an ordinary match
(more on this later in
 <a href="#NakeStatEvid">Section 6</a>).
 This preference for convictions based on an ordinary DNA match seems
in tension with the claim that a cold-hit match is stronger evidence
of guilt than an ordinary match. There is a way to reconcile both
sides, however. The key is to keep in mind that the evidentiary
strength&mdash;measured by the likelihood ratio&mdash;should not be
confused with the posterior probability of guilt given the evidence.
If the cold-hit match is the only evidence of guilt, the posterior
probability of guilt may well be lower compared to cases in which
other evidence, such as investigative leads, supplements the DNA
match. This lower posterior probability would justify the intuitive
resistance towards convictions in cold-hit cases despite the stronger
probative value of the cold-hit match.</p>

<h3 id="ChooCompHypo">2.3 Choosing competing hypotheses</h3>

<p>
The likelihood ratio is helpful for assessing the strength of the
evidence, as the preceding discussion about cold-hit matches shows.
One major difficulty, however, is the choice of the hypotheses \(H\)
and \(H'\) that should be compared. The hypotheses should compete
with one another&mdash;say, in a criminal trial, \(H\) is the
hypothesis put forward by the prosecution and \(H'\) is the
hypothesis put forward by the defense. But this constraint leaves open
the possibility for manipulations and misinterpretations of the
evidence. Let us examine some of the main controversies in the
literature on this topic.</p>

<h4 id="AdHocHypoBarrGeor">2.3.1 Ad hoc hypotheses and Barry George</h4>

<p>
Consider again a stylized DNA evidence case. Suppose the prosecutor puts
forward the hypothesis that the suspect left the traces found at the
crime scene. This hypothesis is well supported by laboratory analyses
showing that the defendant genetically matches the traces. The
defense, however, responds by putting forward the following <em>ad
hoc</em> hypothesis: &ldquo;The crime stain was left by some unknown
person who happened to have the same genotype as the suspect&rdquo;.
Since the probability of the DNA match given either hypothesis is 1,
the likelihood ratio equals 1 (Evett, Jackson, and Lambert 2000).
The problem generalizes. For any item of evidence and any given
prosecutor&rsquo;s hypothesis \(H\), there is an <em>ad hoc</em>
competing hypothesis \(H^*\) such that</p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(E \pmid H)}{\Pr(E \pmid H^*)}=1.\]

<p>
Hypothesis \(H^*\) is a just-so hypothesis, one that is selected only
because it explains the evidence just as well as hypothesis \(H\) does
(Mayo 2018: 30&ndash;55). If no further constraints are placed on the choice of the
competing hypotheses&mdash;it would seem&mdash;no evidence could ever
incriminate a defendant.</p>

<p>
Judges and jurors will often recognize <em>ad hoc</em> hypotheses for
what they are&mdash;artificial theories that should not be taken
seriously. Perhaps, the common sense of the participants in a trial
will suffice to constrain the choice of hypotheses in the right way.
But real cases are complex, and it is not always obvious whether a
choice of competing hypotheses, which are not obviously <em>ad
hoc</em>, is legitimate or not.</p>

<p>
A notable example is <span class="casecite">R. v. George (2007 EWCA
Crim 2722</span>). Barry George was accused of murdering British
journalist and TV celebrity Jill Dando. A single particle of firearm
residue was found one year later in George&rsquo;s coat pocket and it
matched the residue from the crime scene. This was the key
incriminating evidence against him. George was convicted, and his
first appeal was unsuccessful. After the first appeal, Ian Evett from
the Forensic Science Service worried that the evidence had not been
properly assessed at trial. The jurors were presented with the
conditional probability of finding the firearm residue in
George&rsquo;s coat given the defense hypothesis that George <em>did
not</em> fire the gun. This probability was estimated to be quite low.
But the jurors were not presented with the conditional probability of
finding the same evidence given the prosecutor&rsquo;s hypothesis that
George <em>did</em> fire the gun that shot Dando. An expert witness,
Mr. Keeley, was asked to provide both conditional probabilities and
estimated them to be \(\slashfrac{1}{100}\), which indicated that the
firearm residue had no probative value. George appealed again in 2007,
and relying on Keely&rsquo;s estimates, won the appeal.</p>

<p> A study of the trial transcript shows that Keeley&rsquo;s choice
of hypotheses lacked coherence and the likelihood ratio based on them
was therefore meaningless. On one occasion, Keeley compared the
hypothesis that the particle found in George&rsquo;s pocket came from
a gun fired by George himself, and the alternative hypothesis that the
particle came from another source. On another occasion, Keeley took
the prosecutor&rsquo;s hypothesis to be &ldquo;The particle found in
George&rsquo;s pocket came from the gun that killed Dando.&rdquo; But
the conditional probability of the evidence given this hypothesis
should not be low. It should actually be one. The most charitable
reading of the trial transcript suggests that the expert had in mind
the hypotheses &ldquo;George was the man who shot Dando&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The integrity of George&rsquo;s coat was corrupted&rdquo;. But
Keeley gave no justification for why these hypotheses should be
compared in the likelihood ratio (see Fenton et al. 2014 for
details).</p>

<p>
A related complication is that competing hypotheses can concern any
factual dispute, from minute details such as whether the cloth used to
suffocate the victim was red or blue, to ultimate questions such as
whether the defendant stabbed the victim. The likelihood ratio varies
across hypotheses formulated at different levels of granularity:
offense, activity and source level hypotheses (on this distinction,
see earlier in
 <a href="#SourActiOffeLeveHypo">&sect;1.5</a>).
 It is even possible that, at the source level, the likelihood ratio
favors one side, say the prosecution, but at the offence level, the
likelihood ratio favors the other side, say the defense, even though
the hypotheses at the two levels are quite similar (Fenton, et
al. 2014).</p>

<h4 id="ExclExha">2.3.2 Exclusive and exhaustive?</h4>

<p>
The confusion in the Barry George case is attributable to the absence
of clear rules for choosing the hypotheses in the likelihood ratio.
One such rule could be: pick competing hypotheses that are exclusive
(they cannot be both true) and exhaustive (they cannot be both false).
In this way, the parties would not be able to pick <em>ad hoc</em>
hypotheses and skew the assessment of the evidence in their own
favor.</p>

<p> There are other good reasons why the hypotheses in the likelihood ratio should be exclusive and exhaustive. For if they are not, the likelihood ratio can deliver counterintuitive results. To see why, first consider hypotheses that are not mutually exclusive. Let \(H_p\) stand for &ldquo;The defendant
is guilty&rdquo; and \(H_d\) for &ldquo;The defendant was not at the
crime scene&rdquo;. Let \(E\) stand for </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Ten minutes before the crime took place the defendant&mdash;seen at a
different location&mdash;was overheard on the phone saying <em>go
ahead and kill him</em>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The evidence positively supports each hypothesis, yet it is
conceivable that the likelihood ratio should equal one in this
context. Further, consider two competing hypotheses that are not
exhaustive. Suppose Fred and Bill attempted to rob a man. The victim
resisted, was struck on the head and died. Say \(H_p\) stand for
&ldquo;Fred struck the fatal blow&rdquo; and \(H_d\) stand for
&ldquo;Bill struck the fatal blow&rdquo;. The hypotheses are not
exhaustive because a third hypothesis is &ldquo;The man did not die
from the blow&rdquo;. Suppose \(E\) is the information that the victim
had a heart attack six months earlier. The likelihood ratio</p>

\[\frac{\Pr(E \pmid H_p)}{\Pr(E \pmid H_d)}\]

<p>
equals one since</p> 

\[\Pr(E\pmid H_p)=\Pr(E\pmid H_d).\]

<p>
Yet \(E\) reduces the probability of both \(H_p\) and \(H_d\). So, in
this case, the evidence negatively supports each hypothesis, contrary
to what the likelihood ratio suggests.</p>

<p>
But relying on exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses is not without
complications either. Consider an expert who decides to formulate the
defense hypothesis by negating the prosecution hypothesis, say,
&ldquo;the defendant did not hit the victim in the head&rdquo;. This
choice of defense hypothesis can be unhelpful in assessing the
evidence. What is the probability that the suspect would carry such
and such blood stain if he did not hit the victim in the head? This
depends on whether he was present at the scene, what he was doing at
the time and many other circumstances. As Evett, Jackson, and Lambert
(2000) point out, the choice of a particular hypothesis to be used in
the evaluation of the strength of the evidence will depend on
contextual factors. More often than not, the hypotheses chosen will
not be mutually exclusive. Comparing exclusive and exhaustive
hypotheses can also be unhelpful for jurors or judges making a
decision at trial. In a paternity case, for example, the expert should
not compare the hypotheses &ldquo;The accused is the father of the
child&rdquo; and its negation, but rather, &ldquo;The accused is the
father of the child&rdquo; and &ldquo;The father of the child is a man
unrelated to the putative father&rdquo; (Biedermann et al.
2014). Even though the relatives of the accused are potential fathers,
considering such a far-fetched possibility would make the assessment
of the evidence more difficult than needed (Evett et al. 2000).</p>

<p>
Exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses guard against arbitrary
comparisons and ensure a more principled assessment of the evidence.
The drawback is that such hypotheses cover the entire space of
possibilities, and sifting through this space is cognitively
unfeasible (Allen 2017). In this respect, comparing more circumscribed hypotheses
is preferable. The danger of doing so, however, is that likelihood
ratios heavily depend on the hypotheses that are compared. The more
latitude in the choice of the hypotheses, the more variable the
likelihood ratio as a measure of evidentiary value.</p>

<h3 id="TwoStaiProb">2.4 The two-stain problem</h3>

<p>
A case study that further illustrates the limitations of the
likelihood ratio as a measure of evidentiary strength is the two-stain
problem, originally formulated by Evett (1987).</p>

<p>
In Evett&rsquo;s original formulation, two stains from two different
sources are left at the crime scene, and the suspect&rsquo;s blood
matches one of them. Let the first hypothesis be that the suspect was
one of the two men who committed the crime and the second hypothesis
the negation of the first. Evett (1987) shows (see his paper for
details) that the likelihood ratio of the match relative to these two
hypotheses is \(\slashfrac{1}{2q_1}\) where \(q_1\) is the estimated
frequency of the characteristics of the first stain. Surprisingly, the
likelihood ratio does not depend on the frequency associated with the
second stain.</p>

<p>
Consider now a more complex two-stain scenario. Suppose a crime was
committed by two people, who left two stains at the crime scene: one
on a pillow and another on a sheet. John Smith, who was arrested for a
different reason, genetically matches the DNA on the pillow, but not
the one on the sheet. Meester and Sjerps (2004) argue that there are
three plausible pairs of hypotheses associated with numerically
different likelihood ratios (see their paper for details). The three
options are listed in
 <a href="#table2">table 2</a>,
 where \(R\) is the random match probability of Smith&rsquo;s genetic
profile and \(\delta\) the prior probability that Smith was one of the
crime scene donors.</p>

<table class="cellpad-small cell-left centered vert-top shortcap hrulesTH avoid-break" id="table2">
<caption>Table 2</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

  <td>Smith was not the pillow stain donor.</td>
  <td style="text-align:center">\(\frac{R(2-\delta)}{2(1-\delta)}\)</td>
</tr> </tbody>
</table>

<p>
Even though the likelihood ratios are numerically different, their
posterior probabilities given the evidence are the same. Note that the
prior odds of the three \(H_p\)&rsquo;s in the table should be written
in terms of \(\delta\). Following (Meester and Sjerps 2004), the
prior odds of the first hypothesis in the table are
\(\slashfrac{\delta}{(1-\delta)}\). The prior odds of the second
hypothesis are \(\slashfrac{(\delta/2)}{(1-\delta)}\). The prior odds
of the third hypothesis are
\(\slashfrac{(\delta/2)}{(1-(\delta/2))}\). In each case, the
posterior odds&mdash;the result of multiplying the prior odds by the
likelihood ratio&mdash;are the same: \(R\times
\slashfrac{\delta}{(2(1-\delta))}\). So despite differences in the
likelihood ratio, the posterior odds of the different hypotheses are
the same so long as the priors are appropriately related.</p>

<p>
Meester and Sjerps (2004) recommend that each likelihood ratio should
be accompanied by a tabular account of how a choice of prior odds (or
prior probabilities) will impact the posterior odds, for a sensible
range of priors (for a general discussion of this strategy, called
&ldquo;sensitivity analysis&rdquo;, see earlier discussion in
 <a href="#WherDoNumbCome">&sect;1.4</a>).
 In this way, the impact of the likelihood ratio is made clear, no
matter the hypotheses chosen. This strategy concedes that likelihood
ratios are insufficiently informative, and that they should be
combined with other information, such as a range of priors, to allow
for an adequate assessment of the evidence.</p>

<h2 id="BayeNetwForLegaAppl">3. Bayesian Networks for Legal Applications</h2>

<p> So far we examined how probability theory can help to assess single items of evidence such as a DNA match. But things are often more complicated.
In legal cases, different lines of evidence may converge, such as two
witnesses who testify that the defendant was seen at the crime scene,
or they may diverge, such as a witness who asserts the defendant was
seen at the crime scene while DNA testing shows no genetic match
between the defendant and the scene. Another source of complexity is
that the hypotheses put forward by the parties in a trial are often
complex structures of statements. How can different statements, and
their supporting evidence, be combined and the overall
prosecutor&rsquo;s case (or the defense&rsquo;s case) be
evaluated?</p>

<p>
The probability of a hypothesis given multiple pieces of evidence can,
in principle, be assessed by sequential applications of Bayes&rsquo;
theorem. Consider, for example, a case in which the defendant faces
two pieces of incriminating evidence: a DNA match and hair evidence
found at the scene matching the defendant&rsquo;s hair color.
Assume&mdash;as is often done&mdash;that someone&rsquo;s hair color is
independent of someone&rsquo;s genetic profile. Say the likelihood
ratio of hair evidence is 40 and the likelihood ratio of the DNA match
is 200, that is, it is 40 times more likely (and 200 times more
likely) to find the evidence given the guilt hypothesis than the
innocence hypothesis. If the prior odds of guilt to innocence are
\(\slashfrac{1}{1000}\), the posterior odds would be
\(\slashfrac{1}{1000}\times 40\times 200=8\).</p>

<p>
These calculations are straightforward, but in more realistic cases,
there will be complications. The parties at trial will often put
forward several piecemeal claims that need to be combined together to
form a theory of what happened. For example, the prosecutor may
present eyewitness testimony to argue that the defendant ran away from
the crime scene, along with documentary evidence as proof of a motive.
The different piecemeal claims, each supported by distinct pieces of
evidence, must be combined to form structured hypotheses about what
happened. Since different claims and different pieces of evidence may
depend on one another, direct calculations would soon become
unmanageable. Fortunately, a tool exists to make the task easier:
Bayesian networks. This section identifies guidelines for deploying
Bayesian networks in the presentation, aggregation and evaluation of
complex bodies of evidence and hypotheses.</p>

<h3 id="BayeNetwResc">3.1 Bayesian networks to the rescue</h3>

<p>
The idea that Bayesian networks can be used for probabilistic
reasoning in legal fact-finding started gaining traction in late
eighties (Friedman 1986) and early nineties (Edwards 1991). Two
recent books on the topic with an emphasis on legal applications are
Fenton and Neil 2013 [2018] and Taroni et al. 2014. A Bayesian
network comprises two components: first, a directed acyclic graph of
relations of dependence (represented by arrows) between variables
(represented by nodes); second, conditional probability tables.
Consider the graphical component first. The graph is acyclic because
the arrows connecting the nodes do not form loops. As an illustration,
let \(H\) be the claim that the suspect committed the murder,
<em>BT</em> the presence of a blood type B match with a crime scene
stain, and \(W\) the fact that an eyewitness observed the suspect near
the scene around the time of the crime. The graphical component of the
Bayesian network would look like this:</p>

The <em>ancestors</em> of a node \(X\) are all those nodes from which
we can reach \(X\) by following the arrows going forwards. The
<em>parents</em> of a node \(X\) are those for which we can do this in
one step. The <em>descendants</em> of \(X\) are all which can be
reached from \(X\) by following the arrows going forward. The
<em>children</em> are those for which we can do this in one step. In
the example, \(H\) is the parent (and ancestor) of both \(W\) and
<em>BT</em>, which are its children (and descendants). There are no
non-parent ancestors or non-children descendants.</p>

<p>
The variables, which are represented by nodes and are connected by
arrows, stand in relation of probabilistic dependence. To describe
these relations, the graphical model is accompanied by conditional
probability tables. For parentless nodes such as \(H\), the tables
specify the prior probabilities of all their possible states. Assuming
\(H\) stands for a binary random variable, with two possible states,
the prior probabilities could be:</p>

<table class="centered cellpad-small cell-right shortcap hrulesTH">
<caption>Table 3</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>Prior</th> </tr> </thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>\(H=\text{murderer}\)</td>
  <td>.01</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(H=\text{not.murderer}\)</td>
  <td>.99</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>

<p>
The .01 figure for \(H=\text{murderer}\) rests on the assumption that,
absent any incriminating evidence, the defendant is unlikely to be
guilty. For children nodes, the tables specify their conditional
probability given combinations of their parents&rsquo; states. If the
variables are binary, an assignment of values for them could be:</p>

<table class="centered cellpad-small cell-center shortcap hrulesTH">
<caption>Table 4</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>\(H=\text{murderer}\)</th>
<th>\(H=\text{not.murderer}\)</th> </tr> </thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td style="text-align:right">\(W=\text{seen}\)</td>
  <td>.7</td>
  <td>.4</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td style="text-align:right">\(W=\text{not.seen}\)</td>
  <td>.3</td>
  <td>.6</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>

<table class="centered cellpad-small cell-center shortcap hrulesTH">

  <td style="text-align:right">\(\BT=\text{match}\)</td>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>.063</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td style="text-align:right">\(\BT=\text{no.match}\)</td>
  <td>0</td>
  <td>.937</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>

<p>
According to the tables above, even if the defendant is not the
culprit, the eyewitness testimony would still incriminate him with
probability of .4, while the blood evidence with probability equal to
only .063. The blood type frequency estimate is realistic (Lucy 2013:
141), and so are the conditional probabilities for the eyewitness
identification. As expected, eyewitness testimony is assumed to be
less trustworthy than blood match evidence (but for complications
about assessing eyewitness testimony, see Wixted and Wells 2017;
Urbaniak et al. 2020).</p>

<p>
The three probability tables above are all that is needed to define
the probability distribution. The tables do not specify probabilistic
dependencies between nodes that are not in a relation of child/parent,
such as <em>BT</em> and \(W\). Since there is no arrow between them,
nodes <em>BT</em> and \(W\) are assumed to be independent conditional
on \(H\), that is, \(\Pr(W \pmid H)=\Pr(W \pmid H \wedge \BT)\). This
fact represents, as part of the structure of the network, the
independence between eyewitness testimony and blood evidence. A
generalization of this fact is the so-called Markov condition (see the
textbook by Neapolitan [2004] and the
 <a href="../artificial-intelligence/bayesian-nets.html">supplement on Bayesian networks</a>
 of the entry on
 <a href="../artificial-intelligence/index.html">artificial intelligence</a>.)</p>
 
<p>
While the Bayesian network above&mdash;comprising a directed acyclic
graph along with probability tables&mdash;is simple, a correct
intuitive assessment of the probability of the hypothesis given the
evidence is already challenging. Try to guess the probability that the
defendant committed the murder (\(H=\text{murderer}\)) given the
following states of the evidence:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
The suspect&rsquo;s blood type matches the crime stain but information
about the witness is unavailable.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The suspect&rsquo;s blood type matches the crime stain but the witness
says they did not see the suspect near the crime scene.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The suspect&rsquo;s blood type matches the crime stain and the witness
says they saw the suspect near the crime scene.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Already at this level of complexity, calculations by hand become
cumbersome. In contrast, software for Bayesian networks (see, for
example, the \(\textsf{R}\) package \(\textsf{bnlearn}\) developed by
Marco Scutari and described in Scutari and Denis 2015) will easily
give the following results:</p>

<table class="centered cellpad-small cell-center shortcap hrulesTH">
<caption>Table 6</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>\(H=\text{murderer}\)</th> </tr> </thead>
<tbody>

  <td style="text-align:right">\(\BT=\text{match},W=?\)</td>
  <td>.138</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td style="text-align:right">\(\BT=\text{match},W=\text{not.seen}\)</td>
  <td>.074</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td style="text-align:right">\(\BT=\text{match},
W=\text{seen}\)</td>
  <td>.219</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>

<p>
Perhaps surprisingly the posterior probability of \(H\) = murderer is about .22
even when both pieces of evidence are incriminating
(\(\BT=\text{match}, W=\text{seen}\)).</p>

<h3 id="Idio">3.2 Idioms</h3>

<p>

While modeling the relationships between evidence and hypotheses, simple graphical patterns (called <em>idioms</em>) are often used. Complex graphical models can be constructed by combining these basic patterns in a modular way. General methods for constructing Bayesian networks are discussed in (Neil, Fenton, and Nielson 2000;  
Hepler, Dawid, and Leucari 2007) and general idioms are discussed in
(Fenton, Neil, and Lagnado 2013). A few of the basic idioms are
illustrated below.</p>

<p>
The <em>evidence idiom</em> is the most basic graphical representation
of the relation between a hypothesis and a piece of evidence:</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="fig3">
<img src="fig3.svg" style="width:130px;" alt="two circles labeled 'Hypothesis' and 'Evidence' and arrow goes from the first to the second." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 3</span></p>
</div>

<p>
This directed graph suggests that the direction of
influence&mdash;which could, but need not, be interpreted as causal
influence&mdash;goes from hypothesis to evidence (though the
probabilistic dependence goes both ways). The hypothesis node and the
evidence node can be binary variables, such as &ldquo;The defendant
was the source of the crime scene traces&rdquo; (hypothesis) and
&ldquo;The defendant genetically matches the crime traces&rdquo;
(evidence). But the variables need not be binary. The hypothesis node
might take values from the range of 1&ndash;40, say the distance in
meters from which the gun was shot, and the evidence node might be a
continuous variable representing the density of gun shot residues
(Taroni et al. 2014).</p>

<p>
A more complex idiom, called the <em>evidence accuracy idiom</em>,
consists of two arrows going into the evidence node (Bovens and
Hartmann 2004; Fenton, Neil, and Lagnado 2013). One incoming arrow comes from the
hypothesis node and the other from the accuracy node. This idiom can
be used to model, say, an alcohol test:</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="fig4">
<img src="fig4.svg" style="width:400px;" alt="Three nodes labeled 'Accuracy of Evidence', 'Excess alcohol level', and 'Evidence for excess'. An arrow points from each of the first two to the third." />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 4</span></p>
</div>

<p>
The directions of the arrows indicate that the accuracy of the
evidence (accuracy node) and the alcohol level (hypothesis node)
influence the outcome of the test (evidence node). The graphical model
represents different sources of uncertainty. The uncertainty
associated with the sensitivity and specificity of the test&mdash;that
is, the probability that the tests reports excessive alcohol level
when the level is excessive (sensitivity) and the probability that the
test reports normal alcohol level when the level is normal
(specificity)&mdash;is captured by the arrow going from the hypothesis
node (<span class="sans-serif">Excess alcohol level</span>) to the
evidence node (<span class="sans-serif">Evidence for excess</span>).
Other sources of uncertainty comprise the possibility that the police
officer lied about the test report or the possibility that the driver
took medications which then affected the alcohol level. These
possibilities can be taken into consideration by adding an accuracy
node (or multiple accuracy nodes, if each factor is kept separate from
the other).</p>

<p>
When multiple items of evidence depend on one another&mdash;as may
happen in many legal cases&mdash;this situation is modeled by the
<em>evidence dependency idiom</em>. Following an example by Fenton and
Neil (2013 [2018]), if one of two security cameras directed at the
same location captured an image of someone who looks like the
defendant but isn&rsquo;t him, it is likely that the same person
walked by the second camera, which also captured the same image. In
such cases, presenting the second recording as independent from the
first would lead to overestimating the strength of the evidence.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="fig5">
<!-- <img src="BNfiles/unnamed-chunk-9-1" alt="image" />
-->
<img src="fig5.svg" style="width:200px; padding-bottom:1ex" alt="four nodes labeled H, D, C1, and C2. An arrow goes from D to C2; another arrow from H to C2; a third from H to C1; and a fourth from C1 to C2." />

<table class="centered cellpad-small cell-right hrulesTH">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Node</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Proposition</th> </tr> </thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>H</td>
  <td style="text-align:left">Defendant present at the scene</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>C1</td>
  <td style="text-align:left">Camera 1 captures image of a matching
person</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>C2</td>
  <td style="text-align:left">Camera 2 captures image of a matching
person</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>D</td>
  <td style="text-align:left">What cameras capture is dependent</td>
</tr> </tbody>
</table>

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 5</span></p>
</div>

<p>
The network structure is quite natural. The truth of the hypothesis,
say, the defendant was present at the crime scene, influences whether
the cameras capture an image of someone who looks like the defendant.
However, if the two camera recordings are dependent on one another
(for instance, they are directed at the same spot with a similar
angle), the fact that the second camera captured the same image as the
first does not make the hypothesis more likely once the first camera
recording is known.</p>

<p>
Finally, the <em>scenario idiom</em> can model complex hypotheses,
consisting of a sequence of events organized in space and time (a
scenario). A graphical model that uses the scenario idiom would
consist of the following components: first, nodes for the states and
events in the scenario, with each node linked to the supporting
evidence; second, a separate scenario node that has states and events
as its children; finally, a node corresponding to the ultimate
hypothesis as a child of the scenario node. The graphical model would
look like this (Vlek et al. 2014):</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="fig6">
<img src="fig6.svg" alt="a diagram: link to extended description below" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 6</span> [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig6">extended description of figure 6</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
The scenario node unifies the different events and states. Because of
this unifying role, increasing the probability of one part of the
scenario (say <span class="sans-serif">State/event 2</span>) will also
increase the probability of the other parts (<span class="sans-serif">State/event
1</span> and <span class="sans-serif">State/event
3</span>). This captures the fact that
the different components of a scenario form an interconnected sequence
of events.</p>

<p>
A discussion of modeling crime scenarios by means of other graphical
devices (called structural scenario spaces) mixed with probabilities
can be found in the work of Shen et al. (2007); Bex (2011,
2015); and Verheij (2017). See also the survey by Di Bello and Verheij
(2018). Dawid and Mortera (2018) give a treatment of scenarios in
terms of Bayesian networks. Lacave and D&iacute;ez (2002) show how
Bayesian Network can be used to construct explanations.</p>

<h3 id="ModeEntiCase">3.3 Modeling an entire case</h3>

<p>
Kadane and Schum (2011) made one of the first attempts to model an entire
criminal case, Sacco and Vanzetti from 1920, using probabilistic
graphs. More recently, Fenton and Neil (2013 [2018]) constructed a
Bayesian network for the Sally Clark case (discussed earlier in
 <a href="#OddsVersBayeTheo">&sect;1.3</a>),
 reproduced below:</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break" id="fig7">
<!-- <img src="BNfiles/unnamed-chunk-11-1" alt="a diagram: link to extended description below" />
-->
<img src="fig7.svg" alt="a diagram: link to extended description below" />

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 7</span> [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig7">extended description of figure 7</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
The arrows depict relationships of influence between variables.
Whether Sally Clark&rsquo;s sons, call them \(A\) and \(B\), died by
SIDS or murder (<span class="sans-serif">A.cause</span> and <span class="sans-serif">B.cause</span>)
influences whether signs of disease
(<span class="sans-serif">A.disease</span> and <span class="sans-serif">B.disease</span>)
and bruising (<span class="sans-serif">A.bruising</span>
and <span class="sans-serif">B.bruising</span>)
were present. Since son \(A\)
died first, whether \(A\) was murdered or died by SIDS (<span class="sans-serif">A.cause</span>)
influences how son \(B\) died
(<span class="sans-serif">B.cause</span>). How the sons died
determines how many sons were murdered (<span class="sans-serif">No.murdered</span>),
and how many sons were
murdered decides whether Sally Clark is guilty (<span class="sans-serif">Guilty</span>).</p>

<p>
According to the calculation by Fenton and Neil (2013 [2018]) (see
their paper for details), the prior probability of <span class="roman">Guilty
= Yes</span> should be .0789. After taking into
account the incriminating evidence presented at trial, such as that
there were signs of bruising but no signs of a preexisting disease
affecting the children, the posterior probabilities are as
follows:</p>

<table class="centered cellpad-small cell-left shortcap hrulesTH">
<caption>Table 8</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Evidence (cumulative)</th>
<th>\(\Pr(\textrm{Clark guilty})\)</th> </tr> </thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>A bruising</td>
  <td style="text-align:center">.2887</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>A no signs of disease</td>
  <td style="text-align:center">.3093</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>B bruising</td>
  <td style="text-align:center">.6913</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>B no signs of disease</td>
  <td style="text-align:center">.7019</td> </tr> </tbody>
</table>

<p>
The incriminating evidence, combined, brings the probability of guilt
from .0789 to .7019. This is a significant increase, but not quite
enough for a conviction. If one wishes to perform sensitivity
analysis&mdash;see earlier discussion in
 <a href="#WherDoNumbCome">&sect;1.4</a>&mdash;by
 modifying some of the probabilities, this can be easily done. During
the appeal trial, new evidence was discovered, in particular, evidence
that son \(A\) was affected by a disease. Once this evidence is taken
into account, the probability of guilt drops to .00459 (and if signs
of disease were also present on \(B\), the guilt probability would
drop even further to .0009). For a general discussion on how to elicit
probabilities, see Renooij (2001) and Gaag et al.
(1999).</p>

<h2 id="Rele">4. Relevance</h2>

<p>
The preceding sections modeled evidence assessment, using Bayes&rsquo;
theorem
 (<a href="#ProbTool">Section 1</a>),
 likelihood ratios
 (<a href="#StreEvid">Section 2</a>)
 and Bayesian networks
 (<a href="#BayeNetwForLegaAppl">Section 3</a>).
 Evidence assessment, however, begins with a preliminary decision, the
identification of relevant evidence. Once a piece of evidence is
deemed relevant, the next step is to assess its strength (probative
value, weight). This section discusses how probability theory helps to
identify relevant evidence.</p>

<h3 id="LikeRati">4.1 Likelihood ratios</h3>

<p>
The U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence define relevant evidence as
evidence that has </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence
to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than
it would be without the evidence (rule 401). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This definition is formulated in a probabilistic language. Legal
probabilists interpret it using the likelihood ratio, a standard
probabilistic measure of evidential relevance (Aitken et al. 2010;
Aitken and Taroni 1995 [2004]; Lempert 1977; Lyon and Koehler
1996; Sullivan 2019). The likelihood ratio (discussed in
 <a href="#StreEvid">Section 2</a>)
 is the probability of observing the evidence given the
prosecutor&rsquo;s or plaintiff&rsquo;s hypothesis, divided by the
probability of observing the same evidence given the defense&rsquo;s
hypothesis.</p>

<p>
Let \(E\) be the evidence, \(H\) the prosecutor&rsquo;s or
plaintiff&rsquo;s hypothesis, and \(H'\) the defense&rsquo;s
hypothesis. The likelihood ratio is defined as follows: </p>

\[
LR(E,H,H')  = \frac{P(E\pmid H)}{P(E\pmid H')}\]

<p>
On the likelihood ratio interpretation, relevance depends on the
choice of the competing hypotheses. A piece of evidence is
relevant&mdash;in relation to a pair of hypotheses \(H\) and
\(H'\)&mdash;provided the likelihood ratio \(LR(E, H, H')\) is
different from one and irrelevant otherwise. For example, the bloody
knife found in the suspect&rsquo;s home is relevant evidence in favor
of the prosecutor&rsquo;s hypothesis because we think it is far more
likely to find such evidence if the suspect committed the crime
(prosecutor&rsquo;s hypothesis) than if he didn&rsquo;t (defense
hypothesis) (Finkelstein 2009). In general, for values greater than
one, \(LR(E, H, H')&gt;1\), the evidence supports the
prosecutor&rsquo;s or plaintiff&rsquo;s hypothesis \(H\), and for
values below one, \(LR(E, H, H')&lt;1\), the evidence supports the
defense&rsquo;s hypothesis \(H'\). If the evidence is equally
likely under either hypothesis, \(LR(E, H, H')=1\), the evidence
is irrelevant.</p>

<h3 id="SmalTownMurdObje">4.2 The Small Town Murder objection</h3>

<p>
This account of relevance has been challenged by cases in which the
evidence is intuitively relevant and yet its likelihood ratio,
arguably, equals one. Here is one problematic case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Small Town Murder:</em> A person accused of murder in a small town
was seen driving to the small town at a time prior to the murder. The
prosecution&rsquo;s theory is that he was driving there to commit the
murder. The defense theory is an alibi: he was driving to the town to
visit his mother. The probability of this evidence if he is guilty
equals that if he is innocent, and thus the likelihood ratio is 1
&hellip; Yet, every judge in every trial courtroom of the country
would admit it [as relevant evidence]. (The difficulty has been
formulated by Ronald Allen, see the discussion in Park et al.
2010)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Counterexamples of this sort abound. Suppose a prisoner and two guards
had an altercation because the prisoner refused to return a food tray.
The prisoner had not received a package sent to him by his family and
kept the tray in protest. According to the defense, the prisoner was
attacked by the guards, but according to the prosecution, he attacked
the guards. The information about the package sent to the prisoner and
the withholding of the tray fails to favor either version of the
facts, yet it is relevant evidence (Pardo 2013).</p>

<p>
It is true that if a piece of evidence \(E\) fits equally well with
two competing hypotheses \(H\) and \(H'\), then \(P(E\pmid
H)=P(E\pmid H')\) and thus \(LR(E,H,H')\) will equal 1. But
the likelihood ratio may change depending on the selection of
hypotheses. Rule 401 makes clear that relevant evidence should have
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
any tendency to make the existence of <em>any fact that is of
consequence</em> [emphasis ours] to the determination of the action
more probable or less probable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So the range of hypotheses to compare should be broad. Just because
the likelihood ratio equals one for a specific selection of \(H\) and
\(H'\), it does not follow that it equals one for <em>any</em>
selection of \(H\) and \(H'\) which are of consequence to the
determination of what happened. In <em>Small Town Murder</em>, whether
the suspect was in town is of consequence for determining what
happened (if he was not in town, he could not have committed the
crime). The fact that he was seen driving is helpful information for
establishing whether he was in town.</p>

<p>
But if the range of hypotheses \(H\) and \(H'\) to compare in the
likelihood ratio \(LR(E, H, H')\) is broad, this may raise another
concern. The choice of hypotheses needed to determine the relevance of
an item of evidence might depend on other items of evidence, and so it
might be difficult to determine relevance until one has heard all the
evidence. This fact&mdash;Ronald Allen and Samuel Gross argue in Park
et al. (2010)&mdash;makes the probabilistic account of relevance
impractical. In response, David Kaye points out that deciding whether
a reasonable juror would find evidence \(E\) helpful requires only
looking at what hypotheses or stories the juror would reasonably
consider. Since the jurors will rely on several clues about which
stories are reasonable, this task is computationally easier than going
over all possible combinations of hypotheses (Park et al. 2010).</p>

<p>
The problem with the paradoxes of relevance is that in complex
situations there is no single likelihood ratio that corresponds to a
piece of evidence. The problematic cases focus on a single likelihood
ratio based on non-exclusive or non-exhaustive hypotheses. However,
evidence can be relevant so long as it has a probabilistic impact on a
pertinent sub-hypothesis, even without having a probabilistic impact
on the prosecutor&rsquo;s or defense&rsquo;s ultimate hypotheses. When
this happens, the evidence is relevant, in agreement with Rule 401 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence. Bayesian networks (discussed in the
preceding section) help to see how pieces of evidence can increase or
decrease the probability of different sub-hypotheses (for more
details, see de Zoete et al. 2019).</p>

<h2 id="StanProo">5. Standards of Proof</h2>

<p>
After the evidence has been presented, examined and cross-examined at
trial, trained judges or lay jurors must reach a decision (see Laudan
2010 for a few caveats on what the decision should be about). The
decision criterion is defined by law and consists of a standard of
proof, also called the burden of persuasion. If the evidence against
the defendant is sufficiently strong to meet the requisite proof
standard, the defendant should be found liable. This section begins
with a description of standards of proof in the law, then outlines a
probabilistic account of standards of proof, and discusses
some objections to this account.</p>

<h3 id="LegaBack">5.1 Legal background</h3>

<p>
In criminal proceedings, the governing standard is &ldquo;proof beyond
a reasonable doubt&rdquo;. In civil cases, the standard is typically
&ldquo;preponderance of the evidence&rdquo;. The latter is less
demanding than the former, so the same body of evidence may be enough
to meet the preponderance standard, but not enough to meet the beyond
a reasonable doubt standard. A vivid example of this difference is the
1995 trial of O.J. Simpson who was charged with murdering his wife. He
was acquitted of the criminal charges, but when the family of the
victim brought a lawsuit against him, they prevailed. O.J. Simpson did
not kill his wife according to the beyond a reasonable doubt standard,
but he did according to the preponderance standard. An intermediate
standard, called &ldquo;clear and convincing evidence&rdquo;, is
sometimes used for civil proceedings in which the decision is
particularly weighty, for example, a decision whether someone should
be involuntarily committed to a hospital facility.</p>

<p>
How to define standards of proof, or whether they should be even
defined in the first place, remains contentious (Diamond 1990;
Horowitz and Kirkpatrick 1996; Laudan 2006; Newman 1993; Walen
2015). Judicial opinions offer different paraphrases, sometimes
conflicting, of what these standards mean. The meaning of &ldquo;proof
beyond a reasonable doubt&rdquo; is the most controversial. It has
been equated to &ldquo;moral certainty&rdquo; or &ldquo;abiding
conviction&rdquo; (<span class="casecite">Commonwealth v. Webster, 59
Mass. 295, 1850</span>), or to </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
proof of such a convincing character that a reasonable person would
not hesitate to rely and act upon it in the most important of his own
affairs. (US Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, Devitt et al. 1987, 12.10, 354)
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But courts have also cautioned that there is no need to define the
term because &ldquo;jurors know what is reasonable and are quite
familiar with the meaning of doubt&rdquo; and attempts to define it
only &ldquo;muddy the water&rdquo; (<span class="casecite">U.S. v.
Glass, 846 F.2d 386, 1988</span>).</p>

<p>
Probability theory can bring conceptual clarity to an otherwise
heterogeneous legal doctrine, or at least this is the position of
legal probabilists.</p>

<h3 id="ProbThre">5.2 Probability thresholds</h3>

<p>
Legal probabilists have proposed to interpret proof beyond a
reasonable doubt as the requirement that the defendant&rsquo;s
probability of guilt, given the evidence presented at trial, meet a
threshold, say, \(&gt;\).95. Variations of this view are common (see,
for example, Bernoulli 1713; DeKay 1996; Kaplan 1968; Kaye 1979b;
Laplace 1814; Laudan 2006). This interpretation is, in some respects,
plausible. From a legal standpoint, the requirement that guilt be
established with high probability, still short of 1, accords with the
principle that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is the most stringent
standard of all but &ldquo;does not involve proof to an absolute
certainty&rdquo; and thus &ldquo;it is not proof beyond any
doubt&rdquo; (<span class="casecite">R. v. Lifchus, 1997, 3 SCR 320,
335</span>).</p>

<p>
Reliance on probabilistic ideas is even more explicit in the standard
&ldquo;preponderance of the evidence&rdquo;&mdash;also called
&ldquo;balance of probabilities&rdquo;&mdash;which governs decisions
in civil disputes. This standard can be interpreted as the requirement
that the plaintiff&mdash;the party making the complaint against the
defendant&mdash;establish its version of the facts with greater than
probability of .5. The .5 threshold, as opposed to a more stringent
threshold of .95 for criminal cases, reflects the fact that
preponderance is less demanding than proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
The intermediate standard &ldquo;clear and convincing evidence&rdquo;
is more stringent than the preponderance standard but not as stringent
as the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. Since it lies in between
the other two, it can be interpreted as the requirement that the
plaintiff establish its versions of the facts with, say, probability
at the level of .75-.8.</p>

<p>
Some worry that a mechanical application of numerical thresholds would
undermine the humanizing function of trial decision-making. As Tribe
put it, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
induced by the persuasive force of formulas and the precision of
decimal points to perceive themselves as performing a largely
mechanical and automatic role, few jurors &hellip;could be relied upon
to recall, let alone to perform, [their] humanizing function. (1971:
1376) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thresholds, however, can vary depending on the costs and benefits at
stake in each case (see later discussion). So they need not be applied
mechanically without considering the individual circumstances (Hedden
and Colyvan 2019). Furthermore, if jurors are numerically literate,
they should not lose sight of their humanizing function as they would
no longer be intimated by numbers. So the worry suggests the need to
ensure that jurors are numerically literate, not dispensing with
probabilistic thresholds altogether.</p>

<p>
Even if numerical thresholds cannot be used in the daily business of
trial proceedings, they can still serve as theoretical concepts for
understanding the role of proof standards in the justice system, such
as regulating the relative frequency of false positive and false
negative decisions or minimizing expected costs. A more stringent
threshold will decrease the number of false positives (say false
convictions) at the cost of increasing the number of false negatives
(say false acquittals), and a less stringent threshold will increase
the number of false positives while decreasing the number of false
negatives. This trade-off has been described, among others, by Justice
Harlan in his concurring opinion <span class="casecite">in re Winship,
397 U.S. 358, 397 (1970)</span>. As shown below, the formal apparatus
of probability theory, in combination with expected utility theory,
can make this point more precise.</p>

<h3 id="MiniExpeCost">5.3 Minimizing expected costs</h3>

<p>
Expected utility theory recommends agents to take the course of action
that, among the available alternatives, maximizes expected utility. On
this view, the standard of proof is met whenever the expected utility
(or cost) of a decision against the defendant (say, a conviction) is
greater (or lower) than the expected utility (or cost) of a decision
in favor of the defendant (say, an acquittal) (DeKay 1996; Hamer 2004;
Kaplan 1968). Let \(c(CI)\) be the cost of convicting a factually
innocent defendant and \(c(AG)\) the cost of acquitting a factually
guilty defendant. For a conviction to be justified, the expected cost
of convicting an innocent&mdash;that is, \(c(CI)\) discounted by the
probability of innocence \([1-\Pr(G\pmid E)]\)&mdash;must be lower
than the expected cost of acquitting a guilty defendant&mdash;that is,
\(c(AG)\) discounted by the probability of guilt \(\Pr(G\pmid E)\).
This holds just in case </p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(G\pmid E)}{1- \Pr(G\pmid E)} &gt; \frac{c(CI)}{c(AG)}.\]

<p>This inequality serves to identify the probability threshold that should be met for decisions against the defendant. When the
cost ratio \(\slashfrac{c(CI)}{c(AG)}\) is set to 9&mdash;which
might be appropriate in a criminal case since convicting an innocent
is often considered more harmful than acquitting a guilty defendant
(however, see Laudan 2016)&mdash;the inequality holds only if \(\Pr(G
\pmid E)\) meets the .9 threshold. The same analysis <em>mutatis
mutandis</em> applies to civil cases in which mistaken decisions
comprise mistaken attributions of liability (false positives) and
mistaken failures to attribute liability (false negatives). If the
cost ratio is one&mdash;as might be appropriate in a civil case in
which false positives and false negatives are equally
harmful&mdash;the inequality holds only if the probability that the
defendant is liable meets the .5 threshold.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break wide" id="fig8">

<p class="center">
<span class="figlabel">Figure 8</span> [An
 <a href="figdesc.html#fig7">extended description of figure 8</a>
 is in the supplement.]</p>
</div>

<p>
This analysis only considers the costs of mistaken decisions, but
leaves out the benefits associated with correct decisions. More
comprehensive analyses would consider both (Lillquist 2002; Laudan and Saunders 2009), but the basic insight
would remain the same. Trial decision-making is viewed as one
instrument among others for maximizing overall social welfare (Posner
1973). On this account of proof standards, the stringency of the
threshold depends on costs and benefits, and thus different cases may
require different thresholds. Cases in which the charge is more
serious than others&mdash;say, murder compared to petty
theft&mdash;may require higher thresholds so long as the cost of a
mistaken decision against the defendant is more significant. Whether
or not standards of proof should vary in this way is debated (Kaplow
2012; Picinali 2013; see also the entry on
 <a href="../evidence-legal/index.html">the legal concept of evidence</a>).</p>

<p>
The standard &ldquo;proof beyond a reasonable doubt&rdquo; is often
paired with the Blackstone ratio, the principle that it is better that
ten guilty defendants go free rather than even just one innocent be
convicted. The exact ratio is in fact a matter of controversy (Volokh
1997). It is tempting to think that, say, the .9 threshold guarantees
a 1:9 ratio between false convictions and false acquittals. But this
would be hasty for at least two reasons. First, probabilistic
thresholds affect the expected rate of mistaken decisions. The actual
rate may deviate from its expected value (Kaye 1999). Second, if the
threshold is .9, <em>at most</em> 10% of decision against defendants
are expected to be mistaken (false convictions) and <em>at most</em>
90% of the decisions in favor of the defendant are expected to be
mistaken (false acquittals). The exact ratio will depend on the
probabilities assigned to defendants and how they are distributed
(Allen 2014). What can be said, in general, is that the threshold that
minimizes the expected rate of incorrect decisions overall, no matter
the underlying distribution, lies at .5 (see Kaye 1982, 1999; Cheng
&amp; Pardo 2015 for a proof).</p>

<h3 id="AlteProbThre">5.4 Alternatives to probabilistic thresholds</h3>

<p>
There exist several theoretical alternatives to the probabilistic
interpretation of proof standards in the scholarly literature.
Pennington and Hastie (1991, 1993) have proposed the <em>story
model</em> according to which judges and jurors first make sense of
the evidence by constructing stories of what happened, and then select
the best story on the basis of multiple criteria, such as coherence,
fit with the evidence and completeness.  Pardo and Allen (2008) argue
that the version of the facts that best explains the evidence should
prevail in a court of law. On the role of coherence and story
construction in evidence assessment and decision-making at trial, see
(Amaya 2015; Griffin 2013; Simon 2004).
 </p>

<p>
Another approach is due to Gordon, Prakken, and Walton (2007) and
Prakken and Sartor (2009) who view the trial as a place in which
arguments and counterarguments confront one another. The party that
has the best arguments, all things considered, should prevail. On this
view, probability estimates can themselves be the target of objections
and counterarguments. Along these lines, Stein (2008) argues that, in
order to warrant a verdict against the defendant, the evidence should have survived individualized scrutiny, not merely support a high probability of liability.</p>

<p>
Philosophers and legal theorists have also leveled distinctively
epistemological critiques. Ho (2008) and Haack (2014) hold that
degrees of epistemic warrant for a claim, which depend on multiple
factors&mdash;such as the extent to which the evidence supports the
claim and it is comprehensive&mdash;cannot be equated to
probabilities. Gardiner (2019) argues that standards of proof should
rule out all error possibilities that are relevant and these need not
coincide with error possibilities that are probable. Finally, some
epistemologists argue that a belief that is assigned high probability, no matter how high,
is not enough to warrant knowledge, and knowledge should be the
standard for trial verdicts (Blome-Tillmann 2017; Duff et al. 2007; Levanon 2019; Littlejohn 2020; Moss
forthcoming).</p>

<p>
Scholars and commentators have also voiced more specific objections
that need not invalidate the probabilistic framework but rather call
for refinements. Nance (2016) argues that the evidence on which to
base a trial decision should be reasonably complete&mdash;it should be
all the evidence that one would reasonably expect to see from a
conscientious investigation of the facts. A similar argument can be
found in Davidson and Pargetter (1987). Arguably, probability-based
decision thresholds can accommodate these considerations, for example,
by lowering the probability of civil or criminal liability whenever
the body of evidence is one-sided or incomplete (Friedman 1996;
Kaye 1979c, 1986). Another strategy is to give a probability-based
account of the notion of completeness of the evidence and other
seemingly non-probabilistic criteria (Urbaniak 2018).</p>

<p>
There are a plethora of other objections. The puzzles of naked
statistical evidence and the conjunction paradox are two of the most
widely debated in the literature. These and other objections are
examined in the sections that follow.</p>

<h2 id="NakeStatEvid">6. Naked Statistical Evidence</h2>

<p>
The puzzles of naked statistical evidence consist of hypothetical
scenarios in which the probability of the defendant&rsquo;s civil or
criminal liability, given the evidence, is above the requisite
threshold. Yet many have the intuition that the defendant should not
be found liable. The question is how to justify this intuition despite
the fact that the probability of liability meets the threshold. The
puzzles of naked statistical evidence concern the question of
<em>sufficiency</em>, namely, whether a body of evidence is enough to
meet the proof standard applicable in a case. They are not about
whether some evidence should be <em>admissible</em> at trial (on the
distinction, see Picinali 2016).</p>

<h3 id="BlueBusGatePris">6.1 Blue Bus, Gatecrasher, Prisoner</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>
<em>Blue Bus</em> (Tribe 1971). Mrs. Brown is run down by a bus. It is
common knowledge that 80% of the buses in town are owned by Blue Bus,
and the remaining 20% by Red Bus. There was no witness to the accident
except Brown who is, however, color-blind. Since Blue Bus owns 80% of
the buses in town, it is 80% likely that Brown was run down by a bus
operated by Blue Bus, well above the 50% threshold for civil
liability. Yet, merely presenting the 80% naked statistics should not
be sufficient for Brown to prevail in a civil lawsuit against Blue
Bus.</p>

<p>
<em>Gatecrasher</em> (Cohen 1977). It is known that 499 people paid
for admission to a rodeo, but the total number of spectators was 1000.
Suppose no paper tickets were issued and no witness could identify
those who paid. For any spectator picked at random, it is more than
50% likely that they did not pay for admission. But even if this
probability is above the .5 threshold for civil liability, it would be
odd that the rodeo organizers could win a lawsuit against any of the
spectators simply by presenting the 449-out-of-1000 naked statistics.</p>

<p>
<em>Prisoner</em> (Nesson 1979). 100 prisoners are exercising in a
prison yard. Suddenly 99 of them attack and kill the only guard on
duty. One prisoner played no role whatsoever in the assault. These are
the undisputed facts in the case, and there is no further information
about what happened. If a prisoner is picked at random, his
probability of guilt would be as high as .99. Yet the intuition is
that this cannot be enough to establish guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These scenarios are like lottery cases in which the probability of a
proposition such as &ldquo;my ticket is a loser&rdquo; is high, yet
intuitively the proposition cannot count as knowledge (see, e.g.,
Harman 1968; Ebert, Smith, and Durbach 2018; Hawthorne 2004; Lawlor
2013; Nelkin 2000). The evidence in these scenarios&mdash;in
particular, <em>Gatecrasher</em> and <em>Prisoner</em>&mdash;does not
single out an individual specifically, but applies to any member of a
group. Just as in lottery cases any ticket is very likely to lose,
anyone who attended the rodeo or any prisoner in the yard is very
likely to be liable. In this sense, naked statistical evidence is
sometimes contrasted with individualized or case-specific evidence
such as trace evidence or eyewitness testimony (Colyvan, Regan, and
Ferson 2001; Stein 2005; Thomson 1986; Williams 1979). The distinction is
contested, however. Any form of evidence, after all, relies on a
categorization that places the defendant in a class with others, being
the class of those who have such-and-such facial features or were in
such-and-such a place (Harcourt 2006; Saks and Kidd 1980; Schauer
2003; Schoeman 1987; Wright 1988). Tillers (1997, 2005) notes that it
is not always objectionable to base inferences about the behavior of
an individual on the behavior of others, for example, membership in a
gang or in the Ku Klux Klan can be indicative of someone&rsquo;s
beliefs.</p>

<p>
Still, there is intuitive resistance against verdicts of liability
based on naked statistics, but this resistance is less pronounced for
verdicts based on more traditional forms of evidence, such as trace or
eyewitness testimony. The asymmetry might just be an artifact of
history, since the testimony of an honest witness has been the bedrock
of the Anglo-American trial system. However, the resistance toward
naked statistical evidence along with the preference for other forms
of evidence has also been verified empirically (Arkes,
Shoots-Reinhard, and Mayes 2012; Niedermeier, Kerr, and
Mess&eacute; 1999; Wells 1992) and is not limited to the legal context
(Ebert et al. 2018; Friedman and Turri 2015; Sykes and Johnson
1999).</p>

<p>
Some scholars have expressed reservations about the relevance of
hypothetical scenarios featuring naked statistical evidence. Since
these scenarios are removed from trial practice, they might be an
unreliable guide for theorizing about the trial (Allen and Leiter
2001; Dant 1988; Schmalbeck 1986). These scenarios, however, are
partly modeled on real cases. For example, <em>Blue Bus</em> is
modeled on <span class="casecite">Smith v. Rapid Transit, Inc. 317
Mas. 469 (1945)</span>. The hypothetical also bears a similarity with
the landmark case <span class="casecite">Sindell v. Abbott
Laboratories, 26 Cal. 3d 588 (1980)</span> in which different
companies marketed the same drug that was later shown to have caused
cancer to a particular individual. Since the drug was sold by multiple
companies, it was impossible to determine which company was
responsible. Statistics about the market share of the two companies
were used to attribute liability in absence of better, more
individualized evidence.</p>

<h3 id="ColdHits">6.2 Cold-hits</h3>

<p>
Legal scholars have drawn parallels between naked statistical evidence
and DNA evidence in cold-hit cases (Roth 2010). The peculiarity of
cold-hit cases is that the defendant is identified through a database
search of several different genetic profiles, and as a consequence,
the evidence in cold-hit cases consists almost exclusively of a DNA
match between the crime traces and the defendant (see earlier
discussion in
 <a href="#ColdHitDNAMatc">&sect;2.2</a>).
 The match&mdash;as is customary&mdash;is complemented by a
statistical estimate of the frequency of the profile, say, one in one
hundred million people share the same matching profile. Given the
largely statistical nature of the evidence, cold-hit cases can be seen
as realistic examples of scenarios such as <em>Prisoner</em> or
<em>Gatecrasher</em>. But whether we should think about cold-hit cases
in this way is contested. Some authors place naked statistical
evidence and cold-hit matches on a par (Smith 2018) and others do not
(Enoch and Fisher 2015; Enoch, Spectre, and Fisher 2012).</p>

<p>
Some appellate courts in the United States have ruled that cold-hit
matches, even though they are uncorroborated by other evidence,
constitute sufficient ground for verdicts of criminal liability
(Malcom 2008). Judge Hardwick, for example, writes that</p>

<blockquote>

<p> if DNA material is found in a location, quantity, and type inconsistent
with casual contact and there is one in one quintillion likelihood
that some else was the source of the material, the evidence is legally
sufficient to support a guilty verdict. Missouri v.&#8198;Abdelmalik,
273 S.W.3d, 61, 66 (Mo. Ct. App. 2008) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Such pronouncements by appellate court lend support to the view that
the statistics underlying cold-hit DNA matches are unlike naked
statistical evidence (Cheng and Nunn 2016; Di Bello 2019).</p>

<h3 id="ReviResp">6.3 Revisionist responses</h3>

<p>
The puzzles of naked naked statistical evidence are some of the most
difficult for legal probabilism. They directly challenge the claim
that a high probability should suffice for a judgment of criminal or
civil liability. One line of response that legal probabilists can
pursue is to recommend revising our intuitions in hypothetical cases
and questioning their relevance as a guide for theorizing about
standards of proof. Legal probabilists can argue that the preference
for traditional forms of evidence over statistical evidence is an
unwarranted bias (Laudan 2006; Papineau forthcoming). They can point
out that research in psychology and cognitive science has shown that
eyewitness testimony and fingerprint evidence are often unreliable
(Simons and Chabris 1999), prone to manipulation (Loftus 1979
[1996]), and influenced by subjective considerations and matters of
context (Dror, Charlton, and P&eacute;ron 2006; Zabell 2005).
Relying on statistical evidence, on the other hand, should improve the
overall accuracy of trial decisions (Koehler and Shaviro 1990).
Legal probabilists can also argue that the puzzles of naked
statistical evidence are confined to hypotheticals, and our judgments
about statistical evidence may well differ in more realistic cases
(Hedden and Colyvan 2019; Ross 2021).</p>

<p>
Few have defended such revisionist views, however. The literature
has predominantly tried to vindicate the intuitive difference between
naked statistical evidence and other forms of evidence. What follows
is a discussion of some of the proposals in the literature, focusing
specifically on the probabilistic ones. An examination of the
non-probabilistic solutions to the paradoxes of naked statistical
evidence falls outside the scope of this entry (for critical surveys,
see Redmayne 2008; Gardiner 2018; Pardo 2019).</p>

<h3 id="NonReviResp">6.4 Non-revisionist responses</h3>

<p>
Below are six non-revisionist moves legal probabilists can make in
response to the paradoxes of naked statistical evidence.</p>

<p>
First, legal probabilists can deny that in scenarios such as
<em>Gatecrasher</em> the probability of liability is high enough to
meet the required threshold. Kaye (1979a) argues that whenever there
is no other evidence besides naked statistical evidence, this is not
enough for the plaintiff to win because the evidence is suspiciously
thin. This circumstance should lead the fact-finders to lower the
probability of liability below the requisite threshold. Along similar
lines, Nance (2016) argues that when the evidence presented at trial
is incomplete&mdash;that is, evidence that one would reasonably expect
to see at trial is missing&mdash;the defendant should not be found
liable. This strategy  might work in
scenarios such as <em>Blue Bus</em> in which the paucity of the
evidence could well be the plaintiff&rsquo;s fault. But the difficulty is, it is unclear
whether this strategy works for scenarios such as <em>Gatecrasher</em>
or <em>Prisoner</em> in which the paucity of the evidence is a
characteristic of the scenarios themselves, not anyone&rsquo;s
fault.</p>

<p>
Second, legal probabilists can appeal to the reference class problem
(Colyvan, Regan, and Ferson 2001; see also later 
 <a href="#FurtObje">Section 7</a>). An individual may fall under different
reference classes. If 3% of those who smoke have lung cancer and 0.1%
of those who exercise regularly have lung cancer, what about someone
who smokes and exercises regularly? In <em>Gatecrasher</em>, it is
arbitrary to single out the group of people at the stadium and not the
group of people with a history of trespassing. There is no clear
reason why one or the other reference class was chosen. The choice of
another reference class could have led to a different conclusion about
the defendant&rsquo;s probability of liability. This approach has also
been endorsed by scholars who are decidedly opposed to legal
probabilism (Allen and Pardo 2007). Critics of this approach note
that the reference class problem affects any evidence-based judgment.
In assessing the strength of any piece of evidence, different
reference classes can be used, say the class of witnesses who give
detailed descriptions of what they saw or the class of witnesses who
are nervous (Redmayne 2008).</p>

<p>
Third, legal probabilists can observe that probabilistic claims based
on naked statistical evidence are not resilient enough against
possible countervailing evidence (on the notion of resilience and
stability of belief, see Skyrms 1980; Leitgeb 2014). If an eyewitness
were to assert that the prisoner did not participate in the riot, the
probability that he would be guilty of killing the guard should be
lowered significantly. Presumably, trial verdicts cannot be so
volatile. They should aim to some degree of stability even in light of
possible further evidence (Bolinger 2021). A problem with this
approach is that more evidence could always be found that would change
one&rsquo;s probabilistic assessment. A further problem is that the
puzzles of naked statistical evidence are cases in which no further
evidence is&mdash;or could possibly be&mdash;available. But adding the
assurance that the probabilistic claims could not be revised does not
make the naked statistics less problematic.</p>

<p>
Fourth, legal probabilists can insist that verdicts solely based on
naked statistics do not promote the goal of expected utility
maximization. This is not so much because the naked statistics are bad
evidence, but rather, because reliance on them may have a number of
unintended costs, such as suboptimal allocation of the burden of error
or lack of deterrence. In <em>Blue Bus</em>, for example, a verdict
against the company with the largest market share might create a
perverse economic incentive against larger companies (Posner 1973). It
is unclear how this explanation could be extended to other cases such
as <em>Gatecrasher</em> or <em>Prisoner</em>, and there are even
variants of <em>Blue Bus</em> not susceptible to this objection (Wells
1992). Alternatively, Dahlman (2020) argues that verdicts based on
naked statistical evidence do not provide any added incentive for
lawful conduct because they would not make a distinction between
lawful and unlawful behavior. (On deterrence and naked statistics, see
also Enoch, Spectre, and Fisher 2012; Enoch and Fisher 2015).</p>

<p>

Fifth, another line of response for legal probabilists is to concede
that the paradoxes of naked statistical evidence demonstrate the
inadequacy of simple probabilistic thresholds as proof standards
(Urbaniak 2019). Instead of the posterior probability of liability, a
number of scholars have focused on the likelihood ratio \(P(E\pmid
H)/P(E \pmid H')\). Their argument is that, even though naked
statistical evidence can support a high posterior probability of
liability, the likelihood ratio of this evidence equals one because it
could be presented against a defendant no matter what the defendant
did. If so, naked statistical evidence should have no evidential value
(Cheng 2012; Sullivan 2019). However, Dahlman (2020) has criticized
this argument noting that, under plausible assumptions, the likelihood
ratio of naked statistical evidence is significantly greater than one.
 Di Bello (2019) argues that in cases such as <em>Prisoner</em> and
<em>Gatecrasher</em> the likelihood ratio could take a range of
different values depending on the background information that is taken
into account. The likelihood ratio of naked statistical evidence in
those scenarios is therefore neither one nor greater than one, but
strictly speaking unknown (for a critique of this argument, see
Urbaniak et al. 2020).</p>

<p>Finally, legal probabilists can reformulate probabilistic standards
of proof using the concept of knowledge. Moss (2018) argues that a
probabilistic belief, just like a full belief, can constitute
knowledge.  This notion of probabilistic knowledge can be used to
formulate an account of standards of proof for trial decisions (Moss,
2018: ch. 10; Moss, forthcoming). The preponderance standard for civil
cases would be met if, based on the evidence presented at trial,
judges or jurors have at least .5 credence that the defendant is
liable, and this probabilistic belief constitutes knowledge.  The
standard in criminal cases&mdash;proof beyond a reasonable
doubt&mdash;would instead require knowledge of the probabilistic
belief that the defendant is extremely likely to be guilty or simply
full-fledged knowledge of guilt. To the extent that naked statistical
evidence does not warrant full-fledged knowledge or probabilistic
knowledge, knowledge-based accounts offer a solution to the puzzles of
naked statistical evidence. In addition, the probabilistic knowledge
account of standards of proof promises to vindicate the intuition that
probability alone is not enough for legal proof while also
acknowledging the key role that probability plays in decision-making
at trial (however, for a critique of knowledge-based accounts of legal
proof from a legal standpoint, see Allen 2021).

</p>

<h2 id="FurtObje">7. Further Objections</h2>

<p>
Aside from the paradoxes of naked statistical evidence, the
conjunction paradox is one of the most widely discussed objections
against legal probabilism. This section examines this paradox together
with a few other objections. Many of these objections can be traced
back to the seminal work of Cohen (1977) who also leveled criticisms
against Bayesian epistemology more generally (for further discussion,
see Earman 1992; Bovens and Hartmann 2004; Bradley 2015 and the
entry on
 <a href="../epistemology-bayesian/index.html">Bayesian epistemology</a>).</p>
 

<h3 id="DiffAbouConj">7.1 The difficulty about conjunction</h3>

<p>
Suppose the plaintiff is to prove two separate claims, \(A\) and
\(B\), according to the governing standard of proof, say,
preponderance of the evidence (which the legal probabilist may
interpret as the requirement that the facts be established with
greater probability than .5). If the plaintiff has proven each claim
with probability .7, the burden of proof should be met. And yet, if
the two claims are independent, the probability of their conjunction
is only \(.7\times.7=.49\), below the required threshold. Arguably,
common law systems subscribe to a conjunction principle which states
that if \(A\) and \(B\) are established according to the governing
standard of proof, so is their conjunction. Probability theory&mdash;the
criticism goes&mdash;cannot capture this principle. This is the so-called
conjunction paradox or difficulty about conjunction. It was originally
formulated by Cohen (1977) and has enjoyed great popularity every
since (Allen 1986; Allen and Stein 2013; Allen and Pardo 2019;
Haack 2014; Schwartz and Sober 2017; Stein 2005).</p>

<p>
Without rejecting the conjunction principle of the common law, legal
probabilists can respond in a few different ways. Dawid (1987) argues
that the difficulty about conjunction disappears if evidential support
is modeled probabilistically by likelihood ratios instead of posterior
probabilities. He writes that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
suitably measured, the support supplied by the conjunction of several
independent testimonies exceeds that supplied by any of its
constituents. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although the original paradox pertains to posterior probabilities of
liability, Dawid argues that the paradox does not arise for likelihood
ratios. Garbolino (2014) also recommends switching to likelihood
ratios. Yet the conjunction paradox still arises for likelihood ratios
when the items of evidence, say \(a\) and \(b\), are assessed relative
to a composite hypothesis, say \(A \wedge B\). Suppose \(a\) and \(b\)
provide positive support for \(A\) and \(B\), respectively. Urbaniak
(2019) shows that the combined likelihood ratio</p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(a \wedge b \pmid  A\wedge B)}{\Pr(a\wedge b \pmid  \neg (A \wedge B))}\]

<p>
can be lower than the individual likelihood ratios </p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(a \pmid  A)}{\Pr(a \pmid  \neg A)}\]

<p>
and</p> 

 \[\frac{\Pr(b \pmid  B)}{\Pr(b \pmid  \neg B)}.\]

<p>
Cheng (2012) provides another probability-based solution to the
conjunction paradox. He argues that the standard of proof in civil
cases should require that the plaintiff&rsquo;s hypothesis be
comparatively more probable on the evidence than the defendant&rsquo;s
hypothesis. On this account, the probability of \(A\wedge B\) given
the overall evidence in a case should be compared with the probability
of the alternative hypotheses given the same evidence. The
alternatives to be considered are as follows: </p>

<ul>

<li>\(A\wedge \neg B\), </li>

<li>\(\neg A \wedge B\), and </li>

<li>\(\neg A \wedge \neg B\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Given suitable assumptions, the probabilities of these alternatives
will fall below the probability of \(A\wedge B\) provided \(A\) and
\(B\), individually, are supported by the evidence. So whenever the
standard of proof is met for individual claims \(A\) and \(B\), the
standard should also be met for the composite claim \(A \wedge B\).
Kaplow (2014) advances a similar argument. Urbaniak (2019) points out
that Cheng splits the defense hypothesis into three sub-cases,
\(A\wedge \neg B\), \(\neg A \wedge B\), and \(\neg A \wedge \neg B\),
but does not consider the alternative \(\neg (A \wedge B)\). The
probability of \(\neg (A \wedge B)\) may actually exceed that of
\(A\wedge B\). If \(\neg (A \wedge B)\) is the alternative hypothesis,
the standard might not be met for the composite claim \(A \wedge B\),
even when the standard is met for individual claims \(A\) and \(B\)
(for another critique of Cheng&rsquo;s approach, see Allen &amp; Stein
2013).</p>

<p>
Finally, legal probabilists can pursue a holistic approach in response
to the conjunction paradox. This solution has been defended by
opponents of legal probabilism (Allen 1986; Allen and Pardo 2019), but
can also be adopted by legal probabilists. Instead of assessing the
posterior probabilities of individual claims given individual pieces
of evidence, the holistic approach recommends assessing the
probability of the overall composite claim, say \(A \wedge B\), in
light of all the evidence available (Hedden and Colyvan, 2019; see
however the response by Allen 2020). Bayesian networks (see earlier
discussion in <a href="#BayeNetwForLegaAppl">Section 3</a>) can help
to assess the evidence holistically (de Zoete, Sjerps, and Meester
2017; de Zoete and Sjerps 2018; Neil et al. 2019).</p>

<h3 id="CoheOtheObje">7.2 Cohen&rsquo;s other objections</h3>

<p>
Cohen (1977) leveled a few other objections against legal probabilism.
They are less well-known than the paradoxes of naked statistical
evidence or the conjunction paradox, but are still worth
examining.</p>

<h4 id="Comp">7.2.1 Completeness</h4>

<p>
The statement \(\Pr(\neg H\pmid E) = 1-\Pr(H\pmid E)\) is a theorem of
the probability calculus. If the probability of \(H\) given \(E\) is
low, the probability of \(\neg H\) given the same evidence must be
high. This fact may seem to create evidence from ignorance. If \(E\)
is meager evidence of \(H\) (that is, \(\Pr(H \pmid E)\) is low), it
must be strong evidence for the negation of \(H\) (that is, \(\Pr(\neg
H \pmid E)\) is high). This seems wrong. Intuitively, some evidence
can weakly support both a hypothesis and its negation. For example,
suppose one has heard a rumor that the defendant spent the night at
the bar when the crime was committed. The rumor is weak evidence for
the claim that the defendant spent the night at the bar. It does not
follow that the rumor is strong evidence that the defendant did
<em>not</em> spend the night at the bar. Evidence may actually have no
bearing whatsoever on a hypothesis. Probability seems unable to
capture this fact, or at least this is the objection.</p>

<p>
This difficulty motivated the development of a non-classical theory of
probability and evidential support by Dempster (1968) and Shafer
(1976). Legal probabilists, however, need not reject classical
probability theory. They can respond that the difficulty just
described arises only because one is inclined to measure the strength
of evidence in terms of the posterior probability \(\Pr(H \pmid E)\),
rather than by means of the likelihood ratio (on this distinction, see
earlier in
 <a href="#StreEvid">Section 2</a>).
 If \(E\) weakly supports \(H\)&mdash;that is, the likeklihood ratio</p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(E \pmid H)}{\Pr(E \pmid \neg H)}\]

<p>
is barely above one&mdash;it does not follow that \(E\) strongly
supports \(\neg H\). In fact, it rather follows follows that \(E\)
weakly disfavors \(\neg H\), because</p> 

\[\frac{\Pr(E \pmid \neg H)}{\Pr(E \pmid H)}\]

<p> 
will be slightly below one.</p>

<h4 id="Corr">7.2.2 Corroboration</h4>

<p>
When two or more independent witnesses testify to the truth of the
same proposition, and their stories are relatively unlikely, the
probability of the proposition in question should increase
significantly. This phenomenon of &ldquo;confidence boost&rdquo; is
known as corroboration. In case of circumstantial evidence, the
analogous phenomenon is called convergence. Cohen (1977) argues that
no probabilistic measure of evidential support captures this
phenomenon. He examines different probabilistic
proposals&mdash;Boole&rsquo;s formula (Boole 1857),
Ekel&ouml;f&rsquo;s principle (Ekel&ouml;f 1964), a formula due to
Lambert and Kruskal (1988)&mdash;and finds them inadequate. He argues
that the confidence boost that is expected from corroboration is not
adequately captured by any of these proposals.</p>

<p>
More recently, better probabilistic accounts of corroboration have
been developed (Fenton and Neil 2013 [2018]; Robertson, Vignaux,
and Berger 2016; Taroni et al. 2014). A recurrent theme in this line
of work is that corroboration can be accounted for in probabilistic
terms by multiplying the likelihood ratios of the individual pieces of
evidence. The thought is that the result of multiplying the likelihood
ratios of different pieces of evidence combined exceeds the likelihood
ratios associated with the individual pieces of evidence (see general
discussion in Bovens and Hartmann 2004: ch. 5). Cohen, however,
insisted that the confidence boost due to corroboration should be
large, and the large boost is not reflected as a result of multiplying
the likelihood ratios. What needs further exploring is the size of the
confidence boost and the features of the evidence that affect the
boost. Urbaniak and Janda (2020) offer a detailed discussion of
Cohen&rsquo;s objections and candidates for a solution.</p>

<h3 id="ProbPrio">7.3 The problem of priors</h3>

<p>
Another objection often leveled against legal probabilism is the
problem of priors. This problem emerges as one sets out to assess the
posterior probability of a hypothesis given the available evidence,
\(\Pr(H \pmid E)\).</p>

<p>
To carry out the calculations, Bayes&rsquo; theorem requires as a
starting point the prior probability of the hypothesis, \(\Pr(H)\),
irrespective of the evidence. The correct assessment of this prior
probability is by no means obvious. Different strategies have been
proposed.</p>

<p>
First, the prior probability can be equated to \(1/k\) where \(k\) is
the number of alternative equiprobable hypotheses. If there are \(k\)
possible hypotheses and no one is more probable than the other, it is
natural to assign \(1/k\) to each hypothesis. This approach, however,
would render prior probabilities quite sensitive to the choice of
hypotheses and thus potentially arbitrary. In addition, this approach
is particularly unsuitable for criminal cases. If two hypotheses are
&ldquo;the defendant is guilty&rdquo; and &ldquo;the defendant is
innocent&rdquo;, the prior probability of each would be 50%.
Defendants in criminal cases, however, should be presumed innocent
until proven guilty. Prior probability of guilt at the level of .5
seems excessive. The presumption of innocence&mdash;a procedural
protection afforded to all defendants in many countries&mdash;should
require that the prior probability of guilt be set to a small value
(Allen et al. 1995). But it is unclear how low that value
should be. Would .001 be sufficiently low or should it be .000001? All
that can be said, perhaps, is that in criminal cases the prior
probability of guilt should be extremely low (Friedman 2000).</p>

<p>
Alternatively, the prior probability can be equated to \(1/n\) where
\(n\) is the number of total possible suspects or wrongdoers who could
have committed the crime or civil wrong under dispute at trial. This,
too, is a plausible proposal. Since someone must have committed the
wrong, absent any further evidence anyone could have committed it, so
\(1/n\) is a reasonable starting point. But this proposal also quickly
runs into difficulties. In some cases, whether a wrong was committed
by anyone can itself be disputed. Or there might be cases in which an
illegal act was certainly committed and the defendant took part in it,
but it is not clear what illegal act it was, say murder or
manslaughter.</p>

<p>
To avoid some of the difficulties described above, other models
rely on relevant background information, for example, geographical
information about people&rsquo;s opportunities to commit crimes
(Fenton et al. 2019). But even if these models are
successful in giving well-informed assessments of prior probabilities,
a deeper difficulty lingers. That is, any assessment of prior
probabilities, no matter how it is done, is likely to violate existing
normative requirements of the trial system (Dahlman 2017; Engel 2012;
Schweizer 2013). If the assessment of prior probabilities relies on
demographic information, people who belong to certain demographic
groups will be regarded as having a higher prior probability of
committing a wrong than others. But if some people&rsquo;s priors are
higher than other people&rsquo;s priors, it will be easier to convict
or find liable those who are assigned higher priors, even if the
evidence against them is the same as the evidence against those
assigned lower priors. This outcome can be seen as unfair, especially
in criminal cases, since it exposes to a higher risk of conviction
those innocents who are assigned a higher prior probability because of
the demographic group they belong to (Di Bello and O&rsquo;Neil
2020).</p>

<p>
Perhaps, as some have suggested, legal probabilists should do away
with prior probabilities and rely on likelihood ratios instead as a
guide for trial decisions (Sullivan 2019). Another strategy for
avoiding the problem of priors is to consider an interval of values
and see the extent to which different possible priors affect the
posterior probability (Finkelstein and Fairley 1970), as discussed
in
 <a href="#WherDoNumbCome">Section 1.4</a>.</p>
 
<h3 id="RefeClasProb">7.4 The reference class problem</h3>

<p>
Another challenge to legal probabilism is the reference class problem.
The reference class problem, originally formulated by Venn (1866),
arises because the same event may belong to multiple reference classes
in which the frequencies of the event in question are different. A
common approach, given among others by Reichenbach (1935 [1949: 374]),
is to rely on &ldquo;the narrowest class for which reliable statistics
can be compiled&rdquo;. This may work in some cases provided reliable
statistics are available. But what if someone belongs to different
classes that are equally narrow?</p>

<p>
Consider the case of Charles Shonubi, a Nigerian citizen working in
New Jersey, who was arrested on 10 December 1991 at JFK Airport in New
York for smuggling heroin into the United States. He was found
carrying 103 balloons in his gastrintestinal tract containing 427.4
grams of heroin. During the sentencing proceedings, the prosecutor
argued that since Shonubi made seven trips between the United States
and Nigeria prior to his arrest, he smuggled a larger total quantity
of heroin than 427.4 grams. The prosecution offered data on amounts of
heroin seized from 117 Nigerian drug smugglers who were arrested at
JFK airport between 1 September 1990 and 10 December 1991. The expert
for the prosecutor, Dr. Boyum, calculated that it was 99% likely that
Shonubi smuggled at least 2090.2 grams in total before his final trip
(<span class="casecite">U.S. v. Shonubi 895 F. Supp 460, E.D.N.Y.
1995</span>).</p>

<p>
Shonubi was a member of the reference class &ldquo;people found
carrying heroin while traveling between Nigeria and New York&rdquo;
but also the class &ldquo;toll collectors at the George Washington
bridge&rdquo;. Why rely on the former and not the latter to make
inferences about how much heroin Shonubi smuggled into the United
States? (Colyvan, Regan, and Ferson 2001). What follows examines the specific
difficulties that the reference class problem poses for legal
probabilism and how legal probabilists might respond.</p>

<h4 id="Chal">7.4.1 The challenge</h4>

<p>
Allen and Pardo (2007) argue that the reference class problem poses
a challenge for legal probabilism and more specifically for
probabilistic measures of evidentiary strength such as likelihood
ratios (see earlier in
 <a href="#StreEvid">Section 2</a>).
 The problem is that the same piece of evidence may be assigned
different likelihood ratios depending on the reference class chosen.
For example, the denominator in the likelihood ratio associated with a
DNA match is the probability of a match given that a random person,
unrelated to the crime, is the source. This probability depends on the
frequency of the profile in a select population. But which reference
population should one choose? Since nothing in the natural world picks
out one reference class over another&mdash;the argument goes&mdash;the
likelihood ratio would be an arbitrary measure of evidentiary
strength.</p>

<p>
It is tempting to dismiss this challenge by noting that expert
witnesses work with multiple reference classes and entertain plausible
ranges of values (Nance 2007). In fact, relying on multiple reference
classes is customary in the assessment of DNA evidence. In <span class="casecite">Darling
v. State, 808 So. 2d 145 (Fla. 2002)</span>,
for example, a Polish woman living in Orlando was sexually assaulted
and killed. The DNA expert testified about multiple random match
probabilities, relying on frequencies about African-Americans,
Caucasians and Southeastern Hispanics from the Miami area. Since the
perpetrator could have belonged to any of these ethnic groups, the
groups considered by the expert were all relevant under different
scenarios of what could have happened.</p>

<p>
Unlike expert witnesses, appellate courts often prefer that only one
reference class be considered. In another case, Michael Pizarro, who
matched the crime traces, was convicted of raping and suffocating his
13-year-old-half-sister (<span class="casecite">People v. Pizarro, 110
Cal.App.4th 530, 2003</span>). The FBI analyst testified at trial that
the likelihood of finding another unrelated Hispanic individual with
the same genetic profile was approximately \(\slashfrac{1}{250,000}\).
Since the race of the perpetrator was not known, Pizarro appealed
arguing that the DNA evidence was inadmissible. The appellate court
sided with Pizarro and objected to the presentation of frequency
estimates for the Hispanic population as well as frequencies for any
other racial or ethnic groups. The court wrote: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
It does not matter how many Hispanics, Caucasians, Blacks, or Native
Americans resemble the perpetrator if the perpetrator is actually
Asian.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The uneasiness that appellate courts display when expert witnesses
testify about multiple references classes is understandable. Perhaps,
the reference class most favorable to the defendant should be
selected, giving the accused the benefit of the doubt. This might be
appropriate in some cases. But suppose the random match probability
associated with a DNA match is 1 in 10 for people in group A, while it
is 1 in 100 million for people in group B. Always going for the
reference class that is most favorable to the defendant will in some
cases weaken the incriminating force of DNA matches more than
necessary.</p>

<h4 id="ReleCritQues">7.4.2 Relevance and critical questions</h4>

<p>
Legal probabilists have formulated different criteria for identifying
the most appropriate reference class. Franklin (2011) is optimistic.
On his approach, the most appropriate reference class for drawing an
inference about an event or outcome \(B\) is the class defined by the
intersection of all the features that are relevant to \(B\). Relevance
is measured statistically given the available data as the co-variation
of \(B\) with the feature in question. Co-variation will be measured
using appropriate statistical criteria, such as the correlation
coefficient between two variables. For instance, in the Shonubi case,
features such as being Nigerian, drug courier, traveling toward JFK,
were all relevant for making an inference about the total amount of
drugs Shonubi carried. Other features for which data were available,
such as being a toll collector at the George Washington Bridge, were
not relevant. The optimism of Franklin&rsquo;s approach, however, is
dimmed by the pervasiveness of the reference class problem (for more
details, see H&aacute;jek 2007).</p>

<p>
Instead of focusing on relevance only, the choice of the most
appropriate reference class may also include a mix of statistical (or
epistemic) criteria as well as non-epistemic criteria. Dahlman (2018)
proposes a list of critical questions, such as: Is the reference class
heterogeneous or homogeneous? Is it robust? Does it put people in the
reference class at an unfair disadvantage? The first two questions are
epistemic, but the third is not. If people in certain ethnic or
socio-economic groups engage in criminal acts more often than others,
relying on ethnic or socio-economic reference classes may heighten
society&rsquo;s stigma and prejudice toward members of these groups.
Relying on these reference classes should therefore be avoided, not
because they are irrelevant but because they are prejudicial.</p>

<h4 id="ModeSele">7.4.3 Model selection</h4>

<p>
The reference class problem can be thought of as a particular case of 
the model selection problem (Cheng 2009).  The model should capture the data to some extent, but not overfit the data. Random variation in the data should not be built
into the model. In statistics, different criteria for model selection
exists, most notably the Akaike&rsquo;s Information Criterion (AIC),
which is a popular measure of the trade-off between model&rsquo;s fit
with the data and its complexity. Consider the Shonubi case again. In
order to predict the total amount of heroin Shonubi transported, a
simple linear model could be used, where each reference <span class="sans-serif">class</span>
comes with an empirically established
multiplier \(\beta\) for the expected total amount of drugs carried
based on how much drugs one carried on a single trip. Picking too
generic a class (say, &ldquo;airline passenger&rdquo;) would lower the
empirical adequacy of the model, but relying on too narrow a class
would incorporate random noise. A model using the class &ldquo;<span class="sans-serif">toll
collector</span>&rdquo; would clearly perform
(in terms of statistical measures such as AIC) worse than, say a model
based on the class &ldquo;<span class="sans-serif">Nigerian drug
courier at JFK</span>&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Colyvan and Regan (2007) argue that the reference class problem is a
form of model uncertainty. For them, the reference class problem stems from uncertainty about the particular statistical model that should be employed. Model
uncertainty is evident in the Shonubi case as alternative models were
discussed. The first model consisted in multiplying the amount which
Shonubi was found carrying when he was arrested by the number of trips
he made between the Nigeria and New York. Admittedly, this model was
too simplistic. The expert witness for the prosecution, Dr. Boyum,
developed a second model. It was based on the DEA data and consisted
in the simulation of 100,000 possible series of seven trips by
re-sampling sets of seven net weights from the 117 known cases.</p>

<p>
Boyum&rsquo;s model was criticized by another expert in the case, Dr.
Finkelstein, who complained that the model did not take into
consideration systematic differences between trips. Presumably,
smugglers will tend to carry larger quantities as they become more
experienced. When they carry larger quantities, it should be more
likely they would be apprehended. If the trip effect holds, the data
would mostly be about advanced smugglers who tend to carry more than
beginners. No empirical evidence for or against the trip effect theory
could be found. Information on the number of previous trips was
missing from the data so an appropriate regression model for the trip
effect could not be developed. On other other hand, Judge Weinstein
argued that beginner smugglers do practice swallowing with grapes, and
thus the learning curve should not be excessively steep. In addition,
beginners are more likely to be apprehended than advanced smugglers.
If so, the data would not be biased by the trip effect. Interestingly,
information on Nigerian drug smuggling practices undermines the trip
effect theory: the drug cartel did not waste money on sending
half-filled drug mules, but rather made them practice swallowing
balloons weeks prior to their first trip (Treaser 1992; Wren
1999).</p>

<p>
Statistical analyses of the evidence in Shonubi were published after
the case was decided. These analyses took into account other potential
sources of error, such as outliers and biased data. Gastwirth,
Freidlin, and Miao (2000) showed that, because of sensitivity to
outliers, the inference that the total amount was above 3000 grams was
unstable. However, even looking at the data in the light most
favorable to the defendant, the total amount of drugs should be above
the 1000 gram threshold (Gastwirth,
Freidlin, and Miao 2000; Izenman 2000a,b).</p>

<p>
Besides Shonubi, many other cases raise the reference class or model
selection in their own way. Just to list a few:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
<em>Vuyanich v.&#8198;Republic National Bank</em> involved race and
sex discrimination allegation. The case involved nine different expert
witnesses deploying various statistical analyses. The case ended with
a 127-page opinion.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
<em>E.E.O.C. v.&#8198;Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond</em> was a
similar case, where the appropriateness of various methods for group
comparisons and the choice of level of aggregation for the analysis of
employment data was at play.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
<em>Gulf South Insulation v.&#8198;U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission</em> was related to banning the use of urea-formaldehyde
foam insulation. The difficulty lied in the choice of a risk
assessment model to calculate the risk of increased incidence of
cancer.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
These cases are interesting as well as complicated. They are discussed
in some detail in Fienberg (1989).</p>

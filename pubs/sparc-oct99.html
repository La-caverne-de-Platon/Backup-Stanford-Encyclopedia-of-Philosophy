<p>
 There are innovative efforts underway to address the "other"
publishing crisis, namely that of costly publications in the
humanities. In this article, I'll describe one such new effort &mdash;
the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy &mdash; and the challenges it
faces in the attempt to remain independent of commercial
publishers.</p>

<p>
 In August 1998, Routledge published a new Encyclopedia of
Philosophy. The pre-publication price was $3,000 (with CD). It was an
expensive project to complete and so one might expect the result to be
costly. But the fact is that the Routledge Encyclopedia was already
out of date when it was published, for many of the entries had been
written several years prior to August 1998!</p>

<p>
 At Stanford University's Center for the Study of Language and
Information, we are building a new and alternative kind of reference
work. 
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/" target="other">The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a>
 (SEP), in contrast to the Routledge work, is a "dynamic" reference
work. It enables professional philosophers around the world to
collectively maintain a refereed, continuously updatable, online
reference work. To implement this new concept, we developed a
work-flow system which gives the authors of our entries and the
members of our Board of Editors special password-protected access to
our web server.</p>

<p>
 SEP authors are chosen to write entries on the basis of their
expertise. They can upload their entries (and subsequent changes to
their entries) to a private location on our server visible only to our
Editorial Board members. The latter are notified whenever new entries
or changes to entries have been posted and they can use a special web
interface to view and referee the new content. So as authors go about
their research and discover new and important work on their topics,
they can access and update their entry, and their modifications will
be vetted before publication. Errors and omissions can be corrected
whenever they are discovered, and users can cite fixed, quarterly
archives of the SEP.</p>

<p>
 A dynamic reference work therefore offers a rational approach to the
task of tracking the important new ideas that are being published both
in print and web-based media. So far, over 325 experts have accepted
commissions to author and maintain 400 entries. These entries fall
under 35 different general subject areas in philosophy, and for each
subject area, there are often two or more subject editors who sit on
our Editorial Board (there are now 60 members on our
Board). Currently, over 100 of the commissioned entries have been
written and are being maintained.</p>

<p>
 Dynamic reference works are not intended as replacements for
electronic journals, for the latter are needed as forums dedicated
solely to new research. But there are differences between the two
kinds of publications. Electronic journals: (1) do not (and should
not) update the articles they publish, (2) do not (and should not) aim
to publish articles that introduce a comprehensive set of topics, (3)
typically serve an audience of specialists, and (4) do not have to
deal with the asynchronous activity of updating, refereeing, and
tracking separate deadlines for entries, since they are published on a
synchronized schedule.</p>

<p>
 We think that academics in other professions will see the value of
dynamic reference works and organize similar projects. But in choosing
to remain independent and low-cost, we do face hard questions. The
most pressing of these is how to fund our project over the short and
long term. The question becomes more difficult to answer when we
consider that it may take 5-10 years for our growing reference work
become mature and contain enough entries to command the attention of
potential subscribers. Our NEH grant ends in August 2000 and we hope
to obtain an NSF grant for the following three years. But without
public funding during our startup period, it is not clear what we
should do to meet our costs. The fact is that there is no proven,
sound economic model for projects like ours. Some see professional
societies as the answer. But the American Philosophical Association
currently has a policy against funding publishing projects.</p>

<p>
 Even if a publishing house were to venture into uncharted commercial
territory and offer to acquire our project, we would be reluctant to
form such an alliance, for then everything would change. The publisher
would have to pay the people who are now donating their time for the
benefit of the profession, namely, the members of our Editorial Board
and the authors. Authors would no longer be willing to format their
own entries in HTML, since they would perceive that the publisher was
offloading the task to them in order to increase profit margins. Not
only would our reference work cease to be freely accessible, but our
uncluttered, purely academic website might become filled with
advertising. Moreover, decisions which might affect the interests of
our profession (such as how much space to devote to a topic) might end
up being made by people whose principal decision-making criteria focus
on the effects that the decision will have on commerce.</p>

<p>
 We are therefore seeking library feedback as we forge our own
model. The most likely scenario for the future is that we will have to
charge university libraries around the world a yearly subscription fee
(at about the cost of a good journal in philosophy), in return for
which we would serve our pages to all the computers at their
campus. But will university libraries be willing to subscribe during
our startup period, as we grow from 100 entries to 300-500 entries?
Will librarians think that the following facts justify the expense:
(1) the entries published so far are high quality, in-depth pieces
that are informative to both students and faculty, and not just in
philosophy, (2) a minimum of 25-50 new entries are being published
each year, and (3) the published entries are being maintained and
updated?</p>

<p>
 These are important questions, and we may not discover the answers in
advance. Whatever happens, it seems certain that if a commercial
publisher were to take over our project, its cost and the cost of a
subscription would rise dramatically.</p>

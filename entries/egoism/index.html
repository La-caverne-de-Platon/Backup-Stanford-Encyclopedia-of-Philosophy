<div id="preamble">

<p>

Egoism can be a descriptive or a normative position. Psychological
egoism, the most famous descriptive position, claims that each person
has but one ultimate aim: her own welfare. Normative forms of egoism
make claims about what one ought to do, rather than describe what one
does do. Ethical egoism claims I morally ought to perform some action
if and only if, and because, performing that action maximizes my
self-interest.  Rational egoism claims that I ought to perform some
action if and only if, and because, performing that action maximizes
my self-interest. (Here the &ldquo;ought&rdquo; is not restricted to
the moral &ldquo;ought&rdquo;.)

<h2 id="PsycEgoi">1. Psychological Egoism</h2>

<p>

All forms of egoism require explication of &ldquo;self-interest&rdquo;
(or &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; or &ldquo;well-being&rdquo;). There are three
main theories. Preference or desire accounts identify self-interest
with the satisfaction of one&rsquo;s desires. Often, and most plausibly,
these desires are restricted to self-regarding desires. What makes a
desire self-regarding is controversial, but there are clear cases and
counter-cases: a desire for my own pleasure is self-regarding; a desire
for the welfare of others is not. Objective accounts identify
self-interest with the possession of states (such as virtue or
knowledge) that are valuable independently of whether they are desired.  Hybrid accounts give a role to both desires (or pleasure) and states that are valuable independently of whether they are desired.  For example, perhaps the increase to my well-being brought about by a satisfied desire (or a pleasure) itself increases insofar as it is a desire for (or pleasure in) knowledge.  Or perhaps the increase to my well-being brought about by a piece of knowledge itself increases insofar as I desire (or take pleasure in) it. 
Hedonism, which identifies self-interest with pleasure, is either a
preference or an objective account, according to whether what counts as
pleasure is determined by one&rsquo;s desires. </p>

<p>

Psychological egoism claims that each person has but one ultimate
aim: her own welfare. This allows for action that fails to maximize
perceived self-interest, but rules out the sort of behavior
psychological egoists like to target &mdash; such as altruistic behavior or
motivation by thoughts of duty alone. It allows for weakness of will,
since in weakness of will cases I am still aiming at my own welfare; I
am weak in that I do not act as I aim. And it allows for aiming at
things other than one&rsquo;s welfare, such as helping others, where these
things are a means to one&rsquo;s welfare.</p>

<p>

Psychological egoism is supported by our frequent observation of
self-interested behavior. Apparently altruistic action is often
revealed to be self-interested. And we typically motivate people by
appealing to their self-interest (through, for example, punishments and
rewards).</p>

<p>

A common objection to psychological egoism, made famously by Joseph
Butler, is that I must desire things other than my own welfare in order
to get welfare. Say I derive welfare from playing hockey. Unless I
desired, for its own sake, to play hockey, I would not derive welfare
from playing. Or say I derive welfare from helping others. Unless I
desired, for its own sake, that others do well, I would not derive
welfare from helping them. Welfare results from my action, but cannot
be the only aim of my action.</p>

<p>

The psychological egoist can concede that I must have desires for
particular things, such as playing hockey. But there is no need to
concede that the satisfaction of these desires is not part of my
welfare. My welfare might consist simply in the satisfaction of
self-regarding desires. In the case of deriving welfare from helping
others, the psychological egoist can again concede that I would not
derive welfare without desiring some particular thing, but need not
agree that what I desire for its own sake is that others do well. That
I am the one who helps them may, for example, satisfy my self-regarding
desire for power.</p>

<p>

A bigger problem for psychological egoism is that some behavior does
not seem to be explained by self-regarding desires. Say a soldier
throws himself on a grenade to prevent others from being killed. It
does not seem that the soldier is pursuing his perceived self-interest.
It is plausible that, if asked, the soldier would have said that he
threw himself on the grenade because he wanted to save the lives of
others or because it was his duty. He would deny as ridiculous the
claim that he acted in his self-interest.</p>

<p>

The psychological egoist might reply that the soldier is lying or
self-deceived. Perhaps he threw himself on the grenade because he believed that he could
not bear to live with himself afterwards if he did not do so. He has a
better life, in terms of welfare, by avoiding years of guilt. The main
problem here is that while this is a possible account of some cases,
there is no reason to think it covers all cases. Another problem is
that guilt may presuppose that the soldier has a non-self-regarding
desire for doing what he takes to be right.</p>

<p>

The psychological egoist might reply that some such account must be
right. After all, the soldier did what he most wanted to do, and so
must have been pursuing his perceived self-interest. In one sense, this
is true. If self-interest is identified with the satisfaction of all of
one&rsquo;s preferences, then all intentional action is self-interested (at
least if intentional actions are always explained by citing
preferences, as most believe). Psychological egoism turns out to be
trivially true. This would not content defenders of psychological
egoism, however. They intend an empirical theory that, like other such
theories, it is at least possible to refute by observation.</p>

<p>

There is another way to show that the trivial version of
psychological egoism is unsatisfactory. We ordinarily think there is a
significant difference in selfishness between the soldier&rsquo;s action and
that of another soldier who, say, pushes someone onto the grenade to
avoid being blown up himself. We think the former is acting unselfishly
while the latter is acting selfishly. According to the trivial version
of psychological egoism, both soldiers are equally selfish, since both
are doing what they most desire.</p>

<p>

The psychological egoist might handle apparent cases of
self-sacrifice, not by adopting the trivial version, but rather by
claiming that facts about the self-interest of the agent explain all
behavior. Perhaps as infants we have only self-regarding desires; we
come to desire other things, such as doing our duty, by learning that
these other things satisfy our self-regarding desires; in time, we
pursue the other things for their own sakes.</p>

<p>

Even if this picture of development is true, however, it does not
defend psychological egoism, since it admits that we sometimes
ultimately aim at things other than our welfare. An account of the
origins of our non-self-regarding desires does not show that they are
really self-regarding. The soldier&rsquo;s desire is to save others, not
increase his own welfare, even if he would not have desired to save
others unless saving others was, in the past, connected to increasing
his welfare.</p>

<p>

The psychological egoist must argue that we do not come to pursue
things other than our welfare for their own sakes. In principle, it
seems possible to show this by showing that non-self-regarding desires
do not continue for long once their connection to our welfare is
broken. However, evidence for this dependence claim has not been
forthcoming.</p>

<p>

Indeed, when examining the empirical evidence, two sorts of approach
have been used to argue against psychological egoism.</p>

<p>

First, Daniel Batson and colleagues found that increased empathy leads
to increased helping behaviour.  One hypothesis is altruistic: empathy
causes a non-instrumental desire to help.  There are many competing
egoistic hypotheses.  Empathy might cause an unpleasant experience
that subjects believe they can stop by helping; or subjects might
think failing to help in cases of high empathy is more likely to lead
to punishment by others, or that helping here is more likely to be
rewarded by others; or subjects might think this about
self-administered punishment or reward.  In an ingenious series of
experiments, Batson compared the egoistic hypotheses, one by one,
against the altruistic hypothesis.  He found that the altruistic
hypothesis always made superior predictions.  Against the unpleasant
experience hypothesis, Batson found that giving high-empathy subjects
easy ways of stopping the experience other than by helping did not
reduce helping.  Against the punishment by others hypothesis, Batson
found that letting high-empathy subjects believe that their behaviour
would be secret did not reduce helping.  Against the self-administered
reward hypothesis, Batson found that the mood of high-empathy subjects
depended on whether they believed that help was needed, whether or not
they could do the helping, rather than on whether they helped (and so
could self-reward).  Against the self-administered punishment
hypothesis, Batson found that making high-empathy subjects believe
they would feel less guilt from not helping (by letting them believe
that few others had volunteered to help) did not reduce helping.</p>

<p>

One might quibble with some of the details.  Perhaps subjects did not
believe that the easy ways of stopping the painful experience Batson
provided, such as leaving the viewing room, would stop it.  (For an
account of an experiment done in reply, favouring Batson, see Stich,
Doris and Roedder 2010, as well as Batson 2011 135&ndash;145.)
Perhaps a Batson-proof egoistic hypothesis could be offered: say that
subjects believe that the <i>only</i> way of stopping the pain (or
avoiding self-punishment) is by helping (though whether subjects have
this belief might be tested for on its own).  But on the whole,
Batson&rsquo;s experiments are very bad news for psychological egoism.  (For
further discussion of Batson, see May 2011a and Slote 2013.)</p>

<p>

Second, Elliot Sober and David Wilson argue that evolutionary theory
supports altruism.  Parental care might be explained on egoistic
grounds: a belief about the child&rsquo;s distress causes the parent pain
that the parent believes she can alleviate by helping, or the parent
believes that she will be caused pain if she does not help.  Parental
care might also be explained on altruistic grounds: the parent has a
non-instrumental desire that the child do well.  Lastly, parental care
might be explained by a combination of these mechanisms.  Sober and
Wilson argue that more reliable care would be provided by the
altruistic or combination mechanisms.  Given the importance of
parental care, this is a reason for thinking that natural selection
would have favoured one of these mechanisms.  The egoistic mechanism
is less reliable for several reasons: beliefs about the child&rsquo;s
distress may fail to cause the parent pain (even bodily injury does
not always cause pain, so pain is unlikely to be always caused by
beliefs about distress); the parent may fail to believe that helping
will best reduce her pain; there may not be enough pain produced; the
combination view has the advantage of an extra mechanism.</p>

<p>

This argument has drawbacks.  Natural selection does not always
provide back-up mechanisms (I have but one liver).  Natural selection
sometimes has my desires caused by affect that is produced by a belief
rather than directly by the belief (my desire to run away from danger
is often caused by my fear, rather than by the mere belief that there
is danger).  And in these cases, as in the case of the imperfectly
correlated pain and bodily injury, there seems usually to
be <i>enough</i> affect.  The altruistic hypothesis also has some of
the same problems: for example, just as there might not be enough
pain, the non-instrumental desire that the child do well might not be
strong enough to defeat other desires.  Indeed, without an estimate of
how strong this desire is, there is no reason to think the egoistic
hypothesis is less reliable.  It may have more points at which it can
go wrong, but produce more care than a direct but weak altruistic
mechanism.  (For many of these worries, and others, see Stich, Doris
and Roedder 2010.)</p>

<p>      

Even if evolutionary arguments can be met, however, psychological
egoism faces the problems noted earlier.  In response, the
psychological egoist might move to what Gregory Kavka (1986, 64&ndash;80)
calls &ldquo;predominant egoism:&rdquo; we act unselfishly only
rarely, and then typically where the sacrifice is small and the gain
to others is large or where those benefiting are friends, family, or
favorite causes. Predominant egoism is not troubled by the soldier
counter-example, since it allows exceptions; it is not trivial; and it
seems empirically plausible.  (For other weakened positions, see
LaFollette 1988 and Mercer 2001.)</p>

<h2 id="EthiEgoi">2. Ethical Egoism</h2>

<p>

Ethical egoism claims that I morally ought to perform some action if and only if, and because, performing that action maximizes my self-interest.  (There
are possibilities other than maximization. One might, for example,
claim that one ought to achieve a certain level of welfare, but that
there is no requirement to achieve more. Ethical egoism might also
apply to things other than acts, such as rules or character traits.
Since these variants are uncommon, and the arguments for and against
them are largely the same as those concerning the standard version, I set them aside.)</p>

<p>

One issue concerns how much ethical egoism differs in content from
standard moral theories. It might appear that it differs a great deal.
After all, moral theories such as Kantianism, utilitarianism, and
common-sense morality require that an agent give weight to the
interests of others. They sometimes require uncompensated sacrifices,
particularly when the loss to the agent is small and the gain to others
is large. (Say the cost to me of saving a drowning person is getting my
shirtsleeve wet.) Ethical egoists can reply, however, that egoism
generates many of the same duties to others. The argument runs as
follows. Each person needs the cooperation of others to obtain goods
such as defense or friendship. If I act as if I give no weight to
others, others will not cooperate with me. If, say, I break my promises
whenever it is in my direct self-interest to do so, others will not
accept my promises, and may even attack me. I do best, then, by acting
as if others have weight (provided they act as if I have weight in
return).</p>

<p>

It is unlikely that this argument proves that ethical egoism
generates all of the standard duties to others. For the argument
depends on the ability of others to cooperate with me or attack me
should I fail to cooperate. In dealings with others who lack these
abilities, the egoist has no reason to cooperate. The duties to others
found in standard moral theories are not conditional in this way. I do
not, for example, escape a duty to save a drowning person, when I can
easily do so, just because the drowning person (or anyone watching)
happens never to be able to offer fruitful cooperation or
retaliation.</p>

<p>

The divergence between ethical egoism and standard moral theories
appears in other ways.</p>

<p>

First, the ethical egoist will rank as most important duties that
bring her the highest payoff. Standard moral theories determine
importance at least in part by considering the payoff to those helped.
What brings the highest payoff to me is not necessarily what brings the
highest payoff to those helped. I might, for example, profit more from
helping the local Opera society refurbish its hall than I would from
giving to famine relief in Africa, but standard moral theories would
rank famine relief as more important than Opera hall improvements.</p>

<p>

Second, the cooperation argument cannot be extended to justify
extremely large sacrifices, such as the soldier falling on the grenade,
that standard moral theories rank either as most important or
supererogatory. The cooperation argument depends on a short-term loss
(such as keeping a promise that it is inconvenient to keep) being
recompensed by a long-term gain (such as being trusted in future
promises). Where the immediate loss is one&rsquo;s life (or irreplaceable
features such as one&rsquo;s sight), there is no long-term gain, and so no
egoist argument for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>

An ethical egoist might reply by taking the cooperation argument
further. Perhaps I cannot get the benefits of cooperation without
converting to some non-egoist moral theory. That is, it is not enough
that I act as if others have weight; I must really give them weight. I
could still count as an egoist, in the sense that I have adopted the
non-egoist theory on egoist grounds.</p>

<p>

One problem is that it seems unlikely that I can get the benefits of
cooperation only by conversion. Provided I act as if others have weight
for long enough, others will take me as giving them weight, and so
cooperate, whether I really give them weight or not. In many
situations, others will neither have the ability to see my true
motivation nor care about it.</p>

<p>

Another problem is that conversion can be costly. I might be
required by my non-egoist morality to make a sacrifice for which I
cannot be compensated (or pass up a gain so large that passing it up
will not be compensated for). Since I have converted from egoism, I can
no longer reject making the sacrifice or passing up the gain on the
ground that it will not pay. It is safer, and seemingly feasible, to
remain an egoist while cooperating in most cases. If so, ethical egoism
and standard moralities will diverge in some cases. (For discussion of
the cooperation argument, see Frank 1988; Gauthier 1986 ch. 6; Kavka
1984 and 1986 Part II; Sidgwick 1907 II.V.)</p>

<p>

There is another way to try to show that ethical egoism and standard
moral theories do not differ much. One might hold one particular
objective theory of self-interest, according to which my welfare lies
in possessing the virtues required by standard moral theories. This
requires an argument to show that this particular objective theory
gives the right account of self-interest. It also faces a worry for any
objective theory: objective theories seem implausible as accounts of
welfare. If, say, all my preferences favor my ignoring the plight of
others, and these preferences do not rest on false beliefs about issues
such as the likelihood of receiving help, it seems implausible (and
objectionably paternalistic) to claim that &ldquo;really&rdquo; my
welfare lies in helping others. I may have a duty to help others, and
the world might be better if I helped others, but it does not follow
that I am better off by helping others. (For a more optimistic verdict
on this strategy, noting its roots in Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the
Stoics, and the British Idealists, see Brink 1997 and 2003.)</p>

<p>

Of course the divergence between ethical egoism and standard moral
theories need not bother an ethical egoist. An ethical egoist sees
egoism as superior to other moral theories. Whether it is superior
depends on the strength of the arguments for it. Two arguments are
popular.</p>

<p>

First, one might argue for a moral theory, as one argues for a
scientific theory, by showing that it best fits the evidence. In the
case of moral theories, the evidence is usually taken to be our most
confident common-sense moral judgments. Egoism fits many of these, such
as the requirements of cooperation in ordinary cases. It fits some
judgments better than utilitarianism does. For example, it allows one
to keep some good, such as a job, for oneself, even if giving the good
to someone else would help him slightly more, and it captures the
intuition that I need not let others exploit me. The problem is that,
as the discussion of the cooperation argument shows, it also fails to
fit some of the confident moral judgments we make.</p>

<p>

Second, one might argue for a moral theory by showing that it is
dictated by non-moral considerations -- in particular, by facts about
motivation. It is commonly held that moral judgments must be practical,
or capable of motivating those who make them. If psychological egoism
were true, this would restrict moral judgments to those made by egoism.
Other moral judgments would be excluded since it would be impossible to
motivate anyone to follow them.</p>

<p>

One problem with this argument is that psychological egoism seems
false. Replacing psychological with predominant egoism loses the key
claim that it is impossible to motivate anyone to make an uncompensated
sacrifice.</p>

<p>

The ethical egoist might reply that, if predominant egoism is true,
ethical egoism may require less deviation from our ordinary actions
than any standard moral theory. But fit with motivation is hardly
decisive; any normative theory, including ethical egoism, is intended
to guide and criticize our choices, rather than simply endorse whatever
we do. When I make an imprudent choice, this does not count against
ethical egoism, and in favor of a theory recommending imprudence.</p>

<p>

The argument has other problems. One could deny that morality must
be practical in the required sense. Perhaps morality need not be
practical at all: we do not always withdraw moral judgments when we
learn that the agent could not be motivated to follow them. Or perhaps
moral judgments must be capable of motivating not just anyone, but only
idealized versions of ourselves, free from (say) irrationality. In this
case, it is insufficient to describe how we are motivated; what is
relevant is a description of how we would be motivated were we
rational.</p>

<p>

Finally, if I do not believe that some action is ultimately in my
self-interest, it follows from psychological egoism that I cannot aim
to do it. But say I am wrong: the action is in my self-interest.
Ethical egoism then says that it is right for me to do something I
cannot aim to do. It violates practicality just as any other moral
theory does.</p>

<p>

So far a number of arguments for ethical egoism have been
considered. There are a number of standard arguments against it.</p>

<p>

G. E. Moore argued that ethical egoism is self-contradictory.  If I am
an egoist, I hold that I ought to maximize my good.  I deny that
others ought to maximize my good (they should maximize their own
goods).  But to say that <em>x</em> is &ldquo;my good&rdquo; is just
to say that my possessing <em>x</em> is good.  (I cannot possess the
goodness.)  If my possession of <em>x</em> is good, then I must hold
that others ought to maximize my possession of it.  I both deny and am
committed to affirming that others ought to maximize my good.
(Sometimes Moore suggests instead that &ldquo;my good&rdquo; be
glossed as &ldquo;<em>x</em> is good and <em>x</em> is mine.&rdquo;
This does not yield the contradiction above, since it does not claim
that my possession of <em>x</em> is good.  But it yields a different
contradiction: if <em>x</em> is good, everyone ought to maximize it
wherever it appears; egoists hold that I ought to maximize <em>x</em>
only when it appears in me.)</p>

<p>

In reply, C. D. Broad rightly noted that this does not show that
egoism is <i>self</i>-contradictory, since it is not part of egoism to
hold that what is good ought to be pursued by everyone (Broad 1942).
But that reply does not defend egoism from the charge of falsity.  To
do so, one might understand &ldquo;my good&rdquo; not as composed from
what Moore calls &ldquo;good absolutely,&rdquo; but as being a <i>sui
generis</i> concept, good-for-me (Mackie 1976, Smith 2003), or as
analyzed in terms of what I, from my point of view, ought to desire.
In neither of these cases does it follow from &ldquo;my possession of
<em>x</em> is good-for-me&rdquo; that others ought to maximize what is
good-for-me.  One might even argue that claims about &ldquo;good
absolutely&rdquo; do not justify claims about what one ought to do,
without in addition there being a special relation between the agent
and the proposed change.  If so, it does not follow simply from my
possession of <em>x</em> being good that others ought to do anything
(Prichard 2002 217).</p>

<p>

Moore also suggests that the reason for me to pursue my good is the
goodness of the thing I obtain.  If what I obtain is good, then there
is reason for everyone to pursue it, not just in me, but anywhere.
Again, moving to good-for-me avoids this consequence.  But something
close to this argument is plausible, especially for some bad things.  One
might argue that it is the way my pain feels &mdash; its badness &mdash; and not
any connection between me and the pain that gives me reason to
alleviate it.  If so, I have reason to alleviate the pain of others
(Nagel 1986, Rachels 2002).  (This argument can be directed against
rational egoism as well.)</p>

<p>

A second argument against ethical egoism was made by
H. A. Prichard. He argues that self-interest is the wrong sort of
reason.  I do not, for example, think the reason I have a duty to help
a drowning child is that helping benefits me (Prichard 2002 1, 9, 26,
29, 30, 122, 123, 171, 188).  Similarly, Prichard chastises Sidgwick
for taking seriously the view that there is &ldquo;a <i>duty</i>...to
do those acts which we think will lead to our happiness&rdquo;
(Prichard 2002 135).</p>

<p>

This is convincing when &ldquo;duty&rdquo; means &ldquo;moral
duty.&rdquo; It is less convincing when, as Prichard also thinks, the
issue is simply what one ought to do.  He takes there to be only one
sense of &ldquo;ought,&rdquo; which he treats as &ldquo;morally
ought.&rdquo; Any other &ldquo;ought&rdquo; is treated as really
making the non-normative claim that a certain means is efficient for
attaining a certain end.  But ethical egoism can be seen as making
categorical ought-claims.  And the historical popularity of ethical
egoism, which Prichard so often notes, indicates that self-interest is
not obviously irrelevant to what one ought to do (in a not
specifically moral sense).</p>

<p>

One might also object to Prichard-style arguments that (a) they are
question-begging, since egoists will hardly agree that my reason for
helping is something other than the benefit to me, and (b) given
disagreement over this claim about my reason, the appropriate response
is to suspend judgment about it.  Alison Hills, in 2010 parts II and III (directed at
rational egoism), replies to (a) that moralists can assure themselves
by giving arguments that start from premises like &ldquo;I have a
reason to help regardless of whether doing so contributes to my
self-interest,&rdquo; provided this premiss is not inferred from the
falsity of rational egoism &mdash; perhaps it is self-evident.  In
reply to (b), she argues that disagreement over the premiss does not
require moralists to suspend judgment about it, although disagreement
over an egoistic premiss like &ldquo;I have reason to help only
because doing so benefits me&rdquo; does require egoists to suspend judgment.  The
difference is that rational egoists aim at knowledge, and for putative
knowledge, in cases of disagreement between epistemic peers,
suspension of belief is required.  Moralists aim primarily not at
knowledge but at the ability to draw, on their own, true moral
conclusions from the evidence.  Since aiming at this ability
requires <i>not</i> giving weight to the conclusions of others,
suspension of belief in cases of disagreement is not required of
them.</p>

<p>

Obviously, much here depends on the claim about the aim of moralists.
One might object that moralists care much more about getting true
moral conclusions than about arriving at them on their own. If I could
guarantee that I do the right act by relying on a Moral Answers
Machine (and not otherwise), I ought to do so.  In addition, since
moralists do want true moral conclusions, and peer disagreement is
relevant to pursuing truth, Hills&rsquo; moralists both need and cannot (by
one means) pursue truth.</p>

<p>

A third argument, like Moore&rsquo;s, claims that ethical egoism is
inconsistent in various ways. Say ethical egoism recommends
that <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> both go to a certain hockey game, since
going to the game is in the self-interest of each.  Unfortunately,
only one seat remains. Ethical egoism, then, recommends an impossible
state of affairs. Or say that I am <em>A</em> and an ethical egoist. I
both claim that <em>B</em> ought to go to the game, since that is in
her self-interest, and I do not want <em>B</em> to go to the game,
since B&rsquo;s going to the game is against my self-interest.</p>

<p>

Against the first inconsistency charge, the ethical egoist can reply
that ethical egoism provides no neutral ranking of states of affairs.
It recommends to <em>A</em> that <em>A</em> go to the game, and
to <em>B</em> that <em>B</em> go to the game, but is silent on the
value of <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> both attending the game.</p>

<p>

Against the second inconsistency charge, the ethical egoist can claim
that she morally recommends that <em>B</em> go to the game, although
she desires that <em>B</em> not go. This is no more odd than claiming
that my opponent in a game would be wise to adopt a particular
strategy, while desiring that he not do so. True, the ethical egoist
is unlikely to recommend ethical egoism to others, to blame others for
violations of what ethical egoism requires, to justify herself to
others on the basis of ethical egoism, or to express moral attitudes
such as forgiveness and resentment. These publicity worries may
disqualify ethical egoism as a moral theory, but do not show
inconsistency.</p>

<p>

A fourth argument against ethical egoism is just that: ethical egoism
does not count as a moral theory. One might set various constraints on
a theory&rsquo;s being a moral theory. Many of these constraints are met by
ethical egoism &mdash; the formal constraints, for example, that moral
claims must be prescriptive and universalizable.  Ethical egoism
issues prescriptions &mdash; &ldquo;do what maximizes your
self-interest&rdquo; &mdash; and it issues the same prescriptions for
people in relevantly similar situations. But other constraints are
problematic for ethical egoism: perhaps a moral theory must sometimes
require uncompensated sacrifices; or perhaps it must supply a single,
neutral ranking of actions that each agent must follow in cases where
interests conflict; or perhaps it must respect principles such as
&ldquo;that I ought to do <em>x</em> is a consideration in favor of
others not preventing me from doing <em>x</em>;&rdquo; or perhaps it
must be able to be made public in the way, just noted, that ethical
egoism cannot. (For sample discussions of these two objections, see
Baier 1958 189&ndash;191; Campbell 1972; Frankena 1973 18&ndash;20; Kalin
1970.)</p>

<p>

The issue of what makes for a moral theory is contentious. An ethical
egoist could challenge whatever constraint is deployed against
her. But a neater reply is to move to rational egoism, which makes
claims about what one has reason to do, ignoring the topic of what is
morally right. This gets at what ethical egoists intend, while
skirting the issue of constraints on moral theories. After all, few if
any ethical egoists think of egoism as giving the correct content of
morality, while also thinking that what they have most reason to do is
determined by some non-egoist consideration. One could then, if one
wished, argue for ethical egoism from rational egoism and the
plausible claim that the best moral theory must tell me what I have
most reason to do.</p>

<h2 id="RatiEgoi">3. Rational Egoism</h2>

<p>

Rational egoism claims that I ought to perform some action if and only if, and because, performing that action maximizes my self-interest.  (As with
ethical egoism, there are variants which drop maximization or evaluate
rules or character traits rather than actions. There are also variants
which make the maximization of self-interest necessary but not
sufficient, or sufficient but not necessary, for an action to be the action I ought to perform.  Again, I set
these issues aside.) Rational egoism makes claims about what I ought, or have reason, to do, without restricting the &ldquo;ought&rdquo; or &ldquo;reason&rdquo; to a moral &ldquo;ought&rdquo; or &ldquo;reason.&rdquo; </p>

<p>

Like ethical egoism, rational egoism needs arguments to support it.
One might cite our most confident judgments about rational action and
claim that rational egoism best fits these. The problem is that our
most confident judgments about rational action seem to be captured by a
different, extremely popular theory &mdash; the instrumental theory of
rationality. According to the instrumental theory, I ought to perform some action if and only if, and because, performing that action maximizes the
satisfaction of my preferences. Since psychological egoism seems
false, it may be rational for me to make an uncompensated sacrifice for
the sake of others, for this may be what, on balance, best satisfies my
(strong, non-self-interested) preferences. This conflict with the
instrumental theory is a major problem for rational egoism.</p>

<p>

The rational egoist might reply that the instrumental theory is
equally a problem for any standard moral theory that claims to give an
account of what one ought rationally, or all things considered, to do.
If, for example, a utilitarian claims that I have most reason to give
to charity, since that maximizes the general happiness, I could object
that giving to charity cannot be rational given my particular
preferences, which are for things other than the general happiness.</p>

<p>

A different problem for rational egoism is that it appears
arbitrary. Suppose I claim that I ought to maximize the welfare of
blue-eyed people, but not of other people. Unless I can explain why
blue-eyed people are to be preferred, my claim looks arbitrary, in the
sense that I have given no reason for the different treatments. As a
rational egoist, I claim that I ought to maximize the welfare of one
person (myself). Unless I can explain why I should be preferred, my
claim looks equally arbitrary.</p>

<p>

One reply is to argue that non-arbitrary distinctions can be made by
one&rsquo;s preferences. Say I like anchovies and hate broccoli. This makes
my decision to buy anchovies rather than broccoli non-arbitrary.
Similarly, my preference for my own welfare makes my concentration on
my own welfare non-arbitrary.</p>

<p>

There are two problems for this reply.</p>

<p>

First, we do not always take preferences to establish non-arbitrary
distinctions. If I defend favoring blue-eyed people simply by noting
that I like blue-eyed people, without any justification for my liking,
this seems unsatisfactory. The rational egoist must argue that hers is
a case where preferences are decisive.</p>

<p>

Second, if psychological egoism is false, I might lack a preference
for my own welfare. It would follow that for me, a distinction between
my welfare and that of others would be arbitrary, and the rational
egoist claim that each ought to maximize his own welfare would be
unjustified when applied to me. The proposal that preferences establish
non-arbitrary distinctions supports the instrumental theory better than
rational egoism.</p>

<p>

Another reply to the arbitrariness worry is to claim that certain
distinctions just are non-arbitrary. Which distinctions these are is
revealed by looking at whether we ask for justifications of the
relevance of the distinction. In the case of my maximizing of the
welfare of the blue-eyed, we do ask for a justification; we do not take
&ldquo;because they&rsquo;re blue-eyed&rdquo; as an adequate defense of a
reason to give to the blue-eyed. In the case of my maximizing my own
welfare, however, &ldquo;because it will make me better off&rdquo; may
seem a reasonable justification; we do not quickly ask &ldquo;why does
that matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>

In a much-quoted passage, Sidgwick claimed that rational egoism is not
arbitrary: &ldquo;It would be contrary to Common Sense to deny that
the distinction between any one individual and any other is real and
fundamental, and that consequently &lsquo;I&rsquo; am concerned with the quality
of my existence as an individual in a sense, fundamentally important,
in which I am not concerned with the quality of the existence of other
individuals: and this being so, I do not see how it can be proved that
this distinction is not to be taken as fundamental in determining the
ultimate end of rational action for an individual&rdquo; (Sidgwick
1907, 498).  This can be interpreted in various ways (Shaver 1999,
82&ndash;98; Phillips 2011, ch. 5).</p>

<p>

On the most natural interpretation, Sidgwick is noting various
non-normative facts.  I have a distinct history, memories, and perhaps
special access to my mental contents.  But it is not clear how these
facts support the normative conclusion Sidgwick draws.  Utilitarians,
for example, agree about these facts.  (Some of the facts may also not
give the sharp distinction Sidgwick wants.  I may usually know more
about my pain than yours, but this difference seems a matter of
degree.)</p>

<p>

Sidgwick might instead be claiming that attacks on rational egoism
from certain views of personal identity (as in Parfit, discussed
below) fail because they rest on a false view of personal identity.
But this would only defend rational egoism against one attack.  Since
there are other attacks, it would not follow that the distinction
between people matters.</p>

<p>

Finally, Sidgwick might be claiming that my point of view, like an
impartial point of view, is non-arbitrary.  But there are other points
of view, such as that of my species, family or country.  Sidgwick
finds them arbitrary.  It is hard to see why my point of view, and an
impartial point of view, are non-arbitrary, while anything in between
is arbitrary.  For example, in favour of my point of view, Sidgwick
could note that I <i>am</i> an individual rather than a hive-member.
But I am a member of various groups as well.  And if my being an
individual is important, this cuts against the importance of taking up
an impartial point of view just as it cuts against the importance of
taking up the point of view of various groups.  Similarly, if the
impartial point of view is defended as non-arbitrary because it makes
no distinctions, both the point of view of various groups and my
individual point of view are suspect.</p>

<p>

Debate over rational egoism was revitalized by Parfit 1984 pts.
II-III. Parfit gives two main arguments against rational egoism. Both
focus on the rational egoist&rsquo;s attitude toward the future: the rational
egoist holds that the time at which some good comes is by itself
irrelevant, so that, for example, I ought to sacrifice a small present
gain for a larger future gain.</p>

<p>

First, one could challenge rational egoism, not only with the
instrumental theory, but also with the &ldquo;present-aim&rdquo;
theory of rationality. According to the present-aim theory, I have
most reason to do what maximizes the satisfaction of my present
desires. Even if all of these desires are self-regarding, the
present-aim theory need not coincide with rational egoism. Suppose I
know that in the future I will desire a good pension, but I do not now
desire a good pension for myself in the future; I have different
self-regarding desires. Suppose also that, looking back from the end
of my life, I will have maximized my welfare by contributing now to
the pension. Rational egoism requires that I contribute now. The
present-aim theory does not. It claims that my reasons are relative
not only to who has a desire &mdash; me rather than someone else &mdash; but
also to when the desire is held &mdash; now rather than in the past or
future.  The obvious justification an egoist could offer for not
caring about time &mdash; that one should care only about the <i>amount</i>
of good produced &mdash; is suicidal, since that should lead one not to
care about who receives the good.  One reason the present-aim theory
is important is that it shows there is a coherent, more minimal
alternative to rational egoism. The rational egoist cannot argue that
egoism is the most minimal theory, and that standard moral theories,
by requiring more of people, require special, additional
justification.  (For a very different argument to show again that an
alternative to morality is less minimal than expected &mdash; directed more
at the instrumental theory than rational egoism &mdash; see Korsgaard
2005.)</p>

<p>

Second, rational egoism might be challenged by some views of personal
identity.  Say half of my brain will be transplanted to another
body <em>A</em>.  My old body will be destroyed.  <em>A</em> will have
my memories, traits, and goals.  It seems reasonable for me to care
specially about <em>A</em>, and indeed to say that <em>A</em> is
identical to me.  Now say half of my brain will go in <em>B</em> and
half in <em>C</em>.  Again <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> will have my
memories, traits, and goals.  It seems reasonable for me to care
specially about <em>B</em> and <em>C</em>.  But <em>B</em>
and <em>C</em> cannot be identical to me, since they are not identical
to one another (they go on to live different lives).  So the ground of
my care is not identity, but rather the psychological connections
through memories, etc.  Even in the case of <em>A</em>, what grounds
my care are these connections, not identity: my relation to <em>A</em>
is the same as my relation to <em>B</em> (or <em>C</em>), so what
grounds my care about <em>A</em> grounds my care about <em>B</em>
(or <em>C</em>) &mdash; and that cannot be identity.  (To make the
point in a different way &mdash; I would not take steps to ensure that
only one of <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> come about.)  If so, I need not
care specially about some of my future selves, since they will not
have these connections to me.  And I do have reason to care specially
about other people who bear these connections to me now.</p>

<p>

One worry is that psychological continuity might substitute for
identity.  Say <em>F</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>F</em><sub>2</sub> are
psychologically <i>connected</i> because (for
example) <em>F</em><sub>2</sub> has a memory
of <em>F</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;s experiences.  Suppose
that <em>F</em><sub>3</sub> has a memory of <em>F</em><sub>2</sub>&rsquo;s
experiences but no memory
of <em>F</em><sub>1</sub>.  <em>F</em><sub>1</sub>
and <em>F</em><sub>3</sub> are psychologically <i>continuous</i>,
though not psychologically connected.  (Parfit&rsquo;s view is that
psychological connection and continuity both ground special care, if
special care is grounded at all.)  In the cases
above, <em>A</em>, <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> are continuous with me.
An egoist might claim that continuity alone matters for special care;
that fits the cases.  If so, I do have reason to care specially about
all of the future selves I am continuous with, and do not have this
reason to care specially about others with whom I am not continuous.
(For this and other worries about Parfit, see Brink 1992, Johnston 1997, Hills 2010
111&ndash;116.)</p>

<p>

Parfit could reply that continuity might not suffice for special care.
It is not clear that <em>F</em><sub>1</sub> has reason to care
specially about <em>F</em><sub>3</sub> &mdash; <em>F</em><sub>3</sub>
might seem a stranger, perhaps even an unlikeable one.  When young,
some worry about becoming someone they would not now like.  They see
no reason for special care for this future person.  This worry makes
sense, but if continuity were sufficient for special care, it would
not.  If so, perhaps both continuity and connection, or perhaps
continuity and admirability, are needed.  This would let Parfit keep
the conclusion that I need not care specially for some of my future
selves, but would not justify the conclusion that I have reason to
care specially about other people who are merely connected to me now
(or are merely admirable).</p>

<p>

A worry is that some do care specially about
merely continuous future selves.  With opposed intuitions about when
special care is due, the tactic of arguing from intuitions about
special care to the grounds of this care is indecisive.</p>

<p>

There is another recent argument against rational egoism (Rachels and
Alter 2005, Tersman 2008, and especially de Lazari-Radek and Singer
2014).  (1) Believing that rational egoism is true increases my
reproductive fitness, whether or not rational egoism is true. (2)
Therefore my belief that rational egoism is true (or, better, that
rational egoism appears to me true upon reflection) does not help to
justify rational egoism, since I would have that belief whether or not
rational egoism is true. (3) For some other normative beliefs (such as
belief in utilitarianism), having the belief does not increase
reproductive fitness.  (4) Therefore my belief that (say)
utilitarianism is true can help justify utilitarianism.  (Without (3)
and (4), there is no argument against rational egoism in
particular.)</p>

<p>

Here I put aside general objections to evolutionary debunking
arguments (see, for example, Shafer-Landau 2012).</p>

<p>

One worry is that what best increases reproductive fitness is acting
as a kin altruist rather than as a rational egoist (Crisp 2012, Other
Internet Resources).  Presumably, then, it is believing that I ought
to act as a kin altruist, rather than as a rational egoist, that best
increases my reproductive fitness.  (If there is a tie between what
increases reproductive fitness and belief, and believing that rational
egoism is true is best for reproductive fitness, one would expect many
to believe that rational egoism is true.  But very few do, while many
endorse Broad&rsquo;s &ldquo;self-referential altruism&rdquo; (Broad
1971b).)  De Lazari-Radek and Singer reply that the recommendations of
rational egoism are very close to those of kin altruism, and much
closer to those of kin altruism than are the recommendations of
utilitarianism (2014 194). But rational egoism and kin altruism do
make opposed recommendations. For example, kin altruism might
recommend that I sacrifice myself for my family, whether I care about
them or not, whereas rational egoism would recommend sacrifice only if
my welfare were to be higher were I to sacrifice and die rather than
not sacrifice and live. It is also hard to think of a plausible
argument which has kin altruism as a premiss and rational egoism as
the conclusion, so doubts about kin altruism do not seem to undercut
arguments for rational egoism.  Nor is it clear how noting a
difference in the closeness of recommendations justifies concluding
that rational egoism is debunked and utilitarianism not debunked.</p>

<p>

Another worry is that if my belief that I have reason to care about my
own well-being is unjustified, an argument that starts with that
reason as a premiss, and then adds that the focus on my own well-being
is arbitrary and so should be broadened to include everyone, is
undercut.  One might reply (with de Lazari-Radek and Singer 2014 191)
that there are other ways of arriving at the conclusion that I have
reason to care about the well-being of everyone. Perhaps something
like utilitarianism is justified as self-evident rather than inferred
from some other reasons.  The evolutionary argument targets
conclusions that can be reached <i>only</i> by appeal to a belief
whose support can be undercut by noting that we would have the belief
whether or not it is true.  It is then open to the rational egoist to
say that there is some other way of arriving at rational egoism.
Perhaps this is unpromising, since the obvious way to justify rational
egoism, as self-evident, is to be undercut by (1) and (2).  However,
(i) if believing that one ought to act as a kin altruist rather than
as a rational egoist is what best increases reproductive fitness,
rational egoism is, like utilitarianism, not undercut by (1) and
(2). (ii) A component of utilitarianism (and any plausible theory),
the belief that pain is bad, seems to be a belief that best increases
reproductive fitness whether or not it is true (see Kahane 2011 and
2014).  Even if nothing is good or bad, believing that pain is bad
might increase my motivation to avoid pain and so lead me to survive
longer.</p>

<p>

A further worry is that it is not clear that having the <i>belief</i>
best increases reproductive fitness.  De Lazari-Radek and Singer
argue, in reply to the objection that their argument takes away the
justification for believing that pain is bad, that there is no
advantage to believing that pain is bad; I am sufficiently motivated
to avoid pain without any such belief (de Lazari-Radek and Singer 2014
268&ndash;269; for the general point, see Parfit 2011 v. 2
527&ndash;30).  The same seems to go for rational egoism: I am
sufficiently motivated to act egoistically without any belief in the
truth of rational egoism.</p>

<h2 id="Conc">4. Conclusion</h2>

<p>

Prospects for psychological egoism are dim.  Even if some version
escapes recent empirical arguments, there seems little reason, once
the traditional philosophical confusions have been noted, for thinking
it is true.  At best it is a logical possibility, like some forms of
scepticism.</p>

<p>

Ethical egoists do best by defending rational egoism instead.</p>

<p>

Rational egoism faces objections from arbitrariness, Nagel, Parfit,
and evolutionary debunking. These worries are not decisive.  Given
this, and given the historical popularity of rational egoism, one
might conclude that it must be taken seriously.  But there is at least
reason to doubt the historical record.  Some philosophers stressed the
connection between moral action and self-interest because they were
concerned with motivation.  It does not follow that self-interest is
for them a normative standard.  And many philosophers may have
espoused rational egoism while thinking that God ensured that acting
morally maximized one&rsquo;s self-interest.  (Some were keen to stress that
virtue must pay <i>in order</i> to give God a role.)  Once this belief
is dropped, it is not so clear what they would have said (Shaver 1999
ch. 4).</p>

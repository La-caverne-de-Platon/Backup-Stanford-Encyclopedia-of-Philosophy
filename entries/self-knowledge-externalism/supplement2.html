<h2>A Problem with Critical Reasoning</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Critical reasoning&rdquo; is reasoning that requires an
awareness of one&rsquo;s reasons for a belief, in order to evaluate
their worth as reasons. Naturally enough, this requires knowledge of
which thoughts are deployed as reasons. The process of evaluating
one&rsquo;s reasons cannot get started without knowing what those
reasons are.</p>

<p>
A concern for Burge&rsquo;s self-verifying judgments is that, even if
they constitute knowledge, they are inadequately informative of
one&rsquo;s reasons. For in brief, self-verifying judgments do not
enable Oscar to avoid simple logical errors in his reasoning, in the
manner we would expect of someone rational. If so, then self-verifying
judgments are at best a &ldquo;hollow&rdquo; kind of self-knowledge,
thus deflating the significance of Burge&rsquo;s compatibilism
(Boghossian 1992a, p. 15).</p>

<p>
As one manifestation of the issue, self-verifying judgments seem
insufficient to reveal whether one&rsquo;s thoughts are inconsistent
(Bilgrami 1992; 2003, Boghossian 1992a; 1994). If so, then critical
reasoning might proceed without the person knowing that her premises
are <em>impossible</em>, despite whatever self-verifying judgments are
at hand. To illustrate, consider that it is possible for someone to
judge rationally:</p>

<blockquote>
(*) Water &ne; H<sub>2</sub>O.
</blockquote>

<p>
For instance, a scientist in 1750 might have reasonably denied the
newly proposed hypothesis is that water is H<sub>2</sub>O. But under
EXT, this judgment is not just false&mdash;it is
 <em>inconsistent</em>.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#supp2-note1" id="ref-1">1</a>]</sup>
 The externalist content of the judgment amounts to: Water is
non-identical with itself. Yet something seems amiss, for the person
is guilty of ignorance, not of gross inconsistency. But how can the
externalist explain that? The best explanation seems to be that the
person was <em>ignorant</em> of the content of (*), and so did not
knowingly flout classical logic. Yet then, SK does not seem true in a
meaningful way, despite whatever self-verifying judgments were
made.</p>

<p>
Instead of inconsistency, the problem can also be put in terms of
Oscar&rsquo;s inability to judge <em>validity</em> from the armchair.
(Boghossian 1992a;
 1994).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#supp2-note2" id="ref-2">2</a>]</sup>
 The difficulty is that self-verifying judgments do not illuminate
whether one thought has the <em>same</em> content as an earlier
thought expressed using the same form of words. Yet if Oscar is unable
to discern &ldquo;same content&rdquo; from the armchair, then he is
unable to know from the armchair if his reasoning is valid. For he is
unable to discern whether his reasoning <em>equivocates</em> between
water thoughts and twin water thoughts.</p>

<p>
There is a well-known example to illustrate the point (Boghossian
1992a; 1994). Suppose Peter is a fan of opera and especially of
Pavarotti, and assume he is slow switched unawares to Twin Earth. He
continues to pursue his interest in opera&mdash;but on Twin Earth, he
is unwittingly reading interviews of, and buying new albums by, Twin
Pavarotti rather than Pavarotti. The problem then arises when memories
of Pavarotti are drawn upon in Peter&rsquo;s reasoning. Suppose he
correctly remembers seeing Pavarotti (on Earth) swim in Lake Taupo.
After the slow-switch, then, suppose he uses the memory as the first
premise in the following argument:</p>

<ol type="i">

<li>Pavarotti once swam in Lake Taupo.</li>

<li>The singer I heard yesterday is Pavarotti.</li>

<li>Hence, the singer I heard yesterday once swam in Lake Taupo.</li>
</ol>

<p>
From Peter&rsquo;s armchair, the reasoning looks perfectly valid. Yet
in fact, &lsquo;Pavarotti&rsquo; in (i) refers to Pavarotti on Earth,
but &lsquo;Pavarotti&rsquo; in (ii) refers to Twin Pavarotti. After
all, (i) expresses a memory of Pavarotti, whereas (ii) expresses a
judgment that is causally connected to Twin Pavarotti. If so, then the
reasoning at (i)-(iii) blatantly equivocates on
&lsquo;Pavarotti&rsquo;, even though Peter is unable to see this from
the armchair.</p>

<p>
The issues are somewhat reminiscent of Kripke&rsquo;s (1979) puzzle
about belief. Recall that Kripke considers a bilingual, Pierre, who is
unaware that &lsquo;Londres&rsquo; co-refers with &lsquo;London&rsquo;
(though is otherwise competent with the terms). Due to happenstance,
Pierre ends up asserting both &lsquo;Londres est jolie&rsquo; and
&lsquo;London is not pretty&rsquo;; the question is then whether the
speaker is guilty of inconsistency. Regardless, Peter&rsquo;s case is
notably different. Whereas Pierre is ignorant of
<em>co</em>-reference, Peter is unaware that his two uses of
&lsquo;Pavarotti&rsquo; in (i) and (ii) have <em>different</em>
referents. Consequently, Peter&rsquo;s case uniquely reveals that,
assuming EXT, Oscar might <em>equivocate</em> in his reasoning even
though he cannot discern this in the armchair. So even granting
self-verifying judgments, EXT may not uphold SK in a sufficiently
robust way. It seems the externalist cannot enable Peter with
armchair-knowledge that his &lsquo;Pavarotti&rsquo;-tokens have
different contents</p>

<p>
It is controversial, however, whether this kind of "transparancy" of
different contents should be allowed. An externalist might instead
dismiss such knowledge as an illusion of the Cartesian paradigm
(Millikan 1984; 1993, Goldberg 1999b; 2007b, Williamson 2000, ch. 4,
Brown 2004, Schroeter 2007). Moreover, even if the externalist can
uphold this "transparancy" of difference, it may still be insufficient
to explain why Peter is not being irrational (Gertler 2015, Wikforss
2015). Regardless, some externalists seek to explain why Peter should
not be rationally criticized for his reasoning.</p>

<p>
A common strategy here is simply to deny that Peter, as a slow switch
victim, refers to different people in (i) versus (ii) (Schiffer 1992;
Burge 1998; Goldberg 2007a). The more natural interpretation may have
&lsquo;Pavarotti&rsquo; denoting Twin Pavarotti in both instances, in
which case, his argument is valid. Of course, this interpretation
means that (i) expresses a false memory. But at least there is no
unnoticed equivocation within the armchair.</p>

<p>
On the other hand, there might be other examples of arguments that
merely appear valid in the armchair, and whose invalidity is not due
to equivocation on the names (Boghossian 1992b). Further, it may be
dubious to see Peter&rsquo;s memory as &ldquo;shifty&rdquo; between
environments&mdash;where (i) comes to express a false memory about
Twin Pavarotti, even though the memory was caused by Pavarotti on
Earth (in the normal way). However, the possibility of a
&ldquo;shifty&rdquo; memory has generated a significant amount of
discussion, in part, because it alone would cut against slow switch
arguments. Further discussion is thus relegated to section
 <a href="index-2.html#Rep3ExtAboMem">3.3</a>.</p>
 
<p>
A different approach is to suggest that Peter tacitly assumes that the
Pavarotti-concept in (i) and the twin-concept in (ii) are
co-referring. Consequently, the reasoning is not a case of
equivocation, but rather one where a false identity-statement is
assumed (Parent 2017, ch 6). Thus, although Peter&rsquo;s reasoning
contains an error, it is not the sort of error that calls his
rationality into question. (Clearly, a fully rational agent can reason
from a false premise unwittingly.) Some have worried that this angle
on Peter leads to a vicious regress of tacit assumptions. For it
requires the concepts in Peter&rsquo;s tacit assumptions, in turn, to
be tacitly interpreted in a particular way (Brown 2004, ch. 5) But the
regress of tacit assumptions might be not vicious; rather, it may be
precisely the right way to understand Peter&rsquo;s cognitive reality
(Parent 2017, ch. 6).</p>

<p>
Yet another proposal is this: Both occurrences of
&lsquo;Pavarotti&rsquo; express concepts that fail to refer
determinately in the first place, due to Peter&rsquo;s confusion on
the matter (Recanati 2012, chs. 10 and 11). Consequently, there is no
unnoticed <em>equivocation</em> in (i)-(iii), since this would assume
that the referent of one &lsquo;Pavarotti&rsquo;-token was
determinately different from the other. But perhaps neither
&lsquo;Pavarotti&rsquo;-token has a determinate referent to begin
with. Arguably, however, this responds to a slightly different problem
than Boghossian&rsquo;s original worry. After all, Boghossian had
stipulated that Peter was slow-switched, meaning it was part of the
set-up that &lsquo;Pavarotti&rsquo; in (ii) determinately refers to
Twin Pavarotti (Parent 2017, p. 139). </p>

<p>
Interestingly, although the critical reasoning objection was initially
posed against Burge&rsquo;s view, it has started to take a life of its
own. The problem can be regarded as a general argument against
compatibilism, since no matter what kind of self-knowledge Peter has,
the externalist is strained to keep separate the logical from the
factual errors in his reasoning. (Even so, the problem with Peter
might conceivably be parlayed into a problem for content internalism
also; P&eacute;rez-Otero 2014, Parent 2017, ch. 6.) </p>

<p>
Regardless, in this setting, some compatibilists respond that the
Peter example misconceives how content is attributed--for the claim is
that &ldquo;content&rdquo; is something we posit to predict/retrodict
the subject&rsquo;s behavior (Stalnaker 2008, Jackman 2015; also cf.
Stalnaker 1990). (The compatibilist here is adopting an interpretivist
view of content, akin to that of Davidson 1973; 1987.) Moreover, it is
held that what &ldquo;adequately explains&rdquo; behavior depends on
the attributor&rsquo;s aims or purposes. Consequently, in one context
(i) might be seen as expressing a false memory about Twin Pavarotti.
That might occur if, e.g., the aim is to explain why Peter talks to
Twin Pavarotti as if they were long-time acquaintances. Yet for
different explanatory purposes, (i) could be interpreted as expressing
a genuine memory about Pavarotti. Our compatibilist holds, moreover,
that <em>either interpretation</em> of Peter can be legitimate, for
there simply is no attributor-independent fact about what mental
contents Peter really has.</p>

<p>
Of course, many would take exception to this attributor-relative view
of content. Some say it is viciously circular to identify
Peter&rsquo;s mental content by what someone attributes to him; after
all, an attribution of content is itself a contentful mental state
(Boghossian 2010; cf. Kriegel 2010). As a second matter, one needs
<em>some</em> constraints on what can be attributed to Peter, yet it
is unclear what these would be (Boghossian 2010). So it remains
unclear whether the &ldquo;interpretivist&rdquo; response to Peter
remains viable.</p>

<h3 id="F1DeriGP">F.1 The Derivation of GP</h3>

<p>
The following is Church&rsquo;s derivation of GP (Grelling&rsquo;s
paradox) within STT plus the axioms for \(D(v, F)\) in the style that
metamathematical arguments are sometimes presented in his text. Only
the spacing of the lines has been changed. The starred numbers refer
to sections of Church&rsquo;s text.</p>

<p>
The antinomy in simple type theory is obtained as follows. We use the
abbreviations &ldquo;P&rdquo;, &ldquo;gen.&rdquo;,
&ldquo;ded.thm.&rdquo;, &ldquo;subst.eq.&rdquo;,
&ldquo;ex.inst.&rdquo;, &ldquo;neg.\(\exists\)&rdquo;, &ldquo;S&rdquo;
to refer to propositional calculus, rule of generalization, deduction
theorem and analogues of *513, *518, *338, *509 in the functional
calculus of higher order.</p>

<p>
By
 <a href="index-2.html#star1">*</a>,</p>
 

\[D(v,F), D(v,\het) \vdash F(x) \equiv_{x} \het (x)\]

<p>
Hence by subst.eq.,</p> 

\[D(v,F), \nsim F(v), D(v,\het) \vdash \nsim \het (v)\]

<p>
Hence by ex.inst. and axiom
 <a href="index-2.html#star3">***</a>,</p>
 
\[\het(v), D(v, \het) \vdash \nsim\het (v)\]

<p>
Hence by ded.thm.,</p> 

\[D(v,\het) \vdash \het(v) \supset \nsim\het(v)\]

<p>
Hence by P,</p> 

\[D(v, \het) \vdash \nsim\het(v)\]

<p>
Hence by the
 <a href="index-2.html#star3">axiom ***</a>,</p>
 
\[D(v, \het) \vdash \nsim(\exists F) \hdot D(v, F) \cdot \nsim F(v)\]

<p>
Hence by the neg.\(\exists\) and P,</p> 

\[D(v, \het) \vdash D(v, F) \supset F F(v)\]

<p>
Hence by S,</p> 

\[D(v, \het) \vdash D(v, \het) \supset \het(v)\]

<p>
Hence by modus ponens,</p> 

\[D(v, \het) \vdash \het(v)\]

<p>
Thus from the hypothesis \(D(v, \het)\) we have a proof both of
\(\nsim\het(v)\) and of \(\het(v)\) Hence by ded.thm. and P,</p>

\[\vdash \nsim D(v, \het)\]

<p>
Hence by gen.,</p> 

\[\vdash(v) \nsim D(v, \het)\]

<p>
Hence by neg.\(\exists\),</p> 

\[\vdash \nsim(\exists v) D(v, \het)\]

<p>
But this contradicts
 <a href="index-2.html#star2">**</a>
 </p>

<h3 id="F2CompTars">F.2 Comparison with Tarski</h3>

<p>
In section 3 of (1976), Church defines \(\stL\) to be the full
ramified language with Val constants defined for every \(r\)-type, but
always of level 1 (&ldquo;predicative&rdquo; in Russell&rsquo;s
terminology). The language \(\rL_n\) results by deleting all variables
of order greater than \(n\) and only allowing variables of order \(n\)
to occur as free variables. The language \(\rL_1\), which is a first
order logic in more or less the usual sense, lacks any Val constants
(since their lowest order is 2), and only individual variables are
quantified. The language \(\rL_2\), like ordinary second order logic
allows quantifiers to bind first order predicate and propositional
variables, but there are also predicates of first order predicates
representing propositional functions of level 2, and these are not
bindable variables. This yields a hierarchy of languages, \(\rL_1\),
\(\rL_2\),&hellip;, \(\rL_{n+1}\),&hellip;, indexed by positive
integers, where each subsequent language serves as a semantical
meta-language for the previous one. Church comments that it is merely
matter of terminology whether \(\stL\) is regarded as a hierarchy of
orders or as an infinite sequence of languages. But he goes on to
stress that Tarski&rsquo;s resolution of the semantical antinomies
simply requires that the semantical predicates must belong in the
meta-language and hence Russell&rsquo;s resolution of, e.g.,
Grelling&rsquo;s paradox may be viewed as a special case of
Tarski&rsquo;s. To bolster this conclusion Church shows how truth and
satisfaction may be defined within the system of orders, and after
adding the axioms reducibility, he derives a version of Tarski&rsquo;s
theorem about truth.</p>

<h3 id="F3ReduDefiTrut">F.3 Reducibility, Definability and Truth</h3>

<p>
The structure of the \(r\)-types and the associated ban on
impredicative definitions excludes many principles required for the
standard theories of natural and real numbers, as well as higher set
theory; and to remedy this problem, Russell proposed the axioms of
reducibility, defined for each distinct type, whereby propositional
functions of higher order are guaranteed to be provably equivalent to
propositional functions of the first level (in every type). Russell
called these &ldquo;first order&rdquo; or &ldquo;predicative&rdquo;
functions. Reducibility solves the mathematical problem&mdash;but
Church&rsquo;s focus in (1976) is on GP and the question whether
reducibility together with the semantical principles regarding
<em>Val</em> allows the resurgence of GP. In what follows we continue
to trade in Val for the slightly simpler, but for present purposes,
equally general, \(D\), but we return to Val when necessary.</p>

<p>
Reducibility implies that there is a propositional function of level 1
that is provably equivalent to het of a fixed arbitrary level, as
defined by
 <a href="index-2.html#star4">****</a>
 in the text:</p> 

\[\tag{12&prime;} 
(\exists H^{1/1}) \hdot H(v) \equiv v (\exists F^{1/n}) D(v, F) \cdot \nsim F(v).\]

<p>
No contradiction is forthcoming from this, even with the help of
predicative counterparts of (6&prime;) and (7&prime;), unless it is
possible to establish <em>in addition</em> that <em>some word</em> (of
whatever level) <em>denotes</em> a first level propositional function
equivalent to het (of whatever level).</p> 

\[\tag{8&prime;} 
(\exists v)(\exists G^{1/1}) D^{m+2}(v, G) \hdot G(x) \equiv_{x} \het^{m+1}(x).\]

<p>
As Church remarks, the formal counterpart of this, (8) of (1976),
formulated in terms of Val does not seem to be forthcoming merely by
the addition of reducibility; and the same seems to be true of the
version (8&prime;) in terms of \(D\). Hence, it doesn&rsquo;t seem
that GP is derivable in the system. But this is no proof that it
isn&rsquo;t, and so Church concludes only that &ldquo;This is an
empiric justification of the axioms of reducibility, based on the
failure of the direct attempt to restore Grelling&rsquo;s antinomy by
means of them (1976 [BE:. 805]).</p>

<p>
Cantor&rsquo;s theorem in the form CL discussed above in connection
with GP, is obviously relevant here, (but Church makes no mention of
it). The condition that some word, v, denotes het (in the sense that
\(D(v, \het)\) holds) is equivalent to the condition that het is in
the range of \(D\), assuming that \(D\) is a well-defined function
with a well-defined domain and range. (It could be a function from
words as individuals to the extensions of unary propositional
functions of level 1.) CL then implies that het cannot be in the range
of \(D\), since het is the diagonal function determined by \(D\). That
is, het consists of those words that do not have the properties they
denote. But when it comes down to it, the semantical notion of
denotation is not doing the work here. Any function that takes words
to properties or words to sets can formally replace \(D.\) For
example, a function that takes words to numbers would work as well. We
cannot have a word for het, not because we cannot invent names for
definite things in our midst (compare
 <a href="index-2.html#star2">**</a>),
 but because of how het is defined in terms of \(D.\) It&rsquo;s
possible to have a word for het, just not one for which \(D\) is
defined.</p>

<p>
In the last paragraphs of (1976) Church makes some similar remarks
about het (without mentioning Cantor&rsquo;s theorem) and draws some
conclusions concerning the Tarski hierarchy of
languages/metalanguages. He notes that in the system with Val and
reducibility, we have:</p> 

\[\tag{14} G^{1/1}(x) \equiv_{x} \het^{ n+1}(x) \supset_{avG} \nsim \val^{2}(a,v,G)\] 

\[\tag{15} (\exists G^{1/1}) \hdot G(x) \equiv_{x} \het^{n+1}(x).\]

<p>
He remarks that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The principle significance of theorems (14) and (15) is that there
must be, among the values of the variables in \(\rL_1\) of \(r\)-type
\(1/1\), propositional functions such that no coextensive function is
expressible by a propositional form in \(\rL_1\), but only in some
language arbitrarily far along in the hierarchy \(\rL_1\) ,
\(\rL_2\),&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus, he takes these two theorems to imply a basic definability result
related to Tarski&rsquo;s theorem (see the next paragraph and n. 26 of
1976). (15) asserts that given het of an arbitrary level, \(n+1\),
there is a propositional function of level 1 coextensive with it; and
this combined with (14) entails:</p> 

\[\nsim \val^{2}(a,v,G),\]

<p>
which says that the &ldquo;propositional form&rdquo; (open sentence),
\(v\), does not express \(G\). Putting \(D\) for Val in (14), the
result is just further confirmation that there can be no word for het,
since</p> 

\[\nsim D(v, G),\]

<p>
asserts that the arbitrarily chosen word, \(v\), does not denote the
first level propositional function, \(G\). Any word for \(G\) can be
present only in some language farther along in the hierarchy of
sublanguages of \(\stL\).</p>

<h3 id="F4TarsTheo">F.4 Tarski&rsquo;s Theorem</h3>

<p>
Church points out that this result concerning (14) and (15) &ldquo;is
to be expected in light of Tarski&rsquo;s theorem about truth&rdquo;,
and in note 28 towards the end of (1976), he indicates how a form of
that theorem can be obtained for \(\rL_1\).</p>

<p>
For the following, it is best to keep in mind that unlike familiar
uninterpreted first order languages, \(\rL_1\) is a fully interpreted
language. For example, the individual variables and unary predicates
of \(\rL_1\) range over the already fixed objects of type i and (i)
respectively. The following wff of L2 is Church&rsquo;s definition of
truth for propositions of order 1&mdash;the propositions expressed by
wff of type 0 of \(\rL_1\):</p> 

\[\Tr^{2} (v) \rightarrow(\exists p^{0/1} ) \hdot \val^{2} (v,p) \cdot p,\]

<p>
Now replace \(\het(x)\) in each of (14) and (15) by the predicate
\(\Tr^{2} (v)\) (a predicate of \(\rL_2\)). Assuming that \(\rL_1\)
and \(\rL_2\) are consistent and that \(\Tr^{2} (v)\) is true of
exactly the true sentences of \(\rL_1\), (15), so altered, asserts
that there must be a propositional function in range of the unary
propositional functions of \(\rL_1\) that is coextensive with
\(\Tr^{2} (v)\), if that range is to be &ldquo;extensionally
complete&rdquo; (1976; n. 26); but this together with (14), so
altered, entails that no propositional form of \(\rL_1\) in one free
variable has the same extension as \(\Tr^{2} (v)\). (Recall that the
<em>sentences</em> of \(\rL_1\), like all sentences, are individuals,
so they can be values of \(v\).) This is essentially Tarski&rsquo;s
theorem. In the second paragraph, Church stresses that (14) and (15)
imply not only the indefinability of the extensional \(\Tr^{2} (v)\)
but also of the intensional \(\het(x)\), and he hints that other
semantical notions will turn out to be similarly indefinable.</p>

<p>
Much of foregoing is prefigured in Church&rsquo;s review (1950c) of a
paper of Irving Copi&rsquo;s claiming that RTT with reducibility is
either inconsistent or redundant. But Copi assumes that it is possible
without ado to add a name for the property of heterologicality to RTT
and Church remarks that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
To this it seems that the authors of Principia, at the time of the
publication of their first edition, might have replied simply that
from the existence of properties of a certain kind it does not
necessarily follow that a particular such property can be named.
(1950c: 221)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Church&rsquo;s view seems to be no word for het can be a member of the
domain of \(D\) and no propositional form expressing het can be in the
domain of Val.</p>

<p>
In a final footnote of (1976), Church considers strengthening the
system by adding principles (strengthening (4) and (11) to
biconditionals) that seem to say that if a function is expressible (or
nameable, as per \(D)\) anywhere in the hierarchy, it is expressible
(nameable) everywhere; and he thinks that this may result in a
violation of Tarski&rsquo;s resolution of the paradoxes. He
nevertheless conjectures that the resulting system would be
consistent.</p>

<p>
Finally, we note that much earlier than (1976), in the hitherto
unpublished (1949b), Church gives a demonstration of the derivability
of GP within the elegant system (1940) of STT with axioms defining a
denotation predicate. Church&rsquo;s argument uses the devices of
G&ouml;del numbering and lambda abstraction, but it is essentially the
same argument we have outlined above using a simpler language. But it
is important to note that as regards <em>just</em> the derivation of
Grelling&rsquo;s paradox in STT, all of the account given in (1976)
and in (1995a) was already available in (1949b). However, the
important indefinability result of (1976), using the axioms of
reducibility, is not present in (1949b). Nevertheless, Church (1949b)
notes the similarity of his derivation of GP within STT and
Tarski&rsquo;s use of the liar paradox to derive the theorem on truth.
In fact, from the contradiction resulting from Grelling&rsquo;s
paradox, Church (1949b) concludes that no word denotes the property of
being heterological. This result is obtained without the help of
reducibility since the underlying system is STT rather than RTT.</p>

<h3 id="F5ChurFormAnalRM">F.5 Church&rsquo;s Formal Analysis of RM</h3>

<p>
Church adds a symbol, here represented by \(\sequiv\), for
propositional identity and gives fifteen axioms and schemata
providing, he insists, exactly what is required to derive RM in STT
with \(\sequiv\). In order to give a brief reconstruction of
Church&rsquo;s derivation, we will allow propositions of the form
<em>proposition \(p\) is in the class \(m\)</em> to play the role
usually played by propositions of the form <em>every proposition in
\(m\) is true.</em> This allows us in principle to dispense with seven
of the axioms. (Church notes this is possible.) We also leave the
relevant comprehension principles ((5) and (6) of Church paper
unstated. Church prefaces each step of his derivation with a sentence
from Russell&rsquo;s informally stated argument in Appendix B of
<em>Principles of Mathematics</em>, so that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
what is being done is not a later imposition upon Russell of something
he would not have recognized as his own thought. (1984 [BE: 817])</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This wonderful detail must be omitted from the following.</p>

<p>
The complications of Church&rsquo;s presentation stem mainly from his
desire to reduce Russell&rsquo;s assumption that identical
propositions must have identical constituents to its simplest terms.
At one point, Church formulates this principle as a metalinguistic
semantical principle concerning names&mdash;that names of different
things give rise to sentences that express different propositions
(1984 [BE: 819]), but his formalization does not rely on this
principle. Instead, Structure is represented in the object language
(Church&rsquo;s 1a and 1b) asserting that if the proposition that
<em>every proposition in \(m\) is true</em> is the same as the
proposition that <em>every proposition in \(n\) is true</em>, then
\(n\) and \(m\) are coextensive. In terms of the simpler propositions
of the form <em>\(p\) is in \(m\)</em>, the corresponding principle is
the following:</p> 

\[\tag{1} \nsim(q) [ n(q) \equiv m(q)] \supset (p)(q) \nsim [n(p) \sequiv m(q)] \]

<p>
which asserts that if \(n\) and \(m\) are not coextensive, then the
propositions \(n(p)\) and \(m(q)\) are never the same; or the
contrapositive: if for some \(p\) and \(q\), \(n(p)\) and \(m(q)\) are
the same, then \(m\) and \(n\) are coextensive. Church gives a
separate proof from his axioms of (his version of) (1) using his
axioms 3, 8 and 11. It is not clear that the same holds for the
present version. Now, following Church&rsquo;s steps 2 and 3 gives:
(The bold type indicates the special role of \(\stw\) and \(\stp 0\)
in the argument as emerges in the resolution of the paradox in terms
of RTT. See below.)</p> 

\[\tag{2} \stw(r) \equiv_r (\exists m)(\exists q) [r \sequiv m(q) \cdot \nsim m(r)]\] \[\tag{3} \stp 0 \sequiv \stw(s)\]

<p>
where s is any fixed proposition. (2) and (3) are hypotheses that are
later discharged using the comprehension principles. That is, the
existence of \(\stw\) and \(\stp 0\) is guaranteed by those
principles. It is now possible to derive that \(\stp 0\) and \(\nsim
\stp 0\) using the seemingly weak principle 1 and some of the other
axioms. Assuming that \(\stw(\stp 0)\), infer \(\stw(s) \sequiv m(q)
\cdot \nsim m(\stw(s))\). Then for \(p' = \stw(s)\) and \(q' = m(q)\),
the negation of the consequent of (1) is satisfied and hence by
contraposition, \(\stw\) and \(m\) are coextensive. So since \(\nsim
m(\stw(s))\), by (3), \(\nsim m(\stp 0)\), and it follows that \(\nsim
w(\stp 0)\). (The argument relies on Church&rsquo;s axiom 3, which
gives propositional identity the usual properties of identity.) The
proof from the assumption that \(\nsim \stw(\stp 0)\) proceeds as
usual. The Structure principle, (1), is not needed for this. The
righthand side of (2) is satisfied by \(\stw\) and \(\stp 0\) and
hence \(w(\stp 0)\).</p>

<p>
One might wonder why Church engaged in this more or less routine
exercise. One important reason is that he thought that Russell&rsquo;s
structured propositions are needed in a Russellian (as opposed to a
Fregean) analysis of statements of assertion and belief:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If following the early Russell, we hold that the object of an
assertion or of a belief is a proposition and then impose on
propositions the strong conditions of identity which this
requires&hellip;we therefore find no alternative except ramified type
theory, with axioms of reducibility, and with axioms and axiom
schemata 1&ndash;15 appropriately modified. (1984 [BE: 821)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Church observes that &ldquo;the antinomy is immediately resolved by
ramified type theory&rdquo; and, moreover, that there is no reason to
suppose that it is restored by reducibility (1984 [BE: 821]). RTT
requires that in (2), \(\stw\) must be of higher order than the
quantified variable m and so the required equality of \(\stw\) and
\(m\) is lost. Likewise, \(\stp 0\) must be of higher order than
\(m(q)\) and so the required identity of the latter two is lost. In
the last paragraphs, Church indicates how the axioms might be
appropriately modified within the system of \(r\)-types of (1976) with
reducibility.</p>

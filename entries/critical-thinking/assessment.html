<h2>Assessment</h2>

<p>
How can one assess, for purposes of instruction or research, the
degree to which a person possesses the dispositions, skills and
knowledge of a critical thinker?</p>

<p>
In psychometrics, assessment instruments are judged according to their
validity and reliability.</p>

<p>
Roughly speaking, an instrument is valid if it measures accurately
what it purports to measure, given standard conditions. More
precisely, the degree of validity is &ldquo;the degree to which
evidence and theory support the interpretations of test scores for
proposed uses of tests&rdquo; (American Educational Research
Association 2014: 11). In other words, a test is not valid or invalid
in itself. Rather, validity is a property of an interpretation of a
given score on a given test for a specified use. Determining the
degree of validity of such an interpretation requires collection and
integration of the relevant evidence, which may be based on test
content, test takers&rsquo; response processes, a test&rsquo;s
internal structure, relationship of test scores to other variables,
and consequences of the interpretation (American Educational Research
Association 2014: 13&ndash;21). Criterion-related evidence consists of
correlations between scores on the test and performance on another
test of the same construct; its weight depends on how well supported
is the assumption that the other test can be used as a criterion.
Content-related evidence is evidence that the test covers the full
range of abilities that it claims to test. Construct-related evidence
is evidence that a correct answer reflects good performance of the
kind being measured and an incorrect answer reflects poor
performance.</p>

<p>
An instrument is reliable if it consistently produces the same result,
whether across different forms of the same test (parallel-forms
reliability), across different items (internal consistency), across
different administrations to the same person (test-retest
reliability), or across ratings of the same answer by different people
(inter-rater reliability). Internal consistency should be expected
only if the instrument purports to measure a single undifferentiated
construct, and thus should not be expected of a test that measures a
suite of critical thinking dispositions or critical thinking
abilities, assuming that some people are better in some of the
respects measured than in others (for example, very willing to inquire
but rather closed-minded). Otherwise, reliability is a necessary but
not a sufficient condition of validity; a standard example of a
reliable instrument that is not valid is a bathroom scale that
consistently under-reports a person&rsquo;s weight.</p>

<p>
Assessing dispositions is difficult if one uses a multiple-choice
format with known adverse consequences of a low score. It is pretty
easy to tell what answer to the question &ldquo;How open-minded are
you?&rdquo; will get the highest score and to give that answer, even
if one knows that the answer is incorrect. If an item probes less
directly for a critical thinking disposition, for example by asking
how often the test taker pays close attention to views with which the
test taker disagrees, the answer may differ from reality because of
self-deception or simple lack of awareness of one&rsquo;s personal
thinking style, and its interpretation is problematic, even if factor
analysis enables one to identify a distinct factor measured by a group
of questions that includes this one (Ennis 1996). Nevertheless,
Facione, S&aacute;nchez, and Facione (1994) used this approach to
develop the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory
(CCTDI). They began with 225 statements expressive of a disposition
towards or away from critical thinking (using the long list of
dispositions in Facione 1990a), validated the statements with
talk-aloud and conversational strategies in focus groups to determine
whether people in the target population understood the items in the
way intended, administered a pilot version of the test with 150 items,
and eliminated items that failed to discriminate among test takers or
were inversely correlated with overall results or added little
refinement to overall scores (Facione 2000). They used item analysis
and factor analysis to group the measured dispositions into seven
broad constructs: open-mindedness, analyticity, cognitive maturity,
truth-seeking, systematicity, inquisitiveness, and self-confidence
(Facione, S&aacute;nchez, and Facione 1994). The resulting test
consists of 75 agree-disagree statements and takes 20 minutes to
administer. A repeated disturbing finding is that North American
students taking the test tend to score low on the truth-seeking
sub-scale (on which a low score results from agreeing to such
statements as the following: &ldquo;To get people to agree with me I
would give any reason that worked&rdquo;. &ldquo;Everyone always
argues from their own self-interest, including me&rdquo;. &ldquo;If
there are four reasons in favor and one against, I&rsquo;ll go with
the four&rdquo;.) Development of the CCTDI made it possible to test
whether good critical thinking abilities and good critical thinking
dispositions go together, in which case it might be enough to teach
one without the other. Facione (2000) reports that administration of
the CCTDI and the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST) to
almost 8,000 post-secondary students in the United States revealed a
statistically significant but weak correlation between total scores on
the two tests, and also between paired sub-scores from the two tests.
The implication is that both abilities and dispositions need to be
taught, that one cannot expect improvement in one to bring with it
improvement in the other.</p>

<p>
A more direct way of assessing critical thinking dispositions would be
to see what people do when put in a situation where the dispositions
would reveal themselves. Ennis (1996) reports promising initial work
with guided open-ended opportunities to give evidence of dispositions,
but no standardized test seems to have emerged from this work. There
are however standardized aspect-specific tests of critical thinking
dispositions. The Critical Problem Solving Scale (Berman et al. 2001:
518) takes as a measure of the disposition to suspend judgment the
number of distinct good aspects attributed to an option judged to be
the worst among those generated by the test taker. Stanovich, West and
Toplak (2011: 800&ndash;810) list tests developed by cognitive
psychologists of the following dispositions: resistance to miserly
information processing, resistance to myside thinking, absence of
irrelevant context effects in decision-making, actively open-minded
thinking, valuing reason and truth, tendency to seek information,
objective reasoning style, tendency to seek consistency, sense of
self-efficacy, prudent discounting of the future, self-control skills,
and emotional regulation.</p>

<p>
It is easier to measure critical thinking skills or abilities than to
measure dispositions. The following eight currently available
standardized tests purport to measure them: the Watson-Glaser Critical
Thinking Appraisal (Watson &amp; Glaser 1980a, 1980b, 1994), the
Cornell Critical Thinking Tests Level X and Level Z (Ennis &amp;
Millman 1971; Ennis, Millman, &amp; Tomko 1985, 2005), the Ennis-Weir
Critical Thinking Essay Test (Ennis &amp; Weir 1985), the California
Critical Thinking Skills Test (Facione 1990b, 1992), the Halpern
Critical Thinking Assessment (Halpern 2016), the Critical Thinking
Assessment Test (Center for Assessment &amp; Improvement of Learning
2017) and the Collegiate Learning Assessment (Council for Aid to
Education 2017). The Critical Thinking Assessment Test (CAT) is unique
among them in being designed for use by college faculty to help them
improve their development of students&rsquo; critical thinking skills
(Haynes et al. 2015). Also, for some years the United Kingdom body OCR
(Oxford Cambridge and RSA Examinations) awarded AS and A Level
certificates in critical thinking on the basis of an examination (OCR
2011). Many of these standardized tests have received scholarly
evaluations at the hands of, among others, Ennis (1958), McPeck
(1981), Norris and Ennis (1989), Fisher and Scriven (1997), and Possin
(2008, 2013a, 2013b, 2014). Their evaluations provide a useful set of
criteria that such tests ideally should meet, as does the description
by Ennis (1984) of problems in testing for competence in critical
thinking: the soundness of multiple-choice items, the clarity and
soundness of instructions to test takers, the information and mental
processing used in selecting an answer to a multiple-choice item, the
role of background beliefs and ideological commitments in selecting an
answer to a multiple-choice item, the tenability of a test&rsquo;s
underlying conception of critical thinking and its component
abilities, the set of abilities that the test manual claims are
covered by the test, the extent to which the test actually covers
these abilities, the appropriateness of the weighting given to various
abilities in the scoring system, the accuracy and intellectual honesty
of the test manual, the interest of the test to the target population
of test takers, the scope for guessing, the scope for choosing a keyed
answer by being test-wise, precautions against cheating in the
administration of the test, clarity and soundness of materials for
training essay graders, inter-rater reliability in grading essays, and
clarity and soundness of advance guidance to test takers on what is
required in an essay.</p>

<p>
There are also aspect-specific standardized tests of critical thinking
abilities. Stanovich, West and Toplak (2011: 800&ndash;810) list tests
of probabilistic reasoning, insights into qualitative decision theory,
knowledge of scientific reasoning, rules of logical consistency and
validity, and economic thinking. They also list tests of irrational
thinking, such as superstitious thinking, belief in the superiority of
intuition, overreliance on folk wisdom and folk psychology, belief in
&ldquo;special&rdquo; expertise, financial misconceptions,
overestimation of one&rsquo;s introspective powers, dysfunctional
beliefs, and a notion of self that encourages egocentric processing.
They regard these tests along with the previously mentioned tests of
critical thinking dispositions as the building blocks for a
comprehensive test of rationality, whose development (they write) may
be logistically difficult and would require millions of dollars.</p>

<p>
A model of assessment of an aspect of critical thinking ability is the
Test on Appraising Observations (Norris &amp; King 1983, 1985, 1990a,
1990b), which was designed for classroom administration to senior high
school students. The test focuses entirely on the ability to appraise
observation statements and in particular on the ability to determine
in a specified context which of two statements there is more reason to
believe. According to the test manual (Norris &amp; King 1985, 1990b),
a person&rsquo;s score on the multiple-choice version of the test,
which is the number of items that are answered correctly, can
justifiably be given either a criterion-referenced or a
norm-referenced interpretation.</p>

<p>
On a criterion-referenced interpretation, those who do well on the
test have a firm grasp of the principles for appraising observation
statements, and those who do poorly have a weak grasp of them. This
interpretation can be justified by the content of the test and the way
it was developed, which incorporated a method of controlling for
background beliefs articulated and defended by Norris (1985). Norris
and King synthesized from judicial practice, psychological research
and common-sense psychology 31 principles for appraising observation
statements, in the form of empirical generalizations about tendencies,
such as the principle that observation statements tend to be more
believable than inferences based on them (Norris &amp; King 1984).
They constructed items in which exactly one of the 31 principles
determined which of two statements was more believable. Using a
carefully constructed protocol, they interviewed about 100 students
who responded to these items in order to determine the thinking that
led them to choose the answers they did (Norris &amp; King 1984). In
several iterations of the test, they adjusted items so that selection
of the correct answer generally reflected good thinking and selection
of an incorrect answer reflected poor thinking. Thus they have good
evidence that good performance on the test is due to good thinking
about observation statements and that poor performance is due to poor
thinking about observation statements. Collectively, the 50 items on
the final version of the test require application of 29 of the 31
principles for appraising observation statements, with 13 principles
tested by one item, 12 by two items, three by three items, and one by
four items. Thus there is comprehensive coverage of the principles for
appraising observation statements. Fisher and Scriven (1997:
135&ndash;136) judge the items to be well worked and sound, with one
exception. The test is clearly written at a grade 6 reading level,
meaning that poor performance cannot be attributed to difficulties in
reading comprehension by the intended adolescent test takers. The
stories that frame the items are realistic, and are engaging enough to
stimulate test takers&rsquo; interest. Thus the most plausible
explanation of a given score on the test is that it reflects roughly
the degree to which the test taker can apply principles for appraising
observations in real situations. In other words, there is good
justification of the proposed interpretation that those who do well on
the test have a firm grasp of the principles for appraising
observation statements and those who do poorly have a weak grasp of
them.</p>

<p>
To get norms for performance on the test, Norris and King arranged for
seven groups of high school students in different types of communities
and with different levels of academic ability to take the test. The
test manual includes percentiles, means, and standard deviations for
each of these seven groups. These norms allow teachers to compare the
performance of their class on the test to that of a similar group of
students.</p>

<h2>Appendix 2: The Discovery of CP Violation: A Persuasive Experiment</h2>

<p>

A group at Princeton University, led by Cronin and Fitch, decided to
test CP conservation. The experimenters were quite aware of the
relevance of their experiment to the question of CP violation, but they
did not expect to observe it. As Val Fitch, one of the group leaders
remarked, &ldquo;Not many of our colleagues would have given credit for
studying CP invariance, but we did so anyway&rdquo; (Fitch 1981, p. 991). A
preliminary estimate indicated that the CP phase of the experiment
would detect about 7500 \(\ce{K2^0}\) decays and thus
reduce the limit on CP violation from the then current limit of 1/300
(0.3%) to 1/7500 (For details of this episode see Franklin (1986, Ch.
3)).</p>

<p>

The experimental beam contained only \(\ce{K2^0}\)
mesons. (The \(\ce{K1^0}\) meson has a much shorter
lifetime than the \(\ce{K2^0}\) meson, so that if we start
with a beam containing both types of particles, after a time only the
\(\ce{K2^0}\) mesons will remain). The experimental
apparatus detected two charged particles from the decay of the
\(\ce{K2^0}\) meson. The vector momentum of each
of the two decay products from the \(\ce{K2^0}\) beam and
the invariant mass \(m^*\) were computed assuming that each
product had the mass of a pion:</p>

\[
m^* = [(E_1 + E_2)^2 - (\bp_1 + \bp_2)^2]^{\bfrac{1}{2}},
\]

<p>

where E and \(\bp\) are the energy and vector momenta of
the pions, respectively. If both particles were indeed pions from
\(\ce{K2^0}\) decay, \(m^*\) would equal the
\(\ce{K2^0}\) mass. The experimenters also computed the
vector sum of the two momenta and the angle between this sum and the
direction of the \(\ce{K2^0}\) beam. This angle should be
zero for two-body decays, but not, in general, for three-body
decays.</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>

This was exactly what the Princeton group observed (Christenson et
al. 1964). As seen clearly in Figure 3,
there is a peak at the 
\(\ce{K^0}\) mass, 498 MeV/c<sup>2</sup>, for
events with \(\cos(\theta)\) greater than 0.9999 (\(\cos(\theta)\)
approximately equal to 1 means \(\theta\) is approximately equal to 0). No
such peak is seen in the mass regions just above or just below the
\(\ce{K^0}\) mass. The experimenters reported a total of \(45\pm 9\)
two-pion \(\ce{K2^0}\) decays out of a total of 22,700
\(\ce{K2^0}\) decays. This was a branching ratio of 
\((1.95\pm 0.2) \times 10^{-3}\), or approximately 0.2 percent.</p>

<p>

The most obvious interpretation of the Princeton result was that CP
symmetry was violated. This was the view taken in three out of four
theoretical papers written during the period immediately following the
report of that result. The Princeton result had persuaded most of the
physics community that CP symmetry was violated. The remaining
theoretical papers offered alternative
 explanations.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A2-1" name="note-A2-1">1</a>]</sup>
 These alternatives relied on one or
more of three arguments: (1) the Princeton results are caused by a CP
asymmetry (the local preponderance of matter over antimatter) in the
environment of the experiment, (2) 
\(\ce{K2^0}\) decay into
two pions does not necessarily imply CP violation, and ( 3) the
Princeton observations did not arise from two-pion
\(\ce{K2^0}\) decay. This last argument can divided into
the assertions that (3a) the decaying particle was not a
\(\ce{K2^0}\) meson, (3b) the decay products were not
pions, and (3c) another unobserved particle was emitted in the decay.
Included in these alternatives were three suggestions that cast doubt
on well-supported fundamental assumptions of modern physics. These
were: (1) pions are not bosons, (2) the principle of superposition in
quantum mechanics is violated, and (3) the exponential decay law fails.
Although by the end of 1967 all of these alternatives had been
experimentally tested and found wanting, the majority of the physics
community had accepted CP violation by the end of 1965, even though all
the tests had not yet been completed. As Prentki, a theoretical
particle physicist, remarked, this was because in some cases &ldquo;the price
one has to pay in order to save CP becomes extremely high,&rdquo; and because
other alternatives were &ldquo;even more unpleasant&rdquo; (Prentki 1965).</p>

<p>

This is an example of what one might call a pragmatic solution to
the Duhem-Quine
 problem.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A2-2" name="note-A2-2">2</a>]</sup>
The alternative explanations and the auxiliary hypotheses were refuted,
leaving CP violation unprotected. One might worry that other plausible
alternatives were never suggested or considered. This is not a serious
problem in the actual practice of physics. No fewer than ten
alternative explanations of the Princeton result were offered, and not
all of them were very plausible. Had others been suggested they, too,
would have been considered by the physics community. Consider the model
of Nishijima and Saffouri (1965). They explained two-pion
\(\ce{K2^0}\) decay by the existence of a &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; universe
in touch with our &ldquo;real&rdquo; universe only through the weak interactions.
They attributed to the two pion decay observed to the decay of the
\(\ce{K^0}\) from the shadow universe. This implausible model was not
merely considered, it was also experimentally tested. Everett (1965)
noted that if the \(\ce{K^0}\), the shadow \(\ce{K^0}\) postulated
by Nishijima and Saffouri existed, then a shadow pion should also
exist, and the decays of the \(\ce{K+}\) into a positive 
pion and a neutral pion and of the \(\ce{K+}\)
into a positive pion and a
neutral shadow pion and should occur with equal rates. The presence of
the shadow pion could be detected by measuring the ordinary 
\(\ce{K+}\) branching ratio in two different experiments, one in which
the neutral pion was detected and one in which it was not. If the
shadow pion existed the two measurements would differ. They didn&rsquo;t.
There was no shadow pion and thus, no \(\KOp\)</p>

<p>

What was the difference between the episodes of parity
nonconservation and CP violation. In the former parity nonconservation
was immediately accepted. No alternative explanations were offered.
There was a convincing and decisive set of experiments. In the latter
at least ten alternatives were proposed, and although CP violation was
accepted rather quickly, the alternatives were tested. In both cases
there are only two classes of theories, those that conserve parity or
CP, and those that do not. The difference lies in the length and
complexity of the derivation linking the hypothesis to the experimental
result, or to the number of auxiliary hypotheses required for the
derivation. In the case of parity nonconservation the experiment could
be seen by inspection to violate mirror symmetry (See
 <a href="app1.html#fig1">Figure 1</a>).
 In the CP episode what was observed
was \(\ce{K2^0}\) decay into two pions. In order to connect
this observation to CP conservation one had to assume (1) the principle
of superposition, (2) that the exponential decay law held to 300
lifetimes, (3) that the decay particles were both &ldquo;real&rdquo; pions and that
pions were bosons, (4) that no other particle was emitted in the decay,
(5) that no other similar particle was produced, and (6) that there
were no external conditions present that might regenerate
\(\ce{K1^0}\) mesons. It was these auxiliary assumptions
that were tested and eliminated as alternative explanations by
subsequent experiments.</p>

<p>

The discovery of CP violation called for a theoretical explanation,
a call that is still unanswered.</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Martin Luther</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a> Research on the wider cultural significance of that upbringing and education has been summarized by Nicholas Boyle: 
</p><blockquote><p>
It has been calculated that, even excluding philosophers, 120 major literary figures writing in German and born between 1676 and 1804 had either studied theology or were the children of Protestant pastors. (Boyle 2008: 10.)</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a> &ldquo;A Scurrilous Attack Evokes a Response&rdquo;, 1538,  WA TR 3 no 3838/LW 54: 282:
</p><blockquote><p>
I confess I&rsquo;m the son of a peasant from M&ouml;hra, near Eisenach, but in spite of this I&rsquo;m a doctor of the Holy Scriptures and an opponent of the pope.
</p></blockquote><p>
Thomas Carlyle was later to use Luther&rsquo;s supposedly humble origins to draw obvious Biblical comparisons: 
</p><blockquote><p>
I find it altogether suitable to Luther&rsquo;s function on this Earth, and doubtless wisely ordered to that end by the Providence presiding over him and us and all things, that he was born poor, and brought up poor, one of the poorest of men. (Carlyle 1841 [1983: 156])</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a> See Steinmetz 1980 for a discussion of the relation between Luther and Staupitz. For a general discussion of the intellectual context of this period, see Heiko A. Oberman 1977 [1981].</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
Cf. <em>Against the Antinomians</em> 1539, WA 50:473/LW 47:113:
&ldquo;Good heavens, I should at least be left in peace by my own
people! It is enough to be harassed by the papists.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a> Luther&rsquo;s relation to Erasmus and humanism more generally is complex: for some useful discussion, see Trinkaus 1999 and Rex 2017b.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a> Thesis 13 of the <em>Heidelberg Dissertation</em> reads: </p><blockquote><p>
Free will, after the Fall, exists in name only, and as long as it does what it is able to do, it commits a mortal sin. (WA 1:354/LW 31:40)
</p></blockquote><p>
 Erasmus responds to Luther&rsquo;s comments on freedom in his
 reply to article 36 of <em>Exsurge Domine</em> in <em>Assertio omnimum articulorum
 M. Lutheri per bullam Leonis X. novissimam damnatorum</em>: see WA
 7:142&ndash;9, translated in Erasmus 1999, 76: 300&ndash;10; see also the German version published in
 1521, <em>Grund und Ursach aller Artikel D. Martin Luthers</em>,  WA 7:444&ndash;450/LW 32:92&ndash;4.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a> Erasmus&rsquo;s title is multi-layered, as Smith (2011: 24 note 2) observes: 
</p><blockquote><p>
The very title, &ldquo;Hyperaspistes&rdquo;, gives an indication of the kind of philological play and bitter sarcasm that often permeated these exchanges. The term derives from the adjective meaning &ldquo;protected by a shield&rdquo; and implies that the work is Erasmus&rsquo;s self defense. However, there is more to the term than that. Luther had occasionally referred to Erasmus as a &ldquo;viper&rdquo; (vipera in Latin, &#7936;&sigma;&pi;&#943;&sigmaf; in Greek), and Erasmus seems to imply that he is playing the role of a &ldquo;super snake&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<p>
See also the note on the title in Erasmus 1526 [1999: 96].
</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a> <em>On the Jews and Their Lies</em>, <em>On the Ineffable Name and on the Lineage of Christ</em>, and <em>On the Last Words of David</em> were all published in 1543, while Luther&rsquo;s sermon from February 1546 was published posthumously as <em>Admonition Against the Jews.</em> For further discussion of Luther&rsquo;s polemics against the Jews, placing it in a wider context, see Helmer 2019: Chapter 5. For a selection of relevant texts, and helpful introductory essays, see Schramm, Brooks, and Stejerna (eds.) 2012.</p>
</div>


<div id="note-9">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a> See Church Postils WA 10.1&ndash;1:531: 
</p><blockquote><p>
In temporal, human affairs human judgment suffices. For these things we need no light but that of reason. Hence God does not in the Scriptures teach us how to build houses, to make clothing, to marry, to wage war, to navigate the seas and so on. For these our natural light is sufficient.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a> See Sermon, 11 August 1532, WA 36:493: 
</p><blockquote><p>
For human wisdom and reason cannot go any higher or further than to judge and draw conclusions as its eyes see and it feels, or than it grasps with its senses. But faith has to draw conclusions beyond and against such feeling and understanding, and cleave to what is presented to it by the Word.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a> See <em>Lectures on the Galatians</em>, 1531,  WA 40.1:607&ndash;8/LW 26:399 for the distinction between general and particular knowledge of God, and <em>Lectures on Jonah</em>, 1526,  WA 19:206&ndash;7/LW 19:53: 
</p><blockquote><p>
Such a light and such a perception [of God] is innate in the hearts of all men; and this light cannot be subdued or extinguished.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a> See <em>Lectures on Jonah</em>, 1526,  WA 19:206/LW 19:54: 
</p><blockquote><p>
[R]eason does admittedly believe that God is able and competent to help and to bestow; but reason does not know whether he is willing to do this also for us. That renders the position of reason unstable. Reason believes in God&rsquo;s might and is aware of it, but it is uncertain whether God is willing to employ this in our behalf, because in adversity it so often experiences the opposite to be true.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a> See <em>Disputation Concerning the Passage: &ldquo;The Word Was Made Flesh&rdquo;</em>, 1539,  WA 39.2:8/LW 38:244: 
</p><blockquote><p>
For as God has created distinct spheres in the heavens, so also he has created distinct kingdoms on earth, so that every matter and art may keep to its own place and kind and not be engaged outside its own centre, in which it has been placed.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a> See <em>Lectures on the Galatians</em>, 1531,  WA 40.1:369 note: 
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Follow not the judgement of reason, which tells you that [Christ] is angry with sinners; but kill reason and believe in him.  
</p></blockquote><p>
(This is not translated in LW, but is in the &ldquo;Middleton&rdquo; translation, 1531/1575 [1953: 227].)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a> See Christmas Postils, 1522, WA 10.1&ndash;1:506: 
</p><blockquote><p>
All this is immeasurably far above, and contrary to, reason&hellip; In this God is seeking only that man may have the humility to bring his reason into captivity and be subject to divine truth.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a> See  also WA 39.2:5/LW 38:242: 
</p><blockquote><p>
We would act more correctly if we left dialectic and philosophy in their own sphere and learned to speak in a new language in the realm of faith outside all such spheres.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a> See  WA 39.2:12: &ldquo;The syllogism is not allowed into the mysteries of faith and theology. Philosophy is error in theology&rdquo;; and <em>Disputation Against Scholastic Theology</em>, 1517,  WA 1:226/LW 31:12: &ldquo;No syllogistic form is valid when applied to divine terms&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a> See <em>Lectures on Galatians</em>, 1535, WA 40.I:412/LW 26:263: 
</p><blockquote><p>
When we theologians talk about &ldquo;doing&rdquo;, therefore, it is necessary that we speak about doing with faith, because in theology we have no right reason and good will except faith.
</p></blockquote><p>
 &ldquo;The Right and Wrong Use of Reason&rdquo;, 1533, WA TR 1, no. 439/LW 54:71: 
</p><blockquote><p>
[R]eason, when illuminated [by the Spirit], helps faith by reflecting on something, but reason without faith isn&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t be helpful. Without faith the tongue utters nothing but blasphemies&hellip; But reason that is illuminated takes all its thoughts from the Word.</p></blockquote>
</div>


<div id="note-19">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a> For a strikingly more ambitious reading of Luther&rsquo;s view of reason, which is historically interesting but interpretatively implausible, see Heinrich Heine 1835 [2007: 32]: 
</p><blockquote><p>
In saying that his teachings could be contradicted only by the Bible itself or by means of rational argument, Luther granted human reason the right to explain the Bible, and Reason was thus acknowledged as the highest judge in all religious controversies. Thus arose in Germany what is called freedom of the spirit or, by another name, freedom of thought. Thinking became a right, and the authority of reason became legitimate.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a> See  Richard H. Popkin, <em>The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Spinoza</em>,  who starts this classic study by referring to Luther on these issues (1979: 1&ndash;8). See  also Rex 2017a: 224&ndash;229. The difficulty of interpreting scripture is a running theme in Erasmus&rsquo;s response to Luther in <em>Hyperaspistes</em>, which emphasises that even Luther&rsquo;s followers disagree amongst themselves.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a> See <em>Praelectio in librum iudicium</em>, 1516ff, WA 4:554: 
</p><blockquote><p>
When I was a monk they used to despise the Bible. Nobody understood the Psalter. They used to believe that the Epistle to the Romans contained some controversies about matters of Paul&rsquo;s day and was of no use for our age. Scotus, Thomas, Aristotle were the ones to read;
</p></blockquote><p>
 <em>Lectures on Genesis</em>, 1535&ndash;1545, WA 43:94/LW 3:306: 
</p><blockquote><p>
After those who had devoted themselves to sacred studies had come upon commentaries of human beings, they not only spent most of their time reading the ancient theologians, but eventually also busied themselves with Aristotle, Averroes, and others, who later on gave rise to the Thomases, the Scotuses, and similar monstrosities;
</p></blockquote><p>
 and a Church Postil from 1522 WA 10.1&ndash;1:569/LW 52:166: 
</p><blockquote><p>
There is no greater reputation than that which is derived from the knowledge of Aristotle in the universities. Yet that reputation is false, for that knowledge is nothing; it is simply opposed to Christ and has arisen to destroy him. 
</p></blockquote><p>
For more on Luther&rsquo;s efforts at curricular reform (undertaken alongside Melanchthon), see Kusukawa 1995.</p>
</div>


<div id="note-22">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a> See Sermon, 27 April 1522,  WA 10.3:92; Church Postil  1522 WA 10.1&ndash;1:115; and <em>Against Latomus</em>,  1521, WA 8:127/LW 32:258: 
</p><blockquote><p>
Thomas wrote a great deal of heresy, and is responsible for the reign of Aristotle, the destroyer of godly doctrine. 
</p></blockquote><p>
On Aquinas&rsquo;s general commitment to Aristotle, see  &ldquo;An Opinion about Thomas Aquinas&rdquo;, 1532, WA TR 1 no. 283/LW 54:39: 
</p><blockquote><p>
This is the procedure of Thomas. First he takes statements [<em>sententias</em>] from Paul, Peter, John, Isaiah, etc. Afterwards he concludes that Aristotle says so and so and he interprets Scripture according to Aristotle.
</p></blockquote><p>
 For further discussion, see Gerrish 1962: 128&ndash;135, Grane 1969 and 1970, Pesch 1967, Janz 1983 and 1989, Marshall 1999. As is often noted, Luther&rsquo;s criticism of Aquinas on justification is relatively infrequent, and it is more often other Aristotelian aspects of his thought that are singled out: see, e.g., Janz 1983: 59&ndash;61.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a> Daphne Hampson puts this point clearly, while referring to the wider literature on this issue: 
</p><blockquote><p>
[<em>I</em>]<em>ustus</em> and <em>peccator</em> are relational terms and we are involved in a relational understanding of what it is to be justified. There is a sense in which neither term refers to the inward &ldquo;state&rdquo; of the person. Certainly neither is to be understood as a quality which could be predicated of the human, understood as a substantial entity. On the one hand God, for Christ&rsquo;s sake, holds the sinner to be just; he acquits us&hellip; Thus we may say that we are indeed to be considered fully just. On the other hand when the human is placed <em>coram deo</em> (before God), faced with God&rsquo;s goodness he must necessarily judge himself a sinner. But again it is not so much that the human is a sinner in himself. It is not that there is nothing good in the human. It is simply that when one considers the nature of God, the human cannot bring anything to God, on account of which God could accept him. In relation to God, he must count himself a sinner. The human thus has a double sense of himself, as both fully just and yet also as a sinner. (Hampson 2001: 25)</p></blockquote>

<div id="note-24">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a> See Luther&rsquo;s <em>Sermon on the Day of St. Peter and St. Paul</em> (1519): 
</p><blockquote><p>
For it is true that a man helped by grace is more than a man; indeed, the grace of God gives him the form of God and deifies him, so that
even the Scriptures call him &ldquo;God&rdquo; and &ldquo;God&rsquo;s son&rdquo;. (WA 2:247&ndash;48/LW 51:58) 
</p></blockquote><p>
See V.-M. K&auml;rkk&auml;inen 2006 and Bielfeldt 2016 for helpful discussions of the &ldquo;Finnish interpretation&rdquo; and its implications. The papers collected in Braaten and Jenson 1998 give a representative discussion of some of the issues.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a> The doctrine of transubstantiation claims that there is a change of substance from bread and wine to the body and blood of Christ while the accidents of bread and wine remain; the doctrine of real presence or consubstantiation makes no such claim about a change of substance and merely holds that the body and blood of Christ is substantially present when the Eucharist is celebrated.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a> WA TR 5 no. 6419. Luther generally refers to Ockham with approval, calling him &ldquo;my dear master&rdquo; (<em>Exhortation to All Clergy Assembled at Augsburg</em>, 1530, WA 30.2:300/LW 34:27); see also <em>Kleine Antwort auf Herzog Georgen n&auml;chstes Buch</em>, 1533, WA 38:160.</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a> See also the subsequent thesis: 
</p><blockquote><p>
Free will, after the Fall, has power to do good only in a passive capacity, but it can always do evil in an active capacity. (WA 1:354/LW 31:40)
</p></blockquote><p>
 As Alfsv&aring;g 2015: 52&ndash;3 notes, in the <em>Assertio</em> Luther went beyond the <em>Dissertation</em>, as 
</p><blockquote><p>
Here he not only declares &ldquo;free will&rdquo; to be a concept without factual reference, he even insists that there is no one in the position even to think on one&rsquo;s own, either good or bad, as everything happens with absolute necessity.
</p></blockquote><p>
 However, as Alfsv&aring;g also notes, when Luther translated
 the <em>Assertio</em> into German as <em>Grund und Ursach aller
 Artikel</em> [Defense and Explanation of All the Articles] in March
 1521, &ldquo;[Luther&rsquo;s] rejection of free will did not contain
 any reference to the idea of absolute necessity&rdquo; (see, 1521,  WA 7:446&ndash;51/LW 32:92&ndash;4).</p>

In <em>Hyperaspistes</em>, Erasmus associated the first two options
with Augustine and Karlstadt respectively, and sets them out as
follows: &ldquo;When Augustine posits co-operating grace, he confesses
that free will also does something in a good work; Karlstadt affirms
that it does nothing [in a good work] but remains passive; you
[Luther] teach that it does nothing in a good work or a bad one,
either before grace or after grace, but that it is a meaningless word,
pure and simple&rdquo; (Erasmus 1526 [1999: 284&ndash;5]).

<blockquote><p>
[S]in must be forgiven before good works can be done. For works do not drive out sin, but the driving out of sin leads to good works. For good works must be done with a joyful heart and good conscience towards God, that is, out of the forgiveness of guilt.

Thus Paul explains the law rightly when he lets no one remain without sin but proclaims the wrath of God to all who want to live virtuously [<em>wollen wol leben</em>] by nature or by free will. He makes them out to be no better than public sinners; he says they are hard of heart and unrepentant.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
Anyone who does not believe but goes on doubting the grace and love of God will not have the heart to express his love and thanks to God by responding to his neighbour in love. However, this faith which recognizes the great grace and goodness of God which helped him from death to life, always inflames a man&rsquo;s heart to love and to good, even to his enemies, just as God has done for him.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>
I will therefore give myself as Christ to my neighbour, just as Christ offered himself to me; I will do nothing in this life except what I see is necessary, profitable, and salutary to my neighbour, since through faith I have an abundance of all good things in Christ. </p></blockquote>

<p>
And <em>Sermons on the First Epistle of St. Peter</em>, 1523, WA 12:331/LW 30:77:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
Christians&hellip;are not obligated to do anything more than serve and help their neighbour with all they have, just as Christ helped them. All their works are performed without compulsion and for nothing; they flow from a happy and cheerful heart, which thanks, praises, and lauds God for all the good things it has received from him. Thus St. Paul writes in 1 Tim 1:9 that &ldquo;the law is not laid down for the just&rdquo;; for of their own accord they do without recompense and unbidden everything God wants. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
See also the <em>Second Disputation Against the Antinomians</em>,
1538, where Luther speaks of the law being &ldquo;empty&rdquo;
(<em>lex vacua</em>) when the law no longer presents itself in an
accusatory form &mdash; which is how it is experienced by &ldquo;the
angels and saints in heaven&rdquo; who &ldquo;do with joy the things
of the law&rdquo; (WA 39.1:433, translated in Sonntag (ed. and
trans.), <em>Only the Decalogue is Eternal</em>, 91&ndash;92).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-36">

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-36">36.</a> Luther took himself to be following Paul in making this view of law distinctive of Christianity, as against the &ldquo;legalism&rdquo; of Judaism (see for example <em>Against Latomus</em>, 1522, WA 8:70&ndash;3/LW 32:177&ndash;180), though it remains a matter of dispute whether this is a legitimate reading of the Jewish attitude to law, and of Paul&rsquo;s criticism of it, or whether it is instead Luther&rsquo;s projection of his own views: see the debate on Paul begun by E. P. Sanders (1977).</p>

</p><blockquote><p>
We say that the law is good and useful, but in its proper use, namely, first, as we said earlier, to restrain civic transgressions; and secondly to reveal spiritual transgressions.</p></blockquote>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-38">38.</a> See <em>Against the Heavenly Prophets</em>, 1525,  WA 18:80/LW 40:97: 
</p><blockquote><p>
Thus, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill, commit adultery, steal, etc.&rdquo; are not Mosaic laws only, but also the natural law written in each man&rsquo;s heart, as St. Paul teaches (Rom. 2 [:15])&hellip;Otherwise, were it not naturally written in the heart, one would have to teach and preach the law for a long time before it became the concern of conscience. The heart must also find and feel the law in itself. Otherwise it would not become a matter of conscience for anyone.

</p><blockquote><p>
Why does one then keep and teach the Ten Commandments? Answer: Because the natural laws were never so orderly and well written as by Moses. 
</p></blockquote><p>
However, even within the decalogue, there are some commandments which are &ldquo;ceremonial laws&rdquo; and so do not need to be followed in the way they are practiced by the Jews, or which require a different interpretation, such as keeping the sabbath and the prohibition of images, where in Luther&rsquo;s Large Catechism the latter is subordinated into the first commandment. </p>

<blockquote><p>
This is why Moses&rsquo;s law cannot be simply and completely valid among us. We have to take into consideration the character and ways of our land when we make or apply laws and rules. 
</p></blockquote><p>
See also <em>Against the Heavenly Prophets</em>, 1525,  WA 18:81/LW 40:98, where Luther compares aspects of the law of Moses to the Sachsenspeigel, which was a legal compendium of economic and social laws governing Madgenburg and Halberstadt, thereby arguing these parts of the Mosaic law do not apply beyond the Jews, and so have no authority over Gentiles. Luther makes this distinction in part to undercut the position of more radical reformers such as Karlstadt, whom he accused of wrongheadedly basing their opposition to images on these aspects of Mosaic law. </p>

Just as [the Christian] performs all other works of love which he himself does not need&mdash;he does not visit the sick in order that he himself may be made well, or feed others because he himself needs food&mdash;so he serves the governing authority not because he needs it but for the sake of others, that they may be protected and that the wicked may not become worse.</p></blockquote>

You do not want to endure evil or suffering, but rather want to be free and to experience only goodness and justice. However, Christ says that we should not resist evil or injustice but always yield, suffer, and let things be taken from us. If you will not bear this law, then lay aside the name of Christian and claim another name that accords with your actions&hellip; [T]he Christian law tells us not to strive against injustice, not to grasp the sword, not to protect ourselves, not to avenge ourselves, but to give up life and property, and let whoever takes it have it. We have all we need in our Lord, who will not leave us, as he has promised [Heb. 13:5]. Suffering! suffering! Cross! cross! This and nothing else is the Christian law!</p></blockquote>

<h1>Why Should Libraries at Small Colleges or Public Universities Support the SEP?</h1>

<p>
A question that we sometimes encounter is:</p>

<blockquote>
 Why should libraries at small colleges or public universities pay
membership dues to an organization (SEPIA) that supports a project at a large,
rich, private institution like Stanford?  </blockquote>

<p>
There are three reasons we give in response to this question:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#guarantee">SEPIA membership dues come with a money-back guarantee.</a></li>
<li><a href="#sense">Joining SEPIA makes economic sense.</a></li>
<li><a href="#project">SEPIA dues support a world-wide project, not just a Stanford project.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
 Of these, the most novel and perhaps most significant is the first
&mdash; the guarantee.</p>

<h2><a id="guarantee">SEPIA membership dues come with a money-back guarantee.</a></h2>

<p>
 The SEP's funding plan is a true partnership between Stanford
University and the world-wide library community.  Our library partners
(ICOLC and SPARC) helped us create a plan in which the academic
library community attempts to raise $3 million (of the $4.125 million
needed).  These funds are being put into an <em>escrow</em> account
("The SEP Library Fund") in Stanford's endowment.  The conditions
placed on this account are that (1) the payout from The SEP Library
Fund can only be used to support the SEP, and (2) should the SEP
project ever terminate, <strong>all the funds in The SEP Library Fund
would be returned to the contributing libraries, together with any
interest and appreciation that hasn't been spent</strong> on the
payout to the project.  Any interest and appreciation in excess of the
payout <em>stays</em> with The SEP Library Fund and in reasonable
economic times, the fund will grow.</p>

<p> Consequently, your membership dues become a protected investment
with the following features: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Library (department, foundation, etc.) money does
<em>not</em> disappear (as it would if paid to a publisher),
but is rather put to work to support open access,</li>
  <li>The membership dues do <em>not</em> constitute a gift to a rich
private institution, since Stanford can't make use of the money except
to administer the SEP for the benefit of all,</li>
  <li>Stanford must return the money (together with any unspent interest) 
should the project ever terminate, and </li> 
  <li>The membership dues yields a variety of other perks, such as the
right to download/store our archives, the branding we will stamp on
SEP entry pages sent to your institution, etc. (for a complete list,
see the
 <a href="librarians.html">Open Letter to Librarians</a>).</li>
  </ul>

<p>
 So this is truly a novel model for funding an open access reference
work.</p>

<h2><a id="sense">Joining SEPIA Makes Economic Sense</a></h2>

<p>
 We'd like to suggest that by supporting the SEP's plan at the
recommended level, your institution would be acting in its own
economic self-interest. Your library budget is under enormous
pressure. Librarians seek ways to reduce annual costly outlays and
they have an economic interest in supporting innovative alternative
publishing and funding models that avoid such outlays.  (Indeed, open
access journals and reference works are viewed as desirable, but no
one seems to know how to fund them.)  On our plan, libraries pay a
one-time cost (with the option to spread it over 3 years), as opposed
to the <em>ongoing</em> costs associated with a traditional
subscription model.  We have found a plan on which everyone
contributes a little bit to help preserve open access for all.  In
return, our library supporters receive the benefits of membership in
the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy International Association
(SEPIA).</p>

<p>
 Students and scholars at small, low/moderate-income, and public
institutions are using the SEP.  Given that the SEP is being funded by
a global community effort, all the institutions using the SEP should
therefore help ensure its long-term viability.  Note that computers
from a wide range of departments across your campus access the SEP.
(If you write to us, we can send you a total number of accesses to the
SEP from the computers on your campus.)  This justifies using library
funds from different units within the University, not just from the
Philosophy Department.</p>

<p>
  We opened our budget and budget justification to the large library
umbrella organizations who helped us create our funding plan.  They
vetted our budget and found it to be reasonable.  The fact that they
are recommending our project indicates that they believe the SEP
funding model to be in the interests of their constituent libraries.
Our library partners agreed that if we were to move to a subscription
model (which cuts off those who don't pay) or sold ourselves to one of
the publishers who wanted to buy us out, the library community would,
in the long run, have to pay more to obtain the SEP, and on an ongoing
basis.  (For a fuller discussion of our reasons for not adopting a
traditional subscription model, see the document
 <a href="problems.html">Problems with a Traditional Funding Model</a>.)</p>

<h2><a id="project">SEPIA dues support a world-wide project, not just a Stanford project</a></h2>

<p>
 It is important to note that the question we are addressing here
presupposes that the SEP is a &ldquo;Stanford project&rdquo;.  But
that is not completely accurate.  Our 1300+ authors and 115+ subject
editors who write and referee the content of the SEP are distributed
at universities throughout the world. By supporting the SEP, you are
not supporting Stanford but rather a world-wide (and open access)
scholarly publishing project that reaches far beyond the walls of a
single institution or country.  As we mentioned earlier, Stanford may
use the SEPIA membership dues it has collected from the library
community only for the support of the SEP, and thus for the benefit of
everyone, given that the SEP is freely available and open access.</p>

<p> The SEP differs from a proprietary series with a publisher's or
university's name on it; you cannot access the content of those
publications without paying for them.  Stanford's name is on the
project because its contribution to the project has been and continues
to be quite substantial.  Stanford has (a) provided support to the SEP
since its inception, including office space, networking, and
administrative support; (b) contributed startup costs during the
1995&ndash;1997 academic years; (c) waived indirect costs on SEP
grants or contributed cost-sharing funds to those grants; (d)
contributed annual funds to cover part of our operating costs as
bridge funding while we raise an endowment; and (e) agreed to use its
Office of Development to help us raise $1.125 million from private
donors.

<p>
 The SEP organizes the members of the professional community of
philosophers to collaboratively maintain a world-class, up-to-date
reference work.  Now we &mdash; with our library partners &mdash; are
trying to organize and encourage the members of the library community
to collaboratively keep this resource available in perpetuity.  </p>

<p>
 We hope you will choose to join us in this effort! </p>

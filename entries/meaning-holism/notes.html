<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Meaning Holism</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a> There have been other
ways of characterizing holism and atomism, most notably Fodor and
Lepore&rsquo;s characterization of holism in terms of the metaphysical
thesis that &ldquo;A property is holistic just in case if anything has
it, then lots of things do&rdquo; (Fodor &amp; Lepore 1992:
6). However, this typically isn&rsquo;t how meaning holism is defined, and
holists in the more typical sense presented above might admit that
there could be a language with just one word, yet still insist that
for whatever number of words a language had, the meanings of those
words would have to be interdependent (see Antony 1993: 141). In
particular, while they could admit that there could be languages with
a single word, they would still insist that <em>English</em> is not
one of them, and that the meanings of English terms were determined
holistically (see Khalidi 1993).  Or, conversely, it might be that
meanings were constitutively independent, but if there was one, there
would have to be many for some other (perhaps physiological) reason
(see Antony 1993, Pagin 2006, Dresner 2012). In what follows, then, I
will be assuming that holism is characterized in terms of some version
of the interdependence view.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>  So while Harman
(1973) typically characterizes meaning in terms of inferential role,
he is happy to claim that &ldquo;What our words mean depends
on <em>everything</em> we believe, on <em>all</em> the assumptions we
are making&rdquo; (Harman 1973: 14).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>  See Pagin 2006 for a
more systematic attempt to characterize various ways of understanding
the &ldquo;interdependence&rdquo; talk associated with holism.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>  Generalizing, perhaps
incorrectly, from Wittgenstein&rsquo;s claim that &ldquo;For
a <em>large</em> class of cases&mdash;though not for all&mdash;in
which we employ the word &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; it can be defined thus:
the meaning of a word is its use in the language&rdquo; (Wittgenstein
1953: 43).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>  That is, the
&ldquo;kind of mental content that does not depend on an individual&rsquo;s
environment&rdquo; (Brown 2011). Both arguments deriving holism from
the needs of a preferred form of psychological explanation would
presuppose that you can get holism about <em>meaning</em> by
establishing holism about <em>mental content</em>, and many arguments
for meaning holism rely on such a transition.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>  This formulation is
taken from Devitt 1993: 281, who claims &ldquo;at its most extreme,
semantic, or meaning, holism is the doctrine that all of the
inferential properties of an expression constitute its meaning&rdquo;
(Devitt 1993: 281).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>  For a discussion of
the analytic/synthetic distinction and Quine&rsquo;s criticism of it, see
Rey 2008.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>  For a discussion of
this problem see Lewis 1983, 1984; the rather robust type of
metaphysical realism that he suggests as a solution to this problem,
is, for many philosophers, a cost in itself.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>  The move from Devitt
1980 to Devitt 1996 is a good illustration of this.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>  For a discussion
for how such cases cause problems for asymmetric dependence theories,
see Margolis &amp; Laurence 1999: 68.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>  Of course, the
atomist and molecularist could argue that the meaning holist faces a
number of serious problems as well, and their reasons for thinking
this will be the subject of
the <a href="index-2.html#ProForMeaHol">section 3</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>  Of course this
view itself could be described as a type of &ldquo;metasemantic&rdquo;
holism that is not without its interest, and some philosophers
commonly associated with holism (such as Davidson 1984) might best be
understood as metasemantic holists rather than meaning holists.  While
meaning holism suggests that any difference in my beliefs would
produce a corresponding difference in what I mean, this merely
metasemantic holism has no such commitment to instability. If, for
instance, one endorsed a (roughly Davidsonian) holistic metasemantic
view according to which what I meant by all my terms was equated to
the set of assignments that maximizes the truth of all my beliefs,
then what I meant by, say, &ldquo;mug&rdquo; would probably be the set
of objects that made most of my &ldquo;mug&rdquo;-beliefs true, and
there is little reason to think that the members of that set of
objects would change if I were to replace my belief that &ldquo;my
favorite coffee mug is in the kitchen&rdquo; with the belief &ldquo;my
favorite coffee mug is in the study&rdquo;. What I meant would be a
function of all my beliefs, but that function would not be not
one-to-one. (For more on this, see Warfield 1993; Pagin 1997, 2006;
Jackman 1999a, 2003a, 2006). Because of this, the worries about
communication, language learning, disagreement, inference and change
of mind that plague the meaning holist
(see <a href="index-2.html#Ins">section 3.2</a>) seem considerably less
pressing (indeed, not pressing at all) for the merely metasemantic
holist that denies that the function from use to meaning is
one-to-one.  A related move can be found with Dresner&rsquo;s
measurement-theoretic approach to semantics, which allows such
many-one relations without pushing the holism entirely to the
metasemantic level (see Dresner 2002, 2006).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>  As he puts it:</p>

<blockquote><p> The semantic values of all the logically compound
sentences are computable entirely from the semantic values of <em>less
complex</em> sentences. It is just that one may need to look at the
values of <em>many</em>&mdash;in the limit <em>all</em>&mdash;the less
complex sentences, not just the ones that appear as sub-formulae of
the compound whose semantic value is being computed. The semantics
is <em>projectible</em> and <em>systematic</em>, in that semantic
values are determined for all syntactically admissible compounds, or
arbitrary degrees of complexity. It is <em>learnable</em>&mdash;at
least in principle, putting issues of contingent psychology aside, in
the ideal sense that we have been working with. (Brandom 2008:
135)</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-14">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>  Though for some
doubts about how much further this sort of truth-conditional semantics
can go, see Pietroski 2003, 2005.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>  This connection
between meaning holism and instability is not only assumed by critics
of holism, such as Fodor and Lepore 1992 and Devitt 1996, but is also
taken for granted in sympathetic &ldquo;expository&rdquo; accounts of
what holism is such as Block 1998 and Guttenplan 1994. Indeed Block
(1995: 152), and to a certain extent Horwich (2005: 38), are willing
to <em>define</em> meaning holism in terms of this purported
consequence. (See also Becker 1998; Lormand 1996 and Margolis &amp;
Laurence 1998 for more accounts foregrounding the importance of
instability, and Pagin 2006 for one of the few general expositions of
the view that doesn&rsquo;t make this assumption.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>  Given the
assumption that no one means the same thing by <em>all</em> of their
words, the conclusion that meaning is <em>idiosyncratic</em> follows
directly from meaning holism. The suggestion that meaning must also
be <em>unstable</em> follows not from meaning holism alone, but rather
from combination of meaning holism and the assumptions that meaning is
a function of our use. For instance, the worry that meaning holism
entails that no one means the same thing by their words today as they
did yesterday (because everyone makes at least <em>some</em> change to
their belief each day) presupposes not just meaning holism, but also
such a tight (perhaps even one-to-one) connection between meaning use (here
understood in terms of belief). (Thanks to David Chalmers stressing
this.). That said, while meaning holism doesn&rsquo;t entail that meaning be
tied to use in this way, the arguments <em>for</em> meaning holism
typically presuppose such a connection, so the objections to meaning
holism that assume that the meaning holist understands meaning in
terms of use still have considerable bite.  The meaning holist can&rsquo;t
simply give up the meaning/use connection without undercutting the
motivation for their own view. (Though we will see that some responses
to the objections to meaning holism work by at least loosening the
connection between meaning and <em>individual</em> use.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>  Though see
MacFarlane 2007 for a discussion of this &ldquo;natural&rdquo; sense
of disagreement, and a suggestion for a more nuanced explication of
disagreement that the meaning holist might avail themselves of (though
MacFarlane has explaining disagreement for the Relativist not the
holist in mind).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>  This would be less
serious if one had a notion of belief in which one already, in some
sense, believed all of the inferential commitments of one&rsquo;s explicit
beliefs (Brandom 1994), though it would still have the consequence of
an invalid inference changing the meanings of the terms involved
because of the new commitments acquired.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>  This objection
downplays, of course, the importance of psychological generalizations
such as &ldquo;If someone wants \(X\) more than \(Y\), and
is given a choice between \(X\) and \(Y\), they will
choose \(X\)&rdquo;, which could still be confirmed even if
everyone meant something different by what went in the
&ldquo;\(X\)&rdquo; and the &ldquo;\(Y\)&rdquo; slots.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>  Of course it would
also entail that the narrow meanings of &ldquo;water&rdquo; for
oneself and one&rsquo;s Twin-Earth counterpart would not be similar at all
(since we would endorse none of the same &ldquo;wide&rdquo; water
inferences). This makes the &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; content still
externalist in some sense (which might be a good or bad thing
depending on one&rsquo;s perspective&mdash;for instance, this lack of
similarity could explain why my twin and I purportedly
don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> succeed in communicating about
&ldquo;water&rdquo;), and thus suggests that the notion of
&ldquo;similarity&rdquo; we end up with is quite different from the
intuitive one (in which we and our Twin-Earth counterparts have mental
states with similar contents). If one typed beliefs by their
&ldquo;partial character&rdquo; (White 1982), one could avoid this
problem and argue that contents were similar if they were tied to many
beliefs with the same partial character.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>  Margolis &amp;
Laurence 1999: 64, though see Block 1993: 68, for a very different
take on the independence of narrow and wide content.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>  Bilgrami&rsquo;s defense
of the &ldquo;locality of content&rdquo; should not be confused with
Devitt&rsquo;s &ldquo;localism&rdquo; which is a type of context-invariant
meaning molecularism that Bilgrami would reject. (For a discussion of
this, see Talmage 1998.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>  One possibility is
that Bilgrami&rsquo;s view, rather than being a type of contextualism about
content is actually a type of relativism, and that the same belief
could be ascribed different contents (though always a subset of the
speaker&rsquo;s aggregate content) depending on the varying interests of
different ascribers and interlocutors (should the speaker be speaking
to a group, or have his utterance reported to a different
audience). (Though see note 30 for some reasons for thinking that
Bilgrami himself couldn&rsquo;t go this way, even if other contextualists
could.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>  See Burge 1979,
and the discussion in Lau &amp; Deutsch 2012.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>  This particular
problem would be eliminated if the anti-individualist tied meaning to
the inferences or beliefs that a society <em>ultimately</em> endorsed
rather than merely the ones that they <em>currently</em> do (see
Jackman 1999b). However, this sort of anti-individualism is
comparatively rare, and for present purposes, would leave us with a
position that is very much like the &ldquo;normative&rdquo; response
to instability that we will discuss in more detail below.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>  Though, of course,
Brandom would not indentify them himself in quite this way.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>  It is, then, not
surprising, that defenders of Normative accounts often focus
on <em>counterfactual supporting</em> inferences as being meaning
determining (Brandom 2007, 2009: 55, 172; Salis 2016, Sellars 1948),
and thus avoid the worry above (but see Fodor and Lepore 2007). Of
course, moving from merely truth preserving to counterfactual
supporting inferences might seem to push one towards molecularism, but
even a comparatively limited set of inferences could still exhibit the
spreading effect mentioned in
<a href="index-2.html#DirArg">section 2.1</a>.  (That is, even if only
a subset of inferences were relevant to the meaning of each term,
these subsets could still be extensive enough for the meanings of each
term to be interrelated.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-28">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>  Or if the meaning
holist understood things in terms of inferences, we could talk about
the validity of the corresponding inferences being guaranteed by the
meanings of the terms involved.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-29">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>  As suggested
earlier, one could be a meaning holist and still claim that many of
our beliefs aren&rsquo;t meaning-constitutive, provided that the set of
beliefs one did let in were interconnected enough for every term in
the language to be ultimately entangled with every other. However,
most meaning holists take the more extreme position of letting every
belief count.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">
<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>  Unless, of course,
one took the person evaluating me and my interlocutor as creating a
new context, and relative to <em>that</em> context our claims are
false. This would, of course, entail a much more widespread relativism
than the sort MacFarlane (2014) defends.  Incidentally, this
relativist, rather than contextualist, reading of the locality
principle would sit badly with Bilgrami&rsquo;s claim that, unlike aggregate
contents, Local contents have a type of &ldquo;psychological
reality&rdquo; (Bilgrami 1992: 12), and Bilgrami&rsquo;s stated lack of
sympathy with relativism (see Bilgrami 2011), so it is unlikely that
Bilgrami himself would want to take the position in this
direction.</p>

 More recently, however, this clich&eacute; has been turned on its head by
Sarah Bakewell, the title of whose surprise best-seller, <em>At the
Existentialist Caf&eacute;: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails</em>,
makes reference to the story of how Sartre and Beauvoir were
introduced to phenomenology by Raymond Aron in 1932: Aron pointed to
an apricot <em>ap&eacute;ritif</em> and said, &ldquo;if you are a
phenomenologist you can talk about this cocktail and make philosophy
out of it.&rdquo; Beyond the clich&eacute;s, there remains a real thirst for
the kind of experience-near philosophy that the existentialists found
in phenomenology.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 For instance, both Schacht (2012) and Malpas (2012) try to sketch a
coherent taxonomy for using terms like &ldquo;existential,&rdquo;
&ldquo;existentialism,&rdquo; and &ldquo;existentialist&rdquo; in a
systematic way that does justice to their historical provenance.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Some (e.g., MacIntyre 1967: 153) have found this interest in
producing a systematic account of existence incompatible with the
basic tenor of existentialism, which is supposed to be anti-rational,
anti-intellectual, a matter of passion, feeling, and literary
rhetoric. But while Kierkegaard and Nietzsche did attack the
complacent academic philosophy of their time, the latter, at least,
offered positive views of his own. And while later existentialists did
call into question the exclusive right of logical argumentation in
philosophical method, championing phenomenological description as
equally necessary, it is far too simplistic to identify the essence of
existentialism with these elements of protest and to reduce its
characteristic theses to the short-sightedness of &ldquo;a
disappointed rationalism&rdquo; (MacIntyre 1967: 152).</p>

 Husserl developed the phenomenological method by means of an eidetic
reduction&mdash;in which the philosopher was to reflect not on some
particular intentional experience (such as perception) but the
&ldquo;essence&rdquo; or universal structure exhibited by it&mdash;and
by means of an <em>epoch&eacute;</em>, or bracketing of the reality of
the world in order to study its pure (and, Husserl claimed, immanent)
givenness as a correlate of consciousness. To various degrees, the
existentialists rejected these aspects of Husserl&rsquo;s method and
the doctrine of the transcendental ego associated with them (see
Cooper 1999: 46&ndash;54; Zaner and Ihde 1973: 11&ndash;26), holding
that they undermined the true significance of the discovery of
intentionality. As Merleau-Ponty (1945 [1962, xiv]) famously wrote:
&ldquo;The most important lesson which the reduction teaches us is the
impossibility of a complete reduction.&rdquo; The relation between
transcendental and existential phenomenology is, however, quite
complex and remains in dispute. See, for a variety of views, Cooper
(1999), Spiegelberg (1984: 436&ndash;40), Dreyfus and Haugeland (1978:
222&ndash;38), Crowell (2001), Natanson (1968).</p>

 In fact, many of Kierkegaard&rsquo;s works were not written under his
own name but as authored by a series of <em>personae</em>, or
pseudonyms, which makes the attribution of particular views in his
texts to &ldquo;Kierkegaard&rdquo; problematic. Indeed, this strategy
of &ldquo;indirect communication&rdquo; was tied to the existential
themes that Kierkegaard sought to highlight in his dialectical
writings, but we shall ignore these complications here. For a good
discussion of Kierkegaard&rsquo;s pseudonymous authorship, see Hannay
(1982) and Hannay (2012).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a> Sartre&rsquo;s slogan derives from a
sentence in Heidegger&rsquo;s <em>Being and Time</em>: &ldquo;Das
&lsquo;Wesen&rsquo; des Daseins liegt in seiner Existenz,&rdquo; which
Macquarrie and Robinson translate, &ldquo;The &lsquo;essence&rsquo; of
Dasein lies in its existence&rdquo; (Heidegger 1927 [1962, 67]). In 1946
Heidegger maintained that Sartre had totally misunderstood the meaning
of the claim (Heidegger 1949 [1998, 250]), but certainly <em>some</em> of
what Sartre develops from it can be found in Heidegger too. For the
latter, the question of existence is not first of all a philosophical
one but rather the question raised by any human being: &ldquo;Who am
I?&rdquo; The fact that we raise such a question is not, for
Heidegger, an accidental feature of our psychology but an essential
feature of our being: I am such that &ldquo;in [my] very being that
being is an <em>issue</em> for [me]&rdquo; (Heidegger 1927 [1962, 32]. A
<em>philosophical</em> inquiry into existence, then, is a kind of
meta-inquiry into &ldquo;that which one inquires into when one asks
the question &lsquo;Who?&rsquo;&rdquo; (Heidegger 1927 [1962, 79]). This, in
turn, leads him to distinguish sharply between
&ldquo;categories&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>existentialia</em>&rdquo;,
i.e., between the philosophical concepts used to characterize entities
that answer to a &ldquo;what&rdquo; question and those that answer to
a &ldquo;who&rdquo; question: &ldquo;<em>Existentialia</em> and
categories are the two basic possibilities for characters of being.
The entities which correspond to them require different kinds of
primary interrogation respectively: any entity is either a
&lsquo;who&rsquo; (existence) or a &lsquo;what&rsquo; &hellip;&rdquo;
(Heidegger 1927 [1962, 71]).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 Heidegger himself is quite clear on the point that at a certain
formal level he is presenting a theory of the &ldquo;essential
structures&rdquo; that pertain to existence (Dasein): By means of
phenomenological inquiry &ldquo;there are certain structures which we
shall exhibit&mdash;not just any accidental structures, but essential
ones which, in every kind of being that factical Dasein may possess,
persist as determinative for the character of its being&rdquo;
(Heidegger 1927 [1962, 38]). Such an aim&mdash;which could also be found in
every existential philosopher who draws upon the resources of
phenomenology&mdash;belongs to the very character of philosophy as a
reflective and general inquiry. But the search for &ldquo;essential
structures&rdquo; in this sense does not undermine the distinction
between the &ldquo;what&rdquo; and the &ldquo;who,&rdquo; and thus the
<em>character</em> of these essential structures will have to be
understood differently in each case. As Heidegger puts it:
&ldquo;Accordingly, those characteristics which can be exhibited in
this entity are not &lsquo;properties&rsquo; present-at-hand of some
entity which &lsquo;looks&rsquo; so and so and is itself
present-at-hand; they are in each case possible ways for it to be, and
no more than that&rdquo; (Heidegger 1927 [1962, 67]).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 The fact that the category&mdash;natural, social, etc.&mdash;to which
these features belong can be disputed is irrelevant; indeed, even what
these features are is not decisive, since &ldquo;facticity&rdquo; as
such is simply whatever aspect of my being lies beyond the scope of my
freedom: the given. It is for the empirical sciences, not existential
philosophy, to say what these features are, and such empirical work
will always remain a matter of dispute. For instance, are
&ldquo;race&rdquo; and &ldquo;sex&rdquo; really concepts that capture
some given aspect of myself? This does not mean, however, that
existential philosophers have not tried to offer more robust theories
of facticity&mdash;for instance, Sartre&rsquo;s appropriation of
Marx&rsquo;s emphasis on economic categories, or Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s
attempt to develop an ontology of &ldquo;flesh.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Heidegger (1927 [1962, 85]) diagnoses the reason for our tendency to think
this way in his notion of &ldquo;falling&rdquo;: our practical
absorption in the world leads to a kind of self-forgetfulness in which
we think of ourselves in terms of what we have most to do with,
namely, in terms of things. &ldquo;Dasein&hellip;gets its ontological
understanding of itself in the first instance from those entities
which it itself is <em>not</em> but which it encounters
&lsquo;within&rsquo; its world, and from the being which they
possess.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 It should be noted that some existentialists, such as Jaspers, use
the term &ldquo;transcendence&rdquo; in a different sense, to refer to
the &ldquo;Encompassing,&rdquo; the whole that lies beyond the
ordinary, the mundane, and the reach of empirical science. For Jaspers
(1935 [1968, 60&ndash;61]), this leads to a strongly normative use of the
term <em>Existenz</em> as &ldquo;the Encompassing, not in the sense of
the vastness of a horizon of all horizons, but rather in the sense of
a fundamental origin, the condition of selfhood without which all the
vastness of being becomes a desert.&rdquo; As Jaspers uses the term,
<em>Existenz</em> corresponds most closely to what existential
philosophers typically call <em>authentic</em> existence, while what
they refer to as &ldquo;inauthentic existence&rdquo; does not count as
<em>Existenz</em> at all for Jaspers. On authentic existence, see
below.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 This irreducible duality in the self makes possible what Sartre
(1943 [1992, 86]&ndash;116) calls &ldquo;bad faith,&rdquo; a kind of project
of self-deception. In order to produce excuses bad faith first takes a
third-person stance toward itself, identifying itself entirely with
facticity. When it becomes necessary to elude what it has made of
itself, however, it then adopts the first-person agent&rsquo;s
perspective, identifying itself entirely with transcendence, where all
is &ldquo;possibility.&rdquo; In neither case can the deception fully
succeed&mdash;it is a &ldquo;metastable&rdquo; structure that will
inevitably collapse into anguish. But as Sartre points out, without
these two facets of existence&mdash;i.e., if consciousness were the
simple &ldquo;I think&rdquo; that the modern tradition took it to
be&mdash;it would be impossible to explain how the very
<em>project</em> of self-deception could be entertained.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Sartre (1943 [1992, 90&ndash;94]) argues that the Freudian theory of the
unconscious is based on an incoherent view of consciousness, but he
embraces the project of psychoanalysis as an uncovering of the
&ldquo;fundamental project&rdquo; of an individual&rsquo;s life. For a
brief example of how this works, see his <em>Baudelaire</em>. In
general, it is at this point that existentialism makes contact with
the tradition of hermeneutics and the <em>Verstehen</em> tradition in
the human sciences. This becomes especially explicit in Sartre&rsquo;s
later elaboration of his &ldquo;progressive-regressive method&rdquo;
in <em>Search for a Method</em>. (See especially Sartre 1960 [1968,
132&ndash;162]). See also Ludwig Binswanger&rsquo;s concept of
&ldquo;Dasein-analysis&rdquo; as a method in psychoanalysis and,
finally, the hermeneutic reading of Freud offered by Paul Ricoeur in
his <em>Freud and Philosophy</em>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 In <em>Fear and Trembling</em> Kierkegaard made a similar point when
he argued that Abraham had to remain &ldquo;silent&rdquo; about his
act&mdash;not in order to spare Sarah&rsquo;s or Isaac&rsquo;s
feelings (indeed, ethically, according to Kierkegaard, he was required
to speak), but because he could not say anything intelligible. His
&ldquo;act&rdquo; was singular, not part of a practice that could ever
be made public, and hence could not, strictly speaking, be understood,
even as a &ldquo;deviation&rdquo; from normal ethical behavior.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 On the other hand, to the extent that character is seen as an
unreflective source of my behavior, it will always be in tension with
the idea of authenticity. Can one, for instance, be inauthentically
courageous? Can I engage in &ldquo;courageous&rdquo; acts in the right
circumstances, for the right reasons, and so on, and still do them
&ldquo;as one does&rdquo;&mdash;that is, without drawing these
behaviors back to my first-person choice of myself in the world, a
commitment to being a courageous person? Important new systematic
treatments of the relation between authenticity and virtue ethics are
found in Jonathan Webber (2018) and Irene McMullin (2019). Webber
argues that Sartre&rsquo;s early position led him to claim, on
eudaimonistic grounds, that authenticity <em>itself</em> is a virtue;
later, however, having scrapped his own conception of freedom in favor
of Beauvoir&rsquo;s modification of it, he came to accept her
&ldquo;argument for a categorial moral imperative of
authenticity&rdquo; (2018: 19, 169&ndash;187). McMullin proposes the
eudaimonistic idea of &ldquo;existential flourishing,&rdquo; grounded
in authenticity, as the way toward &ldquo;a phenomenologically
sensitive form of virtue ethics&rdquo; (2019: 1). Here authenticity,
or resoluteness, &ldquo;requires ontological self-awareness: &hellip; the
ability to see and take responsibility for the kind of being that one
is&rdquo; (2019: 212)&mdash;namely, a kind of being for whom there
are different classes of reasons, paired with normative demands
arising from the three irreducible perspectives we can take on
ourselves (first-, second-, and third-personal), and for whom
&ldquo;there is no ultimate perspective from which the different
classes of reason can be definitively ordered&rdquo; (2019: 8).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 Sartre (1943 [1992]) adds a characteristic twist to this idea: the dual
structure of human existence (facticity/transcendence) brings with it,
formally, a kind of meta-project of doing justice simultaneously to
both sides so that their opposing claims&mdash;being such as to have a
fixed and stable identity while also being such as to be
free&mdash;are united authentically in one being. Such a being, says
Sartre, is what we imagine God to be. But what authenticity
(self-transparency) reveals is the impossibility of such a project
ever succeeding. Hence at a basic level all human projects contain an
element of futility&mdash;man is a &ldquo;useless passion,&rdquo; a
&ldquo;failed God,&rdquo; a &ldquo;worm&rdquo; in the heart of being.
For Sartre, this amounts to the claim that the idea of God is
self-contradictory.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 As already noted, recent writers in the existential tradition such as
Webber (2018) and McMullin (2019) have taken up the challenge of
normative ethics by construing authenticity in such a way that what
Sartre calls the &ldquo;ideality&rdquo; of values (see below) does not
preclude a substantive &ldquo;theory&rdquo; of value altogether.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Of course, not all philosophers who recognize the distinctive norm of
authenticity hold moral values to be groundless. A religious
existentialist such as Marcel explicitly denies Sartre&rsquo;s claim
that we choose our values; rather &ldquo;causes have their intrinsic
value and, consequently, values are real&hellip;I recognize them and
then posit my actions in accordance or in contradiction with these
values&rdquo; (Marcel 1946 [1968, 87]). But Marcel&rsquo;s position is not
typical, even for religious existentialists. Another frequently
disputed question is whether, given that moral values have no ultimate
foundation, a definite morality can nevertheless be derived from the
norm of authenticity itself. See Cooper (1999: 178&ndash;84) for an
attempt to show that the Sartrean ideal of &ldquo;commitment&rdquo;
and Marcel&rsquo;s&mdash;apparently contrary&mdash;ideal of
&ldquo;openness&rdquo; are in fact complementary aspects of
authenticity.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 As we saw (note 3 above) Alasdair MacIntyre argues that
existentialism is just disappointed rationalism and that its
hyperbolic rhetoric stems from its failure to abandon various
foundationalist assumptions. It is true that existentialism is a form
of anti-foundationalism, and the widespread rejection of
foundationalist assumptions in contemporary philosophy does remove
some of the shock value of existentialist theses. However, it does not
do away with the shock value of anxiety itself, and the carefree
anti-foundationalist &ldquo;ironist&rdquo; must admit, so long as
anxiety remains a possibility, that there is a deeper meaning to
foundationalism&mdash;or a greater sting in its loss&mdash;than irony

 The technicalities of Sartre&rsquo;s arguments for these points,
which ultimately turn on the question of how intentionality can be
explained ontologically, cannot concern us here, but see Sartre (1943 [1992,
3&ndash;30]), Crowell (2012c: 199&ndash;226) and the entry on Sartre in
this Encyclopedia.</p>

 Recent work on the relationship between Sartre and Beauvoir has
yielded a debate over the motives (and truth) of Beauvoir&rsquo;s
claim that she simply adopted Sartre&rsquo;s system as her own. In
sifting through this debate, Webber (2018: 67&ndash;75) argues that
Beauvoir&rsquo;s concept of freedom differs from the one Sartre
employs in his gambler example precisely by introducing the
phenomenological concept of &ldquo;sedimentation&rdquo; (derived from
Husserl through Merleau-Ponty). The idea here is that, while one is
&ldquo;ontologically&rdquo; free in Sartre&rsquo;s sense, one&rsquo;s
choices do not simply disappear when other choices are made; rather,
it becomes more difficult to change course the more a certain course
has been pursued. If, for Sartre, there can be no motives <em>in</em>
consciousness, for Beauvoir &ldquo;the sedimentation of socially
determined meanings&rdquo; can be &ldquo;internalized into
projects,&rdquo; and so she can &ldquo;ascribe to the
individual&rsquo;s social context a more substantial role in shaping
their behaviour than is available on either Freud&rsquo;s theory or
Sartre&rsquo;s initial form of existentialism&rdquo; (Webber 2018:
79). For Webber, this is the key to the genuinely
&ldquo;existentialist&rdquo; concept of freedom, and it informs
Sartre&rsquo;s discussions of freedom after <em>Being and
Nothingness</em>, where he is at pains to address
Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s criticism of that work as insufficiently
sensitive to the &ldquo;weight&rdquo; of history.</p>

 Heidegger&rsquo;s understanding of the relation between values and
freedom has many similarities with Sartre&rsquo;s view, though the
differences are not without importance. For a good treatment of these
two thinkers see Fell (1979).</p>

 For these reasons, existentialist ethics is often called an ethics of
the &ldquo;situation.&rdquo; As Mary Warnock (1967: 37) writes,
Sartre&rsquo;s existentialism suggests that &ldquo;instead of coming
to situations armed with lists or sets of principles, some one of
which has got to be put into practice, we must think of each situation
afresh, and try to see what, stock descriptions, duties and principles
apart, ought to be done for the best. If we are faced with a situation
in which we have to make a moral decision, on this view, we must
really decide <em>for ourselves</em> what to do, remembering that we
<em>could</em> decide anything, and not seeking to evade
responsibility by sheltering under the rules, the principles, of what
one <em>must</em> do in such a case.&rdquo; In this connection,
existentialism anticipates current interest in the problem of
<em>judgment</em>. In her version of existential virtue ethics, Irene
McMullin describes the situation as one of irreducible
&ldquo;normative complexity&rdquo; and shows how practical
life&mdash;both in the relatively rare instances of explicit
deliberation and in ongoing, non-deliberative engagement in our
projects&mdash;involves a continual &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; of the
conflicts that arise from this complexity. Reasons for acting do not
&ldquo;fit neatly in a simple hierarchy or single normative
scale&rdquo; (2019: 38), and so (we might say) require what Kant
called &ldquo;reflective judgment&rdquo;&mdash;which starts from some
particular and <em>seeks</em> the &ldquo;universal&rdquo; that
pertains to it&mdash;rather than &ldquo;determinative judgment,&rdquo;
which presumes to possess the universal and simply subsumes the
particular under it. The existential point here is that, even in
reflective judgment, the reason (&ldquo;universal&rdquo;) upon which
my negotiation in situation alights remains <em>at issue</em> in my
choice, and the &ldquo;hierarchy&rdquo; that emerges from choosing to
go on in a certain way is ultimately sustained by nothing but my
freedom.</p>

 It is a complicated matter to say what the limits of such a
&ldquo;tradition&rdquo; are. See Guignon (1993) and Crowell (2004) for
contrasting views.</p>

 The literature on this is immense, but for a concise (and in my view)
even-handed treatment, see Hatab (2018).</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a> A typical example, which also
illustrates the intimate intertwining of Sartre&rsquo;s and Beauvoir&rsquo;s
existential thought, is found in Beauvoir&rsquo;s 1955 take-down of
Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s criticism of Sartre&rsquo;s philosophy and politics after
the former&rsquo;s retreat from communism following the Korean war. Accusing Merleau-Ponty of disingenuously attacking a straw
man&mdash;&ldquo;pseudo-Sartreanism&rdquo;&mdash;by reading Sartre in
bad faith, she proceeds to argue that Sartre&rsquo;s continuing engagement
on the side of the proletariat follows directly from his views on
facticity and the &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; character of all action. In
this case, it is the exigency of the &ldquo;need&rdquo; and
&ldquo;misery&rdquo; of the proletariat, and not some arbitrary choice
or totalizing theory of &ldquo;revolution,&rdquo; that makes a claim
on Sartre: &ldquo;nothing comes from freedom&rdquo; all by itself
&ldquo;but from the situation&rdquo; (Beauvoir 1955 [1989b, 22]). In embracing
parliamentary democracy, in contrast, Merleau-Ponty &ldquo;fell victim
to the old idealism&rdquo; (Beauvoir 1955 [1989b, 38]). This essay also
provides an excellent account of how Beauvoir understood the
compatibility between Sartre&rsquo;s ontology in <em>Being and
Nothingness</em> and his Marxism.</p>

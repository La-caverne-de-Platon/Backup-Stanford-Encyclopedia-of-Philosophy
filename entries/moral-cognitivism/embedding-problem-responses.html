<h2>Embedding Problem Response Strategies</h2>

<p>Much if not all of the recent innovations in non-cognitivist
theorizing stem from attempts to answer the Frege-Geach objection. It
might thus be helpful to go into somewhat greater depth about the
embedding problem and responses to it. This supplement does that by
going into more detail than the main text about various
non-cognitivist strategies for addressing that objection.  It roughly
corresponds to the last several sections of section 4.1 of the main
entry but goes into more detail than the main text.</p>

<h3>A logic of attitudes</h3>


<p> It is a condition of adequacy for the project of extending moral
semantics to embedded normative claims that the embedded sentences and
the judgements stand in the intuitively correct logical relations to
one another.  One standard cognitivist way of explaining the logical
relations between attitudes is to offer an account of the contents of
the states that are also good candidates for being the contents of the
sentences that express those attitudes, for example by postulating
propositions as the semantic values of sentences and the contents of
beliefs. Beliefs and sentences can then each inherit their logical
relations from the logical relations among the contents they
express. And the norms of belief revision then include constraints
which reflect responses to those logical relations. For example, one
such proposal would postulate norms of belief revision that require us
to try (other things equal) to eschew inconsistency in the contents of
our thoughts. That norm would be responsive to the independent fact
that such contents stand in the logical relation of contradiction to
one another.</p>

<p>
An influential contrasting non-cognitivist approach to explaining the
logic of normative sentences and attitudes starts from the other end,
postulating norms governing combinations of attitude that do not
(much) depend on prior relations of implication or consistency among
their contents. From there the strategy goes on to generate relations
of implication and consistency between the sentences that express
these attitudes as reflections of the norms which in the first
instance govern attitudes directly. If there are norms governing the
co-acceptance of attitudes such that certain combinations are ruled
out perhaps those norms can also underwrite the relation of logical
inconsistency that we intuitively find among the sentences expressing
those judgments. And from there perhaps we can explain logical
implication by deploying the fact that the premises of valid arguments
are inconsistent with the negation of the conclusions of those
arguments.  If the general idea is promising, non-cognitivists should
aim to provide a systematic story linking simple and complex sentences
to attitudes of the right sort to capture intuitive logical relations
among those sentences.</p>

<p>
Several such accounts begin with conditionals with evaluative
antecedents. The focus on these no doubt stems from concern with the
examples that Geach used to motivate his worry.  One popular approach
has been to suggest that conditional judgements are higher order
attitudes aimed at the judgements that would be expressed by the
sentences which they embed. These higher order attitudes might either
be complex beliefs (Blackburn 1971) or further non-cognitive judgments
(Blackburn 1984) expressed by the complex sentences. The hope is that
these judgments will have rational connections to the other judgments
that are likely to play a role in valid arguments. If all goes well, a
kind of pragmatic incoherence or irrationality will be involved when
someone accepts the judgments of a valid argument so analyzed while at
the same time rejecting the conclusion. Such a speaker would be in a
state similar to those uttering sentences of the sort that feature in
Moore&rsquo;s paradox, such as &lsquo;It is raining but I don&rsquo;t believe that
it is.&rsquo;</p>

<p>

A simple example of this sort of approach comes from Blackburn.
Conditionals express higher order attitudes towards accepting certain
conjunctions of attitudes. &ldquo;If lying is wrong, telling your
little brother to lie is wrong,&rdquo; (when sincerely uttered)
expresses approval of making disapproval of getting one&rsquo;s brother to
lie &ldquo;follow upon&rdquo; disapproval of lying.</p>

<blockquote>&hellip;Anyone holding this pair [the above attitude, plus
the attitude expressed by &lsquo;lying is wrong&rsquo;] must hold the
consequential disapproval: he is committed to disapproving of getting
little brother to lie, for if he does not his attitudes clash. He has a
fractured sensibility which cannot itself be an object of approval.
(Blackburn 1984, 195)</blockquote>

<p>

Logical entailments involving moral judgments are explained as
follows: A complete constellation of attitudes which includes the
attitudes expressed by the conditional and by the seemingly assertive
premises but not also including the attitude expressed by the
conclusion is irrational, because it goes against the purposes of
moral discourse. Somewhat more sophisticated ways of working out this
strategy can be found in several places, including further work by
Blackburn himself (1988b), but the basic idea is well exemplified in
this proposal. </p>

<p>

The proposal also well exemplifies the program of quasi-realism. By
displaying our practices of inference as making sense despite their
non-cognitivist roots, Blackburn hopes to vindicate those
practices. If the program goes through for enough of our standard ways
of speaking and reasoning, including the other embedded contexts not
currently under discussion, he hopes to show how we can &ldquo;earn
the right&rdquo; to talk as if these judgments are true.</p>

<p>

The logic of attitudes strategy has met with much resistance on the
part of cognitivists. It seems to many that the answer conflates
genuine inconsistency with mere pragmatic incoherence (Hale 1986;
Schueler 1988; Brighouse 1990; Zangwill 1992; van Roojen 1996). In
fact it might seem that this is obvious; if we define validity or
entailment in terms of truth preservation, arguments with purely
non-cognitive premises will not even be candidates for validity and
relations among them will not be entailments.</p>

<p>

This quick way of arguing that the strategy involves conflation is
probably too quick as these critics largely recognize. Even before
Geach raised his version of the challenge to non-cognitivism, Hare
pointed out that there can be relations between commands that are very
much like the logical relations between descriptive utterances, so
much like them that we would expect them to receive a common
explanation.  &lsquo;If it is raining, take an umbrella,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;If it is raining, you will take an umbrella,&rsquo; interact
logically with &lsquo;It is raining&rsquo; in very similar ways and
seemingly for similar reasons. This inspired Hare to invent a model of
linguistic meaning with two components. Recall that one,
the <em>phrastic</em>, represents a proposition or state of affairs,
and the other, the <em>neustic</em>, functions as something like a
force indicator, insofar as the neustic indicates what speech-act is
being performed with the phrastic. The proposition represented might
be asserted or denied, prescribed or proscribed, and so on (Hare 1952,
17&ndash;22). Hare hoped that the logical connectives could be
included as parts of the phrastic (Hare 1952, 21), so that a common
set of logical rules could be used to explain most of the standard
inferences in any mood using some standard logical principle relating
judgments involving those connectives.  Nevertheless he did include
some extra rules, such as a rule forbidding imperatival conclusions
based on premises that include no imperatives.</p>

<p>

The payoff was supposed to be a unification of logic for sentences in
various moods, including moral sentences which Hare thought were a
species of universal imperative. A full assessment of the adequacy of
the system would be beyond the scope of this entry. It is not obvious
how the proposal is supposed to work in full generality, and it is
hard to see how treating logical connectives solely as components of
the phrastics can do all the needed work. But the phenomenon that Hare
was pointing to &ndash; that the relations between certain imperatives
are very much like those between similar descriptions &ndash; gives
non-cognitivists a response to the objection that only genuinely
truth-apt judgments can stand in logical relations to one
another. While some have doubted the possibility of a logic of
imperatives (Ross 1944; Williams 1963) some contemporary theorists
still hope to put imperative logic on a firm foundation (Lemmon 1965;
Green 1997; Vranas 2008, 2010).  It is an interesting question how a
successful completion of that project will impact the debates over
embedding.</p>

<p>
Critics of explaining logic in terms of rational or pragmatic
relations between attitudes can grant Hare&rsquo;s basic point. That
prescriptions can stand in logical relations to one another does not
entail that pragmatic or similar coherence or incoherence forms the
basis of these relations. Furthermore, they argue, the reduction of
logical inconsistency to pragmatic inconsistency carries with it a
potential liability: it requires us to find the former whenever we
find the latter.  Those who employ the reduction are committed to
finding logical inconsistency in what seem to be merely
Moore-paradoxical sentences involving morality, such as
&lsquo;Laughing is wrong, but I don&rsquo;t believe that it is.&rsquo; If
other sentences may express the very same attitudes as moral sentences
express, these too will have to stand in the same logical relations to
other sentences that moral judgments expressive of those attitudes
do. That can force the theory to be highly revisionary of our ordinary
judgments about logical consistency and implication. For example, most
theorists regard Moore-paradoxical sentences as consistent but self
defeating. But if the Moore-paradoxicality of a set of moral attitudes
is supposed to justify counting moral judgements that express them as
inconsistent, we should regard these sentences as inconsistent. We
seem to have two unattractive options, treat all such sentences as
logically contradictory or limit the move to those with normative
content (van Roojen 1996).</p>

<p>There are ways to resist this line of objection (Weintraub 2011).
One is to be extra careful about the kind of expression that grounds
the assignment of attitudes as the semantic values of sentences
(Gibbard 2003, 75 ff.; Schroeder 2008a, 2008c at 28, 2011,70 ff.). Not
every sentence which expresses a higher order attitude in an everyday
sense of expression may stand in the semantic expression relation that
expressivists postulate. We&rsquo;ll look more closely of some of the more
sophisticated systematic approaches to these problems in the final
section of this supplement.
</p>

<p>
Many theorists skeptical of non-cognitivism have done some of their
best work to reconstruct the details of the suggested logic of
attitudes and assess their adequacy. By considering various
intuitively available judgments and applying the non-cognitivist
accounts to them they have aimed to uncover logical relations that are
not easily captured using this approach (Hale 1993, 354). Many of the
specific criticisms turn on the details of the particular proposals up
for assessment, but there are some more general complaints that seem
to recur.
</p>

<p>
  Perhaps the simplest criticism has to do with &ldquo;the negation
problem&rdquo; for expressivist theories. One datum to be explained is
the logical inconsistency of the sentences &ldquo;Murdering is
wrong,&rdquo; and its negation, &ldquo;Murdering is not wrong.&rdquo;
The attitudes-first approach does this by mapping each onto an
attitude which it expresses and then showing that the attitudes in
question are inconsistent or disagree with one another. Intuitively
the first sentence expresses disapproval of murdering.  The problem
now is to find an attitude incompatible with it and which plausibly is
expressed by the second sentence. And it turns out to be difficult to
find an attitude to do the job.  </p>

<p>
 There are three ways to negate the claim that Fred believes that
murder is wrong: </p>

<p class="indent">
(1) Fred does not believe that murdering is wrong.
<br/>
(2) Fred believes that not murdering is wrong.
<br/>
(3) Fred believes that murdering is not wrong.
</p>

<p>
Intuitively these ascribe different states of mind to Fred, and the
third ascribes the attitude expressed by our target sentence.  But
when we negate the attitude ascription constitutive of the simple
expressivist analysis (Fred disapproves of murdering) we don&rsquo;t have
enough candidate attitudes to capture all three. We have only:</p>

<p class="indent">
(1*) Fred does not disapprove of murdering. And,
<br/>
(2*) Fred disapproves of not murdering.
</p>

<p>
And these plausibly correspond to the first two attitudes towards
murder expressed in (1) and (2). But it is the third which ascribes
belief in the negation of the claim that murder is wrong, so we have
not yet got our explanation (Unwin 1999, 2001; Hale 2002; Dreier 2006;
Schroeder 2008b, 2008c).  </p>

<p>
 This is not to say that there are not ways forward for the
non-cognitivists (Dreier 2006, Horgan and Timmons 2006b, Schroeder
2008b, 2008c). One strategy is to back away from pragmatic incoherence
as the explanation of the inconsistency in question while sticking
with the idea that the basic explanatory resource is the
incompatibility of some attitudes with others. Horgan and Timmons
(2006b) postulate an infinite hierarchy of primitive inconsistency
relations between the attitudes which are expressed using the
sentences which we pre-theoretically regard as inconsistent.  For
example, they postulate that the attitude expressed by &lsquo;Lying is
wrong,&rsquo; is inconsistent with the attitude expressed by
&lsquo;Lying is not wrong&rsquo;. But they say no more to explain why
this is so. It is just a primitive fact about these attitudes (and
many others) that they have this sort of incompatibility.  The large
number of primitive incompatibilities postulated by the theory makes
critics worry that no real explanatory work is being done.  (Schroeder
2008b, 2008c) All should agree we would have a more unified account if
we could construct the story with fewer primative inconsistencies. But
theorists might have different views about how much primative
inconsistency is tolerable. Dreier (2006) suggests that
non-cognitivists might be able to give a plausible explanation of
inconsistency if they can find a way to distinguish between
indifference and indecision. And he makes some suggestions for how
that may be done using preference as the basic attitude. </p>

<h3>The minimalist maneuver</h3>

<p>

Some have suggested that minimalism or deflationism about truth or
truth aptness can ride to the rescue of non-cognitivists at this point
(Stoljar 1993; Horwich 1993).  If so, perhaps the non-cognitivist can
bypass the above debates. A very rough characterization of minimalism
about truth will hopefully suffice to explain.  Minimalist theories
are often presented by contrast with theories of truth according to
which truth is some sort of &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; relation or
property. For example correspondence theories which claim that truth
involves a real relation between truth-bearers and reality are often
cited as paradigm cases of a substantial theory of truth. Minimalists
about truth suggest that truth is not such a substantial
property. Others propound a version of minimalism by claiming that to
understand what truth is one need not grasp anything more substantial
than some rather minimal claims. These proponents suggest that the
minimal claims needed are insufficient to require anything very
substantial that all truths must have in common.  Different
minimalists formulate these claims in somewhat different ways: Some
suggest that what one needs to know is simply that calling a sentence
true is just to assert or affirm the sentence (Ramsey 1927).  Others
hold that sentences of the form &lsquo;S is true&rsquo; can generally
be replaced by &lsquo;S&rsquo;. Still others suggest that one has only
to accept the theory consisting of all the sentences of Tarski&rsquo;s
Schema T &ndash; &lsquo;S&rsquo; is true iff S &ndash; where the sentence
&lsquo;S&rsquo; is mentioned on the left hand side and used on the
right hand side. And others require that one accept all propositions
of the form: The proposition that P is true iff P (Horwich 1990,
18&ndash;22).  Some minimalists extend these accounts further to
proffer so-called &ldquo;minimal truth-conditions&rdquo;. Their idea
is that the T-schema tells us how to generate such conditions.  Just
as &lsquo;grass is green&rsquo; is true just in case grass is green,
&lsquo;nepotism is wrong&rsquo;is true just in case nepotism is
wrong. This, some minimalists believe, is all we need to know to
understand the truth-conditions of moral sentences. More would need to
be said to give a full explanation of deflationism about truth, but
this should suffice for our purposes. </p>

<p>

For more detail on minimalism see the entry on
 <a href="../truth-deflationary/index.html">deflationary theories of truth</a>.</p>

<p>

It should be reasonably obvious how deflationism about truth can help
with one sort of embedded context &ndash; those in which a moral
sentence follows &lsquo;It is true that.&rsquo; If expressivists can
give us an adequate account of a moral sentence, such as
&lsquo;Teasing the cat is wrong,&rsquo; then deflationism tells us
that the same account should be sufficient for sentences like
&lsquo;It is true that teasing the cat is wrong.&rsquo; But it has
been suggested that minimalism can provide help in other contexts as
well (Blackburn 1988; Stoljar 1993; Horwich 1993). The thought seems
to be that all it takes to solve the embedding problem is for it to be
appropriate to call moral sentences true, for those sentences to embed
grammatically in longer sentences in the usual ways, and lastly for us
to have a relatively clear set of conditions on the appropriate use of
the target sentences. Minimalism about truth secures the first
requirement so long as the target sentences are meaningful, the
indicative form of the relevant atomic moral sentences plus our
linguistic practices secure the second, and the positive
non-cognitivist proposal for the meanings of the terms brings along a
story about appropriate and inappropriate use. The motivating ideas
here may be as follows: We know how to explain the meanings of more
complicated truth-functional embeddings by showing how the truth
values of the whole are functions of the truth-values of the component
sentences.  Minimalism allows us to generate a minimal truth condition
for any meaningful indicative sentence, such as <em>&lsquo;Lying is
wrong&rsquo; is true iff lying is wrong.</em> So minimalism might put
the non-cognitivist in a position to make sense of sentences embedding
moral predications just as we make sense of any sentences embedding
any predications by building up from the truth conditions of the
component sentences. The minimalist non-cognitivist can then attempt
to avoid Geach&rsquo;s charge of equivocation by suggesting that the minimal
truth condition is the meaning of normative predications whether
asserted or embedded. The resulting position will be a version of
non-cognitivism so long as minimal truth conditions can be
distinguished from more robust truth conditions, and so long as the
negative non-cognitivist claims are construed in a more robust
non-minimal way (Stoljar 1993, 93). Alternatively non-cognitivists
might give up formulations of their favored contrast in terms of truth
and truth-aptness and employ robust notions of representation or
propertyhood. They can then deny the representational nature of moral
sentences or that they predicate properties, and contrast them with
other, fully cognitive discourse, while deploying minimalist truth and
minimalist truth-conditions to handle embeddings.</p>

<p>

Things may not be as easy as this for the minimalist
non-cognitivist. An example of Dreier&rsquo;s can be used to make the point.
He imagines a predicate, &lsquo;hiyo&rsquo;. The term is used in
getting someone&rsquo;s attention. It evolved in the following way: Early on
speakers would say &lsquo;Hiyo Bob!&rsquo; upon meeting up with Bob as
a way of getting Bob&rsquo;s attention. Soon the practice evolved further.
Speakers began to utter &lsquo;Bob is hiyo,&rsquo; to perform the same
speech act as they had previously performed by uttering &lsquo;Hiyo
Bob!&rsquo; Suppose now that a theorist wants to explain the meaning
of &lsquo;hiyo&rsquo;. The theorist can begin by presenting a speech
act account of that meaning &ndash; &lsquo;hiyo&rsquo; is used in the
speech act of accosting someone. The theorist then adds to this
explanation an inference-rule account of the meanings of sentential
connectives, such as &lsquo;and&rsquo;, &lsquo;or&rsquo;, &lsquo;if
&hellip; then&rsquo;. The sentence, &lsquo;Bob is hiyo&rsquo; is well
formed, and it embeds grammatically in longer sentences. The theorist
has explained the functioning of those longer sentences by specifying
via inference-rules how they interact with yet further sentences to
mediate inference. It would thus seem that the account is on a par
with those versions of non-cognitivism which try to use minimalism by
itself to solve the embedding problem. If those accounts are adequate
we should know what &lsquo;If Bob is hiyo, then there is a dingo
about,&rsquo; means. But, Dreier suspects we won&rsquo;t know and he
concludes that the same holds for the parallel strategy with respect
to moral utterances. More than what minimalism provides will be needed
to elucidate the meanings of normative predications in such embedded
contexts (Dreier 1996a, 42&ndash;44). At this stage of the literature,
it remains controversial what more, if anything, is needed, but the
general point is quite powerful (Sinnott-Armstrong 2000).</p>

<h3>Using descriptive content in a hybrid theory,</h3>

<p>
We&rsquo;ve noted that skeptics about the expressivist program often
complain that logical relations are first and foremost relations
between the contents of attitudes and sentences that express
them. Non-cognitivists can grant this point if one of several
strategies that combine a logic of attitudes with a logic of their
contents can be made to work.  There are several different ways this
might be accomplished.
</p>

<p>
One alternative, hybrid expressivism, uses the alleged descriptive
component of the meanings of moral judgments to generate most of the
required logical relations. We noted earlier that non-cognitivists
have long granted evaluative utterances and thoughts some secondary
&ldquo;descriptive meaning&rdquo; and that hybrid theorists have gone
on to give that descriptive meaning nearly co-equal status.  One
motivation for such views is the present one: Hybrid theorists hope to
explain logical relations by using the descriptive component of
meaning to do much of the work.</p>

<p>

According to this approach moral terms have descriptive content and
that content is a property.  Hybrid theorists don&rsquo;t all agree on what
that property is, nor do they agree on how it is determined by the
semantics or even on whether it is determined by the semantics as
opposed to pragmatics.  On one influential implementation of the
hybrid strategy the property is determined by the actual moral
attitudes of the speaker. If the speaker morally approves of all and
only sweet things, then this property is sweetness. An ordinary
judgment that such and such is right might then predicate
sweetness. If the speaker morally disapproves of all and only the sour
things then her judgments of wrongness predicate sourness as the
descriptive meaning of &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;. And so on. In embedded
contexts, this secondary component becomes the semantic value of the
embedded moral expression. &lsquo;If lying is wrong, then he will
lie,&rsquo; has an antecedent whose embedded content is the same as a
statement predicating the property on which the speaker&rsquo;s moral
disapproval supervenes. Thus, continuing with our example, the
sentence says the same thing as, &lsquo;If lying is sour, then he will
lie.&rsquo; And the content of this conditional will interact with the
secondary descriptive meaning of the unembedded moral judgments to
determine its logical functioning so that we get the implications we
would expect.  Differing proposals of this general sort say somewhat
different things about exactly how the descriptive content is
expressed.  (Barker 2000; Ridge 2006a; Ridge 2006b) or quasi-expressed
(Jackson 1999), but the basic idea is worked out in similar ways.</p>

<p>Hybrid theorists of this sort then propose to use the descriptive
contents contributed by moral terms and moral sentences to explain the
logical relations between these.  Since moral predicates can
contribute descriptive content of just the sort that cognitivists
postulate, inconsistencies between the descriptive contents expressed
will occur whenever cognitivism would predict inconsistency.  But more
needs to be done to get <em>entailments</em> wherever descriptivism
would predict it. Insofar as normative conclusions are hybrid, the
logic of just the descriptive components doesn&rsquo;t ensure that the
non-cognitive component is entailed wherever we have an intuitively
valid argument (Schroeder 2009, 268 ff). The simplest suggestion is
to have the normative terms contribute a constant non-cognitive
attitude where ever they occur. The result, if all goes according to
plan, is a logic for normative terms which generates all the
entailments that would be generated if moral terms contributed only
descriptive content.</p>

<p>Cognitivists have raised doubts about the adequacy of these
proposals due to the manner in which the descriptive meaning is
determined. If it is the actual attitudes of the speaker that
determine the property, a speaker may not use the same term to pick
out the same property on each occasion of use. For attitudes can
change.  They might even change quickly and this can lead to worries
about the validity of arguments that employ moral terms. A speaker may
have the relevant attitude towards one property when she considers
earlier premises, only to change her attitude during the course of the
overall argument. Thus Geach&rsquo;s original charge of equivocation might
still be appropriate in some circumstances (van Roojen 2005; Schroeder
2009). Furthermore, it isn&rsquo;t at all obvious how moral terms thus
construed can be used to communicate the descriptive property that is
a component of the semantic value, unless we presuppose that the
audience knows a lot about the speakers moral attitudes. In fact, it
isn&rsquo;t clear how they can communicate the specific attitude expressed
either, if its object and hence its content differs from speaker to
speaker as many of these views allow (Schroeder 2009). Hybrid
theorists have, of course, resisted these complaints (Alm 2007, Ridge
2007; Eriksson 2010).
</p>

<p>The aforementioned worries can be used to motivate a different
implementation of the hybrid idea, one which takes slurs or epithets
as a model. One such proposal suggests that simple slurs and moral
statements in the indicative mode conventionally express two states of
mind &ndash; a belief that the subject of which the term is predicated
has a certain property and a pro or con attitude towards such
subjects. These views differ from those discussed immediately above in
holding that the descriptive properties picked out by the moral terms
don&rsquo;t vary depending on the speaker&rsquo;s attitudes.  Rather, as with
slurs, there are supposed to be a nonvariable descriptive content as
determined semantically. Proponents of this kind of view often suggest
that the mechanism whereby the nondescriptive meaning gets
communicated is analogous to conventional implicature (Copp 2001,
2009; Boisvert 2008). The details vary between different
implementations of the idea, at least partly because there is
controversy about conventional implicature (Bach 1999). In any case,
the overall suggestion is that insofar as the descriptive contents are
just what a cognitivist would take them to be, the logical relations
among the descriptive components of meaning for any set of statements
would stand in the relations they need to stand for a non-revisionary
logic for moral terms and sentences.</p>

<p>
The remaining task is to ensure that the non-cognitive component plays
by rules that do not either leave part of a normative conclusion
unsupported or cause incoherence in the non-cognitive side in such a
way as to generate inconsistency where there seems to be none. Again,
the simplest way to secure the first desideratum is to let each
normative term always contribute the same non-cognitive element to
what is expressed (Boisvert 2008; Schroeder 2009, 2010). Then a
normative term used in a set of premises will already express the
normative content the term expresses in the conclusion. This is
actually a pretty strict requirement. It doesn&rsquo;t mean just that the
term must express the same attitude type on each occurrence; it also
requires that the attitude take the same object.  For example, if the
conclusion of an argument expresses a con attitude toward lying it is
not sufficient that one of the premises expresses that attitude
towards cheating.  It must express that attitude towards lying so that
the premises commit the speaker to the attitude expressed by the
conclusion. </p>

<p>The simple strategy does raise some questions.  It seems intuitive
that belief reports don&rsquo;t express attitudes but rather report the
subject has the attitude that would be expressed by the complement of
&ldquo;So and so believes that &hellip;&rdquo; In as much as
non-cognitivists want to use their commitments to help explain
internalism this is a result non-cognitivists have independent reason
to endorse. If we want to explain why Sarah, who thinks that cursing
is wrong should be expected not to curse, it is her attitude and not
the attitude of the person attributing it to her that will do the
explanatory work.  But this feature is arguably not shared by
slurs &ndash; a slur in a belief report is generally taken to express
the negative attitude of the speaker and not the person whose beliefs
are being reported (Schroeder 2010, 201ff). And it may be that
expressives in general &ndash; that is terms which conventionally
express an attitude &ndash; function to express the speaker&rsquo;s attitudes
even in belief reports and in indirect quotation (Potts 2005; Bach
2006). If so, that is some reason to doubt that moral terms could
function as such expressives while working as required in belief
reports.
</p>

<h3>Attitudes and contents, revisited.</h3>

<p>Allan Gibbard&rsquo;s two related proposals (Gibbard 1990, 2003) and Mark
Schroeder&rsquo;s <em>Being For</em> (2008c) constitute the most sustained
assaults on the embedding problem to date. Both pay special attention
to compositionality.  That is they aim for the sort of generality that
would enable a unified and systematic treatment of judgements
including normative judgement that extends easily to more complex
constructions. Each is thus worth some individual scrutiny on its own
terms.</p>

<p>
Gibbard&rsquo;s two proposals were partly designed to solve the embedding
problem. Gibbard suggests we can use an extension of possible worlds
semantics to capture normative contents consistent with his norm
expressivist analysis. The extension generates a set of world-norm
pairs by pairing each possible world with each possible set of
consistent and complete norms. Consistent complete sets of norms
divide naturalistically described act-types into those which are
permitted, required, or forbidden in such a way that no action can be
both required or permitted and also forbidden. Sets of these pairs are
then used to represent the contents of moral judgments. On Gibbard&rsquo;s
preferred way of doing this, particular judgments rule out sets of
these pairs. For example, judging an action forbidden will rule out
any pair in which the world member of the pair represents the action
as satisfying a complete naturalistic description which is not
sufficient to classify an action as forbidden according to the set of
norms forming the second member. The set of the remaining pairs which
the judgments do not rule out represent the contents of the
judgments.</p>

<p>

From here the approach is further extended to handle the contents of
conjunctions, disjunctions, and conditionals and to explain how these
interact logically. Contents of conjunctions are the intersections of
the sets representing their conjuncts. Contents of disjunctions are
the unions of the sets representing the contents of the
disjuncts. Contents of conditionals will be the union of the set
representing the negation of the antecedent and the set representing
the consequent. Judgments are inconsistent if the intersection of
their contents is empty.  Arguments are valid if the premises are
inconsistent with the denial of the conclusion (Gibbard 1990, chapter
5). A parallel structure works in basically the same way in Gibbard
(2003) where plans take the place of norms.  So both systems do a
relatively nice job of capturing the logical relations between
judgements involving the logical connectives, though there is still
dispute on its adequacy to deal with negation as discussed above
(Dreier 2006; Schroeder 2008b, 2008c).</p>

<p>Because the connectives are defined as functions that operate on
the contents of the judgements they connect, Gibbard&rsquo;s work presents a
strategy for producing a semantics that delivers contents for all the
more complex constructions.  At the same time it also gives us a sense
of which attitude each judgement expresses in virtue of Gibbard&rsquo;s
employment of the analogy with possible worlds semantics.  Just as
believing that <i>P</i> is ruling out possible worlds in the
complement of the set that represents <i>P</i>, accepting a
plan <i>Q</i> is ruling out those world-plan pairs that
exclude <i>Q</i>. Accepting the complex
<i>P</i> iff <i>Q</i> rules
out accepting world-plan pairs that have one without the other. The
story looks like it might generate a logic of attitudes from the logic
of the contents of those attitudes.  That idea looks particularly
promising if one thinks that the moral of Geach and Searle&rsquo;s
objections is that we must distinguish attitudes from the contents of
the sentences that express them. That seems to have been Searle&rsquo;s
verdict when he accused non-cognitivists of committing the
&ldquo;speech act fallacy.&rdquo; He thought that sentences bear their
logical relations to one another in virtue of their contents, and not
in virtue of the speech act that they are used to accomplish (Searle
1962). Gibbard&rsquo;s sets of world-norm pairs treated as the contents of
moral sentences, looks to allow non-cognitivists to make the relevant
distinctions (Dreier 1998). The suggestion is especially attractive in
light of the fact that Gibbard&rsquo;s apparatus can be adapted to work with
any model theory for propositional attitudes that a theorist might use
to replace possible worlds (Dreier 1999).</p>

<p>

If the world-norm pair apparatus is used to generate genuine contents
for the judgments in question &ndash; contents which are independent of
the force with which sentences are used and which explain the logical
relations among them, it might be worrisome that the contents are not
distinctively non-cognitivist. Ruling out a norm might be a cognitive
state for all the formal apparatus requires. World-norm pairs could be
used to capture the thoughts of a moral realist who believes that
there are genuine moral properties supervening on the natural
properties of the world. The possible worlds component of the model
would represent beliefs about the supervenience base, while the norms
or plans would be needed to represent a person&rsquo;s beliefs involving the
supervenient moral properties. On this proposal the norms or plans are
needed to represent the contents of the realist&rsquo;s thought because
different realist theories might have the moral properties supervene
on different nonmoral properties and a person could be a realist
without being committed to the truth of any particular realist
theory. An opinionated realist might have views about the exact
supervenience relation which would be represented by a set of pairs in
which the second member &ndash; the norms or plans &ndash; was the same
for each pair in the set. But a less opinionated realist might have
her beliefs represented by a set in which the second member
varied. Similarly, but in a somewhat different way, indexical
relativism can make use of the apparatus to represent moral beliefs
consistent with its analysis (Dreier 1999).</p>

<p>We noted above that negation raises some of the thorniest embedding
issues.  There may or may not be such a problem with Gibbard&rsquo;s
treatment of negation. Gibbard glosses negation of the judgement that
X is permissible as an attitude of ruling out a set of lower order
attitudes, those involved in the various plans to do X.  And this may
involve collapsing the distinction between plans as contents and plans
as attitudes.  In any case, Schroeder (2008b, 2008c) suggests that
Gibbard has not quite succeeded in constructing a logic of attitudes
which involves just one kind of attitude directed at various contents.
Recall that Schroeder distinguishes A-type and B-type inconsistency
with the former involving just one sort of attitude which inherits its
consistency or inconsistency from the consistency or inconsistency of
its content. Schroeder believes A-type inconsistency to be the most
familiar. And he thinks it is the best candidate for providing an
expressivist explanation of the logical relations moral judgements
enter into. Schroeder&rsquo;s <em>Being For</em> (2008c) is an attempt to
work out such an account and assess it&rsquo;s adequacy.</p>

<p>Once one opts for an A-type account, it becomes clear that it would
be helpful to have some additional structure to capture the logical
relations among judgements involving negation and so on. Schroeder
suggests an expressivist can generate such structure by complicating
the story about what the attitudes in question are attitudes
towards. The specific proposal is to that &lsquo;lying is wrong&rsquo;
(for example) expresses a non-cognitive attitude not directly towards
lying but towards <em>blaming for</em> lying. Adding this extra
structure into the attitudes creates more places to fill with
negations and promises to generate the full range of attitudes it
seems a person can have.  Recall that here are three ways to negate
the claim that Fred believes that murder is wrong: </p>

<p class="indent">
(1) Fred does not believe that murdering is wrong.
<br/>
(2) Fred believes that not murdering is wrong.
<br/>
(3) Fred believes that murdering is not wrong.
</p>

<p>If <em>being for</em> is the attitude exploited by the account
(attributed by &lsquo;is for&rsquo;), we can generate four distinct
attitudes towards blaming for murdering:</p>

<p class="indent">
(0*) Fred is for blaming for murdering.<br/>
(1*) Fred is not for blaming for murdering.<br/>
(2*) Fred is for blaming for not murdering.<br/>
(3*) Fred is for not blaming for murdering.
</p>

<p>
Just as someone who accepts that murdering is wrong disagrees with
someone such as Fred as described by (3) who believes it is not wrong,
the attitude attributed by (0*) seems to be inconsistent with that
attributed by (3*). And the inconsistency seems to be of type-A as
Schroeder intended (Schroeder 2008b, 2008c 59 ff).  From this
beginning Schroeder argues the approach can be extended to a plausible
account of sentences with normative contents joined by various logical
connectives.  Natural language includes sentences embedding both
normative and non-normative atomic sentences.  These require
additional work to tame. Without going into too much detail it should
be apparent that a commitment to reducing all inconsistency to A-type
inconsistency must require such sentences to express the same
non-cognitive attitude as normative utterances.  And it must also
extend the approach back to simple non-normative sentences as well.
For it is a commitment of the A-type approach that we work with one
attitude whose logical relations are inherited from that of the
contents.  There is something a bit ironic about this given the
motivations for non-cognitivism, which started out postulating a
divide between normative and descriptive language. In any case,
Schroeder suggests that believing P comes to <em>being for proceeding
as if P</em>, in cases where P is representational (2008c). </p>

<p>
As it turns out, the added structure required to handle evaluative
negation causes trouble when applied to representational judgements
and the solution involves postulating two different contents for
atomic representational judgements. The belief that <i>P</i> must
express a state of being for both <em>proceeding as if P</em> and
for <em>not proceeding as if not P</em>. This tweak in turn requires
parallel dual contents in normative judgements.  This is accomplished
trivially by just doubling the very same content already expressed.
All of this extra work is required so as to remain with the A-type
approach. And it engenders Schroeder&rsquo;s name for the proposal,
&ldquo;bifurcated attitude semantics&rdquo; (Schroeder 2008c). </p>
  
<p>So goes an outline of the basic theory. It is still unclear how
much further the overall approach can be extended. Schroeder&rsquo;s
prediction at the end of the book is somewhat pessimistic (2008c, 177
ff).  He suggests that there will be trouble extending the treatment
to tense, modals and quantifiers and that this spells trouble for
expressivism. The advocates of expressivism have also been pessimistic
about prospects for bifurcated attitude semantics, suggesting that it
is not the way forward. They typically disagree with Schroeder about
the merits of a type-A strategy committed to working with one basic
non-cognitive attitude type (Horgan and Timmons 2009; Mabrito 2009;
Richard 2011). They suggest instead that extant B-type semantic
theories will turn out to be adequate. Debate of these issues
continues to be robust with much of the argument turning on issues
which require a great deal of attention to detail.</p>

<p>
Many non-cognitivists have remained unimpressed with cognitivist
complaints about embedding (Blackburn 1998, 72). In fact it appears
that there is not really even agreement on what the problem is. While
some consider it an adequacy condition on any solution to the
embedding problem that it vindicate certain inferences as valid,
others think that the task is to explain why we reason as we do
(Bj&ouml;rnsson 2001), or perhaps why it is rational to reason as we
do. And they may suggest that this last verdict is itself just one
more non-cognitive judgment.</p>

<p>

Fictionalism promises to bypass much of this debate while defending
psychological non-cognitivism. Recall that hermeneutic fictionalists
accept psychological non-cognitivism, but reject semantic
nonfactualism.  Thus the semantics of moral sentences is just as the
realist says it is. Moral sentences do predicate properties both in
their free-standing uses and when embedded (MacIntyre 1981; Kalderon
2005b). Hence such fictionalist postulates no equivocation and can use
whatever a realist is entitled to use to explain relations of
implications between contents. The fictionalist would be free from the
task of solving Geach&rsquo;s problem taken as the task of explaining why
modus ponens and other forms of inference validly apply to moral
sentences (Kalderon 2005b, 2008a, 2008b). But she does shoulder the
related task of making sense of moral reasoning, and of explaining the
point of fictive use of moral sentences. In this latter task she
claims to have at her disposal many of the resources and arguments
proposed by fully non-cognitivist theories. Where this leaves the
overall argument has been the subject of some debate.  Kalderon claims
that quasi-realist interpretations of moral thought can be
appropriated to make sense of our use of the relevant terms. But
critics suggest that if these explanations turnout to be adequate
quasi-realists would be able to solve the Frege-Geach problems on
their own terms (Eklund 2007, 2009; Lenman 2008).  A relevant issue
seems to be whether the logical relations among the attitudes
expressed must be the same as the logical relationships that hold
among the sentences used to express them.  And this in turn may depend
on the nature of the expression relation posited in deploying the
strategy. An expressivist semantics requires a one-one mapping of
non-synonymous sentences to states of mind, but insofar as
fictionalism doesn&rsquo;t require a nonstandard semantics it may be able to
get away with a looser connection between the mental states and the
sentences that express them.</p>

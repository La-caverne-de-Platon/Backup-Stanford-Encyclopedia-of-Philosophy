<h2>Bridge Principle &ndash; Surveying the Options</h2>

<p>
Arguably, the viability of the claim that logical consequence imposes
systematic normative constraints upon our belief system hinges on
whether there is a defensible bridge principle. But how are we to
decide whether a bridge principle is up to the job? One crucial test
consists in how a bridge principle fares in the face of the objections
presented in
 <a href="index-2.html#Obje">&sect;3.1</a>.
 In addition, MacFarlane (MF2004: 12) advances the following
desiderata:</p>

<ul>

<li id="strictnesstest"><span><strong>The Strictness
Test:</strong></span> At least when it comes to ordinary, readily
recognizable logical implications leading to conclusions that the
agent has reason to consider, there is something amiss about an agent
who endorses the premises but fails to believe the conclusion. Such an
agent is &ldquo;not entirely as she ought to be&rdquo;. The Strictness
Test delivers a prima facie strike against reason-based bridge
principles. According to such bridge principles, my reasons for being
logically coherent may be overridden by other reasons. In such
situations I violate Strictness. (MacFarlane&rsquo;s criterion is
inspired by Broome 2000: 85.) </li>

<li id="priorityquestion">

<p>
<span><strong>The Priority Question</strong></span>: The attitudinal
variants have a distinctive advantage when it comes to dealing with
 <a href="index-2.html#objexcessive">Excessive Demands</a>
 worries. But relativizing one&rsquo;s logical obligations to, say,
one&rsquo;s logical beliefs or one&rsquo;s logical knowledge invites
problems of its own, according to
 MacFarlane.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-supp1" id="ref-1">S1</a>]</sup>
 The problem according to MacFarlane is that </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
we seek logical knowledge so that we will know how we ought to revise
our beliefs: not just how we will be obligated to revise them when we
acquire this logical knowledge, but how we are obligated to revise
them even now, in our state of ignorance. (MF2004: 12) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In other words, according to this intuition it is the facts about
logical consequence that constrain our doxastic attitudes regardless
of whether we are able to recognize them.</p> </li>

<li id="logicalobtuseness">

<p>
<span><strong>Logical Obtuseness</strong></span>: Suppose someone
professes to believe \(A\) and \(B\), but refuses to take a stand on
(neither believes nor disbelieves) the conjunction \(A \land B\).
Intuitively, such a person is liable to criticism. Principles with
negative polarity allow for breaches of Obtuseness. So long as the
agent does not actively <em>disbelieve</em> \(A \land B\), our
negative bridge principles find no fault with cases like these. If
this intuition carries any weight, negative principles may ultimately prove to be too weak.</p> </li>
</ul>

<p>
As is already becoming apparent, our desiderata are at times in
tension with one another. For instance, the
 <a href="#strictnesstest">Strictness Test</a>
 favors ought-based principles, whereas
 <a href="index-2.html#objexcessive">Excessive Demands</a>
 and the Preface Paradox tell against them and hence pull in the
opposite direction. As things stand, there can thus be no one bridge
principle that satisfies all of them. Consequently, in evaluating our
bridge principles against these criteria, we will need to decide on
the relative importance of our various desiderata. Each principle will
be assessed according to how well it performs when judged against the
appropriately weighted desiderata. The principle (or group of
principles) that performs best across the board takes the prize. At
least this is the route taken by MacFarlane (MF2004) and, with respect
to a slightly different set of desiderata, Field (2009a).</p>

<p>
Let us take
 <a href="index-2.html#exIMP">IMP</a>
 (aka Co+) as our point of departure again. As we have already
observed,
 <a href="index-2.html#exIMP">IMP</a>
 falls victim both to the
 <a href="index-2.html#objnoguidance">No Guidance Objection</a>
 and the
 <a href="index-2.html#objbootstrap">Bootstrapping Objection</a>.
 A natural reaction in light of these failings is to retreat to the
weaker reason operator, thus giving rise to the following two
principles (and their various attitudinally constrained
counterparts):</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="excrp"><span class="tag"> (Cr+) </span><span class="sen"> If
\(A_{1}, \dots, A_{n}\models C\), then if \(S\) believes all the
\(A_{i}\), \(S\) <em>has (defeasible) reason</em> to believe
\(C\).</span> </li>

<li id="excrm"><span class="tag">(Cr&minus;) </span><span class="sen">
If \(A_{1}, \dots, A_{n}\models C\), then if \(S\) believes all the
\(A_{i}\), \(S\) <em>has (defeasible) reason</em> not to disbelieve
\(C\).</span> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Though this move does show some initial promise, this group of narrow
scope principles does not ultimately succeed either. While, arguably,
the (Cr)s are immune to the
 <a href="index-2.html#objnoguidance">No Guidance Objection</a>,
 things look less promising when it comes to Bootstrapping. According
to the (Cr)s, believing \(A\) automatically gives rise to a reason to
believe \(A\). Many will view this kind of (partial)
auto-justification with some suspicion.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-supp2" id="ref-2">S2</a>]</sup>
 What is more, almost by definition, the (Cr)s violate the
 <a href="#strictnesstest">Strictness Test</a>.</p>
 
<p>
Let us turn to the Bs. The Bs, recall, are characterized by the fact
that deontic operators act both on the antecedent and on the
consequent of the embedded conditional. But these two deontic
operators are generally underwritten by norms stemming from different
sources. For simplicity, let us focus on (Bo+) (the discussion to
follow generalizes to the remaining Bs). In the embedded conditional
&ldquo;if \(S\) ought to believe all the \(A_{i}\), \(S\) ought to
believe \(C\)&rdquo;, the <em>ought</em> in the antecedent has its
source in whatever epistemic norms make it the case that \(S\) ought
to believe the \(A_{i}\) (we may assume that the \(A_{i}\) are not
themselves acquired by logical inference and so the norms in question
will not themselves be logical or logic-induced). It is in virtue of
their compliance with this norm that the premises enjoy a positive
epistemic status. \(C\)&rsquo;s positive epistemic status, by
contrast, may only be derivative; it may be inherited by dint of
\(C\)&rsquo;s logical relation to the \(A_{i}\). Thus, on this picture
the normative force of logical consequence resides in its ability to
propagate whatever epistemic goodness the premises might enjoy to
their logical consequences. For example, the \(B\)-principle</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="exbpp"><span class="tag">(Bp+)</span><span class="sen"> If
\(A_{1}, \dots, A_{n}\models C\), then if \(S\) may believe all the
\(A_{i}\), then \(S\) may believe \(C\).</span> </li>
</ul>

<p>
could be based on an evidential norm, which might constitute the source of the
agent&rsquo;s permission to believe the \(A_{i}\):</p>

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="exEN"><span class="tag">(EN)</span><span class="sen">\(S\) may
believe \(A\) if only if \(A\) is sufficiently likely in light of the
evidence.</span> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Thus, the reason why \(S\) may believe the \(A_{i}\) may be given by
 <a href="#exEN">(EN)</a>:
 it is because all of the \(A_{i}\) enjoy the necessary evidential
support.
 <a href="#exbpp">(Bp+)</a>
 then states that one may believe the logical consequences of the
propositions one is permitted to believe on account of their evidential support.</p>

<p>
As a result of this, the Bs, unlike the Cs, are immune to the
 <a href="index-2.html#objnoguidance">No Guidance</a>
 worry as well as to the
 <a href="index-2.html#objbootstrap">Bootstrapping Objection</a>.
 That is not to say, however, that the Bs do not face potential
difficulties of their own. The chief drawback, according to
MacFarlane, is that the Bs are too weak: &ldquo;according to the Bs,
logical consequence is a channel through which existing norms of
belief (obligation, permission, reason) can be
<em>extended</em>&rdquo; (MF2004: 10, the emphasis is the author&rsquo;s). (Bo+),
for instance, says that <em>if</em> you ought to believe the
\(A_{i}\), you ought to believe their (joint) entailments. But if it
is not the case that you ought to believe the premises, it provides
little guidance as to what you should do. And therein lies the source
of MacFarlane&rsquo;s worry: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
according to the Bs, then, logic is only normative for those whose
beliefs are already in order&mdash;that is, for those who believe what
they ought to believe (or may believe, or have reason to believe). To
the unfortunate others, logical norms simply do not apply. (MF2004: 10)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now, the Bs do offer <em>some</em> guidance. After all, according to
(Bo+), for instance, upon discovering that an unacceptable proposition
\(C\) follows from my belief that \(A\), I can immediately conclude
that it is not the case that I ought to believe \(A\). Nevertheless,
it may be felt that one should be bound by logic even when one has
beliefs one ought not to have. That is, it might be
thought that it would constitute an <em>additional</em> strike against
an agent whose beliefs are not in good order, if he failed to be
logically coherent. It is a legitimate question, however, whether
logic really is normative in this way. We will return to this question
in
 <a href="index-2.html#KoloChal">&sect;5.1</a>.</p>
 
<p>
This brings us to the Ws. The Ws have considerable intuitive upside,
which have earned them a number of followers. Broome (2013) appears to
go in for a weak attitudinal restriction of
 <a href="#exwop">(Wo+)</a>.
 Sainsbury (2002) seems to advocate an attitudinal restriction of
(Wr&minus;), while Streumer (2007) adopts a version of unrestricted
(Wr&minus;). MacFarlane (MF2004)
himself settles on a combination of (Wo&minus;) and (Wr+). However,
not all of the \(W\)s are contenders. The (Wp)s, for one, are out of
contention for being too weak. The (Wp)s imply that I have permission
to see to it that if I believe \(A\) and \(B\), I also believe \(A
\land B\), but this does not even so much as provide me with a reason
to believe the latter when I believe the former. As MacFarlane puts
it, &ldquo;the difference between the (Wp)s and the position that
there are no logical norms for belief seems slim indeed&rdquo;
(MF2004: 10). Let us therefore focus on the remaining Ws. For
simplicity, let us begin by considering
 <a href="#exwop">(Wo+)</a>:</p>
 

<ul class="sentag tag3em">

<li id="exwop"><span class="tag">(Wo+) </span><span class="sen"> If
\(A_{1}, \dots, A_{n}\models C\), then \(S\) ought to (if \(S\)
believes all the \(A_{i}\), \(S\) believes \(C\)).</span> </li>
</ul>

<p>

 <a href="#exwop">(Wo+)</a>
 elegantly dodges both the
 <a href="index-2.html#objnoguidance">No Guidance</a>
 and the
 <a href="index-2.html#objbootstrap">Bootstrapping Objection</a>.
 As for the former, the wide-scope reading provides just the wiggle
room needed to neutralize Harman&rsquo;s objection: suppose I believe
\(A\) and \(A\supset B\). According to
 <a href="#exwop">(Wo+)</a>,
 I may meet my logical obligations in one of two ways: by either
retaining my beliefs and also coming to believe \(B\), <em>or</em> by
ditching at least one of my antecedent beliefs in \(A\) and \(A
\supset B\) so as to absolve me from the obligation to believe \(B\).
When \(B\) turns out to be untenable, the latter course of action
recommends itself: we revise our beliefs in light of their
unpalatable consequences. This not only meets Harman&rsquo;s
challenge; it paints an attractive picture of the interplay between
logic and other epistemic norms: logic, on the whole, does not require
us to have any particular beliefs (except logical truths, perhaps).
Rather it prohibits certain constellations of doxastic attitudes. When
we reason we must negotiate these global constraints on our system of
beliefs with other epistemic norms&mdash;local norms that guide us in
determining whether a given proposition is to be believed. This
element of negotiation is well captured by the wide-scope reading.</p>

<p>
Moreover, provided one is willing to accept that deontic modals are
best read as propositional operators,
 <a href="#exwop">(Wo+)</a>
 is untroubled by Broome&rsquo;s reflexivity worries. It yields that,
for any proposition \(A\) that I happen to believe, I ought to
(believe \(A\) or not to believe \(A\)).</p>

<p>
Things look less rosy when we consider
 <a href="#exwop">(Wo+)</a>&rsquo;s
 performance with respect to some of the other desiderata. It requires
us to have an attitude (namely the attitude of believing) towards
<em>any</em> consequence of the beliefs I retain, thus placing
 <a href="index-2.html#objexcessive">Excessive Demands</a>
 on us. Moving to (Wo&minus;) avoids not only that problem, but also
that of
 <a href="index-2.html#objclutteravoid">Clutter Avoidance</a>.
 It does not, however, stave off the Preface problem. What is more, as
a principle of negative polarity (Wo&minus;) faces the
 <a href="#logicalobtuseness">Logical Obtuseness</a>
 problem.</p>

<p>
We could alternatively try our luck with an attitudinal principle. To
fix ideas, let us opt for</p>

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li id="exwopb"><span class="tag">(Wo+b) </span><span class="sen"> If
\(S\) believes that \(A_{1}, \dots, A_{n}\models C\), then \(S\) ought
to (if \(S\) believes all the \(A_{i}\), \(S\) believes \(C\)).</span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The upside is that
 <a href="#exwopb">(Wo+b)</a>
 takes care of the problem of
 <a href="index-2.html#objexcessive">Excessive Demands</a>.
 It does not, however, take care of
 <a href="index-2.html#objclutteravoid">Clutter Avoidance</a>.
 At least not as it stands. To fix this, we could further try the
following <em>addendum</em>:</p>

<ul class="sentag tag4em">

<li id="exwopbs"><span class="tag">(Wo+b*) </span><span class="sen">
If \(S\) believes that \(A_{1}, \dots, A_{n}\models C\) and \(S\)
considers \(C\) or has independent reason to consider \(C\), then \(S\) ought to
(if \(S\) believes all the \(A_{i}\), \(S\) believes
 \(C\)).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-supp3" id="ref-3">S3</a>]</sup>
 </span> </li>
</ul>

<p>
However, even if the amended principle successfully wards off
 <a href="index-2.html#objclutteravoid">Clutter Avoidance</a>,
 it remains vulnerable to Preface Paradox-type considerations.</p>

<p>
To deal with it, we could weaken our wide scope principle by replacing
the strict <em>ought</em> operator by the defeasible <em>reason</em>
operator. The thought is that one&rsquo;s reasons for being logically
coherent may be trumped in Preface-like situations. We will return to
this point in the next section. Let us note already, however, that
such a non-strict principle arguably solves the
 <a href="index-2.html#objexcessive">Excessive Demands</a>
 problems. To deal with
 <a href="index-2.html#objclutteravoid">Clutter Avoidance</a>,
 the principle can be modified along the lines of
 <a href="#exwopbs">(Wo+b*)</a>,
 to yield the analogous (Wr+b*). However, as we noted, principles of
this type fail to meet the
 <a href="#strictnesstest">Strictness Test</a>.  But perhaps the
lesson to be learned just is that the normative force of logic is
non-strict. This bitter pill would be considerably sweetened
if <em>reason</em>-based principles really did offer a way around the
Preface Paradox. </p>

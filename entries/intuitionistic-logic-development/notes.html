 One will want to impose various (structural) constraints on the

 This is subjective time (one may think here of Husserl&rsquo;s notion
of inner time consciousness) rather than objective or scientific time
(time as it figures in physics and that one measures with a clock);
the latter, according to Brouwer, presupposes mathematics (Brouwer
1907: 99n.2 [1975: 61n.2]).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

 The <em>Collected Works</em> have &ldquo;Formal language accompanies
mathematics as the weather-map accompanies the atmospheric
processes&rdquo; instead (Brouwer 1975: 451), but that translation was
based on the book version of the so-called signific dialogues (Brouwer
et al. 1939), not on the original publication in the journal
<em>Synthese</em> (Brouwer et al. 1937). The book was edited by
Mannoury, but it is not clear who changed the simile. To my mind, the
original is better, because a symphony is also a construction.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 See Brouwer 1924N: 2 [van Heijenoort 1967: 336]; 1929A: 423&ndash;424
[Mancosu 1998: 49&ndash;50]; 1949C: 492; 1952B: 510&ndash;511.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 According to Van Dalen (1999: 106&ndash;107), it is likely that
Brouwer (who entered university in 1897) learned this interpretation
of PEM directly or indirectly from the teacher of logic at Amsterdam
University at the time, C. Bellaar-Spruyt (1842&ndash;1901), who gave
as example:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If you deny that Alexander was a great man, well, then you have to
acknowledge that he was not a great man. Both opposite judgements, A.
was a great man and A. was not a great man, cannot both be false.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Strictly speaking, Brouwer there considers not correctness and
absurdity of propositions as such but of properties of a mathematical
system; later (1949C: 1245; 1981A: 12), he gives the argument directly
in terms of what he there calls &ldquo;assertions&rdquo;. But for
example Wavre (1926) already adopted this direct reading, as did
Heyting (1930C).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Brouwer&rsquo;s actual theorem is about spreads, which are
constructed from trees over natural numbers and in certain cases
reduce to them. Also, a condition not mentioned by Brouwer is that the
bar be decidable. This condition is implicitly fulfilled in the
context in which the proofs of 1924 and 1927 are presented, because
there the bar is defined by application of the weak continuity
principle for choice sequences. This is not the case in the
presentation of 1954, which is defective. See Kleene and Vesley 1965:
87&ndash;88, and Brouwer 1981A: 102.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 Veldman (1982) has shown that for the continuity (as distinct from
the uniform continuity) of these functions, the bar theorem is not
needed. Continuity of course suffices for Brouwer&rsquo;s strong
counterexample.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 Dummett (2000: 32) emphasizes that the conviction that there will
always be open problems does not suffice to turn weak counterexamples
constructed by the oscillatory number technique into strong ones. For
that conviction is, he says, itself not a theorem or even a
mathematical proposition.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>,
 the infinite form \(\forall x\in \mathbf{R}(P(x) \vee \neg P(x))\) is
contradictory for certain <em class="m">P</em>; but that is, as
Brouwer remarks, not relevant to the project of devising finitary
consistency proofs (Brouwer 1928A2: 378 [Mancosu 1998: 43]).</p>

 In a historical account that would emphasize the influence of ideas
rather than their development, someone who would be given more
attention to than is done here is Rolin Wavre (Hesseling 2003; Mancosu
1998). In the West, a prelude to systematical work on the
formalization of intuitionistic logic was his paper &ldquo;Logique
formelle et logique empiriste&rdquo; (Wavre 1926). Besides discussing
differences between the classical and intuitionistic conceptions of
logic, it gives a list of some propositional principles that are
intuitionistically valid, as well as a list of some propositional
principles that are classically valid but not intuitionistically. In
this sense, it may be seen as an expanded version of Brouwer 1908C,
which the otherwise well-informed Wavre however does not seem to have
known. (Although the paper does not contain references, these are
included in Wavre&rsquo;s earlier paper of 1924, to which he refers in
footnote 1. The &ldquo;Bibliographie&rdquo; there mentions a number of
papers that appeared between 1901 and 1924 by Brouwer (including his
dissertation in Dutch), Weyl, Hilbert, and Bernays.) Wavre&rsquo;s
1926 paper, which was mainly expository and general in character, in
effect served more to emphasize to a philosophical audience the
urgency of systematic comparison than to develop one. Indeed, it
sparked the Barzin-Errera episode (Hesseling 2003; Mancosu 1998). But
it stopped short of presenting formalizations of either intuitionistic
or classical logic. Kolmogorov published his formalization before
Wavre&rsquo;s paper, and Heyting&rsquo;s paper from 1930 doesn&rsquo;t
mention it. Heyting surely knew Wavre&rsquo;s 1924 paper, which he
cites in his dissertation (Heyting 1925: 93); the 1926 paper was
published in the same journal. There may well have been an indirect
influence from Wavre on Heyting if the article played a role when
Mannoury wrote his proposal for the 1927 prize question that would be
successfully answered by Heyting; but that is only speculation.</p>

 The letter to Brouwer that Bernays mentions here seems to be lost:
neither in the Brouwer Archive in Utrecht (now at the Noord-Hollands
Archief, Haarlem), nor in the Bernays papers at the ETH in Z&uuml;rich
the letter, a draft, or a carbon copy is to be found. I am thankful to
Dirk van Dalen and Eckhart Menzler-Trott for verifying this for
me.</p>

 By tradition, the contest was anonymous, and a motto was required to
identify the winner. Heyting&rsquo;s motto is from the Bible, see
Matthew 7:9 and (in many but not all translations) Luke 11:11.</p>

 The members of the jury were, besides Mannoury, F. Schuh (professor
of mathematics and mechanics in Delft) and J. Wolff (professor of
mathematics at Utrecht university); like Brouwer, they had been
students of Korteweg, and they had defended their theses around the
same time as Brouwer, in 1905 and 1907, respectively.</p>

 1897&ndash;1940; his PhD adviser at Moscow State University was
Lusin, who had worked on effective set theory, and who there had also
advised Alexandrov and Urysohn (topologists who had become close
friends of Brouwer&rsquo;s), Khinchin (who had organized a seminar on
intuitionism in Moscow in 1926), and Kolmogorov (who had published on
intuitionistic logic in 1925). In such an environment, it is not
surprising that Glivenko became acquainted with and interested in
Brouwer&rsquo;s intuitionism.</p>

 In the 1950s, the formalization of intuitionistic analysis was taken
up again by Kleene, which led to the influential monograph Kleene and
Vesley 1965; his system was not inspired by Heyting&rsquo;s, see
Kleene 1973. Later attempts are Myhill 1966 and Vesley 1980.</p>

 As G&ouml;ran Sundholm emphasized in conversation, the
&ldquo;relative completeness&rdquo; that Heyting mentions, i.e., the
richness of the presentation of logic in <em>Principia
Mathematica</em>, must have been his reason for not taking Hilbert
1923 as his point of departure.</p>

 In his letter, Becker does not give the exact date. The

been preserved, is kept with the Heyting papers at the Noord-Hollands

 In a letter to Heyting of May 16, 1933, G&ouml;del says he had found
the translation in June 1932 (G&ouml;del 2003a: 71). In an earlier
letter to Heyting, dated November 15, 1932 and concerning their
projected joint book, G&ouml;del asked Heyting to</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
say something about the relation of Hilbert&rsquo;s finitism (as he
advocated it in his earlier works) and intuitionism. The former might
perhaps recognize even fewer inference rules and concept formations
than the latter. (G&ouml;del 2003a: 63)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Note that G&ouml;del did not take this earlier opportunity to announce
his translation to Heyting.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-32">

<p>

 <a href="heyting-logic.html#ref-32">32.</a>
 A translation of intuitionistic propositional logic into a modal
logic (anticipating \(\mathbf{S4})\) had been given before G&ouml;del,
and before the earlier (failed) attempt Becker 1930 (cited by
G&ouml;del), by the Russian logician I.E. Orlov. See Do&scaron;en 1992
and Bazhanov 2003. It seems that G&ouml;del and Becker were unaware of
this precursor.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-33">

<p>

 <a href="heyting-logic.html#ref-33">33.</a>
 One has the impression that G&ouml;del (1933f: 39n.1 [1986: 301n.1])
misses this point when he comments</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Kolmogorov (1932) has given a somewhat different interpretation of the
intuitionistic propositional calculus, without, to be sure, specifying
a precise formalism.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-34">

<p>

 <a href="heyting-logic.html#ref-34">34.</a>
 Examples of interpretations of intuitionistic predicate logic in
intuitionistically acceptable systems are Veldman 1976 and de Swart
1976, 1977. Veldman (1976: 159) is explicit that his construction does
not clarify the concept &ldquo;intuitionistically true sentence&rdquo;
but is a technical device.</p>

 As Heyting recalls in his letter of November 5, 1935 (page 3), they
had in fact met, briefly, in Z&uuml;rich in 1932; see also
Johansson&rsquo;s letter of November 15, 1935 (page 3). The latter
letter is also informative about Johansson&rsquo;s intellectual
background. The Heyting-Johansson correspondence as kept in
Heyting&rsquo;s archive ends with a postcard from Johansson of January
28, 1936. The Heyting papers are at the Noord-Hollands Archief,
Haarlem.</p>

 &ldquo;Appropriate&rdquo; here translates the Dutch
&ldquo;<em>doelmatig</em>&rdquo;. Other translations of that term are
&ldquo;suitable&rdquo;, &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;,
&ldquo;practical&rdquo; (<em>Groot Woordenboek Nederlands-Engels</em>,
Utrecht: van Dale 2008). The latter two may suggest a pragmatic
criterion. But that can hardly be what Heyting had in mind, given that
he thought of logical theorems as highly general mathematical ones,
and thus, intuitionistically, certain.</p>

 The term &ldquo;<em>Katalogisierung</em>&rdquo; in this context is
sometimes translated as &ldquo;cataloguing&rdquo; and more often as
&ldquo;locating&rdquo;; the former seems to fit better here.
Freudenthal&rsquo;s definition is in fact proposed as an alternative
to one that Brouwer made in a topological context (Brouwer 1926B2:
855). Freudenthal (1937a: 110) proves that the two definitions are
equivalent.</p>

 A technical mistake in Heyting&rsquo;s manuscript had been corrected
by Brouwer. See van Dalen 2011: 393 for the letter, and also the
extract and related remarks in Brouwer 1942A.</p>

 Also in later publications, e.g.,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If mathematics consists of mental constructions, then every
mathematical theorem is the expression of a result of a successful
construction. The proof of the theorem consists in this construction
itself, and the steps of the proof are the same as the steps of the
mathematical construction. (Heyting 1958C: 107)</p>

 In 1947 Paulette Destouches-F&eacute;vrier proposed a middle position
between Griss&rsquo; logic, which she found too extreme, and that of
Brouwer and Heyting by adding to the former the definition of \(\neg
p\) as \(p \rightarrow(1=2)\), but no axioms for it
(Destouches-F&eacute;vrier 1947b: 1243). However, she does not
motivate this philosophically. Destouches-F&eacute;vrier
(1914&ndash;2013) published (among many other things) a number of
short technical notes on intuitionistic logic, Griss&rsquo; logic, and
Johansson&rsquo;s logic (1945a,b, 1947a,b, 1948, 1949, 1951). She was
also the French translator of Heyting&rsquo;s manuscript for Heyting
1955.</p>

 Brouwer presented Griss 1944, 1946, 1950, 1951a, and 1951b; Heyting
presented Griss 1951c and 1951d, which dealt with intuitionistic
axiomatic geometry.</p>

 Brouwer himself has published mathematical papers that he, without
mentioning it at the time, did not sanction philosophically, namely,
his papers in classical topology from the period 1909&ndash;1913, in
which he used the classical reasoning that philosophically he had
already rejected in Brouwer 1908C. Looking back on that period,
Brouwer once called those papers &ldquo;free of philosophy&rdquo;
(<em>philosophiefrei</em>; Brouwer 1919D: 204).</p>

 Heyting (1958C: 111) remarks that &ldquo;from the intuitionistic
point of view this restriction is difficult to account for&rdquo;, and
seems to overlook that Van Dantzig addresses the classical
mathematician (van Dantzig 1947b: 1092).</p>

 Another development by Van Dantzig was &lsquo;stable
mathematics&rsquo; (1947a, 1951), an ecumenical attempt, inspired by
G&ouml;del&rsquo;s double negation translation of classical into
intuitionistic arithmetic (see
 <a href="index-2.html#SomeEarlResu">section 4.5.1</a>),
 to develop a fragment of classical mathematics in which all theorems
are equivalent to their double negations also by intuitionistic
standards. Gilmore (1956) pointed out in his review of van Dantzig
1951 that the greater problem for that project is not the occurrence
in classical mathematics of the principle of the excluded middle but
of impredicative definitions (see on this point also G&ouml;del *1933o
and *1941).</p>

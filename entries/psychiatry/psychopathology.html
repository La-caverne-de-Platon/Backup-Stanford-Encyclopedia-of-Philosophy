<h2>Philosophical Psychopathology</h2>

<h3><a name="VarPhiPsy">1. Varieties of Philosophical Psychopathology</a></h3>

<p>

The work surveyed so far in this entry mostly counts as philosophy
of science, where psychiatry is the science in question, and the
philosophy is concerned with topics familiar to philosophers of
science, such as explanation. Another tradition in philosophy of
psychiatry belongs to what Graham and Stephens (1994, 6) call applied
philosophy of mind, which is one of the approaches they distinguish in
their rough taxonomy of approaches to philosophical psychopathology.
The remaining category or work Graham and Stephens recognises looks at
the ethical and experiential aspects of mental disorder. This section
surveys some recent work in applied philosophy of mind. It does not aim
to be comprehensive, since this area has probably seen the most intense
flowering of recent philosophical work. We will look at some
representative work to get a sense of the varieties of topics and
projects under philosophical discussion.</p>

<p>

Philosophers writing in this vein (exemplified by Graham, 2010) look
to incorporate empirical results into philosophical reflection on
topics like personal identity, rationality or voluntary action. They
may also seek distinctively philosophical explanations of
psychopathologies, which try to understand them in terms borrowed from
the philosophy of mind. Whereas Murphy (2006), for example, sees the
scope of the mental as defined by the sciences of the mind, Graham
thinks of the mental as possessing the twin hallmarks of intentionality
and consciousness. Disturbances of intentionality and consciousness are
what count as mental illnesses, therefore, and philosophical theories
that treat of intentional or conscious states can help us to understand
mental disorders better.</p>

<p>

This philosophical project involves, but is not limited to,
conceptual clarification. Philosophers have made useful contributions
by interrogating the details of psychiatric concepts. This way of doing
philosophical psychopathology is exemplified by Part One of Potter
(2009). She looks at key concepts in the current understanding of
Borderline Personality Disorder, which is characterized by feelings of
emptiness or loss of self, impulsive or self-destructive behaviour,
bursts of anger and unstable relationships. A staple of the literature
on the condition is the idea that borderline patients are manipulative.
Potter (ch.6) usefully asks what this means. A therapist may often feel
outmanoeuvred by a patient who has managed to bring about an outcome
that the therapist did not prefer&mdash;for instance, a patient who
still wishes to be admitted to hospital despite her therapist's
judgement to the contrary may deliberately injure herself to force the
hospital to admit her. In this case, the patient has certainly
taken extreme measures to get her way, but it is not clear that it
counts as manipulation. The patient has defied medical opinion, but she
has not changed the therapist's mind or been deceptive&mdash;we
might prefer to think of manipulation as deliberately changing someone
else's mind through charm, trickery or some other psychological
process. That kind of ability to get your own way is often ascribed to
psychopaths, but in her work Potter makes us wonder if the same idea
really applies to borderline patients. Perhaps they should just be seen
as desperate people who are trying to cope with their distress, or
socially inept (115&ndash;16) rather than agents setting out to bend others
to their will. And even if they are trying to get their own way,
well, why shouldn't they? The concern Potter raises is that the
concept of manipulativeness is being used by clinicians to just mean
something like &lsquo;behaviour that makes my job harder&rsquo;.</p>

<h3><a name="ThoIns">2. Thought Insertion</a></h3>

<p>

The program set out by Graham and similar theorists has a different
agenda that goes beyond conceptual clarification. It involves both
using concepts from psychiatry to shed light on philosophical problems
and using existing philosophical positions to explain, or at least make
clearer, some of the issues that daunt psychiatrists. Take, for
example, delusions of thought insertion. Subjects with this condition
say that they have thoughts inside their minds that have been put their
by someone else or are actually being thought by someone else, as in
the following famous case reported by Mellor (1970): &ldquo;I look out
the window and I think that the garden looks nice and the grass looks
cool, but the thoughts of Eamonn Andrews come into my mind. There are
no other thoughts there, only his &hellip; He treats my mind like
a screen and flashes thoughts onto it like you flash a picture.&rdquo;
(Eamonn Andrews was a British TV personality.)</p>

<p>

It is very hard to imagine what thought insertion could be like: how
can I be introspectively aware of something as an episode in my mind,
yet at the same time experience it as someone else's thought?
Graham and Stephens (2000) suggest that thought insertion should be
seen as alienated self-consciousness. They draw on
Frankfurt's (1988, 59) idea that only some of things I do
actually express my agency. Some bodily movements can be movements of
my limbs without counting as actions of mine&mdash;perhaps because
someone else is controlling my movements. The same can be true of
mental events. If a tune runs through my mind unbidden, it is an
episode in my mental history. But it does not count as my mental
activity in the same way as the mental arithmetic I do to balance my
checkbook counts as mine. The latter, but not the former, comprises
intentional thought that expresses my agency. Graham and Stephens
(2000, 152) call these properties of thought the sense of
subjectivity and the sense of agency. They propose that the two
properties can come apart, so that in thought disorder the sense of
subjectivity occurs without the sense of agency. On this picture,
attributing the thought to someone else makes sense, because it is the
kind of mental activity that must be produced by something, carrying as
it does the hallmarks of agency (just not <em>my</em> agency).</p>

<p>

Such a theory does not explain where the abnormal experiences come
from. Rather, it tries to use philosophical resources to make the
experience somewhat less unfathomable, and perhaps clear some ground
for an explanation by pointing the way towards the sort of mental
processes that would need to be involved. A different approach to
philosophical psychopathology looks to the science to illuminate a
philosophical debate.</p>

<h3><a name="PsyMorPsy">3. Psychopaths and Moral Psychology</a></h3>

<p>

The debate over psychopathy seems to be a case where empirical
findings have a clear philosophical contribution to make. Findings
about psychopathy have been appealed to in two debates. First,
they are involved in the debate over whether moral judgments are
intrinsically motivating, or whether it is possible to know what
morality requires yet remain unmoved. Jesse Prinz (2007, 42) has
called psychopathy a &ldquo;test case&rdquo;, which helps us to
discriminate between the claim that moral judgments are intrinsically
motivating and the contrary claim that you could form a moral judgment
without being motivated to act on it. A second,
albeit related issue in moral psychology is the extent to which moral
judgments are the product of reason or of affective sentiments.</p>

<p>

Hume (1751, section IX) imagined the &ldquo;sensible knave&rdquo;,
who, &ldquo;in particular incidents, may think, that an act of iniquity
or infidelity will make a considerable addition to his fortune, without
causing any considerable breach in the social union and
confederacy. That <em>honesty is the best policy</em>, may be a
good general rule; but is liable to many exceptions: And he, it may,
perhaps, be thought, conducts himself with most wisdom, who observes
the general rule, and takes advantage of all the exceptions.&rdquo;
Hume's sensible knave knows what virtue requires but does not
care, because he lacks the sentiment of benevolence that normally
counteracts self interest. The sensible knave cannot be argued into
morality but not because of any intellectual deficiency; he just does
not feel the pull of morality at all. Shaun Nichols (2004) has argued
that psychopaths are actual cases of sensible knavery, since they
seem to fit Hume's criteria.</p>

<p>

According to Nichols (2004), psychopaths are sensible
knaves&mdash;amoral but fully rational agents. They lack prosocial
emotions (especially empathy), and this lack leads them to disregard
the claims of morality because they do not respond normally to the
sufferings of others. Nichols argues that because the moral flaws of
psychopaths are traceable to their emotional deficits, rather than any
shortcomings of reason, psychopaths refute what he calls
&ldquo;empirical rationalism&rdquo;. Empirical rationalism is the idea
that ethics is based on, or is just a province of, practical
reason. Our moral judgments are explicable in terms of the same
rational standards that apply to ordinary thought and action. Simply
put, being moral is just indistinguishable from being rational. If
psychopaths refute this view, thinks Nichols, they count as evidence
in favour of a broadly Humean approach to morality</p>

<p>

Nichols distinguishes empirical rationalism from moral rationalism.
Empirical rationalism claims that it is an empirical fact that moral
judgment in humans is a kind of rational judgment; i.e. our moral
judgments derive from our rational faculties or capacities. Conceptual
Rationalism states that it is a conceptual truth that people who make
moral judgments are motivated by them. That is, if you understand what
morality requires you will want to do it (because it is the rational
thing to do). Nichols concentrates on the empirical case&mdash;the
extent to which moral psychology is a form of practical reason.
</p>

<p>

Heidi Maibom (2005) has challenged Nichols' treatment on several
grounds. Most directly, Maibom points to literature showing that
psychopaths do in fact suffer from rational impairments. Psychopaths
seem to have trouble learning from experience, lack a grasp of
means-end reasoning, and lack an ability to plan for the longer term or
formulate and pursue longer-term goals. Maibom argues that
because of these deficits psychopaths fail to meet the rational
constraints on practical reason, such as coherence and consistency.
Maibom also argues that to support a Humean position, it is not
enough to tie these blemishes in the reasoning of psychopaths to
ultimate abnormalities in their emotional lives. For a Humean,
she argues, emotional deficits should have a direct effect on morality
via an absence of empathy, not an indirect one via reasoning failures
caused by a general lack of emotions.</p>

<p>

It does seem to be correct that psychopaths suffer from various
rational deficits. But nobody is perfectly rational, and the case has
to be made that psychopaths are different enough from normal subjects.
For Maibom to make her case, the rational shortcomings of psychopaths
need to make them a different class of subject, since Nichols'
argument depends on their being as rational as the average subject. We
remain unsure about the nature of the rational deficits in psychopathy,
but also about the significance of the various models of psychopathic
irrationality. Perhaps it is wrong to think of practical reason as a
unitary phenomenon or faculty. Psychopaths seem to be perfectly normal
when it comes to theory of mind and general intelligence, so maybe
their reasoning deficits are circumscribed in ways that leave them
rationally in the same class as normal subjects when it comes to the
reasoning systems that matter for morality. It may be in
the end that psychopathy involves a combination of emotional and
rational shortcomings that reflect a failure of normal
neuropsychological development. If that were the case, then they would
be less suitable to adjudicate between Humean approaches and Kantian
approaches that see morality in terms of practical reason, rather than
emotional responses.</p>

<p>

Controversy also exists over the extent to which psychopaths really
understand moral concepts, which they would have to do in order to
count as amoralists, rather than as people who do not understand
morality. Although psychopaths can employ moral language and use
emotion terms, some theorists (e.g. Hare 1993, ch 3) have argued that
they seem incapable of attaching the same sense as the rest of us to
the moral concepts they use. This may suggest that they do not really
grasp moral concepts. However, it may still be that their failure to
grasp moral concepts is due to their emotional stuntedness rather than
some deficit in reasoning (Prinz 2007, 46&ndash;47).</p>

<h3><a name="MulPer">4 Multiple Personality</a></h3>

<p>

Philosophers have also sought scientific support for their theories
by appealing to Multiple Personality Disorder, or Dissociative Identity
Disorder as it was called in DSM-IV. This has been a very controversial
diagnosis. Some philosophers have thought that it shows something very
interesting about the development of the self in normal subjects. Other
theorist have been more sceptical, both about the philosophical claims
and about the very reality of the condition itself.</p>

<p>

The basic picture of MPD/DID is that a sufferer has several distinct
personality states, known as &ldquo;alters&rdquo;. At various times,
one of the alters is in charge of the subject's behaviour. Each
alter has a peculiar, enduring pattern of perceiving, thinking about
and relating to the environment and self, as well as different patterns
of speech and physical comportment. The &ldquo;alters&rdquo; emerge spontaneously
and involuntarily to control behaviour, and function more or less
independently of each other. Not all alters are known to the patient.
This results in significant amnesia (not ordinary forgetting) on the
patient's part for those periods of time when an alter was in
control.</p>

<p>

Scepticism about MPD in the clinical community was fostered by the
circumstances under which it became prominent in the 1970s and 1980s.
The existence of dissociation is not controversial. DSM-IV (477)
defines it as &ldquo;disruption in the usually integrated functions of
consciousness, memory, identity or perception of the environment. The
disturbance may be sudden or gradual, transient or chronic&rdquo;.
Dissociation does not have to be pathological: it can occur in normal
life when, for example, one becomes absorbed in a task to the exclusion
of other aspects of the environment. And the idea of an alter
personality assuming control of behaviour emerged in the nineteenth
century. But the sceptics point out that fewer than a dozen cases had
been reported before the early 1970s, when a sudden epidemic flowered
up in North America, featuring subjects who had several, sometimes
dozens, of alters. Proponents of the diagnosis pointed to greater
awareness of child abuse as the key factor that made widespread
diagnosis possible, since it took great efforts to overcome public
reticence on that key causal factor.</p>

<p>

By the mid-nineties, the epidemic was waning, as more and more
psychiatrists began to conclude that the symptoms of MPD/DID were being
produced in the clinic by hypnosis and suggestion, in concert with
portrayals of the condition in the media. Questions were also raised in
retrospect about the validity of the diagnosis in some of the key cases
that inspired the great take-off in the diagnosis (McNally, forthcoming
ch 5). But there is no doubting the reality of the symptoms that are
displayed by people who receive the diagnosis. A tendency has been to
ask whether multiple personality is a real disorder or the product of
social circumstances, a culturally permissible way to express distress?
We should reject the presupposition that there is an important
contrast between being a real disorder and being a product of social
circumstances. The fact that a certain suite of mental symptoms appear
together only in specific historical or geographical contexts does not
imply that it is not real (See Hacking 1998 on transient mental
disorders). Philosophical discussion of dissociation is not
imperilled if the sceptics about MPD carry the day. However,
philosophical theories which are tied strongly to the more
controversial claims about the nature and etiology of MPD do look less
plausible.</p>

<p>

Dennett and Humphrey draw on MPD/DID to support a philosophical
proposal about the nature of the self. They do seem to tie their
interpretation of MPD/DID to the specifics of the causal story, since
they treat the condition as evidence for a particular theory about the
development of the self in normal cases. Different alters, as they put
it, express exaggerated moods but retain memories of their periods of
control that host personalities lack. These memories become aggregated
into a distinct self (or self-representation). The causal story they
favour (49&ndash;51) is borrowed from the MPD community, and asserts that
children endure abuse by dissociating and leaving an alter behind to
deal with the abuse. Then the alter splits into pieces that express
different emotional relations to what is going on (including
conflicting feelings towards the parent who is also the abuser).</p>

<p>

Are these alters different selves? Dennett and Humphrey distinguish
two theories of the self.</p>

<ol>

<li>The &ldquo;Proper Self&rdquo;: a ghostly supervisor who lives
inside the head. The seat of thought and consciousness.</li>

<li>The &ldquo;Fictive Self&rdquo;: a &ldquo;center of narrative
gravity&rdquo; of a biography, but with no real causal power. This is a
representation of what you are like that does not correspond to
anything inside the head.</li>
</ol>

<p>

Dennett and Humphrey dislike the &ldquo;proper Self&rdquo; idea
because they think that it is untrue to the way the human mind is
organized. They argue that the mind is a collection of unintelligent
subcomponents, with no overall executive control center. Like a
termite colony, a human being is made up of a set of independent
systems: different functional units responsible for (e.g.) vision,
language processing, theory of mind, working memory, emotional
appraisal, spatial cognition and so on. All these simple systems give
rise to intelligent behaviour. But unlike a termite colony, a human
being has a figurehead: each of us &ldquo;first
creates&mdash;unconsciously&mdash;one or more ideal fictive selves and
then elects the best supported of these into office as her head of
mind&rdquo; (1998, 41)</p>

<p>

On this view, normal development of the self is a matter of finding
the representation that makes the most sense. The representation that
makes the most sense does not have to be accurate. It reflects a desire
for coherence (and a role in social relations) rather than accuracy. In
MPD, Dennett and Humphrey argue that this process fragments into lots
of competing systems, since there are too many inconsistent pictures of
the &ldquo;real you&rdquo;: so the alters persist as different
representations that make partial sense of different aspects of the
self. The normal integration of different representations into a
coherent one is prevented by the strains of development.</p>

<p>

Owen Flanagan (1994) has developed a version of this view that is
slightly different. He argues that the self is a narrative: an
unfolding rationale for what in fact happens to you. Normally we assume
that there is one self per person, and that the self permits continuity
across change as we develop. But in the normal case, Flanagan thinks,
the self is multiplex&mdash;it permits some differentiation across
situations. The notion of a complete, well-integrated personality is a
normative concept&mdash;a way we think people ought to be&mdash;rather
than anything that is usual in psychology. It is a goal we work towards
that can be achieved in different ways.</p>

<p>

These views treat MPD as evidence for a particular theory of how the
self comes into being via developmental work at integrating different
aspects of the person. Ian Hacking (1995a, chs 16&ndash;18), on the other
hand, is sceptical of any claims that MPD/DID is evidence for positions
in the philosophy of mind. It may illustrate positions&mdash;if you
believe Dennett and Humphrey's theory of the self then you can
see how their view makes sense of the phenomenon of MPD/DID. But the
philosophical theory has to be confirmed elsewhere. This is partly
because the understanding of the syndrome the theory rests on is so
recent: Hacking argues that people &ldquo;have been diagnosed with
double consciousness or multiple personality for two centuries
`now. But they began to talk the way they do now&mdash;using the
symptom language described by Dennett&mdash;only very recently. Today
they all say such things, or at least suspect that they ought to say
them. That is how they learn to describe themselves in therapy&rdquo;
(226). Dissociation may be a genuine psychological condition, but the
details of dissociative identity disturbances are too contentious to
bear much philosophical weight. Hacking doubts that there is any stable
condition to have knowledge about, because the very act of being
classified alters human behaviour via what he calls the &ldquo;looping
effect&rdquo; (1995b, 2007. For discussion, see Cooper 2004, Murphy
2001, 2006 (ch 7), Tsou 2007). The looping effect comes about when
individuals change their behaviour in response to classification. Such
a feedback loop could, in principle, keep behaviour stable, but Hacking
is interested in those cases in which the behaviour is rendered
unstable. He has also (1998) examined the case of transient mental
illnesses, which appear to flare up and then go out of existence.</p>

<h3><a name="Del">5. Delusions</a></h3>

<p>

Of all psychiatric concepts, it is probably delusions that have
received the most extensive recent treatment from philosophers. Here
the issues straddle philosophy of mind and philosophy of science. Some
theorists have raised conceptual difficulties for accounts of
delusions, others have sought to frame scientific hypotheses that can
explain delusions in terms of information-processing deficits or other
subpersonal problems. And some philosophers have looked for a
distinctively philosophical explanation of delusions, which draws on
concepts previously formulated in the philosophy of mind.</p>

<p>

Like many other psychological concepts, the concept of delusion has
a fairly explicit and self-conscious scientific use and a variety of
commonsense uses. There is considerable overlap between some
psychiatric uses and some casual employments of &ldquo;delusion&rdquo;.
But there are clearly everyday occasions when &ldquo;delusion&rdquo;
merely refers to a belief that seems obviously false or unwarranted to
the speaker. I might call you delusional when you announce that you
expect to buy a four bedroom house in your neighbourhood for what you
can afford to pay, without meaning that your reasoning is symptomatic
of a psychotic illness; it is just wishful thinking. But delusions in a
technical sense are manifestations of psychosis. DSM-5 (819)
defines a delusion as &lsquo;A false belief based on incorrect
inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what
almost everyone else believes and despite what constitutes
incontrovertible and obvious proof or evidence to the contrary
&hellip;.&rsquo;. Furthermore, the delusion must be inexplicable in
cultural terms, so that religious beliefs are not counted as
delusional, no matter how bizarre. The fact that the patient belongs to
a culture or community in which the relevant belief is treated as a
religious claim means that it does not count as a delusion. This
proviso has seemed odd to many people. It may just testify to the
disinclination of psychiatrists to take sides in religious disputes,
but perhaps the best way to view it is as an acknowledgment of the
importance of testimony or social context in the normal acquisition of
our beliefs. We expect people to acquire religious, or otherwise
culturally specific, beliefs that might strike outsiders to the culture
as odd. But the weirdness of the belief does not impugn the normality
of the process of culturally specific belief transmission, so the
products of such cultural transmission should not be treated as
pathological, no matter how strange we may think they are.</p>

<p>

Other aspects of the definition of delusion have also come under
attack. Gipps and Fulford 2004 ably summarize some standard objections.
These include the idea that a delusion has to be false. Jaspers (1997,
106), for instance, argues that someone who is pathologically jealous
and suffers from delusional beliefs about their partner's
infidelity (&ldquo;the Othello Syndrome&rdquo;) might in fact be
correct. The partner could actually be unfaithful. In this case the
truthfulness of the belief is beside the point, since we can recognise
pathological jealousy without regard to truth. Ryan (2009, 24) notes
that someone with Ekbom's syndrome (the belief that one is
infested with bugs) might coincidentally suffer scabies. Fulford (1989,
204&ndash;5) also mentions a patient whose only symptom of psychopathology
was the delusion that he was mentally ill&mdash;if he really was
mentally ill, then that couldn't have been a delusion. On the
other hand, as Graham and Stephens (2007, 194) note, many theorists
have doubted that delusions are really beliefs at all. Delusions often
lack properties that beliefs have been thought to possess. In
particular, delusions often seem poorly integrated with the rest of the
subject's beliefs, and they can lack the affect associated with
firmly-held beliefs. These objections are rebutted by Bortolotti
(2009). The boundaries between delusion and other states, like
self-deception, have also been discussed (Bayne and Fernandez 2009. For
general philosophical accounts of delusion see Bortolotti 2009, Radden
2010.)</p>

<p>

Analyses of delusion can look like inversions of the attempts made
by analytic epistemologists to define knowledge. We may agree that a
delusion is a false belief, just as knowledge is true belief, but, as
with knowledge, we do not rest there. Knowledge is true belief plus
something that ties the true belief to the world in the right way. So
too, we try to find that extra property of the false belief that
converts it from a false belief into a delusion. This conceptual
program is seen as the prelude to the development of empirical theories
of delusion, in which philosophers work alongside cognitive scientists
(Davies and Coltheart 2000).</p>

<p>

These theories have tended to assume that when
&lsquo;delusion&rsquo; is used in the technical sense it denotes a
psychological natural kind (Samuels 2009) whose basic psychological
structure can be worked out via attention to paradigmatic cases. Call
this <em>the explanatory project</em>. We can distinguish two versions;
one involves explaining delusions as caused by failures of normal
relations among components of our cognitive architecture, or at least
those parts of it that have to do with the fixation of belief. Another
way of proceeding is more philosophical. It is less bothered with
causal theories of cognitive architecture and more concerned to find
resources in the philosophy of mind that characterise delusions in an
illuminating way.</p>

<p>

Neuropsychological theories of the origin of monothematic delusions
(Those characterised by one dominant delusional belief about one
specific matter) have come to fall into two camps: one factor and two
factor theories. According to one familiar version of the
two-factor theory (Davies and Coltheart 2000), an unusual experience is
the first factor in the aetiology of a delusion, but there must also be
a second factor. The first factor can be seen as an impairment that
effects the reception of information about the world. The delusion
belief explains that input&mdash;your spouse seems odd, so you
conclude that he has been replaced by a robot. That explains the
oddness, but in order for you to form that belief there has to be a
second impairment, in some system that forms or evaluates beliefs. This
will typically be some neurocognitive deficit that interacts with the
experience. The impairment in your reasoning system prevents you from
rejecting the explanatory belief, despite its lack of warrant. The
disagreement with one factor theories (Davies et al. 2005) turns on
whether the first deficit suffices to cause the delusion.</p>

<p>

The more purely philosophical approach to explaining delusions
concentrates on the role the delusion plays in the subject's
mental life, as understood in terms of some theories in philosophy of
mind. Arguably, these attempts at philosophical understanding of
delusions originate with Jaspers' (1997) concept of a
<em>primary</em> delusion, which is a subjectively meaningful
transformation in the patient's experience of the world. Recent
work in this tradition includes the <em>delusional stance</em> idea
of Graham and Stephens (2007). In a similar vein to their
explanation of thought disorder in terms of identifying with
one's own thoughts or being alienated from them, they suggest
(194) that delusions are constituted by a higher-order stance towards
lower- order intentional states. This stance involves an identification
with the lower order states, which become seen as an expression of
one's own agency or mental nature. As in Jaspers'
treatment, it is the role of the delusion in the subjective mental life
of the deluded person that is critical.</p>

<p>

These two approaches represent two ways of doing philosophical
psychopathology, as a foundational contribution to a scientific inquiry
or as a piece of philosophy of mind. They are not incompatible; the
philosophical projects may help us to better describe the phenomena
psychiatrists care about and make the explanatory project easier.
On the other hand a two-factor explanation, or some other
neuropsychological account, does not have to falsify a philosophical
description of delusions. It may be that philosophical accounts make
unwarranted empirical assumptions, but they may simply illuminate the
condition as it is experienced by those who suffer from it, or guide us
towards a philosophical account of the mind that is informed by real
cases rather than armchair ones. The last decade has seen a great
increase in work on the epistemology and philosophical significance of
psychiatry, which is becoming a recognisable philosophical field.
The full implications of this development, both intellectually
and professionally, are still a long way off.</p>

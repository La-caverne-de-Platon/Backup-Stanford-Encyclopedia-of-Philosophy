<h2>Political Economy: Theory, Practice, and Philosophical Consequences</h2>

<h3>Intellectual landscape</h3>

<p>
Neurath&rsquo;s economic theory intended to challenge Carl
Menger&rsquo;s Aristotelian, sometimes Platonist, essentialism,
Schmoller&rsquo;s inductivism, Weber&rsquo;s ideal-types value theory,
and B&ouml;hm-Bawerk and others&rsquo; expected and marginal utility
theory, based on maximization of utility. While remaining within the
tradition of the Austrian school of economic theory, in the technical
form of decision theory (and a corresponding model of rationality),
Neurath rejected the assumption of the value and even possibility of a
precise calculus of utility involving an abstract and universal unit
of calculation and uni-dimensionally commensurable alternatives. He
defended, instead, an irreducibly multi-factorial notion of welfare
over profit. </p>

<p>
Neurath shaped and changed his ideas through engagement in ongoing
debates dating from the late 19<sup>th</sup> century til the early
20<sup>th</sup> century: the socialism debate (centered around Marx),
the method debate (centered around Schmoller and Menger), the
value-judgment debate (centered around Weber and Sombart), the unity
of science -or natural vs. human sciences- debate (centered around
Rickert and Dilthey), the socialization debate (centered around
Kautsky, Adler, Bauer and Bernstein), and the socialist calculation
debate (centered around von Mises and Hayek).</p>

<h3>Historiography or philosophy of history</h3>

<p>
The debates over the historical sciences, a cornerstone of
19<sup>th</sup>-century German intellectual culture, were prompted by
Leopold von Ranke&rsquo;s rejection of Hegel&rsquo;s idealist
philosophy of history, with its universal and concept-driven laws of
development, to be replaced with an empiricist emphasis on
documentation of facts through original sources, and, unlike any
nomological, generalist, approach characteristic of the natural
sciences, an emphasis on the value of individual periods and cultures
and human agency. The idealist tradition was based on the notion that
knowledge requires conceptual representation and Fichte&rsquo;s
student Emile Lask would speak of the <em>hiatus irrationalis</em>
between reality itself and conceptual representation, and would note
that, from the latter&rsquo;s point of view, the former was infinitely
complex (Oakes 1991). The general cannot capture the individual.
Moreover, the interpretive role of the historian towards texts,
cultural artifacts, brought attention to their authors and human
agency more generally. </p>

<p>
From the same viewpoint, German historiography soon developed a
history sensitive to the plurality of relevant historical dimensions
of historical phenomena and their causes, with cultural history, and
the interest in collective and institutional entities, defended by
Lamprecht, Meyer, Weber and others (despite mutual criticisms).
Independently, from the idealist tradition and the philological and
literary movements, German historiography developed an explicit
interest in hermeneutics, emphasizing the role of understanding,
associated with B&ouml;ckh, Weber and Dilthey. Also influential on
Neurath on this account were Goethe and T&ouml;nnies, who believed in
the hold words and concepts had on experience, historical and
ordinary. </p>

<p>
Goethe&rsquo;s influence and Neurath&rsquo;s romantic inheritance are
manifest in two areas, morphology and historiography: holism,
historical conditioning, role of pictures and metaphorical language in
carrying physical theory and argument (ON 1973, 102-3), role of
language, and thereby hypothetical elements, in establishing facts
(Zemplen 2006). One may add that Neurath&rsquo;s views fit with the
romantic German tradition that emphasized will, life and holism,albeit
against pseudorationalism, without metaphysics. Also, in 1908, Neurath
appears listed as secretary of the <em>Wiener Goethe Verein</em> in
its journal <em>Chronik des Wiener Goethe-Vereins</em> XXII, 39. Also
Hans Hahn is listed as member.</p>

<p>
Neurath&rsquo;s early work on the history of economics placed him at
the center of debates over historiography and the human sciences. He
valued (1) empiricism without universal generalizations or laws of
development, as well as (2) the synthesis between the subjective and
objective aspects of interpreted materials without metaphysical
commitments about the mind, and (3) the interest, found in Meyer and
Schmoller, in the plurality of conditions and institutions that may
characterize a historical phenomenon or period. The clear apprehension
of different conditions and their relations effectively turn history
into a catalogue of combinations out of which (conditional) lessons
can be drawn. He would develop this idea in his notions of economic
theory and history of science in the form of combinatorial
generalizations of the number and kinds of arrangements of
possibilities. These would form the conceptual or logical matrix in
which to situate the subset of actual empirical historical cases
realized (see below).</p>

<p>
According to Sombart and Weber, the conceptual and interpretive
dimension of history raised the issue of its value-ladenness in
detriment of its scientific objectivity, particularly in the human
sciences, such as political economy. Sombart pointed to the case of
the notion of welfare. For Neurath, value judgments enter economic
theory in terms of measured subjective pleasure of economic agents; or
else in the evaluation of economic orders or plans relative to
desiderata under consideration. But in neither case a measure of moral
valuation is given by economic, or more generally, scientific theory.
Objectivity in science was possibly insofar as it limited itself to
description, even in causal terms, of relations to situations to be
preferred on external grounds (Neurath 1911).</p>

<p>
As a matter of methodology in political economy, Neurath&rsquo;s
interests and education placed him in the middle of the debate over
method that separated the German Historical School and the Austrian
school, the historical and theoretical approach. The Historical
School, whose most visible representative became Gustav Schmoller,
defended a historical scope largely for the purpose of applying
empirical statistical methods. It was associated with the <em>Verein
f&uuml;r Sozialpolitik</em> for the purpose of discussing and
providing objective empirical judgment to inform government policy and
guide social reform. Schmoller argued that the inductive empirical
methodology was more attuned to the complexity of social phenomena and
the empirical and academic status of the research and researchers
provided a level of neutrality that enhanced objectivity and
neutrality in the face of ideological and political conflict (Cat
1996, Lindenfeld 1997, Grimmer-Solem 2003). </p>

<p>
The Austrian School, often seen represented by Carl Menger, father of
the mathematician Karl Menger, favored a more purely theoretical
approach, with conceptual analysis and deductive methods. Neurath
defended a meta-methodological neutral stance that rejected the
methodological debate as a pseudo-problem and assumed the
compatibility and joint applicability of the two kinds of analyses:
&lsquo;Historical analyses often provided occasion for more general
considerations, while theoretical research promotes the comprehension
of organizational forms and induces historians to focus more closely
on certain details.&rsquo; (Neurath 1911) Subsequent methodological
debates between Neurath and Carnap within the Vienna Circle and
discussions of logical empiricism often seem to recapitulate some of
the traits of the <em>Methodenstreit</em> -with Neurath adopting a
synthesis of theory and history that is closer to Schmoller&rsquo;s
attitude under the contextualist rubric of history, in opposition to
Carnap&rsquo;s and Popper&rsquo;s projects under the rubric of theory
(Cat 1995, Cartwright et al. 1996).</p>

<h3>Neurath&rsquo;s economics</h3>

<p>
Neurath&rsquo;s contributions to scientific epistemology have their
roots in many of his views on economics. Neurath&rsquo;s historical
bend not only led him to the subject of his doctoral and postdoctoral
research in economy of antiquity&mdash;Cicero and Egypt; it also
shaped his pedagogical work and was reinforced by it, with an
economics textbook co-edited with his first wife, Anne Shapire, in the
form of an anthology of classical readings beginning with Plato and
Aristotle. It is from the cultures of antiquity that Neurath gets much
inspiration for his economic and social ideas: Egyptian economy in
kind and visual languages (hieroglyphs) and Aristotelian economics of
personal and social wealth. Neurath paid attention to the different
roles of money, in history and contemporary debates on monetary
economic (Uebel 2004, Mooslechner 2008).</p>

<p>
The Austrian School, especially with Menger and Schumpeter, had
developed a quantitative economic theory based on the notion of wealth
reduced to exchange value and hence with a focus on market behavior.
The ensuing theory was an a priori (hardly empirical psychology),
heuristic, model developing the utilitarian calculus of subjective
pleasure, the so-called <em>homo economicus</em> model of marginal
utility theory: with utility calculations based on precise unitary
measures&mdash;cardinal, not just ordinal measures- of utility value
and ordering of preferences&mdash;altogether a decision theory-, in
support of a price theory, in particular, a market equilibrium theory
(Tribe 1995 ch. 6, Blaug 1996 and 1997). Rational decision-making,
prediction and explanation relied ultimately on monetary calculations
based on observable, uniform quantitative units such as prices and a
focus on price signaling in market exchanges; losses provide
indicators of inefficiency. The assumptions behind the theory relied
on controversial and developing areas of empirical psychology, social
and political theory and scientific epistemology.By contrast, Marx and
energeticists advocated equally uniform and quantitative units of
labor. </p>

<p>
Neurath challenged crucial assumptions, opposing both money and labor
calculations (see Uebel 2004 and Turk 2018). In sum, the
representation and comparative evaluation of organized economic
totalities could not be reduced, according to Neurath, to uniform
units of measurement of elementary constituents. Qualitative
measurements of exact qualitative relations provide the only basis for
in-kind, natural calculations of value and overall happiness and
enable an administrative, unified, holistic model of socialized
economy (patterned after wartime command economies maximizing
efficiency in the availability and use of resources). The result was a
rather inchoate combination of socialism and ecological economics in
which the administrative economy is guided by egalitarian principles
of distribution in the pursuit of maximum social happiness. From
Aristotle and socialist literature Neurath adopted the household
economic notion of wealth based on use value and welfare. Economists,
he stressed from a consequentialist perspective, are interested in
finding out what the conditions of the wealth of people are and which
institutions increase it and which decrease it (Neurath 1917/2004,
328). The challenge remained to defend the rationality and
objectivity, the fairness of decision-making in the alternative
framework. As a personal matter as well as a matter of social justice,
economic and political theory required a representation of wealth and
its allocation. </p>

<p>
Tackling &lsquo;the problem of pleasure maximum&rsquo;, in the early
1910s, Neurath argued that cardinal measures for comparative utility,
or pleasure values, could not be determined for the same individual,
much less for different individuals (Neurath 1912/1973). The rejection
of cardinality as a framework for representing utility, and wealth,
resorted to considerations similar to ones introduced in empirical
psychology by Fechner quantitative psycho-physics and more recently
Duhem&rsquo;s conceptual discussion of physical measurement and
quantification via the use of scales (Fechner 1860 and Duhem 1906),
among them the importance in order to construct cardinal units -and
not just ordering relations- of fixing at least a zero point, and
establish one end of a scale. Neurath also rejected, independently,
the in-principle additivity of utility functions, that is, of
pleasures. Despite the exact relations modeled after inequalities and
additive operations in algebraic logic, social utility maxima cannot
be calculated univocally. Interpersonal comparisons (even for the same
individual over time) of utility are not generally available; and when
they are, then it is the unitary measures which are not. In
conclusion, cardinal unitary measures are not necessary for
comparability; and comparability is neither necessary nor sufficient
for choice, or, specifically, economic, social or political
decision-making, to achieve a desired state of welfare.</p>

<p>
Without a unitary measure, and an algorithmic calculation method for
decision-making, Neurath was articulating and urging a more general
type of framework: a shift from a model of <em>market economy</em> to
models of <em>administrative economy</em>
[<em>Verwaltungswirtschaft</em>] or <em>economy in kind</em>
[<em>Naturalwirtschaft</em>]. Market economy, in any of its varieties,
assumes a framework in which &lsquo;people influence each
other&rsquo;s actions exclusively by means of the higher and lower
qualities of life that result from the process of exchange&rsquo; with
the main conditioning factors of profit and loss, and the goals of
maximizing the first kind and minimizing the second. An administrative
economy can &lsquo;by rewards and penalties, prompt the individuals to
do things which they would not have done in an economy characterized
by exchange, because without these rewards and penalties the
consequences would have been different.&rsquo; (Neurath 1917/2004,
321).</p>

<p>
At national levels, the historical geopolitical circumstances of
Central Europe in the 1910s and a commission from the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace enabled Neurath to study war
economies as empirical realizations of administrative models (Neurath
1919/1973, 123-157). </p>

<p>
The <em>Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Year Book</em> for
1912, lists several Neurath projects to be completed in 1913 and 1914:
&lsquo;Austrian and Servian [sic] loans, 1908-09&rsquo;,
&lsquo;Rivalry among states with respect to capitalist investments in
foreign countries&mdash;Adriatic railway&rsquo;, &lsquo;circulation of
and revenue from private economic property&rsquo;, &lsquo;Effect of
war upon the supply of the world with food and raw material&rsquo;,
&lsquo;Stimulation or depression of nations by war (war and living
conditions)&rsquo;. &lsquo;Influence of annexation upon the economic
life of the annexing state and upon the state whose territory has been
annexed&rsquo;, &lsquo;annexation of half-civilized or uncivilized
peoples, etc.&rsquo;, &lsquo;Economic effects of withdrawing men from
industrial pursuits to enter the army and navy&rsquo;,
&lsquo;Compulsorily-Austrian labor market, 1866-78-1904&rsquo;,
&lsquo;Non-compulsorily-Austrian labor market, 1866-78-1904&rsquo;,
&lsquo;Loans for armaments&mdash;forms of loans&rsquo;, &lsquo;Effects
of war on economic conditions&rsquo; (C.E.I.P. Year Book for 1912,
93). Three works by Neurath associated with political economist Eugene
von Philippovich of the University of Vienna as economics and history
editor listed as indefinitely delayed by the war: &lsquo;The effects
of the Balkan wars on Austria-Hungary, with special regard to Serbia,
Bulgaria, Roumania, Russia, Montenegro, Albania, Italy, Switzerland
and Germany&rsquo;; &lsquo;War and order of life. The liquidity,
productivity and rentability of the wealth of nations in the case of
war&rsquo;; and (with Professor Harald Westergaard, professor of
political science and statistics at the University of Copenhagen as
editor) &lsquo;Preliminary statistical studies in Old Servia
[sic]&rsquo; (C.E.I.P.Year Book for 1915, 90). </p>

<p>
A war economy planned production and distribution to meet perceived
(and calculated) needs during wartime. An economy in kind similarly
planned for peacetime. Neurath found in war economies the displayed
advantages of speed of decision and execution, optimal distribution of
means relative to military goals, and increased evaluation and
utilization of invention. Two disadvantages resulting from centralized
decision-making might be the ineffective replacement of simple
exchanges and the reduction of productivity, which could be reduced,
as Lenin learned, through the methods of Taylorism (Tribe 1995, 155).
Social and economic theory, and scientific methodology, had become for
Neurath matters of theory and of actual practice, of the relation
between theory and practice, and, just as important,of a theory of
practice (Neurath 1913/1983).</p>

<p>
In opposition to the reductive notion of monetary wealth, Neurath
distinguished between the notion of <em>quality of
life</em>&mdash;with its degrees of intensity- and the <em>basis of
life</em>. The former is the complex of experiences collected under
the rubrics pleasure, happiness and welfare. The latter is the
complexes of conditions that cause the corresponding experience and he
called <em>conditions of life</em>, which could be better studied, and
were to be portrayed by a <em>life physiognomy</em>: &lsquo;what food
the individuals consume per year, what their housing conditions are,
what and how much they read, what their experiences are in family
life, how much they work, how often and how seriously they fall ill,
how much time they spend walking, attending religious services,
enjoying art, etc.&rsquo; (Neurath 1917/2004, 326). Calculation in
kind [<em>Naturalrechnung</em>] would involve a realistic
consideration of incommensurable qualitative possibilities, a
plurality of individuals, incomplete insight in the face of
complexity, and, no less important, the necessity to act. </p>

<p>
As a result, calculation in kind required a new form of practical
reasoning, one far from the astronomical, Laplacean ideal in science
and the Cartesian rationalist and individualistic ideal in philosophy,
&mdash; which he referred to as &ldquo;pseudorationality&rdquo; and he
subsequently recognized in Popper&rsquo;s views. The alternative mode
of calculation was based on (a) judgment (&lsquo;directly judge the
desirability&rsquo; of possibilities, Neurath 1919/1973, 146), (b)
justification (by showing &lsquo;that it fits into the whole pattern
of personal life of which we approve&rsquo;, Neurath 1928/1973, 249),
and (c) extra-logical factors or auxiliary motives. Tossing a coin is
just one example of such motives as causes of decisions and thereby of
actions (Neurath 1913/1983, 1917/2004); Neurath commended it over
choices made &lsquo;with the help of an inadequate metaphysical
theory&rsquo; (Neurath 1912/1973, 122). A similar role was played by
epistemic and social aims such as unity and coordination and economic
constraints such as the avoidance of crises of overproduction and
artificial scarcity (since Marx&rsquo;s <em>Capital</em> referred to
as the production anarchism, wastefulness, madness or chaos of the
market) (Neurath 1917/2004, 322, Cat 1995 and 2000). Neurath&rsquo;s
voluntarism and his arguments anticipated much contemporary
discussions of practical rationality under conditions of
incomparability and incommensurability (see, for instance, Chang 1997,
and O&rsquo;Neill 2002).</p>

<p>
Whereas an economy in kind requires calculation in kind, calculation
in kind did not imply economy in kind. Neurath&rsquo;s initial
arguments after World War I were intended to defend economy in kind as
a moneyless, marketless economy, where monetary calculations are
insufficient and calculations in kind are universal and necessary.
This implies the weaker claim against market fundamentalism, namely,
that the universality of monetary, or profit-based calculations are
the basis for rational decisions about labor and goods. In exile,
after the Nazi annexation of Austria, Neurath&rsquo;s arguments
shifted towards the weaker claim (Uebel 2008).</p>

<p>
The total dimension of the social and economic plan assumed plurality
of people&rsquo;s interests and their representation. Despite the
centralized structure of his planning models, Neurath consistently
defended, as least intended, his models as <em>democratic</em>: first
in the sense of <em>representation</em>, which from a
technical&mdash;scientific and empirical- viewpoint was expressed
through statistical surveys and informed citizen participation (hence
the relevance of empirical visual languages as vehicles of public
education at the service of democracy); second, in the sense of
<em>compromise</em> (&lsquo;cooperative compromise&rsquo;), namely,
non-additive, negotiated cooperation with the aim of achieving an
otherwise impossible state of welfare or order of life; third,
<em>freedom</em> to have a <em>multiplicity of loyalties</em> and
<em>tolerance</em> towards differences and multiplicity of attitudes
-even within one&rsquo;s own behavior, as &lsquo;a human being full of
contradiction&rsquo;, echoing his own rejection in 1913 of a Cartesian
logical unity as model for the psychological unity of the self
(Neurath 1942/1973, 429)- (on pluralism, see O&rsquo;Neill 1998 and
2008).</p>

<h3>Socialization debates: Political and theoretical developments</h3>

<p>
Besides the socialist tradition and debates, Austria had its own
tradition of scientific utopianism based on Mach&rsquo;s empiricist
interest in energy as fundamental notion and his technological
optimism. Leading figures were Josef Popper-Lynkeus and Carl Ballod
(known also under the pen-name Ballod-Atlanticus), who proposed plans
for the rational, fair and sustainable allocation of exhaustible
energy and materials, established through statistical empirical
methods to address the capitalist problems (crises) of production and
distribution at the root of much poverty, and realized through the
notions of a national peacetime work draft, a nutrition army, and the
nationalization of distribution (Popper-Lynkeus 1912, Ballod 1898).
</p>

<p>
The calculations involved statistical surveys and assessments of
nutrition and living conditions needs and work hours needed for
producing them. Energy and time units were fundamental; time units
were the standard cardinal unity of measurement in socialist
calculations. One of the classical problems was the so-called
imputation problem, of calculating the proportional contribution of
production goods in joint production. Marx solved the problem and the
parallel problem for consumer goods with the non-subjective labor
theory of value, in terms of units of measurement for the amount of
labor required for their production. The utopianist contributions went
beyond the Marxist model of evolution of capitalism into modeling
proposals of what are now categorized as <em>ecological economics</em>
(Martinez-Alier 1987, O&rsquo;Neill 1993 and 2002). </p>

<p>
From a technical point of view, scientific utopianism is an approach
to social engineering in terms of the exploration of possible
constructions for alternative social scenarios. Like mechanical
engineering, according to Neurath these utopian social constructions
(1) stem from imaginary and conceptual fictions and possibilities
(&lsquo;the great task of consciously cultivating the future and the
possible&rsquo;), (2) they involve notions of balance and conservation
in &lsquo;comprehensive administration of energy and power&rsquo;, (3)
a collective dimension in the role and value of collaboration, (4)
contextual and holistic social and historical aspects of thought,
language and conventions (&lsquo;it is not a single individual who can
really think new notions through to the end, but only whole groups or
generations. Thinking, too, is a collective occurrence. Thus the
Marxist must from the outset keep with a special vigour to historical
experience&rsquo; Neurath 1928/1973, 293), (5) a pragmatic dimension
in decision-making that connects planning with action and
transformation of reality (&lsquo;successful collaboration id possible
only when those who act fix on one possibility, whether by agreement
or by propaganda. This choice itself is a matter of action and
resolution, but that does not mean&rsquo;, insisted Neurath,
&lsquo;that such action has no scientific basis&rsquo; Neurath
1928/1973, 293) and (6) a holistic dimension, insofar as socialization
and planning are forms of &lsquo;total organizations&rsquo;, which
must engage the economy as a whole (and from above), (7) in a unified
format so that for any such model one may say that a &lsquo;unified
program would have coordinated and unified action&rsquo; (Neurath
1919/1973, 150-155, and Neurath 1920/1973, 19). </p>

<p>
History provided the opportunity as well as the insight for practice.
The end of World War I brought with it the collapse of the German
economy, the end of the rule of the Kaiser and his latest conservative
government. Caught in the tide of communist revolutionary changes that
was sweeping Eastern Europe, two short-lived Soviet republics were
declared. In November 1918, the office of the Chancellor was occupied
by Friedrich Ebert, a Majority Social Democrat, and under pressure
from the now powerful Workers and Soldiers Council movement the new
government established a commission to plan a comprehensive
socialization of the economy. At the same time, Bavaria and Saxony
declared a soviet republic, albeit in Bavaria presided by the
Independent Socialist Kurt Eisner. Neurath, crafted a socialization
plan for Saxony (the Kranold-Neurath-Schumann plan), and in January
1919 presented his ideas to the new Bavarian government and the Munich
workers (Neurath 1973, ch 1, 1-83, Neurath 1920/2004, 345-370, Cat et
al 1995, Uebel 2004). He was dismissed by the chairman of the
socialization commission and Munich professor of economics, Lujo
Brentano, as an &lsquo;ancient-Egyptian romantic economist&rsquo;
(which in a more interesting sense he was). But his ideas received the
support of the industrialist, chairman of AEG, Walther Rathenau. While
the assassination of Eisner led to the violent suppression of the
Bavarian soviet republic, in March Neurath was appointed president of
the central planning office for Bavaria. Carl Ballod was put in charge
of calculation in kind. Neurath requested that his position be
considered of a nonpolitical administrator as he considered his task
as a technical one, with scientific status and ideologically
neutrality. After a third, now communist, government&rsquo;s fall and
arrest, the same considerations at his trial kept him out of prison in
1921, although also out of Germany. He was forced to return to
Austria, where he joined the more socially oriented socialization
efforts (with a focus on housing, education, etc) led by the
Austro-Marxist Otto Bauer, among others, in what had become Red Vienna
(Cat et al. 1996).</p>

<p>
Neurath&rsquo;s technical model of natural, that is, non-monetary,
economics became after World War I a matter of socialist politics and
part of the literature on socialization. As a social scientist, his
main strategy for linking his work with the Marxist tradition was to
defend it alongside Marx&rsquo;s own work as scientific in character,
as examples of social science. A
meta-theoretical&mdash;epistemological, methodological- perspective
resulted from his own familiarity with a number of debates over
disciplinary issues in the human sciences, and philosophical issues
and positions regarding the natural sciences rooted in Mach&rsquo;s
empiricism and Poincar&eacute; and Duhem&rsquo;s conventionalism, with
their own critical, anti-metaphysical, naturalistic and pragmatist
connotations.</p>

<p>
Neurath&rsquo;s position sat uncomfortably among a number of economic
and political models attempting to develop Marxism, or socialism, as
an alternative to monetary market capitalism: Eduard Bernstein&rsquo;s
ethical revisionism and Karl Kautsky&rsquo;s Social Democratic
Marxist orthodoxy and agrarianism, Victor Adler, Max Adler and Otto
Bauer and others&rsquo; personalist, cultural and non-territorial
Austro-Marxism, Karl Korsch&rsquo;s workers council democracy,
Bolshevism&rsquo;s dictatorship of the proletariat or Rosa
Luxemburg&rsquo;s Spartacism, without parliamentary representation.
Unlike market socialists such as Helen Bauer, Neurath rejected the
role of money. Unlike orthodox Marxism, Neurath&rsquo;s central
planning rejected the reliance of units of measurement of work and the
objective content of price measurements. His humanist, welfarist,
voluntarist, scientific utopianism was an engineered epicurean
socialism (closer in spirit to young-Marx&rsquo;s philosophy) (Neurath
1928/1973, 284-90, Uebel 2004, Sandner 2008). Like the
Austro-Marxists, especially the neo-Kantian Max Adler, Neurath
rejected a radical materialist, mechanistic and economic reductionism,
valuing a plurality of institutions and cultural and educational
pursuits. The spirit of pluralism, revisionism and heterodoxy
Austro-Marxism introduced in Austrian political culture enabled
Neurath&rsquo;s hybrid, deflationary, critical views. Unlike Bauer and
Kautsky, however, or Schmoller&rsquo;s German Young Historical School
and corresponding members of Verein fur Sozialpolitik, he rejected
gradual change and partial socialization. Like his father, Wilhelm
Neurath, he advocated pan-cartelism, bringing together all industries
under government control, without immediate full nationalization
(expropriation) or replacement of expert owners and managers with
managing workers councils (Cartwright et al 1996, Uebel 1995, Nemeth
et al. 2008). </p>

<p>
Besides criticisms from the socialist camp, Neurath faced criticism
from early defenders of free-market economics: Max Weber, Ludwig von
Mises, and Friedrich von Hayek (Lavoie 1985, Chaloupek 1990, Vaughn
1994, O&rsquo;Neill 1998 and 2008, Steele 1999; Uebel 2004 and 2019;
Turk 2018; only O&rsquo;Neill acknowledges and does some justice to
Neurath&rsquo;s contribution). Neurath was thus drawn into
meta-theoretical debates over the rationality, objectivity and
informativeness of an economy. </p>

<p>
In the first volume of <em>Das Kapital</em> Marx opposed the
capitalist situation to that of primitive economies of the ancient
world and that of Robinson Crusoe in the fictional world.
Crusoe&rsquo;s economic evaluations and decisions are direct,
transparent, simple and rational. Marx writes: &lsquo;Necessity itself
compels (Robinson) to apportion his time accurately between his
different kinds of work. Whether one kind occupies a greater space in
his general activity than another depends on the difficulty, greater
or lesser as the case may be, to overcome in attaining the useful
effect aimed at. This our friend Robinson soon learns by
experience.&rsquo; And he adds: &lsquo;All the relations between
Robinson and the objects that form the wealth of his own creation are
here so simple and clear as to be intelligible without
exertion&hellip;And yet those relations contain all that is essential
to the determination of value.&rsquo; (Marx 1887/1973, vol 1, 81).
Robinson&rsquo;s planning becomes the model for a moneyless socialist
society. So for the case of society, Marx concluded: &lsquo;all the
characteristics of Robinson&rsquo;s labour are&hellip;repeated, but
with this difference, that they are social, instead of
individual.&rsquo; (Marx 1887/1973, vol. 1, 83). The difference
between the two situations is simply of degree, not of kind. The model
itself doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between the individual and the
social, and hence Robinson&rsquo;s situation can be said to be
qualitatively social through and through. In a more radical form, this
was also Marx&rsquo;s social view of language. In Marx and
Engel&rsquo;s <em>German Ideology</em> we can find the statement that
&lsquo;language, like consciousness, only arises from the need, the
necessity of intercourse with other men.&rsquo; (quoted in Neurath
1931b/1973, 351)</p>

<p>
For Weber, discussions of rationality and objectivity were central to
his inquiries into the sociology of power and bureaucracy and the
nature of scientific disciplines. A planned economy requires a
rational plan, and a rational plan requires in turn the possibility of
determining an outcome in the process of making a decision to take a
course of action. Outside the household, with its accounting largely
based on the use value of goods, the market of goods with exchange
value offers the possibility of using their monetary price as a
universal unit of value and calculation of profitability (Weber 1921).
This in turn determines the solutions to higher-order calculation
problems and, by inclusion, the outcomes of decision-making processes.
Moreover, the monetary calculation of profitability is as objective as
it is formal and precise. </p>

<p>
Mises pointed to commensurability as the root of objectivity of
rational calculation of decision of production and allocation of
consumption and production goods (Mises 1920/1935 and 1922). Socialism
in the form of Neurath&rsquo;s model of moneyless economy is, then,
<em>ex hypothese</em>, the abolition of rational economy (Mises
1920/1935, 110). Mises added a practical objection, in terms of one
individual, Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s capabilities: &lsquo;No single man
can ever master all the possibilities of production, innumerable as
they are, as to be in a position to make straightway evident judgments
of value without the aid of some system of computation.&rsquo; (in
Hayek 1935, 102). </p>

<p>
Hayek confronted Neurath on the problem of coordination of action in a
pluralistic society with dispersed knowledge. Hayek&rsquo;s criticisms
shared the Austrian cognitive (and practical) perspective, in his case
to consider the market an efficient and reliable
information-communication mechanism but the solution to the
coordination problem is non-discursive to the extent that all
information is communicated by relative prices. These are the
mechanism and information on which rational decision-making and
spontaneous coordination and cooperation (catallaxy) would be based
(Hayek 1935, O&rsquo;Neill 1998). </p>

<p>
Among Austrians, the debate was fought along a line that distinguished
two options only, either monetary market economy or moneyless central
planning. But Neurath entered the debate with an altogether different
notion of rationality, and of objectivity as well. Recall his
distinction between rationality and pseudorationality. The latter
&lsquo;treats everything as calculable&rsquo; (Neurath 1942/1973, 402)
and analyzable and representable by precise formulas. For Neurath, the
&lsquo;logical correctness&rsquo; of the method is not correlated with
its &lsquo;logical precision&rsquo; (Neurath 1935/1987, 71-72).
Neurath&rsquo;s solution to coordination and cooperation with
pluralism is discursive and humanist. The rationality of central
planning is based on the deliberative balancing of possible sets of
specific conditions and units that characterize different possible
life situations. It is also based on the fact that the choice is
somewhat determined by a given specific goal. Here Neurath offered a
corresponding boat analogy, this time a battleship from the context of
war economy, the original source of empirical data and motivation for
his model of moneyless economy:</p>

<p>
&lsquo;Besides modern commercial activities, military activities have
also been rationalized to a very high degree. &lsquo;Success in
battle&rsquo; is similar to &lsquo;gains in a venture&rsquo;. Now let
us see, e.g., how the captain of a battleship proceeds when he is
forced to fight far from home. As commanding officer, he takes into
account the course of the ship, the power of the engines, the range of
the guns, the stores of ammunition, the torpedoes, and the food
supplies, but certainly not the prices of the individual elements. He
bases his calculations on numerous specific units which he may even
represent to himself in graphic terms, as we can also imagine a
graphic representation of the economic plan of a natural macroeconomy.
This apparatus, which is rationalized through and through, is composed
of people and things, just like an economy, the only difference being
that the war apparatus is considered from the point of view of winning
a battle and an economy from the point of view of changing life
situations&hellip;The captain of the battleship does not have a
formula which would allow him to think of substituting a number of
torpedoes for a canon, or a number of men for an armoured plate. While
people readily admit that the military leadership can operate without
a general unit, they do not want to make the same assumption for the
economic leadership.&rsquo; (Neurath 1935/1987, 108)</p>

<p>
In 1928 he made a similar methodological point explicitly within the
context of economics:</p>

<blockquote>
The most careful and conscientious, perhaps statistical, consideration
of all circumstances does not give us a unit for calculation. How can
one numerically compare, beyond the amounts, things like the
protection of man-power with the protection of coal deposits? In spite
of the most careful assessment of all quantities, with due regard to
numerical estimated coal deposits yet unexploited, one can still not
mark each plan by a number obtained through additions and
subtractions, etc., and then take the plan which gives the biggest
number. Economic plans can be compared only in the way one compares
the pears and books; one can prefer one plan to another only on he
basis of a total estimate. (Neurath 1928/1973, 263-4)
</blockquote>

<p>
This total estimate, which constitutes the grounds for rationality,
commensurability and decision-making, is based on desired
configurations of social and economic goals. Examples of specific
economic goals for Neurath are the effective allocation of exhaustible
resources, the elimination of under-restricted production and
destruction of goods and the misuse of man-power that monetary
calculation allows. These goals may be more specific and are always
contingent. Empirical data make them available to the people&rsquo;s
representatives and decisions are then reached by common sense after
experts have conceived of and proposed a number of informed possible
theoretical alternatives:</p>

<p>
Comparison between wholes (plans) could not always rest on
commensurability of their parts: </p>

<blockquote>
The question might arise, should one protect coal mines or put greater
strain on men? The answer depends for example on whether one thinks
that hydraulic power may be sufficiently developed or that solar heat
might come to be better used, etc. If one believes the latter, one may
&lsquo;spend&rsquo; coal more freely and will hardly waste human
effort where coal can be used. If however one is afraid that when one
generation uses too much coal thousands will freeze to death in the
future, one might use more human power and save coal. Such and many
other non-technical matters determine the choice of a technically
calculable plan &hellip; we can see no possibility of reducing the
production plan to some kind of unit and then to compare the various
plans in terms of such units&hellip;. (Neurath 1928/1973, 263)
</blockquote>

<p>
The rationality of economic planning is, as it is for science
generally, not an arbitrary but a pragmatic matter. It does not lack a
model of justification, but Neurath&rsquo;s model differs from the one
adopted by Mises (O&rsquo;Neill 1998). It is in this sense that
Hayek&rsquo;s subsequent contribution with an emphasis on information
as the basis for an argument against central planning redefined the
calculation debates. For Neurath, to justify a belief or a decision
meant &lsquo;to show that it fits into the whole pattern of personal
life of which we approve.&rsquo;(Neurath 1928/1973, 249) Rationality
is thus based on historically and socially contingent values. It is
also fallible and equivocal. So in early as well as in later essays,
Neurath dismissed also in the economic context the appeal to
pseudorational precise calculations preferred on the mere grounds that
they might offer fixed outcomes to be considered the best.</p>

<p>
Regarding objectivity, Neurath made clear in &lsquo;What is Meant by a
Rational Economic Theory?&rsquo; that economic thinking in central
planning is committed to a &lsquo;consistently scientific
language&rsquo; and to &lsquo;objective connections&rsquo; (Neurath
1935/1987). This objectivity is provided by the language of
physicalism, of material things and structures in space and time, not
of physical theory. And it underwrites the generality of the scope of
economy in kind, from market goods and maximum profit to the welfare
of the population. As he put it, &lsquo;it is precisely the strict
physicalists, those who seek to carry out the program of unified
science, who have no objections to the concept
&lsquo;welfare&rsquo;.&rsquo;(ibid., 73) Objectivity and unification
go together once again. The unified language of physicalism guarantees
the public and social character of knowledge in the form of universal
statistics, often neglected or kept secret in capitalist systems. But
all this information, in the absence of the market, is the basis of
unified central planning. Hence, he stated in 1919, &lsquo;a socialist
economy knows no economic statistical secrets.&rsquo;(Neurath
1919/1974, 141) Finally, the objectivity of physicalism in the service
of central planning without money replaces the quantitative market
prices as universal equivalent or general unit with unified yet
specific units of kinds of things. Both general and specific units
contribute to their objective and scientific nature through the use of
numbers. Neurath emphasized that with a universal statistics of
specific units &lsquo; &lsquo;natural calculation&rsquo; is applicable
in all cases where there is talk of &lsquo;quantities of
welfare&rsquo;.&rsquo; (ibid., 72) But this leads to a less
reductionistic kind of conceptual unification. Whereas the monetary
general unit eliminates important differences among many kinds of
goods making them directly commensurable, the use of specific unit
allows for a general rational economics respecting heterogeneity among
kinds of things such as health and disease, which for Neurath are
&lsquo;not objects to be bought and sold.&rsquo; </p>

<p>
This anti-reductionistic attitude enabled Neurath to address
Mises&rsquo;s argument from complexity. But Neurath&rsquo;s notion of
social reality as a complex comprised of entities of different kinds
suggests a holistic approach to its description and prediction.
Planning and socialization can only take place for the whole and from
above. This holistic perspective demands unified knowledge of the
whole. </p>

<p>
Already in 1919 Neurath pointed out explicitly that successful
planning required a unified program. Subsequently, in the broader
context of scientific methodology Neurath argued that given the
complexity of social phenomena&mdash;often involving natural events-
successful prediction requires the unity of the sciences at the point
of action (Cat et al. 1996 and in Cartwright et al. 1996). Yet, for
him understanding of social groups rendered physical knowledge of the
behavior of the microscopic material constituents irrelevant. By the
time of Neurath&rsquo;s exile from Nazi Austria, he had come to
advocate the weaker notion of calculation in kind over the centrally
planned economies in kind. Yet the holistic scientific attitude to
planning was not out of his view of governance, whether of society or
science. Neurath would still speak in the early 1940s of the
&lsquo;orchestration of the sciences, and, correspondingly, in his
review of Hayek&rsquo;s <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> in 1945 he would
speak of planning as &lsquo;orchestration of ways of living&rsquo;
(Neurath 1945, 121). He would also write in 1943 in his essay
&lsquo;Planning or Managerial Revolution?&rsquo; that &lsquo;sometimes
it is less difficult to manage a bigger enterprise as a whole than the
smaller units which are its parts.&rsquo; (Neurath 1943, 153)</p>

<p>
Rationality, objectivity and unity, were for Neurath radically social.
Science is linked to society in at least three ways. Neurath, the
sociologist, showed through word and work that society falls within
scope of application of science. Neurath, the socialist, wanted
science, and scientific philosophy, to serve society by promoting
freedom and welfare. Neurath, the philosopher of science, argued that
science has social structure and values that must be shared by the
society to which it belongs. The republic of scientists is not
Plato&rsquo;s republic.</p>

<h1>The Human Genome Project</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Nov 26, 2008</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

The century that opened with rediscoveries of Gregor Mendel's
studies on patterns of inheritance in peas closed with a research
project in molecular biology heralded as the initial and necessary step
for attaining a complete understanding of the hereditary nature of
humankind. Both basic science and technological feat, the Human Genome
Project (HGP) brought to biology a &ldquo;big science&rdquo; model
previously confined to physics. Although originating and centered in
the U.S., laboratories across the globe contributed to the mapping and
sequencing of the haploid human genome's 22 autosomes and 2 sex
chromosomes.</p>

<p>

The official date of completion was timed to coincide with
celebrations of the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of James D. Watson and
Francis Crick's discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA.
On 12 April 2003, heads of government of the six countries which
contributed to the sequencing efforts (the U.S., the U.K., Japan,
France, Germany, and China) issued a joint proclamation that the
&ldquo;essential sequence of three billion base pairs of DNA of the
Human Genome, the molecular instruction book of human life,&rdquo; had
been achieved (Dept. of Trade 2003). HGP researchers compared their
feat to the Apollo moon landing and splitting the atom, foreseeing the
dawn of a new era, &ldquo;the era of the genome&rdquo; (NHGRI
2003).</p>

<p>

What does the &ldquo;era of the genome&rdquo; promise? Bruce
Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences, characterized
the completed human genome sequence as a &ldquo;tremendous foundation
on which to build the science and medicine of the 21<sup>st</sup>
century&rdquo; (NHGRI 2003). The statement released by the six world
leaders in April 2003 expressed the hope that this progress in science
and medicine would establish &ldquo;a healthier future for all the
peoples of the globe&rdquo; (Dept. of Trade 2003). Philosophical
interest in the HGP centers on claims and hopes of this sort and raises
a number of questions: How can DNA sequence information provide
foundations for scientific and medical knowledge? Who will have access
to the potential benefits arising from this research, and will such
benefits be justly distributed? What possible harms lie ahead?
</p>

<p>

This article provides a brief history of the HGP and discusses a
range of associated issues that gained the attention of philosophers
during the project's planning stages and as it unfolded.
Prominent among philosophical concerns are the conceptual foundations
of the project and its ethical implications.</p>

<h2><a name="BriHisHumGenPro">1. Brief History of the Human Genome Project</a></h2>

<p><strong>HGP at the start</strong></p>

<p>

The HGP began officially in October 1990, but its origins go back
earlier. In the mid-1980s, three scientists independently came up with
the idea of sequencing the entire human genome: Robert Sinsheimer, then
chancellor of University of California at Santa Cruz, as a way to spend
$30 million donated to his institution to build a telescope when that
project fell through; Salk Institute researcher Rene Dulbecco as a way
to understand the genetic origins of cancer and other diseases; and the
Department of Energy's (DOE's) Charles DeLisi as a way to
detect radiation-induced mutations, an interest of that agency since
the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Such a project had
become technically feasible due to advances made during the previous
decade or two: in the early 1970s, recombinant DNA technologies (use of
restriction enzymes to splice DNA, reverse transcriptase to make DNA
from RNA, viral vectors to carry bits of DNA into cells, bacterial
cloning to multiply quantities of DNA); in the late 1970s, DNA
sequencing and use of RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism)
markers for gene mapping; and in the early to mid-1980s, DNA synthesis,
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and
automated DNA sequencing.</p>

<p>

Sinsheimer's, Dulbecco's, and DeLisi's idea found
supporters among a number of prominent molecular biologists and human
geneticists&mdash;for example, Walter Bodmer, Walter Gilbert, Leroy
Hood, Victor McKusick, and James D. Watson. However, many molecular
biologists expressed misgivings. Especially through 1986 and 1987,
there were concerns about the routine nature of sequencing and the
amount of &ldquo;junk DNA&rdquo; that would be sequenced, that the
expense and big science approach would drain resources from smaller and
more worthy projects, and that knowledge of gene sequence was
inadequate to yield knowledge of gene
 function.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup>
In September 1986, committees
were established to study the feasibility of a publicly-funded project
to sequence the human genome: one by the National Research Council
(NRC) on scientific merit, and one by the Office for Technology
Assessment (OTA) as a matter of public policy. Both committees released
reports in 1988. The OTA report, <em>Mapping Our Genes: Genome
Projects: How Big, How Fast?</em> downplayed the concerns of scientist
critics by emphasizing that there was not one but many genome projects,
that these were not on the scale of the Manhattan or Apollo projects,
that no agency was committed to massive sequencing, and that the study
of other organisms was needed to understand human genes. The NRC
report, <em>Mapping and Sequencing the Human Genome</em>, sought to
accommodate the scientists&rsquo; concerns by formulating
recommendations that genetic and physical mapping and the development
of cheaper, more efficient sequencing technologies precede large-scale
sequencing, and that funding be provided for the mapping and sequencing
of nonhuman (&ldquo;model&rdquo;) organisms as well.</p>

<p>

It was the DOE that made the first push toward a &ldquo;Big
Science&rdquo; genome project: DeLisi advanced a five-year plan in
1986, $4.5 million was allocated from the 1987 budget, and recognizing
the boost the endeavor would provide to national weapons laboratories,
Senator Pete Domenici from New Mexico introduced a bill in Congress.
The DOE undertaking produced consternation among biomedical researchers
who were traditionally supported by the NIH's intramural and
extramural programs&mdash;for example, Caltech's David Botstein
referred to the initiative as &ldquo;DOE's program for unemployed
bomb-makers&rdquo; (in Cook-Deegan 1994, p. 98). James Wyngaarden, head
of the NIH, was persuaded to lend his agency's support to the
project in 1987. Funding was in place in time for fiscal year (FY) 1988
with Congress awarding the DOE $10.7 million and the NIH
$17.2
 million.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup>
The DOE
and NIH coordinated their efforts with a Memorandum of Understanding in
1988 that agreed on an official launch of the HGP on October 1, 1990
and an expected date of completion of 2005. Total cost estimated by the
NRC report was $3 billion. </p>

<p>

The project's specific goals at the outset were: (i) to
identify all genes of the human genome (initially estimated to be
100,000); (ii) to sequence the approximately 3 billion nucleotides of
the human genome; (iii) to develop databases to store this information;
(iv) to develop tools for data analysis; (v) to address ethical, legal,
and social issues; and (vi) to sequence a number of &ldquo;model
organisms,&rdquo; including the bacterium <em>Escherichia coli</em>,
the yeast <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em>, the roundworm
<em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>, the fruitfly <em>Drosophila
melanogaster</em>, and the mouse <em>Mus musculans</em>. The DOE
established three genome centers in 1988&ndash;89 at Lawrence Berkeley,
Lawrence Livermore, and Los Alamos National Laboratories; as Associate
Director of the DOE Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER),
David Galas oversaw the DOE's genome project from April 1990
until he left for the private sector in 1993. The NIH instituted a
university grant-based program for human genome research and placed
Watson, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA and director of Cold
Spring Harbor Laboratory, in charge in 1988. In October 1989, the
Department of Health and Human Services established the National Center
for Human Genome Research (NCHGR) at the NIH with Watson at the helm.
During 1990 and 1991, Watson expanded the grants-based program to fund
seven genome centers for five-year periods to work on large-scale
mapping projects: Washington University, St. Louis; University of
California, San Francisco; Massachusetts Institute of Technology;
University of Michigan; University of Utah; Baylor College of Medicine;
and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>

As the HGP got underway, a number of philosophers weighed in on its
scientific merit&mdash;in terms of cost, potential impact on other
areas of research, ability to lead to medical cures, and the usefulness
of sequence data (Kitcher 1995; Rosenberg 1995; Tauber and Sarkar 1992;
Vicedo 1992). However, of particular interest to philosophers is goal
(v) concerning ethical, legal, and social issues. At an October 1988
news conference called to announce his appointment, Watson, in an
apparently off-the-cuff response to a reporter who asked about the
social implications of the project, promised that a portion of the
funding would be set aside to study such issues (Marshall 1996c). The
result was the NIH/DOE Joint Working Group on Ethical, Legal, and
Social Implications (ELSI) of Human Genome Research, chaired by Nancy
Wexler, which began to meet in September
 1989.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup>
The Joint Working Group
identified four areas of high priority: &ldquo;quality and access in
the use of genetic tests; fair use of genetic information by employers
and insurers; privacy and confidentiality of genetic information; and
public and professional education&rdquo; (Wexler in Cooper 1994, p.
321). The NIH and DOE each established ELSI programs: philosopher Eric
T. Juengst served as the first director of the NIH-NCHGR ELSI program
from 1990 to 1994. ELSI was funded initially to the tune of three
percent of the HGP budget for both agencies; this was increased to four
and later five percent at the NIH.</p>

<p><strong>Map first, sequence later</strong></p>

<p>

As the NRC report had recommended, priority at the outset of the
project was given to mapping rather than sequencing the human genome.
HGP scientists sought to construct two kinds of maps. Genetic maps
order polymorphic markers linearly on chromosomes; the aim is to have
these markers densely enough situated that linkage relations can be
used to locate chromosomal regions containing genes of interest to
researchers. Physical maps order collections (or
&ldquo;libraries&rdquo;) of cloned DNA fragments that cover an
organism's genome; these fragments can then be replicated in
quantity for sequencing. The joint NIH-DOE five-year plan released in
1990 set specific benchmarks: a resolution of 2 to 5 centimorgans (cM)
for genetic linkage maps and physical maps with sequence-tagged site
(STS) markers (unique DNA sequences 100&ndash;200 base pairs long) spaced
approximately 100 kilobases (kb) apart and 2-megabase (Mb) contiguous
overlapping clones (&ldquo;contigs&rdquo;) assembled for large sections
of the genome. Sequencing needed to be made more efficient and less
costly: aims were to reduce sequencing costs to $.50 per base and to
complete 10 million bases of contiguous DNA (0.3 percent of the human
genome) but otherwise to focus efforts on the smaller genomes of less
complex model organisms (Watson 1990). HGP goals were facilitated by a
number of technological developments during this initial period. For
physical mapping, yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) introduced in
1987 (Burke et al. 1987) permitted much larger segments of DNA to be
ordered and stored for sequencing than was possible with plasmid or
cosmid libraries. A new class of genetic markers, microsatellite
repeats, was identified in 1989 (Litt and Luty 1989; Tautz 1989; Weber
and May 1989); because these sets of tandem repeats of short (either
dinucleotide, trinucleotide, or tetranucleotide) DNA sequences are more
highly polymorphic and detectable by PCR, microsatellites quickly
replaced RFLPs as markers of choice for genetic linkage mapping and
furnished the STS markers which facilitated the integration of genetic
and physical maps. Another technological achievement&mdash;the combined
use of reverse transcription, PCR, and automated sequencing to
map expressed genes&mdash;led to administrative changes at the NIH
when, in April 1992, Watson resigned from his position as director of
the NCHGR following a conflict with NIH director Bernadine Healy over
gene patenting. In 1991, while working at the NIH, J. Craig Venter
sequenced small portions of cDNAs from existing libraries to provide
identifying expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of 200&ndash;300 bases which he
then compared to already identified genes from various species found in
existing databases (Adams et al.
 1991).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup>
Watson disagreed with Healy's decision to
approve patent applications for the ESTs despite lack of knowledge of
their
 function.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup>
Soon after Watson's departure, Venter left NIH for the
private
 sector.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Francis Collins, an MD-PhD whose lab at University of Michigan
co-discovered genes associated with cystic fibrosis and
neurofibromatosis and contributed to efforts to isolate the gene for
Huntington's disease, was appointed by Healy as Watson's
replacement, and he began at the NCHGR in April 1993. Collins
established an intramural research program at the NCHGR to complement
the extramural program of grants for university-based research which
already existed; ELSI remained a grant-funded program. The original
NIH-DOE five-year plan was updated in 1993. The new five-year plan, in
effect through 1998, accommodated progress that had been made in
mapping, sequencing, and technological development (Collins and Galas
1993). The goal of a 2&ndash;5 cM genetic map was expected to be met by the
1995 target date. The deadline for a physical map with STS markers at
intervals of 100 kb was extended to 1998; a map with intervals
averaging 300 kb was expected by 1995 or 1996. Although the goal of
$.50 per base cost of sequencing was projected to be met by 1996, it
was recognized that this would be insufficient to meet the 2005 target
date. The updated goal was to build up to a collective sequencing
capacity of 50 Mb per year and to have 80 Mb of DNA (from both human
and model organism genomes) sequenced by the end of 1998. This would be
achieved by increasing the number of groups working on large-scale
sequencing and heightening efforts to develop new sequencing
technologies. Accordingly, in November 1995, the U.K.'s Wellcome
Trust launched a $75 million, seven-year concentrated sequencing effort
at the Sanger Centre in Cambridge, and in April 1996, the NCHGR awarded
grants totaling $20 million per year for six centers (Houston's
Baylor College of Medicine, Stanford University, The Institute for
Genomic Research [TIGR], University of Washington-Seattle, Washington
University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Whitehead Institute for
Biomedical Research&mdash;MIT Genome Center) to pilot high-volume
sequencing approaches (Marshall 1996a).</p>

<p>

Although the HGP's inceptions were in the U.S., it had not
taken long for mapping and sequencing the human genome to become an
international venture (see Cook-Deegan 1994). France began to fund
genome research in 1988 and had developed a more centralized, although
not very well-funded, program by 1990. More significant were the
contributions of Centre d&rsquo;Etudes du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH)
and G&eacute;n&eacute;thon. CEPH, founded in 1983 by Jean Dausset,
maintained a collection of DNA donated by intergenerational families to
help in the study of hereditary disease; Jean Weissenbach led an
international effort to construct a complete genetic map of the human
genome using the CEPH collection; later, with funding from the French
muscular dystrophy association (AFM), director Daniel Cohen set out to
construct a YAC clone library for physical mapping and oversaw the
launching of G&eacute;n&eacute;thon in 1991 as an industrial-sized
mapping and sequencing operation funded by the AFM. The U.K.'s
genome project received its official start in 1989 although Sydney
Brenner had commenced genome research at the Medical Research Council
(MRC) laboratory several years before this. MRC funding was
supplemented with private monies from the Imperial Cancer Research
Fund, and later, the Wellcome Trust. The Sanger Centre, led by John
Sulston and funded by Wellcome and the MRC, opened in October 1993. A
combined four-year, 15-million-euro genome program by the European
Community (E.C.) commenced in 1990. Germany, its citizens all too aware
of abuses in the name of genetics, lagged behind other European
countries: although individual researchers received government funds
for genome research in the late-1980s and participated in the E.C.
initiative, no actual national genome project was undertaken until 1995
(Kahn 1996). Japan, ahead of the U.S. in having funded the development
of automated sequencing technologies since the early 1980s, was the
major genome player outside the U.S. and Europe with several government
agencies beginning small-scale genome projects in the late-1980s and
early- 1990s, but a frequent target of U.S. criticism for the size of
its investment relative to
 GNP.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup>
China was the latecomer on the international
scene: with 250 million yuan ($30 million) over three years from
government and industry, the Chinese National Human Genome Center with
branches in Beijing and Shanghai opened in July 1998, and was followed
in 1999 by the Beijing Genomics
 Institute.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup></p>

As 1998, the last year of the revised five-year plan and midpoint of
the project's projected 15-year span, approached, many mapping
goals had been met. In 1994, G&eacute;n&eacute;thon completed a genetic
map with more than 2000 microsatellite markers at an average spacing of
2.9 cM and only one gap larger than 20 cM (Gyapay et al. 1994), though
the genetic mapping phase of the project did not finally come to a
close until March 1996 with publication of comprehensive genetic maps
of the mouse and human genomes in <em>Nature</em>: the mouse map
produced by scientists at Whitehead-MIT Center for Genome Research
contained 7,377 genetic markers (both microsatellites and RFLPs) with
an average spacing of 0.2 cM (Dietrich et al. 1996); the human map
produced by scientists at G&eacute;n&eacute;thon contained 5,264
microsatellite markers located to 2335 positions with an average
spacing of 1.6 cM (Dib et al. 1996). Physical mapping was on track: in
1995, a physical map with 94 percent coverage of the genome and STS
markers at average intervals of 199 kb was published (T. Hudson et al.
1995), as was CEPH's updated physical map of 225 YAC contigs
covering 75 percent of the genome (Chumakov et al. 1995); however,
bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs), developed in DOE-funded
research at Caltech in 1992 (Shizuya et al. 1992), soon replaced YACs
because of their greater stability in propagating DNA for sequencing.
Sequencing itself presented more of a challenge. The genomes of the
smallest model organisms had been sequenced. In April 1996, an
international consortium of mostly European laboratories published the
sequence for <em>S. cerevisiae</em> which was the first eukaryote
completed, with 12 million base pairs and 5,885 genes and at a cost of
$40 million (Goffeau et al. 1996). In January 1997, University of
Wisconsin researchers completed the sequence of <em>E. coli</em> with
4,638,858 base pairs and 4,286 genes (Blattner et al. 1997). However,
despite ramped-up sequencing efforts over the past several years at the
Sanger Centre and NHGRI-funded centers (the NCHGR had been elevated to
the status of a research institute in 1997 and renamed the National
Human Genome Research Institute), with only three percent of the human
genome sequenced, sequencing costs hovering at $.40/base, and the
desired high-output not yet achieved by the sequencing centers, and
about $1.8 billion spent, doubts existed about whether the target date
of 2005 could be met.</p>

<p>

Suddenly, the HGP found itself challenged by sequencing plans from
the private sector. In May 1998, TIGR's Venter announced he would
partner with Michael Hunkapiller's company Applied Biosystems
(ABI), a division of Perkin-Elmer Corporation which manufactured
sequencing machines, to form a new company which would sequence the
entire genome in three short years and for a fraction of the cost. The
foreseen profits rested in the construction of a
&ldquo;definitive&rdquo; database that would outdo Genbank by
integrating medical and other information with the basic sequence and
polymorphisms. The company, based in Rockville, MD and later named
Celera Genomics, planned to use &ldquo;whole-genome shotgun&rdquo;
(WGS) sequencing, an approach different from the HGP's. The HGP
confined the shotgun method to cloned fragments already mapped to
specific chromosomal regions: these are broken down into smaller bits
then amplified by bacterial clones, sequences are generated randomly by
automated machines, and computational resources are used to reassemble
sequence using overlapping areas of bits. Shotgunning is followed by
painstaking &ldquo;finishing&rdquo; to fill in gaps, correct mistakes,
and resolve ambiguities. What Celera was proposing for the shotgun
method was to break the organism's entire genome into millions of
pieces of DNA with high-frequency sound waves, sequence these pieces
using hundreds of ABI's new capillary model machines, and
reassemble the sequences with one of the world's largest civilian
supercomputers without the assistance provided by the preliminary
mapping of clones to chromosomes. When WGS sequencing was considered as
a possibility by the HGP, it was rejected because of the risk that
repeat sequences would yield mistakes in
 reassembly.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#9" name="note-9">9</a>]</sup>
But Venter by this time had
successfully used the technique to sequence the 1.83 million nucleotide
bases of the bacterium <em>Hemophilus influenzae</em>&mdash;the first
free-living organism to be completely sequenced&mdash;in a year's
time (Fleischmann et al.
 1995).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#10" name="note-10">10</a>]</sup></p>

<p><strong>Race to the genome</strong></p>

<p>

The race to sequence the genome was on. The publicly-funded
scientists downplayed the media image of a race often over the next
couple of years, but they were certainly propelled by worries that
funding would dry up before the sequence was complete given private
sector willingness to take over and that the sequence data would become
proprietary information&mdash;the Bermuda Accord, agreed to in February
1996 by the world's major sequencing laboratories which at the
time included Venter's TIGR, required the public release of
sequence data every 24 hours. Wellcome more than doubled its funds to
the Sanger Centre (to &pound;205 million) and the center changed its
goal from sequencing one-sixth of the genome to sequencing one-third,
and possibly one-half (Dickson 1998). The NHGRI and DOE published a new
five-year plan for 1998-2003 (Collins et al. 1998). The plan moved the
final completion date forward from 2005 to 2003 and aimed for a
&ldquo;working draft&rdquo; of the human genome sequence to be
completed by December 2001. This would be achieved by delaying the
finishing process, no longer going clone-by-clone to shotgun,
reassemble, and finish the sequence of one clone before proceeding to
the next. A physical map of 41,664 STS markers was soon published
(Deloukas et al. 1998), and so the physical mapping goal was met, but
with only six percent of the human genome sequence completed, the plan
called for new and improved sequencing technologies which could
increase the sequencing capacity from 90 Mb per year at about $.50 per
base to 500 Mb per year at no more than $.25 per base. Goals for
completing the sequencing of the remaining model organisms were also
set: December 1998 for <em>C. elegans</em> which was 80 percent
complete, 2002 for <em>D. melanogaster</em> which was nine percent
complete, and 2005 for <em>M. musculus</em> which was still at the
physical mapping stage.</p>

<p>

An interim victory for the publicly-funded project followed when, on
schedule, the first animal sequence, that of <em>C. elegans</em> with
97 million bases and 19,099 genes, was published in <em>Science</em> in
December 1998 (<em>C. elegans</em> Sequencing Consortium 1998). This
was the product of a 10-year collaboration between scientists at
Washington University (headed by Bob Waterston) and the Sanger Centre
(headed by John Sulston), carried out at a semi-industrial scale with
more than 200 people employed in each lab working around the clock. In
March 1999, the main players&mdash;the NHGRI, Sanger Centre, and
DOE&mdash;advanced the date of completion of the &ldquo;working
draft&rdquo;: five-fold coverage of at least 90 percent of the genome
was to be completed by the following spring (Pennisi 1999; Wadman
1999). This change reflected improved output of the new model of
automated sequencing machines, diminished sequencing costs at $.20 to
$.30 per base, and the desire to speed up the release of medically
relevant data. NHGRI would take responsibility for 60 percent of the
sequence, concentrating these efforts at only three centers with
Baylor, Washington University, and Whitehead-MIT sharing $81.6 million
over the ensuing 10 months; 33 percent of the sequence would be the
responsibility of the Sanger Centre whose funds from Wellcome increased
from $57 million to $77 million for the year; and the remaining
sequence would be supplied by the DOE's Joint Genome Institute
(JGI) in Walnut Creek, CA into which its three centers had merged in
January 1997. The smaller international centers involved in sequencing
were not consulted on this restructuring, but were later brought on
board on the condition that they could keep up with the pace. The first
chromosomes to be completed (and this was to finished, not working
draft, standards) were the two smallest: the sequence for chromosome 22
was published by scientists at the Sanger Centre and partners at
University of Oklahoma, Washington University in St. Louis and Keio
University in Japan in December 1999 (Dunham et al. 1999); the sequence
for chromosome 21 was published by an international consortium of
mostly Japanese and German labs&mdash;half at RIKEN&mdash;in May 2000
(Hattori et al. 2000). The remaining chromosomes lagged behind, though
the DOE announced completion of working drafts of chromosomes 5, 16,
and 19 with three-fold coverage in April 2000. The progress made by the
publicly-funded project could be monitored because sequence data were
released at 24-hour intervals, but Celera's progress was more
difficult to assess. HGP scientist Maynard Olson charged that Celera
was doing &ldquo;science by press conference&rdquo; (in Davies 2002, p.
153). Certainly, Celera's press conferences gave the impression
it was ahead in the race: on 10 January 2000 the company announced
completion of 90 percent of the human genome sequence, and on 6 April
2000 the company announced completion of three-fold coverage of the DNA
of one male donor. But there was also evidence that Celera did remain a
threat: the validity of the WGS sequencing approach was demonstrated in
March 2000 when Celera and the (publicly-funded) Berkeley Drosophila
Genome Project published the sequence of <em>D. melanogaster</em> of
about 180 Mb (Adams et al. 2000).</p>

<p>

In June 2000, the contest ended in what appeared to be a tie for the
prize, but was more an arranged truce. On 26 June 2000, Collins,
Venter, and the DOE's Ari Patrinos joined U.S. President Bill
Clinton (and British Prime Minister Tony Blair by satellite link) at a
White House press conference to announce that the human genome had been
sequenced. That Collins and Venter even shared the limelight on that
day was itself a tremendous feat. The negotiated draw at the finish
line permitted HGP scientists to save face and their upstart competitor
to minimize the risk of alienating university-based researchers and
losing their business. The agreement between parties included eventual
simultaneous publication of their results. However, not only had
results not yet been readied for publication, neither of the two
sequence maps was complete (Pennisi 2000). The HGP had not met its
previous year's goal of a working draft covering 90 percent of
the genome: Collins reported that ordered BACs existed for 97 percent
of the genome and that BACs for 85 percent of the genome had been
sequenced, with 24 percent of the genome sequence in finished form, 22
percent of the genome sequence in near-finished form, and 38 percent of
the genome sequence in provisional form. Assisted by its
researchers&rsquo; access to HGP data stored on public databases,
Celera's efforts were accepted as being further along: the
company's press release that day announced completion of the
&ldquo;first assembly&rdquo; of the human genome with 99 percent
coverage. An editorial in <em>Nature</em> described the fanfare of 26
June as an &ldquo;extravagant&rdquo; example&mdash;one reaching
&ldquo;an all-out zenith or nadir, according to taste&rdquo;&mdash;of
scientists making public announcements not linked to peer-reviewed
publication, here to bolster share prices (Celera) and for political
effect (the HGP) given the &ldquo;months to go before even a draft
sequence will be scientifically useful&rdquo; (Anonymous 2000, p. 981).
The peer-reviewed publications came almost eight months later. Plans
for joint publication in <em>Science</em> broke down when terms of
agreement over data release could not be negotiated:
<em>Science</em>'s editors were willing to publish Celera's
findings without Venter meeting the standard requirement that the
sequence data be submitted to GenBank; Celera would instead make the
data available on its own website. Press conferences in London and
Washington, D.C. on 12 February preceded publications that
week&mdash;by HGP scientists in <em>Nature</em> on 15 February 2001 and
by Venter's team in <em>Science</em> on 16 February 2001. The HGP
draft genome sequence, prepared based on map and sequence data
available on 8 October 2000, covered about 94 percent of the genome,
with about 25 percent in the finished form already attained for
chromosomes 21 and 22. Indeed, the authors themselves described it as
&ldquo;an incomplete, intermediate product&rdquo; which &ldquo;contains
many gaps and errors&rdquo; (International Human Genome Sequencing
Consortium 2001, p. 871). The results published by Celera, based on
assemblies completed on 1 October 2001 using two different
computational methods, had 84&ndash;90 percent of the genome covered by
scaffolds at least 100 kb in length, with the composition of the
scaffolds averaging 91&ndash;92 percent sequence and 8&ndash;9 percent gaps,
leaving 93,857&ndash;105,264 gaps in total (Venter et al. 2001). In the end,
Celera's published genome assembly made significant use of the
HGP's publicly available map and sequence data, which left open
the question whether WGS sequencing alone would have
 worked.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#11" name="note-11">11</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Since the gaps in the sequence were unlikely to contain genes, and
only genes as functional segments of DNA have potential commercial
value, Celera was happy to move on and leave these gaps for the HGP
scientists to fill in. Celera was faced with deciding what sort of
company it would be: sequences from three different mouse strains were
added to help attract subscribers to its database, and a brief foray
was made into proteomics, but Venter resigned as CEO in January 2002
with the company's decision to focus on drug discovery rather
than information (Davies 2002). Despite being timed to coincide with
celebrations of the 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Watson-Crick
discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA, there was less
fanfare surrounding the official date of completion of the HGP in April
2003, two years earlier than had been anticipated at the time of its
official launch in October 1990, and several months earlier than called
for in the most recent five-year plan. Americans had terrorism and war
on their minds. In the end, sequencing&mdash;the third phase of the
publicly-funded project&mdash;was carried out at 16 centers in six
countries by divvying up among them sections of chromosomes for
sequencing. 85 percent of the sequencing, however, was done at the five
major sequencing centers (Baylor, Washington University, Whitehead-MIT,
Sanger Center, and DOE's JGI), with the Sanger Centre responsible
for nearly one-third. The cost was lower than anticipated, with $2.7
billion spent by U.S. agencies and &pound;150 million spent by Wellcome
Trust. The &ldquo;finished&rdquo; reference DNA sequence for <em>Homo
sapiens</em>&mdash;all 3.1 billion nucleotide bases&mdash;is publicly
accessible on the Internet
 (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/" target="other">NCBI Human Genome Resources</a>).
If the As, Ts, Cs, and Gs of the genome sequence were printed in
standard type, they would fill 75,490 pages of the <em>New York
Times</em> (Wade
 2003).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

In the project's early years, Norton Zinder, who chaired the
NIH's Program Advisory Committee for the Human Genome,
characterized it in this way: &ldquo;This Project is creating an
infrastructure for doing science; it's not the doing of the
science per se. it will provide the biological community with the basic
materials for doing research in human biology&rdquo; (in Cooper 1994,
p. 74). The published human genome reference sequences are part of that
infrastructure, serving as tools for investigating human genetic
variation. So far gene identification has been successful for the
single genes of large effect implicated in rare Mendelian disorders.
Difficulties arise for identifying the multiple genes of variable
effect that interact with nongenetic factors in more common, complex
conditions and for understanding the physiological processes associated
with the development of these phenotypes. One approach to overcoming
these difficulties focuses on relatively genetically homogeneous
populations with members for whom extensive clinical data are
available, as in the case of the Icelandic genome project, and
basically extends the methods used for linkage mapping for diseases
within families. Another approach is to conduct large-scale
case-control association studies between phenotypes of interest and
genetic markers. For both these approaches, single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) are preferred as markers over the microsatellites
used for genetic and physical mapping by the HGP. Worried about the
private sector's efforts to patent SNPs, which would make them
costly to use for research, the NHGRI-DOE's five-year plan for
1998&ndash;2003 included the goal of mapping 100,000 SNPs by 2003 (Collins et
al. 1998). The development of a public database of SNPs received a $138
million push from the International HapMap Project, a three-year
public-private partnership completed in 2005 that mapped variation in
four population groups. The NHGRI's involvement in the HapMap
Project was part of the continuing leadership role in genome research
it envisioned for itself upon completion of the HGP (Collins et al.
2003). Other projects include ENCODE, which began as a pilot project to
study gene function by analyzing one percent of the genome and is now
looking at the remaining 99 percent, and more recently, clinENCODE, in
which disease risk is being calculated for 400 people based on the
corresponding one percent of the genome as a step toward personalized
medicine. However, the infrastructure of mapping and sequencing
technologies developed as part of the HGP&mdash;especially the ability
to sequence entire genomes of organisms&mdash;has changed the way
biology, not just human biology, is done. It is now recognized that
genome structure by itself tells us only so much. In functional
genomics, the interest is in how genomes&mdash;not just individual
genes anymore&mdash;function. By studying the coordinated expression of
the genome's various segments in different tissues at different
times, researchers are coming to better understand organismal
development. In comparative genomics, the study of genomic structure
and function in different species is bringing about similar gains in
understanding evolution. And genomics is now complemented by the field
of proteomics which studies the structure and function of all of an
organism's proteins, called the proteome.</p>

<h2><a name="HumGenPro">2. Philosophy and the Human Genome Project</a></h2>

<p>

At the June 2000 White House press conference, President Clinton
compared the feat of mapping and sequencing the human genome to the
mapping of the Northwest Passage by early-nineteenth century explorers
Meriwether Lewis and William Clark:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Nearly two centuries ago, in this room, on this floor, Thomas
Jefferson and a trusted aide spread out a magnificent map, a map
Jefferson had long prayed he would get to see in his lifetime. The aide
was Meriwether Lewis and the map was the product of his courageous
expedition across the American frontier, all the way to the
Pacific. It was a map that defined the contours and forever
expanded the frontiers of our continent and our imagination.</p>

<p>

Today the world is joining us here in the East Room to behold the
map of even greater significance. We are here to celebrate the
completion of the first survey of the entire human genome.
Without a doubt, this is the most important, most wondrous map ever
produced by humankind.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>

Clinton continued on to say that he considered this
&ldquo;epoch-making triumph of science and reason&rdquo; to be merely
a starting point. Three &ldquo;majestic horizons&rdquo; lay
immediately ahead: by 2003, production of a final version of the
sequence map that would be complete and accurate; biotechnological
development in the private sector based on the identification of all
human genes and their functions; and ethical respect for &ldquo;our
oldest and most cherished human values&rdquo; to ensure that genome
science benefits &ldquo;all citizens of the world,&rdquo; protects
privacy, and prevents discrimination (White House 2000).</p>

<p>

Clinton's comparison of the human genome sequence map to Lewis
and Clark's map of the Northwest Passage is perhaps less
gratuitous than it might appear. Some members of the 1804&ndash;1806
expedition, the &ldquo;Corps of Discovery,&rdquo; sought to obtain
natural scientific and anthropological knowledge over the course of
their travels. The HGP shares the Enlightenment ideals of this period,
especially the faith in scientific progress, the goal of systematic
knowledge, and the confidence that universal benefits for humanity
would ensue from the scientific pursuit of truth. Scientist Leroy Hood
expressed the belief that &ldquo;we will learn more about human
development and pathology in the next twenty-five years than we have in
the past two thousand&rdquo; (1992, p. 163). He predicted that the HGP
would facilitate movement from a reactive to preventive mode of
medicine which would &ldquo;enable most individuals to live a normal,
healthy, and intellectually alert life without disease&rdquo; (p. 158).
The Lewis and Clark journey was an important symbol for encouraging
Americans to move westward (the frontier was declared gone by 1890);
similarly, &ldquo;getting&rdquo; the genome was represented by HGP
proponents as a &ldquo;frontier&rdquo; of knowledge that, like the moon
landing, needed to be conquered. But most important are the colonialist
and economic aims associated with this early nineteenth-century
&ldquo;voyage of discovery.&rdquo; Jefferson sought to establish a U.S.
presence beyond its borders, in lands long inhabited by peoples
indigenous to the Americas and to which Spain had already staked its
claim. He made clear to Lewis that the principal aim of the journey was
commercial: &ldquo;<em>The Object of your mission is to explore the
Missouri river &amp; such principal stream of it as by it's course and
communication with the waters of the Pacific ocean, whether the
Columbia, Oregon, Colorado or any other river may offer the most direct
&amp; practicable water communication across this continent for the
purpose of commerce</em>&rdquo;
 (<a href="http://www.lewis-clark.org/" target="other"><em>Discovering Lewis &amp; Clark</em></a>).
The infrastructure to be developed with the HGP was similarly presented
as an opportunity to &ldquo;secure the leadership of the United
States in biotechnology and present U.S. industry with a wealth of
opportunities&rdquo; (Hood 1992, p. 163). Legislative changes were
enacted in the 1980s to encourage the commercial development of
federally funded research: universities and other nonprofit
institutions were allowed to apply for patents on such research and tax
incentives were provided to the private sector to encourage investment.
Although Lewis and Clark depended extensively throughout their journey
on the assistance of Indians and French traders they encountered, they
regarded the lands they covered as &ldquo;virgin territory&rdquo; that
awaited the arrival of &ldquo;civilized men&rdquo; to be named and
claimed. Similar attitudes are implicated in controversies over the
commercialization of genomics research and intellectual property and
patent rights: organizations representing indigenous peoples charge
that the patenting of human genes and cell lines is a continuation of
the &ldquo;bioprospecting&rdquo; and &ldquo;biopiracy&rdquo; carried
out by multinational corporations in securing patents on medicinal and
food uses of plants which have been long a part of traditional
knowledge (Shiva 1996).</p>

<p>

In the early years of the HGP, the DOE's David Galas expressed
skepticism that ELSI-sorts of concerns were anything new: &ldquo;there
are no <em>new</em> problems. Issues concerning privacy,
confidentiality, and discrimination will become much more pressing once
the Genome Project generates the tools to diagnose diseases
presymptomatically. The <em>basic</em> problems, however, are not
new&mdash;they will simply be exacerbated&rdquo; (in Cooper 1994, p.
167). Although legal scholar George Annas agreed there were no new
problems, he argued that the combination and degree of problems
involved did make the HGP unique: &ldquo;there are probably no
<em>unique</em> issues raised by the Human Genome Initiative. On the
other hand, this project raises <em>all</em> of the issues in a much
more focused manner (certainly a difference in degree if not in kind),
and the fact that all of these issues are implicated in the project may
itself make the project societally unique&rdquo; (1990, p. 640). Many
of the issues are of interest to philosophers: these include conceptual
questions pertaining to scientific knowledge itself and the ethical
ramifications of such knowledge and related technological developments.
Philosophers of science, ethicists, political theorists and
philosophers working in other areas have benefited from ELSI-related
funding. There is now a vast literature on human genome-related topics,
and this entry can do no more than provide a synopsis regarding what
questions have been asked, what range of responses has been offered,
and what remains for philosophical attention and debate.</p>

<h3><a name="ConFouHumGenPro">2.1 Conceptual Foundations of the Human Genome Project</a></h3>

<h4>2.1.1. Gene concept</h4>

<p>

Bets placed during the HGP over how many genes would be discovered,
as well as surprise expressed when far fewer than the original estimate
were found (about 25,000&ndash;30,000 rather than 100,000&mdash;the rice
genome apparently has more genes!) (Normile and Pennisi 2002; Pennisi
2003), suggest that &ldquo;gene&rdquo;&mdash;a term introduced by
Wilhelm Johannsen in 1909&mdash;names a well-defined concept. The
report that because of alternate splicing each gene is responsible for
three or four proteins makes the same assumption. As does drawing
distinctions between normal and abnormal genes, or seeking to isolate
disease genes. The assumption is not very well substantiated, however.
Philosophers of biology recognize that the genes of classical genetics,
molecular genetics, evolutionary genetics, and more recently
developmental genetics do not necessarily map onto each
 other.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup>
Difficulties
arriving at a definitive gene concept arise even when we confine
ourselves to contemporary molecular biology. Evelyn Fox Keller (2000)
points out an irony which has ensued from the HGP's successes:
even though gene-talk is more pervasive than ever in the popular and
scientific presses, the concept of the gene, whether defined
structurally or functionally, has been &ldquo;radically
undermined&rdquo; (p. 5). Keller provides this description of current
laboratory practices: &ldquo;As we listen to the ways in which the term
is now used by working biologists, we find that the gene has become
many things&mdash;no longer a single entity but a word with great
plasticity, defined only by the specific experimental context in which
it is used&rdquo; (p. 69).</p>

<p>

Recent philosophical efforts to define genes have sought to capture
these practices. C. Kenneth Waters (1994) recognizes that specific
research contexts determine whether genes are considered to include
introns as well as exons, or regulatory or promoter regions as well as
open reading frames (ORFs), but argues that what remains
&ldquo;fundamental&rdquo; across these contexts is the concept of a
gene as a stretch of DNA the linear sequence of which provides a
template for a gene product, whether mRNA transcript or polypeptide.
Because of problems posed for Waters&rsquo; account by mRNA splicing
and editing, Eva Neumann-Held (1999) recommends replacing the
&ldquo;classical molecular gene concept&rdquo; of a stretch of DNA
coding for a single polypeptide with a &ldquo;molecular process gene
concept&rdquo; which includes not just the relevant stretches of DNA
but the entire cellular context in which polypeptides are produced.
Lenny Moss (2003) identifies two gene concepts: the preformationist
gene, Gene-P, defined by its relationship to a phenotype, is of
instrumental utility for molecular geneticists&mdash;for example, the
BRCA1 gene is used to predict breast cancer risk; the epigenesist gene,
Gene-D, defined by its molecular sequence, serves as a
&ldquo;developmental resource&rdquo; in providing a template for RNA
and protein synthesis but is indeterminate with respect to phenotype
since this depends on other developmental resources and the cellular
and extracellular
 contexts.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#14" name="note-14">14</a>]</sup>
Paul Griffiths and Karola Stotz (2006)
distinguish three gene concepts: &ldquo;instrumental genes&rdquo;
remain important in molecular genetics when relationships between
genotype and phenotype are under investigation; &ldquo;nominal
molecular genes&rdquo; are specific DNA sequences annotated by
researchers as genes for structural reasons such as presence of ORFs;
&ldquo;postgenomic molecular genes&rdquo; are not defined by structure
but &ldquo;by the way DNA sequences are used in particular cellular and
broader contexts&rdquo; (p. 515).</p>

<p>

Given this context-dependence in what genes are considered to be and
do, it seems that pluralism has become the order of the day, for genes
as for species. Along these lines, John Dupr&eacute; (2004) advocates
&ldquo;an atheoretical pluralism&rdquo; that abandons any pretence to a
&ldquo;theoretical core to the concept&rdquo;: simply, &ldquo;a gene is
any bit of DNA that anyone has reason to name and keep track of&rdquo;
(pp.
 332&ndash;333).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#15" name="note-15">15</a>]</sup>
Keller (2000) agrees that the theoretical
importance of genes has faded; she writes: &ldquo;it seems evident that
the primacy of the gene as the core explanatory concept of biological
structure and function is more a feature of the twentieth century than
it will be of the twenty-first&rdquo; (p. 9). She forecasts the
emergence of new language; this is a situation for which Philip Kitcher
believed molecular biology was ripe even 15 years ago when he wrote:
&ldquo;it is hard to see what would be lost by dropping talk of genes
from molecular biology and simply discussing the properties of various
interesting regions of nucleic acid&rdquo; (1992, p. 130). Keller
believes that gene-talk has served a purpose though, providing a
flexibility which permits communication across those specific
experimental practices within which &ldquo;gene&rdquo; attains
precision. Hans-J&ouml;rg Rheinberger (2000) takes this argument one
step further: gene concepts are not merely useful in spite of their
ambiguity, they are useful in virtue of their ambiguity because, as
&ldquo;tools of research, they must reach out into the realm of what we
do not yet know&rdquo; (p. 223). He reminds us that this is nothing
new: &ldquo;The spectacular rise of molecular biology has come about
without a comprehensive, exact, and rigid definition of what a gene
is&rdquo; (p. 222). Keller's and Rheinberger's views
present an evident challenge to philosophical intuitions that
scientific practice is furthered by arriving at precise definitions of
basic concepts.</p>

<h4>2.1.2 Identity and difference</h4>

<p>

Early in the debates surrounding plans for the HGP, questions arose
concerning what it means to map and sequence <em>the</em> human
genome&mdash;&ldquo;get the genome,&rdquo; as Watson (1992) put it.
About these concerns, McKusick (1989) wrote: &ldquo;The question often
asked, especially by journalists, is &lsquo;Whose genome will be
sequenced?&rsquo; The answer is that it need not, and surely will not,
be the genome of any one person. Keeping track of the origin of the DNA
that is studied will be important, but the DNA can come from different
persons chosen for study for particular parts of the genome&rdquo; (p.
913). The HGP and Celera reference sequences are indeed composites
based on chromosomal segments that originate from different
individuals: the sequence in any given region of the genome belongs to
a single individual, but sequences in different regions of the genome
belong to different individuals. However, in both cases, the majority
of the sequence originates from just one person. As HGP sequencing
efforts accelerated, concerns arose that only four genomes, a couple of
which belonged to known laboratory personnel, were being used for
physical mapping and sequencing (Marshall 1996b). The decision was made
to construct 10 new clone libraries for sequencing with each library
contributing about 10 percent of the total DNA. In the end, 74.3
percent of the total number of bases sequenced was derived from a
single clone library&mdash;that of a male, presumably from the Buffalo
area; seven other clone libraries contributed to an additional 17.3
percent of the sequence (International Human Genome Sequencing
Consortium 2001, p. 866). A similar proportion&mdash;close to 71
percent&mdash;of the Celera sequence belongs to just one male even
though five ethnically diverse donors were selected; incredibly enough,
rumors have been confirmed that this individual is Venter himself
(McKie 2002).</p>

<p>

The deeper question, of course, is how we might understand a single
human genome sequence, a composite that belongs to no actual individual
in its entirety and only a handful of individuals in its parts, to be
representative of the entire species. This seems to ignore the
extensive genetic variability which exists. The functional equivalence
of many DNA polymorphisms led two early critics of the HGP to argue
that &ldquo;there simply is no such entity as a &lsquo;representative
sequence&rsquo; or the human (or any) genome&rdquo; making it
&ldquo;fallacious and even dangerous to call any one
&lsquo;normal&rsquo;&rdquo; (Sarkar and Tauber 1991, p. 691). Another
critic pointed out that problems with the idea of a representative
sequence persist even when consideration is limited to DNA differences
that are not functionally equivalent but related to health and disease:
the sequence will contain unknown defective genes (since no one,
including donors, is free of these), there is a heterogeneity of
mutations even in so-called single gene diseases, and it is impossible
to identify the genetic basis of a disorder simply by comparing the
sequences of sick and well people since there will be many differences
between them (Lewontin 2000 [1992]). For Gilbert (1992), these
criticisms of representativeness arise from a failure to appreciate the
difference between the approaches of molecular biologists who attend to
similarities and evolutionary biologists who attend to differences
within the species: &ldquo;The human genome project &hellip; is
directed toward a molecular biologist's view of a species rather
than a population biologist's view. The latter views a species as
the envelope of all possible variants that can breed together; the
importance of that envelope is that different aspects of a species
population will be drawn forth if you change the environment. Molecular
biologists generally view the species as a single entity, sharply
defined by a set of genes and a set of functions that makes up that
entity&rdquo; (p. 84). Gilbert held that the two approaches are
consistent with each other, but many evolutionist critics of the
HGP&mdash;both scientists and philosophers&mdash;did not, deriding the
aims of mapping and sequencing the human genome as a throwback to
anti-evolutionary, preDarwinian, typological, and
essentialist
 thinking.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#16" name="note-16">16</a>]</sup>
The
functional approach of molecular biologists alluded to by Gilbert is
said to represent genetic variation in improperly normative ways,
whereas &ldquo;in evolutionary biology, variation is not the same as
deviation&rdquo; (Hull 1994, p. 208). When molecular geneticists view
mutations as abnormal, not in the sense that they are rare or a change
in form, but as &ldquo;errors&rdquo; in the genetic code or
&ldquo;damage&rdquo; to the genome's proper structure, they
impose an arbitrary a priori categorization: &ldquo;it is genetic
&lsquo;errors&rsquo; that made us as a biological species: we humans
are integrated aggregates of such &lsquo;errors.&rsquo; Genetic
variation is the source of evolution; it is the reason why there could
be primates and not just protists or their precursors&rdquo; (Limoges
1994, p. 124).</p>

<p>

There are related worries that the human genome reference sequence
will arbitrate a standard of genetic normality; for example, the
application of concepts like &ldquo;genetic error&rdquo; and
&ldquo;damage&rdquo; to the genome institutes a call for correction or
repair (Limoges 1994; also Murphy 1994). McKusick (1989) has defended
the HGP's approach as &ldquo;consistent with that of most
biological research which depends on a few, and even on single
individuals, to represent the whole, and with the fact, recognized by
geneticists, that there is no single normal, ideal, or perfect
genome&rdquo; (p. 913). However, the normal-abnormal distinction is
fundamental to the structure-function studies of proximate fields of
biology like physiology and molecular genetics, and while McKusick is
no doubt correct to say that geneticists accept that there is no single
normal, ideal, or perfect genome, this does not mean that individual
DNA sequences are not constituted as normal or abnormal based on their
functional significance or that entire genomes are not deemed to fall
inside or outside of an acceptable range. Indeed, the 1988 OTA report
on the HGP recommends the &ldquo;eugenic use of genetic information
&hellip; to ensure &hellip; that each individual has at least a modicum
of normal genes&rdquo; (p. 85). It is little wonder that many worry
that as an increasing number of mutations are identified and tested
for, the range of what is considered normal may narrow, with diminished
tolerance for those people who lie outside this range. And there can be
no reassurance that judgments of health and disease, normality and
abnormality, manage to escape normativity by being transported to the
level of the genome; instead, they carry with them any social values
and cultural biases that are implicated at the higher level. Says
critic Ruth Hubbard (in Holloway 1995, p. 50): &ldquo;I have gone out
on a limb by saying that most people in our culture are very judgmental
about women who terminate a pregnancy because of sex. How different is
that from terminating a pregnancy because of Down syndrome?&rdquo;</p>

<p>

With the HGP reference sequence available as a basis for comparison,
attention has shifted to the genetic variation within the species that
evolutionist critics accused the project at the outset of ignoring.
Humans have been found to be 99.9 percent alike, with common sequence
variants occurring every 1000 bases. There is interest in identifying
the sites of the genome where variation occurs, the frequency of these
differences, and their significance. The social significance attaching
to such research was foreseen during the early years of the project.
Scientist David Baltimore predicted that the HGP would reveal that the
belief that &ldquo;we are all equal, all the same&rdquo; is a myth:
&ldquo;We are going to have to come to terms with the fact that we are
all born with different talents and tendencies&rdquo; (in Cooper 1994,
p. 320). Similarly, philosopher Marc Lapp&eacute; (1994) raised the
possibility that the HGP could reveal group differences&mdash;with
sequences localized to particular groups or varying in frequency among
groups&mdash;and that any such differences in the genetic lottery would
raise significant ethical implications for health care and
social
 policy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#17" name="note-17">17</a>]</sup>
But
the conceptualization of this variation also presents
challenges&mdash;for example, in distinguishing between normal and
abnormal genetic variation (Gannett 2003a), or drawing population
boundaries in the constitution of individual versus group differences
(Gannett 2003b). Pharmaceuticals are the most powerful engine driving
post-HGP diversity research, and though &ldquo;personalized
medicine&rdquo; was touted as a benefit of the HGP, en route, a detour
via the study of group genetic differences has been taken. For example,
the International HapMap Project, in order to compile a map adequately
dense with SNP markers to permit the identification of genes implicated
in common diseases and drug responses, sampled the DNA of four
populations (European-Americans in Utah, Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria,
Japanese in Tokyo, and Han Chinese in
 Beijing).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#18" name="note-18">18</a>]</sup>
Likely due to lessons learned
from the difficulties experienced by the Human Genome Diversity Project
(see Reardon 2004), attempts were made to involve representatives of
these groups in the planning of research through &ldquo;community
engagement&rdquo; and &ldquo;community consultation.&rdquo; These
efforts raise conceptual questions not only about the relations between
what are ostensibly distinct social and biological groups (Gannett
2003b, Juengst 1998), but what makes a &ldquo;community&rdquo; (Davis
2000). Now that &ldquo;group&rdquo; genetic differences have become of
interest to more than just evolutionary biologists and population
geneticists, impetus is provided to longstanding debates about whether
race is biologically real or socially constructed and more recent ones
concerning the appropriateness of the use of racial categories in
biomedical research (Gannett 2005; Root 2003).</p>

<h4>2.1.3 Essentialism and genetic reductionism</h4>

<p>

Various HGP proponents told us that we would discover &ldquo;our
human essence&rdquo; in the genome. According to Dulbecco (1986),
&ldquo;the sequence of the human DNA is the reality of our
species&rdquo; (p. 1056); Gilbert is quoted as saying &ldquo;sequencing
the human genome is like pursuing the holy grail&rdquo; (in Lee 1991,
p. 9); on the topic of his decision to dedicate three percent of HGP
funds to ELSI, Watson writes: &ldquo;The Human Genome Project is much
more than a vast roll call of As, Ts, Gs, and Cs: it is as precious a
body of knowledge as humankind will ever acquire, with a potential to
speak to our most basic philosophical questions about human nature, for
purposes of good and mischief alike&rdquo; (with Berry 2003, p.
172).</p>

<p>

There are theological worries about a genetic reductionism that
suggests that we are no more than our smallest material parts&mdash;the
bits of DNA that make up the genome. For example, Leon Kass, chairman
of the President's Council on Bioethics from 2001 to 2005,
decries, with arrival of &ldquo;the age of genetic technology,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the erosion, perhaps the final erosion, of the idea of man as
noble, dignified, precious or godlike, and its replacement with a view
of man, no less than of nature, as mere raw material for manipulation
and homogenization&rdquo; (2002, p. 138). Collins, an evangelical
Christian, doesn&rsquo;t share such worries; he is quoted in the
<em>Los Angeles Times</em> as saying: &ldquo;God is not threatened by
all this. I think God thinks it's wonderful that we puny creatures
are going about the business of trying to understand how our
instruction book works, because it's a very elegant instruction
book indeed&rdquo; (Gosselin 2000). Of course, this particular
religious world view is countered by an evolutionist one held by other
scientists. Gilbert's &ldquo;holy grail&rdquo; is not so holy
after all; he believes that the HGP reveals our place amidst the
interconnectedness of all life forms: &ldquo;The data base of the human
genome, coupled with our knowledge of the genetic makeup of model
organisms, promises to reveal patterns of genes and to show us how we
ourselves are embedded in the sweep of evolution that created our
world&rdquo; (1992, p. 97).</p>

<p>

A more secular philosophical concern about essentialism is tied to
longstanding debates in philosophy of biology about species (see
Erefshefsky 1992). Gilbert (1992) foresaw from the HGP a DNA-based
definition of <em>Homo sapiens</em>: &ldquo;At the end of the genome
project, we will want to be able to identify all the genes that make up
a human being. For example, we will compare the sequences of the human
and the mouse and be able to determine the genes that define a mammal
by this comparison&hellip;. So by comparing a human to a primate, we
will be able to identify the genes that encode the features of primates
and distinguish them from other mammals. Then, by tweaking our computer
programs, we will finally identify the regions of DNA that differ
between the primate and the human&mdash;and understand those genes that
make us uniquely human&rdquo; (p. 94). While it is true that any
stretch of DNA that belongs to all and only humans would be among those
differences found by comparing a single human genome sequence to a
single nonhuman primate or mouse genome sequence, any &ldquo;uniquely
human&rdquo; differences could not be distinguished from the others
without extensive infra- and inter-specific population studies which
are not part of the HGP. Even if such population studies were carried
out, Gilbert's assumptions about species essentialism&mdash;that
species can be defined or represented by properties (in this case,
certain stretches of DNA) universally shared among, and particular to,
their members&mdash;have long been challenged by philosophers of
biology (Gannett 2003a; Robert and Baylis 2003). Because evolution is a
gradual process where species are constantly undergoing change,
Aristotelian (essentialist) definitions of species need to be
abandoned; from an evolutionary perspective, in David Hull's
(1994) words: &ldquo;The essence of a particular species is to have no
essence&rdquo; (p. 215). Species should instead be defined as cluster
concepts (Hull 1965) or recognized to be individuals (i.e.
spatio-temporally restricted, historically contingent particulars) to
which organisms belong as parts, and not classes, sets, or natural
kinds at all (Ghiselin 1974; Hull 1978). </p>

<p>

Besides these attempts to reduce species to beanbags of genes,
genetic reductionism enters in attempts to explain cellular or
organismal properties solely in terms of genes, or entire organisms in
terms of genomes. Gilbert (1992) endorses an essentialism of this sort
as well: &ldquo;The information carried on the DNA, that genetic
information passed down from our parents,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;is
the most fundamental property of the body&rdquo; (p. 83), so much so,
in fact, that &ldquo;one will be able to pull a CD out of one's
pocket and say, &lsquo;Here is a human being; it's
me!&rsquo;&rdquo; (p. 96). The social prevalence of this representation
of the genome as the &ldquo;most fundamental&rdquo; aspect of the
individual means that genetic information has a particularly acute
impact on self-identity and self-understanding (Quaid 1994). Another
genome scientist Eric Lander (1996) characterizes the HGP as &ldquo;the
20<sup>th</sup> century's version of the discovery and
consolidation of the periodic table&rdquo; with the genes
&ldquo;elements&rdquo; and gene variants responsible for disease
susceptibilities &ldquo;isotopes&rdquo; (pp. 536&ndash;537). The probable
social consequence of this beanbag conception of the organism, combined
with a concept of genetic disease that relocates the locus of disease
from organism to genome, is the direction of technological fixes at the
genome (Keller 1994). When these technological fixes include prenatal
genetic screening and the possible modification of IVF embryos, it is
suggested that genetic reductionism contributes to the commodification
of children by making them an instrument of parental desire (Darnovsky
2001). The relevant notion of &ldquo;reduction&rdquo; at play here is
the explanation of wholes in terms of parts. As Sahotra Sarkar (1998)
notes, it is important to distinguish between genetic reductionism and
physical reductionism: &ldquo;From the point of view of physical
reductionism, DNA enters the molecular milieu on par with proteins or,
for that matter, lipids or any other molecules that are found in living
organisms. Physical reductionism does not require any assumption about
the primacy of DNA or of genes in the explanation of biological
behavior&rdquo; (p. 174). The reduction of organisms to their genomes
by molecular geneticists takes yet further molecular
biology's&mdash;and, more generally, proximate
biology's&mdash;reduction of organisms to their constituent
physical parts in a way that effaces the contexts (provided by
populations and environments) in which organisms develop (Griesemer
1994). Definitions of health and disease attach to organisms and their
physiological processes in particular environments and cannot simply be
relocated to the level of the genome (Limoges 1994; Lloyd 1994). It is
wrong to presume that diseases become more objectively defined entities
once they receive a genetic basis since social and cultural values
implicated in designations of health and disease can merely become
incorporated at the level of the genome, in what counts as a normal or
mutant gene.</p>

<p>

There is an additional sense in which genetic reductionism is
implicated in the HGP, and Gilbert makes reference to this as well.
This is the sense, familiar to philosophers of science, of
intertheoretic reduction, whereby (usually) higher-level theories are
said to be reduced by lower-level ones insofar as these lower-level
theories explain/predict the phenomena of the higher level. Gilbert
(1992) foresaw that the HGP would furnish the basis for a
&ldquo;theoretical biology&rdquo; in which from the genome's DNA
sequence it would be possible to predict protein sequence, and from
protein sequence it would be possible to predict three-dimensional
protein structure&mdash;either from &ldquo;first principles&rdquo;
based on energy calculations or from observed structural similarities
of the building blocks&mdash;and from there make predictions about
function, a predictability that Gilbert suggests would extend to
individual organisms and their behavior, and might therefore be
difficult to accept: &ldquo;To recognize that we are determined, in a
certain sense, by a finite collection of information that is knowable
will change our view of ourselves&rdquo; (p. 96). Gilbert seems to
conflate epistemology with ontology, moving from genetic reductionism
where genes suffice to predict or explain behavior to genetic
determinism where genes are sufficient causes of behavior (see next
section), but more importantly, even at the lowest level of
organization, his vision faces formidable obstacles. Notwithstanding
the protein folding problem and the need to consider gene regulation in
order to proceed beyond the level of protein structure, there are
significant difficulties in attempting even to predict the linear
structure of proteins from sequence data alone: specifically, abilities
are limited for recognizing transcription initiation sites and, in the
presence of extensive RNA editing, the boundaries between introns and
exons and coding and noncoding segments of DNA (Sarkar
 1998).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#19" name="note-19">19</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Molecular biology's technological capacity to manipulate the
human genome brings society into something of an existentialist
predicament. Science has tended to conceive human essence as a fixed
object discoverable in nature. But a human essence embedded in
manipulable genome is not immutable&mdash;it is created, not
discovered. There is a very real sense in which in making the difficult
choices we face&mdash;for example, those involved in prenatal genetic
testing and germ-line manipulation&mdash;we really are
choosing
 ourselves.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#20" name="note-20">20</a>]</sup></p>

<h4>2.1.4 Genetic determinism and the nature-nurture controversy</h4>

<p>

Gilbert's reductionist vision of the sequenced human genome as
&ldquo;the grail&rdquo; upon which a &ldquo;theoretical biology&rdquo;
can be founded brings to the fore philosophical questions about genetic
determinism. One might ask with Richard Lewontin (2000 [1992], p. 139),
however rhetorically: &ldquo;How is it that a mere molecule [DNA] can
have the power of both self-reproduction and self-action, being the
cause of itself and the cause of all other things?&rdquo; Getting
straight on genetic determinism is important. There is a long, ignoble
history of marshalling ideological justification for unjust and
oppressive social and political institutions and structures by
appealing to the ostensibly scientific assertion that &ldquo;human
nature is fixed by our genes&rdquo; (Rose et al. 1984; also
Lewontin
 1993).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#21" name="note-21">21</a>]</sup>
Critics of the HGP saw it as placing &ldquo;the seal of approval from
mainstream science&rdquo; on hereditarianism, favoring nature over
nurture like the eugenics of the early to mid-20<sup>th</sup> century,
to promote a &ldquo;technological fix&rdquo; for social problems (Allen
1994, p.
 164).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#22" name="note-22">22</a>]</sup>
However, with the HGP nearing completion and
the availability of entire genome sequences for numerous organisms
supporting the movement from structural to functional genomics,
Keller&mdash;one such early critic&mdash;found that the deterministic
and reductionistic assumptions underlying the HGP had actually been
undermined by the research in molecular biology the HGP made possible:
&ldquo;What is most impressive to me is not so much the ways in which
the genome project has fulfilled our expectations but the ways in which
it has transformed them&hellip;. Contrary to all expectations, instead
of lending support to the familiar notions of genetic determinism that
have acquired so powerful grip on the popular imagination, these
successes pose critical challenges to such notions&rdquo; (2000, p.
5).</p>

<p>

Yet, DNA is still portrayed as fundamental: in a public lecture held
in celebration of the completion of the HGP, Collins characterized the
HGP as &ldquo;an amazing adventure into ourselves, to understand our
own DNA instruction book, the shared inheritance of
all
 humankind.&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#23" name="note-23">23</a>]</sup>
While virtually all biologists disavow
genetic determinism today, it is not always so clear what exactly they
are denying. Jonathan Kaplan (2000) identifies three different ways in
which claims about genetic determinism might be understood: (i) as
&ldquo;complete information&rdquo; where everything about us is viewed
as predictable based on our genes; (ii) as &ldquo;intervention is
useless&rdquo; where traits are said to be impervious to environmental
changes; and (iii) as traits that are in some sense primarily, even if
not wholly, genetic. Kaplan argues that when biologists disavow genetic
determinism it is (ii) they have in mind (with
phenylketonuria&mdash;PKU&mdash;frequently used as an
 example).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#24" name="note-24">24</a>]</sup>
According to
Kaplan, (i) is easily seen to be &ldquo;trivially false,&rdquo; and
therefore not worth disavowing&mdash;yet, this resembles Laplacian
determinism's concern with predictability, and as we have seen,
Gilbert seems to be making such a claim. Despite their disavowals of
genetic determinism, Kaplan finds that biologists often adhere to
(iii); however, the basis for the primacy of genes remains to be
understood. Questions about genetic determinism and Collins&rsquo;
representation of the sequenced human genome as &ldquo;our own DNA
instruction book&rdquo;&mdash;which suggests an asymmetry between
genetic and nongenetic causes&mdash;need to be approached at several
different levels: cellular, organismal, and
 societal.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#25" name="note-25">25</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

At the cellular level, the book is said to contain &ldquo;the
genetic instructions for the entire repertoire of cellular
components&rdquo; (Collins et al. 2003, p. 3). This genetic determinism
at the cellular level is sustained by metaphors of Weismannism and DNA
as &ldquo;code&rdquo; or &ldquo;master molecule&rdquo; (Griesemer 1994;
Keller 1994). DNA is accorded causal priority over other cellular
components in a couple of ways. One way is to treat DNA as temporally
prior. This may be in a physical sense: Weismannism assumes that
intergenerational continuity exists only for germ cell nuclei whereas
somatic cells and germ cell cytoplasm arise anew in each generation. It
may also be in the sense of a point of origin for the transfer of
information: the central dogma of molecular biology, which represents a
1950s reformulation of Weismannism in terms of information theory,
asserts that information travels unidirectionally from nucleic acids to
protein, and never vice versa. The chief difficulty for these claims of
temporal priority is of the chicken-and-egg variety: nucleic acids need
proteins and other cellular components to make proteins (Smith 1992).
Although it is fully accepted that the fertilized ovum contains the
cytoplasmic contribution of at least the maternal germ cell, there
persists a tendency in developmental genetics to focus on cytoplasmic
(mitochondrial) DNA and to ignore the role of cytoplasmic proteins. It
is also contentious whether amongst the cell's components only
nucleic acids can be said to transmit information: for some
philosophers, genetic coding plays a theoretical role at least at this
cellular level (Godfrey-Smith 2000); for others, genetic coding is
merely (and misleadingly) metaphorical, and all cellular components are
potential bearers of information (Griffiths 2001; Griffiths and Gray
1994; Sarkar 1996). An additional way in which DNA is accorded causal
priority lies in its treatment as ontologically prior: this is
exemplified in Watson's description of DNA as &ldquo;the most
golden of molecules&rdquo; (in Bodmer and McKie 1994, p. 10). Causal
asymmetry provides a possible reason for privileging DNA on an
ontological basis: provided all cellular components necessary for
protein synthesis are present, modification of the DNA sequence may be
followed by a predictable and specifiable change in protein sequence,
but the opposite will not occur. This difference could be conceived in
terms of the Aristotelian distinction between formal and efficient
causation and the accompanying metaphysical preferences for form over
matter and mind over body that are deeply embedded in western
philosophy. Keller (2000) describes how, in the discourse of
&ldquo;gene action&rdquo; which arose between the mid-1920s and 1960s
and culminated in Francis Crick's &ldquo;central dogma,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the gene was bestowed with the properties of materiality,
agency, life, and mind&rdquo; and rendered &ldquo;[p]art
physicist's atom and part Platonic soul&rdquo; (p.
 47).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#26" name="note-26">26</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

At the level of the organism, talk of genetic coding and the
asymmetry between genetic and nongenetic causes such talk conveys, even
when countenanced at the cellular level, are deemed less acceptable
(Godfrey-Smith 2000). New research in functional genomics may well lead
to less deterministic accounts even of so-called single gene disorders.
For these, the concepts of penetrance and expressivity operate in ways
which accommodate the one-one genetic determinist model where the
mutation is necessary and/or sufficient for both the presence of the
condition and confounding patterns of phenotypic variability. But the
severity of even a fully penetrant condition like Huntington's
disease seems to depend on not just genetic factors like the number of
DNA repeats in the mutation but epigenetic factors like the sex of the
parent who transmitted the mutation (Ridley et al. 1991).</p>

<p>

At the level of individuals in society, when we consider complex
conditions to which both genetic and environmental differences
contribute&mdash;for example, psychiatric disorders or behavioral
differences&mdash;gene-centrism persists. The April 1998 cover of
<em>Life</em> captures the reader's attention: &ldquo;WERE YOU
<strong>BORN</strong> THAT WAY? Personality, temperament, even life choices. New studies
show it's mostly in your genes.&rdquo; Leading scientists have
said similar things. At the outset of the HGP, Watson told us:
&ldquo;we used to think our fate is in our stars. Now we know, in large
measure, our fate is in our genes&rdquo; (in Jaroff 1989). Post-HGP,
Watson seems unaffected by the changes that have so impressed Keller.
While he introduces the recent book <em>Behavioral Genetics in the
Postgenomic Era</em> by stating confidently that &ldquo;with the
arrival of the human DNA genome sequence and its attendant list of
human genes, the experimental procedures will soon be on hand to
finally settle the long contentious nature-nurture arguments&rdquo; (p.
xxii), the question seems already settled for him in his assertions
that &ldquo;children come into the world with fixed
personalities&rdquo; and &ldquo;effective remedies for socially
inappropriate behaviors&rdquo; will best be carried out at the
molecular level (in Plomin et al. 2003, p. xxii).</p>

<p>

But notice the waffle words used by Watson and on the cover of
<em>Life</em>: &ldquo;in large measure&rdquo; and &ldquo;mostly in your
genes.&rdquo; Everyone is an interactionist these days, in some sense
of &ldquo;interaction.&rdquo; Genes and environment, or nature and
nurture, are recognized both to be necessary for development: by
themselves, genes can&rsquo;t determine or do anything. Yet, theorists
still seem to give the nod to one or the other, suggesting that it is
mostly genes or mostly the environment, mostly nature or mostly
nurture, that make us what we are. This implies that it is possible to
apportion the relative contributions of each. Gilbert (1992) suggests
this in his dismissal of a more simplistic version of genetic
determinism: &ldquo;We must see beyond a first reaction that we are the
consequences of our genes; that we are guilty of a crime because our
genes made us do it; or that we are noble because our genes made us so.
This shallow genetic determinism is unwise and untrue. But society will
have to wrestle with the questions of how much of our makeup is
dictated by the environment, how much is dictated by our genetics, and
how much is dictated by our own will and determination&rdquo; (pp.
96&ndash;97). However, the assertion that the relative contributions of genes
and environment, nature and nurture, can be apportioned in this way is
misleading if not outright false. As Lewontin argued in his classic
paper on heritability, it is impossible to infer causal relations from
the analysis of variance. The only legitimate exception is where there
is &ldquo;perfect or nearly perfect additivity between genotypic and
environmental effects so that the differences among genotypes are the
same in all environments and the differences between environments are
the same for all genotypes&rdquo; (1974, p.
 408).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#27" name="note-27">27</a>]</sup>
Contrary to Watson's
assertion, the replacement of quantitative with molecular genetic
techniques cannot resolve the nature-nurture controversy because of the
same problem that affects heritability measures: the context-dependence
of genes as causes given the nonadditivity of gene-gene and
gene-environment interactions. Recent work in developmental systems
theory (DST) which undermines any such attempts to apportion causal
responsibility in organismal development makes clear why: traits are
jointly determined by multiple causes, each context-sensitive and
contingent (Griffiths and Gray 1994; Griffiths and Knight 1998; Oyama
1985; Oyama et al. 2001; Robert
 2004).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#28" name="note-28">28</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

When genetics enter philosophical debates about freedom and
determinism, questions about moral and legal responsibility are
central: if the genes a person happens to inherit can be said in some
sense to determine her actions, is it legitimate to praise, blame,
reward, or punish that person? Retributivism pulls in opposing
directions: genetic predisposition to violent or criminal acts may
suggest &ldquo;a volitional disability that makes blame
inappropriate&rdquo; or &ldquo;a permanence that invites blame&rdquo;
(Wasserman 2001, p. 304). The HGP is unlikely to enlighten or
complicate these longstanding debates, however (Baron 2001). The thesis
of universal causation (no uncaused events) and its implications for
freedom are unaffected by genetics: it makes no sense to claim that all
events have genetic causes, and were it to turn out that certain
events&mdash;i.e. human behaviors or actions&mdash;have genetic causes,
these pose no different a threat for freedom than their nongenetic
counterparts. In addition, genetic causes of behavior are likely to be
tendencies or predispositions which do not necessitate their effects:
for incompatibilists, genetic and nongenetic causes are jointly
responsible for behaviors, and genetic determinism adds nothing to the
challenge determinism already poses for freedom; for compatibilists,
since a person's behavioral genetic tendencies or predispositions
do not compel her to act in a certain way, they are no different than
nongenetic (biological or environmental) tendencies or predispositions
not of a person's own making. Of course, the general
public&mdash;in voting booths, on juries, etc.&mdash;may be swayed more
by genetic explanations given beliefs in genetic determinism fuelled by
media reports of apparent discoveries of genes for this or that
behavior.</p>

<h4>2.1.5 Genetic explanations</h4>

<p>

The gene is a &ldquo;cultural icon&rdquo;: in popular culture, from
movies to cartoons to Dear Abby, quite apart from its biological and
medical contexts, the gene has become &ldquo;a symbol, a metaphor, a
convenient way to define personhood, identity, and relationships in
socially meaningful ways&rdquo; (Nelkin and Lindee 1995, p. 16). Hardly
a week goes by when we do not hear about a newly discovered gene for
one thing or another. &ldquo;Geneticization&rdquo; is a term used to
describe this phenomenon marked by an increasing tendency to reduce
human differences to genetic ones (Lippman
 1991).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#29" name="note-29">29</a>]</sup>
This tendency is accompanied
by worries of critics that embracing a reductionist approach to
medicine that conceives of human health and disease in wholly molecular
or genetic terms individualizes these and detracts attention from our
shared social and physical environments and the role of toxins, fast
food, poverty, lack of access to health care, etc. (Nelkin and Tancredi
1989; Hubbard and Wald 1993). One of the justifications for spending
several billion dollars on human genome research is the belief that
genes are key determinants of not only rare Mendelian diseases like
Huntington's disease or cystic fibrosis but common
multi-factorial conditions like cancer, depression, and heart disease.
In Watson's words: &ldquo;Some call New Jersey the Cancer State
because of all the chemical companies there, but in fact, the major
factor is probably your genetic constitution&rdquo; (in Cooper 1994, p.
326). </p>

<p>

Writes an early critic of the HGP: &ldquo;Without question, it was
the technical prowess that molecular biology had achieved by the early
1980s that made it possible even to imagine a task as formidable as
that of sequencing what has come to be called &lsquo;the human
genome.&rsquo; But it was the concept of genetic disease that created
the climate in which such a project could appear both reasonable and
desirable&rdquo; (Keller 1992, p. 293). Given that the development of
any trait involves the interaction of both genetic and nongenetic
factors, on what bases can genes be privileged as causes in order to
claim that a particular disease or nondisease trait is
&ldquo;genetic&rdquo; or caused by a &ldquo;genetic
susceptibility&rdquo; or &ldquo;genetic predisposition&rdquo;? Does it
make sense for HGP proponents like Bodmer to characterize even
smoking-induced forms of cancer as genetic? &ldquo;Cancer, scientists
have discovered, is a genetic condition in which cells spread
uncontrollably, and cigarette smoke contains chemicals which stimulate
those molecular changes&rdquo; (Bodmer and McKie 1994, p.
 89).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#30" name="note-30">30</a>]</sup>
From the
outset, we need to distinguish between genes conceived as causes of a
trait's appearance in a given individual (&ldquo;<em>x</em> is a
<em>gene for</em> trait <em>y</em> in organism <em>z</em>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;My three-pack-a-day Aunt Viv must have the gene that causes
cancer&rdquo;) and genes as causes of differences in traits among
individuals (&ldquo;<em>x</em> is a <em>gene for</em> trait <em>y</em>
in population <em>z</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;Lots of people in my family
smoke, but only Aunt Viv and Cousin Sal seem to have inherited the gene
for
 cancer&rdquo;).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#31" name="note-31">31</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

The logical interrelatedness of cause and effect&mdash;that is,
whether a condition is necessary and/or sufficient for a given event to
occur&mdash;is the approach taken to defining what makes a condition
&ldquo;genetic&rdquo; in individuals. A strong sense of &ldquo;genetic
disease&rdquo; is recognized when the genetic factor is both necessary
and sufficient for the disease to arise &ldquo;regardless of
environment&rdquo; (Wulff 1984), or when the genetic factor is
sufficient for the disease to present &ldquo;in all known
environments&rdquo; (Kitcher 1996)&mdash;this latter definition
recognizes that, in some cases, a disease may have nongenetic as well
as genetic origins (since the genetic factor is sufficient but not
necessary). &ldquo;Genetic susceptibility&rdquo; is defined as an
increased probability of disease in all known (strong sense) or some
(weak sense) environments (Kitcher 1996). Note that <em>ceteris
paribus</em> clauses referring to an assumed background of necessary,
though not sufficient, genetic and environment factors are required by
these definitions. Just as striking a match causes it to ignite only if
it is dry and in the presence of oxygen, as we saw in the previous
section, genes don&rsquo;t do anything alone. This is the first of
three ways in which genetic explanations are
context-dependent.</p>

<p>

Adopting a population-based approach to genetic causation, where
differences in genes are understood to explain differences in traits
and not traits themselves, replaces the need for <em>ceteris
paribus</em> clauses because they rely on the actual distribution of
the necessary genetic and nongenetic background factors in specific
populations. The case can be made that the first approach is indebted
to the second, and that one never explains a property of an object
<em>tout court</em> but only in relation to a reference class of an
object or objects that lack the property (but share the necessary
background factors). Writes Germund Hesslow (1983), &ldquo;all
explanations of individual facts of the form <em>Fa</em>&mdash;that is,
where an object <em>a</em> has a certain property
<em>F</em>&mdash;involve a comparison with other objects which lack the
property in question&rdquo; (p. 91). No trait can be labeled
&ldquo;genetic&rdquo; in any absolute sense, but only relative to a
specific population. For example, lactose intolerance is considered to
be a genetic condition in northern European populations where ingestion
of milk products is common and lactase deficiency rare, whereas in
African populations, where ingestion of milk products is rare and
lactase deficiency common, it is considered to be an environmental
condition (Hesslow 1984). This is the second way in which genetic
explanations are
 context-dependent.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#32" name="note-32">32</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

The third, and final, way in which genetic explanations are
context-dependent is that they are a function of the present state of
knowledge. Huntington's disease is deemed a genetic condition on
both the individual and population accounts: a single mutant gene is
necessary, and arguably sufficient given necessary (and standard)
background conditions, for symptoms to appear in a given person; the
presence and absence of disease symptoms in members of the population
is accounted for in terms of the presence and absence of the mutation.
This is nevertheless an epistemically relative claim. Once the relevant
gene is mapped and sequenced, the mechanisms by which genetic and
nongenetic factors interact to produce symptoms of the disease remain
to be understood. Such causal knowledge is often obtained through the
experimental manipulation of conditions beyond &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
limits, and what conditions are exploited as possible causes in the
laboratory and what conditions are kept constant as necessary
background, along with pragmatic decisions about how research efforts
should be expended more generally, are influenced by clinical and
social, as well as scientific, contexts (Gannett
 1999).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#33" name="note-33">33</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Behind philosophical attempts to seek objective, nonevaluative
foundations for designations of diseases as &ldquo;genetic&rdquo; or
&ldquo;environmental&rdquo; lie positivist assumptions that theoretical
understanding furnishes the basis for rational action. One concern with
geneticization and the trend to label an increasing number of diseases
and conditions &ldquo;genetic&rdquo; is that this provides normative
support for directing future research and therapeutic interventions in
particular ways, that is, at the level of the genome (Cranor 1994).
Watson's (1992) colorful metaphor makes this normative support
explicit: &ldquo;Ignoring genes is like trying to solve a murder
without finding the murderer. All we have are victims&rdquo; (p. 167).
But this is fallacious reasoning, as the context-dependence of genetic
explanations shows. We might instead understand geneticization to be
the consequence of an increased capacity to manipulate DNA in the
laboratory and (potentially) the clinic and not an advancement in
theoretical understanding. Genetic explanations, on such a view, are
pragmatic: there is a practical context in which genes are singled out
as causes not only because they are amenable to technological control
but because they are increasingly perceived to be more tractable than
their nongenetic counterparts and therefore the best means to a variety
of ends (Gannett 1999).</p>

<h4>2.1.6 Model organisms</h4>

<p>

Many of the model organisms chosen for the HGP had already enjoyed
illustrious careers in the history of genetics: the fruitfly <em>D.
melanogaster</em> was the organism that started it all in T. H.
Morgan's lab at Columbia University in the 1910s, ushering in the
era known today as classical genetics; with discoveries of spontaneous
mutation and recombination in the 1940s, the bacterium <em>E. coli</em>
helped to take genetics molecular, serving also as host for the phage
studied by Max Delbr&uuml;ck's group; the nematode worm <em>C.
elegans</em> was Sydney Brenner's choice to model the development
of the nervous system in the mid-1960s at Cambridge
 University.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#34" name="note-34">34</a>]</sup>
It was, in
fact, these histories that recommended them: &ldquo;the experimental
organisms that became &lsquo;model organisms&rsquo; were not selected
and constructed mainly on the basis of principles of universality or
even typicality of their biological characteristics and processes,
though it was hoped that many features would prove to be shared or
common to other organisms, particularly humans. Instead they were
primarily chosen for ease of experimental tractability and due to the
availability of some background information on basic genetic
composition and relation to phenotype&rdquo; (Ankeny 2001, pp.
S253-S254). </p>

<p>

Philosophical questions arise about the senses in which these
various organisms serve as &ldquo;models.&rdquo; Potentially, models
may embody a range of characteristics: as typical or representative; as
ideal or perfect; as convenient, tractable, or manipulable; as
homologous (conserved evolutionarily); as analogous; as exemplars; as
abstractions. Models may also be used in a variety of ways: to model
disease processes; to model normal processes; as structural models; as
type organisms representative of the species or higher phylogenetic
level; as heuristic tools; as mathematical
 devices.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#35" name="note-35">35</a>]</sup>
In a recent article examining
researchers&rsquo; use of the flowering plant <em>Arabidopsis
thaliana</em> as a model organism, Sabina Leonelli (2008) points out
that models can be abstract (vs. concrete) in different ways:
absolutely, in terms of their sense perceptibility; or relatively, in
terms of their physical meaning with respect to the phenomena
represented or the range of phenomena they are taken to represent. She
then shifts the philosophical focus from models themselves to modeling
practices: abstraction, for example, becomes a component of the
activity of producing a model rather than solely an attribute of the
model. This approach emphasizes the need to attend not just to the
relationship between model and phenomenon modeled but the material,
social, and institutional settings and varied commitments of
researchers. </p>

<p>

Rachel Ankeny (2000, 2001) considers several ways in which organisms
might plausibly be considered models. She suggests that mapped and
sequenced genomes for these various HGP model organisms serve as
&ldquo;descriptive models.&rdquo; A genome reference sequence is a
<em>model</em> because it is, first, &ldquo;an idealized, abstract
entity constructed from the natural organism&rdquo; and, second,
&ldquo;&lsquo;model&rsquo; is used to indicate a promissory note about
this organism providing a framework for pursuing explanatory questions
and ultimately serving as a prototype for understanding more complex
organisms&rdquo; (Ankeny 2000, p. S267). Genome reference sequences are
<em>descriptive</em> because they are &ldquo;constructed largely
without motivation by hypotheses to be tested or traditional
explanatory questions&rdquo; but rather as preliminary to such work
(Ankeny 2000, p. S267). In this, they are similar to earlier efforts to
use wiring diagrams for <em>C. elegans</em> to model neural structure:
these diagrams were based on data from several worms but were presented
as canonical; the worms were &ldquo;wild type&rdquo; and presumed to
exhibit species-typical structure; the diagrams served as a tool to
investigate abnormalities (Ankeny 2000). Nonhuman genome reference
sequences become tools as their corresponding organisms are used as
experimental models for understanding basic biological processes common
to many species or diseases processes found in humans&mdash;for
example, by knocking out genes in mice. Here, analogical reasoning is
at work; &ldquo;[m]odels in this sense of the term seem to provide what
might be termed strong causal analog models&rdquo; (Ankeny 2001, p.
S255). According to Kenneth Schaffner (1998a), this is quite typical of
biological explanation: unlike physicists, biologists frame
explanations &ldquo;around a few exemplar subsystems in specific
organisms &hellip; used as (interlevel) <em>prototypes</em> to organize
information about other similar (overlapping) models&rdquo; (p.
278).</p>

<p>

Monod famously once said that what is true of <em>E. coli</em> is
true of the elephant, but just as famously, this proved not at all to
be the case in moving from prokaryotic to eukaryotic gene regulation.
More recently, biologist Bruce Alberts writes: &ldquo;we can say with
confidence that the fastest and most efficient way of acquiring an
understanding of ourselves is to devote an enormous effort trying to
understand &hellip; relatively &lsquo;simple&rsquo; organisms&rdquo;
(in Schaffner 1998a, p. 277). What inspires such confidence when a
simple organism like <em>C. elegans</em> with its 302 neurons and
repertoire of behaviors (movement in response to touch and chemical
stimuli, egg laying, and mating) is used to model human behavior in all
its complexity? Most importantly, the model organism must be
representative of the systems being modeled: genomic sequences must be
similar in model and modeled organisms; there must be a known
cause-effect relationship between the model organism's genotype
and phenotype; there cannot be any &ldquo;causally relevant
disanalogies&rdquo; between model and modeled organisms, for example,
due to differences in complexity (Ankeny 2001, p. S257). Schaffner
(1998b) examines molecular geneticists&rsquo; use of <em>C.
elegans</em> as a behavioral model. Even in these simple organisms,
relations between genes, neurons, and behaviors are complex
(many-many), with one gene-one behavior associations rare exceptions
and their intervening causal chains yet to be understood. While such
complexity is to be expected in humans with their more complicated
nervous systems, Schaffner believes that there may be a small number of
single gene effects on behavior where these genes are highly homologous
and strongly conserved&mdash;hence, the usefulness of simple models
like <em>C. elegans</em> combined with others for investigating basic
mechanisms and psychiatric disorders.</p>

<p>

The model organism approach faces challenges, however. As Schaffner
recognizes, model organisms are also idealizations: organisms are
selected for features not generalizable even to close relatives like
rapid development, short generation time, small adult size, and
insensitivity to environmental variation (Wimsatt 1998); strains are
inbred to remove genetic diversity. Context-sensitivity diminishes
expectations that similar mechanisms operate in simple and complex
systems; multiple realizeability creates doubts that similar
explanations will be found across taxa (Wimsatt 1998). Evolution is a
branching process; as Richard Burian (1993) emphasizes: &ldquo;At
(virtually?) all levels of the biological world&mdash;including the
biochemical&mdash;it is an open question how general the findings
produced by the use of a particular organism are&rdquo; (p. 365).
Consequently, support for theoretical hypotheses requires the
experimental findings to be placed within a comparative and
evolutionary framework attentive to how widely the relevant nucleotide
sequences and traits are distributed phylogenetically: &ldquo;detailed
knowledge of (historical) biological contingencies constrains&mdash;and
ought to constrain&mdash;the evaluation of experimental work in biology
and the knowledge claims based on that work&rdquo; (Burian 1993,
p.
 366).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#36" name="note-36">36</a>]</sup></p>

<h3><a name="EthImpHumGenPro">2.2 Ethical Implications of the Human Genome Project</a></h3>

<h4>2.2.1 Gene patents</h4>

<p>

The policy of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) used to be
that life forms, as products of nature, were unpatentable. Only
products and processes invented by humans could be patented. But what
about genetically modified life forms: are they invented or discovered,
the product of nature or humans? In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court issued
its 5&ndash;4 decision in <em>Diamond v Chakrabarty</em> that a bacterial
strain that had been genetically modified to clean up oil spills could
be patented since it was &ldquo;man-made&rdquo; and not naturally
occurring. Since this ruling, &ldquo;the PTO has awarded thousands of
patents on biological products, including patents on genes, SNPs, ESTs,
cell lines, mice, plants, rhesus monkeys, and human stem cells&rdquo;
(Resnik 2004, p.
 54).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#37" name="note-37">37</a>]</sup>
Following <em>Diamond v Chakrabarty</em>,
genes and gene products are considered patentable in their
non-naturally-occurring forms, even if, unlike genetically modified
life forms, the sequence information they contain is unaltered from
what occurs
 naturally.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#38" name="note-38">38</a>]</sup>
Patents are granted on cloned genes because
they are isolated and purified versions of their naturally occurring
state; patents are granted on cDNAs because they are not found in
nature (without intervening introns) but produced using RNA molecules
and the enzyme reverse transcriptase; and patents are granted on
proteins, even if they occur naturally, when genetically engineered on
the basis of DNA or RNA sequence data. For such cases, DNA sequences
are treated by the PTO and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit as &ldquo;compositions of matter&rdquo; (the wording contained
in the patent statute) analogous to patentable chemical compounds
(Eisenberg
 2002).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#39" name="note-39">39</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Controversy about patenting genes was provoked over the course of
the HGP when researchers at the NIH and elsewhere applied for patents
on ESTs (expressed sequence tags) for cDNAs without having mapped and
sequenced the relevant genes, and without any knowledge of gene
function. Granting such patents means that subsequent researchers who
discover functions conducive to the development of diagnostic tests or
treatments are faced with paying licensing fees or royalties. For
example, in 1996, researchers discovered that the protein CCR5 plays a
role in HIV infection, but a patent on the gene for CCR5 had already
been applied for by the biotech company Human Genome Sciences having
postulated a possible anti-inflammatory role for the gene using
computational methods (Smaglik 2000). Many human genome scientists
opposed the policy of granting gene patents without knowledge of
function, whether for ESTs and cDNAs or complete gene sequences. Human Genome Organization (HUGO)
issued this 1995 statement: &ldquo;HUGO is worried that the patenting
of partial and uncharacterized cDNA sequences will reward those who
make routine discoveries but penalize those who determine biological
function or application. Such an outcome would impede that development
of diagnostics and therapeutics, which is clearly not in the
public
 interest.&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#40" name="note-40">40</a>]</sup>
In 2000, the NIH and scientific bodies like
the National Academy of Sciences and Royal Society of London called for
tighter rules to discourage patent applications on genes identified
merely by computational analysis of sequence data, the public release
of which the 1996 Bermuda Accord required of sequencing centers every
24 hours (Alberts and Klug 2000; Dickson 2000). That year, the PTO
revised its guidelines to require that researchers applying for patents
demonstrate utility (U.S. Department of Commerce
 2001).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#41" name="note-41">41</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Controversy has also arisen over whether the purposes of the
intellectual property system are being fulfilled in the case of gene
patents. Patents are supposed to work to stimulate scientific research
and technological development by removing the need for secrecy, and
this in turn is supposed to benefit society as a whole. Many believe
that secrecy has increased, that there is less sharing of data and
techniques between laboratories, and that research and development
efforts that build on initial discoveries are being stymied. When
researchers are issued a patent on a gene they have mapped and
sequenced, they may license exclusive rights to a biotech or
pharmaceutical company to develop and market applications&mdash;perhaps
a drug or diagnostic test. Research costs are driven up when scientists
who must test individuals in their studies are beset by royalty
payments. Without a competitive market, the costs of administering
diagnostic tests in the clinic also rise. For example, Myriad Genetics
patented BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast and ovarian cancer genes and granted
Eli Lilly exclusive rights to market applications based on the BRCA1
sequence. The cost for a woman at risk of developing cancer to be
tested for BRCA mutations was $2400-$3500, and researchers working to
understand how these mutations are implicated in the development of
cancer also had to pay the fee (Reynolds 2000). Of particular ethical
concern is that much of the research which results in patented
discoveries is funded by government or nonprofits. For example, the
BRCA research was federally funded: it was conducted by researchers at
the University of Utah (which assigned its rights to Myriad) who were
supported by NIH and at the National Institute of Environmental Health
Sciences (Reynolds 2000). This is an outcome of a U.S. governmental
policy that encourages federally-funded researchers to seek
partnerships with the private sector. So, as taxpayers and consumers,
the public ends up paying twice. These discoveries also could not have
been made without the cooperation of patients and their families, and
yet, while researchers and institutions profit, they are faced with
more expensive tests and treatments (see Merz et al. 2002 on
patenting's effects on the cost and availability of genetic tests
for hereditary haemochromatosis).</p>

<p>

Intellectual property rights also raise ethical questions about
conflict of interest and exploitation. Such potential exists in
research that studies relatively small, isolated populations to see if
there are any rare genes present which may be of value for
pharmaceutical development (Dickenson 2004; Salopek 1997). In one
well-known episode, organizations representing indigenous peoples
mounted opposition to a 1995 patent granted to the NIH on a cell line
obtained from a Hagahai man from Papua New Guinea, a claim later
withdrawn by the NIH due to the controversy. The patenting of human
genes and cell lines is seen as a continuation of the
&ldquo;bioprospecting&rdquo; and &ldquo;biopiracy&rdquo; that have
taken place over the past several decades with western corporations
securing patents on medicinal and food uses of plants which have been
long a part of traditional knowledge (Shiva 1996). Problems also arise
in clinical research. With multiple sources of conflict of interest
operating, there was the potential for exploitation when teenager Jesse
Gelsinger died in a gene therapy trial in 1999. Researcher James Wilson
held patents on several of the procedures used; Genovo, the private
firm sponsoring the study, was founded by Wilson; Wilson and his
employer, the University of Pennsylvania, held equity in Genovo; and
Genovo was providing $4 million per year to the university's
Human Gene Therapy Institute (Resnik 2004, p. 162).</p>

<p>

Philosophical arguments in support of gene patents include: patents
are just rewards for researchers&rsquo; efforts and costs; by mixing
their labor with what occurs naturally, researchers acquire property
rights in the Lockean sense; patents contribute to scientific and
technological progress by diminishing secrecy and providing incentives;
society ultimately benefits with better and more economical medical
treatments (Resnik 1997a). Philosophical arguments in opposition to
gene patents include: patents exert negative effects on scientific
research by promoting secrecy and impeding openness and sharing of data
and technologies among scientists, leading to publication delays,
inhibiting further research, and encouraging researchers to pursue
projects of short term, commercial benefit (Nelkin 2002); patents
operate as monopolies which compromise medical care by driving up the
costs of diagnostic tests and pharmaceuticals and creating financial
conflicts of interests which diminish trust between physicians and
patients (Nelkin 2002); patenting is an unacceptable and dehumanizing
commodification of life (Dickenson 2004); genes even if isolated and
purified remain products of nature and are therefore not patentable
(Sagoff 2002); the human genome is the &ldquo;common heritage of
humanity&rdquo; not private property (HUGO
 2000).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#42" name="note-42">42</a>]</sup></p>

<h4>2.2.2 Genetic testing</h4>

<p>

Early on the in the HGP, it was recognized that the development of
genetic tests would precede, perhaps by decades, the capacity to treat
the corresponding conditions successfully: this emphasized the
importance of confronting the ethical implications of genetic testing.
Genetic testing is carried out for a range of purposes: diagnostic,
predictive, and reproductive. Diagnostic genetic testing is performed
on individuals already experiencing signs and symptoms of disease.
Predictive genetic testing is performed on individuals who are at risk
for inheriting a familial condition but do not yet show any signs or
symptoms. Predictive testing is presently offered for a number of
conditions: these include Huntington's disease (HD), cystic
fibrosis (CF), sickle cell anemia, breast cancer, and colon cancer.
Although the HGP was defended by its proponents on the basis that the
knowledge of individual genome sequences would facilitate the movement
from a reactive to predictive medicine, there are no cures yet for most
diseases identified as having a genetic basis. For some conditions,
like familial hypercholesterolemia or polycystic kidney disease, early
intervention may lessen the severity of symptoms. Reproductive genetic
testing is carried out in several ways: through carrier screening,
prenatal testing of the fetus in utero, and preimplantation genetic
diagnosis (PGD) of embryos created by in vitro fertilization (IVF). In
carrier screening, prospective parents find out whether they are at
risk for passing on disease-related genes to their offspring. Prenatal
genetic testing of fetuses in utero is conducted through the use of
blood tests early in a woman's pregnancy, chorionic villus
sampling (CVS) at 10&ndash;12 weeks, and amniocentesis at 15&ndash;18 weeks.
Testing is generally offered to women for whom risk is elevated because
of age or family history; based on the results, women can elect to
continue the pregnancy or abort the
 fetus.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#43" name="note-43">43</a>]</sup>
In PGD, a single cell is
removed from the 8-cell embryo for testing; based on the results, a
decision is made about which embryo(s) to implant in the woman's
uterus. In the U.S., PGD is restricted to private clinics because of
the government's ban on the use of federal funds for
embryo
 research.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#44" name="note-44">44</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Genetic testing carried out at the population level&mdash;for any of
these purposes&mdash;is referred to as genetic screening. Newborn
screening programs to diagnose conditions like PKU, hemoglobinopathies,
etc. on the basis of blood components and circulating metabolites have
been carried out for several decades in many jurisdictions; while such
screening could be expanded to include genetic tests for many more
diseases, without effective treatment measures, this is of limited use.
Ethical debate exists over whether newborn screening should be
mandatory (see Andrews 1994). While successful population-based carrier
screening has been carried out in Sardinia for beta-thalassemia and for
Tay-Sachs among U.S. Ashkenazi Jews, the negative impacts of testing
for sickle-cell anemia among African Americans provide caution for
launching further such programs&mdash;outcome is likely to depend on
the social status of the targeted group (Duster 1990). The pathway from
gene discovery to population-level screening is not straightforward,
however. Although the gene implicated in CF was identified in 1989,
statements issued by the American Society of Human Genetics in 1990 and
1992 and by a NIH workshop in 1990 recommended against instituting
population-based carrier screening because adequate detection rates
were compromised by the heterogeneity of mutations found; in addition,
the clinical course of the disease remained difficult to predict, and
resources for education and counseling were lacking (ASHG 1990; ASHG
1992; NIH Workshop
 1990).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#45" name="note-45">45</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

The 1997 report of the ELSI Working Group's Task Force on
Genetic Testing focuses on ensuring the safety and effectiveness of
genetic tests (Holtzman and Watson 1997)&mdash;an important concern
given the social pressures likely to encourage the expansion of genetic
testing and screening as more tests become available: commercial
interests of the biotech industry; clinicians&rsquo; (and their
malpractice insurers&rsquo;) fears of wrongful birth or wrongful life
lawsuits; and expectations of governments and other institutions (e.g.
private foundations, HMOs) that, by preventing the births of
individuals with costly conditions at sufficient rates, carrier and
prenatal screening programs will prove cost-effective (Holtzman 1989;
Paul 1994a). At the opposite end of the spectrum, the expanding
availability of direct-to-consumer genetic tests, which the report
recommends against, has led to ethical controversy (Beckman 2004). Like
the 1994 report published by the Committee on Assessing Genetic Risks
(Andrews et al. 1994), the Task Force report also stresses the need for
voluntariness, informed consent, confidentiality, legislative
protection against discrimination, improved education of clinicians and
the public, nondirectiveness in reproductive decisions, and
availability of genetic counseling. Professional codes of ethics for
genetic counseling (e.g. the National Society of Genetic Counselors in
the U.S.) emphasize the importance of value-neutral, nondirective
counseling in all of these situations: the goal is for clients to make
their own decisions based on their own values once they are fully
informed about their options. Ethical questions are raised about the
ideals of value-neutrality and nondirectiveness: choosing which
information to present and how to do so inescapably makes evaluative
choices&mdash;for example, emphasizing medical over social information
about disability in prenatal testing (Vehmas 2001); preference for
certain outcomes is built into the system&mdash;for example, abortion
of affected fetuses as society moves to routine prenatal screening
(Bennett 2001); and nondirectiveness can be taken to an extreme where
counselors are hesitant to challenge clients&rsquo; decisions no matter
how inconsistent with their expressed values or irrational they appear
(Singer 1996). Many difficult ethical questions confront genetic
counselors and other clinicians involved in genetic testing in
particular cases. Increased knowledge is not an unmitigated good:
denial may be a coping mechanism; individuals may feel guilty for
passing on harmful mutations to their offspring or stigmatized as
having the potential to do so; survivor guilt may arise in a person who
finds out she is not at risk for HD after all, or she may become at a
loss about how to live her life differently; another person who finds
out he is destined to develop HD or early-onset Alzheimer's may
become depressed or even suicidal; paternity may not be what it is
assumed to be. One person's decision to be tested may also have
ramifications for others: for tests that rely on linkage analysis,
there may be pressure on relatives to be tested; test results may have
implications for the risk status of yet-untested family members;
protecting confidentiality may deprive a spouse or child of important
information. These issues will be tackled in the next two sections
(&ldquo;Genetic Discrimination&rdquo; and &ldquo;Genetic
Privacy&rdquo;).</p>

<p>

Prenatal genetic testing raises serious ethical questions about
reproductive rights and eugenics. Reproductive rights are no longer
just about the right not to have a child (to use contraception, to have
an abortion) or the right to bear a child (to refuse population control
measures). Reproductive rights have come to encompass the right to
access technological assistance to procreate and to have a certain kind
of child (Callahan
 1998).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#46" name="note-46">46</a>]</sup>
The specter of eugenics&mdash;and its images
of involuntary sterilizations, immigration quotas, &ldquo;fitter
family&rdquo; contests, and Nazi death camps&mdash;reappears once
choices are being made about what sort of people are worth bringing
into the world. Many authors have appealed to the history of eugenics
to provide warnings about the dangers of genetic testing or to urge
caution as we move
 forward.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#47" name="note-47">47</a>]</sup>
Historian Diane Paul (1994b) characterizes
eugenics as the &ldquo;&lsquo;approved&rsquo; project anxiety&rdquo;:
given the lapse of time, we inevitably look good compared to earlier
generations (p. 143). Paul notes that attempts to draw lessons from the
history of eugenics are confounded by disagreements about how to define
&ldquo;eugenics&rdquo;&mdash;whether to characterize eugenics according
to a program's intentions or effects, its use of coercive rather
than voluntary means, or its appeals to social and political aims that
extend beyond the immediate concerns of individual families. For some
commentators, even exhortations to choose the &ldquo;best child&rdquo;
are not eugenic because they occur in the realm of &ldquo;private
enterprise&rdquo; and are not directed at improving the population
(Savulescu 2001). Others worry that the private reproductive choices of
individuals will have the &ldquo;backdoor&rdquo; effect of narrowing
society's acceptance of diversity (Duster 1990). We are also
reminded that valuing reproductive autonomy means supporting a
woman's decision not just to abort but to bear a child likely to
have a disease or disability: while she may be free of state
interference, many other factors make this choice
difficult&mdash;pressure from clinicians, refusal of health insurers to
cover the child when born due to the &ldquo;pre-existing
condition,&rdquo; disapproval from other health insurance plan members,
ableist attitudes in society, lack of financial resources, lack of
social support (Hubbard 1990; Hubbard and Wald 1993). Arguably, if
intentions matter, prenatal diagnosis means that eugenics is already
with us: &ldquo;prenatal diagnosis necessarily involves systematic and
systemic selection of fetuses, mostly frequently on genetic
grounds&rdquo; (Lipmann 1991, p. 24). Indeed, Kitcher (1996) seeks to
establish a sound theoretical basis for eugenic practice, envisioning a
&ldquo;laissez-faire&rdquo; eugenics where people are educated to make
&ldquo;responsible&rdquo; procreative decisions based on objective
evaluative judgments of quality of life, not just for the prospective
individual but all others involved&mdash;parents, siblings, and since
funds for social programs are limited, all members of
 society.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#48" name="note-48">48</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Insofar as &ldquo;prenatal diagnosis presupposes that certain fetal
conditions are intrinsically not bearable&rdquo; (Lipmann 1991, p. 25),
we operate within the realm of &ldquo;negative&rdquo;
eugenics&mdash;the selection against unwelcome traits associated with
disease and disability. But the genetic testing of fetuses and embryos
has already moved beyond this. Selective abortion and implantation
decisions are made to obtain a child who is the correct gender or a
prospective tissue donor (Kahn and Mastroianni 2004). A brief internet
search reveals that selection of donor sperm or ova goes even further
along &ldquo;positive&rdquo; eugenic lines (eye and hair color, race
and ethnicity, SAT scores, height, musical ability, etc.); this
demonstrates the central role consumer demand will play in any new
eugenics, calling to mind Robert Nozick's (1974) famous image of
a &ldquo;genetic supermarket&rdquo; (p. 315n). There is extensive
ethical debate about of what &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; procreative
decision-making consists in the context of genetic testing and
selective abortion/implantation. It is argued that parents should
prevent children being born with conditions that will cause severe pain
and suffering (Brody 2002), that parental decisions should not restrict
the autonomy of children-to-be by compromising their right to an open
future with as few limitations as possible (Davis 2001), that parents
should implant embryos without genes associated with disease and
disability to avoid doing harm (Harris 2001), and even that parents
should select the &ldquo;best child&rdquo;&mdash;ostensibly the
&ldquo;most intelligent&rdquo;&mdash;of those they could possibly have
(Savulescu 2001). It is also argued that responsible parenting involves
an unconditional acceptance inconsistent with the willingness to commit
to having only a certain kind of child (Vehmas 2001), and that it
should not be assumed that being born with a disability need be
detrimental &ldquo;either to an individual's prospects of leading
a worthwhile life, or to the families in which they grow up, or to
society at large&rdquo; (Parens and Asch 1999). Often embedded in these
debates is the conundrum that complicates wrongful birth and wrongful
life lawsuits: under what conditions can we say an individual has been
wronged in the context of genetic testing and selective
abortion/implantation when that individual would not otherwise have
existed (Brock 1995)? A condition would have to be severe indeed for
nonexistence to be preferable to existence with the condition. This
provides leeway to argue that parents do no wrong when they refuse
prenatal testing/selective abortion or PGD/selective implantation, or
even make use of these technologies to choose children who, like
themselves, will have congenital deafness or
 dwarfism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#49" name="note-49">49</a>]</sup></p>

<h4>2.2.3 Genetic discrimination</h4>

<p>

People frequently express fears about genetic discrimination
resulting from genetic testing made possible by the HGP. Most concerns
have focused on insurance companies and employers, but as the use of
genetic information proliferates, one can readily imagine other
institutions in society developing an interest in discriminating among
individuals on the basis of such information: schools, departments of
motor vehicles, immigration authorities, creditors, adoption agencies
(Nelkin 1992; Nelkin and Tancredi 1989). A number of general arguments
have been made against institutional forms of genetic discrimination:
we don&rsquo;t choose our genes and ought not be punished for what is
outside our control (Gostin 1991); the social costs of creating a
&ldquo;biologic&rdquo; or &ldquo;genetic underclass&rdquo; of people
who lack health care and are unemployed or stuck in low-wage jobs are
too great (Lee 1993; Nelkin and Tancredi 1989); people's fears of
genetic discrimination, whether realistic or not, may lead them to
forego genetic testing that might benefit their lives and be less
inclined to participate in genetic research (Kass 1997); people have
the right not to know their genetic risk status (Kass 1997). Genetic
discrimination may also occur in less formal circumstances. Mate choice
could increasingly proceed on the basis of genetic information, with
certain people being labeled as undesirable. As more and more fetuses
are aborted on genetic grounds, families of children born with similar
conditions, and people with disabilities and their advocates more
broadly, worry that increased stigmatization will result. One
recommendation to address this concern is that society commit funds
toward maintaining social support services for those with disabilities
even as the numbers of abortions of genetically abnormal fetuses climb
(Kitcher 1996). In addition, group-based genetic research into diseases
or behavioral differences risks stigmatizing people based on racial,
ethnic, and gender differences. It has been recommended that society
invest in public education to combat any racial prejudice behavioral
genetic research might unfurl (Kitcher 1996); arguments have also been
advanced that such research either should not be done or should be held
to more demanding standards than is frequently the case (Kitcher
2001).</p>

<p>

Focused ethical debate has taken place regarding both insurer- and
employer-based genetic discrimination. Insurance companies discriminate
against applicants for health, disability, life, or even mortgage
policies when genetic testing reveals them or a family member to be at
risk of disease or disability. Discrimination takes the form of
refusing coverage on the basis that the genetic susceptibility counts
as a &ldquo;preexisting condition,&rdquo; charging high premiums for
the policy, limiting benefits, or excluding certain conditions. The
insurance industry argues that there is no principled reason to treat
genetic information any differently from other medical information used
in underwriting. They point to the problem of &ldquo;adverse
selection&rdquo;: people who know themselves to be at high risk are
more likely to seek insurance than people who know themselves to be at
low risk, which threatens the market when insurers are deprived of the
same
 information.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#50" name="note-50">50</a>]</sup>
If insurers are prohibited from soliciting
genetic information altogether, they may decide to offer high-cost
policies for those diseases for which testing is available under the
assumption that all applicants are high risk. After all, insurers are
in the very business of discriminating among individuals: arguably,
fair and equitable underwriting requires that those belonging to the
same risk class be treated the same (Meyer 2004; Pokorski 1994). In the
U.S., where unlike other industrialized countries there is no
publicly-funded system of universal health care, genetic discrimination
is a particularly serious worry. The 1993 report of the ELSI Working
Group's Task Force on Genetic Information and Insurance
recommends against the use of genetic information as a basis for
denying health care coverage or care and determining the cost of basic
coverage, and calls for a voluntary moratorium on medical underwriting
by insurance companies until a system of universal health care
is
 established.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#51" name="note-51">51</a>]</sup>
Kitcher's major policy recommendation in his 1996 <em>The Lives
to Come</em> is for a two-tiered health insurance system that provides
universal basic coverage regardless of genetic profile or economic
status, whether provided by a public health care system funded through
progressive taxation or a private system committed to affordable
premiums based on ability to pay. Norman Daniels (1994, 2004) responds
to the contention of insurers that it is their business to discriminate
by drawing a distinction between &ldquo;actuarial fairness&rdquo; and
moral fairness and arguing that underwriting health insurance is unjust
given health care's social function of protecting normal
functioning to ensure equality of opportunity. The case for not
permitting the use of genetic information in underwriting life
insurance has been found morally less compelling by Daniels (2004), but
access is actually more threatened given that the individual market
makes up 10&ndash;15 percent of private health insurance policies but 71
percent of life insurance policies (Kass 1997). In fact, outside the
U.S., where universal health care is available, it is life and other
forms of insurance which have been at the forefront of debate, with
philosophical arguments often appealing to the value of social
solidarity in support of pooling risk (Launis 2003). One proposal is to
prohibit underwriting for life insurance policies below a certain
amount (Kass 1997).</p>

<p>

Some genetic discrimination by employers is connected to health care
coverage, particularly in the U.S. given the lack of universal access:
to lower insurance costs, existing or prospective employees found to be
at genetic risk may be fired or not hired. Other reasons employers may
be interested in genetic information include reducing replacement and
retraining costs, avoiding interruptions in production, and learning
which workers are genetically susceptible or resistant to toxins in the
work environment (MacDonald and Williams-Jones 2002). Already, in the
1960s-70s, companies like DuPont and Dow Chemical were engaged in
genetic testing, both screening for susceptibilities and monitoring for
damage (Draper 1991). Proponents of genetic testing by employers
contend that this is an effective form of preventive medicine and that
critics are technophobic or politically motivated. Opponents are
concerned about lack of empirical validation of tests and inferences,
capacity for informed consent, confidentiality, that focusing on
&ldquo;high-risk workers&rdquo; instead of workplaces diverts attention
away from environmental harms and may lead to the relaxation of
precautions, and that the institution of genetic testing programs
disproportionately affects groups (women, minorities) already
marginalized in the workplace (Draper 1991; Hubbard and Wald 1993;
Nelkin and Tancredi 1989). A familiar example is the use of sickle-cell
carrier screening to exclude African Americans from certain jobs
(Duster 1990).</p>

<p>

Although there is controversy about how extensive genetic
discrimination is (Wertz [2002], for example, questions whether fears
are &ldquo;overblown&rdquo;), a number of documented cases involving
insurers and employers give cause for concern (Billings et al. 1992).
The HMO for a family who already had a child with CF was willing to pay
for the woman's amniocentesis and, if necessary, abortion but
refused health care coverage for the prospective child if born with the
condition (Thompson 1989). An air transportation company asked a
genetic screening program in Canada to test their employee for HD
without his consent (Huggins et al. 1990). In 2002, the Burlington
Northern Santa Fe Railway Company (BNSF) was ordered to pay up to $2.2
million to employees whom they had secretly tested for a genetic
variation supposed to be associated with carpal tunnel syndrome.
Incredibly enough, one of the HGP's own labs&mdash;the
DOE's Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory&mdash;was discovered to be
testing the sickle cell status of African American employees without
their consent using blood samples submitted during their annual
physicals. The problem of genetic discrimination has received extensive
attention from ELSI scholars, activists, politicians, and the public
alike. Finally, in May 2008, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination
Act (GINA) was passed which prohibits U.S. insurance companies and
employers from discriminating on the basis of information derived from
genetic
 tests.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#52" name="note-52">52</a>]</sup>
There have been criticisms of this
legislative approach, however, and not only from insurers and
employers. The criticisms are directed at misconceptions underlying the
singling out of genetic information for protection: &ldquo;These
misconceptions include the presumption that a clear distinction exists
between genetic and nongenetic information, tests, and diseases and the
genetic essentialist belief that genetic information is more
definitive, has greater predictive value, and is a greater threat to
our privacy than is nongenetic medical information&rdquo; (Beckwith and
Alper 1998, p. 208; see also Rothstein 2005). This issue of
&ldquo;genetic exceptionalism&rdquo; is taken up in the next section
(&ldquo;Genetic Privacy&rdquo;).</p>

<h4>2.2.4 Genetic Privacy</h4>

<p>

Ethical debates over genetic privacy have been closely tied to
worries about genetic discrimination by insurers and employers who have
third-party access to genetic information from tests and research.
Although patient confidentiality and genetic privacy are protected
within the physician-patient relationship by professional codes of
ethics, this protection is threatened by new information technologies
and the cost-containment provisions of managed care (Orentlicher 1997).
Employers have access to extensive health information about their
employees, with limited legal protection against divulgence of this
information (Rothstein 1997). Someone who undergoes genetic testing as
a research subject may be forced to divulge this when applying for
insurance (Clayton 1997a). Watson and other HGP proponents seemed aware
from the outset that failure to address the problem of genetic
discrimination would threaten the success of the project. Like many
people, Watson advanced the legal protection of genetic privacy as the
solution: &ldquo;I think that somehow we have to get it into the laws
that anyone's DNA&mdash;the message it gives&mdash;is
confidential and that the only one who has a right to look at it is the
person herself or himself&rdquo; (1992, p.
 172).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#53" name="note-53">53</a>]</sup>
</p>

<p>

The strategy adopted in the U.S. to counter genetic discrimination
through legislation has been to treat genetic information as inherently
private and different from other medical
 information.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#54" name="note-54">54</a>]</sup>
The Genetic Privacy Act,
proposed by George Annas, Leonard Glantz, and Patricia Roche and
designed to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of genetic information,
considers genetic information to be &ldquo;uniquely powerful and
uniquely personal,&rdquo; and therefore deserving of &ldquo;unique
privacy protection&rdquo; under the law (Annas et al. 1995). Various
reasons why genetic information should be regarded as unique or special
are offered: genetic information is considered fundamentally important
to personal identity (Andrews 1997); people may opt to have genetic
testing without considering the effects of such knowledge (Andrews
1997); access to and control of genetic information make it possible for
others to have power over a person's life (Annas 1994); genetic
information provides information about an individual's family
members (Annas 1994; Andrews 1997); genetic information serves as a
&ldquo;future diary&rdquo; (Annas 1993); the ease with which DNA
testing can be carried out makes possible its surreptitious
use&mdash;to ascertain paternity, for example (Richards 2001). The
approach is challenged by bioethicist Thomas Murray, who dubs it
&ldquo;genetic exceptionalism&rdquo; (1997, p. 61). Murray argues that
genetic information is not unique or even distinctive for a number of
reasons: many diseases cannot be classified as genetic or nongenetic;
genetic information can be gleaned from sources other than DNA; it is
difficult to separate genetic and nongenetic information on medical
records; genetic exceptionalism follows from, and in turn fosters,
myths of genetic determinism and genetic
 reductionism.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#55" name="note-55">55</a>]</sup>
Quite aside from this
conceptual debate, there are also practical problems. If genetic
privacy laws allow people the freedom to divulge their status
&ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; as they choose, insurers can offer low
premiums as an incentive to applicants who agree to submit to testing
and are found to be at low risk, and employers could hire only those
applicants willing to undergo testing, just as pre-employment medical
exams and drug screens are carried out now.</p>

<p>

Legal philosopher Anita Allen (1997) identifies four dimensions of
genetic privacy: informational privacy, decisional privacy, physical
privacy, and proprietary privacy. These provide a suitable framework
for discussing various ethical concerns about genetic privacy. The
worries about genetic discrimination and third-party access to genetic
information already discussed are included in <em>informational
privacy</em> (also associated with confidentiality, secrecy, and
anonymity). So are other problems of third-party access which arise
closer to home. A person's test results often have implications
for family members who have not undergone testing, and despite the
sacrifice of confidentiality involved, some geneticists call for family
members to be informed when they are at risk of a serious disease which
is preventable or treatable (see Rhodes 2000). Genetic counselors
confront dilemmas about keeping or revealing secrets, for example,
involving the diagnosis of a child's condition or misattributed
paternity that modifies genetic risk information within families
(Biesecker 1997). <em>Decisional privacy</em> protects people's
ability to make autonomous choices. Decisional privacy is implicated
when people who do not wish to know if they are at risk for a certain
disease face insurance- or employment-based testing or population-wide
screens, or perhaps feel pressured by relatives to be tested in order
to locate a familial mutation. For example, in the case of HD, given
that no treatment at all exists, many at-risk individuals choose not to
avail themselves of testing (World Federation 1993). Bioethical debate
over whether individuals have a right to remain ignorant about their
genetic make-up centers on the requirements of autonomy: it is
alternatively argued that autonomy is advanced when a person's
refusal to be tested is respected (Takala 1999, Takala and Hayry 2000);
that there is a duty to know genetic information that could affect
decision-making, but given possible social consequences, the decision
not to know rests with individuals (Rhodes 1998, 2000); and that the
failure to consider all information relevant to making future choices
undermines our ability to be rational, self-governing agents (Harris
and Keywood 2001). Decisional privacy and the requirements of autonomy
are also at issue in the debate over the legitimacy of parental consent
for the genetic testing of minors for late-onset conditions (Clayton
1997b; Cohen 1998; Sevick et al. 2005). <em>Physical</em> (as well as
decisional) <em>privacy</em> becomes an issue when genetic tests or
screens are performed without a person's voluntary, informed
consent. This occurs, for example, when researchers use stored DNA
samples for purposes that go beyond those to which their donors
provided consent. For example, many countries have decades of stored
&ldquo;Guthrie cards&rdquo; with newborn blood samples provided for
metabolic screening. In the U.S., concern has been raised about the
paucity of regulations regarding third-party access to these as DNA
&ldquo;banks&rdquo; for research (McEwen and Reilly 1994); in
Australia, interest in correlating health records with 30 years of
blood test results provided by newborn screening has resulted in
consultation over the use and storage of genetic samples and
information (Ankeny 2003). <em>Proprietary privacy</em> is involved
should a person's genetic material or information be appropriated
for economic purposes. <em>Moore v. Regents of the University of
California</em> is a well-known litigation case involving proprietary
(as well as decisional and physical) privacy. In the course of his
treatment for leukemia at the UCLA Medical Center, John Moore's
spleen was removed, and then, without his knowledge or consent, used to
develop a commercially lucrative cell line. The court ruled that
Moore's right to informed consent was breached, but that he had
no property rights over the cell line. Philosophers have approached
this question about property rights over DNA from Lockean and Rawlsian
perspectives on justice (Farrelly 2002; Moore 2000).</p>

<p>

As DNA banking and DNA data banking efforts proliferate with few
laws to restrict the future use of samples or prevent the transfer of
data, and given that any blood or tissue collection is a potential DNA
bank, people may lose any hope of keeping their genetic profile
private. The U.S. Department of Defense has the world's largest
DNA bank: all military personnel are required to provide blood and
saliva samples so that the remains of missing soldiers can be
identified (McEwen 1997). The U.K.'s forensic DNA bank will
eventually include a substantial portion of its population: the 2003
Criminal Justice Act requires anyone arrested for&mdash;not necessarily
charged with, much less convicted of&mdash;a recordable offense to
submit a DNA
 sample<sup>[<a href="notes.html#56" name="note-56">56</a>]</sup>;
in the U.S. such requirements vary
state-by-state (McEwen 1997). As the technology becomes cheaper, the
proposal to create a national DNA data bank by sampling every newborn
child could arise (Bereano 1992). This repository of data would serve a
number of purposes in addition to forensic ones: provide an identity
tag (like social security numbers); enable economic planning based on
genetic risk factors; support research into the genetic basis of
medical and behavioral traits; identify remains; identify children
recovered after being kidnapped; monitor individuals presumed to be
predisposed to criminal violence; identify potential transplant donors;
etc. A number of countries have already created population-level DNA
banks and data banks to aid in research into complex diseases (Kaiser
2002), with deCODE Genetics&rsquo; initiative in Iceland, which
combines genetic, medical, and genealogical data and operates on the
basis of presumed consent, the most well-known. On a smaller scale, DNA
is also banked by researchers in academic institutions, commercial
labs, and hospitals. Additional privacy concerns arise in research
contexts where DNA profiles are linked to phenotypic features (clinical
data and lifestyle information) and not used just for forensic
identification. Bioethicists looking at &ldquo;biobanks&rdquo; have
focused on the problems prospective research poses for consent, and the
adequacy of such provisions as opting in or opting out, waiving or
giving blanket consent, withdrawing or renewing consent, etc.
(Helgesson and Johnsson 2005; Shickle 2006). Onora O&rsquo;Neill (2001)
questions whether informed consent even remains a realistic goal given
the amount of genetic data being banked. She argues that consent to
specific propositions cannot be extended to closely related ones, and
that the lack of explicit dissent cannot be taken as tacit or implied
consent. O&rsquo;Neill reminds us that consent to the collection,
storage, and use of genetic and other data is not sought within the
confines of the doctor-patient relationship where privacy is governed
by professional standards; rather, the relationship is many-many and
privacy is dependent on methods of data protection for which public
rather than individual consent becomes appropriate. However, as genetic
sequencing becomes a routine part of health care, with all the
information researchers need contained in patient records, similar
concerns about privacy will arise in the health care sector (Hansson
2004).</p>

<h4>2.2.5 Genetic Modification (GM)</h4>

<p>

The HGP will assist scientists in the identification of genes and
their functions. As scientists gain knowledge about how various genes
contribute to phenotype, genetic modification will become possible.
Such interventions could involve knocking out a gene with a detrimental
role, or inserting a gene with a beneficial role, though because of
gene-gene and gene-environment interactions (as discussed in section
2.1.4.), it will be difficult to predict the effects of many such
interventions. The first approved GM procedure was performed in 1990
when NIH scientists genetically modified white blood cells in Ashanti
DeSilva, a four-year-old girl with adenosine deaminase deficiency
(ADA). Over 1000 clinical trials have since been performed (Rasko et
al. 2006, Gene Therapy Clinical Trials Worldwide Database),
with studies carried out on numerous diseases, including CF,
Franconi's anemia, muscular dystrophy, and hemophilia. A serious
setback occurred when 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger died in a University
of Pennsylvania gene therapy trial for ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC)
deficiency in 1999. Shortly after, a French research team successfully
restored the immune systems of young children with severe combined
immunodeficiency (SCID) through gene therapy; this success was
tempered, however, when several of the children later developed
leukemia as a result of the procedure. Given these problems with safety
and efficacy, gene therapy trials have shifted from
&ldquo;single-gene&rdquo; diseases to conditions like cancer,
cardiovascular disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, where vector
applications are more local and transient (Branca 2005).</p>

<p>

Procedures carried out to date involve the GM of somatic cells, but
GM could potentially be applied to gametes or IVF embryos, resulting in
the genetic changes being passed on to future generations: this is
referred to as germ-line GM, or more recently (Rasko et al. 2006),
&ldquo;inheritable genetic modification.&rdquo; Some bioethicists argue
that the distinction between somatic cell and germ-line GM has moral
significance, and that somatic cell interventions alone are
permissible. A number of arguments are offered against germ-line GM:
the long-term effects are uncertain; germ-line interventions are
eugenic given that future generations are not patients; only existing
persons can provide informed consent (Lapp&eacute; 1991); humans have a
basic right to be born with an unmodified genome (Mauron and Thevoz
1991); some modifications alter personal identity (Zohar 1991); and
human trials face daunting ethical and practical challenges (Dresser
2004). Bioethicists who support germ-line GM counter these arguments
with others: parents have reproductive autonomy (Zimmerman 1991); the
fetus is being treated as a patient in prenatal surgeries, so why not
the embryo (Nolan 1991); we constantly modify the conditions future
generations inherit, and usually not with altruistic purposes (e.g.,
degraded environments) (Peters 1995); members of future generations
would presumably consent to an augmentation of Rawlsian primary goods
(Allhoff 2005); modifications could be reversed if harmful effects
arise (Moseley 1991); the germ line might be the only or most effective
level for intervention in some diseases (Munson and Davis 1992;
Zimmerman 1991); germ-line interventions would avoid subsequent
generations of a family having to undergo somatic cell GM or worry
about carrier status (Munson and Davis 1992).</p>

<p>

The distinction between therapy and enhancement, as it applies to
both somatic cell and germ-line GM, is also considered by some
bioethicists to have moral significance: interventions that restore
normal function from a state of disease or disability (negative GM) are
considered permissible whereas interventions that improve on normal
function (positive GM) are
 not.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#57" name="note-57">57</a>]</sup>
Arguments against genetic enhancement
include: clinical risks outweigh possible benefits (Anderson 1990); it
violates parents&rsquo; fiduciary responsibilities (Schonfeld 2003);
genetic diversity will be diminished (Parens 1995); the socially
acceptable range of traits will be narrowed (Agar 1995); the principle
of equality of opportunity (Daniels 1994) and the Rawlsian imperative
to help the worst off (Fleck 1994) support negative but not positive
GM; appreciation of shared human &ldquo;fragility&rdquo; and the
accomplishments of individuals may diminish (Parens 1995). A further
distinction can be drawn between enhancements that go beyond species
typicality to improve health (e.g. disease-resistant genes) and
enhancements of social value (e.g. eye color), and it is argued that
there is no moral difference between using GM to augment function and
using GM to restore function if the aim is disease prevention (Harris
1993; Juengst 1997). Some bioethicists who support GM for enhancement
as well as therapeutic purposes counter these arguments by asserting
the reproductive autonomy of parents (Stock 2003). Others point to the
lack of an objective and/or morally justified distinction between
therapy and enhancement, health and disease (Goering 2000;
Resnik
 2000).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#58" name="note-58">58</a>]</sup>
Indeed, with GM, we humans ourselves determine what counts as
&ldquo;normal&rdquo; genetic variation, no longer needing to look to a
pre-existing species-typical functional norm (Resnik 1997b). The moral
permissibility of particular genetic interventions, therapies and
enhancements alike, might instead be assessed according to Rawlsian
principles&mdash;with equality of opportunity and concern for the worst
off supporting the prohibition of some enhancements and the guarantee
of a minimal level of genetic health (Resnik 1997b), or a permissible
intervention one which, when contemplated in the original position
behind a veil of ignorance, can be seen to prevent a condition that
would be detrimental in all societies or bring about a condition that
would never be detrimental in any society (Goering 2000).</p>

<p>

GM of the germ line for either therapeutic or enhancement purposes
and GM of somatic cells for enhancement purposes have not yet been
carried out in
 humans.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#59" name="note-59">59</a>]</sup>
Of the four classes of interventions
delineated by somatic-cell/germ-line and therapy/enhancement
distinctions, only germ-line GM for enhancement purposes remains
particularly contentious among bioethicists (Allhoff 2005). Of course,
GM of the germ line of plants and nonhuman animals has
become
 commonplace,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#60" name="note-60">60</a>]</sup>
and some commentators argue that the use of GM for enhancement purposes
in humans is inevitable (Baylis and Robert 2004; Stock 2003). After
all, look at parents who seek every advantage for their child on route
to an Ivy League education, athletes who use illegal
performance-enhancing drugs, increased use of plastic surgery,
recreational use of Viagra, etc. Genetic modification of the germ line
might be even more likely to be embraced for positive/enhancement than
negative/therapeutic purposes, since if IVF is being used, concerns
about a particular disease can be allayed with PGD and selective
implantation. However, as more and more conditions&mdash;whether
diseases or not&mdash;can be screened for in embryos, distinctions
between therapy and enhancement and enhancement for health vs. social
purposes&mdash;already problematic conceptually, a situation compounded
by the newfound plasticity of the species adaptive norm&mdash;may break
down even further in practice.</p>

<p>

Already in 1969, Sinsheimer foresaw the promise of molecular biology
to remake human nature: &ldquo;For the first time in all time, a living
creature understands its origin and can undertake to design its
future&rdquo; (in Kevles 1992, p. 18). Remaking human nature is likely
to begin with genetic modifications that convey the possibility of
resistance to a serious disease, like HIV/AIDS, or minimize the effects
of aging to extend lifespan, but transhumanists who view human nature
as &ldquo;a work-in-progress, a half-baked beginning that we can learn
to remold in desirable ways&rdquo; welcome improvements in memory,
intelligence, and emotional capacities as well (Bostrom 2003, p. 493).
Widespread inheritable GM could lead to a &ldquo;radical rupture&rdquo;
with evolutionary processes as we understand them
today&mdash;undermining the distinction between acquired and
inheritable traits, challenging our abilities to reconstruct genetic
genealogies, and even creating a new hominid species (Baylis and Robert
2006). Words chosen for titles of recent books&mdash;for example,
&ldquo;the future of human nature&rdquo; (Habermas 2003), &ldquo;our
posthuman future&rdquo; (Fukuyama 2002), and &ldquo;redesigning
humans&rdquo; (Stock 2003)&mdash;reveal that a serious debate is
underway about the prospect of a genetically engineered human nature
and what this means for all of us. Some are practically giddy about
this &ldquo;journey to destinations of new imagination&rdquo; (Stock
2003, p. 1); others warn that it will undo the &ldquo;intimate
connection between human nature and human notions of rights, justice,
and morality&rdquo; (Fukuyama 2002, p. 101).</p>

<h4>2.2.6 Justice and the genome</h4>

<p>

The HGP was initially criticized on the basis that the
government's support of such a large-scale project would take
resources away from other programs arguably more important for health
and wellbeing, such as, in the U.S., instituting a system of universal
health care or funding prenatal care for poor women. Cures for disease
arising from the HGP, after all, are likely to benefit future not
existing people (Murphy 1994). These concerns were compounded by the
worry that increased scientific attention paid to genetic factors
implicated in health and disease would promote interventions at the
level of the genome&mdash;genetic tests, genetic modifications, drug
development based on gene sequences, etc.&mdash;and that the need to
address the impacts of harmful physical and social environments due to
toxins, poverty, racism, etc. would be ignored (Hubbard and Wald 1993).
The problem of racial profiling in the legal system was raised: if
members of particular racial and ethnic groups are more likely to be
arrested, charged, or convicted of a criminal offense, they are more
likely to be required to provide DNA samples to forensic databases, and
therefore more likely to come back into the system with future
offenses. One proposed solution is for a national database which
includes everyone (Kitcher 1996), though it is also argued that this
compromises the autonomy and dignity of individual citizens (Boylan
2002). And given the history of using biological explanations to
provide ideological justification for social inequalities associated
with oppressive power structures, the prospective use of molecular
genetics to explain race and sex differences has also met with caution
(Hubbard 1994).</p>

<p>

With completion of the HGP, concerns of justice increasingly focus
on the distribution of benefits and burdens of genetic technologies,
especially given that the HGP was funded by public monies. One of the
&ldquo;majestic horizons&rdquo; identified by Clinton in June 2000
represented a call for justice&mdash;specifically, ethical respect for
&ldquo;our oldest and most cherished human values&rdquo; to ensure that
genome science benefits &ldquo;all citizens of the world&rdquo; and
prevents discrimination. And yet, another of Clinton's
&ldquo;majestic horizons&rdquo;&mdash;biotechnological development in
the private sector based on the identification of all human genes and
their functions&mdash;raises significant challenges for justice. While
the HGP's vision of &ldquo;individualized preventive
medicine&rdquo; will no doubt promote biotechnological development in
the private sector, is this development likely to benefit &ldquo;all
citizens of the world&rdquo;? Globally, in the developing world,
infectious diseases are more of a priority than genetic diseases; in
the U.S., millions of citizens and residents are without or lack
adequate health care coverage for the routine preventive care and
treatment of acute illnesses and injuries proponents of genomic
medicine take for granted. Profits direct pharmaceutical research and
development: efforts are expended on conditions that are relatively
frequent and sometimes minor (e.g. male-pattern baldness [Ellis and
Sinclair 2008]); conditions prevalent in affluent countries receive
more attention than those prevalent in developing countries (Flory and
Kitcher 2004); and populations in the developing world are vulnerable
to exploitation (Dickenson 2004). &ldquo;All citizens of the
world&rdquo; will not have access to the expensive new drugs: in the
U.S., beneficiaries will be the wealthy and those with generous
prescription drug plans; in the developing world, it remains a struggle
to make drugs to treat serious diseases like HIV/AIDS affordable and
accessible to all who need them.</p>

<p>

Concerns have arisen, not just that there will be unequal access to
the benefits of genetic technologies, but that the use of these
technologies will exacerbate existing patterns of social and economic
inequality. As mentioned in section 2.2.3, genetic discrimination by
insurers and employers could lead to creation of a &ldquo;genetic
underclass&rdquo;; similarly, should socioeconomically advantaged
families have greater access to prenatal genetic testing, an increased
relative frequency of conditions like CF, sickle cell anemia, or Down
syndrome would occur among less privileged families. To the extent that
race and ethnicity correlate with socioeconomic status, some
groups&mdash;already affected by disparities in health outcomes
unrelated to genetic differences&mdash;will be disproportionately
represented among this &ldquo;genetic underclass.&rdquo; If genetic
enhancement becomes available and is used disproportionately by those
belonging to advantaged groups, there is the potential for the
socioeconomic gap to widen further&mdash;think of the diminished range
of opportunities available to the genetically unenhanced Vincent in the
film <em>Gattaca</em>. An entirely new class structure based on genetic
makeup as remolded by culture is foreseen: some welcome
humanity's fragmentation into &ldquo;independent
breeds&mdash;future human Saint Bernard and dachshund analogs&rdquo;
corresponding to the enhanced and the unenhanced, or family lineages
where similar enhancement choices are made in successive generations
(Stock 2003); others fear this imperils the continuation of liberal
democratic society (Mehlman 2003; Mehlman and Botkin 1998). There are
also those who see possibilities for increased equality. One reason is
that environments could be tailored to the genetic predispositions of
individuals based on better knowledge of gene-environment interactions
(Buchanan et al. 2000). Another reason is that the genetic technologies
on the horizon challenge the natural-social distinction by making the
natural lottery, like the social lottery, alterable: the state could
redistribute or narrow the range of differences in natural abilities as
is often done for social resources in order to promote equality of
opportunity or benefit the worst off (Buchanan et al. 2000;
Resnik
 1997b).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#61" name="note-61">61</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

These concerns about differential access to the benefits of genetic
technologies and the likely social consequences of such differential
access have been addressed by bioethicists and moral philosophers from
perspectives informed by competing theories of distributive justice.
Libertarians support the &ldquo;genetic supermarket&rdquo; famously
envisioned by Nozick, where prospective parents and resulting market
forces determine which genetic modifications are offered&mdash;not
centralized decisions made by biologists or government. It has been
noted, however, that what is harmless or beneficial in individual cases
(e.g. sex selection, increased longevity, competitive goods like beauty
or intelligence) may be neutral or even harmful for society taken
collectively (Kavka 1994). And yet, given that the state does not
restrict parental autonomy when it comes to environmental boosts to
their children's abilities (e.g. private schools, music lessons),
it is argued that there is no principled distinction between genes and
environments which would override a similar right to genetic
enhancements (Buchanan et al. 2000). Liberals have used Rawlsian
principles to urge a variety of state-imposed limits on a free market
in genetic technologies (Brown 2001; Buchanan et al. 2000; Daniels
1994; Farrelly 2002; Resnik 1997b). In their 2000 book <em>From Chance
to Choice: Genetics and Justice</em>, in order to protect equal
opportunity, Allen Buchanan, Dan Brock, Norman Daniels, and Daniel
Wikler argue that the state should ensure access to a &ldquo;genetic
decent minimum&rdquo; which includes interventions directed to natural
primary goods&mdash;whether treatments or enhancements&mdash;insofar as
these are consistent with the neutrality of liberal democracies
concerning conceptions of the
 good.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#62" name="note-62">62</a>]</sup>
Parental choices would be limited only where
these are inconsistent with a child's right to an open future,
carry a risk to public good (e.g. sex selection resulting in societal
imbalance), diminish equal opportunity if available only to the
comparatively well off, or involve enhancements with &ldquo;positional
advantages&rdquo; (e.g. height) that would be self-defeating if widely
available and unfair&mdash;and contrary to Rawls&rsquo; difference
principle which requires permissible inequalities to work to the
advantage of all, especially the worst off&mdash;if not, and where
enhancements would lead to the disabling of others by raising the bar
for what is required to participate in society's &ldquo;dominant
cooperative
 scheme.&rdquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#63" name="note-63">63</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Of particular interest in current philosophical debates about
justice and the genome is the consensus which has emerged among
participants that our usual ways of thinking about justice are
themselves challenged by the new genetic technologies (Buchanan et
al.
 2000).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#64" name="note-64">64</a>]</sup>
Theories of justice are typically based on conceptions of human nature,
but with the capacity to remake human nature, this foundation
disappears. Approaches to distributive justice seek to compensate for
natural inequalities existing at birth among individuals of fixed
identities, but considerations of justice are now implicated earlier,
in decisions about the distribution of genetic characteristics,
decisions which affect the identities of those born. The potential for
genetic stratification places at risk the assumption central to all
theorizing about justice&mdash;that we share a moral community.</p>

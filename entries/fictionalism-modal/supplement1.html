<h2>A Persisting Problem For Fictionalism About Possible Worlds</h2>

<p>

At least since Gideon Rosen&rsquo;s 1990, the theory that talk about
possible worlds should be interpreted as a useful fiction has been
taken seriously by many philosophers as a way we might be able to
have, in Lewis&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;paradise on the cheap&rdquo;
(Lewis 1986, p. 
 136).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-9" id="ref-9">9</a>]</sup>
</p>

<p>
 The point of fictionalism about possible worlds is that if it is
successful, it enables one to use the conceptual resources of
possible-world semantics without needing the ontological baggage that
realism about such worlds carries. The strategy is to employ an
account of possible worlds (e.g. David
 Lewis&rsquo;s),<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-10" id="ref-10">10</a>]</sup>
 but insist that the account is only a useful fiction. A modal claim
will then be true iff its translation into possible-world semantics
is true in the fiction (let us call the account treated as fiction by
Rosen the &ldquo;Lewis
 story&rdquo;).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-11" id="ref-11">11</a>]</sup>
 So, for example, <em>P</em> is possible iff, in the Lewis story, there exists
a possible world where <em>P</em> is true. Of course, this does not imply that
in reality there is a possible world such that <em>P</em> is true (at least as
far as the fictionalist is concerned), any more than its being true
in the Arthur legend that King Arthur defeated the Emperor Augustus
implies that Arthur (if he existed) really defeated Augustus in
battle.</p>

<p>
 A problem was raised for modal fictionalism independently by Rosen
(1993) and Stuart Brock (1993). This problem, to put it in a perhaps
oversimplified form, is that since in the Lewis story it is true at
each possible world that there are many worlds, it is, <em>according
to the fiction</em> (or, according to the story), true at every
possible world that there exist many worlds. But the truth conditions
offered by a Rosen-style fictionalist state that if according to the
fiction a proposition <em>P</em> is true at every world, then <em>P</em> is (in fact)
necessarily true.  Therefore, it follows in this case that
necessarily there are several possible worlds, and so since
(necessarily <em>P</em>) implies <em>P</em>, there in fact exist several possible
worlds, which is not something the fictionalist should
countenance.</p>

<p>
 This problem is discussed in a paper by Peter Menzies and Philip
Pettit (1994) who claim to show that the objection is not fatal, and
that there is a coherent and plausible fictionalist way of avoiding
it. Menzies and Pettit propose that the fictionalist operator needs
to be applied to every quantifier in a modal claim when translating
into possible-world talk, either by employing a &ldquo;prefixing&rdquo; strategy
or an &ldquo;indexing&rdquo; strategy (for details see their paper). So while it
is not true (for the Menzies/Pettit fictionalist) that &ldquo;necessarily
there exist several worlds&rdquo;, what is in fact true in virtue of there
being several possible worlds that exist at each fictional world is
that &ldquo;necessarily, according to the fiction there exist several
worlds&rdquo;, which is not a claim incompatible with fictionalism at
all. However, they recognize a <em>further</em> problem for
fictionalism: a problem involving a so-called &ldquo;modal dangler&rdquo;, or a
modal claim that concerns the truth (or in this case, possible truth)
of the theory
 itself.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-12" id="ref-12">12</a>]</sup>
 This supplement will consist of a discussion of this problem, an
examination of the solution proposed for it by Menzies and Pettit,
and an explanation of why the proposed solution is so far
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>
 This further objection is more or less as follows: The Lewis story
(or the &ldquo;hypothesis of the plurality of worlds&rdquo; (PW) as it is
referred to by Brock and Menzies/Pettit) will, according to the Lewis
story, be something that is true at every world in the Lewis
story. This causes the modal fictionalist a real problem, because
given the standard paraphrase into possible world semantics,
something is necessary iff it is the case at every possible world.
Since, in the Lewis story, the Lewis story is correct at every
possible world, then the fictionalist who is prepared to translate
modal claims into claims about possible worlds (albeit fictional
ones) is forced to admit that the truth of the Lewis story is
necessary, and thus the Lewis &ldquo;story&rdquo; is no mere fiction, but
actually correct. (Necessarily-<em>P</em> implies <em>P</em>). However, it is precisely
PW, or the Lewis story, that the fictionalist wants to argue is
<em>false</em> in the actual world. It appears that the fictionalist
(at least one who follows the strategy described) is committed to the
truth, and even necessary truth, of the very thesis fictionalism was
developed to deny.</p>

<p>
 Menzies and Pettit suggest an alternative way of constructing
one&rsquo;s possible-worlds fictionalism to avoid any commitment to
the necessary truth of the Lewis story. They start by pointing to the
special status that the actual world has among worlds.  Other worlds
are (according to our fictionalist) purely fictional entities, so
what is true
 at<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-13" id="ref-13">13</a>]</sup>
 them is completely determined by the fiction.  What is true at the
actual world, however, is not determined by what (modal-) fictional
stories we choose to tell about it. The truth conditions for the
&ldquo;modal danglers&rdquo; (statements concerning the modal status of the modal
fictionalist theory itself) are to reflect this, on the
Menzies-Pettit proposal. According to the proposed paraphrase for the
part of modal discourse concerned with modal danglers,</p>

<blockquote>
 Possibly <em>P</em> if and only if &lsquo;<em>P</em>&rsquo; holds at the actual world or
at one of the other worlds in PW.

<p>
 Necessarily <em>P</em> if and only if &lsquo;<em>P</em>&rsquo; holds at the actual world
and at all of the other worlds posited in PW (1994, p. 36)</p>
 </blockquote>

<p>

Note that these truth conditions do not say &ldquo;if &lsquo;<em>P</em>&rsquo; holds
in the actual world <em>on the PW account</em>&rdquo;. These truth
conditions involve what the actual world is really like, and not
merely what it is like in a given fictional account. Thus this view
allows us to conclude that PW, or the Lewis story, is not necessary,
and so we are not forced to admit that it is true.</p>

<p>
 This modification works to defuse Brock&rsquo;s specific objection
about the expressibility of the falsehood of PW, but it does not
defuse objections based on counterfactual situations where we would
want to say that the Lewis story is not correct. For instance,
consider the quite plausible counterfactual &ldquo;If there were a king of
France, still PW would be false&rdquo;. A fictionalist should want to
accept this: after all, changes in the political situation in France
will not produce changes in the fundamental truths of the metaphysics
of modality (France is not <em>that</em> important). However,
consider this modal claim: &ldquo;It is possible that there be a present
king of France and also that PW be false&rdquo;. Now, it is not true of the
actual world that there is a king of France, and it is not true of
any of the (supposedly fictional) possible worlds that PW is false
there (after all, in the Lewis story, the Lewis story (or PW) holds
at every world). The above modal claim about the king and PW is thus
false. For a counterfactual with a contingent antecedent to be true
it must be possible that the antecedent and consequent be true
together. Since it is impossible that there be a king of France and
PW be false, it seems that the initially plausible counterfactual
cannot be held to be true by the fictionalist.</p>

<p>
 This sort of objection, of course, is a general one: nothing hinges
on the mentioning of the present king of France, as almost any
counterfactual will do. The general point is that a fictionalist
should be committed, on the grounds of the irrelevance of most
changes in the world to the truth of fictionalism, to saying that
even if the world had turned out slightly differently, still the
Lewis story would have been merely fiction: and this is something
that cannot be coherently maintained by a fictionalist who accepts
the Menzies/Pettit truth conditions for modal statements.</p>

<p>
 One might be tempted to think that the entire problem of the modal
status of modal danglers (i.e. those statements that concern the
truth or modal status of the theory itself) is one that can be
ignored, or at least easily avoided, by the fictionalist. After all,
the modal danglers are a pretty special class of truths, unlikely to
make an impact on science or semantics or other fields in which
possible worlds are useful. One way of avoiding the problem of &ldquo;modal
danglers&rdquo; is to restrict fictionalism so that it does not consider
the modal status of the theory itself, but that the theory functions
as some sort of &ldquo;metalanguage&rdquo; immune to the modal interpretation
available for all other areas of discourse. There are at least two
good reasons for resisting this strategy,
 however.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-14" id="ref-14">14</a>]</sup>
</p>

<p>
 Firstly, it seems <em>ad hoc</em>. Possibility seems to be the same
thing in both the sentences &ldquo;Possibly PW is false&rdquo; and &ldquo;Possibly
Phlogiston Theory is false&rdquo;: merely using the word &ldquo;metalanguage&rdquo;
does not provide explanatory power. Secondly, it leaves the
&ldquo;possibly&rdquo; operator in modal danglers as a primitive. If we are going
to have primitive unanalyzed modalities besides that of &ldquo;truth in
fiction&rdquo; in our theory anyway, why bother with an analysis of
modality in terms of truth-in-fiction? Why not say that all of the
modal operators reflect primitive features of the world and abandon
the attempt to analyse modality in terms of a modal fiction?</p>

<p>
 It is too early to say that a Rosen-style modal fictionalism must be
abandoned &mdash; after all, merely showing that it has not yet succeeded
in analysing the full range of modal claims (e.g. modal danglers)
does not imply that it cannot do so, but only that it has
not. However, even given the Menzies/Pettit modifications to
Rosen&rsquo;s original proposal, modal danglers remain a difficulty
for modal fictionalism.  Those eager to promote fictionalist analyses
of possible worlds talk owe us an answer to this
 problem.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-15" id="ref-15">15</a>]</sup>

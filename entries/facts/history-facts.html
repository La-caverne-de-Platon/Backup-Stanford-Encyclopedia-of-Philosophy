<h2>On the History of Philosophies of Facts</h2>

<h3>1. Facts as True Propositions</h3>

<p>
Frege is an influential friend of the view that facts are true
truth-bearers. He writes in 1918 that a &ldquo;fact is a thought that
is true&rdquo; (Frege 1918 [1988: 35]; Ramsey 1927 [1931]). Dummett
comments: &ldquo;Facts, as true thoughts, &hellip; belong, not to the
realm of reference, but to that of sense&rdquo; (Dummett 1973: 442;
Ducasse 1968; Dodd 2000). Did Frege think that all true thoughts are
facts? He had earlier reserved the term &ldquo;fact&rdquo; for
non-provable, non-general truths (Frege 1884: &sect;3, cf. &sect;77;
Levine 1996). But the founder of modern semantics has almost no use
for the category of facts understood as anything other than true
thoughts or for the category of states of affairs.
(&ldquo;Almost&rdquo; because in his <em>Begriffsschrift</em> Frege
refers to circumstances, for example the circumstance that a
<em>perpetuum mobile</em> is possible (Frege 1879: &sect;5; on this
exception, see Frege 1879 [1964: 117&ndash;118], Gardies 1985: ch.
7).) Frege&rsquo;s great predecessor, Bolzano, had no use for facts or
states of affairs, nor did Frege&rsquo;s great successor, Tarski.</p>

<h3>2. Facts as Exemplifications</h3>

<p>
F. H. Bradley used the word &ldquo;fact&rdquo; as a technical
philosophical term towards the end of the nineteenth century. It seems
very likely that he did not use the word to refer to obtaining states
of affairs. But just what a Bradleyan fact amounts to is by no means
clear. Bradley says that &ldquo;[e]very kind of fact must possess
these two sides of existence and content&rdquo; where
&ldquo;content&rdquo; refers to what Bradley calls the &ldquo;complex
of qualities and relations&rdquo; a fact contains. But he also says
that one class of facts, in addition to existence and content, have
meaning (Bradley 1883 [1922: 3]). Bradley calls a fact an event or
something else which is immediately experienced (Bradley 1893:
317) and he rejects
disjunctive facts (Bradley 1883 [1922: 46&ndash;7]). Whatever a
Bradleyan fact is, influential arguments to the effect that facts must
be allowed if Bradley&rsquo;s regress is to blocked can perhaps be
traced back to Bradley (1893). Bradley&rsquo;s conception of facts as
primitive qualified existents seems to be also one main source of the
view here described as the view that facts are exemplifications of
properties.</p>

<p>
Russell identifies some particular facts with occurrences such as the
death of Socrates and others with what he calls
&ldquo;conditions&rdquo;, for example the condition of the weather in
1918 (Russell 1918 [1956]: 182, Russell 1940 [1967: 227,
268, 288]; cf. Wisdom 1931, Austin 1970). Such particular facts, he
also says, consist in the possession of qualities or properties by
things (Russell 1918 [1956]: 192). In 1921 McTaggart, too, conceives of facts as <em>sui
generis</em> entities in which objects possess qualities or stand in
relations:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If I say &ldquo;the table is square&rdquo; the only thing which can
make my assertion true is the fact that the table <em>is</em>
square&mdash;that is, the possession by the table of the quality of
squareness (McTaggart 1921: Vol. I, &sect;9 p. 10).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed he &ldquo;defines&rdquo; a fact as &ldquo;either the possession
by anything of a quality, or the connection of anything with anything
by a relation&rdquo;. Substances, qualities, relations and facts are
existents and McTaggart does not seem to think of qualities or
relations as parts of facts (McTaggart 1921: Vol. I, &sect;10 p.
11).</p>

<p>
Facts so conceived might be called B-Facts, in honor of Bradley or of
the many British philosophers who espoused such creatures (Wisdom
1931, 1970), were it not the case that by far the most powerful
defense of such facts is due to the Australian philosopher, David
Armstrong. An Armstrongian state of affairs (or fact) exists </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
if an only if a particular (at a later point to be dubbed a
<em>thin</em> particular) has a property or, instead, a relation holds
between two or more particulars. Each state of affairs, and each
constituent of each state of affairs, meaning by their constituents
the particulars, properties, relations and, in the case of
higher-order states of affairs, lower-order states of affairs, is a
contingent existence (Armstrong 1997: 1) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
for an ontology of facts some of which contain substantial universals,
see Johansson 2004; one of Armstrong&rsquo;s critics argues that
Armstrong&rsquo;s 1997 account of facts as truthmakers implicitly
appeals to an ontological kind he seeks to avoid: states of affairs as
possibilia, which are facts only if they obtain (Hochberg 1999).</p>

<h3>3. Facts as Obtaining States of Affairs</h3>

<p>
The category of obtaining states of affairs is prominent in the
writings of Husserl and Meinong, and of their numerous followers.
Meinong speaks of obtaining objectives, rather than of obtaining
states of affairs, since, as he correctly points, out the term
&ldquo;<em>Sachverhalt</em>&rdquo; connotes factuality in ordinary
language (Meinong 1902: GA IV: 101). Husserl in 1901 calls &ldquo;an
objective state of affairs&rdquo; a &ldquo;fact&rdquo; (Husserl
<em>LU</em> [1973: V &sect;33, p. 623]). According to Meinong in 1902,
&ldquo;an objective, which obtains, is also called [a]
&lsquo;fact&rsquo; &rdquo; (Meinong 1902: 189; 1977: GA IV: 69).
Husserl and his followers employ
the term &ldquo;fact&rdquo; for obtaining states of affairs only
infrequently and typically employ the term to refer to contingent
matters of fact. Meinong and his followers, on the other hand, devote
a great deal of attention to what they call factual objectives and
facts in their theories of semantics and of modality (Sierszulska
2006).</p>

<p>
As already noted, Wittgenstein announces in 1921 that the world is the
totality (<em>Gesamtheit</em>) of facts, that all facts are contingent
and that a fact is the obtaining or non-obtaining of a state of
affairs. Black comments:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Against the background of earlier metaphysics, the outstanding
innovation of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s ontology is his characterisation of
the universe (&lsquo;the world&rsquo;) as an aggregate of facts, not
of things&hellip;This sets him off sharply from Aristotle, Spinoza,
Descartes&mdash;indeed from any of the &lsquo;classical
philosophers&rsquo; who come readily to mind&hellip;. (Black 1971:
27)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Although Husserl, like Meinong, thinks that there are contingent and
non-contingent facts, in one early passage he conceives of the
world&mdash;the Great Matter of Fact&mdash;in the same way as
Wittgenstein: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
For the world is nothing more than the unified objectual totality
(<em>gesamte gegenst&auml;ndliche Einheit</em>) corresponding to, and
inseparable from, the ideal system of all truths about matter of facts
(<em>Tatsachenwahrheit</em>). (Husserl <em>LU</em>: P &sect;36 (6))
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&ldquo;truths about matters of fact&rdquo; here means truths about
Humean matters of fact. But the &ldquo;totality&rdquo; Husserl refers
to is the totality of facts, in the functorial sense, which
corresponds to the system of all truths about matters of fact.</p>

<p>
The phenomenologist Max Scheler argues that the question whether the
world consists of things or of facts should receive one answer in the
world-view of ordinary life and another in the world-view of science.
One major difference between the natural world-view of ordinary life
(of natural language and natural perception), on the one hand, and the
non-natural scientific world-view (and the observations on which it is
based), on the other hand, is the difference between the roles of
things and obtaining states of affairs. In the former things are
prominent, in the latter facts are prominent (Scheler
c.1911&ndash;1912).</p>

<p>
Facts as obtaining states of affairs might well be dubbed
&ldquo;Austrian facts&rdquo; or &ldquo;A-Facts&rdquo;, since Husserl,
Meinong and Wittgenstein were Austrian philosophers (Morscher
1986).</p>

<p>
One of the two most careful accounts of obtaining states of affairs in
the tradition which begins with Husserl and Meinong is that given by
the German philosopher, Reinach, in 1911 and later. States of affairs,
Reinach argues, are either positive or negative, particular or
general, contingent or non-contingent and either obtain or do not
obtain. Propositions, unlike states of affairs, are true or false. If
a state of affairs does not obtain, then the contradictorily opposed
state of affairs obtains. The concept of a state of affairs, like that
of a process, is indefinable. Objects, (non-repeatable) properties and
relations are &ldquo;elements&rdquo; or &ldquo;members&rdquo; of
states of affairs. But not all states of affairs contain objects; an
impersonal state of affairs such as the obtaining state of affairs
that it is raining does not contain objects. Logic is in the first
place the logic of states of affairs and only secondarily the logic of
propositions. The logic of propositions is grounded in the logic of
states of affairs. Reinach&rsquo;s philosophy of states of affairs,
then, is about as baroque as such a philosophy can be. Like Husserl
and Meinong, he argues that states of affairs are the primary bearers
of modality and that obtaining states of affairs are what explain and
what is explained (Reinach 1911 [1982]; cf. Smith 1989, Meixner 1997).
Like Husserl, Meinong and Wittgenstein, he distinguishes between the
existence of complexes and their parts, on the one hand, and the
obtaining of states of affairs. Reinach&rsquo;s defense of obtaining
negative states of affairs and Russell&rsquo;s defense of negative
facts were both made public in 1911. Reinach&rsquo;s defense is
examined and rejected by another realist phenomenologist, Ingarden
(Ingarden 1965: &sect;53), the author of the second of the two most
careful accounts of obtaining states of affairs in the
phenomenological tradition. Whereas Husserl and Reinach thought of
things, processes, states and punctual events as ontologically more
fundamental than facts, Ingarden argues that processes and punctual
events can be constructed out of states of affairs, objects,
properties and relations.</p>

<p>
Many phenomenologists and pupils of Meinong claim in passing that
obtaining states of affairs or their ilk are what make truth-bearers
true (just as many Cambridge philosophers, from Stout to McTaggart,
claim in passing that facts as exemplifications make truth-bearers
true). But the first explicit theory of truthmaking is given by the
German realist phenomenologist, Pf&auml;nder, in 1921. According to
Pf&auml;nder, every true truth-bearer is made true by the obtaining of
a state of affairs. This principle of factualist, truthmaker
maximalism is itself, he argues, grounded in the essences of
truth-bearers and of truth&mdash;and of all this we have <em>a
priori</em> knowledge (Pf&auml;nder 1921, Mulligan 2006a).</p>

<p>
Husserl initially claimed that truth-bearers and judgings represent
states of affairs. But as he became impressed by the argument that,
for example, neither the judgment nor the proposition that Sam is sad
employ the concept of state of affairs (or the concept of truth) he
came round to the view that obtaining states of affairs make
propositions true and judgments correct but are not properly speaking
represented by these. Every truth-bearer &ldquo;corresponds&rdquo; to
but does not represent a state of affairs, every state of affairs
&ldquo;belongs to&rdquo; a proposition and either obtains or does not
obtain (Husserl 1913; Husserl <em>LU</em> [1973: Prolegomena &sect;6,
I &sect;12]; Husserl <em>Logic</em> 1902/1903 [2001]).</p>

<p>
Many pupils of Husserl, such as Reinach, as well as Wittgenstein,
Carnap and Searle endorse versions of the view that truth-bearers
represent or stand in some other semantic relation to states of
affairs (Wittgenstein TLP 4.1, 4.022; Carnap 1959; Searle 1983).</p>

<p>
Russell examines the view that to judge that <em>p</em> is to stand in
a relation to an objective which may or may not obtain or exist in
1910 and rejects the view (Russell 1910 [1976]). In the same year, in
<em>Principia Mathematica</em>, Whitehead and Russell (1910: 44) claim
that &ldquo;an <em>elementary</em> judgment is true when there is a
corresponding complex, and false when there is no corresponding
complex&rdquo;; a complex is any such object as &ldquo;<em>a</em>
having the quality <em>q</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>a</em> and
<em>b</em> and <em>c</em> standing in the relation <em>S</em>&rdquo;;
it is anything which occurs in the universe and is not simple. 1910 is
also the year in which the view that facts are obtaining states of
affairs found one early friend in England: Stout argues that in true
judgment there must be an agreement with some reality the mind intends
or means; what is before the mind is &ldquo;a possible
alternative&rdquo; and &ldquo;what is required to make the judgment
true is the identity of this with the actualised alternative&rdquo;,
an &ldquo;actual fact&rdquo; (Stout 1910&ndash;1911).</p>

<p>
The Austrian philosopher G. Bergmann initially defended the view that
facts are what are here called exemplifications and later the view
that there are actual and potential facts (Bergmann 1992; on
Bergmann&rsquo;s different views and some rivals, see Tegtmeier 1992,
Hochberg 2001).</p>

<h3>4. Medieval Facts</h3>

<p>
Investigation of medieval accounts of what it is to be a state of
affairs (<em>status rerum</em>), of states of affairs which exist, of
states of affairs as bearers of modalities, of facts and of entities
which, from the point of view of many twentieth century philosophies,
combine properties of states of affairs, of propositions and of
sentence meanings, is in its infancy (&Eacute;lie 1937; Smith 1992;
Olson 1987: ch. 2; Perler 1994; Berger 1999; Schmutz 2002; Cesalli 2007). Uses of
&ldquo;<em>Sachverhalt</em>&rdquo; (state of affairs) as a technical
term at the end of the nineteenth century by J. Bergmann and Stumpf
were anticipated by German works on medieval philosophy, as Oliver
Seidl (personal communication) has pointed out. Thus in a 1859 account
of Aquinas, Karl Werner refers to correct and incorrect assertion and
denial as &ldquo;what corresponds or does not correspond to the state
of affairs occurring (<em>statthabend</em>) in reality&rdquo; (Werner
1859: 37&ndash;8).</p>

<h3>5. Aristotelian Facts</h3>

<p>
For the view that Aristotle countenanced states of affairs, see Simons
1988 and Crivelli 2004.</p>

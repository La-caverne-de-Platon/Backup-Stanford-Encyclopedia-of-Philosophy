<h2>The De Re/De Dicto Distinction</h2>

<p>
Propositional attitude verbs are <em>opacity inducing</em>. That is,
they seem to create linguistic environments that do not permit
substitution of co-designating singular terms <em>salva veritate</em>.
This is the basis of Frege&rsquo;s puzzle. Modals like &lsquo;it is
necessary that&rsquo; and &lsquo;it is possible that&rsquo; are also
opacity inducing. Opacity inducing expressions give rise to a <em>de
re/de dicto</em> distinction. The <em>de re/de dicto</em> distinction
has meant different things to different people. Below we&rsquo;ll
distinguish three different conceptions of this distinction, the first
two concerning the status of sentences and the third being more
metaphysical. We begin by motivating the distinction.</p>

<p>
W. V. Quine, in his 1956, pointed out an ambiguity in (1) below.</p>

<blockquote>
(1) Ralph believes that someone is a spy.
</blockquote>

<p>
(1) could mean either of the following.</p>

<blockquote>
(2) Ralph believes that there are spies
</blockquote>

<p>
or</p>

<blockquote>
(3) Someone is such that Ralph believes that s/he is a spy.
</blockquote>

<p>
The truth of (3) but not (2), to echo Quine, would give the FBI cause
to be interested in Ralph. We might paraphrase (3) as follows:
&ldquo;Someone is such that Ralph believes of that person that s/he is
a spy.&rdquo; The distinction between (2) and (3) can be seen as a
distinction of scope for the existential quantifier. In (2), the
existential quantifier is interpreted as having narrow scope,
occurring within the scope of &lsquo;believes&rsquo;, which we can
represent with the following hybrid sentences.</p>

<blockquote>
(2*) Ralph believes: &exist;<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> is a spy).
</blockquote>

<p>
In (3), however, the existential quantifier has wide scope and binds a
variable that occurs freely within the scope of &lsquo;believes&rsquo;
and so binds across the attitude verb.</p>

<blockquote>
(3*) &exist;<em>x</em>(Ralph believes that <em>x</em> is a spy).
</blockquote>

<p>
Russell&rsquo;s theory of definite descriptions employs just such a
distinction in answering Frege&rsquo;s puzzles about belief.</p>

<p>
The same distinction can be found with both modals and temporal
modifiers. (4) below is ambiguous between (4n) and (4w).</p>

<blockquote>
(4) The shortest spy might not have been/was not a spy.

<p>
(4n) It is possible/was the case that: the shortest spy is not a
spy.</p>

<p>
(4w) The shortest spy is such that it is possible the case that s/he
is not a spy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
(4n) is false; necessarily, any spy such that no spy is shorter than
that person is a spy. But presumably (4w) is true; the person who in
fact is shortest of all spies might not have gone into espionage and
surely wasn&rsquo;t born into the business.</p>

<p>
This very natural and elegant explanation of the ambiguity in (1)
leads us to the first conception of the <em>de re/de dicto</em>
distinction.</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Syntactically <em>de re</em>/<em>de dicto</em></strong>:
<br />
A sentence is <em>syntactically de re</em> just in case it contains a
pronoun or free variable within the scope of an opacity verb that is
anaphoric on or bound by a singular term or quantifier outside the
scope of that verb. Otherwise, it is <em>syntactically de dicto</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
So, (2) and its quasi-formalization (2*) are syntactically <em>de
dicto</em> because the quantifier &lsquo;someone&rsquo; occurs within
the scope of &lsquo;believes&rsquo; along with the variable it binds.
(3) and its quasi-formalization (3*), on the other hand, are
syntactically <em>de re</em> because the quantifier
&lsquo;someone&rsquo; occurs outside the scope of
&lsquo;believes&rsquo; and yet binds a variable within its scope.
Similarly, (5) and (6) below are syntactically <em>de dicto</em> while
(7) and (8) are syntactically <em>de re</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
(5) Sally believes that Bill is happy.

<p>
(6) Sally believes that someone is happy.</p>

<p>
(7) Bill is such that Sally believes that he is happy.</p>

<p>
(8) Someone is such that Sally believes that he is happy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In his 1956, Quine rejects this simple account of the different
readings of (1) because it involves <em>quantifying into opaque
environments</em>, which Quine thought was incoherent. In particular,
making sense of one reading of (1) in terms of (3) and (3*) requires
making sense of quantifying in, which Quine maintained could not be
done without changing the meaning of the quantifier or the attitude
verb.</p>

<p>
On the standard semantics for quantification, the interpretation of
(3*) requires making sense of an individual satisfying the open
sentence &lsquo;Ralph believes that <em>x</em> is a spy&rsquo;. This
is because the standard semantics for quantification is objectual: A
quantified sentence &exist;<em>x</em><em>&Phi;x</em> is true just in
case there is an object that satisfies <em>&Phi;x</em>. Quine thought
that this leads to contradiction when the open sentence contains an
opacity-inducing expression like &lsquo;believes&rsquo;. He thought
this largely because of considerations involving Frege-style cases.
Quine&rsquo;s arguments follow his earlier arguments against
quantified modal logic (see, for example, Quine 1980).</p>

<p>
Quine thought that (3*) is non-sense because he thought it is
incoherent to say of some individual &ndash; Ortcutt, let&rsquo;s say
&ndash; that the open sentence &lsquo;Ralph believes that he is a
spy&rsquo; is true of him. He thought this, in turn, for the following
reason. Suppose that Ralph knows of Ortcutt under two guises. Under
one &ndash; say, the mayor of the town guise &ndash; Ralph thinks of
him as the town pillar who would hardly engage in espionage. Under the
other &ndash; say, the guy he saw sneaking around in the shadows at
night in a trench coat &ndash; he thinks of him as a suspicious
character engaged in espionage. Let&rsquo;s associate the first with
the term &lsquo;Mayor&rsquo; and the second with the term &lsquo;he
[pointing at the man in the dark]&rsquo;. (9) below seems true while
(10) seems false.</p>

<blockquote>
(9) Ralph believes that he [pointing at the man in the dark] is a spy.

<p>
(10) Ralph believes that Mayor is a spy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But then whether or not Ortcutt satisfies the open formula
&lsquo;Ralph believes that <em>&Phi;x</em> is a spy&rsquo; depends on
how Ortcutt is designated. In particular, Ortcutt satisfies the
formula when designated as &lsquo;he [pointing at the man in the
dark]&rsquo; and doesn&rsquo;t satisfy the formula when designated as
&lsquo;Mayor&rsquo;. But the notion of an individual satisfying an
open sentence is not sensitive to how that individual is designated;
the notion of satisfaction is a direct relation between object and
condition not mediated by designations of the individual. So, Quine
concluded, it is simply non-sense to say that Ortcutt himself,
independent of a way of designating him, satisfies or doesn&rsquo;t
satisfy the condition. But then, given the standard objectual
semantics for quantification, (3*) is nonsense, as it is objects
themselves, however or even whether they are designated, that satisfy
or do not satisfy conditions. So, says Quine, we should abandon the
attractive project of making sense of the two readings (1) gives rise
to in terms of a difference in scope and in terms of the syntactic
conception of the <em>de re</em>/<em>de dicto</em> distinction.</p>

<p>
We&rsquo;ll return to this argument shortly. First, however,
let&rsquo;s introduce our second conception of the <em>de re/de
dicto</em> distinction. We shall call it &ldquo;the semantically
<em>de re/de dicto</em> distinction.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Semantically <em>de re</em>/<em>de dicto</em></strong>:
<br />
A sentence is <em>semantically de re</em> just in case it permits
substitution of co-designating terms <em>salva veritate</em>.
Otherwise, it is <em>semantically de dicto</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
(7) from above non-controversially counts as semantically <em>de
re</em>. Suppose that Bill is Sally&rsquo;s brother. Then (7) is true
iff (11) below is true.</p>

<blockquote>
(11) Sally&rsquo;s brother is such that Sally believes that he is
happy.
</blockquote>

<p>
The truth of (11) does not require that Sally conceive of the object
of her belief as her brother. For example, if Sally is watching a
person across the room laughing who happens to be her brother,
although unbeknownst to Sally, and says to herself, &ldquo;He
[pointing at the laughing man] is happy,&rdquo; then (11) is true. (6)
is non-controversially semantically <em>de dicto</em>. Similarly, it
is all but non-controversial that (12) below is semantically <em>de
dicto</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
(12) Sally believes that the happy guy in the corner is happy.
</blockquote>

<p>
Even though Sally&rsquo;s brother is the happy guy in the corner, (13)
below doesn&rsquo;t seem to follow from the truth of (12), as Sally
does not conceptualize the person she sees in the corner as her
brother.</p>

<blockquote>
(13) Sally believes that her brother is happy.
</blockquote>

<p>
What about a sentence like (5) from above, which we categorized as
syntactically <em>de dicto</em>? Is that sentence semantically <em>de
re</em> or semantically <em>de dicto</em>? In general, what is the
relationship between the syntactic conception and the semantic
conception? If Fregeanism is true, then every syntactically <em>de
dicto</em> sentence is semantically <em>de dicto</em> as well. On
Frege&rsquo;s own view, remember, attitude verbs induce a reference
shift. Furthermore, a large part of the motivation for accepting a
sense/reference distinction for singular terms is to ensure that
substitution on the basis of an ordinary co-reference relation fails
within the scope of an attitude verb. So, any syntactically <em>de
dicto</em> sentence should be one that does not permit, without
further assumptions, substitution and hence is semantically <em>de
dicto</em> as well.</p>

<p>
Sophisticated forms of Russellianism (see section 6 on Contextualist
theories in the main text) yield a similar result. Substitution within
the scope of an attitude verb is, in general, not permitted and hence
any syntactically <em>de dicto</em> sentence will be semantically
<em>de dicto</em> for the reasons given above.</p>

<p>
But what if Naive Russellianism is true? (See 
 <a href="index-2.html#NaiRusThe">Section 4</a>
 in the main text.) Suppose that both proper names and demonstratively
used pronouns are directly referential. And suppose that Naive
Russellianism is true. Then (5) from above is true if and only if (14)
below is true. </p>

<blockquote>
(14) Sally believes that he [pointing at the laughing man] is happy.
</blockquote>

<p>
That is because both &lsquo;Bill&rsquo; and &lsquo;he [pointing at the
laughing man]&rsquo; refer to the same person, Bill, and Sally stands
in the believing relation to the singular proposition that Bill/he
[pointing at the laughing man] is happy.</p>

<p>
Now suppose that definite descriptions are singular terms and suppose
that they function roughly as Russell says they do. (We say roughly
because Russell thought that definite descriptions are not singular
terms. For more on Russell&rsquo;s theory of definite descriptions,
see the entry on
 <a href="../descriptions/index.html">descriptions</a>.
 Our thought is that one can agree with the Russellian truth
conditions for sentences with definite descriptions while insisting
that definite descriptions are singular terms and do not break up
under analysis.) Then the fact that Bill is Sally&rsquo;s brother
together with the truth of both (5) and (14) do not suffice for the
truth of (13) from above. That is because, even though
&lsquo;Bill&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sally&rsquo;s brother&rsquo; have a
common designation, &lsquo;Sally&rsquo;s brother&rsquo; is not a
directly referential expression and so the embedded sentences
&lsquo;Bill is happy&rsquo; and &lsquo;Sally&rsquo;s brother is
happy&rsquo; express different propositions, the first of which Sally
stands in the belief relation to, as she accepts &lsquo;He [pointing
at the laughing man] is happy&rsquo;, while the second she does not.
The truth of (13) requires that Sally believes true a proposition to
the effect that whoever is uniquely at a brother of Sally is
happy.</p>

<p>
The upshot is that some syntactically <em>de dicto</em> sentences,
like (5) and (13) semantically <em>de re</em> and entail and are
entailed by their syntactically <em>de re</em> counterparts, in the
sense that (5) is true if and only if (7) is true. But other
syntactically <em>de dicto</em> sentences, like (13), are not entail
by their semantically <em>de re</em> counterparts. More precisely, if
Naive Russellianism is true, then, for any syntactically <em>de
dicto</em> propositional attitude containing embedded sentences with
directly referential expression, that same sentence is semantically
<em>de re</em> and both entails and is entailed by its syntactically
<em>de re</em> counterpart. These connections are not guaranteed when
the syntactically <em>de dicto</em> propositional attitude sentence
contains an embedded sentence with a nondirectly referential
expression in subject position. This is a bit surprising but, we
think, perfectly acceptable.</p>

<p>
We can go a step further in drawing relating the different
conceptions. Naive Russellianism, and perhaps neo-Russellianism in
general, seems to give rise to a very interesting form of reduction of
the <em>de re</em> to the <em>de dicto</em>. On some conceptions of
the reduction of the <em>de re</em> to the <em>de dicto</em>, all
<em>de re</em> beliefs involve completely conceptualized beliefs.
(See, for example, Kaplan 1969, Chisholm 1976, and Sosa 1970. Kaplan
abandoned the view in his later work.) The neo-Russellian is not
likely to embrace this sort of reduction. But there is a less
ambitious reduction that she may well find congenial: Namely, for any
true <em>de re</em> reporting sentence, there is a true <em>de
dicto</em> reporting sentence. This is because the <em>de re</em> and
<em>de dicto</em> reporting sentences will report the very same
belief, as is witnessed by the Naive Russellian view of the
relationship between (5) and (7). Believing that Bill is happy just
is, on this view, believing of Bill, who happens to be the person
Sally demonstrated while saying to herself, &lsquo;He [pointing at the
laughing man] is happy&rsquo;, that he is happy. Both (5) and (7),
that is, report belief in the same singular proposition. (For a
suggestion of the relationship between neo-Russellianism and the
reduction of the <em>de re</em>, see Kaplan 1986; for more details,
see Salmon 1995, 1997.) If this view is correct, then we can see that
Quine&rsquo;s argument against the natural and elegant account of the
ambiguity we found in (1) that we opened with above fails.</p>

<p>
Let us return to our discussion of Quine. Quine rejects, remember,
(3*). But he does not deny that there is an intuitive distinction
between two ways of reading (1) that the simple Russell-inspired
account in terms of (2) and (3) is trying to get at. Quine offered an
account of that intuitive distinction in terms of a lexical ambiguity
in &lsquo;believes&rsquo; (and other propositional attitude verbs).
(The Russell-inspired account considered above makes sense of the
distinction as a syntactic ambiguity of scope.) There is, first, the
two-place relation <em>believes-notional</em>, which is a relation
between an agent and a proposition. (Quine, in section 4 of his 1956,
went on to eliminate <em>propositional</em> attitudes in terms of
<em>believing-true</em> a sentence. See the discussion of
sententialism in the section Denying the assumption of
structured-propositionalism in the main text.) In addition, there is
an irreducible three-place relation <em>believes-relational</em>,
which obtains between an agent, an object, and an abstract. If Quine
were right, there would be no reducibility thesis of any kind between
the semantically <em>de re</em> and the semantically <em>de
dicto</em>. Burge, in his 1977a/b, agrees with Quine on this
score.</p>

<p>
Although it may be tempting to think of the ambiguity uncovered in (1)
as an ambiguity in the verb &lsquo;believe&rsquo;, positing lexical
ambiguities to explain the data is unnecessary, as we have seen above
in our discussion of neo-Russellianism. And there have also been
Fregean account of the distinction offered in Kaplan 1969 and Forbes
1996 that do not require positing a lexical ambiguity. Given the
dictum that lexical ambiguities should be invoked only when necessary,
this calls into question the Quinean account of the two readings of
(1).</p>

<p>
There is a final conception of the <em>de re/de dicto</em> distinction
that is worth briefly considering. We shall label it the metaphysical
conception of the <em>de re/de dicto</em> distinction. This conception
of the distinction concerns the role a given object plays in the truth
of a sentence. This conception of the distinction is best brought out
by contrasting the simple theory of predication that forms the basis
of standard predicate logic with quotation. In standard predicate
logic, an <em>n</em>-place predicate is interpreted by being assigned
a set of <em>n</em>-tuples of individuals from the domain of
discourse; intuitively, the set of <em>n</em>-tuples to which the
predicate applies. An atomic sentence of the form &Phi;&alpha; is true
in an interpretation just in case the value of &alpha; in that
interpretation is in the extension of &Phi;x in that interpretation.
Contrast this with the relationship between ordinary objects and
quotation. The truth of (15) below does not directly involve Henry
himself but instead the name &lsquo;Henry&rsquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
(15) &lsquo;Henry&rsquo; has 5 letters.
</blockquote>

<p>
At best Henry is indirectly, if at all, involved in the truth of (15)
in virtue of his having a name (namely, the name &lsquo;Henry&rsquo;)
that has the attribute of having 5 letters. Here, it is the name, not
Henry himself, that is the direct object of predication.</p>

<p>
With this in mind, we can formulate our third conception of the de
re/de dicto distinction as follows.</p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Metaphysically <em>de re</em>/<em>de dicto</em></strong>:
<br />
An attribution is metaphysically <em>de re</em> with respect to an
object <strong>o</strong> just in case it directly attributes a
property to <strong>o</strong>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Are belief attributions metaphysically <em>de re</em>? While it seems
clear that a sentence like (5) is metaphysically <em>de re</em> with
respect to Sally, is there also a sense in which it is metaphysically
<em>de re</em> with respect to Bill, the object of Sally&rsquo;s
belief? And how does our third conception of the <em>de re</em> relate
to the other two conceptions introduced earlier? The answers to these
questions differ depending on the theory of belief attributions one
adopts.</p>

<p>
Suppose that an attribution is metaphysically <em>de re</em> with
respect to <strong>o</strong>. Then the expression in the attribution
that designates <strong>o</strong> should be open to substitution and
hence the attribution is semantically <em>de re</em> as well. For
suppose it were not. Then the truth of the attribution would depend on
how the object is designated. But then whether or not the attribution
is true would not depend solely on how the object itself is and so the
attribution would not be metaphysically <em>de re</em>.</p>

<p>
Suppose that Sally believes that Bill is happy. Does it thereby follow
that Bill himself has a property &ndash; namely, the property of being
believed by Sally to be happy? Neo-Russellians say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo;
for reasons discussed above: Namely, Sally&rsquo;s believing that Bill
is happy involves Sally&rsquo;s standing in the belief relation to a
singular proposition that involves Bill himself as a direct
constituent. Those that reject neo-Russellianism, however, answer
&ldquo;no.&rdquo; This is because Sally&rsquo;s belief, which is truly
reported by (5), does not involve Bill himself but rather mode of
presentation of Bill. Bill himself is at best indirectly implicated in
the truth of (5), by being determined by the mode of presentation in
question.</p>

<p>
Claiming that belief attributions are not metaphysically <em>de
re</em> is problem, for the following reasons. Suppose that Sally has
reason to believe, on purely general grounds, that there is exactly
one person at Disneyland and that whoever is at Disneyland is a happy
person. Then (16) below seems true. </p>

<blockquote>
(16) Sally believes that the person at Disneyland is happy.
</blockquote>

<p>
Suppose now that Bill is the person at Disneyland. In this case,
although in some sense it is Bill that Sally believes to be happy, in
that she believes true a proposition that is about Bill in virtue of
his satisfying the condition of uniquely being at Disneyland, it is
intuitive that Bill himself does not have the property of being
believed by Sally to be happy and that Bill himself does not directly
factor into Sally&rsquo;s cognitive state. So, the truth of (16) does
not entail a metaphysically <em>de re</em> attribution to Bill. This
is in contrast to the case in which Brenda&rsquo;s grounds for
believing that the person at Disneyland is happy is her having spied
on Bill from her hotel room, witnessing and cognizing Bill&rsquo;s
rapture while in the happiest place of earth. Then it is plausible
that Brenda has a <em>de re</em> belief of Bill to the effect that he
is happy.</p>

<p>
Consider now (17).</p>

<blockquote>
(17) The person at Disneyland is such that Sally believes that he is
happy.
</blockquote>

<p>
(17) is syntactically <em>de re</em>, non-controversially allows
substitution, and hence is semantically <em>de re</em> as well.
Intuitively the truth of (17), combined with the fact that Bill is the
person at Disneyland, entails (7). (17) and (7) do seem to be
metaphysically <em>de re</em> with respect to Bill. The challenge is
to explain why (16) entails neither (17) nor (7).</p>

<p>
A plausible answer is this. The truth of (17) and (7) require that
Sally stand in the belief relation to a singular proposition involving
Bill himself as a direct constituent. But (16) can be true even if
Sally believes no such proposition. The truth of (16) requires only
that Sally stand in the belief relation to a purely general
proposition to the effect that there is someone who uniquely is at
Disneyland and that person is happy, a proposition both the grasping
and adequate justification for believing of which does not require any
cognitive relations to Bill in particular. In the situation described,
Sally is only in a position to entertain a general proposition about
Bill and not the singular proposition that would support the truth of
(17) and (7). More generally, a designating term within the
that-clause is open to exportation, transforming a syntactically
<em>de dicto</em> propositional attitude ascription into a
semantically and metaphysically <em>de re</em> one, precisely when
that expression is directly referential, as grasping the content of
such an expression requires a real cognitive relation to its
referent.</p>

<p>
This is an answer that only a neo-Russellian is in a position to
offer. This is because it presupposes that singular propositions are
the contents of the attitudes. One serious problem facing those who
reject neo-Russellianism is to explain the intuition that (16) does
not entail (17). While a complete survey of the options is out of the
question here, it seems that there are two main options. The first is
to reject the intuition, claiming that (16) does entail (17). This is
to accept a form of <em>latitudinarianism</em> about <em>de re</em>
attitudes, according to which (nonempty) designating terms within
propositional attitude verbs freely export outside the scope of
propositional attitude verbs. (Defenses of this view can be found in
Baker 1982, Chisholm 1976, and Sosa 1970, 1995.) This view does not
comport well with the intuition that there is an important difference
between the cognitive states of Sally and Brenda. The second option is
to accept that (16) does not entail (17) and seek to provide an
account of the conditions under which such an entailment obtains,
consistent with the thesis that the contents of thought are always
fully conceptualized and Fregean. Kaplan 1969 develops the best
version of this option. He asks whether Ralph&rsquo;s believing that
the shortest spy is a spy on the grounds that there are finitely many
spies and none of them have exactly the same height suffices for
Ralph&rsquo;s having a <em>de re</em> belief concerning the shortest
spy that he is a spy. Kaplan claims that it does not, thus agreeing
that an inference like that of (17) from (16) is not generally valid.
Kaplan went on to complicate his simple account of <em>de re</em>
belief by requiring <em>vivid</em> names <em>of</em> the object of
belief in order for a term to export outside the scope of an attitude
verb. The requirements of <em>of</em>-ness and <em>vividness</em>,
however, or any other condition of their kind, seem contrary to
Fregeanism, as such notions seem to suggest a distinction between
directly referential and descriptive terms and involve direct
cognitive relations between the mind and external reality, which leads
to some form of Russellianism. One can find, then, the seeds of
Kaplan&rsquo;s ultimate anti-Fregeanism already present in his robust
defense of a Fregean account of quantifying in and <em>de re</em>
belief.</p>

<p>
The issues involving the <em>de re/de dicto</em> distinction are very
complex. In this short note we have distinguished three different
conceptions of that distinction. Exactly how these different
conceptions line up is controversial. We have tried to explore some
connections one might forge between the view one takes on the nature
of propositional attitudes and one&rsquo;s conception of the <em>de
re/de dicto</em> distinction.</p>

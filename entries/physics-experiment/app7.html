<h2>Appendix 7: Evidence for a New Entity: J.J. Thomson and the Electron</h2>

<p>

In discussing the existence of electrons Ian Hacking has written,
&ldquo;So far as I&rsquo;m concerned, if you can spray them then they are real&rdquo;
(Hacking 1983, p. 23). He went on to elaborate this view. &ldquo;We are
completely convinced of the reality of electrons when we set out to
build&mdash;and often enough succeed in building&mdash;new kinds of device that
use various well-understood causal properties of electrons to interfere
in other more hypothetical parts of nature&rdquo; (p. 265).</p>

<p>

Hacking worried that the simple manipulation of the first quotation,
the changing of the charge on an oil drop or on a superconducting
niobium sphere, which involves only the charge of the electron, was
insufficient grounds for belief in electrons. His second illustration,
which he believed more convincing because it involved several
properties of the electron, was that of Peggy II, a source of polarized
electrons built at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in the late
1970s. Peggy II provided polarized electrons for an experiment that
scattered electrons off deuterium to investigate the weak neutral
current. Although I agree with Hacking that manipulability can often
provide us with grounds for belief in a theoretical
 entity,<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A7-1" id="note-A7-1">1</a>]</sup>
 his illustration comes far too
late. Physicists were manipulating the electron in Hacking&rsquo;s sense in
the early twentieth
 century.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A7-2" id="note-A7-2">2</a>]</sup>
 They believed in the existence of
electrons well before Peggy II, and I will argue that they had good
reasons for that
 belief.</p>

<p>

The position I adopt is one that might reasonably be called
&ldquo;conjectural&rdquo; realism. It is conjectural because, despite having good
reasons for belief in the existence of an entity or in the truth of a
scientific law, we might be wrong. At one time scientists had good
reason to believe in phlogiston and caloric, substances we now have
good reason to believe don&rsquo;t exist. My position includes both Sellars&rsquo;
view that &ldquo;to have good reason for holding a theory is <em>ipso
facto</em> to have good reason for holding that the entities postulated
by the theory exist&rdquo; (Sellars 1962, p. 97), and the &ldquo;entity realism&rdquo;
proposed by Cartwright (1983) and by Hacking (1983). Both Hacking, as
noted above, and Cartwright emphasize the manipulability of an entity
as a criterion for belief in its existence. Cartwright also stresses
causal reasoning as part of her belief in entities. In her discussion
of the operation of a cloud chamber she states, &ldquo;&hellip;if there are no
electrons in the cloud chamber, I do not know why the tracks are there&rdquo;
(Cartwright, 1983, p.99). In other words, if such entities don&rsquo;t exist
then we have no plausible causal story to tell. Both Hacking and
Cartwright grant existence to entities such as electrons, but do not
grant &ldquo;real&rdquo; status to either laws or theories, which may postulate or
apply to such entities.</p>

<p>

In contrast to both Cartwright and Hacking, I suggest that we can
also have good reasons for belief in the laws and theories governing
the behavior of the entities, and that several of their illustrations
implicitly involve such
 laws.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A7-3" id="note-A7-3">3</a>]</sup>
 I have argued elsewhere for belief
in the reality of scientific laws (Franklin 1996). In this section I
shall concentrate on the reality and existence of entities, in
particular, the electron. I agree with both Hacking and Cartwright that
we can go beyond Sellars and have good reasons for belief in entities
even without laws. Hacking and Cartwright emphasize experimenting
<em>with</em> entities. I will argue that experimenting <em>on</em>
entities and measuring their properties can also provide grounds for
belief in their existence.</p>

<p>

In this section I will discuss the grounds for belief in the
existence of the electron by examining J.J. Thomson&rsquo;s experiments on
cathode rays. His 1897 experiment on cathode rays is generally regarded
as the &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; of the electron.</p>

<p>

The purpose of J.J. Thomson&rsquo;s experiments was clearly stated in the
introduction to his 1897 paper.</p>

<p>

The experiments discussed in this paper were undertaken in the hope
of gaining some information as to the nature of Cathode Rays. The most
diverse opinions are held as to these rays; according to the almost
unanimous opinion of German physicists they are due to some process in
the aether to which&mdash;inasmuch as in a uniform magnetic field their
course is circular and not rectilinear&mdash;no phenomenon hitherto
observed is analogous: another view of these rays is that, so far from
being wholly aetherial, they are in fact wholly material, and that they
mark the paths of particles of matter charged with negative electricity
(Thomson 1897, p. 293).</p>

<p>

Thomson&rsquo;s first order of business was to show that the cathode rays
carried negative charge. This had presumably been shown previously by
Perrin. Perrin placed two coaxial metal cylinders, insulated from one
another, in front of a plane cathode. The cylinders each had a small
hole through which the cathode rays could pass onto the inner cylinder.
The outer cylinder was grounded. When cathode rays passed into the
inner cylinder an electroscope attached to it showed the presence of a
negative electrical charge. When the cathode rays were magnetically
deflected so that they did not pass through the holes, no charge was
detected. &ldquo;Now the supporters of the aetherial theory do not deny that
electrified particles are shot off from the cathode; they deny,
however, that these charged particles have any more to do with the
cathode rays than a rifle-ball has with the flash when a rifle is
fired&rdquo; (Thomson 1897, p. 294).</p>

<p>

Thomson repeated the experiment, but in a form that was not open to
that objection. The apparatus is shown in Figure 14.
The two coaxial cylinders with
holes are shown. The outer cylinder was grounded and the inner one
attached to an electrometer to detect any charge. The cathode rays from
A pass into the bulb, but would not enter the holes in the cylinders
unless deflected by a magnetic field.</p>

<p><span class="figlabel">Figure 14.</span>

have negative charge. The slits in the cylinders are shown. From
Thomson (1897).
</p>
</div>

<p>

When the cathode rays (whose path was traced by the phosphorescence
on the glass) did not fall on the slit, the electrical charge sent to
the electrometer when the induction coil producing the rays was set in
action was small and irregular; when, however, the rays were bent by a
magnet so as to fall on the slit there was a large charge of negative
electricity sent to the electrometer&hellip;. If the rays were so much bent
by the magnet that they overshot the slits in the cylinder, the charge
passing into the cylinder fell again to a very small fraction of its
value when the aim was true. <em>Thus this experiment shows that
however we twist and deflect the cathode rays by magnetic forces, the
negative electrification follows the same path as the rays, and that
this negative electrification is indissolubly connected with the
cathode rays</em> (Thomson 1897, p. 294&ndash;295, emphasis added).</p>

<p>

This experiment also demonstrated that cathode rays were deflected
by a magnetic field in exactly the way one would expect if they were
negatively charged material
 particles.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A7-4" id="note-A7-4">4</a>]</sup></p>

are deflected by an electric field. It was also used to measure
\(\bfrac{m}{e}\). From Thomson (1897).
</p>
</div>

<p>

There was, however, a problem for the view that cathode rays were
negatively charged particles. Several experiments, in particular those
of Hertz, had failed to observe the deflection of cathode rays by an
electrostatic field. Thomson proceeded to answer this objection. His
apparatus is shown in Figure 15. Cathode
rays from C pass through a slit in the anode A, and through another
slit at B. They then passed between plates D and E and produced a
narrow well-defined phosphorescent patch at the end of the tube, which
also had a scale attached to measure any deflection. When Hertz had
performed the experiment he had found no deflection when a potential
difference was applied across D and E. He concluded that the
electrostatic properties of the cathode ray are either <em>nil</em> or
very feeble. Thomson admitted that when he first performed the
experiment he also saw no effect. &ldquo;on repeating this experiment [that
of Hertz] I at first got the same result [no deflection], but
subsequent experiments showed that the absence of deflexion is due to
the conductivity conferred on the rarefied gas by the cathode
 rays&rdquo;.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A7-5" id="note-A7-5">5</a>]</sup>
 On measuring this
conductivity it was found that it diminished very rapidly as the
exhaustion increased; it seemed that on trying Hertz&rsquo;s experiment at
very high exhaustion there might be a chance of detecting the deflexion
of the cathode rays by an electrostatic force (Thomson 1897, p. 296).
Thomson did perform the experiment at lower pressure [higher
exhaustion] and observed the
 deflection.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A7-6" id="note-A7-6">6</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Thomson concluded:</p>

<blockquote>As the cathode rays carry a charge of negative electricity,
are deflected by an electrostatic force as if they were negatively
electrified, and are acted on by a magnetic force in just the way in
which this force would act on a negatively electrified body moving
along the path of these rays, I can see no escape from the conclusion
that they are charges of negative electricity carried by particles of
matter. (Thomson 1897, p.
 302)<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A7-7" id="note-A7-7">7</a>]</sup></blockquote>

<p>

Having established that cathode rays were negatively charged
material particles, Thomson went on to discuss what the particles were.
&ldquo;What are these particles? are they atoms, or molecules, or matter in a
still finer state of subdivision&rdquo; (p. 302). To investigate this
question Thomson made measurements on the charge to mass ratio of
cathode rays. Thomson&rsquo;s method used both the electrostatic and magnetic
deflection of the cathode
 rays.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A7-8" id="note-A7-8">8</a>]</sup>
The apparatus is shown in Figure 15. It also included a magnetic field
that could be created perpendicular to both the electric field and the
trajectory of the cathode rays.</p>

<p>

Let us consider a beam of particles of mass \(m\) charge
\(e\), and velocity \(v\). Suppose the beam passes through an
electric field F in the region between plates D and E, which has a
length \(L\). The time for a particle to pass through this region
\(t = \bfrac{L}{v}\). The electric force on the particle is
\(Fe\) and its acceleration \(a = \bfrac{Fe}{m}\). The deflection d at
the end of the region is given by</p>

\[
d = \frac{1}{2} at^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{eF}{m}\right)\frac{L^2}{v^{2}}.
\]

<p>

Now consider a situation in which the beam of cathode rays
simultaneously pass through both \(F\) and a magnetic field
\(B\) in the same region. Thomson adjusted \(B\) so that the
beam was undeflected. thus the magnetic force was equal to the
electrostatic force.</p>

\[
evB = eF \text{ or } v = \frac{F}{B}.
\]

<p>

This determined the velocity of the beam. Thus,</p>

\[
\frac{e}{m} = \frac{2dF}{B^2L^2}.
\]

<p>

Each of the quantities in the above expression was measured so the
\(\bfrac{e}{m}\) or \(\bfrac{m}{e}\) could be determined.</p>

<p>

Using this method Thomson found a value of \(\bfrac{m}{e}\) of \((1.29\pm 0.17)
\times 10^{-7}\). This value was independent of both the gas in the
tube and of the metal used in the cathode, suggesting that the
particles were constituents of the atoms of all substances. It was
also far smaller, by a factor of 1000, than the smallest value
previously obtained, \(10^{-4}\), that of the hydrogen ion in
electrolysis.</p>

<p>

Thomson remarked that this might be due to the smallness of
\(m\) or to the largeness of \(e\). He argued that \(m\)
was small citing Lenard&rsquo;s work on the range of cathode rays in air. The
range, which is related to the mean free path for collisions, and which
depends on the size of the object, was 0.5 cm. The mean free path for
molecules in air was approximately \(10^{-5}\) cm. If the cathode
ray traveled so much farther than a molecule before colliding with an
air molecule, Thomson argued that it must be much smaller than a
 molecule.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#A7-9" id="note-A7-9">9</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

Thomson had shown that cathode rays behave as one would expect
negatively charged material particles to behave. They deposited
negative charge on an electrometer, and were deflected by both electric
and magnetic fields in the appropriate direction for a negative charge.
In addition the value for the mass to charge ratio was far smaller than
the smallest value previously obtained, that of the hydrogen ion. If
the charge were the same as that on the hydrogen ion, the mass would be
far less. In addition, the cathode rays traveled farther in air than
did molecules, also implying that they were smaller than an atom or
molecule. Thomson concluded that these negatively charged particles
were constituents of atoms. In other words, Thomson&rsquo;s experiments had
given us good reasons to believe in the existence of electrons.</p>

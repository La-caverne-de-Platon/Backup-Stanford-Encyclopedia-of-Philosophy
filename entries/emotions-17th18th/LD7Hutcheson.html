<h3><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
Perhaps the clearest exemplar of a sentimentalist moral philosopher is
Francis Hutcheson (1694&ndash;1746). He offers a moral sense theory that
conceives of our affections much as did Shaftesbury, while maintaining
that our moral judgments bottom out in specific kinds of emotions.
Although his account of the emotions is closely tied to the
requirements of his moral philosophy, Hutcheson also develops an
affective psychology and phenomenology. The most important works for
understanding his views on the emotions are his <em>Inquiry into the
Original of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue</em> (1725) and his
<em>Essay on the Nature and Conduct of the Passions with Illustrations
on the Moral Sense</em> (1728), which discusses the views of Cicero
and Malebranche, among others. Further material can be found in
<em>Reflections upon Laughter, and Remarks on the Fable of the
Bees</em> (1725&ndash;6), in which he addresses the egoist psychology of
Hobbes and Mandeville, and in the multi-volumed <em>Philosophiae
moralis institutio compendiaria, ethices et jurisprudentiae naturalis
elementa continens</em>, lib. iii. (1742) and <em>System of Moral
Philosophy</em> (1755).</p>

<h3><a name="TerClaSen">2. Terminology and Classification of the Senses</a></h3>

<p>
These works teem with terminology and classificatory schemes for
describing both our emotions and our sense-faculties proliferate in
these works. Hutcheson understands a &lsquo;sense&rsquo; receptively,
as that which receives involuntary mental determinations, typically
attended with perceptions of pleasure or pain. More specifically, an
&ldquo;affection or passion&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;those
Modifications or Actions of the mind consequent on the Apprehension of
certain Objects or Events in which the Mind generally conceives Good
or Evil&rdquo; (<em>Essay</em> 15). Emotions are thus identified as
special kinds of sensations. There are, however, many different kinds
of sensations, and many different kinds of senses. The
<em>Philosophiae moralis institutio compendiaria</em> (lib. I, chap.
I, sec. 4&ndash;14) and the <em>System of Moral Philosophy</em> (Book I,
chap. II) list more than a dozen senses, while the <em>Essay</em>
(sec. I) restricts itself to a mere five, starting with the familiar
&lsquo;external&rsquo; sense. To this external sense, Hutcheson adds
an internal sense (comprising the aesthetic sense and the pleasures of
the imagination), a public sense (or <em>sensus communis</em> a kind
of fellow-feeling), a moral sense, and a sense of honor
(<em>Essay</em> 17&ndash;8), of which at least the last three have an
affective component. The senses are not completely independent of each
other: for instance, the moral sense requires an element of reflection
on the previous senses, and the fifth sense, the sense of honor
involves additional reflection on how others perceive and evaluate us
morally. Hutcheson takes simple perceptions of pleasure and pain to be
located in the external sense, but many other affections of the senses
seem intrinsically pleasurable or painful.</p>

<p>
All of these senses receive sensations. But they also generate desires
or aversions, especially through reflection, which in turn provide
spurs to action. Together they give Hutcheson his general account of
&lsquo;affections or passions,&rsquo; which incorporate a mixture of
immediate sensations and modifications produced by reflection:</p>

<blockquote>
[W]e denote by the Affection or Passion some other &ldquo;perceptions
of Pleasure or Pain, not directly raised by the Presence or Operation
of the Event or Object, but by our Reflection upon or Apprehension of
their present or certainly future Existence; so that we are sure that
the Object or Event will raise the direct Sensations in us.&rdquo;
(<em>Essay</em> 30)
</blockquote>

<p>
Hutcheson further distinguishes between an affection, involving a calm
desire or aversion, and a passion, which includes</p>

<blockquote>
a confused Sensation either of Pleasure or Pain, occasioned or
attended by some violent bodily Motions, which keeps the Mind much
employed upon the present Affair, to the exclusion of everything else,
and prolongs or strengthens the Affection sometimes to such a degree,
as to prevent all deliberate Reasoning about our Conduct.
(<em>Essay</em> 31)
</blockquote>

<p>
Hutcheson&rsquo;s account here shows influences from Malebranche,
although his scheme is considerably simpler. In particular, passions
involve a confused sensation, which allow them to grip our minds
tenaciously. Hutcheson also supposes that the passions involve
correlative bodily events, which helps explain both their confusion
and their tenacity, although he leaves it to &ldquo;Physicians or
Anatomists [to] explain the several Motions in the Fluids or Solids of
the Body, which accompany any Passion&rdquo; (<em>Essay</em> 47).
Confusion itself is linked with a kind of violence or agitation, so
that confused sensations alone may be enough to make our desires
become &lsquo;passionate.&rsquo; The violence of the passions also
seems partly a matter of their particularity: passions are directed at
particular objects, raising desires about them, in contrast with the
generality of, e.g., benevolence. Calm affections such as benevolence
likewise involve desires, but typically they are calm (Hutcheson cites
Marcus Aurelius as an exception who violently desired benevolence).
The frenzied desires evoked by the passions also seem to be directed
at what is immediate, while calm affections can be far-sighted.</p>

<p>
Hutcheson often rates their violence as a measure of the hold passions
may have on us. At the same time, he holds that we can override the
violent force of the passions by frequent reflection on the calm
desires, particularly by habituation of that reflection. Such
reflection is a crucial weapon in gaining command over the passions,
as prudence often dictates we should. Command of our passions becomes
morally praiseworthy when it is governed by the calm affection of
general benevolence. In general, our actions are motivated by our
prevailing desires, which can be generated by either the affections or
the passions of various senses. It is the distinction between calm
affection and violent, confused passion that Hutcheson uses to explain
how we seem to judge motivations, actions and &ldquo;tempers&rdquo;
(characters) on their rationality. Passions can oppose what we approve
on reflection, and it is what we approve on reflection that is
considered &lsquo;rational.&rsquo; Moreover, reflective evaluations
are what ground moral judgments. And Hutcheson argues, those are
generated by affections, not reason.</p>

<h3><a name="AffMorPhi">3. Affections and Moral Philosophy</a></h3>

<p>
The moral philosophy of Hutcheson&rsquo;s <em>Inquiry</em> borrows
many important elements from Shaftesbury. It rests on the notion of a
moral sense, which is an inborn faculty and comparable to the
aesthetic sense. And although all our affections involve an element of
reflection, the exercise of the moral sense calls for additional
reflection by someone adopting the position of a spectator. What the
spectator takes as objects of moral evaluation are the affections of
rational agents, insofar as they produce intentional actions. Moral
evaluation is particularly targeted at those cases where agents
exhibit other-directed affections, or where we feel that they should.
For, like Shaftesbury, Hutcheson holds the crucial feature of our
moral evaluation to be that we approve affections that are irreducibly
benevolent and other-directed, while condemning inappropriately
selfish ones. A spectator then looks to the actions of a rational
agent to see how they flow from some affection toward other sensitive
beings. Identifying the affection as a form of benevolence, involving
a desire for the happiness of another, the spectator feels approbation
and can reflectively judge the agent to be virtuous. In contrast, we
condemn agents as vicious when their self-love overrides the
benevolence intrinsic to human psychology.</p>

<p>
Like many other early modern theorists of the emotions (including
Hobbes and Mandeville), Hutcheson considers us to be incapable of true
malice. In general, he assumes that nature, or at least our
psychological nature, is generally benevolent, much as did
Shaftesbury, although Hutcheson thinks that Shaftesbury&rsquo;s
natural teleology gets the order of explanation wrong. Because of the
intrinsically well-ordered benevolence of our nature, our feelings of
approval and condemnation, and their correlative moral affections are
inherently pleasurable and painful. But Hutcheson insists that the
pleasure and pain are effects of the approbation or condemnation, not
their causes. Pleasure and pain are, in turn, antecedent to any sense
of advantage or interest, which derive from those feelings. Our moral
sense is thus &lsquo;disinterested&rsquo; in a way that is comparable
to the aesthetic sense. And the moral sense seems internally
consistent: just as we approve of benevolent affections in those we
judge, so too can our judgments withstand our own scrutiny.</p>

<h3><a name="PsyArgBen">4. Psychological Arguments for Benevolence</a></h3>

<p>
Hutcheson argues frequently and forcefully that we are capable of
irreducibly benevolent affections and passions, against the view he
associates with Hobbes and Mandeville that all passions are, in the
final analysis, forms of self-interest. Self-interest, he maintains,
cannot explain why we approve what we do, and in particular, why we
identify with those of benevolent character. Hutcheson also argues
that it is impossible to reduce <em>feelings</em> of benevolence to
what is advantageous, because we cannot feel benevolence at will, no
matter how clearly we calculate the advantage in doing so
(<em>Inquiry</em>, 126&ndash;7). Hutcheson&rsquo;s argument supposes that
our affections and passions are not under our direct control; they are
in large measure passive feelings. But although we cannot feel
affections or passions at will, we are naturally fitted to feeling
particular affections, including benevolent ones, under particular
circumstances. Such benevolence may generate some pain for the
well-meaning individual, so not even desire for pleasure can explain
away our benevolence. Moreover, even when benevolence is accompanied
by pleasure, the aim of the benevolence is not a desire for
pleasure.</p>

<p>
Hutcheson seems to take it as evidence of our benevolence that besides
general benevolence, we also feel particular affections that are
other-directed: natural affection, gratitude, honor, shame, or
compassion. All of these are supposed to show extensive benevolence at
work. Indeed, he often groups all other-directed passions together,
assuming that they must be directed at the good of others, so they
seem so many forms of benevolence. Nonetheless, we do make
distinctions of moral worth relative to the extent of the
other-directed affection: the more general the benevolence, the higher
its moral worth. On the other hand, the existence of an other-based
passion of limited scope (e.g., parental anxiety for children) can
play an extenuating role in the evaluation of an action. Then too,
because we can play the role of spectator for ourselves, we may extend
our benevolent impulses to ourselves, that is, we can form
self-related desires stemming from benevolence. This does not
eliminate the distinction between self-love and benevolence, but it
means that benevolence does not require self-abnegation at all times.
It also suggests that there may be genuine differences of kind among
self-directed affections, differences that will generate very
different reflective affections and lead us to attribute to some a
moral worth lacked by mere selfishness.</p>

<h3><a name="FunRolAff">5. The Fundamental Role of Affections</a></h3>

<p>
Crucial to Hutcheson&rsquo;s understanding of our moral sense is his
case against rationalism in moral philosophy. The arguments by which
he makes his case are based in considerations of the relation between
means and ends. To this end he makes several distinctions among our
determinations and reason, arguing that reason alone cannot explain
any of them. It can explain neither election, an agent&rsquo;s
determination to an action, nor approbation, the spectator&rsquo;s
evaluation of an action. When we seek the ultimate ends for either, we
find that reason is merely instrumental, and cannot give exciting
reasons, i.e., the reasons that motivate an action. Those bottom out
in instincts and affections. Justifying reasons, on the other hand,
depend on our approval of an end, which requires recourse to a sense.
And so they bottom out in the moral sense, which depends on affections
and their reflection.</p>

<p>
Something similar can be said about our natural moral
&ldquo;obligations.&rdquo; They rest on our basic psychological
impulse of benevolence, making our sense of obligation a
&ldquo;determination of our nature&rdquo; (<em>Inquiry</em>, 244).
Hutcheson seems to equivocate a bit here: either
&lsquo;obligation&rsquo; simply means motivation, or
&lsquo;nature&rsquo; is normatively freighted. But that may simply be
because he has no recourse for explaining normative judgments other
than through our affections and sense-faculty. And Hutcheson argues
that we cannot turn our approbation or condemnation on the
sense-faculty itself &ndash; that is, we cannot judge its moral worth
&ndash; <em>except</em> insofar as we use the moral sense.
Fortunately, we all share impulses of benevolence, and feel reflective
affections that esteem those impulses as overriding all others.</p>

<h3><a name="PsyPhePasConOveHap">6. Psychology and Phenomenology of the Passions and Control Over Happiness</a></h3>

<p>
As we have seen, the affections differ from simple sensations in that
they are reflective. They are also motivating, because they are
related to desire and aversion, and so they explain intentional
actions &ndash; actions directed at obtaining (or avoiding) some
object. The <em>Essay</em> also allows that our emotions may involve
&ldquo;propensities,&rdquo; which are directions of action, detached
from any notion of &ldquo;good.&rdquo; Propensities may, therefore,
motivate action, but in a way that lacks a goal, or real intention, as
Hutcheson explains in the case of anger (<em>Essay</em> 52). Such
propensities distinguish passions from the calm affections. The
passions may also have distinctive sensations, or feels, but it is
their propensities that explain the particular motivational force and
almost unintentional character of passion-driven action. They will
also explain why passions do not always answer to beliefs about
objects, for they contain a drive that is not directed at bringing
about an objective state of affairs.</p>

<p>
In the absence of something like Shaftesbury&rsquo;s natural
teleology, Hutcheson can offer no guarantee that exercising our
benevolent affections, the ones that generate our moral approbation,
will likewise produce happiness. Happiness is a matter of pleasure, in
particular the pleasures linked to our passions and affections. We are
happy when the pleasurable affections and passions, and to a lesser
degree, sensations, predominate over the painful ones.</p>

<p>
The pursuit of happiness raises the question of how much control we
have over our passions and affections, so as to maximize pleasurable
ones and minimize painful ones. Hutcheson&rsquo;s answer is that we do
not have much. Still, there are several ways to exert the control we
do have. First, insofar as passions and affections are linked to
opinions, we may be able to exercise some control over our opinions.
The propensities of our passions, however, are not very responsive to
opinion. Fortunately, our epistemic state is much less important for
our happiness than is our social situation. Among our natural,
benevolent affections are affections directed at the happiness of
others. That means that our happiness is directly dependent on the
happiness of others, particularly those close to us. That too is not
fully in our control, a point on which Hutcheson takes Stoic views to
task (<em>Essay</em> 82). Nonetheless, we do act for the happiness of
others, and hope that our actions will see success. So, whatever we
can do to achieve the ends of our benevolent affections will, in fact,
increase our own chances for happiness. By the same token, we might be
advised to choose our friends wisely, selecting those most likely to
allow our benevolent actions to bear fruit. Last, Hutcheson argues
that to the degree we can turn our violent passions into calm
affections, we will optimize the chances for pleasure over pain. Again
for this reason, exercising our benevolent affections seems a sound
strategy.</p>

<h3><a name="InfLatAut">7. Influences on Later Authors</a></h3>

<p>
Hutcheson&rsquo;s influence was particularly marked on those authors
who adopted, or simply considered, sentimentalist positions in moral
philosophy, such as Hume, and even more, Adam Smith (1723&ndash;90), who
studied under Hutcheson. Hume was also clearly affected by
Hutcheson&rsquo;s moral and affective psychology, from which he
learned much. But Hume argued directly against Hutcheson&rsquo;s
approach to our other-directed passions, distinguishing sharply
between extensive benevolence and limited generosity. Hume went so far
as to allow that other-directed passions need not be benevolent in
character at all, admitting malice as a genuine psychological
possibility. Both Hume and Smith also borrowed some of
Hutcheson&rsquo;s (and Shaftesbury&rsquo;s) terminology, but put it to
novel uses, quite different from what Hutcheson envisioned. And Smith
used the very notion of sympathy to argue against the basis on which
Hutcheson built his moral sense theory, particularly criticizing it
for providing no independent measure of its own normative status.
Instead, Smith argues that we normally appraise the propriety of
sentiments, whether of others or our own, by subjecting them to
&ldquo;the great discipline&rdquo; established by nature: &ldquo;a
regard to the sentiments of the real or supposed spectator of our
conduct&rdquo; (1982, 145).</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Transitional Justice</a></h2>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-1" id="note-1">1.</a>  Other transitional
policies include administrative purges, the opening of archives,
reparations and the creation of public monuments. I have decided to
concentrate on war crime tribunals and truth commissions both because
these are the most frequently used instruments (other policies are
most often implemented, if at all, in conjunction with these) and
because their employment raises the philosophical dilemmas associated
with the aftermath of war in the sharpest, most dramatic fashion.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-2" id="note-2">2.</a>  Part 1 draws on
Eisikovits 2013; parts 2 and 3 draw on Eisikovits 2009; part 5 draws
on Rotondi and Eisikovits, forthcoming.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-3" id="note-3">3.</a>  Jeremy Waldron makes a
powerful case for the importance of historical memory in his classic
&ldquo;Superseding Historical Injustice&rdquo; (before arguing that
the force of historical injustices can, sometimes, be superseded). See
Waldron 2001.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-4" id="note-4">4.</a>  It is with this in mind
that Michael Ignatieff has argued that the most important function
of truth commissions has been to &ldquo;narrow the scope of
permissible lies&rdquo;. See Ignatieff 1996.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-5" id="note-5">5.</a>  It is worth noting that
the conflict here is practical rather than conceptual. Trials can be
accompanied by serious politically sanctioned historical bodies of
inquiry, which have as their goal the collection of a broad,
comprehensive set of data. But given the limitation on resources
prevalent in most situations of political transition, few polities
can afford to engage in both.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-6" id="note-6">6.</a>  For a good account of
lustration policies after World War II see Judt's <em>Postwar</em>
(2006). For an account of post communist lustration policies (or the
lack thereof) see Rosenberg 1996.  </p>



<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-7" id="note-7">7.</a>  Earlier attempts to
conduct war crime trials against the Germans in the aftermath of
World War 1 and against the Turks for the massacre of Armenians were
mostly abortive: Wilhelm II escaped and found refuge in the
Netherlands. The German courts essentially refused to convict or
seriously punish those the allies had designated as major war
criminals. The British, who started out with a strong commitment to
prosecute Turkish war criminals, lost much of their resolve and
ended up trading many of the Ottoman killers in their custody for
British POWs. For a good survey of these early attempts see Bass
2002: Ch. 2,3,4.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-8" id="note-8">8.</a>  Commenting on the
 significance of the trials for international human rights law, John
 Shuttock (2006: 7) has recently claimed that,</p>

<blockquote><p> the Genocide Convention, the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and ultimately the international human rights
movement&mdash;all grew out of the great Nuremberg
experiment.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-9" id="note-9">9.</a>  The Nuremberg trials
are documented by special projects at Harvard and Yale law schools
(see, in the Other Internet Resources section, the link to the
Nuremberg Trials Project at Harvard, and the Contents of the Nuremberg
Trials Collection at the Yale Law School Avalon Project).  Many
materials pertaining to ICTY decisions can be found on its
website. Proceedings of the Milo&scaron;evi&#263; trials are available at the
Milo&scaron;evi&#263; Trial Public Archive, at Bard College. The ICTR website also
contains a great deal of documentary information.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-10" id="note-10">10.</a>  For good accounts of
the aims and limitations of Hybrid Courts see Higonnet 2006 and Nouwen
2006.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-11" id="note-11">11.</a>  Public lecture in 2008
by Judge Philippe Kirsch, President, International Criminal Court.
See, in the Other Internet Resources section, Kirsch
2008. As Kirsch himself admits, such deterrence is extremely hard to
measure.
</p>

<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-12" id="note-12">12.</a> The court's
indictment of Bashir has generated both a great deal of excitement and
a great deal of skepticism. While enthusiasts characterize the
indictment as the most important since the ones issued by prosecutors
at Nuremberg, skeptics worry that the proceedings would disrupt
ongoing efforts to quell the violence in Sudan. For samples of both
types of reaction see Morgan 2008, Scott 2008, and Hanson 2008.</p>


<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-13" id="note-13">13.</a>  President Clinton
signed the Rome Statute with reservations, stating that he signed the
order to &ldquo;remain engaged in making the ICC an instrument of
impartial and effective justice in the years to come.&rdquo; However,
he counseled the United States not to join until its concerns had
been addressed.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-14" id="note-14">14.</a>  See UNSC Resolution
1970. Hillary Clinton said prior to her confirmation by the
U.S. Senate in 2009, that as Secretary of State, she would work to</p>

<blockquote><p> end the hostility towards the ICC, and look for
opportunities to encourage effective ICC action in ways that promote
US interests by bringing war criminals to justice. (Clinton
2009: 66)</p></blockquote>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-15" id="note-15">15.</a>  It would seem that
worries of victors' justice are less relevant when it comes to
international tribunals such as the ICTY, ICTR or the ICC which were
not set up by victorious parties. However, even when it comes to such
&ldquo;internationalized&rdquo; judicial bodies, powerful nations
still have the wherewithal to make sure their military personnel are
not at risk of prosecution by international tribunals. The ICTY will
not take up any of NATO's bombing, The ICTR will not directly take up
European passivity in the face of escalating Hutu belligerence, and
the ICC has not yet considered cases outside of Africa. In so far as
the idea behind victor's justice is that the extent of one's political
power determines whether they are the dispensers of justice or subject
to it, the complaint still holds.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-16" id="note-16">16.</a>  See, e.g., interview
with McNamara in Errol Morris' documentary <em>The Fog of War</em>
(2003).</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-17" id="note-17">17.</a>  The conspiracy
jurisprudence developed in Nuremberg certainly brings up the same
difficulty: organizations such as the SS and Gestapo were declared
criminal and all their members were subjected to conviction solely on
this basis, without the need to establish individual <em>mens
rea</em>.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-18" id="note-18">18.</a>  For an excellent
treatment of the tensions between legalism and the use of CR (as well
as other doctrines that challenge legalistic assumptions) see Drumbel
(2005) and Robinson (forthcoming). Also of interest in this context is Osiel's
(1999) defense of &ldquo;liberal show trials&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-19" id="note-19">19.</a>  There are indications
that this is changing with the advent of the ICC. As noted earlier,
the jurisprudence regarding the conditions and extent of victims'
involvement in the proceedings of the ICC has not yet been
crystallized. To the extent that victims are allowed to have a
substantial role in influencing punishment or even in the selection of
whom to indict, the court will be jettisoning its original commitment
to strict, procedural legalism.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-20" id="note-20">20.</a>  Reporting on the ICTY
for the <em>Financial Times</em>, John Lloyd
(2008) writes:</p>

<blockquote><p> The trials are often grindingly boring, heavy on
detail, challenges, asides, elaborate courtesies. Following an early
morning flight, I fell asleep watching the trial of two Macedonians,
charged with a murderous attack on the Muslim village of Ljuboten in
2001. I was roused by a stern UN guard, but soon fell asleep
again&mdash;to be prodded awake by her truncheon.  A sole spectator
slumbering in the gallery does not enhance the dignity of the court. I
claim, in extenuation, some distinguished precedents.  Rebecca West,
covering Nuremberg for <em>The New Yorker</em>, found the proceedings
&ldquo;insufferably tedious&rdquo;.
 </p></blockquote>

<p>
Similar concerns about tedium prompted a senior member of the
prosecution team at Nuremberg to resign when Robert Jackson decided to
focus his case on documentary evidence and rely less on dramatic live
evidence.</p>

<p> <a href="index-2.html#ref-21" id="note-21">21.</a> Describing her
experience of the ICTR, journalist and human rights activist Helena
Cobban (2004) notes:</p>

<blockquote><p> You go to this courtroom, set in the middle of a
bustling African market town, and here are people enacting these
strange rituals of a European-style courtroom. I was looking at this
whole thing through a sort of anthropological lens and it seemed so
bizarre, so weird, that you have these people here who normally
practice in British-style courts and are wearing their little powdered
wigs and all the lawyers and judges wear long robes. They all wear
little lacy bits at their throat, which is something that happens in
French courts. To see them going through all these rituals of people
coming into the court in an orderly fashion and standing and rising
and sitting, and &ldquo;My learned friend&rdquo; this, and &ldquo;His
Honor, the Judge&rdquo; that, in the middle of this African market
town, it just strikes me as bizarre.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-22" id="note-22">22.</a>  For a chilling survey
of failures in preventing genocide in the 20<sup>th</sup> century
see Power (2002). It is unclear if the claim is fair given the long
break in the practice of international criminal justice during the
cold war.  In other words, we do not yet have a long enough record
to tell whether the practice of international criminal law can lead
to deterrence. What we can tell is that Nuremberg didn't prevent
Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and that the tribunals set up to account for
these atrocities didn't help prevent the genocide in Sudan.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-23" id="note-23">23.</a>  Bolivia, Uruguay,
Uganda, Zimbabwe and Chad also made use of truth commissions before
South Africa did, but these efforts were far less substantial.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-24" id="note-24">24.</a>  My summary of the
three Latin American truth commissions is based on Hayner
(2001). More literature on the Salvadorian commission is
available online from the United State Institute of Peace. More
information on the Chilean commission is available online from
BeyondIntractability.org.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-25" id="note-25">25.</a>  This survey of the
circumstances surrounding the creation of the TRC draws on Boraine
(2001), Graybill
(2002), Hayner (2002), Meredith (1999) and van der Merwe (
2003, 2005</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-26" id="note-26">26.</a>  For good accounts of
the legislative process see Krog (1998) and Graybill (2002:
ch.1).</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-27" id="note-27">27.</a>  For a more specific
account of the criteria used to determine whether an act was
&lsquo;politically motivated&rsquo; see Hayner (2002: 274 fn. 32).</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-28" id="note-28">28.</a>  For more detail see
Minow (2000: 56) and Kiss (2000: 68). South Africa's constitutional
court rejected a last moment challenge to the legality of the TRC
filed by the families of Steven Biko and human rights lawyer Griffith
Mxenge.  The claimants argued that the commission unconstitutionally
blocked them from receiving compensation for the murder of their
relatives.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-29" id="note-29">29.</a>  The phrase is taken
from a BBC news report aired on May 31, 2001 (Childs 2001). See also
Michael Ignatieff's (1997a) reportage about the TRC for the New
Yorker.  He writes: &ldquo;The reality is that, when you trade amnesty
for truth, murderers get away with murder&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-30" id="note-30">30.</a>  Brazilian Senator
Rondolfe Rodrigues stated in a October 27, 2011 interview with
Brazil's Folha newspaper, &ldquo;It's a timid commission, much less than those set up in
Uruguay and Argentina&rdquo; (BBC
2011).</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-31" id="note-31">31.</a>  The best, most
comprehensive philosophical treatment of forgiveness can be found in
Griswold 2007. Griswold rejects the appropriateness of political
forgiveness, arguing it should be replaced by political
apologies. For a detailed account of the argument against
forgiveness in politics see also Eisikovits (2004).</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-32" id="note-32">32.</a>  Elmer Plischke (1947)
provides an excellent account of the evolution of the Allied
denazification efforts.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-33" id="note-33">33.</a>  For a full discussion
of the problems associated with denazification in Germany, see
Joseph Napoli's excellent article &ldquo;Denazification from an
American's Viewpoint&rdquo; (1949). Napoli served as the former
chief of the Denazification Division and advisor on denazification
matters to the director of Military Government.  The definitive
recent account of Denazification and its limits can be found in Judt
2006.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-34" id="note-34">34.</a>  Former officials and
collaborators were barred from holding positions federal and local
government, ranks of colonel and higher in the Czechoslovak Army,
the federal police service and intelligence agency, the executive
and legislative branches, the court system, media, and state-owned
enterprises.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-35" id="note-35">35.</a>  For an illuminating
argument according to which lustration is a form of
&ldquo;administrative justice&rdquo; that is, practically speaking,
more important in shaping the post conflict environment that trials
or reparations see Meierhenrich 2006. Meierhenrich argues that
lustration policies must be guided by principles of
&ldquo;prudence&rdquo; and &ldquo;proportionality&rdquo; which can
and should limit the degree of lustration practiced. These
principles are supposed to prevent lustration from becoming a
catalyst for future war. But it seems plausible to use them as
guarantors of the functionality of the emerging regime (especially
since its failure may well ignite future war). For an excellent
consideration of the relationship between lustration and public
trust see Horne and Levi 2004</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-36" id="note-36">36.</a>  Martha Minow (1998)
provides a fascinating example to illuminate this difficulty: what
if we find out that East German guards, facing prosecution for
shooting those who tried to leave for the west, were especially
screened for obedience? That only those with a unique (perhaps
morbid) disposition to obey were hired to do this job? It is easy to
multiply examples further and ask how extortion, threats against
one's family or advancement opportunities for one's children impact
culpability.</p>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-37" id="note-37">37.</a>  See Letki 2002: 542,</p>

<blockquote><p> Again, the only exception is the former GDR where,
despite some acts of destruction, the citizen committees carefully
preserved the files of over 6 million people. It is estimated that in
Poland around 40&ndash;50% of files were destroyed, while in
Czechoslovakia the number was as high as 90%, but the lists of agents
and collaborators were kept in an electronic form.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-38" id="note-38">38.</a>  See Letki 2002: 542,</p>

<blockquote><p> the files are simultaneously
&ldquo;over-inclusive&rdquo;, as not all people listed as agents or
informers really collaborated, and &ldquo;under-inclusive&rdquo;, as
the major agents were probably not listed. Additionally, in some
countries the secret service employees added fictitious collaborators
to improve their results: in Poland the number of registered
collaborators rose each spring.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<a href="index-2.html#ref-39" id="note-39">39.</a>  It is important to
note that politically sanctioned amnesia has its limits. While it may
impact school curricula and public spaces, the state has a much harder
time reaching the informal mechanisms, which transmit cultural and
collective memories. In other words, chances are that a policy of
forgetting will not result in enough actual forgetting (given, e.g.,
what young children are taught at home or what they pick up from older
neighbors) to prevent the lingering of resentment.</p>

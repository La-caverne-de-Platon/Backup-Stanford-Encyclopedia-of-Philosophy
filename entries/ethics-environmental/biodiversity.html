<h2>Biodiversity Preservation</h2>

<p>
The diversity of life on earth has long been thought to deserve
attention, and respect. John Muir used a version of Christianity in
his attempt to argue that species deserve our respect: &ldquo;Again
and again, in season or out of season, the question comes up,
&lsquo;what are rattlesnakes good for?&rsquo; as if nothing that does
not rightly make for the benefit of man had any right to exist; as if
our ways were God&rsquo;s ways&rdquo; (Muir 1916: 98&ndash;99).
Despite this, and similar remarks from other early writers, it was
only in the 1980s that sustainability came to the fore as a focus of
environmental policy, and in this section, we look at the notion of
 <a href="../biodiversity/index.html">biodiversity</a>,
 one that was hardly a central concern of biologists or ecosystems
theorists in the 1980s (Tilman 2000). Nonetheless, a significant
number of books and papers by biologists and philosophers have long
sounded a warning about the loss of species, the possible impact of
such losses on ecosystem functions and the reduction in value &ndash;
both moral and economic &ndash; that was likely as a consequence of
the reduction in natural variety (Norton 1986 and 1987; Wilson
1992).</p>

<p>
The work of scientists and philosophers fed into the publication in
1992 of the <em>United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity</em>
(UN 1992). The preamble to the document refers explicitly both to the
utility of nature, and also to its intrinsic value, echoing themes
from both economics and philosophy. The contracting parties, it
explains, are conscious &ldquo;of the intrinsic value of biological
diversity and of the ecological, genetic, social, economic,
scientific, educational, cultural, recreational and aesthetic values
of biological diversity and its components&rdquo;. They are also
&ldquo;conscious of the importance of biological diversity for
evolution and for maintaining life sustaining systems of the
biosphere&rdquo; (UN 1992: 1).</p>

<p>
A question that arises in discussions of how best to preserve the
diversity of life concerns how biodiversity is to be measured. Related
to this is the puzzle of whether the biodiversity of an area &ndash;
however it is calculated &ndash; reveals something about its
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; value? Debates over these questions go to the
heart of discussions on biodiversity. A further question is whether
the ethics of conservation has a specific focus on preservation of
wilderness as such, or at least a focus on landscapes and populations
that are natural. In fact, high biodiversity, by some measures, can be
associated with human use and occupation, as when adding a farming
system to a desert raises local diversity. Hence, not all natural
systems maximize biodiversity when left undisturbed (see Brennan and
Lo 2010: 113&ndash;37 for discussion of what is meant by
&ldquo;natural&rdquo;). In some temperate forest systems, it is
disturbance to the forest &ndash; including human land clearing
activities &ndash; that provokes an increase in diversity in tree
species (Brennan 2014: 92&ndash;108). On the other hand, many highly
prized wild places are not particularly rich in natural variety
(Sarkar 2005: 21&ndash;44). In some places, wilderness and
biodiversity are indeed closely related, as in those set-aside wild
areas that are also hotspots of biodiversity. There seems to be no
doubt that management and preservation of natural variety is easier in
the presence of low human population density (Mittermeier et al.
2003). Nonetheless the protection of biodiversity is quite a different
issue from the preservation of wilderness. Some critics of current
conservation practices urge that while protection of wilderness is a
demanding goal in a world of ever-increasing human influence, the
protection of biodiversity sets the bar too low if it simply aims at
&ldquo;the preservation of viable populations of species in their
natural surroundings&rdquo; (Mathews 2016, 141). Such viability, it
can be argued, is compatible with the conservation of only minimal
remnants of once abundant species and a consequent reduction in
natural value.</p>

<p>
A persistent complication is that there continues to be no single
agreed measure of biodiversity (Maier 2012: 115&ndash;20). For
example, the concept of
 <a href="../species/index.html">species</a>
 itself is capable of being defined in a variety of different ways.
This is a complicating factor in any discussion about policies dealing
with species numbers and diversity. One everyday understanding of the
concept is the biological species concept, namely that, for sexually
reproducing plants and animals, a species is a population of organisms
that closely resemble each other genetically and are capable of
interbreeding so as to produce fertile offspring. But there are other
accounts. For example, according to certain genealogical or
phylogenetic species concepts, two individuals are members of the same
species if they both belong to the smallest group of individuals that
share a common ancestor. A problem now arises: those who adopt the
phylogenetic species concept will count species numbers differently
from those who adopt the biological species concept. For example, one
study claims that adopting the phylogenetic concept rather than one of
the others would lead to large increases in the numbers of species to
be found in various places. Looking at eighty-nine published studies
on species populations, the study found that adopting the phylogenetic
concept led to nearly a 50 per cent increase in the number of species
identified in the various studies. Using the same concept resulted in
a nearly 260 per cent increase in the number of lichen species
identified and an 87 per cent increase in the number of mammal species
(Agapow et al. 2004). If species are the fundamental units both of
evolution and of biodiversity, then it is important to get the species
concept sorted out. As one author puts it, &ldquo;If our species
counts are problematic, so will be our assessments of
biodiversity&rdquo; (Richards 2010: 10). This problem may be lessened
if a unified species concept is successfully developed, one that is
suitable for use in biodiversity studies (Freudenstein et al.
2017).</p>

<p>
Alongside biodiversity, field research has concentrated on two other
features: ecosystem stability and biological productivity. The problem
of measuring biodiversity is compounded by ones involved in measuring
both stability and productivity, leading to extended controversy among
theorists in the 1990s (described in Sarkar 2005: 106&ndash;44). While
some authorities once regarded high levels of biodiversity as
correlated with high systemic productivity and high stability, this
view was at odds with the observation that many of the world&rsquo;s
most highly productive systems are not very species-rich. However,
some consensus has emerged that moderately diverse systems have high
productivity and that extra diversity within such systems may yield
insurance against external perturbations that might lead to a
reduction in productivity. The arguments here are highly technical
(for summary, see deLaplante and Picasso 2011). They point to the
conclusion that conservation and rehabilitation efforts are best
focused on whole systems, not individual populations. What matters is
not so much defending or restoring individual species, but rather
maintaining clusters of species making up landscape, forest or river
systems.</p>

<p>
For the most part, the ecosystem services which satisfy a large number
of human preferences are supplied by relatively simple, non-diverse
systems, such as salt marshes (useful for water filtration), and the
low-diversity agricultural systems in which food is produced. These
facts are consistent with the view that the strongest arguments for
the preservation of biodiversity may actually not be based on its
utility for human beings. In fact, Norton&rsquo;s observation (Norton
1988) that cost-benefit analysis in terms of human interests alone
does not support biodiversity has a striking parallel in arguments
about human value. Consider, for example, the view that the strongest
reason for governments to protect the welfare of their citizens should
come from the moral notion of human dignity &ndash; an inherent worth
possessed by each person which is to be respected regardless of the
person&rsquo;s circumstances and relations, including the
person&rsquo;s cost-and-benefit-relations to others (cf. Brennan and
Lo 2007). If the government of a state has no intrinsic moral concern
for the dignity and well-being of its citizens and its reason for
raising or enforcing standards of health and security, for example, is
merely that a healthier population and safer streets will generate a
higher gross domestic product, more revenues for the state and more
money and power for those running it, then it is unlikely that such a
government will be motivated to protect those citizens who are
considered too weak, too aged, or otherwise unfit to be productive in
economic or other instrumental terms. In a parallel fashion, many
endangered species have already become functionally marginal to the
ecosystem in which they are found. Someone who takes a purely
cost-benefit perspective could argue that the negative impacts of the
demise of those species on the system&rsquo;s productivity might well
be negligible or otherwise acceptable in anthropocentric terms, since
the resources that would be required to preserve or restore
populations of those species could be used to promote human benefits
in other ways. Just as in the human case, cost-benefit perspectives on
nature do not seem to provide a compelling reason for protecting many
endangered species. This argument is complicated by the findings about
cascading species extinctions, which may also be a factor in the
conjectured worldwide reduction in vital insect species &ndash; a
reduction which threatens human food supplies (Van der Sluijs and
Vaage 2016). Such findings suggest that biodiversity may be of
significant benefit to human life. Some writers have gone on to
criticize biocentric positions &ndash; like Aldo Leopold&rsquo;s
&ndash; that appear to endorse the intrinsic value of natural things
and communities. Such positions, it is argued, provide no better
support for biodiversity preservation than enlightened
anthropocentrism (Norton 1991, 93&ndash;102; Newman, Varner and
Linquist 2017, ch.10).</p>

<p>
But, apart from its potential importance to human beings, is
biodiversity an intrinsic good worth protecting as an end-in-itself
regardless of the instrumental values that it may or may not have for
humans? The answer seems to depend on answers to at least two further
questions: first, whether all living things &ndash; irrespective of
species &ndash; are intrinsically valuable; and second, whether a
world with diversity in intrinsic values is better than a world
homogeneous in intrinsic values. Take the second question first. In
terms of mere preference or liking, people often prefer having a
variety of things they like to just having more of the same thing they
like. The same pattern of appraisal may actually be true of values as
well. Suppose people generally prefer an assembly of good things of
different kinds to a bigger collection of good things of the same
kind, and suppose this preference for diversity in good things can
survive sustained reflection and scrutiny by people across time and
culture, then, diversity in good things is of itself also a good
thing. Thus, if one starts with the moral biocentric outlook that each
and every life form is intrinsically valuable, then it will be natural
as well as correct for one to accept the further proposition that
biodiversity &ndash; that is, the diversity in biological forms of
life &ndash; is also something intrinsically valuable. In short, if
life is a good thing, and if a world containing good things of more
different kinds is better than a world containing good things of fewer
kinds, then higher biodiversity is better than lower biodiversity.</p>

<p>
So what appears to be critical to the ethics of biodiversity is the
first question: Is each and every living thing &ndash; irrespective of
species &ndash; really valuable in itself? Taylor&rsquo;s argument for
the core thesis of biocentrism has already been reviewed: every living
organism is intrinsically valuable because each has interests and
goods of its own and each is capable of flourishing. The underlying
idea is that if a being is able to fare better or worse, it is
<em>prima facie</em> morally better if it fares better rather than
worse. Still, there is a sceptical challenge which calls into question
the moral relevance of biological interests. What reasons could there
be for us to respect or give moral weight to the biological interests
(if any) of a tapeworm (cf. O&rsquo;Neill 1992: 131&ndash;132) or, to
take a more fanciful example, of the lethal creatures in sci-fi movies
like the <em>Aliens</em> series? To this request for reasons, the
biocentrist&rsquo;s best reply may be a further question: what good
reasons do we have for thinking that members of the human species are
more worthy than members of other species on Earth?</p>

<p>
Many traditional arguments for attributing intrinsic value in a
significantly higher degree, if not exclusively, to human beings have
a common structure: they appeal to the fact humans have certain
traits, such as self-consciousness, rationality, the capacities for
language, for moral decision, for aesthetic creation and appreciation,
and many other abilities and skills that are considered as meritorious
or otherwise worthy, traits which no other life form on Earth has, or
has to nearly such a great extent that humans have them. The
underlying idea is that since these traits are the most valuable and
morally relevant, creatures who possess them to a greater extent are
more worthy than creatures who possess them to a lesser extent or lack
them altogether. As critics have pointed out, however, these arguments
setting out to compare the moral worth of different species do not
actually start off from neutral ground. Instead, the set of traits
identified, and assumed by the arguments to be the most morally
relevant and worthy, are none other than exactly those traits
characteristically and typically possessed by members of our own
species (Taylor 1986, Plumwood 1993). As the history of interspecies
comparisons in science and medicine has shown, researchers have faced
constant challenges in maintaining the gap between the value they
place on humans on the one hand and the animal research subjects with
which they interact, on the other (Mason, Dentinger and Woods
2018).</p>

<p>
If we are not to beg the question in favour of human superiority, it
can be noted that objective comparisons can be made of different
individuals of the same species regarding their species specific
merits (that is, those capacities and skills required for living a
good life relative to the species) &ndash; for example, over whether a
certain antelope is better in detecting and escaping from dangers than
another antelope, or whether a certain bear has better skills in
catching fish than another bear. But if there is no one single
standard of the good life that is applicable across all species, then
we might argue &ndash; going further than Taylor &ndash; that it would
not even be conceptually coherent or sensible to compare the merits of
individuals belonging to different species. For example, it would not
make sense to ask whether an antelope who has the capacities and
skills to live a good antelope life is &lsquo;better&rsquo; than a
bear who has the capacities and skills to live a good bear life. If
this is right, then the same logic should apparently apply when
evaluating those arguments that seek to attribute superiority to
humans over other living things: it would likewise not make sense to
say that a human being who has the capacities and skills (e.g.,
self-consciousness, rationality, language, moral freedom, aesthetic
creativity) to live a good human life is &lsquo;better&rsquo; than a
living thing of another species who has the capacities and skills to
live a good life relative to its species.</p>

<p>
Showing that there are problems with &ndash; and even failures in
arguments for &ndash; human superiority does not amount to positively
establishing the general biocentric thesis that all living things are
intrinsically valuable, let alone the more controversial egalitarian
biocentric proposition that all living things are equal in intrinsic
value. Nevertheless, on the supposition that the appeal to human
superiority is the only line of defence that humans have in attempting
morally to justify their destructive exploitation of the earth&rsquo;s
environment and its other inhabitants, then, given that humans have
already benefited disproportionately at the great expense of members
of many other species, the onus appears to be on the humans to
demonstrate that they are indeed &lsquo;greater&rsquo; than the rest.
There is a paradox in such a conclusion. If the greatness of humanity
is not mere human self-aggrandisement, then such greatness may consist
at its core in a moral capacity to look beyond the interests of
oneself and one&rsquo;s close associates, and to show a willingness to
care for and share with those who are less able to fend for
themselves.</p>

<h2>Four Teachings</h2>

<p>

Let us explore these four positions, and their progression and
synonymity, in a bit more detail.</p>

<h3>1. Tripitaka Teaching</h3>

<p>

The Tripitaka teaching is associated with &ldquo;Hinayana,&rdquo;
the teachings of the <em>Nikaya</em> and
<em>Agama</em> scriptures, closely parallel to what is found in the
Pali canon: the doctrine of impermanence of all conditioned dharmas,
arising and perishing in every instant, along with the thoroughgoing
denial of any sort of permanent or unconditional entity, with the
exception of Nirvana itself. Reality is pure flux, arising
and perishing a vast number of times within the span of each
moment. This means suffering is the real-time coming together of
factors to form temporary phenomena, and their real dissolution into
their parts to vanish. It also means that samsara (deluded
suffering experience as a whole) and Nirvana are mutually exclusive:
samsara, suffering, conditionality <em>really ends</em> in real-time,
and thereafter there is Nirvana, unconditionality. Suffering
really arises (First Noble Truth), produced by a real set of causes
which are really distinct from it (Second Noble Truth), and can really
cease in Nirvana at some point in time (Third Noble Truth), through the
cultivation of certain practices which cause this cessation, but which
are themselves really distinct from their effect (Fourth Noble
Truth). Both suffering, and its causes, and the cessation of
suffering, and its causes, are matters of arising and
perishing. </p>
<p>

This teaching is seen, in Tiantai as in many Mahayana schools, as
implying a fundamental contradiction that ensures it cannot be the
ultimate teaching. That contradiction is the idea that the
unconditioned, Nirvana, is something that can begin at a particular
place or time, that the unconditioned is itself conditioned. This is
precisely what is meant to be stressed by the Tiantai characterization
of this teaching as &ldquo;The Four Noble Truths as arising and
perishing.&rdquo; I will call this the Nirvana
paradox.  This problem is addressed with progressive
thoroughness in the following teachings.</p>

<h3>2. Shared Teaching:</h3>

<p>

This is the general Mahayana teaching, &ldquo;shared&rdquo; in all
school of Mahayana thought, and even implicit in the pre-Mahayana
teachings. It is the teaching of Emptiness associated with
many presentations of Madhyamaka thought and the
<em>Prajnaparamita</em> literature. The Nirvana paradox is
now addressed by asserting that all conditioned things are
<em>already</em> empty, even before impermanence shows them dissolving
into their component parts: they are empty in their very essence, they
have no self-nature from the beginning. In other words, if
seen correctly, all phenomena are already quiescent, have never arisen
and do not need to further be extinguished in Nirvana to be
extinct. They are in their own nature extinguished and
Nirvanic. All that is required is to see this essence of
essencelessness correctly. It is here that this teaching
tends toward a doctrine of Two Truths, easily merging into a kind of
appearance/reality split: in reality all things are unarising and
unperishing, having no self-nature and no actual characteristics, but
we mistakenly think we see entities and events as arising and perishing
in real-time. The latter is in this teaching regarded as
conventionally true, the former as ultimately true. 
Samsara, arising and perishing, a world of temporal separate objects
each with its own specific conditional nature, is, <em>if seen
correctly</em>, Nirvana itself: unarising, unperishing, producing
nothing, in no need of perishing, without any entities, without any
self-natures.</p>

<p>

This appearance/reality split, however, merely pushes the problem to
the next level: the unconditioned is no longer falsely thought to be
something operative only sometimes and to some, which is impossible,
but the cognition of this unconditioned is now thought to be
conditioned. This is not a logical contradiction anymore, but it
is still a religious and existential problem: for anything that is
conditioned is suffering, and if the attainment of this cognition is
conditioned, it is still suffering and not the end of suffering as
promised. This &ldquo;unhappy consciousness&rdquo; means
that the split between the conditioned and the unconditioned has been
exacerbated, not alleviated, by this attempt to solve the paradoxical
Tripitaka teaching of Nirvana as a unconditioned which is somehow also
conditioned. The next teaching addresses this problem.</p>

<h3>3. The Separate Teaching</h3>

<p>
The Separate Teaching (or &ldquo;Special&rdquo; Teaching). 
This is thought of first and foremost as a special teaching only for
bodhisattvas. These are beings who have made a compassionate vow
to liberate all beings by remaining in samsara for immeasurably vast
eons, to be born again and again, in body after body, so as to interact
with innumerable sentient beings, producing innumerable precisely
tailored and maximally effective teachings, and bodily forms, in
response to the individual vicissitudes of each of those encounters and
each of those challenges. These bodhisattvas have understood that
all things are empty; but they see that this is not merely the negation
of, and therefore the transcendence of, all determinate forms, but also
a negation of and transcendence of this negation and transcendence,
insofar as the first negation is itself something determinate (namely,
the definite exclusion of samsara, of all birth and death, of all
arising and perishing). They also see that transcending and
negating any specific form, liberation from any form, is done via the
creation of a counterbalancing or neutralizing form: 2 is neutralized
by &minus;2, not by 0. This means the liberation from all determinate
forms, the negation of all determinate forms, is done not through
universal blankness or universal destruction, but by limitless
creativity of forms, by the production in each case of the precisely
countervailing form. Liberative negation of all things
requires infinite creativity, and produces infinite forms. 
Transcending the transcendence (the emptiness of emptiness) does not
lead them into some even more unthinkable hypertranscendence, but into
a new mode of immanence. They do not straightaway embrace this
non-arising and non-perishing once and for all as an exclusion of all
arising and perishing, of all determinate existence. Rather they
see that this emptiness also means infinite <em>ambiguity</em>, i.e.,
lack of determinate identity and provisionally posited identity at
once. This emptiness is also a matrix of infinite
productivity of provisionally posited redescriptions and
re-presentations. </p>

<p>

For these bodhisattvas have not made the mistake of clinging to
&ldquo;emptiness&rdquo; as an objective truth about things, as if it
were a (true) ontological view about reality. 
&ldquo;All phenomena are empty of self-nature&rdquo; cannot mean that,
in reality and apart from the cognitive distortions added by sentient
cognizers, they have some specific objective characteristic called
&ldquo;being empty of self-nature.&rdquo; The
characterization of them as &ldquo;empty&rdquo; is also no more than a
part of certain sentient experiences. It happens to be one that
is especially effective for removing attachments to other types of
cognitions, i.e., all views that ascribe ontological reality of any
kind to independently existing entities, or that think there is
actually any entity that is born and dies, any substance that can arise
and perish. But that means Emptiness too is a truth for exactly
the same reason that any upayic claim might qualify as
&ldquo;conventionally true&rdquo;: it serves pragmatically as a raft,
as conducive to liberation from attachments, and therefore from
suffering, although it is not a literally true description of any facts
about the mind-independent world. &ldquo;All things
are empty&rdquo; is not more or less true than &ldquo;This cup is
blue,&rdquo; or for that matter, &ldquo;all things are cheese,&rdquo;
and all are true and false for the same reason: they serve in some
context as rafts that contribute to liberation by leading beyond
themselves. The Emptiness of Emptiness means that Emptiness
is a conventional truth, but also that any entity is no more literally
&ldquo;empty&rdquo; than it is literally, say, &ldquo;red&rdquo; or
&ldquo;round&rdquo; or &ldquo;bitter&rdquo; or
&ldquo;sweet.&rdquo; All Emptiness amounts to is the
non-finality of any characterization, including
&ldquo;Emptiness&rdquo;&mdash;which means emptiness amounts to the
positing always of <em>alternate</em> determinations and descriptions
for any entity, the validity of more descriptions beyond any finite set
that might have already been applied. This means that
Conventional Truth is not a single set of appearances, but is
constantly available for reshaping to meet new conventions and new
needs, and that all of these are simply further manifestations of
Emptiness, further rereadings of Emptiness itself. </p>

<p>
This deepened sense of Emptiness as identical with the production of
infinite provisional posits is called <em>the Center. </em> It is
neither the definite Emptiness nor any definite set of determinations:
it is the non-ultimacy of both of these extremes, and thus something
beyond both extremes that at the same time posits both
extremes. Both negation of definite characteristics
(Emptiness) and affirmation of them (Provisional Positing) are
alternate and opposite ways in which the same thing is
presented. </p>

<p>
To understand the meaning of &ldquo;Center,&rdquo; here, we might
picture this as a coin with an engraving on one side and left blank on
the other side. The engraving is the determinate forms of
the world as conventionally understood (from all points of view). 
The blank side is a further alternate revelation of what all of that
determinate reality is: the metal of the coin, here understood not to
be any specific substance or characteristic, but literally the lack of
all determinate characteristics. On the Shared Teaching
model, the unengraved side thus reveals the reality, the
&ldquo;Ultimate Truth,&rdquo; which is also what the unseen inside of
the coin is made of and even what the determinate forms of the
engraving are made of. But in the Separate Teaching, the
unengraved side is also seen as <em>a side,</em> merely one of two
sides, with the same status as the engraved side. Both are
merely ways of appearing. Even the unengraved is something
seen and cognized, and is in its own way determinate, precisely as the
definite negation of all the determinations of the engraved
side. What is concealed by and also appearing in these two
opposite forms is what lies between them, the unseen metal of the coin
between the two surfaces, which is itself neither the engraved
appearance (conventional truths) nor the unengraved appearance
(emptiness), but in another way is also immanent to both of them as
what appears in either form. The Two Truths, the
affirmation and the negation, can be said to be both two alternate
presentations of the same content, identical in substance but opposed
in form, just as the two sides of a coin are opposite and mutually
exclusive presentations of the substance of the coin that is between
the two sides. No matter which side we are looking at, we
are looking at the coin itself: so even if we are looking at the heads
side, what we are really seeing is the coin, and that means we are
seeing that which is the inner reality of the tails side, which is also
the coin (the Center). In this sense, &ldquo;looking at the
coin&rdquo; is identical to &ldquo;looking at the heads side&rdquo; and
identical to &ldquo;looking at the tails side,&rdquo; and through the
mediation of this central term seen variously from different sides, we
say that the sides are <em>really</em> identical to one another,
meaning by that, however, only that both of them are really identical
to the Central term. Thus it is called the Exclusive
Center, not because it does not include both sides but because it
includes them subordinately, as mere expressions of a deeper truth,
i.e., the Center itself conceived as what the two extremes have in
common and what produces both and also transcends both.  </p>

<p>

But we must break away from our static coin metaphor here, for we no
longer have only one fixed engraving on the engraved side. Motivated by
their infinitely compassionate vow to engage every specific form of
delusion, the non-produced Emptiness of all things is now seen as
<em>infinitely productive. </em> There are as many forms of
arising of suffering and ending of suffering, of causes of both, as
there are moments of sentient experience, as long as there are
bodhisattvas compassionately willing and skillful enough to create
<em>upayas</em>, skillful means, to engage them. So here we
have the &ldquo;unproduced producing,&rdquo; the &ldquo;infinite&rdquo;
productivity of sufferings and endings of sufferings, the
&ldquo;Center&rdquo; which is neither the absence of any arising or
perishing entities nor the real presence of any entities, but the
infinite productive power to produce temporary non-empty forms, and
also to keep them temporary and illusory, to return them to
emptiness&mdash;the ultimate reality of this compassionate creative
activity being thus neither emptiness nor non-emptiness, the
Center. This Center is identified with the Buddha-nature
described in the <em>Mahaparinirvanasutra</em><em>,</em> the
14<sup>th</sup> chapter of which defines Buddha-nature precisely as
&ldquo;the Middle Way.&rdquo; </p>

<p>

However, this &ldquo;separateness&rdquo; pertains here on all levels
under this form of &ldquo;creativity&rdquo; or
&ldquo;production&rdquo;: still implying a real difference between the
phases of not-yet-produced and produced, between the Empty
<em>aspect</em> and the Non-empty <em>aspect</em> of the
Center. This means also that these bodhisattvas understand
the phases of bodhisattva practice as really separate from one another:
phases of time are genuinely distinct. This applies also to
the relation between a &#347;rav&#257;ka (Hin&#257;y&#257;na
practitioner) and a bodhisattva, and between a bodhisattva and a
Buddha: these diverse phases of practice and the diverse phases of
realization take place in separate moments, to separate practitioners
and realizers. This again reproduces the gulf between the
absolute and the relative, the unconditioned and the
conditioned. More fundamentally, although both &ldquo;all
things are Empty&rdquo; and &ldquo;all things are Non-empty,&rdquo; so
that both &ldquo;this is a cup&rdquo; and &ldquo;this is a frog&rdquo;
are now equally true, none of these is as really true as &ldquo;both
are true.&rdquo; The Center is the collapsing of the
two sides, revealing that they are immediately one, that either side in
isolation is false. But this means that any deployment of either
side in isolation is now viewed as somehow different from their
deployment in non-isolation. This is the last level of
&ldquo;separateness&rdquo; to overcome. This problem is finally
resolved in the next step:</p>

<h3>4. The Perfect Teaching:</h3>

<p>

Recall that the Emptiness of Phase Two (the Shared Teaching) was
presupposed and accepted in Phase Three (the Separate Teaching), but
reinterpreted: Emptiness itself was now seen to be infinitely
productive, albeit of merely conventional, upayic, liberatively
fictional determinations. </p>
<p>

Similarly, the infinite productivity of new determinations by Emptiness
propounded in Phase Three (the Separate Teaching) is presupposed and
accepted in Phase Four (the Perfect Teaching), but
reinterpreted. </p>
<p>

In the Perfect Teaching, Emptiness is infinitely productive, but
everything it produces is now not merely a provisional and temporary
fiction, but an eternal and omnipresent truth, both unobtainable and
inescapable for all other beings. Each of the fictions of phase
Three turns out, in phase Four, to be the eternal omnipresent truth
that defines and determines all other things. Every fantasy is a
revelation of a new eternal truth that has always already been the
foundation of all other things since the infinite past and into the
infinite future. We thus have infinite alternate versions, each
of which serves as the infinite sole truth of the cosmos&mdash;infinite
infinities, infinite universes, which are also all the same universe
viewed in infinite alternate ways. Each of these alternate
universes, in turn, is all the others <em>as</em> this one, reversibly
intersubsumptive, so that in this precise sense they are neither one
universe nor many universes.</p>

<p>

How so? Recall that in the Separate Teaching, the
bodhisattva had come to see all things as both Empty and
Non-empty. The Emptiness allows him to produce infinite virtual
or fictive determinations, for the purpose of overcoming attachment to
both other fictive determinations and themselves, and leading to the
realization of this Emptiness and its infinite Non-empty power to
produce such phantasms and fictions. The fictional
determinations are rooted in and lead to Emptiness, and they also
&ldquo;embody&rdquo; Emptiness even while present. 
Fictive being and Emptiness are completely coextensive, collapsed into
one: precisely the fictive being is the Emptiness, precisely the
Emptiness is the fictive being, with neither side more true or ultimate
than the other. What is true and ultimate is the Center as
Neither-Empty-nor-Non-empty, functioning as infinite productivity
precisely as Emptiness. It is neither one-sidedly
unproductively Empty nor non-fictional substantial being, both of these
extremes now being seen as deluded separations of the two indivisible
aspects of the undivided Center. Having attained insight
into this, the bodhisattva does this creation of infinite fictions
deliberately, with clear self-knowledge, as a result of his or her vow,
her definite will. This is a &ldquo;separate&rdquo; or
&ldquo;special&rdquo; &#21029; power only of those who do deliberately
take this vow and endeavor to save all beings in this
way. </p>

<p>

But now, in the Perfect Teaching, this infinite productivity is
reinterpreted. The non-separability of any two entities, already
discovered in the Emptiness concept of Phase Two, is now applied to the
relation between all the phases and levels themselves&mdash;above all,
to the relation between &ldquo;the phase before making the vow and
becoming a bodhisattva&rdquo; and &ldquo;the phase after doing
so.&rdquo; It is no longer something that has to be done
deliberately, or something that is done only by certain beings. 
Following the lead of the <em>Lotus Sutra,</em> where it is shown in
what sense one can be a bodhisattva although (or even because) one does
not know it, bodhisattvahood is something that all beings are doing,
always, everywhere, whether they try to or not, and whether they know
it or not. </p>

<p>

We have already seen in the Separate teaching that the Emptiness
(ontological indeterminability) that produces, on the one hand, and the
infinite determinations that are produced, on the other, are not really
separate and not really different; they are merely two aspects of a
deeper reality, their unity, the Center. But now we must also see
that neither one in isolation is ever any different, in essence or in
function, from the Center which is both. Now we do not
collapse the two into one, but keep all three aspects distinct and
ineradicable, indeed as ultimate, while also seeing how each one does
what the Separate teaching thought only the Center did: immediately
unify the other two:</p>

<p>

1. The &ldquo;being&rdquo; side of infinite production is itself,
just qua production, already the Center: all those infinite virtual or
fictional determinations are always already discoverable just as much
(i.e., just as little!) in the pre-production state as in the
post-production state, and vice versa. For (as we&rsquo;ve
known since the Shared Teaching), if we search for a determinate
difference between the prior pre-productive state and the posterior
determinations, we find none. So &ldquo;Provisional
Positing,&rdquo; the world as pure flux and conditional causal process,
thought through, is already the Center. </p>

<p>

2. Looking only at the &ldquo;Emptiness&rdquo; side, we note
again the &ldquo;emptiness of emptiness&rdquo; not as hyperemptiness,
but as the emptiness even of the exclusion of all marks, so that it is
equally infinity of marks, of provisional positings (as we&rsquo;ve
known since the Separate Teaching)&mdash;emptiness by itself, thought
through, is already the Center. </p>
<p>

3. Conversely, the Center is never not also some provisional
posit and its emptiness. It never appears simply as such,
in isolation, <em>simpliciter</em>. Moreover,
&ldquo;Center,&rdquo; insofar as it says anything at all and is
therefore determinate, is a provisional posit. And
&ldquo;Center,&rdquo; like all determinate posits, is therefore itself
empty. </p>
<p>

This is the interfusion of the Three Truths (<em>yuanrong</em>
<em>sandi</em> &#22291;&#34701;&#19977;&#35558;), such that each truth
by itself is the Center, each by itself is a provisional posit, each by
itself is empty. We now have before us a way of being, in
the Tiantai phrase, &ldquo;the Center precisely as the peripheralness
of the periphery&rdquo; 
(<em>jibianerzhong</em>&#21363;&#37002;&#32780;&#20013;).</p>

<p>

Considering the relation between &ldquo;Provisional Posits,&rdquo;
i.e., those infinite fictional or virtual presences produced by and
identical to formlessness and attributelessness, we now see that the
positing of any determinacy per se is a Centering of all, and also an
Emptying of all. Each determinacy is found everywhere, and that
each does its Centering of all other determinacies in its own distinct
way. Each determinacy is a negation of all other things,
and thereby also of itself, and each in its own distinctive
way. Buddhahood is always already in bodhisattvahood, and
bodhisattvahood is never expunged in Buddhahood; they are inherently
entailed in each other. Similarly, the causes of suffering and
the suffering they produce; similarly, the causes of the end of
suffering and the end of suffering itself; similarly, suffering and the
end of suffering&mdash;in each case, when one realtime effect, or
infinite effects, are produced from causes which are distinct from
themselves, we now find they are not &ldquo;separate&rdquo; at all, but
&ldquo;integrated,&rdquo; discoverable on both sides of any dividing
boundary. Greed, anger and delusion are always discoverable
in Buddhahood; Buddhahood is always discoverable in greed, anger and
delusion. All things are produced from any one
thing&mdash;but nothing is produced, because all those things are
always discoverable also already within it, in the same
way. Suffering is Buddhahood, delusion is enlightenment,
but also vice versa. The work to be done is now not to
determine whether or not each thing is the center of the universe, but
in precisely what way precisely this thing centers the universe, how
being this precise being manifests in all other entities.</p>

<p>

Our coin metaphor must be further rethought here. In the Shared
Teaching (Phase Two), the blank side of the coin showed the real nature
of the coin, while the engraved side mere appearance. In
the Special Teaching (Phase Three), both the blank and the engraved
sides were mere appearances, both manifesting and concealing the Center
between them, which was understood simply to be something with the
ability to be seen equally as engraved or unengraved, which both
connected and separated them, their inseparability being the ultimate
truth behind either side even when expressed one way or the
other. This meant that the engraved is not
necessarily engraved in only one way. In its identity with the
unengraved, it is always a site for more and different engraving, hence
for infinite productivity. </p>

<p>

In the Perfect Teaching (Phase Four), all this remains the same as in
Phase Three, except for one thing: the Center is no longer
privileged. We do not collapse the two sides into the
Center. The unseen Center which is neither engraved nor
unengraved is no longer the &ldquo;real essence&rdquo; of the
coin. Nor is the totality of the three the real essence of
the coin: i.e., it is not a summation of the three, a whole including
these three separate and distinct parts, a thing with one engraved
side, one unengraved side and in addition the
neither-engraved-nor-unengraved metal between them which enables both,
both dividing them and holding them inseparably together. 
Rather, the whole true essence of the whole is found in <em>any</em> of
the three aspects, and any of the aspects is the whole true
essence. Now everything we said about the Center can
also be said about the engraved side, and also about the unengraved
side. The engraved side is what both unifies and divides
the Center and the unengraved side. The unengraved side is what
both unifies and divides the Center and the engraved side. 
Moreover, it is not only the blank side that negates the other two: the
Center also negates the other two, and the engraved side also negates
the other two. Moreover, it is not only the engraved side
that establishes itself as determinate and differentiated: the Center
is also established as determinate and differentiated, the blank side
is also established as determinate and differentiated. This
means that to understand the coin completely, it is enough to
understand the engraved side completely&mdash;for &ldquo;to be
engraved&rdquo; <em>means</em> to also have an unengraved side which is
a coequal expression of a neither-engraved-nor-unengraved Center that
unites, separates, and expresses itself as the two sides. 
Equally, it is enough to understand the unengraved side
completely&mdash;for to be unengraved <em>means</em> to also have an
engraved side which is a coequal expression of a
neither-engraved-nor-unengraved Center that unites, separates, and
expresses itself as the two sides. And equally, it is enough to
understand the neutral Center between a two-sided structure of engraved
and unengraved sides, both uniting and separating them, for that
<em>means</em> to be both engraved and unengraved, neither engraved nor
unengraved. So we can say the real unchanging omnipresent essence
of the coin is simply &ldquo;to be engraved&rdquo;&mdash;which is the
ultimately reality which is also expressed indirectly in being
unengraved and being neither
neither-engraved-nor-unengraved. We can also say that the
real unchanging omnipresent essence of the coin is simply &ldquo;to be
unengraved&rdquo;-- which is the ultimately reality which is also
expressed indirectly in being unengraved and being neither
neither-engraved-nor-unengraved. Put another way, whenever we are
seeing any engraving we are also seeing the unengraved, and also the
identity-as-contrast between the engraved and unengraved. The
engraved is no longer the &ldquo;other side&rdquo; of the unengraved,
they are no longer merely &ldquo;two sides of the same coin&rdquo; such
that only one appearance or manifestation or function can be seen at a
time. Even as aspects or expressions, they are no longer mutually
exclusive; instead they are all three mutually inclusive and mutually
identical. </p>

<p>

This has large consequences for our understanding not only of what it
means &ldquo;to be engraved&rdquo; as a general condition, but of the
specificity of any engraving as such, of any particular form and
characteristic that might appear in experience. In the
Special Teaching, we could look at a figure on the engraved
side&mdash;of a bird, let&rsquo;s say&mdash;and understand that what is
here present to us as bird-engraving is also present as metal, the
identity of which is equally expressed by what we see on the other side
as unengraved blank. We can even look at the bird and
deploy a shift of attention to experience a change of aspect, as when
we look at a wave as water and then shift to seeing the water as
wave. The bird is entirely the metal, the metal is entirely
the bird. The Shared Teaching sees the wave as reducible to
water; it is really water, only superficially wave (really metal, only
superficially bird). The Separate Teaching sees it
reversibly as water and as wave, as metal and bird, with neither more
ultimate or real than the other. What is more ultimate and
real than either, though, is the &ldquo;both-and/neither-nor&rdquo;
itself, the one hyperblank that can be experienced in two different
ways, as blank and nonblank, but never both at the same
time. But the Perfect Teaching takes the Separate Teaching
point about the unengraved blankness of the blank side more seriously
than the Separate Teaching itself does: it is no longer understood as
merely blank in the sense that would exclude all engraving: it is now
understood as itself one more determinate form, rather than the absence
of all form; blankness too is &ldquo;an engraving&rdquo; of sorts, a
way of shaping the metal, a way of expressing the Center. 
This means two different engravings are copresent in and as each
engraving: the bird (which is an engraving) and the non-bird (the
non-engraving, which is also no more than a certain way of
engraving). Each determination, precisely insofar as it is
a determination, already alternate determinations. For since one
of these engravings (the non-bird, the blankness) is also
&ldquo;engravability in alternate ways&rdquo; as such, and indeed not
just &ldquo;alternate engrav<em>ability</em><em>,&rdquo;</em> but
&ldquo;alternate engraved<em>ness</em>, being at the same time
otherwise engraved,&rdquo; &ldquo;being bird&rdquo; and &ldquo;being
any other engraving&rdquo; have converged in the very engraving of the
bird. Put another way, the fact that both are
themselves really nothing but the Center means that &ldquo;to be
blankness&rdquo; already <em>means</em> also &ldquo;to be engraved on
its other side.&rdquo; But not only on its other side: now we see
even blankness as a kind of engraving, and given that blankness now
means &ldquo;also being a kind of engraving,&rdquo; i.e., to be both
determined-as-blank and determined-as-nonblank, to be Center, we thus
also see engraving as a kind of &ldquo;blankness&rdquo; (now understood
in this new way, as synonymous with Center). We can thus now
<em>see</em> both blank and unblank, bird and non-bird, at once, and to
really see what blank is is to be seeing all engravings (as the other
side of this blank, its alternate engravedness). </p>

<p>

So when we look at the metal composing the bird figure, we do not see
it as a blank, as in a matter/form relation in a hylomorphism, but
rather as a copresent alternate form, and see this &ldquo;blank&rdquo;
metal form as itself inseparable from all other forms, all the forms on
its engraved flipside. &ldquo;Metal&rdquo; here must
not be thought of as essentially the uncarved; the characteristic of
metal is to be both engraved and unengraved at the same time&mdash;to
be double-sided. So when I see the &ldquo;metal&rdquo; of
the &ldquo;bird,&rdquo; I should be seeing the doubleness of the bird
as well as the blank unengravedness of the other side. To
do that, I don&rsquo;t need to flip mentally between aspects: I just
need an enhanced understanding of what a &ldquo;bird&rdquo; is, of what
any determinate shape is. To see any determinate item, any
engraved item (any definite entity), is now to see it as an engraving
(=as dependently co-arisen), which is to see it also as what is
revealed in the unengraved side, i.e., that the substance of the coin
is as much the infinitely-engravable-unengraved (=empty) as it is
whatever is engraved on the other side, and the engraving is engraving
of just this. And this is now also to see this &ldquo;also&rdquo;
itself, the identity between the two (the Center). To see
one side is now also to see the other side, and to see either is to see
the middle between them which is both and neither, but now no longer
seeing the two extremes as reducible to the Center but not vice versa,
but seeing each of them as mutually reducible to the other
two. I look at feather on the bird and I see feather,
blankness, and the copresence of feather and blankness, but I see them
now as one experience, as all identical to each other, as three
synonyms for the same referent. Thus blankness is not
merely blankness but all-alternate-engravednesses: I see at once
feather, claw, eye, beak, blankness, copresence of all of the above,
separation of all of the above. Its definiteness is its
engravedness, and engravedness is itself now seen as none other than
the infinitely-alternately-engraved-unengraved itself, for to see
engravedness is a way of seeing a side of the coin, and seeing a side
of the coin is a way of seeing the coin itself, the center manifested
in its two alternate ways, which are also its infinite alternate
ways. Since the engraved side is now, as established in the
Special Teaching, an infinity of alternate engravings, this also means
that all possible creative actions are uncreated and unconditional,
salvific, Nirvanic, Buddhific, all-pervasive, eternal, effortless in
and as their very finitude, suffering, transience, and struggle.</p>

<p>

Practically speaking, this means that one need no longer find a
special form of activity which is the perfect coinciding of emptiness
and infinite creativity, as in the Separate Teaching. It means
that one is always already doing so, no matter what one does. 
This includes even not discovering the Three Truths and not cultivating
meditation in any way&mdash;for those times when one is not doing so
are always pervaded by other times when you, or someone else,
is. In the Separate Teaching, full realization of the
Center, doing all deeds in the mode of deep Samadhi and wisdom such
that one was completely emptiness and completely active at once,
allowed one to see that it was always both infinitely creative of new
forms and always formless, always committed to new activities and
always quiescent. Now in the Perfect Teaching, the full
realization of <em>any</em> activity, or <em>any</em> inactivity, any
being or any negation of being, is enough: to fully realize it, to be
fully submerged in it to its bottomless bottom, is to reveal that is
always both the Center and the other extreme. Hence, as
Zhiyi says, paraphrasing the protagonist of the chapter 20 of the
<em>Lotus Sutra:</em> &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to change your
present path or get out of your present wheel-rut: what you are
practicing now is the bodhisattva way.&rdquo; </p>

<p>

The Shared Teached had already refuted the idea that anything really
begins or perishes (<em>wusheng</em> &#28961;&#29983;). The
Separate Teaching then added a sense of subjective agency of
bodhisattvas&mdash;and by extension the activity of all sentient
beings, which serve as necessary conditions for this agency of
bodhisattvas&mdash;who provide the appearances of beginnings and
endings of finite determinate beings, who &ldquo;make of&rdquo; this
indeterminate reality one thing or another, who see it in infinite
various ways, who produce fictions either wittingly (as with
bodhisattvas) or unwittingly (as with everyone
else). This sense of beginnings and endings
within the subjectivity of sentient beings, as a result of their
deliberate agency, is the sense that is denied in Zhiyi&rsquo;s use of
the term &ldquo;unmade&rdquo; &#28961;&#20316; for the Perfect
Teaching. It is a denial not of beginning and ending, long
already established, but a denial of the second order subjective
appearance of beginnings and endings as nonnegotiable, once-and-for-all
&ldquo;facts.&rdquo; Not only is the reality beneath
all our fictions and illusions an indeterminate Emptiness that never
arises or perishes; our fictions and illusions themselves, in their
infinite arisings and perishings, never arise or perish. The
nature of this subjectivity is such that there are no facts of the
matter about its states: it is its own rewriting and reinterpretation
all prior and future facts at every moment. The
upshot of this for Zhiyi is that not only do no things arise or perish,
but no <em>illusions</em> about things arising or perishing arise or
perish either, not because these illusions are not there, but because
they are always and irrevocably there: each of those illusions is
eternal and omnipresent, interpenetrating with all alternate
illusions. </p>

<p>

What is important here for Zhiyi is specifically a denial of agency and
intentional action. The term <em>wuzuo</em>
&#28961;&#20316;implies &ldquo;unbegun&rdquo; in the sense of not
undertaking or beginning to commit a particular deed, not
<em>deliberately</em> made or begun. What is &ldquo;unmade&rdquo;
or &ldquo;undone&rdquo; in this sense is explained to be effortless and
unintentional. This is &ldquo;effortless&rdquo; in the same
sense that a thing with what (pre-Buddhistically) is imagined to be a
green &ldquo;essence&rdquo; requires no extra effort to express or
&ldquo;do&rdquo; greenness, or a person with an angry
&ldquo;nature&rdquo; expresses anger when he is making no special
effort: they are just being and expressing what they &ldquo;are.&rdquo;
 Of course ideas like &ldquo;what they are,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;their essence,&rdquo; have been systematically demolished in
pre-Tiantai Buddhism, for all finite essences. Now they are
reinstated in a radical new sense: all things really do behave like an
&ldquo;essence&rdquo; was believed to behave&mdash;effortlessly and
uninterruptibly being what it is and doing what it does ineradicably
and unconditionally. But now these are understood neither
as separate individual essences nor as one undifferentiated essence
shared by all things. Rather, <em>precisely qua essence</em>,
they are intersubsumptive of one another&mdash;for
&ldquo;essence&rdquo; here means literally unchangeable, not just in a
finite range of existence, but omnipresently and omnitemporally. 
That is, every determinate characteristic is an essence&mdash;and hence
unconditional, unchangeable--which inheres in its antecedents and
consequences, but also inheres in all other determinate individual
nature: <em>all</em> individual essences pre-exist in the preconditions
of any event, and remain unchanged in all consequences. All Three
Thousands inhere in every moment of experience</p>

<p>

And it is in this way that precisely as impermanent, all these things
are permanent&mdash;permanent and impermanent now are seen to be strict
synonyms. For all impermanent entities are found to be
pervading all other impermanent entities, pervading all times and
places, eternal and omnipresent&mdash;but precisely insofar as they
have no self-nature of their own, and are always also interpretable as
identical to any other entity, even as their own putative
exclusion. Thus there is no longer need for deliberate
intention to accomplish the compassionate deeds of the bodhisattva or a
Buddha: whatever he finds himself doing, he finds has always been an
ineradicable part of his own nature, which is just acting as it must
act, expressing itself without having to add any deliberate
augmentation in this form. Hence we speak here of &ldquo;the
unmade&rdquo;&mdash;meaning that even though all things are constantly
and eternally creating new karmic results, each new creation is thereby
found to be unmade, uncreated, eternal, all-pervasive, unconditional,
and thus salvific. </p>

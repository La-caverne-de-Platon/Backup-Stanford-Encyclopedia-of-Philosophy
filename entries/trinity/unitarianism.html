<h3><a name="Ter">1. Terminology</a></h3>

<p>
The term &ldquo;unitarian&rdquo; was popularized in late 1680s
England as a less pejorative and more descriptive term than
&ldquo;Socinian&rdquo;for Christians who hold God to be identical to
one and only one divine self, the Father. It has since been used as a
denominational label for several distinct groups, but it is here
primarily used in the descriptive, generic sense just stated. (The
capitalized &ldquo;Unitarian&rdquo; is occasionally used here in the
denominational sense.) All these groups have been labeled
&ldquo;antitrinitarian&rdquo;. Although many unitarians have proudly
flown the antitrinitarian banner, others strenuously argued that they
expounded the correct trinitarian doctrine, the difference being that
the former were promoting rival denominations, while the latter sought
to be included in mainstream groups (i.e., traditionally trinitarian
churches, or ones which were often assumed to be).</p>

<p>
Dating back at least to John Newman&rsquo;s (1801&ndash;90) critique of
Arius, a popular narrative among mainstream trinitarians is that it is
mainly &ldquo;rationalists&rdquo; who reject mainstream
trinitarianism, meaning something like: people who refuse to believe
things they can&rsquo;t fully understand or can&rsquo;t explain, even when those
things are divinely revealed (Newman 1890, 221; Williams 2001,
2&ndash;6). The term &ldquo;rationalist&rdquo; implies some sort of
epistemic over-confidence or dogmatism, and usually suggests some
underlying moral or spiritual defect(s) as well (e.g., Newman 1890,
xiii, 18&ndash;24, 133&ndash;42, 219&ndash;30). This narrative
received impetus from late 18th and 19th century English and American
Unitarianism, which also revised some other Christian doctrines. (See
 <a href="#18t21sCenUni">section 4</a> below.)
 Further, &ldquo;philosophical&rdquo; (non-biblical) objections have at
times been emphasized. Various trinitarian claims, especially those in
the &ldquo;Athanasian&rdquo; creed, have been criticized as
inconsistent. And various claims (e.g., that the three enjoy
&ldquo;perichoresis&rdquo;) have been criticized as
unintelligible. The rationalist explanation, though, is inadequate, as
unitarians&rsquo; views on the Bible, the place of reason, the usefulness of
philosophy, the authority of tradition, miracles, and ecclesiology run
the gamut&mdash; Anabaptists, Anglicans, Catholics,
Congregationalists, deists, Presbyterians, and denominational
Unitarians appear in their ranks. The kernels of truth here are that
most unitarians hold that <em>some</em> elements of some Trinity and
Incarnation doctrines are self-contradictory, and they typically
reject mysterian theology. (See main
entry <a href="index-2.html#Mys">section 3</a>.)</p>

<p>
Most unitarians have led with and emphasized the objection that
the Bible provides little to no support for mainstream trinitarianism,
and teaches things inconsistent with it. Further, some trinitarian
proof texts (e.g., 1 John 5:7) are later interpolations, while others
have been mistranslated (e.g., the application of personal pronouns to
the holy spirit). Some make a detailed case that New Testament era and
early patristic Christianity was in some sense unitarian (Clarke <em>Scripture</em>;
Lamson 1875; Priestley <em>History</em>). While some ridicule all appeals to
&ldquo;mystery&rdquo; others accept them in principle, arguing that</p>

<blockquote>
  The true <em>Veneration of Mysteries</em> consists, not in
  <em>making them</em> ourselves, and in receiving blindly
  the <em>Words of Men</em> without understanding them; but it
  consists&hellip; in taking care <em>there</em> to <em>stop</em>,
  where the Scripture itself has stopped&hellip; (Clarke <em>Scripture</em>,
  xiii; cf. Crellius 1691, 245&ndash;6)
</blockquote>

<h3><a name="16t17tCenSocUni">2. 16th and 17th Century Socinianism and Unitarianism</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Socini">2.1 Socinians</a></h4>

<p>
In the Reformation era, many individuals sought to revise or reject
Trinity theories based on their own studies of the Bible, and
influenced by the biblical scholarship of Erasmus of Rotterdam
(d. 1536) (Williams 2000, 42&ndash;6).Some of these held that the
Father alone is God, that Jesus Christ had only a human nature, and
that the Holy Spirit is a divine power (of the Father, God), and not a
divine person (Lindsey 1818, 14&ndash;7; Wilbur 1925, ch.  15&ndash;6;
Williams 2000, 1135&ndash;61).</p>

<p>
The history of such groups is complex. For example, a body of these
Christians in Poland followed the forceful Italian theologian Faustus
Socinus (or Fausto Paolo Sozzini, 1539&ndash;1604), and were
thereafter dubbed &ldquo;Socinians&rdquo; by their opponents. The term
came to be used by some as a derogatory expression for any sort of
unitarian. This tradition, centered in Rakow in Poland, flourished
until 1660 when its members were forced by governmental persecution to
flee the country. But in its heyday, soon after the death of Socinus,
the first edition of the <em>Racovian Catechism</em> was
published. This book was the end result of a commission given to
Socinus and three other ministers to revise an earlier Polish
catechism. Later versions of this in Latin and other languages have
repeatedly influenced later unitarians (Rees 1818, lxxi-lxxviii;
Williams 1967).</p>

<p>
This <em>Racovian Catechism</em> identifies the God of Israel with the
Father of Christ, engaging all the major passages commonly brought to
bear as evidence for a Trinity of persons in God. Both the Trinity and
the doctrine of two natures (divine and human) in Christ are argued to
be both contradictory and unsupported by the Bible. It is argued that
Christ is a man who did not pre-exist his miraculous conception in
Mary, though he&rsquo;s denied to be a &ldquo;mere&rdquo; man, but affirmed
to be the unique Son of God, the Messiah, worthy of worship and a
proper recipient of prayer (Crellius, et al. <em>Racovian</em>).</p>

<p>
Worship of and prayer to Christ had been a bone of contention earlier;
Socinus famously debated the Hungarian unitarian Ferenc D&aacute;vid
(a.k.a. Francis David, ca. 1510&ndash;79) on this point, the latter
vehemently denying the appropriateness of worshiping or praying to any
being but God. D&aacute;vid later argued that worship and prayer to
Christ are as inappropriate and ungrounded in scripture as the
Catholic cults of Mary and the saints. Had it been God&rsquo;s will for us
to worship or pray to Christ, such would have been explicitly
commanded somewhere in scripture. But as Socinus admits, there are no
such commands. Therefore, it is not God&rsquo;s will for us to worship or
pray to Christ. Socinus made a stand on passages such as &ldquo;let
all the angels of God worship [Christ]&rdquo; (Hebrews 1:6), defending
worship and prayer to Christ as permissible but not required for
salvation. Later, he and his successors made these obligatory, adding
that Christ was the intermediate, but his Father the ultimate object
of worship (Crellius <em>Racovian</em>, 196&ndash;7; Lindsey 1783,
152&ndash;93, 237&ndash;64; Rees 1818, xli&ndash;lxii; Wilbur 1925,
ch. 22). A small stream of unitarianism deriving from the Ferenc
D&aacute;vid survives to this day in Transylvania (part of present-day
Romania).</p>

<h4><a name="JohBid">2.2 John Biddle</a></h4>

<p>
Influenced by his reading of the New Testament, and then by some Latin
writings of the Polish unitarian diaspora (including the
<em>Racovian Catechism</em>), Englishman John Biddle (a.k.a. Bidle)
(1615&ndash;62) was the focus of a small unitarian movement, which
seems to have ended with his early death (Lindsey 1783, 301f; Wilbur
1925, Ch. 28). Biddle identified the Father with the one God, Yahweh
the God of the Jews, and argued that the Bible teaches that Christ is
a human (with only a human nature), who is nonetheless worthy of being
called &ldquo;God&rdquo; by virtue of his immortality, and his
supernatural and benevolent dominion (Biddle 1691, 1&ndash;3,
8&ndash;17). He held the Holy Spirit to be a personal agent, not
divine, but created, who is in his words,</p>

<blockquote>
  &hellip;chief of all ministering spirits&hellip; in the third rank
  after God and Christ&hellip; So that as there is one principal
  spirit amongst the evil angels [Satan]&hellip; even so there is one
  principal spirit&hellip; amongst the good angels&hellip; (Toulmin
  1791, 29)
</blockquote>

<p>
God created the cosmos by means of the personal agency of the Holy
Spirit; the Son wasn&rsquo;t involved, but later the man Jesus became
&ldquo;the second Cause of all Things pertaining to our Salvation, and
consequently, the intermediate Object of our Faith and Worship&rdquo;
(Biddle 1691, 4). Biddle&rsquo;s writings drew a massive refutation from
Puritan theologian John Owen (1616&ndash;83)
(Owen <em>Vindiciae</em>).</p>

<h4><a name="LonTri">2.3 The London Trinity Controversies (1687&ndash;98)</a></h4>

<p>
Thomas Firmin (1632&ndash;97), who had attended Biddle&rsquo;s meetings as a
young man, later became a successful businessman and respected
philanthropist in London. In 1687 Firmin published the first of many
writings promoting a kind of unitarianism, a tract by minister Stephen
Nye (1648&ndash;1719) entitled <em>A Brief History of the Unitarians, Called
also Socinians. In Four Letters, Written to a Friend</em> (Nye 1691b)
Despite the title, this is a closely argued polemic against mainstream
views on the Trinity, arguing from the Bible and rebutting the major
texts usually given to support the orthodox (Athanasian, pro-Nicene, or
Latin) doctrine. Further,</p>

<blockquote>
  Theirs [i.e., the unitarians&rsquo;] (they say) is an accountable and a
  reasonable Faith; but that of the <em>Trinitarians</em> is absurd,
  and contrary both to Reason and <em>to It-self</em>, and therefore
  not only false, but <em>impossible.</em> For you, say they teach,
  That there are Three <em>Almighty, most Good and most Wise</em>
  Persons, and yet but One God; as if every <em>Almighty most Wise and
  Good Person</em> were not a God, a most perfect God; and
  consequently Three such Persons, Three Gods. You add yet more
  absurdly, That there are three Persons who are <em>severally and
  each of them</em> true God, and yet there is but one true God. This
  is <em>an Errour in counting or numbring</em>; which, when stood in,
  is of all others the most brutal and inexcusable: and not to discern
  it, is not to be a Man. But we would not, say they, trouble our
  selves at the Non-sense of this Doctrine, if it did not impose false
  Gods on us; by advancing Two to be Gods, who are not so: and rob
  also the One true God of the Honour due to him, and of which he is
  jealous. (Nye 1691b, 9, original emphases)
</blockquote>

<p>
As with Biddle and the <em>Racovian Catechism</em>, Christ is a unique
servant of God and the messiah, possessing a human nature only.
Against Biddle, the Holy Spirit is just the power of God (Nye 1691b,
7&ndash;8).</p>

<p>
There ensued a heated controversy within the Anglican church
concerning the doctrine of the Trinity. (Walker 2013, 157&ndash;251)
Firmin&rsquo;s side urged that since the Bible doesn&rsquo;t teach the traditional
doctrine of the Trinity, the Anglican church, being Protestant, should
tolerate and welcome unitarians. To the delight of the unitarians, two
prominent Oxford professors published books propounding contrary
views, but both purporting to defend &ldquo;the&rdquo; doctrine of the
Trinity. William Sherlock (c.1641&ndash;1707) argued for what was
widely derided as tritheism, as he called the three persons of the
Trinity three infinite minds, substances, spirits, and intelligent
beings, each a God, but existing as one God because of their perfect
mutual consciousness, their
<em>perichoresis</em>. Against him, John Wallis (1616&ndash;1703)
propounded the pro-Nicene view that we can&rsquo;t grasp the meaning of
&ldquo;person&rdquo; applied to the Trinity, but gave analogies which
suggested modalism about the three (three dimensions of a cube, a
soul&rsquo;s existence, knowledge, and action), in the form of the
&ldquo;persons&rdquo; being properties of God. (See supplementary
document on the history of trinitarian doctrines
 <a href="trinity-history.html#ProNicCon">section 3.3</a>.)
 These two engaged in a nasty public quarrel (with several
others joining in the fray), and the views of Sherlock were eventually
condemned by his university as &ldquo;false, impious, and heretical&rdquo;. For
their part, the unitarians were happy to exploit the evident divisions in
the trinitarian camp (Dixon 2003, 125&ndash;9; Nye 1693).</p>

<p>
At one point in the debate, Sherlock argued that the unitarians were
as much trinitarians as Wallis was (Hunt 1871, 201&ndash;21). Firmin
and many in his party, it seems, agreed. They argued in several tracts
that there is only a verbal disagreement between themselves and the
orthodox trinitarians. Both may be called &ldquo;nominal
trinitarians&rdquo;, who hold that there are three
&ldquo;persons&rdquo; in God not in the sense of three selves or
subjects of consciousness, but in the sense of three distinctions
within, properties of, or relations in God, such as Augustine&rsquo;s mind,
wisdom, and love (Dixon 2003, 131; Hunt 1871, 220; Wilbur 1925,
ch. 29). (Cf. supplementary document on the history of trinitarian
doctrines
 <a href="trinity-history.html#Aug"> section 3.3.2</a>.)
 In short, as the Anglican church had repudiated
tritheism, the unitarians felt that their concerns about upholding
God&rsquo;s uniqueness had been satisfied. The idea that Sabellianism,
unitarianism, and nominal trinitarianism differ only verbally,
continued for some time, dubious though it may be. (Depending on how
they are defined, they&rsquo;ll probably differ with respect to christology,
an area not much in focus in that controversy.)</p>

<p>
For his part, in 1701 Nye declared himself orthodox, repudiated at
least some of his previous writings, and proceeded to expound a
one-self Trinity theory on which a &ldquo;person&rdquo; in God
&ldquo;is only a mode or Property; as such Mode is considered together
with the Divine Essence, Godhead, or God.&rdquo; Nye also sounded
notes of pro-Nicene style mysterianism (see main entry
 <a href="index-2.html#Mys">section 3</a>),
 and defended his views 
from the charge of heretical modalism by insisting that his three
person-modes were internal to God, i.e., God&rsquo;s intrinsic
properties (Dixon 2003, 172&ndash;4).</p>

<h3><a name="Sub">3. Subordinationism</a></h3>

<p>
Subordinationists hold that the Son is divine but is nonetheless in
some sense ontologically dependent on God, that is, the Father. (Some
also allege a similar dependence of the Holy Spirit on the Father.)
Its proponents argue that there is a strong strain of subordinationist
thinking about the Son in most of the church fathers prior to the 4th
century.  (Anti-subordinationists often counter that this strain is
exaggerated or partly due to misinterpretation of those ancient
writers.) Current patristic scholars tend to hold that this early
subordinationism has been downplayed by church historians because it
is unorthodox relative to later standards, although they sometimes
find counterbalancing themes in many writers inconsistent with
subordinationism. Clear and well-developed subordinationist
unitarianism mainly belongs to two periods of history, the fourth and
the eighteenth centuries.</p>

<h4><a name="FouCenAriSub">3.1 Fourth-Century &ldquo;Arian&rdquo; Subordinationists</a></h4>

<p>
Recent scholarship has illuminated the views of that groups of
fourth-century theologians called &ldquo;Arians&rdquo;,
&ldquo;semi-Arians&rdquo; (&ldquo;homoian Arians&rdquo;), and
&ldquo;neo-Arians&rdquo; (sometimes called &ldquo;anhomoian
Arians&rdquo;)  (Hanson 1988; Kopecek 1979; Wiles 1996; Williams
2001). Here we can only give a rough sketch of this loose family of
fourth-century theories.  All these terms but the first were coined by
19th and 20th century scholars. The term &ldquo;Arian&rdquo; was
bestowed on them by their fierce opponent Athanasius in order to
associate them with the formally condemned Arius. (See
 <a href="trinity-history.html#325381AriCon">section 3.2</a>
 of the supplementary document on the history of trinitarian
doctrines.)  These &ldquo;Arians&rdquo; were aggressively denounced by
Athanasius, who argued (in the summary of a recent scholar) that their
&ldquo;appeal to reason is sophistic, their appeal to Scripture a
pretence, and their appeal to tradition an insult&rdquo; (Wiles 1996,
9).</p>

<p>
While Athanasius&rsquo; terminology and harsh critique have been massively
influential, recent scholars have sought to understand these
&ldquo;Arians&rdquo; in their own terms. Arius was neither the origin
of, nor the leader of most of this group of theologians, and thus they
rejected the label. It has been suggested that this terminology be
scrapped or used with quotes (Wiles 1996, 4). Accordingly, we here
call them &ldquo;Arian subordinationists&rdquo;, for they did
hold, in different ways, that the Son (and less clearly, the Holy
Spirit) were subordinate to the Father in ways which the emerging
pro-Nicene consensus would reject.</p>

<p>
These &ldquo;Arian&rdquo; subordinationists shared with their third-century
antagonists a basic approach to reading the Bible, on which God&rsquo;s word
and spirit are in some sense distinct from him but also in some sense
on a par with him. Again, like their opponents, they held that Proverbs
8 reveals the origin of this Wisdom (&ldquo;Word&rdquo; or <em>logos</em>) which
later became incarnate (John 1).</p>

<blockquote>
  The Lord created me [Wisdom] at the beginning of his work, the first
  of his acts of long ago. Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before
  the beginning of the earth. When there were no depths I was brought
  forth, when there were no springs abounding with water. Before the
  mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth
  when he had not yet made earth and fields&hellip; when he assigned
  to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his
  command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was
  beside him, like a master worker; and I was daily his delight,
  rejoicing before him always, rejoicing in his inhabited world and
  delighting in the human race. (Proverbs 8:22&ndash;31, NRSV)
</blockquote>

<p>
Whereas their opponents distinguished creating from timeless
&ldquo;begetting&rdquo;, some of these subordinationists took the
above passage to teach that the Son of God was created prior to the
creation of the cosmos. Others held that the Son has been eternally
and ineffably or mysteriously &ldquo;generated&rdquo; by the Father
rather than created in the normal sense. Some affirmed, and others
denied that the Son was &ldquo;made from nothing&rdquo;. In any case,
the Son bears a unique relation to the Father, being the only thing
that comes directly and only from him. Based on various other passages
they held that through this second god, the one true God, the Father,
created everything else, which they thought preserved God&rsquo;s
transcendence. They rejected the new description of the Son as
&ldquo;consubstantial&rdquo; (<em>homoousios</em>) with the Father as
wrongheadedly materialistic (i.e., the Son came to be when some of the
Father&rsquo;s matter was separated from him), as inconsistently involving
the impassible, immutable, and incorruptible God in the sufferings and
death of Christ, or as compromising the primacy and uniqueness of the
one true God, the Father, or as implying (as a form of
modalism&mdash;see the main entry, 
 <a href="index-2.html#OneSel">section 1</a>)
 that the three are in fact one person (&ldquo;confounding the
persons&rdquo;, as they sometimes put it), or as implicitly denying
monotheism.</p>

<p>
Some of the earlier &ldquo;Arians&rdquo; thought that even the Son
couldn&rsquo;t understand the ineffable God, while some of the latter
&ldquo;neo-Arians&rdquo; thought he could. The Son&rsquo;s incarnation
involved his taking on a soul-less human body. Like their opponents,
they held that a merely human Christ could not save humankind,
although they denied that his redeemer status requires him to be (as
it was later put) &ldquo;fully divine&rdquo; and &ldquo;ontologically
equal to&rdquo; the Father. They held that a god must suffer to redeem
us, but the one true God is incapable of suffering.  The Son is worthy
of worship, or something close to it, and it is through the Son that
we know and worship the Father. Less was said of the Spirit, although
some held him to be an agent subordinate to both the Father and Son,
some considering the Spirit to be &ldquo;the noblest of the creatures,
produced by the Son at the Father&rsquo;s bidding, the source of
illumination and sanctification&rdquo; (Kelly 1978, 256).</p>

<p>
In sum, they took themselves to be conservative traditionalists,
following or developing a subordinationist strand of earlier theology,
wherein the Son is in some sense divine, though he derives his divine
qualities from the will of the Father. Several recent scholars have
pointed out that</p>

<blockquote>
  &hellip;in the intellectual climate of the fourth century, it was
  quite logical to maintain that the Son was God or divine while not
  being fully equal to the Father, and&hellip; the assumption that
  there was no plausible halting-place between full divinity and
  ordinary creaturely status was by no means obvious. (Hanson 1988,
  574)
</blockquote>

<p>
Although some polemical writers have painted these
&ldquo;Arians&rdquo; as &ldquo;rationalists&rdquo; or presumptuous
speculators, the philosophies of the day seem to have influenced and
been appropriated by them to about the same degree as their pro-Nicene
antagonists, and in general their views seem no more speculative than
those of their opponents. Various members of each party put more or
less weight on philosophical distinctions and arguments. It is true
that one party of the subordinationists, the so-called
&ldquo;Neo-Arians&rdquo;, seemed to emphasize philosophical precision
and argument, and upheld (contrary to the emerging pro-Nicene view)
that God is in some sense comprehensible by us (Hanson 1988,
3&ndash;128, 557&ndash;638; Wiles 1996, 17&ndash;23).</p>

<h4><a name="17t18tCenEngSub">3.2 17th&ndash;18th Century English Subordinationists</a></h4>

<p>
A number of late 17th century and early 18th century
English thinkers came to hold subordinationist views. A seminal figure
was the great physicist
 <a href="../newton/index.html">Isaac Newton</a> (1642&ndash;1727),
who was as concerned with Christian theology as he was with
physics. He was too cautious to publish his subordinationist views
during his lifetime, but two of his younger associates became famous
for propounding views similar to his (Mandlebrote 2005; Wiles 1996,
76). One of these was the man who succeeded him as Lucasian professor
of Mathematics at Cambridge, the eccentric but principled William
Whiston (1667&ndash;1752) (Wiles 1996, 76&ndash;93). Unlike most
other subordinationists, Whiston accepted the &ldquo;Arian&rdquo;
label (though preferring &ldquo;Eusebian&rdquo; or simply
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo;, and strove (unsuccessfully) to revive what he
considered &ldquo;primitive Christianity&rdquo; outside the confines
of Anglicanism. Again, unlike the others, Whiston embraced the claim
that Christ a creature, although created in an different way than all
other creatures, and created prior to the cosmos (Wiles 1996,
97&ndash;9). All of them framed the issue as being fundamentally
between the clear teaching of the scriptures together with the early
church fathers and the &ldquo;Athanasian&rdquo; doctrine of the
Trinity. They held that Athanasius was at best a shady character, and
that the theory he proposed was unscriptural and unreasonable. In its
place, they held what they considered the genuinely scriptural
doctrine of the Trinity. The best developed such theory to emerge from
this circle is that of
 <a href="../clarke/index.html">Samuel Clarke</a>
(1675&ndash;1729) (Clarke <em>Scripture</em>; Ferguson 1976; Pfizenmaier 1997;
Wiles 1996, 110&ndash;34).</p>

<p>
Inspired by the elder Newton, Clarke seems to have scoured the New
Testament and early church fathers some time in the early years of the
century. In 1712 he published the first edition of his <em>The
Scripture-Doctrine of the Trinity</em>
(Clarke, <em>Scripture</em>). Here he first lists fifty-five
propositions which express the essence of his theory. Clarke then
lists and classifies every passage in the New Testament relevant to
trinitarian doctrine, comments on the important ones, and gives dozens
of quotations (translated, together with the original language) of
ante-Nicene church Fathers in order to support the interpretations
offered. Each of the aforementioned propositions is then (allegedly)
deduced from the scriptural evidence, and explicated and defended. In
the final section of the book, Clarke dares to suggest revisions to
the liturgy of the Anglican church, purging various
&ldquo;Athanasian&rdquo; elements.  The book is notable for its
careful argumentation, clarity, brevity, and close interaction with
pre-Nicene catholic theology. This controversial and widely read book
generated dozens of responses (Ferguson 1976, 119&ndash;49; Hunt 1873,
24&ndash;9; Pfizenmaier 1997, 179&ndash;216; Van Mildert 1856,
28&ndash;81), and went through three editions during Clarke&rsquo;s life and
one shortly after. Clarke and a few allies wrote several defenses of
it, and its core account remained unchanged through the editions.</p>

<p>
The core of Clarke&rsquo;s subordinationism is as follows. Certain names or
titles in the Bible, including &ldquo;God&rdquo;, always are nearly
always refer to the Father, giving him a kind of primacy among the
three. The word &ldquo;God&rdquo; is used in higher and lower senses,
and in his view the former always refer to the Father. The God of
Israel, the one true God, just is the Father of Jesus. Further, he is
the main and the primary and ultimate object of Christian worship and
prayer, and as the sole recipient of the highest kind of worship. In
his view, the Son of God has all the divine attributes but one, that
of existing <em>a se</em> that is, existing and not being in any sense
derivative of or dependent on anything else. To the contrary,
&ldquo;The <em>Father Alone</em> is Self-existent, Underived,
Unoriginated, Independent&rdquo; (Clarke, <em>Scripture</em>, 123). It is
contradictory to suppose that something has this property in any sense
because of another thing. In his view the Son and the Holy Spirit
(like the Son, a personal agent or self distinct from the Father)
exist and have their perfections because of the Father. Both are
functionally and ontologically subordinate to him, and in the Spirit
is at least functionally subordinate to the Son. What sort of
dependence relations are these? The Son and Spirit derive their being
from the Father as from a &ldquo;Supreme Cause&rdquo;, but we are not
to infer from this that the Father existed before them. The Bible
doesn&rsquo;t enlighten us on the nature of this dependence relationship,
but seems to presuppose that it always was (i.e., that infinitely back
in time, the Son and Spirit existed in dependence on the
Father). Thus, &ldquo;Arian&rdquo; subordinationists (see
 <a href="#FouCenAriSub">section 3.1</a>
 above)
are speculating groundlessly when they say there was a time when the
Son didn&rsquo;t exist. And if a &ldquo;creature&rdquo; must at some time begin to exist,
then neither Son nor Spirit are creatures. Still, Clarke thinks that we should
affirm with some of the early church fathers that this derivation of
the Son from the Father is &ldquo;not by <em>mere Necessity of</em> Nature,
(which would be in reality <em>Self-existence</em>, not
<em>Filiation</em>;) But by an <em>Act of the Father&rsquo;s
incomprehensible Power and Will</em>&rdquo; (141, original emphases).
Clarke argues that the New Testament teaches the eternal existence of
the Son, and that he is (co-) creator of the world. Further, it
teaches that the Holy Spirit is a personal agent distinct from God
(and not a power of God, or an exercise of such). And against the
mainstream tradition, &ldquo;The word <em>God</em>, in Scripture,
never signifies a complex Notion of <em>more Persons</em>
(or <em>Intelligent Agents</em>) <em>than One</em>; but always
means <em>One Person only, viz.</em>, either the Person of
the <em>Father</em> singly, or the Person of the <em>Son</em>
singly&rdquo; (155, original emphases). While the Spirit is nowhere
called &ldquo;God&rdquo; or held up for worship, Clarke holds that his
divinity is implied, and thus so is the appropriateness of his being
worshiped as the Son is worshiped. The early Fathers, he holds,
thought Father and Son to be
<em>homoousios</em> only in the sense that the latter is ineffably
derived from the former&mdash;not in the sense of their being the same
thing or the exact same kind of thing.</p>

<p>
Clarke attempts to recast the debate, taking a middle course between
Socinian unitarianism and more mainstream trinitarian views. This
middle view took voluminous fire from both sides. Clarke&rsquo;s most
formidable opponent was his learned and prolific friend, the reverend
Daniel Waterland (1683&ndash;1740), Regius Professor of Divinity at
Cambridge (Waterland 1856a-e). His main objections to Clarke may be
summed up as follows. Clarke&rsquo;s scheme differs in no important way from
Arianism. Clarke posits a greater and two lesser gods (both
creatures), and can&rsquo;t defend the practice of creature-worship. Clarke
misreads both the Bible and the early church fathers, both of which
teach that the Father, Son, and Spirit are God and are divine in the
same sense, and the latter of which teaches that the three
are <em>homoousios</em> in a sense which implies they are one and the
same being, although three persons. In short, Clarke is deluded in
thinking that there&rsquo;s any option other than the catholic doctrine,
Sabellianism, and Arianism. Waterland&rsquo;s own views are essentially
pro-Nicene and mysterian (Waterland 1856a, 453&ndash;63; 1856e,
405&ndash;6). (See the supplementary document on the history of
trinitarian doctrines
 <a href="trinity-history.html#ProNicCon">section 3.3</a>
 and main entry
 <a href="index-2.html#Mys">section 4</a>.) 
 This very long and intricate debate between Waterland and Clarke and
their respective allies, has been canvassed but never thoroughly
analyzed (Dixon 2003; Ferguson 1976; Pfizenmaier 1997, Wiles
1996).</p>

<p>
Another objection to Clarke&rsquo;s views was given in conversation to
Clarke not long before his premature death. He was asked: Is it
possible for the Father to annihilate the Son and Spirit? Presumably,
the dilemma is that if Clarke answers negatively, then the Son must be
God himself, who alone exists necessarily, or at least the Son must be
divine in an &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; sense. On the other hand, if he
answers affirmatively, then he compromises the divinity of the Son and
renders him a mere creature, as it will be possible for the Son to not
exist&mdash;his existence will not be inevitable. Clarke answered that
he hadn&rsquo;t thought of the question (Ferguson 1976, 146, 247&ndash;8;
Pfizenmaier 1997, 195&ndash;6; Van Mildert 1856, 78&ndash;9).</p>

<h4><a name="Lat19t21sCenJehWitSub">3.3 Late 19th&ndash;21st Century Jehovah&rsquo;s Witness Subordinationists</a></h4>

<p>
The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, since its inception in the
late 19th century, has taught that the Son is a creature, created
before the cosmos, and the agent through which God created the cosmos.
The Holy Spirit is simply the power of God, the Father. Thus, they
have been tagged as &ldquo;Arians&rdquo;, although they seem to have
developed their theology independently of any prior unitarian
literature. Like earlier unitarians, they make their stand on the
Bible, holding that it supports their view and is inconsistent with
creedal trinitarian views (Anonymous 1989; Holt 2002; Stafford 2007).
They make many points in common with earlier unitarians, but have
produced little scholarly literature.</p>

<h3><a name="18t21sCenUni">4. 18th&ndash;21st Century Unitarianism</a></h3>

<p>
A relatively strong subordinationist movement in England gradually
lost momentum after Clarke&rsquo;s death, and was supplanted by a more
radical unitarianism which nonetheless owed more to Clarke than to
earlier unitarian or Socinian sources. Having been convinced that the
Bible teaches the Father and the one God are one and the same, they
proceeded to discard the rest of Clarke&rsquo;s scheme in favor of one they
held was simpler and more in keeping with the teaching of the
apostles.</p>

<p>
In many cases, as with Newton&rsquo;s younger colleague Hopton Haynes
(ca. 1667&ndash;1749), the motivation seems to have been entirely
biblical (Haynes 1797). But another factor in the decline of Clarkean
subordinationism was the declining fortunes of
 <a href="../dualism/index.html">mind-body dualism.</a>
 Clarke held that Christ pre-existed in the form
of divine spirit, which spirit at the incarnation then indwelled the
body of Jesus, taking the place of a normal human soul (Cf.
 <a href="#FouCenAriSub">section 3.1</a> above.) Materialism about
human nature, then, implies that the subordinationists&rsquo; Jesus isn&rsquo;t a
human being. But it is a central tenet of Christianity that he was a
human being. Thus, many had a motive to adopt a materialist version of
what was later called a strictly &ldquo;humanitarian&rdquo;
christology&mdash;that Christ was a normal human and didn&rsquo;t
pre&ndash;exist his conception, but was instead a wholly material
being like any other human. Further, belief in a realm of spirits
other than God, i.e., in angels and demons, as well as human souls, was
on the decline (Belsham 1812, 209&ndash;14; Wiles 1996, 161&ndash;4).
Finally, Priestley and others held that former subordinationist and
prolific scholar Nathaniel Lardner (1684&ndash;1768) had made a
powerful scriptural case against Clarkean subordinationism.  (See
 <a href="#17t18tCenEngSub">section 3.2</a>
 above.) Lardner undercut a christology
favored by subordinationists, in which the eternal Word or Logos unites
with a human body in the man Jesus (as opposed to the mainstream view
that the Word united with both a human body and a human soul). Lardner
argues that the New Testament doesn&rsquo;t teach that either Jesus or an
element within him pre-existed Mary&rsquo;s pregnancy. The <em>logos</em>
(English: Word, Reason) of the first chapter of the Gospel of John is
best understood as a divine attribute, which metaphorically &ldquo;became
flesh&rdquo; in the man Jesus, and other traditional pre-existence proof
texts are interpreted in ways consistent with Christ not existing
before his conception. Lardner analyzes the use of &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; in the
Bible and concludes that it refers to God, or to various of God&rsquo;s
properties, actions, or gifts (Lardner 1793a-b).</p>

<p>
The driving forces of this new, English denominational Unitarian
movement were Joseph Priestley (1733&ndash;1804) and his friend
Theophilus Lindsey (1723&ndash;1808), the latter having publicly
resigned a post as an Anglican minister in protest of the doctrine of
the Trinity, and founded the first avowedly unitarian church in London
in 1774 (Lindsey 1818). These two, along with their fellow travelers,
poured out a large volume of plainly written, polemical but
cool-headed literature. They argued for what came to be called
&ldquo;humanitarian&rdquo; christology (Jesus had only a human
nature), and denounced worship of Christ as Christian idolatry, urging
true believers to leave trinitarian churches for the new Unitarian
ones. They were particularly concerned with the interpretation of
Bible texts which in their view had been commonly misread as
attributing pre-existence to Christ (or to his divine nature), and
literal divinity to Christ. Their antitrinitarianism was a part of a
larger program to thoroughly de-catholicize and de-calvinize
Christianity, and they gave a historical account of (as they saw it)
the gradual, near-total corruption of the religion of
Jesus (Priestley 1791a-c). This movement grew in England and Scotland
producing well-developed arguments against the deity of Christ, the
doctrine of two natures in Christ, and against trinitarian
interpretations of the Bible (Belsham 1817; Christie 1808, 1810;
Lindsey 1776). Many of its proponents, including Priestley and Lindsey,
revised other Christian doctrines as well, for example disavowing
belief in a personal Devil and demons, holding the accounts of the
birth of Christ to be later and unbelievable additions to those
gospels, or holding Christ to have been mistaken in some of his
interpretations of the Jewish scriptures.</p>

<p>
Influenced by these Unitarians, a somewhat different unitarian
movement arose in America. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries
there arose a &ldquo;liberal&rdquo;, anti-creedal, anti-Calvinist wing
of New England Congregationalism, which contained humanitarian and
(more commonly) subordinationist unitarians. After a series of public
controversies from 1805 to 1835, these liberal Congregationalists
accepted the label &ldquo;Unitarian&rdquo;, and left Congregationalism
to form their own denomination. Like the English Unitarians, many of
these American Unitarians argued at length that the Bible supports
unitarianism and humanitarian christology over trinitarianism (Lamson
1828; Norton 1859; Wilson 1846). Others argued for subordinationist
unitarian views (Worcester 1854).</p>

<p>

Still anti-creedal, anti-Calvinist, and dedicated to &ldquo;freedom of
conscience&rdquo;, American Unitarianism was transformed over the

course of the mid 19th century by internal movements
towards 
 <a href="../transcendentalism/index.html">Transcendentalism</a> and
universalism (see 
 <a href="../heaven-hell/index.html">heaven and hell</a>, section 1.2, and by an
increasing focus on various political causes. It evolved to the point
where even theism was considered optional for its
congregants (Grodzins 2009). While American Unitarians were long a
part of the &ldquo;Protestant establishment&rdquo;, by the early 20th
century American Unitarianism was widely written off by other
Christians as either a version of theological liberalism, or simply
not a version of Christianity at all, either way, irrelevant to their
concerns. Thus, in 1908 the Federal Council of Churches rejected a
Unitarian delegation on the grounds that they were not Christians, and
Unitarians have never been a part of the World Council of
Churches. This evolution from liberal Christian denomination to a
theism-optional religion has often been seen, both within and without
the movement, as a natural, perhaps inevitable development. Because of
this, most present day Christian theologians feel free to ignore the
entire history of unitarianism and its arguments.</p>

<p>
There are presently a number of small Christian groups calling
themselves &ldquo;biblical unitarians&rdquo; (or: Christian
monotheists or one God believers)to distinguish themselves from late
19th to 21st century Unitarians and Unitarian Universalists. Their
arguments draw on early modern unitarian sources, while eschewing some
of the idiosyncrasies of Socinus&rsquo;s theology and most of the extra
revisions of the Priestley-derived stream of unitarians. Like late
18th to early 19th century unitarians, they argue at length that
trinitarianism has no biblical foundation, and is inconsistent with
its clear teachings. They also reject trinitarianism as contradictory
or unintelligible, as involving idolatry, and as having been, as it
were, illegally imported from Platonic philosophy (Buzzard 2007;
Buzzard and Hunting 1999; Graeser et al. 2000; Snedeker 1998). On some
issues they draw support from recent biblical scholarship, for
example, the point that talk of &ldquo;generation&rdquo; and
&ldquo;procession&rdquo; in the gospel of John doesn&rsquo;t support later
claims about inter-trinitarian relations (Buzzard and Hunting 1999,
306&ndash;8). Although this literature points out real tensions within
contemporary theology (between text-oriented commentators and
systematic theologians) it is widely ignored in academic theology and
philosophy, and its adherents are generally excluded from the
institutions of mainstream Christianity.</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Evidence</a></h2>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-1" name="1">1.</a>
 On historical evidence, cf. Collingwood: &lsquo;Everything is
evidence which the historian can use as evidence. But what can he so
use? It must be something here and now perceptible to him: this
written page, this spoken utterance, this building, this finger-print
&hellip;&rsquo; (1956: 247).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-2" name="2">2.</a>
 See, among many similar declarations, Quine (1968: 75): &lsquo;The
stimulation of his sensory receptors is all the evidence anybody has
to go on, ultimately, in arriving at his picture of the
world&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-3" name="3">3.</a> On this, see Section 4
below.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-4" name="4">4.</a> Perhaps
&lsquo;evidence&rsquo; also has something of an empirical connotation
that &lsquo;reason to believe&rsquo; lacks: it sounds more natural, at
least to some ears, to describe <em>a priori</em> philosophical
considerations as <em>reasons to believe</em> some philosophical
thesis than as <em>evidence</em> for that thesis.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-5" name="5">5.</a> Consider what might seem
 to be among the best candidates for indefeasible evidence: a genuine
mathematical proof for the conclusion that <em>p</em> that one
correctly recognizes as such. Even in these circumstances, it is
arguable that one might acquire further evidence which would render
one unjustified in believing <em>p</em>: say, the testimony of expert
mathematicians to the effect that one's proof for <em>p</em> harbors
some subtle flaw which one lacks the sophistication to detect.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-6" name="6">6.</a> For some further
 discussion of the open questions, see Kelly (2008).  A classic
 discussion of the requirement of total evidence is Hempel (1960).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-7" name="7">7.</a> The point was forcefully
 pressed by Hilary Putnam in the 1960s as a reason for doubting that
Carnap's vision for inductive logic was a well-conceived research
program. The relevant papers are collected in Putnam (1975). Horwich
(1982) concedes the general epistemological point but argues that a
broadly Carnapian confirmation theory can successfully accommodate
it. Chihara (1987) argues that orthodox Bayesianism founders on the
same point. A good discussion of the general issue is Earman
(1992).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-8" name="8">8.</a> More particularly, the
 Bayesian will hold that responding to newly-acquired evidence in the
appropriate way involves <em>conditionalizing</em> on that
evidence. See Talbott (2001) for further discussion.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-9" name="9">9.</a> To a first approximation,
 <em>E</em> is <em>misleading evidence</em> for <em>p</em> just in
case (i) <em>E</em> is evidence for <em>p</em> and (ii) <em>p</em> is
false. Thus, misleading evidence is genuine evidence in that it
satisfies the conditions for being evidence (whatever those conditions
turn out to be). In this respect, it contrasts with <em>apparent</em>
evidence or <em>fake</em> evidence, which seem to satisfy the
conditions for being evidence but do not. The fact that misleading
evidence is genuine evidence is why beliefs based on misleading
evidence can be reasonable, given that what it is reasonable to
believe depends on one's evidence.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-10" name="10">10.</a>
 As is suggested by his use of this name, Williamson himself seems to
think that the sameness of evidence requirement entails that the
thinker's evidence is exhausted by the thinker's <em>experiences</em>.
That seems too strong, however. For one might hold that the thinker
has the same evidence in both cases, but that that evidence is not
limited to his experiences but also includes (e.g.) his non-object
dependent thoughts. Hence, my use of &lsquo;subjective, non-factive
mental states&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;experiences&rsquo; in the text
above. Williamson clearly is correct, however, in thinking that the
sameness of evidence requirement is incompatible with his own
preferred account of evidence, according to which one's evidence
consists of all and only those propositions that one knows.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-11" name="11">11.</a> Thus, Williamson's
 theory is an &lsquo;externalized&rsquo; theory of evidence, in the
sense of Silins (2005).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-12" name="12">12.</a> Silins (2005) contends
 that there are also circumstances in which the thinker in the good
case ends up being <em>less</em> reasonable than the thinker in the
bad case. He suggests, plausibly, that this is a potentially more
embarrassing consequence for such a theory: &lsquo;Even if one is
willing to accept the result that one is sometimes more rational in
the good case than in the bad case, it is harder to live with the
claim that one is sometimes more rational in the bad case than the
good case&rsquo; (p. 390).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-13" name="13">13.</a>
 Williamson himself would opt for (i): &lsquo;If perceptual evidence
in the case of illusions consists of true propositions, what are they?
The obvious answer is that things appear to be that way&rsquo; (2000:
198).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-14" name="14">14.</a>
 See, for example, Pollock and Cruz: &lsquo;We rarely have any beliefs
at all about how things appear to us. In perception, the beliefs we
form are almost invariably beliefs about the objective properties of
physical objects&mdash;not about how things appear to us&rsquo; (1999:
p. 61).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-15" name="15">15.</a>
 Anticipating such concerns, Williamson devotes some effort to
defending the idea that in typical cases of perception one does come
to know propositions about how things appear (2000:198-199).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-16" name="16">16.</a>
 A representative denial that either is possible is Ayer (1936),
according to which &lsquo;&hellip; no proposition is capable, even in
principle, of being verified conclusively, but only at best of being
rendered highly probable&rsquo; (p. 135). But see the preface to the
second edition (Ayer 1946) for some second thoughts on this point.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-17" name="17">17.</a>
 Compare Achinstein's (2001) concept of &lsquo;veridical
evidence&rsquo;: &lsquo;in this respect the present concept functions
like &ldquo;sign&rdquo; or &ldquo;symptom&rdquo;. A rash may be a sign
or symptom of a certain disease, or a good reason to believe the
disease is present, even if the medical experts are completely unaware
of the connection and so are not justified in believing that this
disease is present, given what they know&rsquo; (p. 25).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-18" name="18">18.</a>
 An example of the latter is Collingwood (1956): &lsquo;The whole
perceptible world, then, is potentially and in principle evidence to
the historian.  It becomes actual evidence in so far as he can use
it. And he cannot use it until he comes to it with the right kind of
historical knowledge. The more historical knowledge we have, the more
we can learn from any given piece of evidence; if we had none, we
could learn nothing. The enlargement of historical knowledge comes
about largely through finding how to use as evidence this or that kind
of perceived fact which historians have hitherto thought useless to
them&rsquo; (p. 247).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-19" name="19">19.</a> They also
 distinguished a third, &lsquo;comparative concept&rsquo; of
confirmation, which is employed in making judgements of the following
form: &lsquo;<em>H</em> is confirmed by <em>E</em> at least as highly
as <em>H</em>&prime; by <em>E</em>&prime;&rsquo;. The comparative
concept will not concern us here.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-20" name="20">20.</a>
 Especially notable among the puzzles was Hempel's (1945)
&lsquo;paradox of the ravens&rsquo; and Goodman's (1955) &lsquo;new
riddle of induction&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-21" name="21">21.</a>
 Carnap's original vision was breathtakingly ambitious; a fair bit of
the subsequent history of the subject has involved scaling back those
ambitions. Notably, Carnap's dream of an inductive logic that would
parallel deductive logic in having a purely formal character was
ultimately abandoned as unworkable; the conclusion that confirmation is
not a purely formal matter is often taken to be one of the lessons of
Goodman (1955).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-22" name="22">22.</a>
 In addition to the works by Bayesians noted above, Earman (1992) is a
sophisticated, sympathetic yet critical survey by a self-described
&lsquo;lapsed Bayesian&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-23" name="23">23.</a>
 For the reasons noted above, Bayesians will typically hold that,
strictly speaking, the proper formulation is &lsquo;<em>E</em> is
evidence for <em>H</em> relative to background theory
<em>T</em>&rsquo;. For expository purposes, I will treat this
relativization to background theory as understood in what follows.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-24" name="24">24.</a>
 Consider, for example, Federal Rule of Evidence 401, which defines
&lsquo;relevant evidence&rsquo; as that &lsquo;having any tendency to
make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the
determination of the action more probable or less probable than it
would be without the evidence&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-25" name="25">25.</a> Kronz (1992) and Maher
 (1996) are replies to Achinstein. Achinstein continues the debate in
his (1992) and (2001, ch.4).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-26" name="26">26.</a>
 Indeed, the logical positivists tended to simply identify
&lsquo;objective&rsquo; questions with those that are susceptible to
intersubjective resolution (see, e.g., Feigl 1953: 11).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-27" name="27">27.</a>
 Hempel suggests that the appeal of the &lsquo;narrow inductivist
account&rsquo; lies in the belief that if theories were formulated
prior to the collection of data which bears on their truth, then this
would introduce a potentially biasing factor which would jeopardize
the scientific objectivity of the investigation (p. 11). He argues,
however, that scientific objectivity is underwritten not by the
priority of evidence to theory within the context of discovery but
rather by the priority of evidence to theory within the context of
justification (p. 16). On this point, see below.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-28" name="28">28.</a> See especially the
 essays collected in his (1975).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-29" name="29">29.</a>
 Even when understood in this way, however, the idea that evidence is
prior to theory can easily be pushed too far. Thus, as Quine (1951)
emphasized, one might be justified in rejecting an apparent
observation that <em>p</em> (say, that what one just saw was a
centaur) if it conflicts too sharply with one's background theories,
even if one would be justified in taking the same apparent observation
at face value in the absence of those theories.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-30" name="30">30.</a>
 I believe that historical case studies played a significant role in
driving this tendency. In particular, Kuhn's (1962)
historically-informed insistence that many of the greatest heroes of
scientific inquiry had disagreed with one another in ways that did not
seem to admit of rational adjudication, coupled with a certain
reluctance to declare one or the other side (or both) unreasonable, led
naturally to the embrace of increasingly liberal standards of
rationality. Another factor, perhaps equally or more important in some
quarters, was the failure to arrive at a consistent version of some
(suitably-restricted) Principle of Indifference for assigning prior
probabilities to hypotheses and the consequent waning of enthusiasm for
this project. This contributed to the rise of subjectivism among those
attempting to explicate the concept of confirmation in probabilistic
terms, as reflected in the present status of subjective Bayesianism as
&lsquo;orthodox&rsquo; Bayesianism.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-31" name="31">31.</a> A good discussion is
 Earman (1992, see especially Chapter 6).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-32" name="32">32.</a> The <em>loci classici </em>for
 the doctrine of theory-ladenness are Hanson (1961) and Kuhn (1962). A
contemporary defender is Paul Churchland, see his (1979) and
(1988).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-33" name="33">33.</a>
 Interestingly, Carnap himself was prepared to admit that this
represented something of a departure from actual scientific practice:</p>

<blockquote> To a philosopher, &lsquo;observable&rsquo; has a very
narrow meaning. It applies to such properties as &lsquo;blue&rsquo;,
&lsquo;hard&rsquo;, &lsquo;hot&rsquo; &hellip; To the physicist, the
word has a much broader meaning.&hellip; In general, the physicist
speaks of observables in a very wide sense compared to the narrow
sense of the philosopher (1966: 225-226).
 </blockquote>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-34" name="34">34.</a> See, for example, the
 exchange between Fodor (1984), (1988) and Churchland (1988).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-35" name="35">35.</a>
 Cf. Fodor: &lsquo;Nevertheless, it is perfectly obviously true that
scientific observations often turn up unexpected and unwelcome facts,
that experiments often fail and are often seen to do so, in short that
what scientists observe isn't determined solely, or even largely, by
the theories that they endorse, still less by the hopes that they
cherish&rsquo; (1984: 251). </p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-36" name="36">36.</a> On this aspect of
 Boyle's thought, see especially Shapin (1994).</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-37" name="37">37.</a> &lsquo;Under the influence
 of some philosophers, especially Mach and Russell, I regarded in the
<em>Logischer Aufba</em> a phenomenalistic language as the best for a
philosophical analysis of knowledge. I believed that the task of
philosophy consists in reducing all knowledge to a basis of
certainty. Since the most certain knowledge is that of the immediately
given, whereas knowledge of material things is derivative and less
certain, it seemed that the philosopher must employ a language which
uses sense-data as a basis. In the Vienna discussions my attitude
changed gradually toward a preference for the physicalistic language
&hellip; In our discussions, Neurath in particular urged the
development toward a physicalistic attitude &hellip; In my view, one
of the most important advantages of the physicalistic language is its
intersubjectivity, i.e., the fact that the events described in this
language are in principle observable by all users of the
language&rsquo; (1963: 50-52). For the influence of Popper on the same
point, see p. 32.</p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-38" name="38">38.</a>
 On the interpretation sketched here, the view of evidence that was
ultimately embraced by the logical positivists is the exact contrary
of the view that had been embraced by (many) traditional
epistemologists: according to the former, evidence is essentially
public while according to the latter evidence is essentially
private. On an alternative interpretation of the later positivist
view, it is not evidence itself which is essentially public, but
rather &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; evidence, i.e., evidence that it would
be appropriate to use in the justification of scientific claims. This
would seem to leave open the possibility that, in addition to
scientific evidence, there is also non-scientific evidence, which need
not have a public character. However, this second interpretation fails
to give due weight to the logical positivist view about the
relationship between the empirical sciences and possible objects of
knowledge. A central tenet of positivism was the view that anything
which is a possible object of human knowledge can be known <em>via</em> the
methods of the empirical sciences (with the singular exceptions of the
<em>a priori</em> and allegedly purely formal disciplines of logic and
mathematics). Thus, there was no room within the positivist world view
for a category of &lsquo;non-scientific&rsquo; evidence: any
constraints on the notion of scientific evidence are constraints on
the notion of evidence itself. (In this respect, contrast the above
passage from Railton, which seems to explicitly allow for the
existence of &lsquo;introspective or subjectively privileged&rsquo;
evidence, in addition to the kind of evidence which is alleged to
underwrite scientific objectivity.) </p>

<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#note-39" name="39">39. </a>&lsquo;It is not true in
 general that statements of how things are are &ldquo;based on&rdquo;
statements of how things appear, look, or seem and not vice
versa.&hellip; I may say, for instance, &ldquo;The pillar is

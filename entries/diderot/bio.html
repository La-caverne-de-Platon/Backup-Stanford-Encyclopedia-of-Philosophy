<h2>Biography of Diderot</h2>

<p>
The arc of Diderot&rsquo;s long, varied, and eventful life can be
summarized by reducing it to four distinct phases: </p>

<ol type="1">

<li> a period of maturation amidst struggle in the 1730s and 40s as
the impoverished young Diderot sought to establish himself as a
self-sustaining adult in Old Regime Paris through the pursuit of the
highly precarious vocation of writing and publishing; </li>

<li> a period of intellectual ascent after 1749 as Diderot used the
new financial stability and intellectual notoriety acquired through
his supervision of the epochal <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> project to
build a base for his mature career as an Enlightenment writer, critic,
and <em>philosophe;</em> </li>

<li>a period of intellectual celebrity as the new freedom brought
about by the final completion of the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>
project in 1765 allowed Diderot to produce some of his most important,
if often unpublished, work; </li>

<li> a twilight period begun in 1773 after his financial burdens were
fully eliminated through the lucrative patronage offered by Empress
Catherine the Great of Russia, a period when Diderot brought to
completion the wider philosophical program established earlier, while
adding a new strand of political radicalism to the mix.</li>

<h3 id="YearFormStru1713">1. Years of Formation and Struggle (1713&ndash;1749)</h3>

<p>
Born in 1713 in Langres, a middling cathedral town in central France
about 300 kilometers southeast of Paris, Diderot began life with very
little pointing him toward his future as a world renowned writer and
intellectual. His father was an artisan cutler who hoped his son would
rise above him into a career in the liberal professions, and since
Langres possessed a Jesuit college, Diderot&rsquo;s father enrolled
him there in an effort to give him the education necessary for social
uplift. His ambitions were rewarded when Denis graduated with prizes
in rhetoric and mathematics, an event that Diderot once described as
his father&rsquo;s proudest moment.</p>

<p>
While still under the tutelage of the Jesuits, Diderot contemplated an
ecclesiastical career, a common method of Old Regime social uplift
that would have provided him with a regular, salaried life in the
manner dreamed for him by his father. He went far enough to be
tonsured in 1726, but stopped short of full ordination, and after his
academic success, Diderot&rsquo;s family supported his move to Paris
around 1729 in order to continue his studies and find a professional
calling. This led to more education, including the equivalent of a
bachelor&rsquo;s degree awarded in 1732 by the Coll&egrave;ge
d&rsquo;Harcourt in Paris, and three more years studying natural
philosophy and theology at the Sorbonne. Law was another professional
option available to him, but after an unhappy apprenticeship with an
attorney, Diderot left this behind as well. Little documentation
exists regarding this period in Diderot&rsquo;s life, but what is
clear is that he found in Paris a thriving center of ideas and urban
sociability, and out of his immersion in this world as a student, his
career began to move on a different track.</p>

<h4 id="EarlCareWrit">1.1 Earliest Career as a Writer</h4>

<p>
He made his way during these years through work as a piece writer in
the vibrant but economically constrained world of Parisian publishing.
D&rsquo;Alembert would later romanticize the life of the poor but
fully independent writer as an ideal to which all <em>honn&ecirc;tes
gens de lettres</em> should aspire. But as the illegitimate son of a
wealthy aristocrat who provided for him financially, D&rsquo;Alembert
never actually lived the impoverished bohemian writer&rsquo;s life in
the flesh. Diderot did, and during these early years he struggled
continuously to eke out a minimal existence through occasional work
with his pen. Money came from journalists who paid him by the word to
provide content for their weekly and monthly periodicals. In this way,
Diderot penned many of the anonymous book reviews that were a staple
of these journals even if there is no way to document Diderot&rsquo;s
output today.</p>

<p>
Since he was also good with languages, especially English, a talent
whose source in Diderot&rsquo;s biography is unclear (some say he
taught himself using a Latin-English dictionary), he also found work
as a translator. His first publishing success came in 1744 with his
translation of Temple Stanyan&rsquo;s staid <em>Grecian History</em>,
a work that earned him his first published notice in the <em>Journal
des Savants</em> as the book&rsquo;s &ldquo;rather negligent&rdquo;
translator. It also earned him a meager payment of three hundred
francs. He also showed his interest in and expertise with the
Enlightenment natural sciences through his translation of Robert
James&rsquo; dictionary of medical terms. More translation work
followed, and while the jobs helped him to increase his public
notoriety, they did not make him any more financially secure. His
financial hardship was intensified in 1743 when he chose to marry the
equally poor Antoinette Champion. The couple gave birth to a daughter
soon after their wedding, and while Diderot remained devoted to his
wife and child throughout his life, his marriage led his family in
Langres to renounce him completely, further increasing his
hardship.</p>

<h4 id="InteBreaPublDebu1740">1.2 Intellectual Breakthrough and Public Debut in the 1740s</h4>

<p>
In the 1740s, amid his continuing poverty and social marginalization,
Diderot began to build the career as a writer and intellectual that
would make him famous. In 1742, he met the young Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, a key moment in the genesis of the <em>philosophe</em>
movement that Rousseau immortalized for posterity in his
<em>Confessions</em>. Etienne Bonnot de Condillac likewise joined
their circle at this time, and together these three would-be
<em>philosophes</em> shared a bohemian writer&rsquo;s life looking for
public acclaim and patronage (the two often went together) in the
bustling circles of lettered Parisian society. In this setting, and
without any clear financial return in mind as he made the effort,
Diderot also began to write and publish his own books. Through them,
and sociable circulation within the urbane society of Paris, he began
to establish his name and reputation as a philosophical author, one
who from the start, and ever after, was associated with the most
radical and controversial ideas.</p>

<p>
The diversity of Diderot&rsquo;s textual output in the 1740s
exemplifies the crooked path of his ascent. It also illustrates the
eclectic and sharp edged character of Enlightenment
<em>philosophie</em>. His first published work, which appeared in
1745, continued in a way his work as a translator since it was not a
wholly original text, but a very loose translation of Anthony Ashley
Cooper, the Earl of Shaftesbury&rsquo;s <em>An Inquiry Concerning
Virtue and Merit</em>. Diderot&rsquo;s text included a set of
reflections in a prologue, and lengthy footnotes providing further
reflection on Shaftesbury&rsquo;s ideas, which Diderot shared. These
included Shaftesbury&rsquo;s naturalist and loosely materialist and
deist leanings. The Jesuit-edited <em>Journal de Tr&eacute;voux</em>
captured the spirit of the book rightly, if not affectionately, when
it called it a &ldquo;discourse on morality as if written by Mr.
Locke&rdquo;. The Locke referenced here was the author of the
<em>Essay Concerning Human Understanding</em>, a work which to many
French readers in 1745 amounted to a treatise on materialist
metaphysics. This treatise showed how human consciousness could be
viewed as a phenomenon derived from matter and motion alone, or so
those worried about such ideas claimed. This materialist Locke, who
allegedly wondered whether matter could think, circulated in
eighteenth-century France as one of many specters constituting the
wider philosophical danger interchangeably called deism, atheism,
materialism, and Spinozism. From the beginning, and throughout his
life, Diderot willingly cavorted with those who danced with these
philosophical spectres.</p>

<p>
His second book, published in 1746, which was also his first with no
connection to translation, implicated him at the heart of this very
coven. Called <em>Pens&eacute;es philosophiques</em>, it offered, as
its title suggested, a series of provocative philosophical
propositions that suggested theses and arguments related to questions
of matter, motion, nature, science, and philosophy. No single argument
unified the book, and while its contents were certainly natural
philosophical, it is difficult to find a single theory or hypothesis
that ties everything in it together. Instead, it is a book of
provocative statements and theses to argue with. As such, it
inaugurated an important feature of Diderot&rsquo;s overall
philosophy: its dialogic and intersubjective character.</p>

<p>
Diderot&rsquo;s first two books announced the eclectic approach to
<em>philosophie</em> that would be his hallmark, and having launched
this pattern his next works only added further diversity to his
emerging <em>oeuvre</em>. <em>La Promenade du sceptique</em>, which
was written at this time but only published a century later, defies
any precise genre classification. A sort of philosophical dialogue,
but one that also draws from the emerging sensibilities of the
Enlightenment epistolary novel, the text takes its readers on a kind
of intellectual journey where the worlds of the various philosophical
sects are visited&mdash;travel narratives, including those to
extraterrestrial worlds, were another intertextual referent used by
Diderot. The reader of <em>La Promenade du sceptique</em> encounters
Pyrrhonians, Spinozists, deists, idealists (i.e. Berkeley), and more,
yet no voice of overarching unification or synthesizing argument is
present. Diderot&rsquo;s next book, published in 1748, was radically
different in genre, if no different in its interrogative philosophical
intent. Called <em>Les Bijoux indiscrets</em>, it is best described as
a work of philosophical pornography since the story involves a
Sultan&rsquo;s magical ring that provokes female genitalia to speak of
their experiences. This results in a text that intersperses bawdy
sexual stories with discourses on such philosophical topics as the
relationship between &ldquo;Experience&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Hypothesis&rdquo; and the merits of &ldquo;Newtonian&rdquo; as
opposed to &ldquo;Cartesian&rdquo; natural philosophy. <em>Les Bijoux
indiscrets</em> brought an exceptionally large and welcome financial
return to Diderot, and it remains his most published book.</p>

<h4 id="LettSurLesAveuLusaDeCeuxQuiVoie">1.3 <em>Lettre sur les aveugles &agrave; l&rsquo;usage de ceux qui voient</em></h4>

<p>
The climax of this decade of prolific literary output occurred in 1749
with the publication of <em>Lettre sur les aveugles &agrave;
l&rsquo;usage de ceux qui voient</em>, one of Diderot&rsquo;s
masterpieces and arguably his most sophisticated and complex
philosophical text after <em>Le R&ecirc;ve de D&rsquo;Alembert</em>
and <em>Le Neveu de Rameau</em>. Classifying this work into any single
genre is even less easy to do than with the others Diderot wrote in
the 1740s. Perhaps the best short description of the book is the one
offered by Diderot biographer Arthur N. Wilson, who simply called it
&ldquo;disarming&rdquo; (1972: 97). Taking flight as a series of
reflections on the blind English mathematician Nicholas Saunderson,
the <em>Lettre sur les aveugles</em> is written, says Wilson,
&ldquo;with the easy artfulness of someone idly improvising on a
musical instrument&rdquo;. Yet as it gets going, the breeziness of the
text subtly becomes more ponderous. &ldquo;One subject suggests
another&rdquo;, Wilson writes, and soon the reader is &ldquo;led on
and on through a sort of steeplechase over the various metaphysical
jumps until finally he gets himself soaked in the waterhole called
&lsquo;Does God Exist?&rsquo;&rdquo; (1972: 97).</p>

<h4 id="SuccScanImpr1749">1.4 Success, Scandal, and Imprisonment in 1749</h4>

<p>
Diderot&rsquo;s public acclaim as a brilliant writer and philosophical
<em>esprit fort</em> increased in step with the advancing acclaim of
these books, and by the time that the <em>Lettre</em> had appeared he
had become famous enough for Voltaire himself, already the public face
of radical <em>philosophie</em> because of his vigorous campaigns on
behalf of Newtonianism, to write to Diderot praising his books and
inviting him to join him for a &ldquo;philosophical supper&rdquo;. The
connection with Voltaire would prove fundamental for Diderot in the
years to come, but if his arrival as a new philosophical star in
Voltaire&rsquo;s orbit illustrates his rapid ascent after 1745, it
also explains the new interest that Diderot was attracting within the
French police.</p>

<p>
Diderot published all of his initial books anonymously, bypassing in
this way the censorship regime that regulated the book trade in
absolutist France. Anonymous publication by itself was not illicit,
but given the content of his books and his evasion of the royal
censors that secured a book&rsquo;s legality, Diderot&rsquo;s
publications in the 1740s constituted a double provocation. A police
file with Diderot&rsquo;s name on it was opened soon after the
<em>Pens&eacute;es philosophiques</em> appeared, and the Parisian
<em>Parlement</em>, the judicial organ of the French state, expressed
its support for the new scrutiny of this author when it ordered the
<em>Pens&eacute;es</em> publicly burned in July 1746. As his next
books appeared, Diderot became the target of vigorous police
surveillance, and by 1749 the evidence pointing to Diderot&rsquo;s
authorship of these subversive works was conclusive. The publication
of <em>Lettre sur les aveugles</em> sealed the case, and soon after
its appearance a <em>lettre de cachet</em> was issued ordering
Diderot&rsquo;s incarceration in the royal prison at Vincennes. The
letter was executed in July 1749, and Diderot spent three months in
jail before his release the following November.</p>

<h3 id="AsceWritPhilThroEncy">2. Ascendance as Writer and <em>Philosophe</em> through the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> (1750&ndash;1765)</h3>

<p>
The coincidence of the arrival of Voltaire&rsquo;s first letter to
Diderot inviting him to join him in philosophical camaraderie and
Diderot&rsquo;s imprisonment at Vincennes can serve as the transition
point marking the second phase of Diderot&rsquo;s life. The arrival of
Voltaire in Diderot&rsquo;s life brought two immediate changes that
would mark his years of maturity. First, their union constitutes a key
moment in the genesis of the <em>philosophe</em> party, an association
that would ever after mark Diderot as a subversive thinker at odds
with the intellectual establishment. Second, and rather ironically,
his association with Voltaire also provided him with a new kind of
security since it brought him into the fold of the political
authorities sympathetic to controversial thinkers and writers like the
<em>philosophes.</em></p>

<p>
Voltaire had established the persona of the radical
<em>philosophe</em> as outlaw after 1734 when he escaped his own
<em>lettre de cachet</em> by fleeing to the sovereign chateau of an
established aristocrat at Cirey in the Champagne east of Paris.
Voltaire&rsquo;s protector in this case was the wife of the said
sovereign aristocrat, Emilie le Tonnier de Breteuil, the Marquise du
Ch&acirc;telet, who happened also to be Voltaire&rsquo;s intellectual
partner and a serious scientific intellectual in her own right. Emilie
du Ch&acirc;telet was pregnant when Voltaire wrote to Diderot in June
1749, and she died in September during childbirth while Diderot was
serving his sentence at Vincennes. Yet her influence survived her
death since, by coincidence, a member of the du Ch&acirc;telet family
was then serving as warden of the Vincennes prison. Thanks to his
influence, and that of other royal officials sympathetic to Voltaire,
Diderot&rsquo;s time in prison was made much less onerous than it
might have been.</p>

<h4 id="EncyProj">2.1 The <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> Project</h4>

<p>
When Diderot was released from prison in November 1749, he was already
at work on a new project, the one that would fully launch him to
global intellectual fame. The origins of this project went back to the
very beginning of Diderot&rsquo;s life as an author, and especially to
his initial work as a translator. In 1745, a Parisian publisher named
Andr&eacute;-Fran&ccedil;ois Le Breton secured an official
<em>privil&egrave;ge</em> to publish a complete French translation of
Ephraim Chambers&rsquo; 1728 <em>Cyclopedia, or Universal Dictionary
of Arts and Sciences.</em> In June 1746, Breton gave editorial control
of the project to a rather undistinguished member of the
Acad&eacute;mie Royale des Sciences, the abb&eacute; de Gua de Malves,
who in turn appointed two assistants: his academic colleague
D&rsquo;Alembert and Diderot. A week after receiving his appointment,
Diderot&rsquo;s <em>Pens&eacute;es philosophiques</em> was publicly
burned by the <em>Parlement de Paris</em>, yet undeterred Diderot
began at the same moment to assert his influence over the shape of the
encyclopedia project. In October 1747, De Gua de Malves stepped down,
ceding complete control of the project to D&rsquo;Alembert and
Diderot. In June 1748, a new <em>privil&egrave;ge</em> for the book
was obtained as a result of a change in its conception. Now titled
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die, ou Dictionnaire Universel des sciences, des
arts, et des m&eacute;tiers</em> the work was beginning to lose its
character as a translation and starting to become a new and original
publication. Diderot pushed the book even further in this innovative
direction, and when he took up residence in his cell at Vincennes, the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> project was very much on his mind. Among
his visitors while in prison, in fact, were D&rsquo;Alembert and Le
Breton, who expressed worries about the impact of Diderot&rsquo;s
imprisonment on the book&rsquo;s sales.</p>

<p>
Within a year after Diderot&rsquo;s release, in November 1750, Le
Breton released eight thousand copies of a &ldquo;Prospectus&rdquo;
for the work, a text authored by Diderot, which invited readers to buy
advanced subscriptions for a radically new kind of compendium. The
&ldquo;Prospectus&rdquo; promised that the first volume of the new
work would appear within six months. In the <em>Prospectus</em>,
Diderot began to reveal his conception of what the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> would become. No longer a translation of
someone else&rsquo;s book, and even less a staid compendium of already
established learning, the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> was always
imagined by Diderot as a dynamic site of living thought, an engine for
changing, not codifying, existing knowledge. Diderot would more fully
develop the ideas first articulated in the &ldquo;Prospectus&rdquo; in
his article &ldquo;Encyclop&eacute;die&rdquo;, which was published in
volume V of the work in November 1755.</p>

<h4 id="ScanEncy">2.2 The Scandal of the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em></h4>

<p>
1750 saw the full launch of the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> project,
along with all of the intellectual transformations that would follow
in its train, including the controversies that would forever shape its
legacy and that of its editors. Diderot&rsquo;s scandals of the
previous year were certainly in readers&rsquo; minds as they read his
announcement of the new encyclopedia project, and other events were
also in the air making 1750 a moment ripe with transformative
potential. A series of controversial philosophical books had just
appeared, including Condillac&rsquo;s 1746 <em>Essai sur
l&rsquo;origine des connaissances humaines</em>, Montesquieu&rsquo;s
1748 <em>De L&rsquo;Esprit des Lois</em>, and the first volume of
Buffon&rsquo;s <em>l&rsquo;Histoire naturelle</em>, which appeared in
1749. Looking back, many have seen 1750 as the year when the French
Enlightenment battle between orthodox and heterodox thought, and
especially between skepticism and faith, truly began. Appearing at
exactly this moment, and poking at precisely these fault-lines, the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>, and especially Diderot&rsquo;s work
within it, has been viewed by many as the match that ignited these
cultural fires. Diderot also played a singularly important role in
directing these fires into the historically transformative
conflagration of the French Enlightenment.</p>

<p>
Whatever its prior preparation, the launch of the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> in November 1750 provoked a war between
its editors and the religious authorities in France. At the heart of
the struggle were the French members of the Society of Jesus. In 1701,
the order&rsquo;s professors at its leading Parisian college began to
edit a learned periodical in the provincial city of Tr&eacute;voux. By
1750 this Jesuit <em>Journal de Tr&eacute;voux</em> had become a
well-respected organ of learned commentary, one with a particular
reputation for aggressive critique on matters of religion and faith.
When the &ldquo;Prospectus&rdquo; for the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>
appeared, its lead editor Father Guillaume-Fran&ccedil;ois Berthier,
S.J. continued this tradition by taking up his pen to rail against the
new encyclopedia project and its editors. Diderot replied in kind in
his <em>Lettre au R. P. Berthier</em>, a pamphlet that deployed the
witty, satirical tone that had characterized his books of the 1740. He
also defended directly the intellectual programs that he had announced
in his &ldquo;Prospectus&rdquo;. Accordingly, as the first volumes
began to appear they entered an intellectual field already polarized
by arguments between public clerics and <em>philosophes.</em></p>

<p>
The rancor intensified when Volume I, containing all of the entries
starting with the letter &ldquo;A&rdquo;, appeared. Berthier found in
this first volume, along with many other provocations, the
multi-authored article &ldquo;Ame&rdquo; (Soul), which Diderot
contributed to significantly. It deployed a full materialist arsenal
to lay out the contemporary understanding of this term and its
relationship (usually opposed) to traditional Thomist and Christian
philosophy, along with its affinities with ancient pagan
understandings. While the article on the soul was a masterpiece of
serious philosophical reasoning and argument, Berthier also
encountered Diderot&rsquo;s characteristically witty and sarcastic
brand of <em>philosophie</em> in other articles in the inaugural
volume as well, and overall he found many reasons to worry about
Diderot&rsquo;s orthodoxy and his commitment to upholding traditional
canons of thought and morality. </p>

<p>
No better illustration exists than the entry in Volume I for
&ldquo;Anthropophagie&rdquo; (Cannibalism). In the
&ldquo;Prospectus&rdquo;, Diderot had discussed the organization of
knowledge appropriate for a new encyclopedia, and among the themes he
stressed was his dynamic understanding of the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> as a living work that must incorporate
the ever changing character of knowledge in its organization. As
Diderot explained, the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> would never really
be finished. As soon as one article was completed, it would need to be
updated, and new articles not already included would need to be added
all in an effort to contain all of the new currents of thought coming
into being at every moment. With respect to the articles that were
included, their relation to one another was often as important as the
discrete entry itself, he explained, since the real meaning of any
term was often best found in the connection between it and various
other words rather than in the single definition itself. Diderot
therefore adapted from Chambers&rsquo;s work an explicit
cross-referencing system that used &ldquo;<em>renvois</em>&rdquo;
added at the end of entries to point readers to other articles that
connected with or elaborated upon the material found in each
definition. The <em>renvois</em> system was not original to the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>, nor was the practice of
cross-referencing in and of itself controversial, yet Berthier found
much to complain about in Diderot&rsquo;s general tendency to use
these and other aspects of the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> to indulge
in what he found to be dangerous evasions and sometimes outright
subversions of the true foundations of knowledge. The article
&ldquo;Anthropophagie&rdquo; illustrates well the sort of thing that
provoked these worries. After a fairly prosaic summary of the practice
of cannibalism as it was described in travelers&rsquo; accounts of the
known <em>anthropophages</em> extant in the Americas, the article,
which was not authored by Diderot and was imported largely intact from
Chambers&rsquo;s work, ended with a <em>renvoi</em> that pointed
readers to another article where further understanding regarding the
human eating of other men could be found. The article suggested was
&ldquo;Eucharistie&rdquo;. Berthier did not specifically note this
article in his attacks upon Diderot and his encyclopedic agenda, but
it was the presence of these and other moments of willful impropriety
that defined for the Jesuit the real agendas of the project.</p>

<h4 id="PradAffa">2.3 The Prades Affair</h4>

<p>
More gasoline was thrown on these erupting controversies a month after
Volume I of the compendium appeared when a friend of Diderot&rsquo;s,
and a contributor to the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>&mdash;he wrote
the entry for &ldquo;Theological Certitude&rdquo;&mdash;successfully
defended his doctoral thesis in philosophy at the Sorbonne. No
questions were raised by the Parisian Doctors of Theology who examined
the thesis submitted by the abb&eacute; Jean-Martin Prades entitled
<em>To the celestial Jerusalem: Upon what face is it that God has
disseminated the breath of life?</em> (<em>Jerusalem in coelesti: quis
est ille in facem Deus inspiravit spiraculus vitae?</em>). However,
after rumors began to circulate&mdash;Diderot was likely behind many
of them&mdash;suggesting that Prades&rsquo;s thesis contained overtly
pagan and materialist arguments, the Jesuits began to investigate.</p>

<p>
In January 1751, after learning that Prades did in fact defend
questionable positions, such as that the soul is an unknown substance,
sensations are the source of our ideas, and revealed religion is only
natural religion in its evolution, the Sorbonne renounced its support
for the thesis and revoked Prades&rsquo; degree. The Archbishop of
Paris also issued a decree, days after the appearance of Volume II of
the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>, condemning the thesis, and the
<em>Parlement de Paris</em> supported the judgment by ordering the
text of the thesis to be publicly burned. A month later, the Jesuit
Father Jean-Baptiste Geoffroy, a colleague of Berthier, also published
a pamphlet fully exposing the connections between Prades, Diderot, and
the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> project.</p>

<p>
On February 7, the crown intervened in what was becoming a very heated
public scandal by suspending the publication <em>privil&egrave;ge</em>
for the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>.Thanks to the favor that Diderot
and his partners now enjoyed among those in the upper echelons of the
French government, however, the suspension only lasted until the heat
of the controversy had subsided. Volume III appeared in early 1753,
accompanied by a new advertisement written by d&rsquo;Alembert
reassuring readers about the continuing vitality of the project
(subscribers in particular were promised a full return on their
payments). Thanks to this settlement, Volumes IV&ndash;VI appeared
between 1754&ndash;1756, and while these were accompanied by ongoing
criticism of encyclopedia project by the Jesuits in the <em>Journal de
Tr&eacute;voux</em>, no further threats to the existence of the
project appeared.</p>

<h4 id="SuspEncyCompExil">2.4 The Suspension of the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> and its Completion in Exile</h4>

<p>
The controversies over the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> were not over,
however, and Diderot&rsquo;s most difficult years with the project
were still to come. The event that triggered the return of unrest had
little overtly to do with <em>philosophie</em> unless one believed the
stories linking the two that clerics and other members of the
<em>parti d&eacute;vot</em> began to promulgate after the events
themselves took place. The drama occurred on 5 January 1757, as King
Louis XV walked from the Royal Palace of Versailles to his awaiting
carriage. Out of the assembled crowd an obscure house servant named
Robert-Fran&ccedil;ois Damiens rushed past the royal bodyguards and
stabbed the king with a small penknife. The wound was anything but
life threatening, but the attempted lethal attack on the sacred body
of the sovereign was nevertheless an egregious transgression, one
punishable by the most extreme measures.</p>

<p>
The subsequent execution of Damiens has since become legendary because
of its use for the last time in French history of the traditional
method of drawing and quartering the assassin&rsquo;s body by
harnessed horses, an event that has become famous through the grisly
description of it offered by Michel Foucault in the opening of his
widely read <em>Surveiller et punir</em>. In the context of the
discussion here, however, the significance of the attempted regicide
is more to be found in the perceived motivations said to have led
Damiens to his action. The police interrogation reveals a highly
emotional man moved passionately by the contemporary clerical
divisions that were pitting Jansenists, Jesuits, and the French
episcopacy against one another in battles over proper Church
orthodoxy. Yet in a distillation that would prove influential in
shaping the fate of Diderot, and the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>project overall, many high officials began
to link Damiens&rsquo;s purported madness to the unchecked spread of
dangerous and subversive <em>philosophie</em> in France.</p>

<p>
The new climate of opinion was institutionalized four months after the
attempted royal assassination when the <em>Parlement de Paris</em>
issued a new edict prescribing either the death penalty or service in
the galleys for any author or publisher convicted of publishing
tendentious or clandestine works. New critics of the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> also appeared, writers who joined with
the Jesuits in condemning the subversive effects of the compendium and
its agendas. Especially virulent was the journalist Elie Fr&eacute;ron
who used his journal <em>Ann&eacute;e Litt&eacute;raire</em> to launch
a sustained and persistent attack on the project and its editors after
1757. Works with a similar, if less vitriolic, slant also appeared as
pamphlets or as articles published in periodicals, such as the future
Royal Historiographer Moreau&rsquo;s assessment, published in June
1757 in the <em>Mercure de France.</em> This piece spoke of an
&ldquo;Encyclopedist party&rdquo; organized for the purpose of
attacking morality, religion and government. When Volume VII of the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> appeared in November 1757, not quite a
year after Damiens&rsquo;s attack, the tinder was therefore set for a
new eruption of controversy. This time D&rsquo;Alembert found himself
at the center of the cross-hairs for his article &ldquo;Geneva&rdquo;,
which outraged Genevan pastors because of his overly sympathetic
treatment of Socinianism and of natural religion in general, and
angered the pious through its defense of the public value of theater.
The controversy led D&rsquo;Alembert to resign as editor in January
1758, and although he returned a few months later, he resigned
permanently the following year, putting Diderot in sole control of the
project and its public relations.</p>

<p>
The final blow against the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> occurred in
July 1758 when Claude-Adrien Helv&eacute;tius published <em>On the
Mind</em> (<em>De l&rsquo;Esprit</em>), one of the most overtly
materialist and heterodox works of philosophy to be published during
the French Enlightenment. Although Helv&eacute;tius was not
technically an <em>encyclop&eacute;diste</em>, he certainly moved in
the same circles, and his work fit comfortably with the imaginary
template of subversive materialist <em>philosophie</em> crystallized
after the Damiens Affair. Accordingly, as the officials in charge of
securing public order, morality, and the book trade&mdash;the three
were one in absolutist France&mdash;began to crack down on
Helv&eacute;tius and <em>De l&rsquo;Esprit</em>, the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> found itself pulled into the courts as a
supposed accomplice aiding and abetting its crimes against religion,
morality, and public order.</p>

<p>
The publication <em>privil&egrave;ge</em> for <em>De
l&rsquo;Esprit</em> was revoked a month after the book appeared, and
three months later the Archbishop of Paris publicly condemned the
book. This led the <em>Parlement de Paris</em> to pursue inquiries
into a series of works it deemed subversive, including <em>De
l&rsquo;Esprit</em>. These included the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>.
In January 1759, the <em>Parlement</em> condemned them together along
with several other books for their license and impiety. While the
judges further ordered the public burning of <em>De
l&rsquo;Esprit</em>, they refrained from issuing the same order for
the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>, passing the work instead to a
committee of theologians, lawyers and scholars who were charged with
making corrective revisions. Royal authorities confirmed the
condemnation in March, revoking the original publication
<em>privil&egrave;ge</em> awarded for the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>, an act that in effect turned the volumes
into illegal, subversive books.</p>

<p>
D&rsquo;Alembert treated this decision as the death sentence for the
project, and he immediately resigned as editor, never to return to the
project again. Diderot responded less pessimistically, for his
protectors within the monarchy remained, and a deal was struck that
allowed the work to be completed. Thanks to an ad hoc and secretive
agreement, work on the final ten volumes was allowed to continue after
1759, leading to the publication en masse of the full work in 1765.
Each of these volumes carried an imprimatur indicating publication in
Neuch&acirc;tel as a way of complying with the royal ban. In this
under the table way, the technically illicit book continued to be
printed and circulated, allowing the subscriber&rsquo;s advanced
payments to be redeemed and their volumes delivered. Meanwhile, during
the same years, the volumes of accompanying plates began to appear
since their <em>privil&egrave;ge</em> was distinct and had not been
revoked in 1759. Between 1765&ndash;1772, the final volumes of the
plates were published to accompany the seventeen volumes of text that
were already in print, and with that the entire
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> was brought to completion.</p>

<p>
Yet even with the text suppressed until 1765, and only the volumes of
plates appearing, the controversy for Diderot continued throughout the
early 1760s. The public absence of new volumes of encyclopedic text
did little to stop the flow of criticism of Diderot and his imagined
&ldquo;Encyclop&eacute;diste party&rdquo;. Charles Pallisot de
Montenoy&rsquo;s satirical play <em>Les Philosophes</em>, staged in
Paris in 1760, was one widely noticed example of the wider
anti-<em>philosophe</em> campaign, which intensified in this period
and placed Diderot at its center. Although focused more on Rousseau
and Montesquieu than Diderot and the <em>encyclop&eacute;distes</em>,
Pallisot&rsquo;s satire attracted large audiences to the spectacle of
philosophers, like those involved in the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>
project, supposedly behaving badly in ways that undermined religion,
civility, and social order. Many other works joined in this chorus
during these years, and taken as a whole the public campaign against
Diderot and the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> provided him with a
persistent stream of background noise, and an occasional sting that
needed a slap, as he otherwise went about the difficult, and now
unaided, work of completing the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>
project.</p>

<h3 id="YearCele1765">3. The Years of Celebrity (1765&ndash;1773)</h3>

<p>
In 1765, after the final appearance of all seventeen volumes of the
text of the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>, and with only a few volumes
of plates still remaining to be printed, Diderot experienced a kind of
liberation as his life was freed from the work that had occupied most
of his time and energy over the previous fifteen years. A first step
in this direction occurred in 1759 with the revocation of the royal
permission to publish the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> and
d&rsquo;Alembert&rsquo;s definitive resignation as editor. In one
respect, this change increased his burdens by making him the sole
editor responsible for completing the project. But it also eased his
strain in other ways since the revocation ended the bitter public and
political struggle that Diderot had fought throughout the 1750s to
keep the project alive. During the 1760s, Diderot continued to do what
was necessary to see the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> project
completed, a job that was by no means easy&mdash;he ultimately
authored nearly six thousand articles himself. But from 1760 forward
he no longer needed to divide his time between doing this work and
sustaining the public battles on behalf of
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> as before.</p>

<p>
Accordingly, the years after 1760 brought a new quiet and calm into
Diderot&rsquo;s life as he retreated in some respects to the
background of the <em>philosophe</em> movement, and let others,
especially Voltaire, who became newly assertive at precisely this
moment, move to the front as the public face of <em>philosophie</em>.
Since the controversy surrounding the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>had
also contributed, as public controversies always do, to improved sales
of the books, Diderot also found himself in the 1760s with even more
financial security than ever before. He remained anything but rich,
but he no longer struggled as before to meet his basic needs. His
public acclaim had also created a welcoming place for him among
certain sympathetic Parisian elites, and as the burdens of the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> project became less heavy&mdash;he once
called it his hair shirt&mdash;he began to enjoy for the first time
some of the leisure afforded to well-connected writers like him by
Enlightenment Parisian society.</p>

<p>
With this liberation, a highly productive period in his life began as
new and original books and other writings began to flow from his pen.
His previous struggles still influenced this output, for after a stint
in prison and two decades of surveillance and harassment by the French
authorities responsible for the book trade, Diderot had become far
more suspicious of publication than he had been in his youth. His
output during these years was great, and his correspondence reveals a
lively circulation of his writings among trusted friends and
collaborators. Nevertheless, few of Diderot&rsquo;s writings after
1760 found their way directly into print, and even fewer made it there
with his approval. Many of his writings from this period were only
discovered and published much later, some as much as a century after
his death. Diderot also expressed an awareness of how his continual
struggle with censors affected his manner of writing. As he once
wrote, &ldquo;I saved myself by writing laconically and with
generalities and obscurity, and by finding the most intricate ironic
tone I could find&rdquo; (<em>OH</em>, DPV XXIV: 409).</p>

<p>
Scholars working with Diderot&rsquo;s letters and manuscripts have
established an imprecise chronology for his output, and that will be
followed here. But since this mature period in Diderot&rsquo;s life
also marks his move into a manner of working where he simultaneously
developed several distinct, if always related, strands of thought all
at once, a chronological approach is not an effective way to capture
his thinking and writing during these years. Much better is to group
his work thematically according to the broad clusters of thought that
his books and other writings contributed to.</p>

<h4 id="PhilInveMann1740">3.1 Philosophical Investigations in the Manner of the 1740s</h4>

<p>
Diderot&rsquo;s earliest writings from this period, pursued while the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> project was still ramping up to full
speed, continued the philosophical and literary explorations initiated
in the 1740s. Some of these works passed directly into print, while
others remained private works that Diderot kept from the public eye
for reasons that are often hard to discern. In 1751 he published
anonymously and without <em>privil&egrave;ge</em> a continuation of
sorts of his <em>Lettre sur les aveugles</em> entitled <em>Lettre sur
les sourds et muets &agrave; l&rsquo;usage de ceux qui entendent et
qui parlent.</em> At the same time, he also expanded upon his
<em>Pens&eacute;es philosophiques</em> by writing, and perhaps
allowing into print (the 1754 print edition of the book is devoid of
any indication about its origin), <em>Pens&eacute;es sur
l&rsquo;interpr&eacute;tation de la nature</em>, a work that retains
the episodic, propositional structure of Diderot&rsquo;s original
<em>Pens&eacute;es philosophiques</em> while expanding the
explanations within each section.</p>

<p>
Scholars have also suggested, though never proven definitively, that
Diderot contributed during these years to Baron
d&rsquo;Holbach&rsquo;s <em>Syst&egrave;me de la Nature, ou Des Loix
du Monde Physique et du Monde Moral</em> first published in 1770. This
book stands alongside Helv&eacute;tius&rsquo; <em>De
l&rsquo;Esprit</em> as one of the great masterpieces of French
Enlightenment materialist philosophy and natural religion, a
touchstone of Diderot&rsquo;s thought as well. D&rsquo;Holbach
contributed almost four hundred articles to the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>on topics ranging from natural philosophy
and religion to mineralogy, and Diderot was also at the center of the
coterie that assembled every week in the philosophical salon that the
Baron hosted within the secure confines of his <em>h&ocirc;tel</em> on
the rue Royale in Paris, the circle that brought <em>Syst&egrave;me de
la nature</em> to life. Diderot certainly contributed to the work in
this way, but in its dry and programmatic systematicity,
d&rsquo;Holbach&rsquo;s book also lacks the lively play of
Diderot&rsquo;s best philosophical writing. Whatever his direct
textual influence on the book, it is certain that he and
D&rsquo;Holbach were kindred spirits, and that Diderot&rsquo;s own
philosophical work was shaped by the common agendas which both pursued
during these years.</p>

<p>
Diderot&rsquo;s <em>Principes philosophiques sur la mati&egrave;re et
le mouvement</em>, written about the same time as <em>Syst&egrave;me
de la Nature</em>, and his <em>&Eacute;l&eacute;ments de
physiologie</em> and <em>R&eacute;futation
d&rsquo;Helv&eacute;tius</em>, written in the years soon after the
appearance of the treatise, though only published later in the
nineteenth century, also explore related themes. Taken as whole, all
of these works reflect Diderot&rsquo;s lifelong preoccupation with
materialist questions of life, liberty, purpose, and and the question
of order within a cosmos that may not be governed by a providential
creator. They also reveal his continuing interest in the
epistemological problem of discerning the nature and principles of
such a possibly God-less world. These themes run throughout the entire
corpus of his work, and if these writings are different it is in his
explicit engagement with explicitly materialist philosophical
investigation as they related to the emerging biological sciences of
the eighteenth century.</p>

<h4 id="LeRveDeDAle">3.2 <em>Le R&ecirc;ve de D&rsquo;Alembert</em></h4>

<p>
One of Diderot&rsquo;s great masterpieces, certainly written during
these years but only published posthumously, should be included as a
part of the natural philosophical corpus summarized above even if it
engages with the same seminal questions of natural philosophy in an
overtly literary manner that draws more on Enlightenment epistolary
novels and theater for its construction than the classical
philosophical genres of antique philosophy. Called <em>Le R&ecirc;ve
de D&rsquo;Alembert</em> (<em>D&rsquo;Alembert&rsquo;s Dream</em>),
the work is in fact a trilogy of dialogues whose centerpiece is a
dialogue from which the title is drawn. It narrates a report given to
the <em>Encyclop&eacute;diste</em> and doctor M. Bordeu of ravings
overheard at D&rsquo;Alembert&rsquo;s beside by the Parisian
<em>salonni&egrave;re</em> Mlle. de Lespinasse. The reports of
D&rsquo;Alembert&rsquo;s dreams are situated between two further
dialogues, the <em>Entretien entre D&rsquo;Alembert et Diderot</em>,
which precedes and sets up the dream reporting, and the <em>Suite de
l&rsquo;entretien</em>, which reflects on it while broaching
&ldquo;social&rdquo; topics through imaginings about the possibility
of biogenetic engineering of society. The character D&rsquo;Alembert,
who serves as a continuous thread tying the three dialogues together,
is treated ironically, given that in the first dialogue his character
has a debate with the character Diderot, in which the former defends a
kind of Cartesian substance dualism, while in the next dialogue, his
dream-utterances reveal a kind of materialist &lsquo;truth&rsquo;
which D&rsquo;Alembert has presumably repressed. In this way, Diderot
the author moves between conscious and unconscious thought so as to
shift perspectives and highlight the different possibilities that
follow from these different points of view.</p>

<p>
Taken as a whole, these three interconnected dialogues operate at two
levels, inquiring at once into serious metaphysical and
epistemological questions regarding a materialist understanding of
being and order in the world, while at the same time staging a highly
self conscious textual performance that brings into focus the style of
the conversation attendant to the philosophical exchanges themselves.
Diderot&rsquo;s early published works had this same double quality,
both philosophical and artfully literary, yet unlike these earlier
works, <em>Le R&ecirc;ve de D&rsquo;Alembert</em> was never published
by Diderot, and in fact remained buried in his manuscripts until
discovered and published in the late nineteenth century. <em>Le
R&ecirc;ve de D&rsquo;Alembert</em> was nevertheless one of
Diderot&rsquo;s favorite works (along with his mathematical essays),
and he gave one copy to Catherine the Great as a gift, together,
significantly in terms of his understanding of its place within his
oeuvre, with a set of &ldquo;Fragments&rdquo; that he presented as
belonging to his physiological writings.</p>

<p>
The substance of <em>Le R&ecirc;ve de D&rsquo;Alembert</em> reveals
some of Diderot&rsquo;s most important thinking about metaphysics as
it relates to biology and the life sciences. The first dialogue,
between Diderot and D&rsquo;Alembert, covers traditional philosophical
issues such as self and world, matter and thought, the existence of
God, sensation and the true properties of objects. The second and
longest dialogue involves the somnolent D&rsquo;Alembert, the doctor
Bordeu, and Mlle de Lespinasse, and it contains the dream reporting
noted above. This is the central dialogue of the text. The third
dialogue is shorter again, and involves only Doctor Bordeu and Mlle de
Lespinasse discussing certain issues from the dream reporting at the
heart of the main dialogue. Topics here include monsters considered as
biological and social problems, the relation between matter and
sensation, and the nature of biological reproduction with explicit
attention to its sexual dimension. Antique philosophy is also
referenced throughout, especially antique atomism, and in an earlier
conception Diderot imagined his dialogue as a conversation between
figures drawn from antiquity that would have been titled <em>Le
R&ecirc;ve de D&eacute;mocrite.</em> Diderot&rsquo;s commitment to
modern materialist philosophy was nevertheless the engine driving all
of this complex literary and philosophical play, and <em>Le
R&eacute;ve de D&rsquo;Alembert</em> accordingly contains some of
Diderot&rsquo;s most aggressive materialist explorations. Since it
would certainly have been considered a subversive work had it been
published when it was written, this may explain Diderot&rsquo;s
suppression of it. Overall, it is still an open question within
Diderot studies why he wrote the work the way he did at the time when
he wrote it, and how one should interpret the uniquely Diderotian mode
of philosophizing present in the text. What is clear, however, is that
the creative complexity converges into what is without question one of
the great masterpieces of Enlightenment <em>philosophie</em>.</p>

<h4 id="DidePlayNoveLiteEssa17601770">3.3 Diderot&rsquo;s Plays, Novels, and Literary Essays from the 1760s and 1770s</h4>

<p>
<em>Le R&ecirc;ve de D&rsquo;Alembert</em> continues to puzzle and
fascinate readers because of its alchemical fusion of literature and
philosophy, textual play and reasoned argumentation, in the pursuit of
fundamental questions about the world and humanity. The same mixture
is also present in Diderot&rsquo;s other seemingly literary and
artistic writings since these too contain much serious science and
philosophy as well.</p>

<p>
One important cluster concerns the theory and practice of theater.
Diderot wrote scripts for plays that were staged in Paris, including
<em>Le Fils naturel</em> in 1757 and <em>Le p&egrave;re de
famille</em> in 1758, but the character of these works as theatrical
productions is less interesting than his theorization of them before
and after the actual performance. As works of dramatic art,
Diderot&rsquo;s plays are dominated by his particular ethical
sensibilities, which will be discussed in detail in Part II. His
fusion of theater with moralizing agendas led to what has come to be
called Diderot&rsquo;s <em>drame bourgeois</em>, a label that suggests
Diderot&rsquo;s valorization of a morality rooted in the supreme
ethical value of the conjugal family and the virtues of thrift,
domestic love and piety. Diderot&rsquo;s plays were moralizing
melodramas that celebrated this ethic, and the same impulses were
present in his art criticism in his praise for the moralizing
paintings of Jean-Baptiste Greuze, an artist who publicly visualized
<em>drame bourgeois</em> in oil upon canvas. His ethics were also
present in his vigorous condemnation of the rococo painter
Fran&ccedil;ois Boucher, who he once described as a man &ldquo;who
takes up his brush only so that he can show me breasts and
buttocks&rdquo; (quoted in Kavanagh 2010, p. 81). Diderot also
expressed these same ethical principles as an economic theory when he
defended the abb&eacute; Galiani&rsquo;s critique of the pro-luxury
theories of the Physiocrats, and in his moralizing dialogue
<em>Entretien d&rsquo;un p&egrave;re avec ses enfants</em>, published
in Grimm&rsquo;s <em>Correspondance Litt&eacute;raire</em> in 1781,
which describes a father teaching his son about modesty and the value
of family devotion.</p>

<p>
Diderot&rsquo;s <em>drame bourgeois</em> tends toward melodrama, and
as such his plays are not major touchstones in the history of theater.
His meta-theoretical writings about theater itself, however, provide
many interesting points of departure for his philosophy, and these
will accordingly be discussed in Part II. Diderot&rsquo;s novels and
other works of overt fiction also partake in the aesthetic
explorations that mark his best work on the theater. <em>Jacques le
fataliste et son ma&icirc;tre</em>, for example, is a kind of
anti-novel, modeled on Laurence Sterne&rsquo;s <em>Tristram
Shandy.</em> It strives to expose the novelistic conceit of bringing
its readers into a staged world of realistically represented yet
fictional human experience. In this, it shares with Diderot&rsquo;s
writings on theater an interest in the nature and limits of
representation itself. Diderot&rsquo;s story <em>Ceci n&rsquo;est pas
un conte</em> also operates in a similarly self-conscious and
critically subversive way, and in these and other ostensibly literary
works, as with his theater and art criticism, the explicit play with
form and content, and the self-aware consciousness about the often
unstable interaction between language, experience and their capacity
to merge (or not) into coherent representations, points to a theme
present in all of Diderot&rsquo;s most sophisticated thought.</p>

<h4 id="DideInvePublArtCrit">3.4 Diderot&rsquo;s Invention of Public Art Criticism</h4>

<p>
Another site where Diderot manifest these same philosophical-literary
tendencies was in his art criticism. His work in this area began in
1759 when the journalist Friedrich Melchior Grimm invited Diderot to
contribute to his monthly journal <em>Correspondence
Litt&eacute;raire</em> by offering his reflections on the art
displayed at the biennial Parisian art salon. Staged in the Louvre,
these shows allowed painters and sculptors to showcase their work in a
setting that gave a broad public audience unprecedented access to the
work of the best artists of the day. The <em>Acad&eacute;mie Royale de
peinture et de sculpture</em> had been staging these shows for over
two decades when Diderot went to work, and while others had written
commentaries about the exhibitions before, no one before him had
provided anything like the critical philosophical assessment of the
art of the salons, its meaning, and its place in the world of
Enlightenment thought and culture more generally that he began to
provide.</p>

<p>
A new academically centered art theory had developed in the
seventeenth century, and by 1700 this was starting to be transformed
into a new philosophical science of aesthetics that spoke in general
terms about ideal theoretical concepts like artistic truth and beauty
and their manifestation through the work of practitioners of the fine
arts. A new persona, the connoisseur, had also become visible by 1750,
a knower who helped collectors to hone their judgment in discerning
truly great art while offering others the skills necessary to isolate
real art from the mere craft of ordinary artistic production. The
bi-annual Parisian salons had already become a site of Enlightenment
aesthetics and connoisseurship by 1750, yet before Diderot no one had
brought together the job of the connoisseur and the aesthetician with
that of the public writer reflecting on art in relation to ordinary
human experience. In his &ldquo;Salons&rdquo;, as they came to be
called after they appeared in the <em>Correspondance litteraire</em>,
Diderot brought all of these agendas together into one discursive
program. In doing so, he invented a new identity defined by a new
genre: the art critic sustained through contemporary art
criticism.</p>

<p>
The social invention itself was transformative, but even more
significant was the character of the art criticism that Diderot
developed in his pioneering new role. Here Diderot worked through the
medium of the painted image to explore exactly the same dynamics
between form and content, author and interpreter, subject and
object&mdash;in short, the very problem of artistic representation
itself&mdash;that he also explored in his theater, literary fiction,
and often in his philosophy as well. The result was a general
understanding of aesthetics and its relationship to ethics that was
also integrally connected to his philosophy, and these ties will be
discussed in detail in Part II.</p>

<h4 id="LeNeveDeRame">3.5 <em>Le Neveu de Rameau</em></h4>

<p>
Diderot&rsquo;s art criticism joined with his theater criticism, his
novels, and his other literary and philosophical writings in offering
readers reflections on deep metaphysical and epistemological questions
as they relate to the power and limits of representation. His
explicitly metaphysical and epistemological writings about nature, its
character, and its interpretation also join with this other work in
forefronting writing and representation as an empowering act of
conscious human being and knowing, but also as a fraught and frail
human capacity full of limitations. His best works are those that
engage in both sides of this dynamic simultaneously in the manner of
his literary and dialogic metaphysics and materialist natural
philosophy.</p>

<p>
From this perspective, it is appropriate that arguably Diderot&rsquo;s
greatest and most influential text is a work of both literary fiction
and a semi-autobiographical psychological memoir, and a work that is
at once a theatrical send-up of Parisian society, an intimate portrait
of contemporary social mores, and a highly original and complex study
of the nature of human perception, being, and their interrelation.
Called <em>Le Neveu de Rameau</em>, the text ostensibly narrates
Diderot&rsquo;s meetings and then conversation with the nephew of the
renowned French composer Jean-Philippe Rameau. Yet once introduced,
the dialogue unfolds through a back and forth between characters named
&ldquo;Moi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lui&rdquo;, or me and him, continually
turning a discussion between two discrete subjects into an inner
monologue of one subject dialoguing with himself. And as the exchange
carries on, one also comes to see the two characters as different
sides of a deep existential dynamic that generates both the
differences that sustain the banter and the never ending circle of
their debates. At this point the external reality of the characters
begins to dissolve, and &ldquo;Moi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lui&rdquo; start
to become two competing principles within an intractable universal
ethical and metaphysical struggle.</p>

<p>
Diderot did not publish <em>Le Neveu de Rameau</em> in his lifetime,
but the text found its way to Germany after his death, where it was
read by Friedrich Schiller and passed on to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
who then published a German translation of the text of his own making
in 1805. From there, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel found the text,
offering it as the only external work explicitly cited in his
<em>Phenomenology of Spirit</em> first published in 1807.
Diderot&rsquo;s dialogue in fact exerted an important influence on the
formation of Hegel&rsquo;s own dialectical understanding of
metaphysics and the the nature of being. In drawing these insights
from the text, Hegel was also following the deeper metaphysical
understanding, which Diderot himself developed in all of his writings
and incorporated into the book, no matter how different in genre and
idiom Diderot&rsquo;s dialogue was when compared with Hegel&rsquo;s
ponderous and recondite treatise. A line further connects Diderot and
<em>Le Neveu de Rameau</em> with all subsequent metaphysical
understandings of the self as a singularity caught in a constant
struggle with universal forces pulling the unity of being apart. It
also connects the book with all metaphysical thinking after Hegel that
posits being as a unity riven with dialectical oppositions striving to
reconcile competing oppositions within being itself. That Diderot
never produced anything like a metaphysical treatise in the manner of
Hegel&rsquo;s work in no way softens his influence on this
tradition.</p>

<h3 id="TwilYear1774">4. Twilight Years (1774&ndash;1784)</h3>

<p>
In October 1773, Diderot celebrated his sixtieth birthday in a coach
headed for the Russian imperial capital of St. Petersburg. The journey
was provoked by a series of events begun in 1765 that radically
altered Diderot&rsquo;s social position, if not necessarily the
contours of his philosophy. Although the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>
project and other developments after 1750 had created a stable
material foundation for him, making possible his intellectual
production over the subsequent decades, in 1765 he was still a man
living a very modest life in Paris with little by way of riches. His
international renown, by contrast, was enormous, and he was known and
admired by many who had both wealth and political power.</p>

<h4 id="DideEmprCathGreaRuss">4.1 Diderot and Empress Catherine the Great of Russia</h4>

<p>
One admirer was the Empress Catherine the Great of Russia, who had
watched the development of the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>with great
interest and expressed her affection for French Enlightenment
<em>philosophie</em> overall. In her so called &ldquo;Nakaz&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Instruction&rdquo; circulated to those below her in the
hierarchy of the Russian state, she laid out a program for governing
the Russian empire that was saturated with French Enlightenment ideas
and principles. She was particularly attracted to Diderot&rsquo;s
writings, and fate provided her with an occasion to express her
appreciation directly when a financial burden forced Diderot to make a
difficult decision. The dilemma was how to provide a suitable dowry
for his daughter so that she could contract the kind of favorable
marriage for her that he never experienced with his own wife. He did
not possess the resources to provide such a dowry, so in 1765 he
announced that he would sell his entire library to the highest bidder
as a way of fulfilling what he saw as his parental obligation. When
Catherine learned of the sale, she immediately made a lucrative offer,
and after her bid was accepted, she also told Diderot to set up her
new library in Paris, and to appoint himself as its permanent
librarian. This in effect allowed Catherine to give Diderot an annual
pension that made him a very wealthy man. From this date forward he
was able to live with an affluence he would never dreamed possible
thirty years earlier.</p>

<p>
The journey to St. Petersburg followed seven years later as an
opportunity for Diderot to consult directly with the empress, and
while his health was in decline, making the voyage difficult for him,
he described the encounter pleasantly, saying that he spoke with the
Russian Tsarina &ldquo;man to man&rdquo;. He also offered her his own
<em>Observations sur le &ldquo;Nakaz&rdquo;</em>, a document that
offers, along with his article &ldquo;Droit naturel&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Natural right&rdquo;), one of the clearest statements of
Diderot&rsquo;s political views. He urged Catherine to promote greater
equality, both politically and economically, and to encourage less
attachment to the Church. Catherine reported to a French aristocrat
afterwards that if Diderot&rsquo;s suggestions were ever to be
enacted, chaos would ensue. Diderot also gave Catherine a plan for
creating a new university, one organized according to the latest
thinking about modern scientific knowledge. This document offers
revealing insight into Diderot&rsquo;s thinking about the organization
of knowledge and the state of the disciplines two decades after his
theorization of them for the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>.</p>

<h4 id="LateWrit">4.2 The Late Writings</h4>

<p>
Diderot spent his sixty-first birthday in 1774 in a stagecoach heading
back home from St. Petersburg, and once re-installed in Paris in the
new comfort that Catherine&rsquo;s library endowment made possible,
he began a kind of retirement where he continued to write while
turning his attention to a new topic: history. One example was his
<em>Essai sur les r&egrave;gnes de Claude et de N&eacute;ron</em>,
which reflected the turn of his continuing long standing interest in
ethics and morality toward questions of politics, justice, and
history. Also reflective of this new union was his intervention in the
final editions of the abb&eacute; Guillaume Thomas Raynal&rsquo;s
massive global history entitled <em>Histoire philosophique et
politique des &eacute;tablissements et du commerce des
Europ&eacute;ens dans les deux Indes</em>. This book, which ran to
nineteen volumes, was produced by Raynal in a manner akin to the
<em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em>, with numerous authors contributing and
Raynal massaging the various contributions into a coherent whole. The
history overall was pioneering. Opening with the claim that no greater
change had occurred in all of world history than the one that ensued
when Columbus arrived in the Americas in 1492, opening up the Western
hemisphere for European global expansion and conquest, the book then
narrated the history of European globalization and empire since the
fifteenth century, ranging across India, China, Africa and the Pacific
along with a history of European exploration and conquest in the
Americas.</p>

<p>
No history like this had ever been written before, nor had any
compendium of this sort documenting European global expansion and
imperialism ever been assembled. The book lacks a single narrative
voice, and overall it is a loose baggy monster combining chapters full
of quantitative trade data and empirical natural history of the
world&rsquo;s material resources together with theatrical speeches
delivered by the book&rsquo;s historical actors and moralizing
narratives of the calamities and triumphs of European imperial
history. Overall, the book does not offer a coherent, unified world
history in our modern sense, even if Diderot often used his
contributions to advance broad conceptual theories that prefigured the
later world-historical theorization of Hegel and Marx. It is better
described as the Enlightenment&rsquo;s <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> of
early modern globalization and empire.</p>

<p>
The analogy to the <em>Encyclop&eacute;die</em> project also fits with
Diderot&rsquo;s role in the project, for having watched as his friend
Raynal brought out the first two print editions in 1770 and 1777,
Diderot intervened in the final print edition of 1780, offering a
largely new set of dramatic narrations and normative arguments about
the book&rsquo;s contents that gave the treatise as a whole a new
political edge.</p>

<p>
Although it is difficult to summarize the variety of Diderot&rsquo;s
contributions, one dominant theme was his exploration of the power of
commerce, conceived as an autonomous natural historical force, to
drive political and social change. On some occasions he celebrates the
power of commerce to bring about the progress of civilization that he
wants readers to see, a position that makes him emblematic of what
A.O. Hirschman has called the &ldquo;<em>doux commerce</em>&rdquo;
strand of Enlightenment political economy, a thread crucial to the
formation of modern liberalism. On other occasions, however, Diderot
decries the way that commercial greed and profit-seeking produce
outrageous violations of human decency and violence. These are moments
when his writings do not prefigure liberalism, but its opposite, the
anti-liberal critique of political economy that would later become the
basis of Marxism in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>
The Atlantic slave trade in particular attracted Diderot&rsquo;s
attention, and some of his most passionate contributions to
Raynal&rsquo;s work involve imagined dialogues about the horrors of
the European imperial slave system spoken by oppressed Africans.
Diderot also exploits the global frame of the book to situate his gaze
in alien and non-European ways so that he can assess and critique the
history he is narrating. The result is a kind of pioneering, if ad hoc
and personal, universal anthropological viewpoint that aspires to
understand human life at the intersection of history, culture and
material existence as viewed from every point of view. The
<em>Histoire philosophique des deux Indes</em> which contains these
passages was a massive bestseller, translated into many languages, and
it was a direct influence on Hegel, and through him Marx, and through
both on modern world history more generally. Diderot&rsquo;s
contribution to this influence was as important as any.</p>

<p>
Diderot used the same proto-anthropological approach in another
provocative work from his later years, his <em>Suppl&eacute;ment au
voyage de Bougainville.</em> This text offers an imagined dialogue
between Tahitians and Europeans about the different sexual, marital
and familial mores of the two cultures. In this dialogue, Diderot
anticipates the figure of the native ethnographer who asks comparative
questions about the foundations of morality and civilization so as to
generate universal cultural understandings through comparison. In the
<em>Histoire des deux Indes</em>, Diderot adds a political charge to
such thinking by using the native stance to indict the crimes of the
European imperialist, but both this text and the
<em>Suppl&eacute;ment</em> show Diderot&rsquo;s interest in creating a
reflexive universal understanding of human values, society, and
culture through the perspectival exploration of the many different
ways that perceiving subjects and natural objects join together to
produce one another.</p>

<p>
In his <em>Suppl&eacute;ment</em>, his contributions to Raynal&rsquo;s
<em>Histoire</em>, and his <em>Observations sur le
&ldquo;Nakaz&rdquo;</em>, Diderot appears in a newly radical political
guise as an aggressive egalitarian and democrat who has little
patience with traditional justifications for hierarchy and top down
distributions of power. He is also a passionate abolitionist with no
tolerance for the crimes of the Atlantic slave trade. These views
connect him with Rousseau, who would be canonized as the
<em>philosophe</em> prophet of revolution by the radical Jacobins who
established the first French Republic. Several authors including
Michelet and Hugo exploited the trope &ldquo;from Diderot sprang
Danton&rdquo;. As Hugo wrote, &ldquo;one can see Danton behind
Diderot, Robespierre behind Rousseau &hellip; the latter engendered
the former&rdquo; (Hugo 1876, vol. 7: 76, translation C. Wolfe).  Yet
while Hugo saw a revolutionary link between the two
Enlightenment <em>philosophes</em>, Diderot was not canonized like
Rousseau as a founding father of the French revolutionary
tradition. His ideas nevertheless pointed in many of the same
directions, and they also stem from his wider philosophy, especially
his metaphysics, in ways that make his political philosophy a more
direct precursor for the radical political philosophy of the next two
centuries.</p>

<p>
Nature does not work through hierarchy in Diderot&rsquo;s
understanding, and the absolute demarcation of distinct species and
beings is not possible in Diderot&rsquo;s conception of nature. The
politics that such a natural philosophy suggests is one rooted in a
need for a radical decentralization of power and authority, and a
fully bottom-up and egalitarian understanding of social order. Also
crucial is a fluid and flexible understanding of social structures as
entities forever changing and modifying through the ever flowing
movement of time. Although he never laid out a single utopian vision
of his model society, nor offered a fully elaborated statement of his
political philosophy, one sees it at work in his writings in his
ever-persistent critique of the necessity of established tradition and
the institutions that uphold it. It is also present in his continual
return to a universal and all-inclusive democratic base as the only
foundation for any true conception of the social order.</p>

<p>
His deep convictions about the universal oneness and equality of
humanity is also manifest in his thinking about race and slavery,
where he rejected altogether the new anthropology promulgated by Kant
and others that spoke of biologically and civilizational distinct
races of men scattered around the world through a natural
climatological division. Diderot offered instead a monogenetic
understanding of humanity composed from beings whose differences were
a matter of degree rather than kind. This made him not only a critic
of slavery and of racialized understandings of history and politics,
but a full-fledged abolitionist, one whose sensibilities suggested,
even if he never stated his explicit political commitments directly,
the proto-democratic positions that sat at the radical edge of the
political spectrum in the 1780s. Diderot nevertheless rarely sought to
connect his materialist metaphysical commitments with his political
thinking, not least due to his distaste for the way that his fellow
materialist La Mettrie produced an &ldquo;immoralist&rdquo; ethics and
a cynical social theory. Ultimately, Diderot was by nature a writer
and thinker, not a political activist, and his political philosophy
stands in his writings as the least developed aspect of his
thought.</p>

<h4 id="PostLega">4.3 The Posthumous Legacy</h4>

<p>
In his relation to politics, as in so many other ways, Diderot was
different from Voltaire, who always sustained his philosophy through
his politics, and who became more politically active as he aged.
Diderot&rsquo;s egalitarian and proto-democratic political vision is
best understood as part and parcel of his life spent in pursuit of
philosophical naturalism, and politically he was akin to Rousseau, who
also spent his twilight years in writerly philosophic retreat. Yet
when revolution erupted a decade later, the memory of Voltaire and
Rousseau was forged into a link tying the French Enlightenment
<em>philosophes</em> to the cause of revolutionary democracy. In 1792,
when the First French Republic created the initial pantheon of
revolutionary heroes worthy of immortal commemoration, Voltaire and
Rousseau were chosen as the first inductees, while Diderot was at best
forgotten and at worst treated as a figure hostile to the new
political movements afoot.</p>

<p>
This combination of neglect and outright hostility pushed Diderot to
the margins of French culture in the nineteenth century, and it would
take another century before retrospective interest in his work would
be renewed. A host of cultural forces conspired to make Diderot the
least interesting of the French Enlightenment <em>philosophes</em> in
the minds of nineteenth-century thinkers. Too systematically committed
to his materialism, too vigorous in his irreligion, and too passionate
and principled in his embrace of egalitarianism and universal
democracy to be acceptable to anyone with the slightest worry about
the rising tides of radical socialism and materialist freethought,
Diderot became a pariah within the nineteenth-century conservative
reaction of the Victorian era in Europe.</p>

<p>
Unlike Spinoza, who famously had a complicated posterity in which he
was both the despicable atheist and the &lsquo;God-drunken&rsquo;
Romantic, Diderot was viewed with suspicion for being some version of
an Epicurean materialist with immoralist tendencies. Goethe, who was
fascinated with Diderot and translated the <em>Neveu de Rameau</em>
into German, nevertheless spoke in these terms when he decried
Diderot&rsquo;s lack of bourgeois morality: &ldquo;Oh wonderful
Diderot, why do you always use your considerable intellectual powers
in the service of disorder rather than order?&rdquo; (1799 notes on
Diderot&rsquo;s <em>Essai sur la peinture</em>, in Goethe 1799 [1925:
X, 144&ndash;145]). Such reductions of Diderot to nothing more than a
superficial and reckless subversive lasted a surprisingly long time,
and a continuous thread connects the French critic Jules Barbey
d&rsquo;Aurevilly&rsquo;s mid-nineteenth century declaration that
Goethe was a genius while Diderot was a shallow imitator with the
characterization of Diderot found in the Lagarde et Michard French
literature textbook, a standard in French high schools as late as the
1970s, which described his writing as &ldquo;very material&rdquo;,
which is to say coarse, physical, and bodily in nature, a trait that
made Diderot, and by extension his affectionate readers, predisposed
to materialism and base morality. Given his impropriety when judged by
nineteenth-century bourgeois values, it was perhaps not surprising
that after 1900 Soviet Marxists played a key role in reviving Diderot
scholarship (a process in which Lenin&rsquo;s favorable discussion of
the <em>R&ecirc;ve de D&rsquo;Alembert</em> played a role). This was
not merely through an attempt to present French Enlightenment
materialists like Helv&eacute;tius or Diderot as heroes of a kind of
class struggle in philosophy <em>avant la lettre</em>, but also
through a serious and positive engagement with Diderot&rsquo;s
writings. </p>

<p>
Diderot&rsquo;s brilliant eclecticism, which made him neither a pure
philosopher, nor a straightforward <em>litteraire</em>, also made it
hard for him to find a place in the newly specializing terrain of
nineteenth century thought. Too innovative and idiosyncratic in his
intellectual style to fit neatly into the rigid grid of the new
university-based disciplinary system, he failed to find a home in this
setting as well. Only after 1870 was interest in his work revived,
thanks in part to the new critical editions of his writings, which
made him newly available to scholars and readers, and to the changing
cultural and political climate, which made him newly relevant to
contemporary concerns. Contemporary Diderot studies, which is thriving
today, was the result of that turn, and it is really only about a
hundred years old, with most of the foundational studies even younger
than that. The bulk of this work was accomplished by literary
scholars, who tend to treat Diderot as an avant-garde writer first and
foremost, and only as a philosopher in name and self-definition.
Recently, however, scholars attuned to the very different character of
philosophy and science in the eighteenth century have begun to return
to Diderot&rsquo;s work, and to find in it the complex and
sophisticated thinking that was his hallmark.</p>

<p>
There was even a movement afoot as recently as 2013 to enshrine
Diderot alongside Rousseau, Voltaire, and Condorcet in the
Panth&eacute;on of French national heroes. Headlines worrying about
&ldquo;<em>un homme dangereux au Panth&eacute;on?</em>&rdquo; revealed
the continuing influence of his alleged infamy, and in other ways
Diderot&rsquo;s materialist philosophy continues to shape his
posthumous legacy in direct ways. The Diderot scholar Jacques
Chouillet recounted, for example, that during the discussions of this
Pantheonization it was suggested that Diderot&rsquo;s remains be
obtained in preparation for his possible consecration in the French
national monument. Chouillet, however, explained that this was not
possible because in the 1820s, when structural repairs had been made
to the Chapel of the Virgin in the &Eacute;glise Saint-Roch, where
Diderot was said to have been buried, workers found no remains of
Diderot in his grave. Further inquiries revealed that Diderot had in
fact been buried in this spot in a lead coffin in 1784, and that his
absence in the 1820s was the result of looting in 1794 during the
widespread search for lead needed to make bullets for the French
revolutionary armies then fighting to defend the First Republic from
anti-revolutionary invaders. With no extant material remains of
Diderot to consecrate, his Panth&eacute;onizaion was hindered, but in
other ways, this predicament might have been an appropriate end for a
man who was fond of distributed understandings of the relation between
matter and life. What better commemoration for Diderot, commented
Chouillet, than the dispersion of his material ashes into the
revolutionary tumult that he did so much to stimulate? The material
body of Diderot may be gone for ever, but perhaps the most fitting
remembrance for him, especially from the perspective of his own
materialist philosophy, is the memory of him dissolved after his death
into the spirit of his times (Chouillet 1991: 42).</p>

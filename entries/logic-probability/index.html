<h2 id="CombLogiProbTheo">1. Combining Logic and Probability Theory</h2>

<p>
The very idea of combining logic and probability might look strange at
first sight (H&aacute;jek 2001). After all, logic is concerned with
absolutely certain truths and inferences, whereas probability theory
deals with uncertainties. Furthermore, logic offers a
<em>qualitative</em> (structural) perspective on inference (the
deductive validity of an argument is based on the argument&rsquo;s
formal structure), whereas probabilities are <em>quantitative</em>
(numerical) in nature. However, as will be shown in the next section,
there are natural senses in which probability theory
<em>presupposes</em> and <em>extends</em> classical logic.
Furthermore, historically speaking, several distinguished theorists
such as De Morgan (1847), Boole (1854), Ramsey (1926), de Finetti
(1937), Carnap (1950), Jeffrey (1992) and Howson (2003, 2007, 2009)
have emphasized the tight connections between logic and probability,
or even considered their work on probability as a part of logic
itself.</p>

<p>
By integrating the complementary perspectives of qualitative logic and
numerical probability theory, probability logics are able to offer
highly expressive accounts of inference. It should therefore come as
no surprise that they have been applied in all fields that study
reasoning mechanisms, such as philosophy, artificial intelligence,
cognitive science and mathematics. The downside to this
cross-disciplinary popularity is that terms such as &lsquo;probability
logic&rsquo; are used by different researchers in different,
non-equivalent ways. Therefore, before moving on to the actual
discussion of the various approaches, we will first delineate the
subject matter of this entry.</p>

<p>
The most important distinction is that between <em>probability
logic</em> and <em>inductive logic</em>. Classically, an argument is
said to be <em>(deductively) valid</em> if and only if it is
impossible that the premises of \(A\) are all true, while its
conclusion is false. In other words, deductive validity amounts to
<em>truth preservation</em>: in a valid argument, the truth of the
premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In some arguments,
however, the truth of the premises does not fully guarantee the truth
of the conclusion, but it still renders it highly likely. A typical
example is the argument with premises &lsquo;The first swan I saw was
white&rsquo;, &hellip;, &lsquo;The 1000th swan I saw was white&rsquo;,
and conclusion &lsquo;All swans are white&rsquo;. Such arguments are
studied in <em>inductive logic</em>, which makes extensive use of
probabilistic notions, and is therefore considered by some authors to
be related to probability logic. There is some discussion about the
exact relation between inductive logic and probability logic, which is
summarized in the introduction of Kyburg (1994). The dominant position
(defended by Adams and Levine (1975), among others), which is also
adopted here, is that probability logic entirely belongs to deductive
logic, and hence should not be concerned with inductive reasoning.
Still, most work on inductive logic falls within the
&lsquo;probability preservation&rsquo; approach, and is thus closely
connected to the systems discussed in
 <a href="#PropProbLogi">Section 2</a>.
 For more on inductive logic, the reader can consult Jaynes (2003),
Fitelson (2006), Romeijn (2011), and the entries on
 <a href="../induction-problem/index.html">the problem of induction</a>
 and
 <a href="../logic-inductive/index.html">inductive logic</a>
 of this encyclopedia.</p>

<p>
We will also steer clear of the philosophical debate over the exact
nature of probability. The formal systems discussed here are
compatible with all of the common interpretations of probability, but
obviously, in concrete applications, certain interpretations of
probability will fit more naturally than others. For example, the
modal probability logics discussed in 
 <a href="#ModaProbLogi">Section 4</a>
 are, by themselves, neutral about the nature of probability, but when
they are used to describe the behavior of a transition system, their
probabilities are typically interpreted in an objective way, whereas
modeling multi-agent scenarios is accompanied most naturally by a
subjective interpretation of probabilities (as agents&rsquo; degrees
of belief). This topic is covered in detail in Gillies (2000), Eagle
(2010), and the entry on
 <a href="../probability-interpret/index.html">interpretations of probability</a>
 of this encyclopedia.</p>

<p>
A recent trend in the literature has been to focus less on integrating
or combining logic and probability theory into a single, unified
framework, but rather to establish bridges between the two
disciplines. This typically involves trying to capture the qualitative
notions of logic in the quantitative terms of probability theory, or
the other way around. We will not be able to do justice to the wide
variety of approaches in this booming area, but interested readers can
consult Leitgeb (2013, 2014), Lin and Kelly (2012a, 2012b), Douven and
Rott (2018), and Harrison-Trainor, Holliday and Icard (2016, 2018). A
&lsquo;contemporary classic&rsquo; in this area is Leitgeb (2017),
while van Benthem (2017) offers a useful survey and some interesting
programmatic remarks.</p>

<p>
Finally, although the success of probability logic is largely due to
its various applications, we will not deal with these applications in
any detail. For example, we will not assess the use of probability as
a formal representation of belief in philosophy (Bayesian
epistemology) or artificial intelligence (knowledge representation),
and its advantages and disadvantages with respect to alternative
representations, such as generalized probability theory (for quantum
theory), \(p\)-adic probability, and fuzzy logic. For more information
about these topics, the reader can consult Gerla (1994), Vennekens et
al. (2009), H&aacute;jek and Hartmann (2010), Hartmann and Sprenger
(2010), Ili&#263;-Stepi&#263; et al.&nbsp;(2012), and the entries on
 <a href="../formal-belief/index.html">formal representations of belief</a>,
 <a href="../epistemology-bayesian/index.html">Bayesian epistemology</a>,
 <a href="../reasoning-defeasible/index.html">defeasible reasoning</a>,
 <a href="../qt-quantlog/index.html">quantum logic and probability theory</a>, and
 <a href="../logic-fuzzy/index.html">fuzzy logic</a>
 of this encyclopedia.</p>

<p>
With these clarifications in place, we are now ready to look at what
<em>will</em> be discussed in this entry. The most common strategy to
obtain a concrete system of probability logic is to start with a
classical (propositional/modal/etc.) system of logic and to
&lsquo;probabilify&rsquo; it in one way or another, by adding
probabilistic features to it. There are various ways in which this
probabilification can be implemented. One can study probabilistic
semantics for classical languages (which do not have any explicit
probabilistic operators), in which case the consequence relation
itself gets a probabilistic flavor: deductive validity becomes
&lsquo;probability preservation&rsquo;, rather than &lsquo;truth
preservation&rsquo;. This direction will be discussed in 
 <a href="#PropProbLogi">Section 2</a>. 
 Alternatively, one can add various kinds of probabilistic
operators to the syntax of the logic. In 
 <a href="#BasiProbOper">Section 3</a>
 we will discuss some initial, rather basic examples of probabilistic
operators. The full expressivity of modal probabilistic operators will
be explored in 
 <a href="#ModaProbLogi">Section 4</a>. 
Finally, languages with first-order probabilistic operators will be
discussed in 
 <a href="#FirsOrdeProbLogi">Section 5</a>.</p>

<h2 id="PropProbLogi">2. Propositional Probability Logics</h2>

<p>
In this section, we will present a first family of probability logics,
which are used to study questions of &lsquo;probability
preservation&rsquo; (or dually, &lsquo;uncertainty
propagation&rsquo;). These systems do not extend the language with any
probabilistic operators, but rather deal with a
&lsquo;classical&rsquo; propositional language \(\mathcal{L}\), which
has a countable set of atomic propositions, and the usual
truth-functional (Boolean) connectives.</p>

<p>
The main idea is that the premises of a valid argument can be
uncertain, in which case (deductive) validity imposes no conditions on
the (un)certainty of the conclusion. For example, the argument with
premises &lsquo;if it will rain tomorrow, I will get wet&rsquo; and
&lsquo;it will rain tomorrow&rsquo;, and conclusion &lsquo;I will get
wet&rsquo; is valid, but if its second premise is uncertain, its
conclusion will typically also be uncertain. Propositional probability
logics represent such uncertainties as probabilities, and study how
they &lsquo;flow&rsquo; from the premises to the conclusion; in other
words, they do not study <em>truth preservation</em>, but rather
<em>probability preservation</em>. The following three subsections
discuss systems that deal with increasingly more general versions of
this issue.</p>

<h3 id="ProbSema">2.1 Probabilistic Semantics</h3>

<p>
We begin by recalling the notion of a probability function for the
propositional language \(\mathcal{L}\). (In mathematics, probability
functions are usually defined for a \(\sigma\)-algebra of subsets of a
given set \(\Omega\), and required to satisfy countable additivity;
cf. 
 <a href="#ProbSpac">Section 4.3</a>. 
 In logical
contexts, however, it is often more natural to define probability
functions &lsquo;immediately&rsquo; for the logic&rsquo;s object
language (Williamson 2002). Because this language is
finitary&mdash;all its formulas have finite length&mdash;, it also
suffices to require finite additivity.) A <em>probability function
(for \(\mathcal{L}\))</em> is a function \(P: \mathcal{L}\to
\mathbb{R}\) satisfying the following constraints:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Non-negativity.</strong> \(P(\phi)\geq 0\) for all
\(\phi\in\mathcal{L}.\) </p>

<p>
<strong>Tautologies.</strong> If \(\models\phi\), then
\(P(\phi)=1.\)</p>

<p>
<strong>Finite additivity.</strong> If
\(\models\neg(\phi\wedge\psi)\), then \(P(\phi\vee\psi) =
P(\phi)+P(\psi).\) </p>
</div>

<p>
In the second and third constraint, the \(\models\)-symbol denotes
(semantic) validity in classical propositional logic. The definition
of probability functions thus requires notions from classical logic,
and in this sense probability theory can be said to
<em>presuppose</em> classical logic (Adams 1998, 22). It can easily be
shown that if \(P\) satisfies these constraints, then \(P(\phi)\in
[0,1]\) for all formulas \(\phi\in\mathcal{L}\), and \(P(\phi) =
P(\psi)\) for all formulas \(\phi,\psi\in\mathcal{L}\) that are
logically equivalent (i.e. such that
\(\models\phi\leftrightarrow\psi\)).</p>

<p>
We now turn to probabilistic semantics, as defined in Leblanc (1983).
An argument with premises \(\Gamma\) and conclusion
\(\phi\)&mdash;henceforth denoted as \((\Gamma,\phi)\)&mdash;is said
to be <em>probabilistically valid</em>, written
\(\Gamma\models_p\phi\), if and only if:</p>

<p class="center">
for all probability functions \(P:\mathcal{L}\to\mathbb{R}\):
<br />
if \(P(\gamma) = 1\) for all \(\gamma\in\Gamma\), then also \(P(\phi)
= 1\).</p>

<p>
Probabilistic semantics thus replaces the valuations
\(v:\mathcal{L}\to\{0,1\}\) of classical propositional logic with
probability functions \(P:\mathcal{L}\to \mathbb{R}\), which take
values in the real unit interval \([0,1]\). The classical truth values
of <em>true</em> (1) and <em>false</em> (0) can thus be regarded as
the endpoints of the unit interval \([0,1]\), and likewise, valuations
\(v:\mathcal{L}\to\{0,1\}\) can be regarded as degenerate probability
functions \(P:\mathcal{L}\to[0,1]\). In this sense, classical logic is
a special case of probability logic, or equivalently, probability
logic is an <em>extension</em> of classical logic.</p>

<p>
It can be shown that classical propositional logic is (strongly) sound
and complete with respect to probabilistic semantics:</p> 

\[\Gamma \models_p \phi \text{ if and only if } \Gamma \vdash\phi.\]

<p>
Some authors interpret probabilities as generalized truth values
(Reichenbach 1949, Leblanc 1983). According to this view, probability
logic is just a particular kind of many-valued logic, and
probabilistic validity boils down to &lsquo;truth preservation&rsquo;:
truth (i.e.&nbsp;probability 1) carries over from the premises to the
conclusion. Other logicians, such as Tarski (1936) and Adams (1998,
15), have noted that probabilities cannot be seen as generalized truth
values, because probability functions are not
&lsquo;extensional&rsquo;; for example, \(P(\phi\wedge\psi)\) cannot
be expressed as a function of \(P(\phi)\) and \(P(\psi)\). More
discussion on this topic can be found in Hailperin (1984).</p>

<p>
Another possibility is to interpret a sentence&rsquo;s probability as
a measure of its (un)certainty. For example, the sentence &lsquo;Jones
is in Spain at the moment&rsquo; can have any degree of certainty,
ranging from 0 (maximal uncertainty) to 1 (maximal certainty). (Note
that 0 is actually a kind of certainty, viz.&nbsp;certainty about
falsity; however, in this entry we follow Adams&rsquo; terminology
(1998, 31) and interpret 0 as maximal uncertainty.) According to this
interpretation, the following theorem follows from the strong
soundness and completeness of probabilistic semantics:</p>

<p class="indent">
<strong>Theorem 1.</strong> Consider a deductively valid argument
\((\Gamma,\phi)\). If all premises in \(\Gamma\) have probability 1,
then the conclusion \(\phi\) also has probability 1.</p>

<p>
This theorem can be seen as a first, very partial clarification of the
issue of probability preservation (or uncertainty propagation). It
says that if there is no uncertainty whatsoever about the premises,
then there cannot be any uncertainty about the conclusion either. In
the next two subsections we will consider more interesting cases, when
there is non-zero uncertainty about the premises, and ask how it
carries over to the conclusion.</p>

<p>
Finally, it should be noted that although this subsection only
discussed probabilistic semantics for classical propositional logic,
there are also probabilistic semantics for a variety of other logics,
such as intuitionistic propositional logic (van Fraassen 1981b, Morgan
and Leblanc 1983), modal logics (Morgan 1982a, 1982b, 1983, Cross
1993), classical first-order logic (Leblanc 1979, 1984, van Fraassen
1981b), relevant logic (van Fraassen 1983) and nonmonotonic logic
(Pearl 1991). All of these systems share a key feature: the
logic&rsquo;s semantics is probabilistic in nature, but probabilities
are <em>not</em> explicitly represented in the object language; hence,
they are much closer in nature to the propositional probability logics
discussed here than to the systems presented in later sections.</p>

<p>
Most of these systems are not based on unary probabilities
\(P(\phi)\), but rather on conditional probabilities \(P(\phi,\psi)\).
The conditional probability \(P(\phi,\psi)\) is taken as primitive
(rather than being defined as \(P(\phi\wedge\psi)/P(\psi)\), as is
usually done) to avoid problems when \(P(\psi)=0\). Goosens (1979)
provides an overview of various axiomatizations of probability theory
in terms of such primitive notions of conditional probability.</p>

<h3 id="AdamProbLogi">2.2 Adams&rsquo; Probability Logic</h3>

<p>
In the previous subsection we discussed a first principle of
probability preservation, which says that if all premises have
probability 1, then the conclusion also has probability 1. Of course,
more interesting cases arise when the premises are less than
absolutely certain. Consider the valid argument with premises \(p\vee
q\) and \(p\to q\), and conclusion \(q\) (the symbol
&lsquo;\(\to\)&rsquo; denotes the truth-conditional material
conditional). One can easily show that </p> 

\[P(q) = P(p\vee q) + P(p\to q) - 1.\]

<p>
In other words, if we know the probabilities of the argument&rsquo;s
premises, then we can calculate the exact probability of its
conclusion, and thus provide a complete answer to the question of
probability preservation for this particular argument (for example, if
\(P(p \vee q) = 6/7\) and \(P(p\to q) = 5/7\), then \(P(q) = 4/7\)).
In general, however, it will not be possible to calculate the
<em>exact</em> probability of the conclusion, given the probabilities
of the premises; rather, the best we can hope for is a (tight) upper
and/or lower <em>bound</em> for the conclusion&rsquo;s probability. We
will now discuss Adams&rsquo; (1998) methods to compute such
bounds.</p>

<p>
Adams&rsquo; results can be stated more easily in terms of
<em>uncertainty</em> rather than <em>certainty</em> (probability).
Given a probability function \(P:\mathcal{L}\to [0,1]\), the
corresponding <em>uncertainty function</em> \(U_P\) is defined as </p>

\[U_P:\mathcal{L}\to[0,1]: \phi\mapsto U_P(\phi):= 1-P(\phi).\]

<p>
If the probability function \(P\) is clear from the context, we will
often simply write \(U\) instead of \(U_P\). In the remainder of this
subsection (and in the next one as well) we will assume that all
arguments have only finitely many premises (which is not a significant
restriction, given the compactness property of classical propositional
logic). Adams&rsquo; first main result, which was originally
established by Suppes (1966), can now be stated as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 2.</strong> Consider a valid argument
\((\Gamma,\phi)\) and a probability function \(P\). Then the
uncertainty of the conclusion \(\phi\) cannot exceed the sum of the
uncertainties of the premises \(\gamma\in\Gamma\). Formally: </p>

\[U(\phi) \leq \sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}U(\gamma).\]

</div>

<p>
First of all, note that this theorem subsumes Theorem 1 as a special
case: if \(P(\gamma) = 1\) for all \(\gamma\in\Gamma\), then
\(U(\gamma)=0\) for all \(\gamma\in\Gamma\), so \(U(\phi)\leq \sum
U(\gamma) = 0\) and thus \(P(\phi) = 1\). Furthermore, note that the
upper bound on the uncertainty of the conclusion depends on
\(|\Gamma|\), i.e.&nbsp;on the number of premises. If a valid argument
has a small number of premises, each of which only has a small
uncertainty (i.e.&nbsp;a high certainty), then its conclusion will
also have a reasonably small uncertainty (i.e.&nbsp;a reasonably high
certainty). Conversely, if a valid argument has premises with small
uncertainties, then its conclusion can only be highly uncertain if the
argument has a large number of premises (a famous illustration of this
converse principle is Kyburg&rsquo;s (1965) <em>lottery paradox</em>,
which is discussed in the entry on
 <a href="../epistemic-paradoxes/index.html">epistemic paradoxes</a>
 of this encyclopedia). To put the matter more concretely, note that
if a valid argument has three premises which each have uncertainty
1/11, then adding a premise which also has uncertainty 1/11 will not
influence the argument&rsquo;s validity, but it <em>will</em> raise
the upper bound on the conclusion&rsquo;s uncertainty from 3/11 to
4/11&mdash;thus allowing the conclusion to be more uncertain than was
originally the case. Finally, the upper bound provided by Theorem 2 is
<em>optimal</em>, in the sense that (under the right conditions) the
uncertainty of the conclusion can coincide with its upper bound \(\sum
U(\gamma)\):</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.</strong> Consider a valid argument
\((\Gamma,\phi)\), and assume that the premise set \(\Gamma\) is
consistent, and that every premise \(\gamma\in\Gamma\) is relevant
(i.e.&nbsp;\(\Gamma-\{\gamma\}\not\models\phi\)). Then there exists a
probability function \(P:\mathcal{L}\to[0,1]\) such that</p>

\[U_P(\phi) = \sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}U_P(\gamma).\]

</div>

<p>
The upper bound provided by Theorem 2 can also be used to define a
probabilistic notion of validity. An argument \((\Gamma,\phi)\) is
said to be <em>Adams-probabilistically valid</em>, written
\(\Gamma\models_a\phi\), if and only if</p>

<p class="center">
for all probability functions \(P:\mathcal{L}\to\mathbb{R}\):
\(U_P(\phi)\leq \sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}U_P(\gamma)\).</p>

<p>
Adams-probabilistic validity has an alternative, equivalent
characterization in terms of probabilities rather than uncertainties.
This characterization says that \((\Gamma,\phi)\) is
Adams-probabilistically valid if and only if the conclusion&rsquo;s
probability can get arbitrarily close to 1 if the premises&rsquo;
probabilities are sufficiently high. Formally: \(\Gamma\models_a\phi\)
if and only if</p>

<p class="center">
for all \(\epsilon&gt;0\) there exists a \(\delta&gt;0\) such that for
all probability functions \(P\):
<br />
if \(P(\gamma)&gt;1-\delta\) for all \(\gamma\in\Gamma\), then
\(P(\phi)&gt; 1-\epsilon\).</p>

<p>
It can be shown that classical propositional logic is (strongly) sound
and complete with respect to Adams&rsquo; probabilistic semantics:
</p> 

\[\Gamma \models_a \phi \text{ if and only if } \Gamma \vdash\phi.\]

<p>
Adams (1998, 154) also defines another logic for which his
probabilistic semantics is sound and complete. However, this system
involves a non-truth-functional connective (the <em>probability
conditional</em>), and therefore falls outside the scope of this
section. (For more on probabilistic interpretations of conditionals,
the reader can consult the entries on
 <a href="../conditionals/index.html">conditionals</a>
 and
 <a href="../logic-conditionals/index.html">the logic of conditionals</a>
 of this encyclopedia.)</p>

<p>
Consider the following example. The argument \(A\) with premises
\(p,q,r,s\) and conclusion \(p\wedge(q\vee r)\) is valid. Assume that
\(P(p) = 10/11, P(q) = P(r) = 9/11\) and \(P(s) = 7/11\). Then Theorem
2 says that </p> 

\[\begin{align}
&amp;U(p\wedge(q\vee r)) \leq \\
&amp;\quad\frac{1}{11} + \frac{2}{11} + \frac{2}{11} + \frac{4}{11} = \frac{9}{11}.
\end{align}\]

<p>
This upper bound on the uncertainty of the conclusion is rather
disappointing, and it exposes the main weakness of Theorem 2. One of
the reasons why the upper bound is so high, is that to compute it we
took into account the premise \(s\), which has a rather high
uncertainty (\(4/11\)). However, this premise is irrelevant, in the
sense that the conclusion already follows from the other three
premises. Hence we can regard \(p\wedge (q\vee r)\) not only as the
conclusion of the valid argument \(A\), but also as the conclusion of
the (equally valid) argument \(A'\), which has premises \(p,q,r\). In
the latter case Theorem 2 yields an upper bound of \(1/11 + 2/11 +
2/11 = 5/11\), which is already much lower.</p>

<p>
The weakness of Theorem 2 is thus that it takes into account (the
uncertainty of) <em>irrelevant</em> or inessential premises. To obtain
an improved version of this theorem, a more fine-grained notion of
&lsquo;essentialness&rsquo; is necessary. In argument \(A\) in the
example above, premise \(s\) is absolutely irrelevant. Similarly,
premise \(p\) is absolutely relevant, in the sense that without this
premise, the conclusion \(p\wedge(q\vee r)\) is no longer derivable.
Finally, the premise subset \(\{q,r\}\) is &lsquo;in between&rsquo;:
together \(q\) and \(r\) are relevant (if both premises are left out,
the conclusion is no longer derivable), but each of them separately
can be left out (while keeping the conclusion derivable).</p>

<p>
The notion of essentialness is formalized as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Essential premise set.</strong> Given a valid argument
\((\Gamma,\phi)\), a set \(\Gamma' \subseteq \Gamma\) is
<em>essential</em> iff \(\Gamma - \Gamma' \not\models\phi\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Degree of essentialness.</strong> Given a valid argument
\((\Gamma,\phi)\) and a premise \(\gamma\in\Gamma\), the <em>degree of
essentialness</em> of \(\gamma\), written \(E(\gamma)\), is
\(1/|S_\gamma|\), where \(|S_\gamma|\) is the cardinality of the
smallest essential premise set that contains \(\gamma\). If \(\gamma\)
does not belong to any minimal essential premise set, then the degree
of essentialness of \(\gamma\) is 0.</p>
</div>

<p>
With these definitions, a refined version of Theorem 2 can be
established:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 4.</strong> Consider a valid argument
\((\Gamma,\phi)\). Then the uncertainty of the conclusion \(\phi\)
cannot exceed the weighted sum of the uncertainties of the premises
\(\gamma\in\Gamma\), with the degrees of essentialness as weights.
Formally: </p> 

\[U(\phi) \leq \sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}E(\gamma)U(\gamma).\]

</div>

<p>
The proof of Theorem 4 is significantly more difficult than that of
Theorem 2: Theorem 2 requires only basic probability theory, whereas
Theorem 4 is proved using methods from linear programming (Adams and
Levine 1975; Goldman and Tucker 1956). Theorem 4 subsumes Theorem 2 as
a special case: if all premises are relevant (i.e.&nbsp;have degree of
essentialness 1), then Theorem 4 yields the same upper bound as
Theorem 2. Furthermore, Theorem 4 does not take into account
irrelevant premises (i.e.&nbsp;premises with degree of essentialness
0) to compute this upper bound; hence if a premise is irrelevant for
the validity of the argument, then its uncertainty will not carry over
to the conclusion. Finally, note that since \(E(\gamma)\in [0,1]\) for
all \(\gamma\in\Gamma\), it holds that </p> 

\[\sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}E(\gamma)U(\gamma) \leq\sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}U(\gamma),\]

<p>
i.e.&nbsp;Theorem 4 yields in general a tighter upper bound than
Theorem 2. To illustrate this, consider again the argument with
premises \(p,q,r,s\) and conclusion \(p \wedge (q\vee r)\). Recall
that \(P(p)=10/11, P(q) = P(r)=9/11\) and \(P(s)=7/11\). One can
calculate the degrees of essentialness of the premises: \(E(p) = 1,
E(q) = E(r) = 1/2\) and \(E(s) = 0\). Hence Theorem 4 yields that </p>

\[\begin{align}
&amp;U(p \wedge (q\vee r))\leq \\
&amp;\quad\left(1\times \frac{1}{11}\right) + 
 \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{11}\right) + 
 \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{11}\right) + 
 \left(0 \times \frac{4}{11}\right) = \frac{3}{11},
\end{align}\]

<p>
which is a tighter upper bound for the uncertainty of \(p\wedge(q \vee
r)\) than any of the bounds obtained above via Theorem 2
(viz.&nbsp;\(9/11\) and \(5/11\)).</p>

<h3 id="FurtGene">2.3 Further Generalizations</h3>

<p>
Given the uncertainties (and degrees of essentialness) of the premises
of a valid argument, Adams&rsquo; theorems allow us to compute an
<em>upper</em> bound for the uncertainty of the conclusion. Of course
these results can also be expressed in terms of probabilities rather
than uncertainties; they then yield a <em>lower</em> bound for the
probability of the conclusion. For example, when expressed in terms of
probabilities rather than uncertainties, Theorem 4 looks as
follows:</p> 

\[P(\phi)\geq 1 - \sum_{\gamma\in\Gamma}E(\gamma)(1 - P(\gamma)).\]

<p>
Adams&rsquo; results are restricted in at least two ways:</p>

<ul class="jfy">

<li>

<p>
They only provide a <em>lower</em> bound for the probability of the
conclusion (given the probabilities of the premises). In a sense this
is the most important bound: it represents the conclusion&rsquo;s
probability in the &lsquo;worst-case scenario&rsquo;, which might be
useful information in practical applications. However, in some
applications it might also be informative to have an <em>upper</em>
bound for the conclusion&rsquo;s probability. For example, if one
knows that this probability has an upper bound of 0.4, then one might
decide to refrain from certain actions (that one would have performed
if this upper bound were (known to be) 0.9).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
They presuppose that the premises&rsquo; exact probabilities are
known. In practical applications, however, there might only be partial
information about the probability of a premise \(\gamma\): its exact
value is not known, but it <em>is</em> known to have a lower bound
\(a\) and an upper bound \(b\) (Walley 1991). In such applications it
would be useful to have a method to calculate (optimal) lower and
upper bounds for the probability of the conclusion in terms of the
upper and lower bounds of the probabilities of the premises.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Hailperin (1965, 1984, 1986, 1996) and Nilsson (1986) use methods from
linear programming to show that these two restrictions can be
overcome. Their most important result is the following:</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
<strong>Theorem 5.</strong> Consider an argument \((\Gamma,\phi)\),
with \(|\Gamma| = n\). There exist functions \(L_{\Gamma,\phi}:
\mathbb{R}^{2n} \to \mathbb{R}\) and \(U_{\Gamma,\phi}:
\mathbb{R}^{2n} \to \mathbb{R}\) such that for any probability
function \(P\), the following holds: if \(a_i \leq P(\gamma_i) \leq
b_i\) for \(1\leq i\leq n\), then:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>
\(L_{\Gamma,\phi}(a_1,\dots,a_n,b_1,\dots,b_n) \leq P(\phi) \:\leq\)
\(U_{\Gamma,\phi}(a_1,\dots,a_n,b_1,\dots,b_n)\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The bounds in item 1 are optimal, in the sense that there exist
probability functions \(P_L\) and \(P_U\) such that \(a_i \leq
P_L(\gamma_i),\) \(P_U(\gamma_i)\leq b_i\) for \(1\leq i\leq n\), and
\(L_{\Gamma,\phi}(a_1,\dots,a_n,b_1,\dots,b_n) = P_L(\phi)\) and
\(P_U(\phi) = U_{\Gamma,\phi}(a_1,\dots,a_n,b_1,\dots,b_n)\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
The functions \(L_{\Gamma,\phi}\) and \(U_{\Gamma,\phi}\) are
effectively determinable from the Boolean structure of the sentences
in \(\Gamma \cup \{\phi\}\).</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
This result can also be used to define yet another probabilistic
notion of validity, which we will call <em>Hailperin-probabilistic
validity</em> or simply <em>h-validity</em>. This notion is not
defined with respect to formulas, but rather with respect to
<em>pairs</em> consisting of a formula and a subinterval of \([0,1]\).
If \(X_i\) is the interval associated with premise \(\gamma_i\in
\Gamma\) and \(Y\) is the interval associated with the conclusion
\(\phi\), then the argument \((\Gamma,\phi)\) is said to be
<em>h</em>-valid, written \(\Gamma\models_h\phi\), if and only if 
for all probability functions \(P\):</p>

\[
\text{ if } P(\gamma_i) \in X_i \text{ for } 1\leq i\leq n, \text{ then } P(\phi)\in Y
\]

<p>
In Haenni et al. (2011) this is written as </p> 

\[\gamma_1^{X_1},\dots,\gamma_n^{X_n}|\!\!\!\approx \phi^Y\]

<p>
and called the <em>standard probabilistic semantics</em>.</p>

<p>
Nilsson&rsquo;s work on probabilistic logic (1986, 1993) has sparked a
lot of research on probabilistic reasoning in artificial intelligence
(Hansen and Jaumard 2000; chapter 2 of Haenni et al.&nbsp;2011).
However, it should be noted that although Theorem 5 states that the
functions \(L_{\Gamma,\phi}\) and \(U_{\Gamma,\phi}\) are
<em>effectively</em> determinable from the sentences in
\(\Gamma\cup\{\phi\}\), the <em>computational complexity</em> of this
problem is quite high (Georgakopoulos et al.&nbsp;1988, Kavvadias and
Papadimitriou 1990), and thus finding these functions quickly becomes
computationally unfeasible in real-world applications. Contemporary
approaches based on probabilistic argumentation systems and
probabilistic networks are better capable of handling these
computational challenges. Furthermore, probabilistic argumentation
systems are closely related to Dempster-Shafer theory (Dempster 1968;
Shafer 1976; Haenni and Lehmann 2003). However, an extended discussion
of these approaches is beyond the scope of (the current version of)
this entry; see (Haenni et al.&nbsp;2011) for a recent survey.</p>

<h2 id="BasiProbOper">3. Basic Probability Operators</h2>

<p>
In this section we will study probability logics that extend the
propositional language \(\mathcal{L}\) with rather basic probability
operators. They differ from the logics in 
 <a href="#PropProbLogi">Section 2</a> 
 in that
the logics here involve probability operators in the object language.
 <a href="#QualReprUnce">Section 3.1</a>
 discusses <em>qualitative</em> probability
operators; 
 <a href="#SumsProdProbTerm">Section 3.2</a>
 discusses <em>quantitative</em> probability operators.</p>

<h3 id="QualReprUnce">3.1 Qualitative Representations of Uncertainty</h3>

<p>
There are several applications in which qualitative theories of
probability might be useful, or even necessary. In some situations
there are no frequencies available to use as estimates for the
probabilities, or it might be practically impossible to obtain those
frequencies. Furthermore, people are often willing to <em>compare</em>
the probabilities of two statements (&lsquo;\(\phi\) is more probable
than \(\psi\)&rsquo;), without being able to assign explicit
probabilities to each of the statements <em>individually</em>
(Szolovits and Pauker 1978, Halpern and Rabin 1987). In such
situations qualitative probability logics will be useful.</p>

<p>
One of the earliest qualitative probability logics is Hamblin&rsquo;s
(1959). The language is extended with a unary operator \(\Box\), which
is to be read as &lsquo;probably&rsquo;. Hence a formula such as
\(\Box\phi\) is to be read as &lsquo;probably \(\phi\)&rsquo;. This
notion of &lsquo;probable&rsquo; can be formalized as <em>sufficiently
high (numerical) probability</em> (i.e.&nbsp;\(P(\phi)\geq t\), for
some threshold value \(1/2 &lt; t \leq 1\)), or alternatively in terms
of <em>plausibility</em>, which is a non-metrical generalization of
probability. Burgess (1969) further develops these systems, focusing
on the &lsquo;high numerical probability&rsquo;-interpretation. Both
Hamblin and Burgess introduce additional operators into their systems
(expressing, for example, metaphysical necessity and/or knowledge),
and study the interaction between the &lsquo;probably&rsquo;-operator
and these other modal operators. However, the
&lsquo;probably&rsquo;-operator already displays some interesting
features on its own (independent from any other operators). If it is
interpreted as &lsquo;sufficiently high probability&rsquo;, then it
fails to satisfy the principle \((\Box\phi\wedge\Box\psi) \to
\Box(\phi\wedge\psi)\). This means that it is not a <em>normal</em>
modal operator, and cannot be given a Kripke (relational) semantics.
Herzig and Longin (2003) and Arl&oacute; Costa (2005) provide weaker
systems of <em>neighborhood semantics</em> for such
&lsquo;probably&rsquo;-operators, while Yalcin (2010) discusses their
behavior from a more linguistically oriented perspective.</p>

<p>
Another route is taken by Segerberg (1971) and G&auml;rdenfors (1975a,
1975b), who build on earlier work by de Finetti (1937), Kraft, Pratt
and Seidenberg (1959) and Scott (1964). They introduce a
<em>binary</em> operator \(\geq\); the formula \(\phi\geq\psi\) is to
be read as &lsquo;\(\phi\) is at least as probable as \(\psi\)&rsquo;
(formally: \(P(\phi)\geq P(\psi)\)). The key idea is that one can
completely axiomatize the behavior of \(\geq\) without having to use
the &lsquo;underlying&rsquo; probabilities of the individual formulas.
It should be noted that with comparative probability (a binary
operator), one can also express some absolute probabilistic properties
(unary operators). For example, \(\phi\geq \top\) expresses that
\(\phi\) has probability 1, and \(\phi\geq\neg\phi\) expresses that
\(\phi\) has probability at least 1/2. In recent work, Delgrande and
Renne (2015) further extend the qualitative approach, by allowing the
arguments of \(\geq\) to be finite <em>sequences</em> of formulas (of
potentially different lengths). The formula \((\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n)
\geq (\psi_1,\dots,\psi_m)\) is informally to be read as &lsquo;the
sum of the probabilities of the \(\phi_i\)&rsquo;s is at least as high
as the sum of the probabilities of the \(\psi_j\)&rsquo;s&rsquo;. The
resulting logic can be axiomatized completely, and is so expressive
that it can even capture <em>quantitative</em> probabilistic logics,
to which we turn now.</p>

<h3 id="SumsProdProbTerm">3.2 Sums and Products of Probability Terms</h3>

<p>
Propositional probability logics are extensions of propositional logic
that express numerical relationships among probability terms
\(P(\varphi)\). A simple propositional probability logic adds to
propositional logic formulas of the form \(P(\varphi)\ge q\), where
\(\varphi\) is a propositional formula and \(q\) is a number; such a
formula asserts that the probability of \(\varphi\) is at least \(q\).
The semantics is formalized using models consisting a probability
function \(\mathcal{P}\) over a set \(\Omega\), whose elements are
each given a truth assignment to the atomic propositions of the
propositional logic. Thus a propositional formula is true at an
element of \(\Omega\) if the truth assignment for that element makes
the propositional formula true. The formula \(P(\varphi)\ge q\) is
true in the model if and only if the probability \(\mathcal{P}\) of
the set of elements of \(\Omega\) for which \(\varphi\) is true is at
least \(q\). See Chapter 3 of Ognjanovi&#263; et al.&nbsp;(2016) for
an overview of such a propositional probability logic.</p>

<p>
Some propositional probability logics include other types of formulas
in the object language, such as those involving sums and products of
probability terms. The appeal of involving sums can be clarified by
the additivity condition of probability functions (see 
 <a href="#ProbSema">Section 2.1</a>),
 which can be expressed as \(P(\phi \vee \psi) =
P(\phi)+P(\psi)\) whenever \(\neg (\phi \wedge \psi)\) is a tautology,
or equivalently as \(P(\phi \wedge \psi) + P(\phi \wedge \neg \psi) =
P(\phi)\). Probability logics that explicitly involve sums of
probabilities tend to more generally include linear combinations of
probability terms, such as in Fagin et al.&nbsp;(1990). Here,
propositional logic is extended with formulas of the form
\(a_1P(\phi_1) + \cdots + a_n P(\phi_n) \ge b\), where \(n\) is a
positive integer that may differ from formula to formula, and
\(a_1,\ldots,a_n\), and \(b\) are all rational numbers. Here are some
examples of what can be expressed.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
\(P(\phi) \le q\) by \(-P(\phi) \ge -q\),</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(P(\phi) &lt; q\) by \(\neg (P(\phi) \ge q)\),</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(P(\phi) = q\) by \(P(\phi)\ge q \wedge P(\phi) \le q\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(P(\phi) \ge P(\psi)\) by \(P(\phi)-P(\psi) \ge 0\).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Expressive power with and without linear
combinations:</strong> 
Although linear combinations provide a convenient way of expressing
numerous relationships among probability terms, a language without
sums of probability terms is still very powerful. Consider the
language restricted to formulas of the form \(P(\phi) \ge q\) for some
propositional formula \(\phi\) and rational \(q\). We can define</p>

\[P(\phi) \le q \text{ by } P(\neg\phi) \ge 1-q,\]

<p>
which is reasonable considering that the probability of the complement
of a proposition is equal to 1 minus the probability of the
proposition. The formulas \(P(\phi) &lt;q\) and \(P(\phi) = q\) can be
defined without linear combinations as we did above. Using this
restricted probability language, we can reason about additivity in a
less direct way. The formula </p> 

\[[P(\phi \wedge \psi) = a \wedge P(\phi \wedge \neg \psi) = b] \to P(\phi) = a+b\]

<p>
states that if the probability of \(\phi \wedge \psi\) is \(a\) and
the probability of \(\phi\wedge \neg \psi\) is \(b\), then the
probability of the disjunction of the formulas (which is equivalent to
\(\phi\)) is \(a+b\). However, while the use of linear combinations
allows us to assert that the probabilities of \(\varphi\wedge\psi\)
and \(\varphi\wedge\neg\psi\) are additive by using the formula
\(P(\varphi\wedge \psi)+P(\varphi\wedge\neg\psi) = P(\varphi)\), the
formula without linear combinations above only does so if we choose
the correct numbers \(a\) and \(b\). A formal comparison of the
expressiveness of propositional probability logic with linear
combinations and without is given in Demey and Sack (2015). While any
two models agree on all formulas with linear combinations if and only
if they agree on all formulas without (Lemma 4.1 of Demey and Sack
(2015)), it is not the case that any class of models definable by a
single formula with linear combinations can be defined by a single
formula without (Lemma 4.2 of Demey and Sack (2015)). In particular,
the class of models defined by the formula \(P(p)- P(q)\ge 0\) cannot
be defined by any single formula without the power of linear
combinations.</p>

<p>
<strong>Probabilities belonging to a given subset:</strong>
Ognjanovi&#263; and Ra&scaron;kovi&#263; (1999) extend the language of
probability logic by means of a new type of operator: \(Q_F\).
Intuitively, the formula \(Q_F\phi\) means that the probability of
\(\phi\) belongs to \(F\), for some given set \(F \subseteq [0,1]\).
This \(Q_F\)-operator cannot be defined in terms of formulas of the
form \(P(\phi) \ge a\). Ognjanovi&#263; and Ra&scaron;kovi&#263;
(1999) provide a sound and complete axiomatization of this type of
logical system. The key bridge principles, which connect the
\(Q_F\)-operator to the more standard \(P\)-operator, are the axioms
\(P(\phi) = a \to Q_F\phi\) for all \(a \in F\), as well as the
infinitary rule that specifies that from \(P(\phi) = a \to \psi\) for
all \(a \in F\), one can infer \(Q_F\phi\to\psi\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Polynomial weight formulas:</strong> Logics with polynomial
weight formulas (involving both weighted sums and products of
probability terms), can allow for formulas of the form
\(P(\phi)P(\psi)-P(\phi\wedge \psi) = 0\), that is, the probability of
both \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) is equal to the product of the
probabilities of \(\phi\) and \(\psi\). This formula captures what it
means for \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) to be <em>statistically
independent</em>. Such logics were investigated in Fagin et
al.&nbsp;(1990), but mostly with first-order logic features included,
and then again in a simpler context (without quantifiers) in
Perovi&#263; et al.&nbsp;(2008).</p>

<p>
<strong>Compactness and completeness:</strong> Compactness is a
property of a logic where a set of formulas is satisfiable if every
finite subset is satisfiable. Propositional probability logics lack
the compactness property, as every finite subset of
\(\{P(p)&gt;0\}\cup\{P(p)\leq a\,|\,a&gt;0\}\) is satisfiable, but the
entire set is not.</p>

<p>
Without compactness, a logic might be weakly complete (every valid
formula is provable in the axiomatic system), but not strongly
complete (for every set \(\Gamma\) of formulas, every logical
consequence of \(\Gamma\) is provable from \(\Gamma\) in the axiomatic
system). In Fagin et al.&nbsp;(1990), a proof system involving linear
combinations was given and the logic was shown to be both sound and
weakly complete. In Ognjanovi&#263; and Ra&scaron;kovi&#263; (1999), a
sound and strongly complete proof system is given for propositional
probability logic without linear combinations. In Heifetz and Mongin
(2001), a proof system for a variation of the logic without linear
combinations that uses a system of types to allow for iteration of
probability formulas (we will see in 
 <a href="#ModaProbLogi">Section 4</a>
 how such
iteration can be achieved using possible worlds) was given and the
logic was shown to be sound and weakly complete. They also observe
that no finitary proof system for such a logic can be strongly
complete. Ognjanovi&#263; et al.&nbsp;(2008) present some qualitative
probabilistic logics with infinitary derivation rules (which require a
countably infinite number of premises), and prove strong completeness.
Goldblatt (2010) presents a strongly complete proof system for a
related coalgebraic logic. Perovi&#263; et al.&nbsp;(2008) give a
proof system and proof of strong completeness for propositional
probability logic with polynomial weight formulas. Finally, another
strategy for obtaining strong completeness involves restricting the
range of the probability functions to a fixed, finite set of numbers;
for example, Ognjanovi&#263; et al.&nbsp;(2008) discuss a qualitative
probabilistic logic in which the range of the probability functions is
not the full real unit interval \([0,1]\), but rather the
&lsquo;discretized&rsquo; version
\(\{0,\frac{1}{n},\frac{2}{n},\dots,\frac{n-1}{n},1\}\) (for some
fixed number \(n\in\mathbb{N}\)). See Chapter 7 of Ognjanovi&#263; et
al.&nbsp;(2016) for an overview of completeness results.</p>

<h2 id="ModaProbLogi">4. Modal Probability Logics</h2>

<p>
Many probability logics are interpreted over a single, but arbitrary
probability space. <em>Modal probability logic</em> makes use of many
probability spaces, each associated with a possible world or state.
This can be viewed as a minor adjustment to the relational semantics
of modal logic: rather than associate to every possible world a set of
accessible worlds as is done in modal logic, modal probability logic
associates to every possible world a probability distribution, a
probability space, or a set of probability distributions. The language
of modal probability logic allows for embedding of probabilities
within probabilities, that is, it can for example reason about the
probability that (possibly a different) probability is \(1/2\). This
modal setting involving multiple probabilities has generally been
given a (1) <em>stochastic</em> interpretation, concerning different
probabilities over the next states a system might transition into
(Larsen and Skou 1991), and (2) a <em>subjective</em> interpretation,
concerning different probabilities that different agents may have
about a situation or each other&rsquo;s probabilities (Fagin and
Halpern 1988). Both interpretations can use exactly the same formal
framework.</p>

<p>
A basic modal probability logic adds to propositional logic formulas
of the form \(P (\phi)\ge q\), where \(q\) is typically a rational
number, and \(\phi\) is any formula of the language, possibly a
probability formula. The reading of such a formula is that the
probability of \(\phi\) is at least \(q\). This general reading of the
formula does not reflect any difference between modal probability
logic and other probability logics with the same formula; where the
difference lies is in the ability to embed probabilities in the
arguments of probability terms and in the semantics. The following
subsections provide an overview of the variations of how modal
probability logic is modeled. In one case the language is altered
slightly 
 (<a href="#IndeInte">Section 4.2</a>), and in other cases, the logic is
extended to address interactions between qualitative and quantitative
uncertainty 
 (<a href="#CombQuanQualUnce">Section 4.4</a>) or dynamics 
 (<a href="#Dyna">Section 4.5</a>).</p>

<h3 id="BasiFiniModaProbMode">4.1 Basic Finite Modal Probability Models</h3>

<p>
Formally, a <em>Basic Finite Modal Probabilistic Model</em> is a tuple
\(M=(W,\mathcal{P},V)\), where \(W\) is a finite set of possible
worlds or states, \(\mathcal{P}\) is a function associating a
distribution \(\mathcal{P}_w\) over \(W\) to each world \(w\in W\),
and \(V\) is a &lsquo;valuation function&rsquo; assigning atomic
propositions from a set \(\Phi\) to each world. The distribution is
additively extended from individual worlds to sets of worlds:
\(\mathcal{P}_w(S) = \sum_{s\in S}\mathcal{P}_w(s)\). The first two
components of a basic modal probabilistic model are effectively the
same as a Kripke frame whose relation is decorated with numbers
(probability values). Such a structure has different names, such as a
directed graph with labelled edges in mathematics, or a probabilistic
transition system in computer science. The valuation function, as in a
Kripke model, allows us to assign properties to the worlds.</p>

<p>
The semantics for formulas are given on pairs \((M,w)\), where \(M\)
is a model and \(w\) is an element of the model. A formula \(P(\phi)
\ge q\) is true at a pair \((M,w)\), written \((M,w)\models P(\phi)\ge
q\), if and only if \(\mathcal{P}_w(\{w'\mid (M,w')\models \phi\}) \ge
q\).</p>

<h3 id="IndeInte">4.2 Indexing and Interpretations</h3>

<p>
The first generalization, which is most common in applications of
modal probabilistic logic, is to allow the distributions to be indexed
by two sets rather than one. The first set is the set \(W\) of worlds
(the base set of the model), but the other is an index set \(A\) often
to be taken as a set of actions, agents, or players of a game.
Formally, \(\mathcal{P}\) associates a distribution
\(\mathcal{P}_{a,w}\) over \(W\) for each \(w\in W\) and \(a\in A\).
For the language, rather than involving formulas of the form
\(P(\phi)\ge q\), we have \(P_a(\phi)\ge q\), and \((M,w)\models
P_a(\phi)\ge q\) if and only if \(\mathcal{P}_{a,w}(\{w'\mid
(M,w')\models \phi\}) \ge q\).</p>

<p>
<strong>Example:</strong> Suppose we have an index set \(A = \{a,
b\}\), and a set \(\Phi = \{p,q\}\) of atomic propositions. Consider
\((W,\mathcal{P},V)\), where</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
\(W = \{w,x,y,z\}\)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\mathcal{P}_{a,w}\) and \(\mathcal{P}_{a,x}\) map \(w\) to \(1/2\),
\(x\) to \(1/2\), \(y\) to \(0\), and \(z\) to \(0\).</p>

<p>
\(\mathcal{P}_{a,y}\) and \(\mathcal{P}_{a,z}\) map \(y\) to \(1/3\),
\(z\) to \(2/3\), \(w\) to \(0\), and \(x\) to \(0\).</p>

<p>
\(\mathcal{P}_{b,w}\) and \(\mathcal{P}_{b,y}\) map \(w\) to \(1/2\),
\(y\) to \(1/2\), \(x\) to \(0\), and \(z\) to \(0\).</p>

<p>
\(\mathcal{P}_{b,x}\) and \(\mathcal{P}_{b,z}\) map \(x\) to \(1/4\),
\(z\) to \(3/4\), \(w\) to \(0\), and \(y\) to \(0\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(V(p) = \{w,x\}\)</p>

<p>
\(V(q) = \{w,y\}\).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
We depict this example with the following diagram. Inside each circle
is a labeling of the truth of each proposition letter for the world
whose name is labelled right outside the circle. The arrows indicate
the probabilities. For example, an arrow from world \(x\) to world
\(z\) labeled by \((b,3/4)\) indicates that from \(x\), the probably
of \(z\) under label \(b\) is \(3/4\). Probabilities of 0 are not
labelled.</p>

<img src="figure1.svg" alt="Four circles each with a possible state of p,q and probability arrows between them" width="50%" />

<span class="figlabel">Figure</span></p>
</div>

<p>
<strong>Stochastic Interpretation:</strong> Consider the elements
\(a\) and \(b\) of \(A\) to be actions, for example, pressing buttons
on a machine. In this case, pressing a button does not have a certain
outcome. For instance, if the machine is in state \(x\), there is a
\(1/2\) probability it will remain in the same state after pressing
\(a\), but a \(1/4\) probability of remaining in the same state after
pressing \(b\). That is, </p> 

\[(M,x) \models P_a(p\wedge \neg q) = 1/2 \wedge P_b(p\wedge \neg q) = 1/4.\]

<p>
A significant feature of modal logics in general (and this includes
modal probabilistic logic) is the ability to support <em>higher-order
reasoning</em>, that is, the reasoning about probabilities of
probabilities. The importance of higher-order probabilities is clear
from the role they play in, for example, <em>Miller&rsquo;s
principle</em>, which states that \(P_1(\phi\mid P_2(\phi) = b) = b\).
Here, \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) are probability functions, which can have
various interpretations, such as the probabilities of two agents,
logical and statistical probability, or the probabilities of one agent
at different moments in time (Miller 1966; Lewis 1980; van Fraassen
1984; Halpern 1991). Higher-order probability also occurs for instance
in the <em>Judy Benjamin Problem</em> (van Fraassen 1981a) where one
conditionalizes on probabilistic information. Whether one agrees with
the principles proposed in the literature on higher-order
probabilities or not, the ability to represent them forces one to
investigate the principles governing them.</p>

<p>
To illustrate higher-order reasoning more concretely, we return to our
example and see that at \(x\), there is a \(1/2\) probability that
after pressing \(a\), there is a \(1/2\) probability that after
pressing \(b\), it will be the case that \(\neg p\) is true, that is,
</p> 

\[(M,x)\models P_a(P_b(\neg p)= 1/2)=1/2.\]

<p>
<strong>Subjective Interpretation:</strong> Suppose the elements \(a\)
and \(b\) of \(A\) are players of a game. \(p\) and \(\neg p\) are
strategies for player \(a\) and \(q\) and \(\neg q\) are both
strategies for player \(b\). In the model, each player is certain of
her own strategy; for instance at \(x\), player \(a\) is certain that
she will play \(p\) and player \(b\) is certain that she will play
\(\neg q\), that is </p> 

\[(M,x)\models P_a(p) = 1 \wedge P_b(\neg q) = 1.\]

<p>
But the players randomize over their opponents. For instance at \(x\),
the probability that \(b\) has for \(a\)&rsquo;s probability of \(\neg
q\) being \(1/2\) is \(1/4\), that is </p> 

\[(M,x)\models P_b(P_a(q)=1/2)=1/4.\]

<h3 id="ProbSpac">4.3 Probability Spaces</h3>

<p>
Probabilities are generally defined as measures in a measure space. A
measure space is a set \(\Omega\) (the sample space) together with a
\(\sigma\)-algebra (also called \(\sigma\)-field) \(\mathcal{A}\) over
\(\Omega\), which is a non-empty set of subsets of \(\Omega\) such
that \(A\in \mathcal{A}\) implies that \(\Omega-A\in \mathcal{A}\),
and \(A_i\in \mathcal{A}\) for all natural numbers \(i\), implies that
\(\bigcup_i A_i\in \mathcal{A}\). A measure is a function \(\mu\)
defined on the \(\sigma\)-algebra \(\mathcal{A}\), such that \(\mu(A)
\ge 0\) for every set \(A \in\mathcal{A}\) and \(\mu(\bigcup_i A_i) =
\sum_i\mu(A_i)\) whenever \(A_i\cap A_j = \emptyset\) for each
\(i,j\).</p>

<p>
The effect of the \(\sigma\)-algebra is to restrict the domain so that
not every subset of \(\Omega\) need have a probability. This is
crucial for some probabilities to be defined on uncountably infinite
sets; for example, a uniform distribution over a unit interval cannot
be defined on all subsets of the interval while also maintaining the
countable additivity condition for probability measures.</p>

<p>
The same basic language as was used for the basic finite probability
logic need not change, but the semantics is slightly different: for
every state \(w\in W\), the component \(\mathcal{P}_w\) of a modal
probabilistic model is replaced by an entire probability space
\((\Omega_w,\mathcal{A}_w,\mu_w)\), such that \(\Omega_w\subseteq W\)
and \(\mathcal{A}_w\) is a \(\sigma\)-algebra over \(\Omega_w\). The
reason we may want entire spaces to differ from one world to another
is to reflect uncertainty about what probability space is the right
one. For the semantics of probability formulas, \((M,w)\models P(\phi)
\ge q\) if and only if \(\mu_w(\{w'\mid (M,w')\models \phi\})\ge q\).
Such a definition is not well defined in the event that \(\{w'\mid
(M,w')\models \phi\}\not\in \mathcal{A}_w\). Thus constraints are
often placed on the models to ensure that such sets are always in the
\(\sigma\)-algebras.</p>

<h3 id="CombQuanQualUnce">4.4 Combining Quantitative and Qualitative Uncertainty</h3>

<p>
Although probabilities reflect quantitative uncertainty at one level,
there can also be qualitative uncertainty about probabilities. We
might want to have qualitative and quantitative uncertainty because we
may be so uncertain about some situations that we do not want to
assign numbers to the probabilities of their events, while there are
other situations where we do have a sense of the probabilities of
their events; and these situations can interact.</p>

<p>
There are many situations in which we might not want to assign
numerical values to uncertainties. One example is where a computer
selects a bit 0 or 1, and we know nothing about how this bit is
selected. Results of coin flips, on the other hand, are often used
examples of where we would assign probabilities to individual
outcomes.</p>

<p>
An example of how these might interact is where the result of the bit
determines whether a fair coin or a weighted coin (say, heads with
probability \(2/3\)) be used for a coin flip. Thus there is
qualitative uncertainty as to whether the action of flipping a coin
yields heads with probability \(1/2\) or \(2/3\).</p>

<p>
One way to formalize the interaction between probability and
qualitative uncertainty is by adding another relation to the model and
a modal operator to the language as is done in Fagin and Halpern
(1988, 1994). Formally, we add to a basic finite probability model a
relation \(R\subseteq W^2\). Then we add to the language a modal
operator \(\Box\), such that \((M,w)\models \Box\phi\) if and only if
\((M,w')\models \phi\) whenever \(w R w'\).</p>

<p>
Consider the following example:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
\(W = \{(0,H),(0,T),(1,H),(1,T)\}\),</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(\Phi = \{h,t\}\) is the set of atomic propositions,</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(R = W^2\),</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(P\) associates with \((0,H)\) and \((0,T)\) the distribution mapping
\((0,H)\) and \((0,T)\) each to \(1/2\), and associates with \((1,H)\)
and \((1,T)\) the distribution mapping \((1,H)\) to \(2/3\) and
\((1,T)\) to \(1/3\),</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(V\) maps \(h\) to the set \(\{(0,H),(1,H)\}\) and \(t\) to the set
\(\{(0,T),(1,T)\}\).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Then the following formula is true at \((0,H)\): \(\neg \Box h \wedge
(\neg \Box P(h)= 1/2) \wedge (\Diamond P(h) = 1/2)\). This can be read
as <em>it is not known that \(h\) is true, and it is not known that
the probability of \(h\) is \(1/2\), but it is possible that the
probability of \(h\) is \(1/2\).</em></p>

<h3 id="Dyna">4.5 Dynamics</h3>

<p>
We have discussed two views of modal probability logic. One is
temporal or stochastic, where the probability distribution associated
with each state determines the likelihood of transitioning into other
states; another is concerned with subjective perspectives of agents,
who may reason about probabilities of other agents. A stochastic
system is dynamic in that it represents probabilities of different
transitions, and this can be conveyed by the modal probabilistic
models themselves. But from a subjective view, the modal probabilistic
models are static: the probabilities are concerned with what currently
is the case. Although static in their interpretation, the modal
probabilistic setting can be put in a dynamic context.</p>

<p>
Dynamics in a modal probabilistic setting is generally concerned with
simultaneous changes to probabilities in potentially all possible
worlds. Intuitively, such a change may be caused by new information
that invokes a probabilistic revision at each possible world. The
dynamics of subjective probabilities is often modeled using
conditional probabilities, such as in Kooi (2003), Baltag and Smets
(2008), and van Benthem et al.&nbsp;(2009). The probability of \(E\)
conditional on \(F\), written \(P(E\mid F)\), is \(P(E\cap F)/P(F)\).
When updating by a set \(F\), a probability distribution \(P\) is
replaced by the probability distribution \(P'\), such that \(P'(E)=
P(E \mid F)\), so long as \(P(F)\neq 0\). Let us assume for the
remainder of this dynamics subsection that every relevant set
considered has positive probability.</p>

<p>
Using a probability logic with linear combinations, we can abbreviate
the conditional probability \(P(\phi\mid \psi)\ge q\) by \(P(\phi
\wedge \psi) - qP(\psi)\ge 0\). In a modal setting, an operator
\([!\psi]\) can be added to the language, such that \(M,w\models
[!\psi]\phi\) if and only if \(M',w\models \phi\), where \(M'\) is the
model obtained from \(M\) by revising the probabilities of each world
by \(\psi\). Note that \([!\psi](P(\phi)\ge q)\) differs from
\(P(\phi\mid \psi)\ge q\), in that in \([!\psi](P(\phi)\ge q)\), the
interpretation of probability terms inside \(\phi\) are affected by
the revision by \(\psi\), whereas in \(P(\phi\mid \psi)\ge q\), they
are not, which is why \(P(\phi\mid \psi)\ge q\) nicely unfolds into
another probability formula. However, \([!\psi]\phi\) does unfold too,
but in more steps: </p> 

\[[!\psi](P(\phi)\ge q) \leftrightarrow (\psi\to P([!\psi]\phi \mid \psi) \ge q).\]

<h2 id="FirsOrdeProbLogi">5. First-order Probability Logic</h2>

<p>
In this section we will discuss first-order probability logics. As was
explained in 
 <a href="#CombLogiProbTheo">Section 1</a>
 of this entry, there are many ways in
which a logic can have probabilistic features. The models of the logic
can have probabilistic aspects, the notion of consequence can have a
probabilistic flavor, or the language of the logic can contain
probabilistic operators. In this section we will focus on those
logical operators that have a first-order flavor. The first-order
flavor is what distinguishes these operators from the probabilistic
modal operators of the previous section.</p>

<p>
Consider the following example from Bacchus (1990):</p>

<p class="center">
More than 75% of all birds fly.</p>

<p>
There is a straightforward probabilistic interpretation of this
sentence, namely when one <em>randomly selects</em> a bird, then the
probability that the selected bird flies is more than 3/4. First-order
probabilistic operators are needed to express these sort of
statements.</p>

<p>
There is another type of sentence, such as the following sentence
discussed in Halpern (1990):</p>

<p class="center">
The probability that Tweety flies is greater than \(0.9\).</p>

<p>
This sentence considers the probability that Tweety (a particular
bird) can fly. These two types of sentences are addressed by two
different types of semantics, where the former involves probabilities
over a domain, while the latter involves probabilities over a set of
possible worlds that is separate from the domain.</p>

<h3 id="ExamFirsOrdeProbLogi">5.1 An Example of a First-order Probability Logic</h3>

<p>
In this subsection we will have a closer look at a particular
first-order probability logic, whose language is as simple as
possible, in order to focus on the probabilistic quantifiers. The
language is very much like the language of classical first-order
logic, but rather than the familiar universal and existential
quantifier, the language contains a probabilistic quantifier.</p>

<p>
The language is built on a set of of <em>individual variables</em>
(denoted by \(x, y, z, x_1, x_2, \ldots\)), a set of <em>function
symbols</em> (denoted by \(f, g, h, f_1, \ldots\)) where an arity is
associated with each symbol (nullary function symbols are also called
<em>individual constants</em>), and a set of <em>predicate
letters</em> (denoted by \( R, P_1, \ldots\)) where an arity is
associated with each symbol. The language contains two kinds of
syntactical objects, namely <em>terms</em> and <em>formulas</em>. The
terms are defined inductively as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
Every individual variable \(x\) is a term.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
Every function symbol \(f\) of arity \(n\) followed by an \(n\)-tuple
of terms \((t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) is a term.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Given this definition of terms, the formulas are defined inductively
as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
Every predicate letter \(R\) of arity \(n\) followed by an \(n\)-tuple
of terms \((t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) is a formula.</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If \(\phi\) is a formula, then so is \(\neg \phi\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) are formulas, then so is \((\phi \wedge
\psi)\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
If \(\phi\) is a formula and \(q\) is a rational number in the
interval \([0,1]\), then so is \(Px (\phi) \geq q\).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Formulas of the form \(Px (\phi) \geq q\) should be read as:
&ldquo;the probability of selecting an \(x\) such that \(x\) satisfies
\(\phi\) is at least \(q\)&rdquo;. The formula \(Px(\phi) \leq q\) is
an abbreviation of \(Px(\neg \phi) \geq 1-q\) and \(Px(\phi)=q\) is an
abbreviation of \(Px(\phi) \geq q \wedge Px(\phi) \leq q\). Every free
occurrence of \(x\) in \(\phi\) is bound by the operator.</p>

<p>
This language is interpreted on very simple first-order models, which
are triples \(M=(D,I,P)\), where the <em>domain of discourse</em>
\(D\) is a finite nonempty set of objects, the <em>interpretation</em>
\(I\) associates an \(n\)-ary function on \(D\) with every \(n\)-ary
function symbol occurring in the language, and an \(n\)-ary relation
on \(D\) with every \(n\)-ary predicate letter. \(P\) is a
<em>probability function</em> that assigns a probability \(P(d)\) to
every element \(d\) in \(D\) such that \(\sum_{d \in D} P(d)=1\).</p>

<p>
In order to interpret formulas containing free variables one also
needs an <em>assignment</em> \(g\) which assigns an element of \(D\)
to every variable. The interpretation \([\![t]\!]_{M,g}\) of a term
\(t\) given a model \(M=(D,I,P)\) and an assignment \(g\) is defined
inductively as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
\([\![ x ]\!]_{M,g}=g(x)\)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\([\![ f (t_1,\ldots,t_n)]\!]_{M,g}= I(f) ([\![t_1]\!], \ldots,
[\![t_n]\!])\)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
Truth is defined as a relation \(\models\) between models with
assignments and formulas:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
\(M,g \models R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) iff \(([\![t_1]\!], \ldots,
[\![t_n]\!]) \in I(R)\)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(M,g \models \neg \phi\) iff \(M,g \not \models \phi\)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(M,g \models (\phi \wedge \psi)\) iff \(M,g \models \phi\) and \(M,g
\models \psi\)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(M,g \models Px(\phi) \geq q\) iff \(\sum_{d :M,g[x \mapsto d]
\models \phi} P(d) \geq q\)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
As an example, consider a model of a vase containing nine marbles:
five are black and four are white. Let us assume that \(P\) assigns a
probability of 1/9 to each marble, which captures the idea that one is
equally likely to pick any marble. Suppose the language contains a
unary predicate \(B\) whose interpretation is the set of black
marbles. The sentence \(Px(B(x)) = 5/9\) is true in this model
regardless of the assignment.</p>

<p>
The logic that we just presented is too simple to capture many forms
of reasoning about probabilities. We will discuss three extensions
here.</p>

<h4 id="QuanOverThanOneVari">5.1.1 Quantifying over More than One Variable</h4>

<p>
First of all one would like to reason about cases where more than one
object is selected from the domain. Consider for example the
probability of first picking a black marble, putting it back, and then
picking a white marble from the vase. This probability is 5/9
\(\times\) 4/9 = 20/81, but we cannot express this in the language
above. For this we need one operator that deals with multiple
variables simultaneously, written as \(Px_1,\ldots x_n (\phi) \geq
q\). The semantics for such operators will then have to provide a
probability measure on subsets of \(D^n\). The simplest way to do this
is by simply taking the product of the probability function \(P\) on
\(D\), which can be taken as an extension of \(P\) to tuples, where
\(P(d_1,\ldots d_n)= P(d_1) \times \cdots \times P(d_n)\), which
yields the following semantics:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
\(M,g \models Px_1\ldots x_n (\phi) \geq q\) iff
\(\sum_{(d_1,\ldots,d_n) :M,g[x_1 \mapsto d_1, \ldots, x_n \mapsto
d_n] \models \phi} P(d_1,\ldots,d_n) \geq q\)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
This approach is taken by Bacchus (1990) and Halpern (1990),
corresponding to the idea that selections are independent and with
replacements. With these semantics the example above can be formalized
as \(Px,y (B(x) \wedge \neg B(y))= 20/81\). There are also more
general approaches to extending the measure on the domain to tuples
from the domain such as by Hoover (1978) and Keisler (1985).</p>

<h4 id="CondProb">5.1.2 Conditional Probability</h4>

<p>
When one considers the initial example that more than 75% of all birds
fly, one finds that this cannot be adequately captured in a model
where the domain contains objects that are not birds. These objects
should not matter to what one wishes to express, but the probability
quantifiers, quantify over the whole domain. In order to restrict
quantification one must add conditional probability operators \(Px
(\phi | \psi) \geq q\) with the following semantics:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
\(M,g \models Px (\phi | \psi) \geq q\) iff if there is a \(d \in D\)
such that \(M,g[x \mapsto d] \models \psi\) then</p> 

\[
\frac{\sum_{d :  M,g[x\mapsto d] \models \phi \wedge \psi} P(d)}
  {\sum_{d: M,g [x \mapsto d] \models \psi} P(d)} \geq q.
\]

</li>
</ul>

<p>
With these operators, the formula \(Px(F(x) \mid B(x)) &gt; 3/4\)
expresses that more than 75% of all birds fly.</p>

<h4 id="ProbTerm">5.1.3 Probabilities as Terms</h4>

<p>
When one wants to compare the probability of different events, say of
selecting a black ball and selecting a white ball, it may be more
convenient to consider probabilities to be terms in their own right.
That is, an expression \(Px(\phi)\) is interpreted as referring to
some rational number. Then one can extend the language with
arithmetical operations such as addition and multiplication, and with
operators such as equality and inequalities to compare probability
terms. One can then say that one is twice as likely to select a black
ball compared to a white ball as \(Px(B(x))=2 \times Px (W(x))\). Such
an extension requires that the language contains two separate classes
of terms: one for probabilities, numbers and the results of
arithmetical operations on such terms, and one for the domain of
discourse which the probabilistic operators quantify over. We will not
present such a language and semantics in detail here. One can find
such a system in Bacchus (1990).</p>

<h3 id="PossWorlFirsOrdeProbLogi">5.2 Possible World First-order Probability Logic</h3>

<p>
In this subsection, we consider a first-order probability logic with a
possible-world semantics (which we abbreviate FOPL). The language of
FOPL is similar to the example we gave in
 <a href="#ExamFirsOrdeProbLogi">Section 5.1</a>
 related to that of
Bacchus, except here we have full quantifier formulas of the form
\((\forall x)\phi\) for any formula \(\phi\), and instead of
probability formulas of the form \(Px(\phi)\ge q\), we have
probability formulas of the form \(P(\phi)\ge q\) (similar to the
probability formulas in propositional probability logic).</p>

<p>
The models of FOPL are of the form \(M = (W,D,I,P)\), where \(W\) is a
set of <em>possible worlds</em>, \(D\) is a <em>domain of
discourse</em>, \(I\) is a localized interpretation function mapping
every \(w\in W\) to a interpretation function \(I(w)\) that associates
to every function and predicate symbol, a function or predicate of
appropriate arity, and \(P\) is a probability function that assign a
probability \(P(w)\) to every \(w\) in \(W\).</p>

<p>
Similarly to the simple example before, we involve an assignment
function \(g\) mapping each variable to an element of the domain
\(D\). To interpret terms, for every model \(M\), world \(w\in W\),
and assignment function \(g\), we map each term \(t\) to domain
elements as follows:</p> 

<ul>
<li>\([\![ x ]\!]_{M,w,g} =g(x)\)</li>
<li>\([\![ f (t_1,\ldots,t_n)]\!]_{M,w,g} = I(w)(f) ([\![t_1]\!], \ldots,  [\![t_n]\!])\)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Truth is defined according to a relation \(\models\) between pointed
models (models with designated worlds) with assignments and formulas
as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>
\(M,w,g \models R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) iff \(([\![t_1]\!], \ldots,
[\![t_n]\!]) \in I(w)(R)\)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(M,w,g \models \neg \phi\) iff \(M,w,g \not \models \phi\)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(M,w,g \models (\phi \wedge \psi)\) iff \(M,w,g \models \phi\) and
\(M,w,g \models \psi\)</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(M,w,g\models (\forall x)\varphi\) iff \(M,w,g[x/d]\models \varphi\)
for all \(d\in D\), where \(g[x/d]\) is the same as \(g\) except that
it maps \(x\) to \(d\).</p></li>

<li>

<p>
\(M,w,g\models P(\varphi)\ge q\) iff \(P(\{w'\mid (M,w',g)\models
\varphi\})\ge q\).</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
As an example, consider a model where there are two possible vases: 4
white marbles and 4 black marbles were put in both possible vases. But
then another marble, called , was placed in the vase, but in one
possible vase, was white, and in the other it was black. Thus in the
end, there are two possible vases: one with 5 black marbles and 4
white marbles, and the other with 4 black marbles and 5 white marbles.
Suppose \(P\) assigns \(1/2\) probability to the two possible vases.
Then \(P(B(\mathsf{last})) = 1/2\) is true for this variable
assignment, and if any other variable assignment were chosen, the
formula \((\exists x) P(B(x)) = 1/2\) would still be true.</p>

<h3 id="Meta">5.3 Metalogic</h3>

<p>
Generally it is hard to provide proof systems for first-order
probability logics, because the validity problem for these logics is
generally undecidable. It is even not the case, as it is the case in
classical first-order logic, that if an inference is valid, then one
can find out in finite time (see Abadi and Halpern (1994)).</p>

<p>
Nonetheless there are many results for first-order probability logic.
For instance, Hoover (1978) and Keisler (1985) study completeness
results. Bacchus (1990) and Halpern (1990) also provide complete
axiomatizations as well as combinations of first-order probability
logics and possible-world first-order probability logics respectively.
In Ognjanovi&#263; and Ra&scaron;kovi&#263; (2000), an infinitary
complete axiomatization is given for a more general version of the
possible-world first-order probability logic presented here.</p>

<h2>Life of Hui Shi</h2>

<p>
Early sources present us with three distinct traditions about Hui Shi,
which no one source fully ties together. In one set of tales, he is a
statesman and political persuader of varying rank and efficacy. The
more reliable parts of the Han anthology <em>Intrigues of the Warring
States</em> (<em>Zhanguoce</em>) depict him as a second-tier
government
 official.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup>
 By contrast, Book 18 of <em>The Annals of L&uuml; Buwei</em> (ca. 235
B.C.) portrays him as a major political figure, traveling with a large
retinue and serving as chief minister to King Hui of Wei (370&ndash;319
B.C.), who respects him so much he titles him &ldquo;Uncle to the
King&rdquo; (<em>Annals,</em> 18.6). Though conceding Hui Shi&rsquo;s
cleverness, this part of the <em>Annals</em> vilifies him. One story
(18.5) credits him with composing a widely praised law code only to
have a rival dismiss it as excessively elaborate and impracticable.
Another chapter (18.6) cites him as a model of intellectual arrogance
and condemns him for incompetence, blaming him for the decline of Wei
and claiming that his &ldquo;stupid&rdquo; policies were
&ldquo;laughed at by the whole world.&rdquo; Depictions of him in the
<em>Zhuangzi</em> (Book 17) and <em>Hanfeizi</em> (Book 9) are more
neutral, however, and the <em>Hanfeizi</em> and a later book of the
<em>Annals</em> (21) portray him as a brilliant political persuader.
Indeed, even in passages framed to belittle him, bits of rhetorical
brilliance shine through:</p>

<blockquote>
King Hui of Wei said to Hui Shi, &ldquo;To govern a state in previous
ages, one needed to be a worthy. Now I am really not the equal of you,
sir. I wish to hand over the state to you.&rdquo; Hui Shi refused. The
King again pressed his request, saying, &ldquo;If I do not keep the
state here for myself, but hand it over to a worthy, the
people&rsquo;s greedy and contentious mindset will stop. This is why I
want you to obey me.&rdquo; Hui Shi said, &ldquo;If it is like what
your majesty says, then I cannot obey. You are the lord of ten
thousand chariots, yet your offering the state to another can bring
this about. Now for me, a commoner, to have the chance to possess a
state of ten thousand chariots yet <em>refuse</em> it, this would stop
the greedy and contentious mindset even more.&rdquo; (18.6/461)
</blockquote>

<p>
A second set of tales, confined to the <em>Zhuangzi,</em> famously
depict him as a friend of and intellectual straight man for the
carefree nonconformist
 <a href="../zhuangzi/index.html">Zhuang Zhou</a>.
 One story about the friendship ties Hui Shi to his political role
(Book 17) and two to his role as a disputer (Books 5 and 24), but none
link all three roles. A separate mention of Hui Shi alone (Book 2)
also ties him to disputation. No passage gives us any specific
information about his philosophical views or his skill as a
politician. Indeed, far from being an incisive disputer or a shrewd
statesman, the Hui Shi of the <em>Zhuangzi</em> is almost totally
colorless, a dull, pedestrian foil against which to highlight
Zhuangzi&rsquo;s wit and insight. The sharpest argument he gets to
give is in their famous exchange about the happy fish, where Zhuangzi
bests him by switching between senses of the word &lsquo;whence&rsquo;
(<em>an</em>):</p>

<blockquote>
Zhuangzi and Hui Shi were strolling on the bridge above the Hao river.
Zhuangzi said, &ldquo;Out swim the minnows so free and easy, this is
the happiness of fish.&rdquo; Hui Shi said, &ldquo;You are not a fish.
Whence do you know the happiness of fish?&rdquo; Zhuangzi said,
&ldquo;You are not me. Whence do you know I don&rsquo;t know the
happiness of fish?&rdquo; Hui Shi said, &ldquo;Granted that I am not
you, I don&rsquo;t know about you. Then granted that you are not a
fish, the case for your not knowing the happiness of fish is
complete.&rdquo; Zhuangzi said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s trace back to the
root of the issue. When you said, &lsquo;<em>Whence</em> do you know
the fish are happy?&rsquo;, you asked me already knowing I knew it. I
knew it from up above the Hao.&rdquo; (cf. Graham 1981: 123)
</blockquote>

<p>
Virtually nothing about the Hui Shi persona portrayed in the
<em>Zhuangzi</em> hooks up with his reputation as a talented statesman
or disputer. Indeed, the text gives us little reason to believe that
the friendship between Zhuangzi and Hui Shi is anything more than a
narrative device. The tradition of stories about the pair might
suggest that the two historical figures were acquainted, but little
more.</p>

<p>
The third tradition about Hui Shi is that he was a disputer who
propounded sophistries and paradoxes. Among the pre-Han texts that
have come down to us, the basis for this tradition is surprisingly
thin: the <em>Xunzi</em> passages discussed in connection with Deng Xi
above, Xunzi&rsquo;s further remark that Hui Shi was &ldquo;obscured
by expressions and did not know reality&rdquo; (<em>shi,</em> also
&ldquo;stuff&rdquo; or &ldquo;things&rdquo;) (21.4), and a pair of
passages in <em>Zhuangzi</em> (Books 2 and 5) that link him to the
theme of &ldquo;hard and white,&rdquo; though reporting nothing of his
thought. Indeed, since the <em>Han History</em> credits him with only
a single scroll of writings, now lost, &ldquo;Under Heaven&rdquo;
provides the only clear evidence that he was not just a skilled
rhetorician but a thinker of significance. Unfortunately, this text is
probably from the mid 2nd century B.C., 150 years or more after his
death, so we cannot assume it is historically reliable. It could
merely present the latest stage in the evolution of the legend of Hui
Shi, sharpest of the disputers. </p>

<p>
If by chance both the statesman and disputer traditions about Hui Shi
are true, or largely true, then he was a gifted polymath with a lively
intellect, though he apparently wrote next to nothing. (&ldquo;Under
Heaven&rdquo; says he had five cartloads of books, but these could
have been his library, not his writings.) He may have been a
quick-witted rhetorician, a judicious statesman, a thinker who
addressed fundamental ontological questions, and perhaps even a
proto-scientist: </p>

<blockquote>
In the south there was a strange man named Huang Liao, who asked why
the sky does not fall nor the earth cave in and the reasons for the
wind, rain, and thunder. Hui Shi responded without hesitation,
answered without thinking, and explained all the myriad things. He
explained without rest, going on without stopping, still thought it
too little, and then added some marvel to it. (cf. Graham 1989: 77)
</blockquote>

<p>
Unfortunately, since we lack any record of the details of Hui
Shi&rsquo;s arguments or his accounts of the myriad things, this
potentially fascinating chapter in Chinese intellectual history seems
closed to us forever.</p>

<h2>Some Formal Theories in the Literature</h2>

<p>
Here we briefly present some existing formal theories of facts.
(Vocabulary and results presented in
 <a href="index-2.html#FormTheoFact">section 2</a>
 are presupposed here.)</p>

<h3>Suszko 1968</h3>

<p>
Suszko (1968) presents an axiomatic modal theory of situations which
aims at partly systematizing the ontological views of the
<em>Tractatus</em>, formulated in a language containing propositional
quantifiers (which he sharply distinguishes from objectual
quantifiers) and a binary identity operator &lsquo;=&rsquo;.
Situations are not treated as objects. The appropriate mode of
expression for talking &ldquo;about&rdquo; situations is to use
locutions of type &lsquo;it is a situation that \(p\)&rsquo;, which
Suszko defines as follows &lsquo;it is a situation that \(p = (p =
p)\)&rsquo;. In order to discuss the theory in the light of what
precedes, we shall nevertheless assume that situations are objects,
designated by sentences.</p>

<p>
In Suszko&rsquo;s theory, every sentence designates a situation. Thus
situations have negations, and any finitely many situations can be
combined conjunctively and disjunctively. We shall take the facts to
be the possible situations (Suszko defines a non-rigid notion of fact,
but we will use the one just defined).</p>

<p>
Suszko defines a world as a fact such that for every situation \(p\),
it necessitates \(p\) or it necessitates the negation of \(p\). All
the situations which are necessitated by a world are possible, i.e.,
facts, and every fact is necessitated by some world. We take the
domain of a world to be just the set of all situations it
necessitates.</p>

<p>
In the theory, <em>Modal Criterion</em> holds, as well as <em>No
Twins</em> and <em>Plenitude</em>. As we saw, situations have
negations, and any finitely many situations can be combined
conjunctively and disjunctively. Thus there is an operation of
negation on facts, and an operation of conjunction and one of
disjunction as well, but restricted to finite collections of facts.
This is certainly an accident due to the lack of expressive power of
the language, and presumably unrestricted operations should be
admitted in suitable extensions of that language.</p>

<p>
The notion of a state of affairs is taken as a primitive. States of
affairs are facts, they are neither necessary nor impossible, and the
negation of a state of affairs is not a state of affairs. Suszko
endorses the view that in every possible world, there is at least one
obtaining state of affairs, and that every possible world is identical
to a conjunction of state of affairs and of negations of state of
affairs.</p>

<p>
Suszko has an axiom which says that the set of all states of affairs
is <em>quasi-independent</em> (our terminology): any finite set of
states of affairs is independent in the sense of
 <a href="index-2.html#Inde">section 2.3</a>.
 But the set of all states of affairs itself is not independent, since
in every world there is an obtaining state of affairs. (It then
follows that the states of affairs are infinitely many.) A theorem
states that every situation is a disjunction of worlds, namely the
disjunction of all worlds in which it exists. So the set \(F\) of all
facts is generated by the set of all states of affairs via
Booleanization. Suszko&rsquo;s theory is thus a variant of
\(\mathrm{t}_4\), and is pretty close to \(\mathrm{T}_4\): Suszko has
quasi-independence where \(\mathrm{T}_4\) has independence
<em>tout-court</em>.</p>

<p>
(Suszko discusses the inner structure of facts. He holds that states
of affairs are complexes containing properties and objects, raises
various questions but does not propose any definitive principles.
Notice that Suszko&rsquo;s attempt at systematizing
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s ideas on facts departs from Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
thought on the matter. As we saw, the latter denies that facts combine
by means of Boolean operations, and holds that the set of all facts is
independent <em>tout court</em>, not just quasi-independent. Finally,
see Wolniewicz 1982 for a study partly stemming from Suszko&rsquo;s
paper and Wolniewicz 1983 for a more general study, each of which
employs an algebraic framework.)</p>

<h3>Van Fraassen 1969</h3>

<p>
Van Fraassen 1969 contains a non-modal theory of facts which he uses to provide a
semantic analysis of tautological entailments (cf. Anderson &amp;
Belnap 1975). Here we shall present a modal theory based on it,
focusing on facts themselves and their relations to propositions,
which departs from the original theory but which retains the core of
Van Fraassen&rsquo;s ideas and is of interest in itself.</p>

<p>
With each world \(w\) we associate a domain \(D_w\) of individuals,
and we assume that there is a collection of relations. We also assume
that there is an operation, the <em>complex-builder</em>, which takes
any \(n\)-ary relation \(R\) and any \(n\) members \(a_1 , \ldots
,a_n\) from any domain of individuals to yield a fact [\(R\); \(a_1 ,
\ldots ,a_n\)]. The facts obtained that way are called
<em>complexes</em>. We take for granted that each \(n\)-ary relation
has a <em>dual</em>, namely that for each \(n\)-ary relation \(R\),
there is another \(n\)-ary relation \(S\) such that given any
individuals \(a_1 , \ldots ,a_n\) existing in some world, the
existence-set of [\(R\); \(a_1 , \ldots ,a_n\)] is the complement of
the existence-set of [\(S\); \(a_1 , \ldots ,a_n\)]. We assume that
each relation has a unique dual. Notice that the dual of the dual of a
relation is the relation itself. Thus there is an operation of
negation defined <em>on the set of complexes</em>. We finally take it
that there is an operation \(^\textbf{c}\) of conjunction defined on
the set of all facts, and that the set of all complexes generates the
set of all facts via conjunction.</p>

<p>
Given all these assumptions, it is possible to use facts to formulate
a theory of truth for certain kinds of propositions. Instead of
working directly with propositions, we shall work with an artificial
interpreted formal language whose sentences express all the
propositions in question, and only them. The language is a first-order
language with individual constants, whose basic predicates express
relations and whose variables range over individuals, which verifies
the following two conditions: (i) every relation is expressed by some
basic predicate of the language, and (ii) every individual (taken from
any world) is designated by some constant of the language.</p>

<p>
We let the <em>product</em> of some given sets of facts \(G,
H,\ldots\) be the set of all conjunctions \(\{x, y, \ldots
\}^\textbf{c}\) for \(x\in G, y\in H,\ldots\) The set \(V_w (A)\) of
<em>verifiers</em> of sentence <i>A</i> at world \(w\), and the set
\(F_w (A)\) of <em>falsifiers</em> of \(A\) at world \(w\) are sets of
facts are defined as follows:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>

<p>
For \(F\) a \(n\)-place predicate and \(n_1 , \ldots ,n_n\)
constants,</p>

<div class="indent">

<p>
\(V_w (F(n_1 , \ldots ,n_n)) = \{[R\); \(a_1 , \ldots ,a_n]\}\) and
<br/>
\(F_w (F(n_1 , \ldots ,n_n)) = \{[S\); \(a_1 , \ldots ,a_n]\}\),</p>
</div>

<p>
where \(R\) is the relation expressed by \(F, S\) is the dual of
\(R\), and each \(n_i\) designates the corresponding \(a_i\);</p></li>

<li>\(V_w (\neg A) = F_w (A)\), and \(F_w (\neg A) = T_w (A)\);</li>

<li>\(V_w (A \amp B) =\) the product of \(V_w (A)\) and \(V_w (B)\),
and \(F_w (A \amp B) =\) the union of \(F_w (A)\) and \(F_w
(B)\);</li>

<li> \(V_w (\forall x\phi(x)) =\) the product of all the sets \(V_w
(\phi(n))\) for \(n\) a name of some member of \(D_w\), and \(F_w
(\forall x\phi(x)) =\) the union of all the sets \(F_w (\phi(n))\) for
\(n\) a name of some member of \(D_w\).</li>
</ol>

<p>
It is then easy to verify that for every sentence \(A\) of our
language, \(A\) is true in world \(w\) iff some verifier of \(A\)
relative to \(w\) exists in \(w\), and \(A\) is false in world \(w\)
iff some falsifier of \(A\) relative to \(w\) exists in \(w\).</p>

<h3>Fine 1982</h3>

<p>
Fine (1982) distinguishes between two conceptions of facts, the
<em>propositional</em> and the <em>worldly</em>. On the propositional
view, facts are derivative upon propositions, the identity of a fact
depends on the identity of a given proposition. On that view, every
fact is obtained by applying a fact-forming operation to a given
proposition. On the worldly conception, facts are not derivative upon
propositions. Fine takes it that these two conceptions correspond to
two genuine categories of objects, and calls the first <em>truths</em>
and the second <em>circumstances</em>. He also distinguishes between
two other, orthogonal conceptions of facts, <em>objectualism</em> and
<em>anti-objectualism</em>. Objectualism is the view that facts have
an internal structure, that they are composed by objects in a certain
way, and anti-objectualism the opposite view.</p>

<p>
Fine presents three theories of facts framed in the language we have
been using here: two anti-objectualist theories, one for truths
(F(A)-Cond) and one for circumstances (C-Cond), and a theory of truths
under the objectualist view (F-Cond). F-Cond has niceties which make
it difficult to present here. F(A)-Cond is just \(\mathrm{W}4 +\)
<em>Modal Criterion</em>, and C-Cond is \(\mathrm{B}2 + \mathrm{B}4 +
\mathrm{W}1 +\) <em>Modal Criterion</em>. The first theory thus admits
of all Boolean operations on facts, and the second admits
conjunction.</p>

<p>
Theory F(A)-Cond is supplemented by the principle according to which
there is a 1-1 correspondence C between the facts and the propositions
which can be true, such that for any such proposition \(p\) and any
world, \(p\) is true at that world iff the corresponding fact exists
in that world, which entails P1. No such principle is introduced to
extend C-Cond, but in the informal part of the paper Fine suggests
that P2 is the right candidate.</p>

<h3>Zalta 1991</h3>

<p>
Zalta 1991 contains an axiomatic theory of situations, worlds and
states of affairs, in the framework of Zalta&rsquo;s theory of
abstract objects. Zalta defines <em>situations</em> as abstract
objects which encode certain properties, namely properties expressed
by predicates of type &lsquo;being such that \(p\)&rsquo;, for
&lsquo;\(p\)&rsquo; a sentence, and only such properties. A situation
is <em>part</em> of another one iff every property the first encodes
is encoded by the second. <em>States of affairs</em> are what is
expressed by sentences. Zalta define <em>worlds</em> as situations of
a certain kind: a world is a situation \(w\) which is possibly such
that it encodes being such that \(p\) iff it is the case that \(p\),
for any \(p\). We may define the domain \(F_w\) of a world \(w\) as
the set of all situations which are part of that world. On the theory,
every possible situation belongs to the domain of some world.</p>

<p>
There are two interpretations of the theory. We may take facts to be
possible states of affairs, or alternatively, we may take facts to be
possible situations and understand &lsquo;state of affairs&rsquo; as
&lsquo;proposition&rsquo;.</p>

<p>
Let us assume the first view. The theory then licences fact-negation,
and fact-conjunction and fact-disjunction restricted to finite sets of
facts. These restrictions arise from the limited expressive power of
the language in which the theory is formulated, it seems that on a
natural extension of the theory, the restriction should vanish, in
which case the theory would be a variant of \(\mathrm{t}_4\). <em>No
Twins</em> holds, but not <em>Modal Criterion</em>.</p>

<p>
Let assume now the second reading of the theory. There is then a
theorem which says that each world belongs to its own domain and to it
only, so W2 holds. B4 holds, <em>Modal Criterion</em> fails, and there
is no negation or disjunction operation on facts. There is an
operation of conjunction on facts, restricted to finite collections of
facts, due to limitations in expressive power. Again, a natural
extension of the theory should drop the restriction, in which case the
theory would be a variant of \(\mathrm{t}_3\). Principle P1 of
truthmaking trivially holds: given any proposition \(p\) which can be
true, the (possible) situation which encodes just the property of
being such that \(p\) is part of a world (in Zalta&rsquo;s system,
this means that the world encodes the property of being such that
\(p)\) iff the situation is part of that world.</p>

<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Kant&rsquo;s Transcendental Idealism</a></h2>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-1" id="note-1">1.</a>
 Ever since the publication of the <em>Critique</em>, this claim, the
so-called &ldquo;doctrine of noumenal affection&rdquo;, has been
especially controversial since it apparently involves predicating a
category (cause-effect) of things in themselves. This controversy is
discussed below, in
 <a href="index-2.html#ProbThinThem">section 3.4</a>.</p>
 
<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2" id="note-2">2.</a>
 In the <em>Critique of Practical Reason</em>, transcendental idealism
is invoked to secure the possibility of the highest good (Ak.
5:134&ndash;136); in the <em>Critique of Judgment,</em> it is invoked
to prove the possibility of a reflective judgment of taste (Ak.
5:338&ndash;351) and the possibility of a reflective judgment of
purposiveness (Ak. 5:405&ndash;415).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3" id="note-3">3.</a>
 In the B Edition, Kant adds a footnote here, pointing out that
&ldquo;formal&rdquo; idealism might be a better term for this view, to
distinguish it from &ldquo;material&rdquo; idealism (which he
elsewhere calls &ldquo;empirical&rdquo; idealism).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4" id="note-4">4.</a>
 See especially B274, but also B71. Berkeley is also cited as a
dogmatic idealist in the <em>Prolegomena</em> (Ak. 4:293, 374) and
Refl. 6311 (Ak. 18:610) and the metaphysics lectures (Ak. 28:680,
29:928). Beiser (2002: 79&ndash;80) argues that in the A Edition Kant
has Leibniz in mind as the representative dogmatic idealist.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5" id="note-5">5.</a>
 The empirical thing in itself corresponds roughly to Lockean primary
qualities, while the empirical appearance corresponds roughly to its
secondary qualities. For Kant&rsquo;s own comparison of his idealism to that
Lockean distinction see <em>Prolegomena</em> (Ak. 4:289); Allais
(2007) is a sophisticated discussion of Kant&rsquo;s secondary quality
analogy.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6" id="note-6">6.</a>
 E.g. magnetic matter (A226/B273) and &ldquo;lamellae&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Discovery&rdquo;, Ak. 8:205), light particles posited by
Newton. See Langton 1998: 186&ndash;204.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7" id="note-7">7.</a>
 Beiser 1987 and 2002 are particularly illuminating on the influence
of the subjectivist reading on the development of post-Kantian German
philosophy. See also Vaihinger 1892: vol. 2, 35&ndash;55.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8" id="note-8">8.</a>
 A translation is published in Sassen 2000: 54&ndash;58. The same
volume also contains a translation of Garve&rsquo;s much longer original
draft; the originals can be found in Karl Vorl&auml;nder&rsquo;s edition of
the <em>Prolegomena</em> (Hamburg: Meiner, 1969: 167&ndash;74). In a
letter to Kant, Garve claims that the published review is mainly
Feder&rsquo;s fault (Ak. 10: 331). However, as Beiser (2002: 88) points out,
nearly two thirds of the published review comes from the Garve&rsquo;s
original text.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9" id="note-9">9.</a>
 As Beiser (2002) points out, Jacobi, whose influential objections to
Kant&rsquo;s idealism are discussed in
 <a href="index-2.html#ProbThinThem">section 3.4</a>,
 cites the following passages in defense of the phenomenalist
interpretation: A370, A372&ndash;3, A374&ndash;75n, A378,
A379&ndash;80, A36&ndash;37, A37n, A491, A101, A125, A126&ndash;7.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10" id="note-10">10.</a>
 Discussions of Kant&rsquo;s alleged phenomenalism have been somewhat
distorted in Anglophone literature by the emphasis on the semantic
version of phenomenalism made popular by (among others) Russell and
Carnap according to which sentences about objects are equivalent in
meaning to complex sentences about mental states. It is implausible
that Kant intended such a semantic reduction. Cf. Bennett 1966:
136&ndash;7 and Allison 2004: 38. Van Cleve (1999: 8&ndash;12)
requires more minimally that facts about objects be
&ldquo;derivable&rdquo; from facts about mental states, but if
&ldquo;derivable&rdquo; here means something like &ldquo;derivable
using logic and definitions&rdquo; it is still too strong for
Kant.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11" id="note-11">11.</a>
 Kant also points out that that, in contrast to Berkeley&rsquo;s empiricist
theory of ideas, space and time constitute necessary and <em>a
priori</em> forms for any experience of objects (for minds like ours).
For more on this point, see the supplementary article: Kant&rsquo;s Attempts
to Distance Himself from Berkeley.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12" id="note-12">12.</a>
 The relation of Kant to Berkeley has been extensively discussed in
the secondary literature. Scholars who agree with Kant that his
idealism is fundamentally different than Berkeley&rsquo;s include Wilson
(1971), Allison (1973), Walker (1985), Beiser (2002: 82&ndash;103),
and Emundts (2008). The similarity of Kant to Berkeley is argued for
by Turbayne (1955, 1969). </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13" id="note-13">13.</a>
 Beiser (2002: 100&ndash;102) convincingly argues that Kant&rsquo;s
interpretation of Berkeley fits his later work <em>Siris</em> rather
well (the only Berkeleyan work Kant cites by name) rather than his
earlier <em>Principles</em> and <em>Dialogues</em>, on which our
modern reading of Berkeley is largely based. But this does not affect
my point in the body of the text: if Kant is ignorant of, or simply
not talking about, Berkeley&rsquo;s <em>Principles</em> and
<em>Dialogues</em> view, his horror at being identified with the good
Bishop is not strong evidence against the phenomenalist reading.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14" id="note-14">14.</a>
 The idea that the B Edition represents a substantive change in view
from the A edition seems to have been originated by Schopenhauer in
1818 in the first volume of <em>Die Welt als Wille und
Vorstellung</em> (see Schopenhauer 1938: vol. II, 514&ndash;517,
526&ndash;527); since then, it has been shared by many, including
Heidegger (1929) and Guyer (1987).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15" id="note-15">15.</a>
 Kant also refers to his own position as &ldquo;formal&rdquo; idealism
in the <em>Prolegomena</em> (Ak. 4:337). Elsewhere, he refers to it as
&ldquo;critical&rdquo; idealism (<em>Prolegomena</em> 4:294, 375;
<em>On a discovery</em> 8:210).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16" id="note-16">16.</a>
 But that definition of transcendental idealism, as we saw earlier,
was one of the motivations for the phenomenalist reading in the first
place. Kant would have been aware that his early readers picked up on
the phenomenalist implications of this passage, for Jacobi cites it as
evidence that Kant is a phenomenalist. If Kant wants to prevent the
phenomenalist (mis)interpretation popularized by Feder and Garve, why
does he add a footnote to, but not otherwise amend, a definition with
apparently phenomenalist implications? Some phenomenalist readers
might take this as evidence for their reading.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17" id="note-17">17.</a>
 In the &ldquo;Aesthetic&rdquo;: &ldquo;what we call outer objects are
nothing other than mere representations of our sensibility&rdquo;
(A30/B45). See also A189/B235 and A191/B236.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18" id="note-18">18.</a>
 See note 33 for more on the idea of a shift in view from the A to the
B Edition.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19" id="note-19">19.</a>
 This is appropriate, since Kant seems to have placed a great deal of
importance on the Refutation, judging by the number of Reflections
about it: 5653&ndash;4, 6311&ndash;12, 6313&ndash;16, 5709, 6317, 6319
and 6323. For critical discussion, see Guyer (1983, 1987:
279&ndash;332); Vogel (1993); Hanna (2000); Dicker (2008); Chignell
(2010) and Dicker&rsquo;s reply, (2011).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20" id="note-20">20.</a>
 I am thus departing from the interpretation of Guyer (1983, 1987),
according to which Kant&rsquo;s ultimate intention in the Refutation, only
fulfilled in later Reflections, is to prove the existence of objects
ontologically independent of the self (&ldquo;things in
themselves&rdquo;).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21" id="note-21">21.</a>
 There is, however, a lengthy scholarly controversy over whether the
&ldquo;Refutation of Idealism&rdquo; is compatible with the A Edition;
see Vaihinger (1884) for a survey of the earlier literature and Guyer
(1987) for a more recent argument that, with the
&ldquo;Refutation&rdquo;, Kant fundamentally alters his earlier
position.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22" id="note-22">22.</a>
 See, though, Kant&rsquo;s long comment on the &ldquo;Refutation&rdquo; in
the B Preface (Bxxxix&ndash;Bxli), where he remarks:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the representation of something persisting in experience is not the
same as the persisting representation. (Bxli) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
So there may be room for an identity phenomenalist reading of the
&ldquo;Refutation&rdquo; after all.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-23" id="note-23">23.</a>
 I am only claiming that phenomenalism is <em>prima facie</em>
compatible with the &ldquo;Refutation&rdquo;; on this point, I am in
agreement with Guyer (1983: 337&ndash;338). Whether or not the
argument of the Refutation must ultimately be interpreted in a way
that demands realism, I will not attempt to address here.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-24" id="note-24">24.</a>
 In fact, a broadly phenomenalist analysis of objects is even
compatible with Kant&rsquo;s final note to the argument:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Here it had to be proved that inner experience in general is possible
only through outer experience in general. Whether this or that
putative experience is not mere imagination must be ascertained
according to its particular determinations and through its coherence
with the criteria of all actual experience. (B278&ndash;9) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Kant points to the distinction between &ldquo;mere imagination&rdquo;
of objects (dreams, hallucinations, etc.) and veridical perception and
claims that his argument has established that self-consciousness
requires the latter, although self-consciousness only requires
veridical perception &ldquo;in general&rdquo;. I take this to mean
that a self-conscious subject can sometimes simply be dreaming, but it
is impossible that a self-conscious subject only <em>ever</em> dreams
or hallucinates. This is compatible with a phenomenalist reading
because (as discussed in greater detail in
 <a href="index-2.html#KantPhen">section 3</a>)
 the phenomenalist can distinguish between veridical perception and
dreaming. The key point is that the phenomenalist must analyze
veridical perception in terms of the internal unity and coherence
among experiences, rather than their matching some mind-independent
object. For instance, in line with the interpretation sketched above,
the phenomenalist can read Kant as claiming that self-consciousness
requires that enough of one&rsquo;s experiences cohere to constitute a
unified experience. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-25" id="note-25">25.</a>
 Van Cleve (1999) refers to the &ldquo;act-object
(&ldquo;ing&rdquo;-&ldquo;ed&rdquo;) ambiguity of words like
&ldquo;representation&rdquo; (which is also possessed by words like
Vorstellung in German)&rdquo; (1999: 7). However, I&rsquo;m not sure
my linguistic intuitions (about either German or English) agree with
Van Cleve&rsquo;s here.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-26" id="note-26">26.</a>
 Sellars (1968: ch.2, 1976). See also Cummins (1968) and Aquila (1979,
1983: ch. 4). Descartes discusses the formal and objective reality of
ideas in Meditation three.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-27" id="note-27">27.</a>
 Passages that support the grounding of the existence of objects in
experience include A245/B276, B279, A490&ndash;1/B518&ndash;9,
A520/B492-A521/B493, A494/B522. Aquila (1983) develops a detailed
textual case that appearances exist in being experienced. For a
non-phenomenalist reading of these passages see Allison (2004: 40 and
41).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-28" id="note-28">28.</a>
 This interpretation of experience bears some resemblance to that
given in Cohen (1871), without Cohen&rsquo;s Neo-Kantian reading of the
thing in itself as the unapproachable limit of scientific
knowledge.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-29" id="note-29">29.</a>
 Conjunction is usually defined for sentences, but it can be easily
generalized to all representations that have correctness conditions:
if <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> are representations in some mode
<em>m</em>, the representation <em>A</em>&amp;<em>B</em> is the
representation in mode <em>m</em> (if there is one) that is correct
just in case <em>A</em> is correct and <em>B</em> is correct.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-30" id="note-30">30.</a>
 Allais may have in mind the fact that perceptions are themselves
appearances, and thus exist in virtue of the very universal experience
they ground. If so, her objection is a form of the &ldquo;problem of
affection&rdquo; discussed in section 3.4.3, and treated more fully in
Stang (2015).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-31" id="note-31">31.</a>
 It is not universally granted that Kant accepts the Affection claim;
Vaihinger (1892) lists Fichte, Beck, Maimon, and Hermann Cohen, among
others, as &ldquo;Kantianer&rdquo; who denied noumenal affection. In
the third chapter of his 1924, Erich Adickes assembles an impressive
array of textual evidence that Kant did accept Affection. See
especially A190/B235, A387, A494/B522, Ak. 4:289, 4:314, 4:318, 4:451
and 8:215.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-32" id="note-32">32.</a>
 Van Cleve points out that <em>p</em> and <em>It is unknowable whether
p</em> are logically consistent but asserting both might constitute a
pragmatic self-contradiction (1999: 135). But, as Hogan (2009a: 61n3)
points out, Kant also claims that it is &ldquo;indubitably
certain&rdquo; (A48) that things in themselves are not in space and
time. Ameriks (2003: 29&ndash;30) argues that Existence and Affection
constitute a pre-theoretic belief that Kant never has reason to deny
(although he does successively give up his pre-theoretic belief that
these beings are spatial, etc.), to which Hogan correctly counters
that Non-spatiality is surely not such a pre-theoretic assumption
(2009a: 50&ndash;51) and that, even if <em>Affection</em> is a
pre-theoretic belief that is never <em>defeated</em> by the critical
epistemology, it is <em>undermined</em> by the discovery that none of
the objects we experience are things in themselves (2009b: 503).</p>

 Langton (1998) defends such an interpretation, on which we lack
knowledge specifically of the <em>intrinsic</em> properties of things
in themselves.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-34" id="note-34">34.</a>
 Cf. B166&ndash;7, A88/B120, A254/B309. In the remainder of this
passage, Kant refers to the practical use of the thought of categories
without intuitions; this is a reference to the crucial role that
things in themselves play in his theory of freedom. See <em>Critique
of Practical Reason</em>, Ak. 5:43, 54&ndash;55.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-35" id="note-35">35.</a>
 It is sometimes misleadingly referred to as the problem of double
affection. Double affection is the doctrine that accepts both horns of
Jacobi&rsquo;s problem, famously defended by Adickes (1924, 1929). Jacobi&rsquo;s
problem only arises on the first horn: empirical affection. Van Cleve
(1999: 165&ndash;6) rejects the doctrine of empirical affection for
this very reason. Stang (2015) attempts to solve the problem. For more
on the doctrine of double affection see Drexler (1904), Adickes
(1929), Kemp Smith (1962, especially Appendix C), Weldon (1958),
Vaihinger (1892: vol. 2, 35&ndash;55, esp. 53&ndash;55), and Gram
(1975).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-36" id="note-36">36.</a>
 I do not want to suggest that everyone read the <em>Critique</em>
this way until the twentieth century. Already in the nineteenth
century, the Neo-Kantian movement developed a non-phenomenalist
interpretation of Kant, but that lies outside the scope of this
survey. See especially Cohen (1871/1885, 1907); as well as K&ouml;hnke
(1986), Patton (2005), and Richardson (2003).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-37" id="note-37">37.</a>
 I have in mind mainly Bird (1962), Prauss (1974), Allison (1973,
1976, 1983, 2004). Cf. Collins (1999), Dryer (1966: ch. 11); Matthews
(1969). Earlier &ldquo;dual aspect&rdquo; readings include Paton
(1936: vol. 1, 61), and Beck (1960).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-38" id="note-38">38.</a>
 See also A35/B51, B69, B306, A360. The Dual Aspect view is more or
less directly stated by Kant in the <em>Opus Postumum</em> (Ak.
22:43&ndash;44). However, since some scholars think that Kant revised
fundamental aspects of his Critical theory in that later work (the
idea of a &ldquo;post-Critical&rdquo; Kant), this is not as decisive
evidence as it would otherwise be.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-39" id="note-39">39.</a>
 There is thus a natural connection between the epistemological
interpretation of transcendental idealism and Putnam-style
&ldquo;internal realism&rdquo;, a point noted by Allison (2004: 454
note 17). The relation between transcendental idealism and
contemporary anti-realism is explored in Allais (2003) and Van Cleve
(1999: ch. 12).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-40" id="note-40">40.</a>
 For Kant&rsquo;s conception of an &ldquo;intuitive intellect&rdquo;, see
the <em>Critique of Judgment</em>, Ak. 5:406. He discusses the related
(though not necessarily identical) notion of a non-sensible intuition
at A249, A256/B311&ndash;2, B307, and A286/B342.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-41" id="note-41">41.</a>
 Strawson (1966: 20&ndash;21) interprets discursivity more minimally
as the claim that we have singular representations of objects which we
subsume under general concepts; Strawson thinks Kant went wrong in
assuming that this &ldquo;logical&rdquo; dualism must be explained by
a &ldquo;dualism&rdquo; of mental faculties: a receptive faculty of
intuitions, and a spontaneous faculty of concepts. Allison (2004:
12&ndash;13) responds to Strawson on these points.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-42" id="note-42">42.</a>
 We have different epistemic conditions for different kinds of
objects, e.g. space is an epistemic condition for outer objects, but
not for inner intuitions. So the definition should really be:
<em>E</em> is an epistemic conditions of objects on kind <em>K</em>
iff necessarily in cognizing objects of kind <em>K</em> we represent
them using <em>E</em>. However, in the body of the text I suppress
this complication.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-43" id="note-43">43.</a>
 &ldquo;The pure concepts of the understanding are free from this
limitation and extend to objects of intuition in general, whether the
later be similar to our own or not, as long as it is sensible and not
intellectual&rdquo; (B148).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-44" id="note-44">44.</a>
 Allison also reconstructs Kant&rsquo;s argument for the non-spatiality of
things in themselves in the &ldquo;Transcendental Aesthetic&rdquo;
(Allison 2004: 128&ndash;132), specifically, how Kant can respond to
the famous &ldquo;neglected alternative&rdquo; problem. However, that
argument is independent of Allison&rsquo;s larger interpretation of
transcendental idealism, so I do not discuss it here; a &ldquo;two
object&rdquo; interpreter could, in principle, embrace that other
argument.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-45" id="note-45">45.</a>
 For the triviality objection see Guyer (1987: 336); Langton (1998:
8&ndash;12); Aquila (1983: 90); Van Cleve (1999: 4). For Allison&rsquo;s own
reply to the triviality charge, see his (2004: 18&ndash;19). Allison&rsquo;s
response is that the non-cognizability of things in themselves follows
from a distinction, but the distinction is not trivial. This is
confused, however. Distinctions do not have consequences; claims that
distinctions do or not obtain have consequences. And, arguably, the
statement that the appearance/thing in itself distinction obtains is a
matter of definition (on Allison&rsquo;s reading). In the body of the text I
have attempted to reply on Allison&rsquo;s behalf to the triviality
objection.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-46" id="note-46">46.</a>
 See also Robinson (1994) and Guyer (1987: 337&ndash;338). Van Cleve
(1999: 148&ndash;149) presents the argument in greater detail and
Allison responds in 2004: 42&ndash;45. As I understand Allison&rsquo;s
response to Van Cleve it is the same point as above: we should not
assume that there is a way objects independently of an epistemic
perspective on t hem.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-47" id="note-47">47.</a>
 E.g., Kant&rsquo;s claim that our noumenal character causes our empirical
character (A546/B574, A551/B579, A556/B584, A557/B585), and in
<em>Groundwork</em> III that &ldquo;the world of understanding
contains the ground of the world of sense&rdquo; (Ak. 4:453).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-48" id="note-48">48.</a>
 Langton&rsquo;s explanation of how Humility is compatible with</p>

<p class="indent">
(<em>Affection</em>) Things in themselves causally affect us.</p>

<p>
requires her to slightly amend the &ldquo;translation&rdquo; rules
from above, though, because otherwise <em>Affection</em> would entail
that &ldquo;affecting us&rdquo; is an intrinsic property of
substances, which she would deny. Langton&rsquo;s reconstruction of Kant&rsquo;s
argument for Humility rests on the premise that the causal powers of
substances by which they affect us do not supervene on their intrinsic
properties. Consequently, <em>affect us</em> is not an intrinsic
property of substances. Nonetheless, Langton can reinterpret
<em>Affection</em> as:</p>

<p class="indent">
(<em>Affection</em>*) Substances causally affect us in virtue of their
powers, which do not supervene on their intrinsic properties.</p>

<p>
consistent with the spirit of her interpretation.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-49" id="note-49">49.</a>
 This requires a slight tweak in her definition of things in
themselves and appearances:</p>

<p class="indent">
(<em>Things in themselves</em>*) Things in themselves are substances
with intrinsic properties, and extrinsic properties that supervene on
intrinsic properties.</p>

<p class="indent">
(<em>Appearances</em>*) Appearances are non-supervenient extrinsic
properties of substances.</p>

<p>
However, this is consistent with Langton&rsquo;s overall reading because we
can now say: our ignorance of things in themselves is ignorance of
their intrinsic properties and the extrinsic properties that supervene
on them. Since causal powers (on Langton&rsquo;s reading) are
non-supervenient extrinsic properties, we retain the result that
things in themselves do not affect us.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-50" id="note-50">50.</a>
 In other words, the &ldquo;pure&rdquo; concept of substance, or the
&ldquo;unschematized&rdquo; category of substance, is the concept of a
being in which other beings inhere, but itself inheres in nothing
further. See A147/B186, A242/B300, Refl. 5295 (Ak. 18:145).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-51" id="note-51">51.</a>
 Langton quotes Kant&rsquo;s marginal comments on Baumgarten: &ldquo;A real
subject is a substance. An accident can be a logical subject&rdquo;
(Ak. 18:67).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-52" id="note-52">52.</a>
 Langton does cite Kant&rsquo;s claim at A525/B553 that matter is not
&ldquo;an absolute subject&rdquo;. But Kant there contrasts being
&ldquo;an absolute subject&rdquo; with being &ldquo;a sensible abiding
picture&rdquo; which is &ldquo;nothing but intuition&rdquo;. Kant&rsquo;s
point appears to be the familiar one (constantly reiterated in the
&ldquo;Antinomies&rdquo; section) that matter exists at least partly
in virtue of being experienced and does not have an existence
&ldquo;grounded in itself&rdquo; (A491&ndash;494/B519&ndash;52). This
does not require him to assert that bodies are predicated of in things
in themselves. Langton appears to concede this point (Langton 2011:
60) about A525/B553, but this is potentially more damaging to her case
than she admits.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-53" id="note-53">53.</a>
 Kant does sometimes refer to things in themselves as the
&ldquo;substratum&rdquo; of appearances, but he more often uses
grounding and causal terminology.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-54" id="note-54">54.</a>
 Against the hypothesis of identity, one might point to the Kant&rsquo;s
explicit denial that &ldquo;the supersensible substratum of matter is
divided according to its monads in the same way as I divide matter
itself&rdquo; (<em>On a discovery</em>, Ak. 8:209n). But this only
entails that the mereological structure of things in themselves does
not mirror that of appearances (matter); it does not follow that there
is no one-to-one correspondence between the latter and the former. Cf.
Ameriks (1982: 10); Adams (1997:); and Van Cleve (1999:
149&ndash;156).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-55" id="note-55">55.</a>
 A whole that is not a part of any greater whole and whose parts stand
in real connection.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-56" id="note-56">56.</a>
 This is one possible interpretation of Kant&rsquo;s solution to the First
Antinomy: the totality of objects in time and space (the empirical
world) is not &ldquo;given&rdquo; as an object. See
A497&ndash;507/B525&ndash;535.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-57" id="note-57">57.</a>
 Beiser (2002: 22) argues that the &ldquo;one world or two?&rdquo;
debate is sterile. Allison (2004: 459 note 19) argues that his own
&ldquo;methodological&rdquo; interpretation of Kant&rsquo;s idealism is not
committed to a the Identity view; I discuss this point below. </p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-58" id="note-58">58.</a>
 Allison (2004: 459, note 19); see also Allison 1987: 168. Other
writers who have questioned the cogency of the &ldquo;one object or
multiple objects?&rdquo; debate include Beiser, who calls the debate
&ldquo;sterile&rdquo; (2002: 22), and Walker (2010), who thinks that
the question of &ldquo;how many worlds?&rdquo; has no answer because
it is based on the metaphor of a &ldquo;world&rdquo; of objects. Adams
(1997) appears to accept that the question is meaningful, but argues
that Kant must be agnostic on whether appearances in general are
numerically identical to things in themselves.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-59" id="note-59">59.</a>
 Against the contentfulness of these identity claims, it might be
argued that in his discussion of &ldquo;Identity and difference&rdquo;
in the &ldquo;Amphiboly&rdquo; section, Kant distinguishes two
principles of identity: the principle of the identity of
indiscernibles, which is said to apply to <em>noumena</em>, and the
principle of spatiotemporal individuation (two qualitatively identical
things can be in different locations simultaneously), which applies to
phenomena (A263&ndash;4/B319&ndash;20). Neither principle applies
across categories; neither principle applies to putative identities
between appearances and things in themselves. However, it is not clear
whether these principles are supposed to supply the <em>content</em>
of identity claims, or merely the conditions that <em>warrant</em>
such claims. Thus, it is unclear whether this means that such identity
claims are devoid of content or that we merely lack warrant for
them.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-60" id="note-60">60.</a>
 That the &ldquo;identity/non-identity&rdquo; dispute is not really
crucial to Langton&rsquo;s interpretation is suggested by the very terms in
which she formulates her view:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the labels &ldquo;phenomena&rdquo; and &ldquo;noumena&rdquo; seem to
label different entities, but really they label different classes of
properties of the same set of entities. (Langton 1998:13)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
But assuming (as I think we must) that classes of properties are
<em>entities</em> then &ldquo;phenomena&rdquo; and
&ldquo;noumena&rdquo; are labels for different entities&mdash;namely,
different classes of properties! Langton, of course, means that the
difference between phenomena (appearances) and noumena (things in
themselves) is not as sharp as it is on the phenomenalist view:
phenomena are merely properties of noumena. Thus, while they are
numerically distinct, there is not much metaphysical
&ldquo;room&rdquo; between them. This is important, because, even
though this is technically a non-identity or &ldquo;two object&rdquo;
view, it has a much easier time with the traditional problems that
afflict phenomenalist readings: how to square Humility about things in
themselves with the assumption that they exist and are non-spatial?
What really separates Langton from phenomenalist readings is not the
question of whether phenomena and noumena are numerically identical
but how much the traditional problems for phenomenalism apply to her
view.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-61" id="note-61">61.</a>
 Notably, Adickes (1924). Some readers might balk at the inclusion of
Adickes among the Identity readers; see, however, Adickes (1924: 20,
27). This point is also made by Robinson (1994: 416 note 22). Also,
Westphal (1968).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-62" id="note-62">62.</a>
 Allison may also have in mind the idea that identity statements
themselves can only be evaluated relative to a standpoint; it is
unclear from his brief remarks whether this is his intent. Cf. Van
Cleve (1999: 150) where he criticizes the idea that identity could be
standpoint-relative in this way.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-63" id="note-63">63.</a>
 Adams (1997) argues for a related point: that there are no grounds
that would warrant Kant in asserting either Identity or non-Identity
in non-moral contexts, so he is not committed to either. Adams does
not go as far as denying that the question makes sense in non-moral
contexts.</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-64" id="note-64">64.</a>
 For more on intellectual intuition in the <em>Critique</em> see Bxl,
B145, B150, A 252/B 308&ndash;9, and A 256/B 311&ndash;12.A279/B335,
B308 and Kant&rsquo;s marginal notes in his own copy (<em>E</em> CXXX and
CXXXI at A248; Ak. 23:36; <em>E</em> CXXXVII at A253, Ak. 23:49). The
<em>locus classicus</em> for intellectual intuition and the closely
notion of intuitive intellect [<em>intuitiver Verstand</em>] is the
<em>Critique of Judgment</em>, &sect;76&ndash;77 (Ak.
5:401&ndash;410). For critical commentary see Gram (1981), Westphal
(2000), and F&ouml;rster (2012: 140&ndash;143).</p>

<p>

 <a href="supplement1.html#ref-65" id="note-65">65.</a>
 With one qualification: Berkeley, of course, does believe that God is
&ldquo;transcendentally external&rdquo; (in Kant&rsquo;s sense) but
would deny, I take it, that God is an object for us, for we do not
have an idea of God. We do have a <em>notion</em> of God, according to
Berkeley, but Berkeley&rsquo;s doctrine of non-sensory notions lies
far outside the scope of this article.</p>

<p>

 <a href="supplement1.html#ref-66" id="note-66">66.</a>
 I find it independently implausible that at 4:289 by &ldquo;objects
outside us&rdquo; Kant means things in themselves. Kant often
distinguishes between two forms of idealism: dogmatic idealism (which
denies the existence of outer objects) and problematic idealism (which
is agnostic about the existence of outer objects). Immediately after
the definition of idealism at 4:289 Kant reminds us that we cannot
know things in themselves. So if he mean &ldquo;objects outside
us&rdquo; to refer to things in themselves, he would just have
committed himself to problematic idealism, but Kant consistently
argues that transcendental idealism is the only way to <em>avoid</em>
problematic idealism. The issue of idealism, for Kant, is an issue
about objects in space.</p>

<p>

 <a href="supplement1.html#ref-67" id="note-67">67.</a>
 This point is, I think, missed by the discussion of B70&ndash;1 in
Allison 2004: 25.</p>

<p>

 <a href="supplement1.html#ref-68" id="note-68">68.</a>
 Beiser (2002: 98&ndash;99) anticipates this objection and replies, on
Kant&rsquo;s behalf, that even if Berkeley intended to establish the
reality of objects in space, Kant could plausibly argue that he is
committed to their being mere illusions. But Kant&rsquo;s claim is
that Berkeley&rsquo;s idealism <em>is</em> the denial that objects
exist in space. It is not germane for Kant to argue that
Berkeley&rsquo;s idealism entails, given Kantian premises about what
constitutes the difference between truth and illusion, that objects
are illusory.</p>

<p>

 <a href="supplement2.html#ref-69" id="note-69">69.</a>
 In the second <em>Critique</em> Kant does identify Hume as a
transcendental realist (Ak. 5:53); Beiser (2002), however, argues that
this is because Kant knew Hume only from the first <em>Enquiry</em>
and was thus unaware of the phenomenalist elements in the
<em>Treatise</em>.</p>

<p>

 <a href="supplement2.html#ref-70" id="note-70">70.</a>
 The only evidence Allison gives for this claim are some texts (quoted
earlier) in which Kant calls transcendental realism the &lsquo;common
prejudice&rsquo; and a passage from his notes for the <em>What real
progress?</em> essay in which Kant claims that all philosophy before
the <em>Critique</em> was essentially the same (Ak. 20: 287, 377).</p>

<p>

 <a href="supplement2.html#ref-71" id="note-71">71.</a>
 Cf. B71 and a long passage in the P&ouml;litz lectures on theology
(Ak. 28: 1053&ndash;4) where Kant expresses agnosticism about whether,
after death, our separated souls might be able to cognize things in
themselves.</p>

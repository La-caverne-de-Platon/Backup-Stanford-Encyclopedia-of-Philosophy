<h1>Open Letter to Professional Scholars</h1>

<p>
Dear Colleagues,</p>

<p>
  The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP) is entering a crucial
phase and we need your help to secure its future.  We recognize that
your time is valuable, so if you do not have the time to read/think
about this entire letter, then please at least read the "Executive
Summary" and the final section entitled "What You Can Do". </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#Exec">Executive Summary</a></li>
<li><a href="#Fut">The SEP Future</a></li>
<li><a href="#Open">Why Open Access is Important</a></li>
<li><a href="#Problems">The Problems with a Traditional Funding Model</a></li>
<li><a href="#Fund">Our Funding Partners and Plan</a></li>
<li><a href="#What">What You Can Do</a></li>
</ul> 

<h2><a id="Exec">Executive Summary</a></h2>

<ul>

<li>The SEP
&lt;<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/" target="other">https://plato.stanford.edu/</a>&gt;
has been freely accessible since September 1995 primarily as a result
of grants awarded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the
National Science Foundation.  But since this is an inherently
uncertain method of funding the project for the long-term, we are
embarking upon a fund-raising plan on which we partner with large
library organizations to raise money both from libraries and from
private donors.  We hope to raise enough money in 3 years to operate
off the interest.</li>

 <li>The largest group of library consortia, the <strong>International
Coalition of Library Consortia</strong> (<strong>ICOLC</strong>), has
released, and circulated among its members, a "Global Call to Action"
in support of the SEP fund-raising plan.  We therefore ask you to
please print out the following document
   <blockquote> 
   <a href="ICOLC-Call.pdf" target="other">A Call for ICOLC Initiated Global Community Action</a> (PDF document)
   </blockquote>

read it, forward it to your colleagues, and send it with your, and
your department's, endorsement to the librarian who purchases
philosophy books for your institution.  Note that the funding plan
asks for only 3 one-year contributions and suggests that the libraries
and departments might need to combine resources during that time.  If
every academic library were to contribute, the suggested contribution
schedule for U.S. and Canadian institutions could be set rather low,
but the following schedule has now been set to account for the fact
that some libraries will not participate:

  <blockquote>
  <table>
   <tr>
   <td></td>
   <td><strong>Three Annual Payments of</strong></td>
   </tr>
     
   <tr>
   <td>Philosophy Ph.D. granting institutions</td>
   <td style="text-align: center;">$5000</td>
   </tr>
   
   <tr>
   <td>Philosophy M.A. granting institutions</td>
   <td style="text-align: center;">$2000</td>
   </tr>  
     
   <tr>
   <td>Philosophy B.A. granting institutions</td>
    <td style="text-align: center;">$1000</td>
   </tr>
   </table>
   </blockquote>
   
  For institutions outside the U.S. and Canada, the ICOLC plan calls for
    contributions that are appropriately calibrated to local economic 
    conditions.  You can find the contribution schedule for institutions
    outside the U.S and Canada 
   <a href="ICOLC-Call-Appendix.pdf">here</a> (in PDF).

<h2><a id="Fut">The SEP Future</a></h2>

<p>
   The SEP
 &lt;<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/" target="other">https://plato.stanford.edu/</a>&gt;
 has developed a fund-raising plan so that it can continue to operate
on its current open-access (free) model for the long term.  The key to
the success of this plan is to administer the SEP on a minimal staff
and on a small budget.  Using federal grant money from 1998 &ndash;
2003, we developed automation by which we can manage workflow and
communications with our still-growing volunteer workforce. As
of January 2014, the SEP had 1680 authors, 132 members on the
Editorial Board, 1401 online entries, a total word count of
18,261,208, and a paid staff of only 2.75 (FTE) persons.</p>

 <blockquote>
 [<a href="../about.html#pubmod" id="model" target="other">The SEP's Publishing Model</a>]
 </blockquote>

<h2><a id="Open">Why Open Access is Important</a></h2>

<p>
   We would like to remain an open access project, i.e., free to all
users.  The open access we now enjoy has been a necessary component of the
authoritativeness that the SEP has achieved on the web, as measured by
its high ranking in various search engines, such as Google.  Google
and other search engines rank pages which match a search string by
determining which of those matching pages receive the most links on
the web &mdash; the more links there are to a web page, the higher it
will be placed in the list of pages which match a search query.
Moreover, this is done recursively &mdash; webpage A will rank higher
on the list of matches than webpage B if the pages linking to A are
themselves more widely cited (because more widely linked to) than the
pages linking to B.  And so on. Thus, the fact that SEP entries rank
so highly in search engines indicates that many people with
highly-regarded websites create links to our entries.  We discovered
that if you type the titles/topics of the first 100 entries we
published into Google, 75% come up at the top of the list Google
returns, and 94% come up in the top 10 returns.  If the SEP were to
disappear behind a subscription wall, we would lose this penetration
of the search engines and our high visibility on the web. (Routledge
entries, for example, rarely show up in search engines, given that
they are behind a subscription wall; few people can access or link to
them.)  75% of our users found the SEP through a search engine.</p>
 
<blockquote>
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/info.html#access" target="other">Recent Access Statistics</a> (SEP Editorial Information page) 
 </blockquote>

<p>
  Of course, the most important reason for remaining open access is
that it would be an outstanding legacy for the SEP and profession as a
whole if it could provide both academics and non-academics around the
world with a free resource by which they could satisfy their
intellectual curiosity from an authoritative source on philosophical
questions of all kinds and, in particular, those concerning the human
condition.  This sentiment can be made tangible in the following ways,
for those with the time to think about this at greater length: </p>

</ul>


<h2><a id="Problems">The Problems With a Traditional Funding Model</a></h2>

<p>See our separate document:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <a href="problems.html">The Problems with a Traditional Funding Model</a> 
  </blockquote>

<h2><a id="Fund">Our Funding Partners and Plan</a></h2>

<p>
 We therefore held discussions with the two largest library
organizations: the International Coalition of Library Consortia
(ICOLC) and the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition
(SPARC), the latter having been formed under the auspices of the
Association of Research Libraries.  None of these organizations wanted
to see us align with a publisher and present libraries with new
yearly, increasing subscription costs.  With the enthusiastic support
of their leadership, we developed a fund-raising plan.  Under this
plan, during the 4 academic years (beginning September 2004), the
libraries conducted a world-wide drive to raise a total of $3 million,
while the SEP staff, in conjunction with Stanford University's
Development Office, endeavored to raise $1.125 million from private
donors.  Stanford invested the money raised and the SEP lives off a
portion of the interest, while the remaining interest would be
returned to the principal.  But the money would be placed in funds
that are restricted for the sole use of the SEP project. </p>

<p>
  Our library partners have won a $500,000 Challenge Grant from the
NEH, and library support of the SEP has enabled us to receive all the
matching funds from the NEH.  Indiana University Libraries has
sponsored a library membership organization, the Stanford Encyclopedia
of Philosophy International Association ("SEPIA") so that libraries
can support the SEP by paying membership dues to join SEPIA and
receive member benefits.  The Philosophy Documentation Center library
consortium is the fiscal agent for SEPIA; it registers library
commitments, invoices the libraries for membership dues, collects
those dues, and transfers the money to Stanford for deposit in the
SEP's endowment. </p>

<p>
 The most innovative part of our plan concerns the protections and
perks we've put in place to benefit the libraries. </p>
 <ol>
 <li>Libraries will be able to position their contribution as
"membership dues" to a society/organization set up for the support of
the SEP. This money would be placed in a restricted endowment, for the
sole use of the SEP.</li>
 <li>Should the SEP
<em>ever</em> terminate, the membership dues would be returned, and the
libraries would divide up the endowment <em>together with any extra
interest not expended on the project</em> in proportion to their
contribution.  Thus, library money would be held in a kind of escrow,
with Stanford managing the money. </li>
 <li>Participating libraries will be able to download and store
our quarterly archives, thereby building their collections. This
is part of the traditional mission of a library. </li>
 <li>SEP web pages sent to the institutions of contributing libraries
would be &ldquo;branded&rdquo; with a small banner acknowledging
support from the local library. </li>
 </ol>


<p>
 To make this all happen, we need pledges from as many libraries as
possible.  Indeed, this is crucial, since we believe that such pledges
will provide the evidence the National Endowment for the Humanities
needs when we ask them (this summer) to support our plan by partially
covering our operating costs while we fund-raise, through a two-year
extension on our current grant.  Subscription rates under the ICOLC
plan have been set for U.S. and Canadian academic libraries according
to the highest degree awarded in philosophy by that institution (see
the table in the Executive Summary for estimated ranges). For
institutions in other countries, the rates have been calibrated to an
estimate of local economic conditions.  </p>

<p>
 We're pleased to report that the SEP has been kept open access 
and will remain open access as a result of our funding drive.</p>

<h2><a id="What">What You Can Do</a></h2>

Here are steps you can take to help us to meet our fundraising goals:

<ol>
<li>Write to us and ask us to send you a "usage" analysis for your
institution.  We can tell you the total number of accesses to the SEP
from your institution there were last academic year and in recent
academic years.
<li>Download the 
  <a href="ICOLC-Call.pdf">Call for ICOLC Initiated Global Community Action</a>
 (PDF document) and convince yourself that the library
consortia are behind the SEP.  [This document was written by the
organizational head of the ICOLC (Tom Sanville) and endorsed at their
March 15, 2004 meetings, and it is being distributed to the libraries
by way of the consortia from the &ldquo;top-down&rdquo;.  It has also
been endorsed by the Director of SPARC (Rick Johnson).]</li>

<li>Forward the ICOLC document to your colleagues along with the
fundraising URL &lt;https://plato.stanford.edu/support/&gt;. </li>

<li>Organize a department vote to endorse the SEP plan with your library.
 By asking you to recommend the ICOLC document to your librarian, we
will thereby reach the libraries from the &ldquo;bottom-up&rdquo;.</li>
 
<li>Raise the question with your colleagues of what contribution your
department can make to the subscription level for your institution
identified by the ICOLC plan. Please note that the plan suggests that
the libraries might have to work in conjunction with philosophy
departments and <em>other</em> departments on campus, so you might
discuss with your colleagues which departments at your institution can
contribute some of the funds the library will need to participate.
</li>

<li>Follow up with your library to make sure that it has contacted
its local library consortium and made a commitment to the fund-raising
plan by December 2004.  Refer them to the page
 &lt;<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/support/commitments.html" target="other">https://plato.stanford.edu/support/commitments.html</a>&gt;
  to see how
many libraries have already signed up, and ask them to 
send email to 
  <a href="m&#97;ilto:editors&#37;40plato&#37;2estanford&#37;2eedu">editors<abbr title=" at ">&#64;</abbr>plato<abbr title=" dot ">&#46;</abbr>stanford<abbr title=" dot ">&#46;</abbr>edu</a>
to confirm their intention to join SEPIA. Please help anyone in your
department/library who is distracted by the fact that the SEP is
&ldquo;incomplete&rdquo; by pointing out that as a dynamic reference
work, the SEP will never be complete in the usual sense and that the
dynamic nature of the SEP is its principal virtue.  Moreover, you
could focus their attention on the terrific content we now have.  You
could point out (1) that there are now over 1300 entries averaging
nearly 12,000 words/entry in the SEP, (2) that both poll-based and
regular anecdotal evidence indicate that SEP entries are not only
insightful and useful to a wide range of students and scholars but
also appear on many course syllabi, and (3) that the SEP staff is
pursuing specific initiatives designed to get entries on the most
important topics in philosophy online as soon as possible.</li>

<li>Please consider 
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/support/donate.html">making a generous donation</a>
  to the SEP. [Note: Your gift will be processed by the Stanford
University Office of Development but <em>put into a special account
that is reserved for the exclusive use of the Stanford Encyclopedia of
Philosophy</em>.]
  Your contribution will help keep the SEP freely available to everyone
  on the world wide web and thereby keep our high-quality academic
  resource available to the public at large.</li>

</ol>
   
<p>
 Your efforts in mobilizing your colleagues, department, and
university library are an essential part of the plan and we hope you
will be able to come through for us.  Please help us to overcome the
free rider problem! We are counting on the fact that (philosophy)
departments and libraries will recognize that the benefits of group
action are most fairly attained when all members of the group
contribute according to their abilities. </p>

<p>
  If worst comes to worst and your library/department/institution has
no money to contribute, you might consider whether it would be in your
department/institution's interest to suspend (forego) a subscription
to some other online/print journal/reference work for only 3 years,
and use that money to help fund the SEP.  At the end of those 3 years,
your library can resume its subscriptions, having paid a small price
but also having played an important role in ensuring that
<em>everyone</em> receives the SEP for free thereafter.</p>

<p>
 Finally, in reading this message, our <em>authors</em> and
<em>editors</em> will recognize that the success of the plan depends
in part on our continuing to build content in the SEP.  Inaction on
the part of our volunteer workforce thus carries a danger to the
community, and we hope they will be motivated thereby to discharge
their SEP work in a timely way.  Of course, we really do appreciate
their volunteered time, and we hope they won't be offended by our
attempt to counter the myth that delaying a web publication has no
negative consequences.</p>

<p>
 Thanks very much for your efforts in support of the SEP.  We
anticipate a successful fund-raising drive. </p>

<p>
Yours,</p>

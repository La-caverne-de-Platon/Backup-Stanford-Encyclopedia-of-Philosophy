<h2><a name="RelIss">Related Issues</a></h2>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s philosophy is extraordinarily systematic and
innovative, and Anomalous Monism is only one of his fundamental
contributions to the philosophical landscape. In this supplement, we first
look at issues that have arisen in considering how Anomalous Monism
relates to two of the other pillars of his work: the rejection of
conceptual relativism and its underlying dualism between conceptual
scheme and uninterpreted empirical content, which Davidson refers to
as the &ldquo;third dogma of empiricism&rdquo;, and the semantic
externalist thesis that the determinants of linguistic meaning and
mental content lie in the external world rather than on the surfaces
of, or even further within, persons&rsquo; bodies. There are
interesting questions about the relationship between each of these
doctrines and Anomalous Monism. We also look at the relationship between Anomalous Monism and freedom, about which Davidson has made tantalizing but largely undeveloped remarks.</p>

<h3><a name="AnoMonSchConDua">1. Anomalous Monism and Scheme-Content Dualism</a></h3>

<p>
Davidson (1974a) argued against a traditional distinction underlying
modern and much contemporary philosophy between concepts or conceptual
schemes and empirical content&mdash;intuitions or uninterpreted
sensory events. The argument turns largely on the connection between
those ideas and the notion of an untranslatable language. Davidson
argued that this notion must be rejected, and that doing so largely
eliminated the threat of conceptual relativism, providing a sort of
guarantee that our most fundamental beliefs are by and large true. The
details of the argument will not concern us here. However, a number of
critics have claimed that Davidson&rsquo;s rejection of conceptual
relativism and its underlying dualism between conceptual scheme and
empirical content is inconsistent with one or another premise in his
argument for anomalous monism. McDowell suggested that the cause-law
principle was in tension with it. Manuel di Pinedo has more recently
argued that both the cause-law principle as well as Davidson&rsquo;s
related extensionalism about events&mdash;and therefore his
token-identity theory of mind&mdash;are inconsistent with it. And
Solomon early on suggested that mental anomalism conflicts with it
(Solomon 1974). In this section we look briefly at these issues.</p>

<p>
McDowell suggested that Davidson&rsquo;s commitment to the cause-law
principle was in tension with Davidson&rsquo;s rejection of
scheme-content dualism&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;third dogma&rdquo;
of empiricism (McDowell 1985; Davidson 1974a)&mdash;and in effect
constituted a fourth dogma of empiricism. McDowell does not think the
cause-law principle is needed for a minimal version of materialism,
and claims that without the need to justify materialism there is no
rationale for it in Davidson&rsquo;s framework.</p>

<p>
One way of parsing McDowell&rsquo;s idea is that the only plausible
rationale for the requirement of strict covering laws for singular
causal relations is based on the Humean claims, first, that we
can&rsquo;t perceive singular causal relations, and, second, that
therefore the only way to distinguish between events that are causally
related and those that stand in a relation of mere temporal succession
is to bring in the concept of regular succession, with its close ties
to the notion of a strict covering law. Scheme-content dualism
supposedly enters into Hume&rsquo;s argument with the idea that the
concept of necessary connection stands distinct from the content of
the experience of singular events (McDowell 1985, 398). As we have
already seen
 (<a href="index-2.html#JusCauLawPri">3.2&ndash;3</a>),
 however, Davidson&rsquo;s argument in support of the cause-law
principle does not appeal to any such claim, and so while it may well
be true that this principle bears some relation to the third dogma,
how it does isn&rsquo;t apparent in Davidson&rsquo;s actual thinking.
The mere fact that Davidson is arguing in favor of the cause-law
principle does not itself entail a commitment to the Humean view of
the content of the experience of singular events that invites the
worry. As McDowell himself notes, Davidson is not offering a reduction
or analysis of singular causal statements in terms of the principle,
but is merely stating a necessary condition for such statements. It is
not at all obvious that insisting on such a condition forces a
position either way on scheme-content dualism.</p>

<p>
De Pinedo (2006) offers one way to clarify the supposed relation
between the cause-law principle and the third dogma, by focusing on
Davidson&rsquo;s metaphysics of events. In particular, de Pinedo
emphasizes that Davidson&rsquo;s argument for monism depends upon the
extensionalist view that the same event can be described in different
vocabularies. As we saw in
 <a href="index-2.html#ArgForAnoMon">1</a>,
 Davidson had pointed out that Hume&rsquo;s covering law requirement
is not committed to the idea that the vocabulary in which the singular
events are picked out must be the vocabulary in which the covering law
is formulated, and from this together with the extensionalist
assumption moved to the monistic conclusion that anomic mental events
have physical descriptions that instantiate strict laws. De Pinedo
argues that this extensionalism is in direct conflict with
Davidson&rsquo;s rejection of the third dogma, because it entails that
the events variously described are &ldquo;noumenal&rdquo; (di Pinedo
2006, 86&ndash;90, using Kant&rsquo;s term for things in themselves,
independent of conceptualization), and that positing them depends upon
a &ldquo;schemeless method&rdquo; for individuating events (de Pinedo
2006, 87)&mdash;one that &ldquo;allows us to say that the same event
is both the one described by the nomological vocabulary of physics and
by the normative vocabulary of psychology&rdquo;. And he claims that
Davidson&rsquo;s criterion for event-individuation&mdash;that two
events are identical if and only if they share all causes and
effects&mdash;is precisely an attempt to provide such a method (de
Pinedo 2006, 83&ndash;84). Since the ideas of &ldquo;noumenal&rdquo;
events and &ldquo;schemeless&rdquo; individuation methods seem so
intimately caught up with the third dogma, di Pinedo claims that their
source&mdash;extensionalism&mdash;and
bounty&mdash;token-identity&mdash;must both be rejected.</p>

<p>
Extensionalist criteria (whether it is Davidson&rsquo;s earlier causal
or later spatiotemporal version) are supposed to be a
&ldquo;schemeless&rdquo; method because they apply indiscriminately to
all events, no matter how they are described. Davidson needs such an
indiscriminate criterion in order to derive monism, but according to
de Pinedo is not entitled to it precisely because of the basis for
mental anomalism&mdash;that the constitutive criteria for the mental
and the physical are distinct. de Pinedo asks: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
From where does Davidson get his token-identities then? What area of
our picture of reality can simultaneously capture nomological and
anomalous features of the same event? &hellip;the identities&hellip;do
not fit any of our conceptual devices. Davidson is defenseless against
the accusation that that such identities are noumenal. (de Pinedo
2006, 89)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
De Pinedo&rsquo;s objection seems to be that any particular claim that
this mental event is token-identical to that physical event cannot be
made from the perspective of either the mental or the physical
explanatory schemes, and there is no other explanatory scheme from
which to make such a claim. So it can only be made from a schemeless
perspective&mdash;which makes it noumenal and thus in conflict with
Davidson&rsquo;s rejection of the third dogma. As de Pinedo says, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
which entities get related to which other entities cannot be
postulated independently of the conceptual framework needed to make
sense of such relations. But, famously, that framework excludes laws
connecting mental and physical predicates. (di Pinedo 2006, 83) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This presumably is behind de Pinedo&rsquo;s related point that
Davidson&rsquo;s distinction between causal relations and causal
explanations is also in conflict with his rejection of the third dogma
because of its basis in the extensionalist view of events (di Pinedo
2006, 83).</p>

<p>
Three points need to be addressed in response to di Pinedo. First,
extensionalism by itself does not entail that there are possible
correct descriptions of events that are radically different from the
familiar descriptions of our current scheme or some conservative
extension of it. It is only if such descriptions&mdash;ones that are
not translatable&mdash;are possible that the conclusion might follow
that the events are &ldquo;noumenal&rdquo;. And, most importantly,
there is nothing in the extensionalist picture itself that entails
this, and Davidson&rsquo;s own argument that tells against their
possibility. This shows that Davidson&rsquo;s extensionalism and
rejection of the third dogma are fully consistent with each other.</p>

<p>
Second, de Pinedo appears to think that for something to be an
explanatory framework it must issue in strict laws. If this were true,
then the most basic sorts of event-identity claims&mdash;for instance,
between the most newsworthy event of the day and the bridge&rsquo;s
collapse&mdash;would have to be rejected because belonging to distinct
frameworks. Furthermore, an explanatory scientific framework relating
specific physical and mental properties does exist (see the supplement
on
 <a href="explanatory.html">Explanatory Epiphenomenalism</a>).
 The fact that it can&rsquo;t issue in exceptionless laws relating the
two does not mean it is illusory&mdash;Davidson himself is clear on
this in allowing for <em>ceteris paribus</em> relations between the
mental and physical schemes. And while there may be philosophical and
empirical problems concerning how to justify particular claims of
token-identities, we have seen that they don&rsquo;t affect
Davidson&rsquo;s considered view of monism
 (<a href="index-2.html#ObjTokIde">5.2</a>).</p>
 
<p>
Third, as we have seen, Davidson&rsquo;s monism is not in any case
based in particular identifications of mental and physical events, but
rather in an <em>a priori</em> argument. So de Pinedo&rsquo;s
questions above must be understood to be concerned with the
perspective from which such <em>a priori</em> philosophical claims
generally are made, because they typically are made <em>about</em>
explanatory frameworks and <em>not</em> within them&mdash;for
instance, the question of how the mental and physical frameworks
relate to each other, and the question whether we can make sense of
alternative conceptual schemes. These sorts of questions arise from
within our general conceptual scheme, when we look at its various
commitments and explore their consistency. One of philosophy&rsquo;s
central tasks has always been to probe the foundations and relations
between explanatory frameworks.</p>

<p>
Davidson made a related point to a related concern expressed early on
by Robert Solomon, who asked how Davidson&rsquo;s rejection of
conceptual relativism could be squared with his assertion of mental
anomalism and its claim that the mental and physical schemes are
incommensurable (Solomon 1974, 66). Solomon assumed that
Davidson&rsquo;s rejection of conceptual relativism entailed that all
explanatory schemes must be
commensurable&mdash;inter-translatable&mdash;and thus mutually
reducible. Davidson replied by pointing out that his rejection of
conceptual relativism and incommensurability concerns an entire
language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
nothing&hellip; can be left out that is needed to make sense of the
rest&hellip;.Psychological concepts&hellip;cannot be reduced&hellip;to
others. But they are essential to our understanding of the rest.
(Davidson 1974c, 243&ndash;44) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Davidson&rsquo;s point is that the incommensurability posited by
mental anomalism holds between subparts of one full-blown language,
not between two such languages. Psychological concepts are essential
to understanding language because of the ineliminable role they play
in communication and interpretation. One key point Davidson is making
here, which is relevant to the previous discussion of de Pinedo, is
that our conceptual scheme already contains <em>ceteris paribus</em>
laws relating the mental and the physical that we rely upon in
understanding each other. Scientific investigation into the relation
between mental and physical events is a refinement of an already
existing framework&mdash;limited, according to mental anomalism, but
nonetheless explanatory and fruitful.</p>

<h3><a name="MenAnoSemExt">2. Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism</a></h3>

<p>
Semantic externalism holds that the meanings of linguistic expressions
and/or the contents of mental states and events are constituted, at
least in part, by objects and events in the external world. In this
section we look at Davidson&rsquo;s commitment to this doctrine and
its relationship to mental anomalism. In some ways, formulating the
issues in terms of mental content and thoughts makes the philosophical
stakes clearer: according to semantic externalism, without an external
world, there would be no mental content to thoughts. And mental
anomalism is in the first instance formulated in mental rather than
linguistic terms. However, the issues carry over without significant
remainder for Davidson. For ease of exposition, our discussion will,
depending on context, be alternately framed in terms both of meaning,
utterances or expressions and in terms of content and thoughts. As we
have seen
 (<a href="index-2.html#CauDefArg">4.3</a>),
 the causal definition argument interprets mental anomalism as flowing
from Davidson&rsquo;s independent commitments concerning the causal
nature of mental concepts. Semantic externalism is essentially a
thesis about the causal constitution of mental content by external
objects and events. So it provides additional support for the causal
definition argument&rsquo;s approach to mental anomalism.</p>

<p>
Davidson argues that mental contents are determined by their external,
environmental causes&mdash;&ldquo;water&rdquo; refers to
H<sub>2</sub>O because H<sub>2</sub>O is the systematic cause of
tokenings of &ldquo;water&rdquo; during its period of acquisition by
an agent. Another agent could mean, and therefore think, something
different by &ldquo;water&rdquo;&mdash;the substance XYZ
instead&mdash;because of differences in the environment and history of
acquisition of their concept. Davidson claims that this entails
psychophysical anomalism. He argues that two agents could be in
identical internal physical conditions while thinking different
thoughts expressed by &ldquo;water&rdquo;, and thus realizing
different mental properties, because their respective histories of
causal interaction and acquisition of the relevant concepts are
different. If this is the case, then semantic externalism rules out
the possibility of strict laws of the form
&lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;<em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;
(Davidson 1987a, 1995b).</p>

<p>
A natural response to this argument is that if the environments of the
two agents are different, and this is responsible for their semantic
divergence, then that environmental difference simply needs to be
folded into the relevant laws, which are of course massively
underdescribed anyway (clearly more than <em>P</em><sub>1</sub> by
itself is needed to guarantee any effect, and thus M<sub>1</sub>).
Thus, in the H<sub>2</sub>O world,
&lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<em>P</em><sub>2</sub>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;<em>M</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo;
would hold, while in the XYZ world,
&lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<em>P</em><sub>3</sub>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;<em>M</em><sub>2</sub>&rsquo;
would hold, with &lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>1</sub>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<em>P</em><sub>2</sub>&rsquo; in each law representing the
semantically relevant environmental differences of the two worlds.
This maneuver would effectively block counterexamples of the kind
suggested by Davidson&rsquo;s argument by preventing the same
antecedents of laws&mdash;which only as a set guarantee the
consequent&mdash;from being met by two individuals with different
histories of acquisition, and thus different concepts. This response
would thereby do away with any exceptions to the laws based on
semantic externalism. It would thereby block Davidson&rsquo;s argument
from semantic externalism to mental anomalism.</p>

<p>
However, there are externalist thought experiments intended to show
that two individuals could be in <em>globally</em> physically
indiscernible circumstances and yet still be mentally
distinct&mdash;either with different thoughts, or with one thinking
thoughts and the other having no thoughts at all. Davidson develops
the latter sort of case (1987a, 443&ndash;44), in which a creature is
imagined emerging <em>ex nihilo</em>, with no causal history at all,
yet physically identical to another individual. In this case, Davidson
claims that the new creature would simply lack all thought content
because of lack of any history of acquisition. In the former sort of
case (see Boghossian 1989), an agent from one world is transported to
the other world, retaining her original thought contents because of
the history of acquisition condition, and therefore constituting a
counterexample to that new world&rsquo;s laws. Both cases would
effectively prevent the maneuver of folding environmental differences
into the relevant laws so as to block the counterexamples, because the
global physical indiscernibility of the imagined worlds (essentially
amounting to the two creatures inhabiting the same world) provides
nothing on which to pin the semantic divergence. If such cases are
convincing, then no strict psychophysical laws with mental consequents
would be possible, because of the possibility of such counterexamples
to any laws relating physical antecedents to mental consequents. (For
discussion of these issues, see Shea 2003.)</p>

<p>
Many questions arise concerning these thought experiments, primarily
regarding the nature of or need for a history of acquisition condition
and its bearing across worlds. But many other aspects of these cases
are controversial, not the least of which is the basic externalist
doctrine that the contents of thoughts and meanings of expressions
derive essentially from distal environmental causes, as opposed to
sensory surface stimulations or even internal brain processing. But we
have at least seen how Davidson conceives of the relation between
mental anomalism and semantic externalism, and how it illustrates the
causal definition argument&rsquo;s key claim that it is due to the
causal nature of mental states that strict psychophysical laws are
impossible.</p>

<p>
A different connection between semantic externalism and mental
anomalism in Davidson&rsquo;s thinking has been explored by Yalowitz
(1998a,b), who lays out the framework of an extended debate between
Davidson and Quine over the nature of language and thought and the
scientific status of psychology. According to Yalowitz&rsquo;s
reading, they share three key assumptions in that debate. First, that
the scientific status of an explanatory framework depends upon its
potential for delivering strict laws (this is largely definitional).
Second, that the most promising approach to semantics is a causal
theory, which in broad stroke holds that the objects or events that
cause an utterance to be tokened by an agent determine the meaning of
that utterance. And third, that there is a puzzle about whether strict
causal laws are consistent with a coherent semantic theory. The puzzle
is that any adequate semantic theory must be able to make sense of the
notion of mistaken usage of an expression or tokening of a mental
content, because meanings/contents are individuated by their
<em>conditions of correct usage</em>&mdash;what makes
&ldquo;water&rdquo; mean or apply to what it does is determined by
conditions under which &ldquo;water&rdquo; is correctly tokened. A
first pass at a strict semantic-determining law might say something
like the following: &lsquo;for all <em>x</em>&rsquo;s, if <em>x</em>
causes <em>y</em> to be tokened, then <em>y</em> means
<em>x</em>&rsquo;. And in holding that <em>whatever</em> causes a
<em>y</em> to be tokened determines the meaning of <em>y</em>, no room
would be made for cases of error&mdash;cases where some <em>z</em>
causes <em>y</em> to be tokened, but <em>y</em> nonetheless counts as
mistakenly applied to <em>z</em>. The point is that all sorts of
things stand in causal relations to tokenings. There is a considerable
problem of determining which of these myriad causes constitutes the
conditions of correctness, rather than occasions of mistaken usage.
Without such a distinction, the most basic condition of adequacy for a
semantic theory will not have been met.</p>

<p>
According to Yalowitz, Quine and Davidson diverge in how to deal with
this problem of error. Quine, committed to providing a scientific
framework for semantics, holds on to the requirement that semantics
issue in strict semantic-determining laws, and responds to the problem
of error by holding that mistaken utterances of an individual can be
identified only relative to a norm established by the usage of other
speakers of the same language. Individuals considered in isolation,
then, cannot be assigned meanings. Individuals must share a language
with others, relative to which their usage can gauged for correctness,
in order for the utterances to mean something&mdash;to have conditions
of correctness. Further, according to Quine, in order for semantic
laws to be strict the conditions of correctness must be located
<em>proximally</em> rather than <em>distally</em>, in the sensory
stimulations on the bodily surfaces of individuals&rsquo; bodies
rather than in the external environment of objects and events shared
by them. As Davidson observes, the further out one goes in the causal
chain extending beyond a person&rsquo;s skin, the greater chance there
is that the chain can be interfered with, with the result that the
appropriate behavior is not triggered (Davidson 1992, 262). The
proximal cause thus </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
has the best claim to be called the stimulus, since the more distant
an event is causally the more chance there is that the causal chain
will be broken. (Davidson 1989, 197) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here Yalowitz identifies a fourth key assumption shared by Quine and
Davidson: that degree of distance between cause and effect bears
directly on the possibility of strict lawful relations (on which see
further below). Quine therefore deals with (1) the problem of
accounting for the possibility of error (2) within a scientific
semantic framework by requiring both that individuals share languages
with others (which responds to (1)), and that meaning is determined by
proximal as opposed to distal causes (which responds to (2)).</p>

<p>
According to Yalowitz&rsquo;s reading, Davidson&rsquo;s general
approach to semantics and to the possibility of a scientific
psychology is formulated largely in response to these positions of
Quine&rsquo;s. The key divergence comes in Davidson&rsquo;s rejection
of Quine&rsquo;s solution to the problem of accounting for error and
thus conditions of correctness. For Davidson, this specific sort of
communal solution to the problem of error leads to an objectionable
sort of relativism which is inadequate for a genuinely objective
notion of error (Davidson 1984, xix; 1990, 309). The possibility of
error cannot be due merely to the relationship between different
individuals&rsquo; overlapping linguistic dispositions. Otherwise, the
notion of truth will be reduced to mere agreement. It thus must be
reflected directly in semantic-determining laws governing
individuals&rsquo; usage. The issue, then, is how to do this. Davidson
goes on to reject Quine&rsquo;s location of the conditions of
correctness that determine meaning proximally, on individuals&rsquo;
bodily surfaces, in response to this problem. Instead, he insists that
conditions of correctness must be located in the shared external
environment of individuals. We have seen that this increase in
distance, according to Davidson, allows for greater possibility of
interference in the chain between cause (condition of correctness) and
effect (utterance). This interference thus allows for a more slack
relation between conditions of correctness and utterances that in turn
allows Davidson to make sense of the notion of error without appealing
to a shared language community. Since, then, strict semantic laws
cannot account for error, and are tied to proximal conditions of
correctness, Davidson insists on distal conditions of correctness and
the subsequent anomic&mdash;<em>ceteris paribus</em>&mdash;semantic
laws expressing them, which have the slackness necessary for
accounting for the possibility of error. Semantic externalism is thus
motivated in large part by the key condition of adequacy for semantic
theory&mdash;accounting for the possibility of error and thus
conditions of correctness for meanings and concepts. And mental
anomalism is claimed to be necessary for accounting for error and thus
meaning and content.</p>

<p>
Yalowitz&rsquo;s reading of how semantic externalism and mental
anomalism are related is largely historical and reconstructive. While
it makes clear contact with some of Davidson&rsquo;s statements
concerning these issues, and highlights the significant and
longstanding philosophical (and, indeed, personal) relationship
between Davidson and Quine going back to Davidson&rsquo;s graduate
study at Harvard, there is much that it doesn&rsquo;t account for, and
many points of detail that require fleshing out. Further, as Yalowitz
himself notes, it commits Davidson to a rather unconvincing argument
for both mental anomalism and semantic externalism. It is clearly
false that degree of distance between cause and effect is tied to the
distinction between strict and <em>ceteris paribus</em> laws. The
greater possibility of interference by itself doesn&rsquo;t force an
anomalous relation between cause and effect. It simply requires a
broadening of the conditions in the antecedent of the law, leaving
wide open the question of whether this broadening can be
completed&mdash;fully articulated&mdash;to the point of providing a
strict law. If that is not possible, and such laws are essentially
<em>ceteris paribus</em>, this has nothing especially to do with the
possibility of interference by itself. Therefore, the connection
between the possibility of error, mental anomalism and semantic
externalism is not as straightforward as Yalowitz&rsquo;s reading
suggests. However, Yalowitz&rsquo;s framing of the debate between
Davidson and Quine on these issues and its bearing on Davidson&rsquo;s
views concerning semantic externalism and mental anomalism does have
the virtue of providing for a kind of bridge between the two very
different readings of the argument for mental anomalism
 (<a href="index-2.html#RatArg">4.2&ndash;4.3</a>).
 While it locates concerns about the causal definition of mental
concepts as fundamental to that argument, its focus on the normative
notion of error&mdash;mistaken usage&mdash;is intimately related to
concerns about rationality. For Davidson, to be rational requires
applying concepts, and concepts require conditions of correctness.
Assuming a causal approach to determining such conditions, the line of
argument Yalowitz reconstructs holds that both mental anomalism and
semantic externalism are needed in order to make sense of concepts and
therefore rationality. While perhaps not as tightly related as this
reconstruction portrays, these several theses are clearly absolutely
central to Davidson&rsquo;s philosophy of mind generally, and
therefore Anomalous Monism.</p>

<h3><a name="AnomMoniFree">3. Anomalous Monism and Freedom</a></h3>

<p>
In this section we explore the relationship between Anomalous Monism
and the nature and possibility of human freedom. Initially, the
connection seems to be clear. Human freedom intuitively seems to be
threatened by the existence of strict predictive psychological and
psychophysical laws, since if our actions can be exceptionlessly
predicted ahead of time it seems that we lack choice or control over
them. And since mental anomalism denies the existence of such laws, it
should thus be considered (and Davidson claims it to be) a key necessary
condition of human freedom. However, this intuitive connection is
complicated by the monism component of Anomalous Monism, since monism,
as understood by Davidson, entails that every event &ndash; including
human actions &ndash; is covered by a strict physical law. It is also
complicated by the existence of conceptions of compatibilism about
freedom and determinism that explicitly allow for the possibility of
strict psychological and psychophysical laws. The intuitive connection
between Anomalous Monism and freedom therefore needs some
sorting out. The literature on freedom and determinism has gotten
extremely complex since Davidson&rsquo;s remarks on them and their
relation to Anomalous Monism, so the following can be no more than a
brief and selective overview, in order to better place
Davidson&rsquo;s position within both historical and contemporary
discussions (see also 
 <a href="related-views.html#SpiPar">Related Views: 1. Spinoza&rsquo;s Parallelism</a>). 
 We
will focus on two key issues: the connection to Kant&rsquo;s theory of
freedom, which Davidson claims bears a close relation to Anomalous
Monism, and the more general claim that Anomalous Monism is a key
necessary condition for freedom. As we shall see, both claims
are far more complex and problematic than Davidson&rsquo;s brief remarks
recognize.</p>

<p>
To begin, consider the basic picture of action offered to us by
Anomalous Monism. Monism entails that strict physical laws determine
that one&rsquo;s arm will go up on a particular occasion, and this
bodily movement can, in principle, be exceptionlessly predicted.
However, mental anomalism entails that whether that rising of the arm
is token-identical to a <em>raising</em> of one&rsquo;s arm &ndash; an
intentional action &ndash; is not something that can be predicted
exceptionlessly. Complete knowledge of physical law cannot decide
whether the rising of an arm is an arm-raising. The arm-rising is an arm-raising if it is caused, in the right way, by a primary reason (a belief-desire pair that rationalizes an arm-raising) and while primary reasons are token identical with brain states, there are, according to mental anomalism, no psychophysical laws that can exceptionlessly predict when a brain state will be a primary reason. (As discussed below, the fact that the event, as described physically, is determined does not entail that the event, as described mentally, is determined.) Two immediate points
come up here. First, one kind of freedom made room for by Anomalous
Monism appears to be freedom with respect to whether one&rsquo;s arm
going up is an instance of one&rsquo;s intentionally raising
one&rsquo;s arm. One&rsquo;s arm is determined to go up; this leaves
it as an open question whether this event can be described as an
intentional action. But by itself, this is not an intuitively adequate
conception of what freedom consists in. While interpretative
considerations of rationality and Davidson&rsquo;s basic theory of
action address the gap between rising and raising to some extent, they at best provide a theory of what mere intentional action consists in. But <em>free</em> action goes beyond mere intentional action; and Davidson nowhere provides
considerations that address this further gap (see discussion below). Second, this is not a picture where alternative
possible actions or choices in any clear sense play a role &ndash; the
alternative isn&rsquo;t an action or choice at all, it&rsquo;s a
non-intentional bodily movement. As we will see below, Davidson in
fact rejects the intuitive, traditional requirement that freedom entails the
ability to do or choose otherwise. But we will see that this point
stands in some tension with Davidson&rsquo;s claim that mental
anomalism is key necessary condition for freedom.</p>

<h4 id="AnomMoniKant">3.1 Anomalous Monism and Kant&rsquo;s Theory of Freedom</h4>

<p>
Davidson opens and closes his definitive statement of Anomalous Monism
(Davidson 1970) with remarks concerning Kant&rsquo;s views on human
freedom. He starts by expressing sympathy with claims of Kant&rsquo;s
concerning the need to eradicate any appearance of contradiction
between the ideas of human freedom and natural necessity, noting that
the same need exists if &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo; is substituted for
freedom, and that for Kant freedom entails anomaly (as we shall see
below, this last point is more complicated than Davidson seems to
recognize). He likens these to his own attempt to make consistent the
interaction, cause-law, and anomalism principles. And he ends by first
emphasizing the point that psychological explanation operates in a
very different conceptual framework than physical explanation, and
that mental anomalism is a necessary condition for viewing actions as
free. But he then quotes approvingly of Kant&rsquo;s claim that not
only can these different conceptual frameworks co-exist, they must
also be thought &ldquo;as necessarily united in the same
subject&rdquo; (Davidson 1970, 225). And he likens this latter thought
to the monism he has used to resolve the apparent tension between
those principles. Davidson goes no further in relating his views to
Kant&rsquo;s, but some Kant commentators have followed up on these
remarks with extended treatments of the relation between the two
views.</p>

<p>
Anomalous Monism has been claimed, by Ralf Meerbote (Meerbote 1984)
and Hud Hudson (Hudson 1994, 2002), to be an appropriate framework for
articulating Kant&rsquo;s theory of freedom. In claiming this,
Meerbote and Hudson understand Kant to be a compatibilist about
freedom and determinism, rather than the incompatibilist he has usually
been labeled. According to both, Kant&rsquo;s notion of the
&ldquo;causality of reason&rdquo; and how it fits into his
deterministic account of the natural world is best understood along
the following lines. Reasons are token identical to physical (brain)
states, and the causality of reason is to be understood as the causal
interaction of reasons under their physical descriptions. Under their
mental descriptions, reasons only bear a rationalizing relationship to
the actions that they explain. Kant&rsquo;s key notion of
&ldquo;spontaneity&rdquo;, which is generally thought to be the
foundation for both his view of freedom and subsequent
incompatibilism, is understood in terms of a belief-desire model of
deliberation on which agents choose freely when they have
<em>epistemic autonomy</em> &ndash; they are able to stand back from
their beliefs and desires, decide which are rationally defensible, and
act in accordance with this decision. On Meerbote&rsquo;s and
Hudson&rsquo;s views, such spontaneity is compatible with determinism
(see further below).</p>

<p>
Meerbote and Hudson read Kant&rsquo;s Transcendental Idealism, and in
particular Kant&rsquo;s key distinction between the phenomenal and the
noumenal (things as they appear to us and things as they are in
themselves), according to the &ldquo;two-descriptions&rdquo; view,
which has been articulated and defended most recently and thoroughly
by Henry Allison (Allison, 1983). And they (unlike Allison &ndash; see
below) relate that distinction closely to the distinction between
physical and mental descriptions of singular events. On the
two-descriptions view, we can consider the objects and events of human
experience in two distinct ways: as they appear to us and as they are
in themselves. Things as they appear to us must conform to the conditions
that are necessary for us to experience and represent them. In
particular, they must appear within space and time, and must conform
to the causal principle that every event has a cause and is determined
to occur, which is established in Kant&rsquo;s Second Analogy (Allison 1990,
2&ndash;4; Kant 1781/1786). Things in themselves can be thought of independently of
the conditions under which we must experience them, though they cannot
be known because of the limitations imposed by our cognitive
apparatus. This two-descriptions view contrasts with the two-worlds
interpretation of Kant&rsquo;s distinction, according to which
appearances and things in themselves constitute two ontologically
distinct sets of entities (Allison 1990, 4). Here we set aside the
two-worlds view, since none of the participants in the debate about the
relation between Kant&rsquo;s theory of freedom and Anomalous Monism
hold it.</p>

<p>
On both Meerbote&rsquo;s and Hudson&rsquo;s view of Kant (Meerbote
1984,155; Hudson 2002, 247), description types used in describing
things as they appear to us are law-like and thus deterministic, while
descriptions types used for things in themselves are not. 
The general picture they share can be summarized as follows: action
explanations are compatible with the determinism of the physical realm
because such explanations are not causal but instead are
rationalizations. Since they aren&rsquo;t causal, they aren&rsquo;t
law-like &ndash; this is the Kantian analogue to mental anomalism.
However, because psychological descriptions pick out physical events
&ndash; monism &ndash; we can make sense of a &ldquo;causality of
reason&rdquo; in terms of the causal powers of psychological events
under their physical descriptions. The resulting Kantian compatibilism
about freedom and determinism is established by denying that mental
events can be deterministically predicted or explained in the language
of psychology (mental anomalism) but maintaining that mental events
are part of nature and are determined and determining (i.e. have
causal powers in accordance with the strictures of the Second Analogy)
under their physical descriptions as events in the brain. There are
many interesting issues that arise in considering the details of this
interpretation which we cannot investigate here. In considering the
relationship between this interpretation of Kant&rsquo;s theory of
freedom and Anomalous Monism, we will focus on the general picture,
and in particular the role that causality plays in it.</p>

<p>
What is notable about this picture is the claim that causality plays
no role in psychological explanation itself, and its centrality in
connecting Kant&rsquo;s theory with Anomalous Monism. We are being
presented with a picture almost identical to one that Davidson
criticized from his earliest writings, according to which
psychological explanations are non-causal and therefore anomalous
rationalizations, while physical explanations are causal and therefore
law-like. As we have seen in 
 <a href="index-2.html#MenCau">2.2</a>, 
Davidson insists on the need for
causal descriptions <em>within</em> psychological explanations in
order to solve the &ldquo;because&rdquo; problem: we can&rsquo;t pick
out the actual reasons that explain an action (as opposed to reasons
that the agent has available and that could rationalize the action but
that don&rsquo;t actually play a role in explaining it) unless we see
the explanatory reason as <em>causing</em> the action (so that
causality is essential to articulating a distinction between active
and dormant reasons). This, together with the key point that singular
causal relations between psychologically described events don&rsquo;t
entail law-like psychological relations, allowed Davidson to unify the
two competing theories of action &ndash; the hermeneutical and the
causal theories. Hudson (Hudson 2002, 261) shows some awareness of
this issue, in expressing sympathy with the interaction principle,
which plays a key role in Davidson&rsquo;s argument for monism. But he
fails to recognize that this principle is <em>independent</em> of and
<em>prior</em> to Davidson&rsquo;s monism, since it figures in an argument for
it. For Hudson, the interaction principle can only be made sense of by
assuming monism and then claiming that mental events cause physical
events by virtue of being identical with the physical events that play
the truly causal role. For Davidson, this gets things backwards: the
interaction principle is assumed, and it is then shown that it,
together with the anomalism and cause-law principles, entails
monism.</p>

<p>
It therefore is not plausible to present Kant&rsquo;s theory of
freedom, as understood by Meerbote and Hudson, as a precursor to
Anomalous monism. Henry Allison has also disputed the interpretative
claims of Meerbote and Hudson concerning Kant&rsquo;s theory itself.
Though we can&rsquo;t settle that interpretative dispute here, it is
worth noting two key points involved in it. First, Allison strongly
emphasizes a distinction that Kant draws between empirical and
intelligible character. What is important in this distinction is that
reason has botM an empirical, phenomenal character as well as an
intelligible, noumenal character. The empirical character of reason
seems to get lost in Meerbote&rsquo;s and Hudson&rsquo;s accounts
&ndash; reason explanations are pushed purely into the noumenal realm.
Second, and related to the first point, Allison sees the notion of the
causality of the will as absolutely central to Kant&rsquo;s conception
of freedom, and therefore finds the compatibilist picture presented by
Meerbote and Hudson, on which there is no psychological causation <em>per
se</em> but only by virtue of identity with physical events, unable to
account for Kant&rsquo;s picture. One way of thinking about this point
relates to our previous criticism of Meerbote&rsquo;s and
Hudson&rsquo;s removal of the concept of causality from psychological
explanations. On both Allison&rsquo;s interpretation of Kant and the
interpretation of Davidson offered here, there must be causation
<em>within</em> the psychological realm itself in order to account for
all of our commitments about the mental.</p>

<p>
However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that there is a convergence between
Allison&rsquo;s own view of Kant and Anomalous Monism. For one thing,
the causation internal to the psychological takes place at the
empirical level for Davidson, while it crucially must take place at
the noumenal level according to Allison in order to account for
freedom. Allison holds that the spontaneity in deliberation required
for genuine freedom &ndash; involving the capacity to stand back from
one&rsquo;s reasons and evaluate them for justification &ndash; is not
possible empirically but only noumenally. And as Allison emphasizes in
his reading, Kant actually allows for empirical, strict psychological
laws. Here Allison points to potentially conflicting claims that Kant
makes: first, Kant appears to insist on psychological or
psychophysical determinism &ndash; the view that all human actions are
determined and predictable by the person&rsquo;s empirical character
(the causality of reason, and thus of beliefs, desires, and other
psychological states) together with other contributing causal factors
(Allison 1990, 31). Yet Kant appears to deny that there can be
empirical psychological or psychophysical laws (Allison 1990,
31&ndash;34, 43). It isn&rsquo;t easy to see how these two claims can
be made consistent, though Allison tries to do so within Kant&rsquo;s
framework. In any case, Davidson&rsquo;s position is that
psychological and psychophysical determinism are both ruled out at the
empirical level by mental anomalism. As we&rsquo;ve seen, Meerbote and
Hudson both emphasize Kant&rsquo;s denial of empirical psychological
and psychophysical laws in trying to connect his views with Anomalous
Monism. And in one sense that is the right direction to go in aligning
Kant with Davidson, since the thesis of mental anomalism is concerned
with empirical reality. However, as noted earlier, Meerbote and Hudson
can&rsquo;t make full sense of Davidson&rsquo;s position on this since
they push psychological explanation entirely into the noumenal realm.
Meerbote in fact claims that, for Kant, psychological events are not
locatable in space or time except in so far as the physical token
events that they are identical to are &ndash; the categories of
causality, space, and time are not applicable to the noumenal realm,
and therefore to psychological events (Meerbote 1984, 157; see also
Hudson 2002, 247). It is worth noting, on this latter issue, that
Davidson famously has rejected the very <em>idea</em> of a noumenal
realm (Davidson 1974a; see 
 <a href="#AnoMonSchConDua">Related Issues: 1. Anomalous Monism and Scheme-Content Dualism</a>), 
 making Meerbote&rsquo;s and Hudson&rsquo;s
alignment project even more implausible.</p>

<p>
Nelkin (2000, 565&ndash;566) sees Anomalous Monism as offering a
failed solution to a problem about rationality raised by Kant. The
problem is that the faculty of reason produces both the belief in
freedom, and thus lack of determinism, regarding our actions (which is
required in order to engage in deliberation), and also the belief in
determinism about <em>all</em> events, thus including our actions.
But these appear to be contradictory beliefs, entailing that reason,
as their source, is inherently irrational. Nelkin sees Anomalous
Monism as offering a &ldquo;non-contradictory contents&rdquo; solution
to this problem, in order to exonerate reason from the charge of
irrationality. On her understanding, the apparently conflicting
beliefs concern actions as considered under different descriptions
&ndash; mental and physical. This relativity of the beliefs to these
different descriptions cancels the appearance of contradiction between
them. For while the beliefs are not about different <em>things</em>
or <em>events</em> (this is what the two-worlds interpretation of
Transcendental Idealism holds), they do concern
different <em>properties</em> of events. The contents of the belief
that actions are free when described psychologically and the belief
that actions are not free when described physically are therefore
significantly different, and thus they cannot contradict each
other. This much seems right as an interpretation of Anomalous
Monism.</p>

<p>
Nelkin, however, rejects this as a solution to Kant&rsquo;s problem of rationality. She assumes that if an event is determined, it is determined no matter how it is described (Nelkin 2000, 565), which effectively nullifies the relativization-to-descriptions move. With this assumption in hand, she then argues that Anomalous Monism cannot avoid the entailment that <em>actions are (events that are) determined</em> because Davidson&rsquo;s monism states that they are identical to physical events, and Davidson&rsquo;s cause-law principle insists that physical events are determined. And now we have a straightforward contradiction with the belief in freedom, which holds that <em>actions are not determined</em>. Therefore no reconciliation has actually been achieved between the belief in freedom and the belief in determinism. If this is right, then Anomalous Monism is powerless to exonerate reason from the charge of irrationality.</p>

<p>
However, this criticism is based on a widespread and pernicious
misunderstanding of Anomalous Monism. As noted in 
 <a href="index-2.html#ArgForAnoMon">1</a>, on
Davidson&rsquo;s view it is <em>causal</em> relations that are
extensional, not <em>deterministic</em> relations. Events that are
causally related are so no matter how they&rsquo;re
described. Determinism, however, attaches to
physical <em>descriptions</em> of events, not to the events themselves
(Davidson 1970, 215). When events are described physically they can be
related by strict law and thus can be deterministically related. But
when events are described psychologically, though they can
be <em>causally</em> related (2.2), they cannot
be <em>deterministically</em> related. For according to mental
anomalism, there are no strict psychological or psychophysical laws
covering such descriptions. So Nelkin cannot assume that if an event
is determined, it is determined no matter how it is described. And
thus her subsequent argument that Anomalous Monism yields
contradictory beliefs concerning freedom and determinism lapses. In
particular, without that assumption in place, Anomalous
Monism <em>cannot</em> be taken to entail, from the facts that mental
events are identical to physical events (monism) and that physical
events stand in deterministic relations (the cause-law principle),
that mental events stand in deterministic relations.</p>

<p>
Moreover, if deterministic relations <em>were</em> assumed to be
extensional, this would undermine both the structure and possibility
of Anomalous Monism generally as well as Nelkin&rsquo;s own subsequent
argument for its failure to solve the rationality problem in
particular. For if physical events are determined (the cause-law
principle) and mental events causally interact with physical events
(the interaction principle), then the extensionality of deterministic
relations would entail that mental events determine and are determined
by physical events &ndash; which would require the existence of strict
psychophysical laws. This would entail the falsity of mental
anomalism. And without mental anomalism there could be no argument for
monism. So Anomalous Monism would collapse entirely. Morever, these
results would block Nelkin&rsquo;s subsequent argument for the beliefs
about freedom and determinism contradicting each other, which depends
crucially on an assumption of monism. Taken together, these points
show why deterministic relations cannot be assumed to be extensional
within the framework of Anomalous Monism. And they expose an essential
incoherence in Nelkin&rsquo;s argumentative strategy: with the assumption in
place, she can&rsquo;t derive the conclusion she wants, which depends
on monism; and without that assumption, she can&rsquo;t even begin to
formulate her objection.  Within the framework of Anomalous Monism,
therefore, the belief in freedom and the belief in determinism are
consistent, and reason is exonerated of the charge of irrationality in
producing both of these beliefs. (Nelkin&rsquo;s confusion here
belongs to a tradition going back at least to Honderich 1982. For
discussion, see 
 <a href="mental-properties.html">Mental Properties and Causal Relevance</a>. 
 This type of
confusion underlies many of the epiphenomenalist objections to
Anomalous Monism 
 (<a href="index-2.html#EpiObj">6</a>).)</p>

<p>
We began this discussion by noting Davidson&rsquo;s own invocation of
Kant on the thesis of mental anomalism, its status as a precondition
for freedom, and monism. On the two-descriptions view of
Transcendental Idealism, it initially can seem plausible to see in
Davidson&rsquo;s monism and mental anomalism a model for making sense
of Kant&rsquo;s picture: described physically, a person is subject to
strict physical laws, and his behavior can be deterministically
predicted; described mentally, a person&rsquo;s thoughts and actions
are not subject to strict psychological or psychophysical laws and
thus can be seen as free. However, as we have seen, this initial
appearance of isomorphism masks over difficult issues, in particular
about the role of psychological causation in Davidson&rsquo;s and
Kant&rsquo;s pictures and the place of psychology more generally in
the empirical world for each. And, as we are about to see, there are
other questions about the connection between mental anomalism and
freedom that further complicate initial appearances concerning the
relation between them.</p>

<h4 id="AnomMoniContComp">3.2 Anomalous Monism and Contemporary Compatibilism</h4>

<p>
Within contemporary discussions of compatibilism there are several
competing positions concerning the relationship between mental
anomalism and freedom (understood hereafter in its morally relevant
sense). As noted earlier, there is the very strong intuition, which
Davidson shares, that mental anomalism is necessary for freedom. It
should be noted that the intuition here is supposed to concern freedom
in particular, and not merely generic action. As we&rsquo;ve seen in
 <a href="index-2.html#RatArg">4.2</a>, 
 Davidson holds that anomalism is necessary for action because of
the connection between rationality and action-explanation. But the
present intuition concerns <em>free</em> action in particular. The
claim is that anomalism is a key explanatory, necessary condition
for <em>free</em> action. The distinction between merely intentional
and free action will be important in the discussion below. </p>

<p>
The few explicit discussions of the relationship between Anomalous
Monism and freedom in the contemporary literature fail to recognize
this distinction or its importance in assessing that relationship.
They assume that the relationship turns entirely on the ability
(Glannon 1997, sections 4&ndash;5) or inability (de Caro 2020, section 2) of
Anomalous Monism to account for the causal relevance of mental
properties (see 
 <a href="index-2.html#EpiObj">6</a> and
 <a href="mental-properties.html">Mental Properties and Causal Relevance</a>). 
 De Caro
2020 goes so far as to assert that, for Davidson, free actions simply
are those that are non-deviantly caused by an agent&rsquo;s mental
states. The fault here owes in part to Davidson&rsquo;s very
misleading discussion in Davidson 1973.  Davidson there defends the
idea that an agent is &ldquo;free to act&rdquo; if he can act
intentionally, which itself is analyzed causally in terms of the
agent&rsquo;s primary reasons causing (in the right way) his
actions. But being &ldquo;free to act&rdquo; is not the same thing as
&ldquo;acting freely&rdquo;. Being free to act, as Davidson is
discussing it, means being <em>able</em> to act (Davidson 1973, 63 and
79 is clear about this). But clearly we are <em>able</em> to perform
actions that are <em>not free</em> (see Frankfurt 1971, Watson
1975). As noted below, actions that are the result of coercive forces,
including brainwashing, hypnosis, or addiction are (depending on
context) often not assessed as free in the sense relevant to
responsibility even though they are
nonetheless <em>actions</em>. Davidson&rsquo;s discussion of &ldquo;freedom
to act&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t account for such cases at all. In this respect,
his account of &ldquo;freedom to act&rdquo; is simply a defense of the
idea that intentional action, and in particular the ability to act,
has a causal analysis. And both acting intentionally and the ability
to act are consistent with not acting freely. As we will see, this gap
between intentional and free action creates problems for
Davidson&rsquo;s claim that mental anomalism is a key necessary
condition for freedom.</p>

<p>
The intuition that mental anomalism is necessary for freedom is typically based on the thought
that if one&rsquo;s action or choice is exceptionlessly predictable,
then one lacks control over it: it will occur no matter what, and is
thus inconsistent with the idea that one could have done or chosen
otherwise. There are two distinct claims involved here. The first is
that the ability to do or choose otherwise is necessary for freedom.
The second is that strict laws are inconsistent with the ability to do
or choose otherwise. However, there are compatibilist positions that
highlight the denial of one or the other of these claims. As discussed
below, Davidson himself rejects the first claim for reasons deeply
connected to his theory of action-explanation, agreeing with Harry
Frankfurt&rsquo;s well-known views (Davison 1973b, 75; Frankfurt
1969). This would seem to make the second issue irrelevant in a
discussion of Anomalous Monism, since it depends on a notion that
Davidson rejects. And Davidson has taken no position on the debate,
generated by Lewis 1981, van Inwagen 1984, Fischer 1986 and others
concerning whether determinism is actually inconsistent with the ability to do
or choose otherwise. However, as we will see, Davidson&rsquo;s embrace
of Frankfurt&rsquo;s view actually calls into question
Davidson&rsquo;s claim that mental anomalism is required for freedom. Davidson is trying to combine a backward-looking, <em>historicist</em> conception of freedom &mdash; the idea that the history of an agent&rsquo;s action is relevant to its status as free &mdash; with a rejection of the traditional forward-looking requirement of alternative possibilities. And as we will see below, there are hard questions about the coherence of this combination. Though there has been no clear recognition of this point in the literature on either Anomalous Monism or freedom, we will see that it
cuts to the very heart of the most central issue in the metaphysics of
freedom. As argued below, in order to make sense of the intuition that
the status of strict psychological and psychophysical laws is relevant
to freedom, one must hold that the ability to do or choose otherwise
is necessary for freedom. This doesn&rsquo;t decide the compatibilism
question, but it does push to the fore the second issue distinguished
above: whether and how the ability to do or choose otherwise is
consistent with determinism.</p>

<p>
Compatibilists starting with Hume and more recently Frankfurt have
argued that the ability to do otherwise is not necessary for the sort
of freedom that we care about, which tracks moral responsibility (Hume
1748 [1993], section VIII; Frankfurt 1969). Frankfurt discusses cases
where agents lack the ability to do otherwise than A because a
coercive force will kick in if the agent chooses or begins to choose
to do otherwise than A, guaranteeing that the agent A&rsquo;s. He
argues that our intuitions show that such an agent nonetheless can be
held morally responsible for her actual action of A&rsquo;ing. These
intuitions derive from the fact that the agent performed the action
because she wanted to and so wasn&rsquo;t in fact coerced in any
relevant sense. Davidson shares these intuitions, and notes that they
flow directly from his account of rationalizing explanations, which
highlight actions as <em>intentional</em> &ndash; as described from the
agent&rsquo;s point of view in terms of his reasons (Davidson 1973b,
75). He notes that in the cases that Frankfurt imagines, there is
overdetermination of a certain kind (a certain result A is causally
guaranteed), but this overdetermination masks over an important,
freedom-relevant distinction between intentionally and
non-intentionally described actions. If the coercive force were to in
fact kick in, the resulting action wouldn&rsquo;t be intentional. It
is intentional only under the description of doing it because one
wants to. It is this intentionality that ascriptions of
responsibility, and thus freedom, are, at least in part (see discussion below), tracking (here Davidson
anticipates the discussion in Fischer 1994, chapter 7).</p>

<p>
Incompatibilists have responded to this line of argument against the
requirement of alternative possibilities for responsibility-relevant
freedom. They claim that the cases that Frankfurt imagines aren&rsquo;t
counterexamples to a properly formulated version of the alternative
possibility requirement that drives incompatibilist intuitions: an
agent freely A&rsquo;s only if she could have <em>chosen</em>, or <em>begun to choose</em>,
not to A (Widerker 1995; Fischer 1994, chapter 7). The point is that
the basic incompatibilist intuition about determinism is that it rules
out the possibility of alternative possible <em>choices</em>. In the
Frankfurt example, the agent can&rsquo;t perform a different <em>action</em>, but she <em>can</em> choose, or begin to choose, to do otherwise (at which point the coercive force would kick in, producing the guaranteed but now coerced and thus exculpated action). The incompatibilist claim is that it is the  existence of this alternative possible choice in Frankfurt&rsquo;s example that explains why we hold the agent morally responsible. It manifests a &ldquo;flicker of freedom&rdquo; (Fischer 1994, chapter 7) and entails that there is no relevant determinism in the example. And if determinism is built into the example in order to prevent the occurrence of choosing, or beginning to choose otherwise than A, then incompatibilists deny any inclination to hold the agent responsible. Many philosophers now believe, and Frankfurt 2003
appears to have conceded, that there is no clear counterexample to
this formulation of the incompatibilist intuition. However, Frankfurt
insists that a distinction underlying his example &ndash; between causation
and explanation &ndash; is sufficient to show that the incompatibilist
requirement of alternative possibilities is nonetheless mistaken.
There is a key conceptual difference between making an action
unavoidable (which causal determinism appears to guarantee) and
bringing it about that an action is performed. Ascriptions of
responsibility-relevant freedom track, at least in part, the latter &ndash; they track
how an agent was led to perform the action she performed, and this
concerns whether the action was or was not intentional. This is a
point that goes back to Hume&rsquo;s classic presentation of
compatibilism and rejection of the need for alternative possible
actions: it is not <em>whether</em>, but instead <em>how</em> an
action is determined that is relevant to responsibility-relevant
freedom. If the action is determined by the agent&rsquo;s wants (or,
as with later compatibilist views, endorsed wants (Frankfurt 1971), or
wants consistent with his values (Watson 1975)), then the agent acts
intentionally, and thus meets a necessary condition for responsibility-relevant freedom. Davidson
would certainly agree with this general point, subject to the
difficulties, discussed in 
 <a href="index-2.html#MenCau">2.2</a> and 
 <a href="index-2.html#PreIIIAnoPri">4</a>, 
concerning spelling out what it is to be
caused <em>in the right way</em>.</p>

<p>
To the objection that one&rsquo;s wanting to A may itself be
determined in coercive fashion, compatibilists in this tradition have
developed, in different ways, the core thought that what matters to
freedom is the agent&rsquo;s relationship to his wants. If the agent
endorses those wants, or they are consistent with his values, then the
fact that the wants might be determined is simply irrelevant to
freedom considerations. Frankfurt himself has gone so far as to argue
that a creature that was designed and created to have wants would be
freely acting on them to the extent that he was designed to
wholeheartedly endorse them (Frankfurt 1975, section III). On this <em>ahistoricist</em>
view, the history of a creature&rsquo;s mental properties is
irrelevant to assignments of freedom; what matters is the
agent&rsquo;s mental structure at the time of action. This is opposed to <em>historicist</em> views (see Fischer and Ravizza 1994 and 1998) which hold that possible coercive sources of such mental structures would undermine freedom and responsibility. Frankfurt explicitly rejects such historicist views, insisting that meeting the appropriate conditions for mental structure (wholehearted indentification; see Frankfurt 1987) leaves no room for concerns about coercive and thus freedom-undermining sources. Watson 2004,
section III heavily emphasizes this point, arguing that a defensible
compatibilism &ndash; a <em>hard</em> compatibilism &ndash; ultimately depends on rejecting any historicist freedom-relevant
distinction between purposeful determination (deriving, coercively, from other
agents) and merely natural determination. Otherwise, a door is left
open that inevitably leads to incompatibilism, because only a concern
about control could drive such a distinction, and determinism is
ultimately incompatible with control. And control is precisely what is
at issue in requiring alternative possible actions or choices for
freedom.</p>

<p>
The important point here is that the existence of strict
psychological or psychophysical laws, on Frankfurt&rsquo;s and
Watson&rsquo;s view, is not only entirely consistent with freedom; a
defensible compatibilism actually depends on holding this. And this
point is closely tied to rejecting the requirement of alternative
possibilities for freedom. For that requirement naturally pairs with concerns about determinism, and thus mental anomalism (see further discussion below). But once one rejects the requirement, the history of the mental structure that leads to action, including its nomic status, becomes irrelevant to whether the action is free and culpable. On their view, Davidson&rsquo;s position
ultimately is incoherent in attempting to combine an historicist, backward-looking concern about the nomic status of conditions leading to action with the rejection of the traditional historicist, forward-looking requirement of alternative possibilities. Moreover, once <em>either</em> of these historicist components is embraced, compatibilism collapses under the weight of incompatibilist concerns about control. (The well known historicist account of responsibility developed in Fischer and Ravizza 1994 and 1998 is subject to related objections.)</p>

<p>
A more direct way to question Davidson&rsquo;s attempt to
maintain the relevance of mental anomalism to freedom while rejecting
the requirement of alternative possibilities is to ask the following
question: why should one <em>care</em> if one&rsquo;s actions or
choices are or are not exceptionlessly predictable by strict laws if
one holds that alternative possibilities aren&rsquo;t required for
freedom? There is no clear answer to this question, and it certainly
isn&rsquo;t self-evident that it should matter. The fact that
one&rsquo;s action or choice is inevitable is threatening to
one&rsquo;s sense of freedom only, it would seem, if one thinks that one thereby
cannot do or choose otherwise. Interestingly, this same point can be
made about Derk Pereboom&rsquo;s striking claim that the
&ldquo;fundamental incompatibilist intuition&rdquo; which makes determinism threatening to freedom isn&rsquo;t the forward-looking claim that determinism (i.e. the
existence of strict laws) rules out alternative possibilities, but
rather the backward-looking claim that determinism entails that
one&rsquo;s actions trace back to causal factors in the distant past
beyond one&rsquo;s control (Pereboom 1995, 257; Pereboom 2001, Chapter 1; Glannon 1997, 220, makes a similar claim). Pereboom, like
Davidson, aims to support Frankfurt&rsquo;s rejection of the need for
alternative possible actions or choices for freedom while nonetheless
maintaining the relevance of the existence of deterministic laws for
our sense of freedom. Like Davidson, Pereboom&rsquo;s position entails that a denial of strict psychophysical laws is the key necessary and explanatory condition for freedom. And like Davidson, Pereboom provides no answer to the question
of why one should <em>care</em> about the fact that one&rsquo;s
actions trace back to causal factors in the distant past beyond
one&rsquo;s control, why this should seem to threaten our sense of
freedom, once the requirement of alternative possibilities is rejected. He appears to take its significance as self-evident. But it is
not.</p>

<p>
The conclusion to be drawn is that if one takes mental anomalism
(and, more generally, the status of determinism) to be relevant to
freedom, than one must accept some version of the principle of
alternative possibilities rejected by Frankfurt, and thus one must
take a stand on how or whether that principle is compatible with the
cause-law principle, which is the expression of determinism within
Anomalous Monism. Historicism about freedom naturally goes together with the requirement of alternative possibilities. There are a number of options for articulating a
compatibilist conception of the ability to do or choose otherwise,
including acting or choosing otherwise in relevantly similar
circumstances (for a sophisticated account along these lines see Smith 2003), or in a world with slightly different laws or pasts
(Lewis 1981, Fischer 1986.) The point here is simply that one owes
some such account if one holds that mental anomalism is relevant to
freedom. And one must subsequently confront the question of whether this type of view can withstand the general incompatibilist concerns about control that, according to hard compatibilism, inevitably lead to the collapse of historicist compatibilism. One can, alternatively, go Frankfurt&rsquo;s and Watson&rsquo;s full ahistoricist, hard compatibilist route and
reject both the relevance of determinism to freedom and the need for
alternative possibilities.</p>

<p>
Given Davidson&rsquo;s rejection of the requirement of alternative
possibilities, where do things stand with his general claim that
mental anomalism is required for freedom? As noted above, it is clear
that mental anomalism is required, on Davidson&rsquo;s view, for
intentional actions, because these are structured by rationalizing
explanations, and rationality is, as we&rsquo;ve seen, integral to the
argument for mental anomalism. But while intentional action is
necessary for free action, it is not sufficient. And Davidson is
claiming that mental anomalism is a key necessary <em>and
explanatory</em> condition for freedom in particular. (As discussed
above in 
 <a href="#MenAnoSemExt">Related Issues: 2. Mental Anomalism and Semantic Externalism</a>,
 Davidson 1987a, 443&ndash;44 has, independently, insisted on an historicist
conception of semantic properties in arguing that a being that
emerged <em>ex nihilo</em> who was physically identical with an
existing person could not be attributed any mental states or
linguistic meanings, and their behavior subsequently could not be
described intentionally, because semantic content depends on a being&rsquo;s
causal history of interaction with its environment, and this creature
has no such history. This historicist requirement, once again, has
nothing in particular to do with freedom.) But without the traditional
appeal to alternative possibilities, mental anomalism does not appear
to bear any such explanatory relation to the status of actions
as <em>free</em>. The problem results from Davidson&rsquo;s failure to fill in the gap between intentional and free action. The traditional view fills this gap with the requirement of alternative possible actions or choices. That requirement explains why mental anomalism is necessary for freedom because mental anomalism allows, in some form, for such alternative possibilities relative to the threat of physical determinism. Frankfurt&rsquo;s and Watson&rsquo;s views fill the gap with conditions regarding motivational structure that, they argue, remove the need for the requirement of alternative possibilities, and thus have no need to impose conditions regarding determinism, whether physical or psychophysical. With nothing to fill the gap, and a commitment to the rejection of the requirement of alternative possibilities, Davidson is left with nothing to motivate a requirement of mental anomalism for freedom.</p>

<p>
Let us return to the basic picture of action offered to us by
Anomalous Monism. As already noted, on Davidson&rsquo;s view, strict
physical laws determine that one&rsquo;s arm will go up on a
particular occasion, and this bodily movement can, in principle, be
exceptionlessly predicted. However, mental anomalism entails that
whether that rising of the arm is token-identical to a raising of
one&rsquo;s arm &ndash; an intentional action &ndash; is not something
that can be predicted exceptionlessly. Complete knowledge of physical
law cannot decide whether the rising of an arm is an arm-raising, and
a free one at that. Whatever the factors are that go into deciding
this, Davidson is clear that they don&rsquo;t require the ability to
do or choose otherwise. The kind of freedom made room for by Anomalous
Monism, on its own, appears only to be freedom with respect to whether
one&rsquo;s arm going up is an instance of one&rsquo;s intentionally
raising one&rsquo;s arm. As argued above, this is not an intuitive
or adequate conception of what freedom consists in, since free action goes beyond mere intentional action. Finally, there
needs to be some explanation provided of why it is that what we intend
to do so often coincides with the occurrence of appropriate bodily
movement that is determined by physical law and so going to happen
anyway (see Pereboom 1995, section III for related discussion.)
Without some such explanation, free action can only appear to be an
inexplicable miracle. This is a manifestation of the miraculous
coincidence problem discussed in

<h2>Early Attempts to Solve the Socratic Problem</h2>

<p>
Proposed solutions to the Socratic problem that could provide
reasonable explanations of inconsistencies in Plato&rsquo;s dialogues
were ready at hand as far back as the eighteenth century (Thesleff
2009). Residue from the four identified here, with a few variations,
are found in the assumptions of the twentieth century&rsquo;s proposed
solutions as well. Likewise, the problems with each are as alive now
as they were long ago.</p>

<ol>

<li>The real Socrates is the one whose qualities in Plato are
corroborated by Aristophanes and Xenophon.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This view could not yield much because there was too little direct
overlap among the three extant sources. Later, but on the same
historical assumption, there were similar attempts to find the real
Socrates by identifying views that showed progress beyond extant
presocratic views, e.g., those of Heraclitus and Parmenides, the
Pythagoreans, Xenophanes, and Anaxagoras.</p>

<ol start="2">

<li>The real Socrates is the one who claims no wisdom but exercises
his skill at <em>seeking</em> understanding, thus the one depicted in
dialogues that end inconclusively or at an impasse (i.e., in
<em>aporia</em> &mdash; literally, without resources), without a clear
indication of how the initial questions should be answered or even
what the next step in the discussion should be.</li>
</ol>

<p>
At first, this seemed to promise that the real Socrates was described
in such dialogues as <em>Charmides</em>, <em>Laches</em>,
<em>Lysis</em>, and <em>Euthyphro</em>. Over time, however, positive
doctrines were identified in all of the ones that had at first seemed
aporetic, despite their inconclusive ends. Also, it was problematic
that significant works such as <em>Crito</em> and <em>Apology</em>
which seemed, at least to some scholars, to be historically plausible,
were omitted under this criterion. What is more, <em>Theaetetus</em>,
often cited as ushering in the late <em>Statesman</em> and
<em>Sophist</em>, ends in apparent <em>aporia</em>.</p>

<ol start="3">

<li>The real Socrates is the one who appears in Plato&rsquo;s earliest
dialogues.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The problem was to find a non-circular way to determine which
dialogues were earliest. The only secure piece of information about
the order of Plato&rsquo;s dialogues available from ancient times was
that <em>Republic</em> was written before <em>Laws</em>; and that was
not nearly enough information to support a full-fledged chronology of
dates of composition, especially because so many dialogues were
assumed to have been composed before <em>Republic</em>. Two important
attempts to introduce appropriate criteria followed.</p>

<p>
(3a) Stylometrics (the measument of aspects of Plato&rsquo;s conscious
and unconscious writing style) contributed hundreds of articles
purporting to show which dialogues were early. However, proponents of
stylometry could not overcome the circularity problem: every suggested
order depended on first positing an early, i.e.,
pre-<em>Republic</em>, exemplar for which no independent confirmation
was possible. In fact, the first non-circular effort (Ledger 1989) was
possible only after computers enabled the measurement and correlation
of very large numbers of stylistic features; but then the results did
<em>not</em> confirm scholars&rsquo; expectations about the order of
the dialogues. More nuanced contemporary stylometric research is
closely related to Plato&rsquo;s skill at changing registers to evoke
different characters, an approach that sometimes identifies affinities
in clusters of dialogues (e.g. Tarrant 2022).</p>

<p>
Another effort took literally the suggestion that such formulaic
expressions as &ldquo;I said&rdquo; and &ldquo;he agreed&rdquo; should
give way to direct speech (suggested at <em>Theaetetus</em> 143b3). By
this criterion, all dialogues with direct speech were to be counted as
later than <em>Theaetetus</em>. However, the criterion foundered on
the exceptions: <em>Laches</em>, for example, would have to be
post-<em>Theaetetus</em> while, by all other criteria deemed relevant,
it was written early in Plato&rsquo;s career. And <em>Timaeus</em>,
seeming so late, would have to be recategorized as
pre-<em>Theaetetus</em>. To complicate matters, several dialogues mix
the dramatic and narrative styles, and some manuscripts imply revision
of style.</p>

<p>
(3b) Thematic development was supposed to demonstrate that
Plato&rsquo;s views evolved over time on specific philosophical issues
and that the order in which the dialogues were written could be
determined by placing the least evolved first. Two insurmountable
problems arose: the particular view considered most highly evolved
depended entirely on the preferred views of the scholars who performed
the investigations; moreover, when longer dialogues containing more
than one subject were compared (e.g., <em>Republic</em> and
<em>Symposium</em>), it often occurred that a dialogue would be highly
evolved on one subject and introductory on a second subject, while the
other dialogue would have the reverse configuration, leaving no
obvious way to distinguish which was earlier.</p>

<ol start="4">

<li>The real Socrates is the one who turns from the presocratic
interest in nature to ethics, and has no theory of separate forms
(loosely based on Aristotle, <em>Metaphysics</em> 987b1&ndash;6).</li>
</ol>

<p>
The difficulty arises that forms appear to be implicit even in the
dialogues that, by all other criteria, would be considered early
(e.g., <em>Euthyphro</em>, cf. Allen 1971). In addition, when
<em>specific</em> ethical issues later came to be identified, the old
difficulties of (3b) reappeared with respect to the views taken to be
those of Socrates. Some scholars have been reluctant to concede that
Socrates toyed with forms as a young man and that, even then, forms
may not have been novel but a clever step that more than one
philosopher took to overcome Parmenidean problems with motion and
change (<em>Parmenides</em> 130b).</p>

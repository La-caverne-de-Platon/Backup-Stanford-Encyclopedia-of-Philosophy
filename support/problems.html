<h1>The Problems With a Traditional Funding Model</h1>

<p>
 The SEP project has reasons for continuing as a self-publishing
academic project and for avoiding a long-term funding solution,
possibly in alliance with an publisher, that is based on ongoing
annual subscriptions that lock out non-subscribers. We note first that
the only thing an alliance with a publisher would bring to the SEP
project would be expertise on how to market and collect money; we have
already developed the expertise needed to publish a dynamic reference
work on the web.</p>

<p> 
Our reasons for avoiding a subscription-based funding model (or
alliance with a publisher) are based on the severe problems that would
occur if such a plan were implemented:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#new-costs">our costs would increase</a></li>
<li><a href="#loss-impact">our impact would be reduced</a></li>
<li><a href="#no-guarantee">our future would be compromised</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
We consider each of these problems in turn.</p>

<h2><a id="new-costs">Our costs would increase</a></h2>

<p> Our best estimate is that an alliance with a commercial or
academic publisher would at least double, if not triple, our
costs, given the following new expenses which we would incur:</p>

<ol>
 <li>We would have to start paying our authors and subject editors,
since reference works published by commercial and academic presses
standardly make such payments. Our authors and editors no doubt
deserve payment for their efforts, but our working hypothesis has been
that as long as the SEP remains free and highly visible, they will see
their volunteer labor as being personally rewarding as well as a
contribution to the public good.</li>
 <li>We would have to start paying our mirror sites. These sites
provide faster world-wide access, offer extra layers of digital
preservation, and offer uninterrupted 24/7 service on those rare
occasions the Stanford server is down for maintenance.</li>
 <li>We would incur marketing, distribution, and income collection
costs, and the costs of the extra personnel and managers needed to
implement those processes.</li>
 <li>We would incur costs required to support the customer service
demands of libraries paying annual subscriptions.</li>
 <li>An alliance with a publisher might force the project to move
off-campus, and as a result, we would incur extra costs above and
beyond the 6.5% overhead associated with running the project at
Stanford, such as more expensive office space, backup systems (which
CSLI now covers), repair (which the Stanford Bookstore does more
cheaply than on the outside), and local IT/networking support (which
is now provided at CSLI).</li>
 </ol>

<h2><a id="loss-impact">Our impact would be reduced</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Restricting access to subscribers only would obviously
disenfranchise many deserving scholarly groups including students and
faculty at smaller universities or colleges, independent scholars
using an internet service provider at home, students and teachers at
K-12 institutions, scholars and students in many parts of the world,
indeed anyone at institutions too poor to pay the institutional
subscription and any individuals too poor to pay personal
subscriptions.  Clearly, the SEP would cease to achieve its goal of
bringing the best in philosophical scholarship to the wider public.</li>

<li>The fact that search engines would be blocked from
accessing SEP pages would mean that the SEP would disappear from the
results returned by those search engines, dropping it to a level of
invisibility comparable to the commercially-published Routledge
Encyclopedia of Philosophy and further curtailing the ability of
readers to find the SEP.  75% of the SEP's readership finds
it by way of a web search.</li>

<li>Even if there were some way of allowing search engines to
index its restricted-access site, the effect of blocking
non-subscribers from the SEP would result in a precipitous drop in the
number of links to the SEP pages, and a corresponding drop in
search-engine rankings. Google rankings are
based upon the number of links from other websites, so the SEP's high
rank is a function of the number of links that point to the SEP.
Google may not remain the premier search engine, but the techniques it
uses to identify relevant pages to a search will surely be
incorporated and enhanced by any successors.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a id="no-guarantee">Our future would be compromised</a></h2>

<p>
 In addition to these consequences, there is the question as to
whether this model can sustain itself.  The overriding fact which
confronts any attempt to fund the SEP with annual subscriptions (or
indeed any other reference work in the humanities) is this: the
<em>commercial market</em> (i.e., those with the ability to pay
significant <em>ongoing</em> and increasing subscription costs) for
philosophy (humanities) reference works is very small.  To complicate
matters in the case of the SEP, there is already one commercial online
reference work in philosophy (Routledge) with a presence in that
market.</p>

<p> 
 In view of the small market, the subscription model would
therefore have to resort to other income-producing mechanisms, such as
advertisements and selling sponsored links in the entries.  Of course,
these other mechanisms will require personnel to market to advertisers
and to develop contracts with sponsors. So there are costs involved
here as well.  Moreover, such income-producing mechanisms may
compromise the academic appearance and integrity of the encyclopedia.
Readers might start to wonder whether a book was listed in an entry
because the author of the entry found it valuable or because someone
paid the SEP to include it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
 The above results all combine in pernicious ways, with the result
being that a subscription-based funding model would lead the SEP
project towards a situation where it loses it focus and character as a
project developed, administered and maintained by academics.  Not only
would the SEP reach a tiny fraction of the audience it once reached,
but it might be forced to scramble each year to make ends meet,
distracting its central staff from the academic mission of enhancing
the encyclopedia's content and technological underpinnings.  By
contrast, if its basic operations and growth were covered by an
endowment, the SEP staff could focus their fund-raising efforts on
innovative grant proposals (taking advantage of their location at the
Center for the Study of Language and Information) to push the
technological limits of humanities computing, providing benefits to
scholars and other readers in the form of improved navigation
interfaces which are sensitive both to meanings and to the conceptual
structure of the entire encyclopedia.</p>

<p>
  Thus, the SEP will best accomplish its mission only if it offers
completely open access to its content and retains its character as a
self-publishing academic project run by people with the required
technological skills.</p>

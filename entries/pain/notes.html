 Although the acceptance is not universal, the remaining controversy
seems to relate to its formulation and details, not to its substance.
Indeed even those who have been critical of this definition consider
it to be an important advance over a conception of pain that the
<em>Note</em>, appended to the main definition, warns against. For
critical discussion see Melzack (1988), Price (1988, 1999), Fields
(1999), Hardcastle (1999). Aydede (2017a) critically surveys the
debates surrounding the IASP definition and defends it against
criticisms. The term &lsquo;nociceptor&rsquo; used in the definition
refers to free nerve endings under the skin or innervating other kinds
of body or organ tissue that contain receptors relatively specialized
to respond to certain forms of noxious (harmful) stimuli.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>
 Such syndromes are not restricted to chronic pains felt in phantom
limbs after an accident or amputation, nor to referred pains such as
feeling pain in one&rsquo;s left arm due to a heart condition. 40% of all
Americans suffer from chronic pains at least once in their lives
&mdash; there are more that 1500 pain clinics in the US alone devoted
to treat such cases and other pain syndromes such as cancer pain. A
great portion of these are due to some pathology in the peripheral
afferent nerves, or more typically, centrally caused pains (i.e.,
feeling pain in a particular body region caused by the central nervous
system when there is nothing physically wrong in that region). In such
cases even though there may be nothing physically wrong in the bodily
location where the pain is felt, there is obviously something wrong
(or at least, different) with the neural mechanisms that generate such
experiences &mdash; but this is a different matter. Certain forms of
allodynia and hyperalgesia can also be classified under this
phenomenon.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>
 Indeed some of my students regularly say this when I teach this
material and press the question on them really hard. Nevertheless, it
is important to note that what follows is shear speculation and should
not be taken as part of common sense &mdash; indeed it&rsquo;s not.
Commonsense seems content with harbouring the tension between the two
threads embedded in it.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>
 The term &lsquo;intransitive&rsquo; is from Armstrong (1962, 1968).
Armstrong contrast these with &lsquo;transitive&rsquo; bodily
sensations such as feeling the temperature or smoothness of an object,
where the experience has a straightforward non-mental perceptual
object.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>
 Broad (1959) defends one of the most sophisticated versions of a
sense-datum theory. Interestingly, however, pains and aches, according
to Broad, are less amenable to an act-object analysis. He writes: </p>

<blockquote>
It is by no means obvious that a sensation of headache involves an act
of sensing and a &lsquo;headachy&rsquo; object; on the contrary, it
seems on the whole more plausible to describe the whole experience as
a &lsquo;headachy&rsquo; state of mind. In fact the distinction of act
and object seems here to have vanished; and, as there is clearly
<em>something</em> mental in feeling a headache, just as there is in
sensing a red patch, it seems plausible to hold that a sensation of
headache is an unanalyzable mental fact, within which no distinction
of act and object can be found. (1959, pp. 254&ndash;55)
</blockquote>

<p>
Perhaps this is so with headaches and other aches that are
spatiotemporally very diffuse. But it is not clear whether it is
indeed more plausible to make the same claim about acute pains that
are temporally and spatially well delineated, such as a sudden jabbing
pain in the back of one&rsquo;s right hand or a pain caused by a pinprick in
one&rsquo;s left thigh, etc.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 Jackson&rsquo;s (1976, 1977) is an unabashed and technically sophisticated
defense of a sense-datum view in general and of pains in particular.
See also Addis (1986) for a similar line. Jackson no longer defends a
sense-datum theory: he has recently rejected anti-physicalism and
accepted a physicalistic representationalist view similar to the one
we will discuss below. See Jackson (1998).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>
 H. H. Price (1950) seems to defend this sort of view. He introduces
the notion of a &lsquo;sense-field&rsquo; according to which
&ldquo;sense-data, though they have places in their own sense-fields,
are <em>nowhere</em>&rdquo; (p. 248). However, Price does not treat
pains as sense-data on their own, but rather as &ldquo;outstanding
parts of a sense-datum (namely, of the total somatic one) which
display a particularly striking sort of sensible qualities&rdquo; (p.
232). For Price, when it comes to somatic sensations and feelings,
there is only one sense-datum with its own unique somatic sense-field
such that all bodily feelings and sensations are qualifications or
modifications of it.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>
 Perkins (1983) is not a sense-datum theorists, although he is an
indirect realist. He dispenses with phenomenal objects in favor of
phenomenal qualities that one&rsquo;s experience instantiates or somehow
incorporates. But he still takes the act-object model to be the proper
analysis of sensory experience except that the act is now directed
toward not a mental <em>object</em> but rather an instance of a
<em>quality</em>. Thus, not all indirect realist theories are
sense-data theories, but this subtlety, although important for some
purposes, won&rsquo;t make a difference for what follows &mdash; but
see Sections 3.1 and 3.5 below.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>
 Other perceptual theorists (in the direct realist tradition) include
McKenzie (1968), Wilkes (1977), Fleming (1976), Graham and Stephens
(1985) and Stephens and Graham (1987), Newton (1989), Hardcastle
(1997; 1999). For criticisms of some early perceptual views of pain,
see Vesey (1964a, 1964b), Margolis (1976), Mayberry (1978, 1979),
Everitt (1988), and Grahek (1991). Grice (1962) had already argued
that there is a fundamental distinction between bodily sensations and
standard perception. See Armstrong (1964), and Pitcher (1978) for
replies to some of these criticisms. Holborow (1969) and Pitcher
(1969) are criticisms of another perceptual theorist&rsquo;s work, McKenzie
(1968), who claims that &lsquo;pain can be accepted as a sense in the
way in which smell is a sense&rsquo; (p. 189). For a recent and quite
radical defense of a perceptual view of pain, see Hill (2004, 2006,
2009).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>
 In what follows, it is useful to denote concepts by capitalized words
that name them. So, for instance, &lsquo;RED&rsquo; denotes the
concept of red which in turn expresses the property of being red. In
other words, RED expresses the property of being red, or
<em>redness</em> in short. Even though here I assume for convenience a
representationalist framework for concepts according to which concepts
are mental representations realized in the brain &mdash; which is the
psychologist&rsquo;s preferred reading &mdash; nothing of any importance
hangs on this. The reader may substitute his or her own preferred
interpretation of how concepts are to be understood. For instance,
concepts may be merely certain sorts of mental or behavioral
capacities that are functionally or dispositionally characterized.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">
<p>
 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
The following is a sampling. For accounts pre-dating
Armstrong and Pitcher, see Baier (1964), Vesey (1965, 1967), Taylor
(1965, 1966), Holborow (1966), and Coburn (1966). For more modern
discussion, see Holly (1986), Hyman (2003), Wyller (2005), and Bain
(2007). There is also an extended debate between Paul Noordhof and
Michael Tye about whether the sense in which we locate pains
<em>in</em> body parts require special senses of &ldquo;in&rdquo; that
might not be spatial and whether this is in conflict with
representationalism about pain. See Noordhof (2001, 2002, 2006) and
Tye (2002, 2006a, 2006b). Olivier (2006) is a critical commentary on
the debate between Noordhof and Tye.</p>
</div>


<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Pitcher expresses his surprise in the opening paragraph of his
influential paper thus: </p>

<blockquote>
I shall defend the general thesis that to feel, or to have, a pain, is
to engage in a form of sense perception, that when a person has a
pain, he is perceiving something. This perceptual view of pain will
strike many as bizarre. But sense-datum theorists, at least, ought not
to find anything at all odd in it: indeed, I am puzzled why
philosophers of that school do not subscribe to the perceptual view of
pain <em>as a matter of course</em>. Since I am not a sense-datum
theorist, however, but a direct realist, I espouse what must at first
appear to be an irremediably perverse position &mdash; namely, a
direct realist version of the perceptual view of pain. (Pitcher 1970,
p. 368)
</blockquote>

<p>
See the pursuing text for why Pitcher calls his direct realist
position an &ldquo;irremediably perverse position.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Compare the following analogies:</p>

<blockquote>

<dl>
<dt>(i) Judy is dancing a waltz</dt>
<dt>(ii) The smile on John&rsquo;s face was mischievous</dt>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
It would be a mistake to analyze these sentences respectively as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<dl>
<dt>(i-a) There is an object that is a waltz such that Judy is
standing in the dancing relation to it.</dt>
<dt>(ii-a) There is a unique object which is a smile and mischievous
such that John has stood in the having-on-the-face relation to
it.</dt>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
Rather it is obvious that they should be rendered something like:</p>

<blockquote>

<dl>
<dt>(i-b) Judy is dancing waltz-ly.</dt>
<dt>(ii-b) John was smiling mischievously.</dt>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>
The ontology of (i-a) and (ii-a) seems costlier than that of (i-b) and
(ii-b) in that the former require two mysterious particulars <em>in
addition to</em> and <em>distinct from</em> Judy and John, whereas the
latter require, at least <em>prima facie</em>, only two particulars of
familiar sort, Judy and John, and their being engaged in an activity
of a certain kind or in a certain manner. The point of adverbialism in
philosophy of mind and perception is to use this maneuver with the
hope that whatever the true formal semantics of adverbs will turn out
to be it will not commit us to strange sorts of particulars: on the
whole we feel confident about what is going on ontologically when we
express a state-of-affairs by uttering a sentence in which one
adverbially qualifies a verb.</p>

<p>
So similarly when one is having a bluish after-image, one is not
standing in the seeing relation to a certain mysterious particular
that is blue in the way sense-datum theories demand. Rather, on
adverbialism, one is in a state of experiencing in a certain manner,
i.e., blue-ly; this is usually unpacked as being in a sensing state of
a certain sort, of the sort one is typically in when one is actually
seeing something blue. In other words, &lsquo;blue&rsquo; in reporting
a blue after-image does not qualify a physical or mental particular
that is actually blue, rather it qualifies an activity of the person
qua standard perceiver.</p>

<p>
The proper formal semantics of adverbs is still a controversial topic
in linguistics. But adverbialism is advanced primarily as an
ontological thesis in the philosophy of perception, although the
issues interact with each other. Also, strictly speaking, it might not
be true that adverbialism about perceptual experiences may make do
with only one individual, the perceiver. One prominent version of
adverbialism is the event modification theory, which quantifies over
primitive events and takes adverbs to modify these events &mdash; see
Davidson (1980). On this view, there are two individuals: the
perceiver and the event of her perceiving an object. But many
defenders of this view might take this commitment to be innocuous when
compared to a commitment of phenomenal objects like sense-data.</p>

<p>
For early defenses of adverbialism, see Ducasse (1952) and Sellars
(1975). Aune (1967) can be interpreted as a variant of adverbialism
explicitly applied to pain. Chisholm (1957) defends a view (the
&ldquo;theory of appearing&rdquo;) which has close affinities with
adverbialism. Kraut (1982), Lycan (1987a), and Tye (1984a) are more
recent and technically more sophisticated defenses of adverbialism in
general. Tye (1984b) and Douglas (1998) defend adverbialism about pain
specifically. The latter is an adverbialist reply to Langsam (1995)
who attempts to give an explanation of why we think and talk about
pains as mental objects. For powerful criticisms of adverbialism, see
Jackson (1975; 1977), Robinson (1994), and Foster (2000). </p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>
 For instance, when Pitcher first introduces the notion of
unpleasantness as the reason for why our concept of pain works the way
it does (see below), he writes in a parenthetical note: </p>

<blockquote>
(When I refer to the act, or state, of feeling pain as an
<em>experience</em>, I do not, of course, mean that it is an
exclusively mental happening or anything of the sort: I mean
&lsquo;experience&rsquo; in the sense that riding a bicycle or lying
on a rug before a fire is an experience &mdash; that is, merely as
something that we do or undergo.) (Pitcher 1970, pp. 379&ndash;80,
italics in the original.)
</blockquote>

<p>
Perhaps perceptual experiences are not exclusively mental happenings.
However, one cannot help but think that they are conscious
experiential episodes in a much more robust sense than riding a bike
is.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 Fred Dretske, Michael Tye, and David Bain are probably the best known
representationalists about pain and other such bodily sensations.
Lycan (1987a, pp. 60&ndash;61) contains a brief statement of a
representationalist account of pain; however, he does not claim that
the <em>affective</em> aspects of pain can also be handled
representationally. He seems to have in mind a mixed
representationalist-cum-psychofunctionalist theory about pain and
other bodily sensations. See below.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 A naturalist functional role psychosemantics (internalism) may not be
out of the question. See Carruthers (2000, Chp. 9) for a
representationalist account of pain that comes close to this &mdash;
what he calls a consumer&rsquo;s psychosemantics. Rey (1997, Chp. 11)
contains an account of sensory experience according to which
phenomenal properties are identified with narrow functional roles of
sensory states which roles are then identified with the narrow
representational content of these sensations. See also White (1986)
for a similar narrow functionalist account.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>
 Early direct realists like Pitcher and Armstrong, among others,
recognized this difficulty and explicitly addressed it. We don&rsquo;t
find a clear acknowledgement in strong representationalists about this
difficulty (but see Tye 2006a, 2006b). Hill (2006) contains an
extended discussion of this problem, but his solution involves the
rejection of the idea that the concept of pain applies to experience:
he argues that it applies to tissue damage, appearances
notwithstanding &mdash; however, see his 2017.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 Indeed, if they were genuine perception of bodily conditions, they
would be very odd forms of perception: nobody seems to have the
slightest idea about what they are perceptions of, which is manifested
in the fact that we don&rsquo;t have concepts that apply to what these
experiences may be representing. The concepts we have are none other
than the concepts TICKLE, TINGLE, which, just like PAIN, don&rsquo;t
seem to track physical conditions of the body parts that they are
applied to &mdash; they seem to track their experiences.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 See Price (1999, 2000, 2002, 2017) for an illuminating discussion of
such cases and underlying mechanisms. Price draws a distinction
between immediate unpleasantness of a pain experience and what he
calls pain&rsquo;s secondary affect, which consists of a conscious cognitive
appraisal of the consequences of the pain and its cause, which
involves various emotional reactions (e.g., worry, panic, anxiety,
arousal, depression, etc.) that typically last longer than the onset
of pain. He thinks that pain asymbolia involves cases where both the
immediate unpleasantness and the secondary affect are absent, whereas
in other cases, although immediate unpleasantness is present, the
secondary affect is absent.</p>

<p>
There is strong evidence that the disassociation between the sensory
vs. affective components of pain also goes in the other direction: in
addition to cases where the intensity of sensory component can be
reduced without affecting the unpleasantness of the experience
(Gracely et al. 1979), there is at least one well documented and
studied case where the patient experiences something very unpleasant
upon receiving nociceptive stimuli without being capable of
identifying his experience as pain (Ploner et al. 1999). It is worth
quoting from this study to illustrate the <em>prima facie</em>
counter-intuitive results, which provided strong support for the
bi-dimensional nature of pain experience:</p>

<blockquote>
[At higher intensities of cutaneous laser stimulation] the patient
spontaneously described a &lsquo;clearly unpleasant&rsquo;
intensity-dependent feeling emerging from an ill-localized area
&lsquo;somewhere between fingertips and shoulder&rsquo; that he wanted
to avoid. The fully cooperative and eloquent patient was completely
unable to further describe quality, localization, and intensity of the
perceived stimulus. Suggestions from a given list containing
&lsquo;warm&rsquo;, &lsquo;hot&rsquo;, &lsquo;cold&rsquo;,
&lsquo;touch&rsquo;, &lsquo;burning&rsquo;,
&lsquo;pinprick-like&rsquo;, &lsquo;slight pain&rsquo;,
&lsquo;moderate pain&rsquo;, and &lsquo;intense pain&rsquo; were
denied. (Ploner et al. 1999, p. 213).
</blockquote>

<p>
In personal communication, Donald Price has indicated an important
feature of the findings: the unpleasantness reported by the patient
has arisen only when the laser stimulus intensity has reached 350 mJ;
that is 150 mJ more than the normal pain threshold established for the
normal right hand. As emphasized by Price, this seems to indicate that
the disassociation of affect from sensation is not just a matter of a
parallel system being shot down, rather it leaves room for a serial
interpretation of the interaction between affect and sensation. Price
(2002) contains useful discussion of such cases.</p>

 <em>Perhaps</em>, because unlike what happens in other exteroceptive
sensory modalities, there is a huge variability between nociceptive
stimuli and pain experiences. This can be taken as evidence that even
the sensory-discriminative aspect of pain may not be representational,
or may not be <em>entirely</em> representational. A strong
representationalist needs to argue for her case in the face of
apparent scientific counterevidence &mdash; see Hill (2006, 2012) who
is sensitive to this issue. For a strong argument against
representationalism along these lines, see Pautz (2010).</p>

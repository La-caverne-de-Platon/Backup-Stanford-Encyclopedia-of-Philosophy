<h2>The Contingency of Humean Supervenience</h2>

<p>

As soon as one recognizes that there <em>could</em> be
non-spatiotemporal, perfectly natural relations&mdash;so that, if there
are none in the <em>actual</em> world, then that is a contingent
fact&mdash;one must recognize that HS (as stated in &sect;5) is false,
and can only be resuscitated in a weaker form. Perhaps this one: Among
worlds in which are instantiated no perfectly natural relations not
<em>actually</em> instantiated, no two worlds differ with respect to
what is true without differing with respect to the geometrical
arrangement of spacetime points, or with respect to which perfectly
natural properties are instantiated at those points. (Observe that this
form incorporates the thesis that the only <em>actual</em> perfectly
natural relations are spatiotemporal ones.) That makes HS a contingent
thesis, as no doubt it should be. But Lewis sees a second, quite
different reason for taking HS to be contingent. It is, I think, a poor
reason; but it deserves some scrutiny nonetheless. Here is what Lewis
says:</p>

<blockquote>

Humean Supervenience is meant to be contingent: it says that among
<em>worlds like ours</em>, no two differ without difference in the
arrangement of qualities. But when is a world like ours? I used to say:
when it&rsquo;s a world of the &ldquo;inner sphere&rdquo;, free of
fundamental properties or relations that are alien to our world. Sally
Haslanger (1994) has shown that this answer probably
won&rsquo;t do. One lesson of the Armstrong (1980) spinning sphere
(also known as the Kripke spinning disk) is that one way to get a
difference between worlds with the exact same arrangement of local
qualities is to have things that are bilocated in spacetime. Take two
worlds containing spheres of homogeneous matter, unlike the particulate
matter of our world; in one world the sphere spins and in the other it
doesn&rsquo;t; but the arrangement of local qualities is just the same.
These are worlds in which things persist through time not by consisting
of distinct temporal parts, but rather by bilocation in spacetime:
persisting things are wholly present in their entirety at different
times. The difference between the spinning and the stationary spheres
is a difference in the pattern of bilocation. No worries for Humean
Supervenience, so I thought: I believe that ours is a
temporal-parts-world, therefore neither of the worlds in the story is a
world like ours. But why assume that things that indulge in bilocation
must differ in their fundamental nature from things that don&rsquo;t?
Why think that if ours is a temporal-parts-world, then otherworldly
bilocated things must have properties alien to our world? No good
reason, I fear. Haslanger&rsquo;s point seems well taken. I still want
to insist that if ours is a temporal-parts-world, then
bilocation-worlds don&rsquo;t count as &ldquo;worlds like ours&rdquo;,
but I think I must abandon my former reason why not. (1994, pp.
474&ndash;475)</blockquote>

<p>

Lewis&rsquo;s reasoning here involves a bizarre failure of nerve. On
inspection, it is quite clear that he has perfectly good metaphysical
and methodological grounds for resisting the argument that worries him,
thereby preserving the clean statement of HS as a contingent thesis. To
see why this is so&mdash;and to achieve, thereby, a little more insight
into the resources provided by Lewis&rsquo;s conception of fundamental
ontology&mdash;let us begin by distinguishing two different views one
might have about spacetime and its contents (see</p>

<blockquote>
 <a href="spacetime-points.html">Supplement on spacetime points</a>
 </blockquote>

<p>

for more
discussion).<a name="return11"></a></p>

<p>

On a monist view, the only fundamental entities there are are
spacetime points&mdash;simple particulars that are <em>called</em>
&ldquo;space-time points&rdquo; simply because they instantiate
spatiotemporal relations. The world is the way it is, then, in virtue
of the spatiotemporal relations instantiated by the simple particulars
that constitute it, together with the monadic, perfectly natural
properties these particulars also instantiate. (And, perhaps, together
with other, non-spatiotemporal relations that they instantiate.) On a
rival, &ldquo;dualist&rdquo; conception, there are <em>two</em> sorts
of fundamental entities: simple particulars that instantiate
spatiotemporal relations (and are therefore to be called
&ldquo;spacetime points&rdquo;); and simple particulars that do not
instantiate spatiotemporal relations, but <em>do</em> bear a different,
perfectly natural relation of &ldquo;occupancy&rdquo; to spacetime
points (call these &ldquo;occupants&rdquo;). The world is the way
it is in virtue of the spatiotemporal relations instantiated by the
spacetime points, together with their pattern of occupancy by the
occupants, together with the pattern of instantiation of perfectly
natural monadic properties by these occupants. (A variant would
allow the spacetime points themselves to <em>also</em> instantiate
perfectly natural properties; we&rsquo;ll set this aside.)</p>

<p>

Suppose you take the second, dualist view. Then the difference
between a world in which everything persists through time by consisting
of distinct temporal parts, and a world in which at least some things
persist through time by being &ldquo;wholly present&rdquo; at different
moments of time, essentially boils down to this: In the first kind of
world, each occupant bears the occupancy relation to just <em>one</em>
spacetime point. In the second kind of world, this is not the case:
some occupants &ldquo;occupy&rdquo; distinct spacetime points, located
at different times. Now here is the crucial point: <em>You can have no
good reason to deny that worlds of the second type are at least
metaphysically possible.</em> For what could stand in the way of this?
Are we to suppose that there is something about the metaphysical nature
of the &ldquo;occupancy&rdquo; relation that guarantees that, if one
particular \(X\) bears it to another particular \(Y\), then that is the
<em>only</em> particular \(X\) bears it to? What could that be?
What&rsquo;s more, the metaphysical possibility granted, the epistemic is
not far behind: for what could count as empirical evidence that our
world is <em>not</em> of the second kind?</p>

<p>

Now, you could take a <em>mixed</em> view, according to which monism
and dualism are both <em>contingent</em> claims. In some worlds, there
are just spacetime points (i.e., bearers of spatiotemporal relations),
which also, in those worlds, instantiate perfectly natural monadic
properties. In other worlds, there are spacetime points and occupiers
thereof. But the conclusions of the last paragraph still stand: you
should hold that there are possible worlds in which at least some
things persist through time by being wholly present at different times,
and you should admit that you have no special reason for doubting the
ours is such a world.</p>

<p>

As an aside, there is clear textual evidence that Lewis takes the
mixed view:</p>

<blockquote>
 I don&rsquo;t really mean to say that no two possible worlds whatsoever
 differ in any way without differing in their arrangements of qualities.
 For I concede that Humean supervenience is at best a contingent truth.
 Two worlds might indeed differ only in unHumean ways, if one or both of
 them is a world where Humean supervenience fails. Perhaps there might
 be extra, irreducible external relations, besides spatiotemporal ones;
 there might be emergent natural properties of more-than-point-sized
 things; <em>there might be things that endure identically through time
 or space, and trace out loci that cut across all lines of qualitative
 continuity</em>. It is not, alas, unintelligible that there might be
 suchlike rubbish. <em>Some worlds have it.</em> And when they do, it
 can make differences between worlds even if they match perfectly in
 their arrangements of qualities. (1986a, p. x; italics added)

 </blockquote>
<p>

Here is what I take to be the upshot of our discussion so far:
\(If\) you believe in a fundamental, perfectly natural relation of
occupancy, then you <em>already</em> have reason enough to accept the
conclusion of Haslanger&rsquo;s argument; thought experiments
concerning spinning spheres add nothing. What is of real interest,
then, is whether her argument presents any sort of challenge to a
philosopher who&mdash;unlike, alas, Lewis&mdash;resolutely insists on
monism <em>as a necessary truth</em>. (In case it&rsquo;s not clear,
this is exactly the view I think Lewis <em>should</em> have
espoused.)</p>

<p>

I do not think it does. To see this, let&rsquo;s unpack the
troublesome argument.</p>

<p>

The first step is to establish&mdash;presumably, via an appeal to
modal intuitions&mdash;that there are possible worlds containing
homogeneous matter. Some authors (e.g., Callendar 2001) dispute this
step, but I won&rsquo;t. The next step is to argue that two such worlds
could differ <em>only</em> in that a sphere is spinning in one of them
but motionless in the other. The final step is to argue that this
difference must consist in different patterns of bilocation. I think
the game has been given up at the second step, and will focus my
attention there.</p>

<p>

We have a world containing homogeneous matter. Presumably, this matter
can be in motion, including rotational motion. We should now
ask&mdash;<em>before</em> considering the two worlds that seem to
cause the trouble&mdash;whether there is any way for HS to accommodate
motion of homogeneous matter. And of course there is.
But&mdash;crucially&mdash;the HS-friendly story of <em>what it is</em>
for homogeneous matter to be in motion will necessarily make reference
to the fundamental laws of nature for the given world, either directly
or via suitably chosen counterfactuals. For example, what it is for a
perfectly symmetrical sphere to be rotating might consist, in part, in
the truth of such counterfactuals as &ldquo;were a dot painted on the
sphere at time \(t\), the location of the dot at
time \(t'\) would be different in such-and-such a
way&rdquo;. The details don&rsquo;t matter for present purposes; all that is
important is that, provided an acceptable, HS-friendly account of laws
of nature is available, and provided there is a suitable account of how laws fix
truth-values for counterfactuals, there will be no special difficulty
in distinguishing,
<em>within</em> a world, between rotating and non-rotating spheres. The
key move is to view facts about motion of matter <em>not</em> as
part of the base-level facts about the world which it is the job of
laws of nature to
 govern<sup>[<a href="notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup>,
but rather as being in part <em>facts about
the nomological structure of the world itself</em>.</p>

<p>

That may seem an odd perspective to take on motion. So be it;
it&rsquo;s a perspective the defender of HS is stuck with
<em>anyway</em>. For consider a nice, Newtonian world of
point-particles, with nary a speck of homogeneous matter to be found.
What is it, according to Lewis, for a particle in such a world to be
<em>moving</em> (relative to a specified frame, say)? More exactly,
what makes it the case that <em>there is a moving particle</em>, as
opposed to its being the case that there is a spatiotemporally
contiguous succession of points that just happen all to be occupied? It
is, very roughly, for the pattern of occupation of spacetime points in
the future to counterfactually depend on the pattern of occupation in
the past in a certain way. And these patterns of counterfactual
dependence will themselves be fixed by the laws.</p>

<p>

And now, finally, it must be remembered that a HS-friendly account
of laws of nature will insist that the laws of nature in the two worlds
in question&mdash;the one with the spinning sphere and the one with the
motionless sphere&mdash;must be exactly the same. And so, since facts
about motion must be grounded in these laws, there is no difference in
the motion of the spheres, after all. There cannot be.</p>

<p>

Intuition will rebel, of course. And one can easily imagine words such
as the following, aimed at helping the rebellion along: &ldquo;Look,
you agree that there can be a single world&mdash;call it
\(w\)&mdash;containing both a spinning sphere and a stationary sphere. So
now just <em>remove</em> the spinning sphere. Along with it, remove
anything else (other than the stationary sphere) that might serve as a
landmark. That gives you world \(w_1\). Go back
to \(w\), and remove the <em>stationary</em> sphere, along with
any landmarks; that gives you \(w_2\). Since we&rsquo;ve removed the
landmarks, we cannot say that the spheres in \(w_1\) and
\(w_2\) are in different locations (so that we have a difference
in the local arrangement of qualities, after all). So, according to
HS, they must be exactly the same. But they&rsquo;re not: in one the sphere
is rotating; in the other it isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>

The proper response is to ask whether it has been granted that facts
about motion <em>just are</em> a certain kind of nomological fact. If
not, then the dispute really lies elsewhere&mdash;for example, our
interlocutor must hold that the defender of HS has <em>already</em>
made a mistake, in his description of a Newtonian particle world. But
if so, then the argument involves a tacit assumption that one can
<em>hold fixed the laws of nature</em>, while moving from \(w\) to
\(w_1\) and \(w_2\). That may be true,
on a conception of laws of nature that holds that they are
something <em>more</em> than mere patterns in the non-modal
phenomena. But that is not a conception the defender of HS can
endorse. And so again, the real dispute lies elsewhere. The idea that
the critic of HS gets some <em>special</em> traction from the spinning
sphere argument is simply confused. Had Lewis seen this, he could have
said that the argument is no stronger than the various direct attacks
to be found in the literature on his HS-friendly account of laws of
nature. We will leave consideration of those attacks for the companion
article; for now, the important lesson is that the only <em>good</em>
reason we have seen so far to reject HS in its strong form consists in
the possibility that nature might admit more perfectly natural
relations than the purely spatiotemporal.</p>

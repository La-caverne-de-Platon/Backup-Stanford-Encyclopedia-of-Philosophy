 </ul>

<h3><a name="Int">1. Introduction</a></h3>

<p>
Unlike Descartes, Hobbes wrote no single work devoted to the emotions.
But a number of texts contain extensive discussions: chapters 7, 9 and
12 of the <em>Elements of Law</em> (ms. 1640); <em>de Cive</em>
(1642); chapters 6 and 13 (among others) of <em>Leviathan</em> (1651);
chapter 25.12&ndash;13 of <em>de Corpore</em> (1655); and chapter 11 of
<em>de Homine</em> (1658). How Hobbes identifies and classifies the
passions changes over the years. But other views remain remarkably
consistent: particularly the identification of passions as a kind of
motion internal to the body and related to the will, the description
of happiness, or &ldquo;felicity,&rdquo; as continual success in
satisfying desires in the future (rather than the satisfaction
itself), the important place given to &ldquo;glory,&rdquo; and the
(rather curious) opposition between passion and reason.</p>

<h3><a name="HobMat">2. Hobbesian materialism</a></h3>

<p>
One touchstone of Hobbes&rsquo;s account is his materialist psychology.
Criticizing the &ldquo;metaphorical&rdquo; sense in which passions are
motions, he instead identifies them with material locomotion. Life
itself requires motion, Hobbes maintains, and there are many kinds of
motions within a living body: passions stand between the involuntary
&ldquo;vital&rdquo; motion characteristic of all living things, and
animal, or voluntary motion, by which animals move their bodies
through the world, driven by appetites and aversions. Hobbes links
motions caused by the impact of external objects on our sense organs
and the reverberations of &ldquo;decaying sense&rdquo; to the
imagination; the imagination in turn provides the &ldquo;small,&rdquo;
almost indiscernible, beginnings of animal motion, which Hobbes calls
endeavour, or &ldquo;conatus.&rdquo; Alterations in these small,
interior motions produce what we call &ldquo;deliberation,&rdquo; the
last motion of which is the will that produces voluntary motion.
Passions are identified as those interior beginnings of motion, by
which the imagination eventually motivates us to action. They thus
coincide with the will, and Hobbes emphasizes that the passions have a
motivating power through their attractive or aversive directions. He
sometimes (e.g., in the <em>Elements of Law</em>) locates different
faculties in different parts of the body: sense and imagination are
attributed to the brain, while the continuation of those motions to
the heart produces passions. Motion, however, circulates continuously
throughout the body. But it is only at the end of chapter 25 of <em>De
Corpore</em> that he provides a thoroughly materialist explanation of
how changes in vital motion result in appetitive or aversive action,
referring to the circulation of the blood (as explained by Harvey) and
linking it with a Stoic-sounding account of the contracting and
expanding of the animal spirits. He does not offer a description of
the physiology of any particular passion, as Descartes did. But he
always treats passions as motions within the body, and seems to think
that is sufficient to support his materialist claims.</p>

<h3><a name="ClaPas">3. The classification of the passions</a></h3>

<p>
As in other areas of his thought, Hobbes puts great stock in
definitions and taxonomy for the passions. Here, however, the texts
differ somewhat (Pacchi 1987). For instance, the <em>Elements of
Law</em> starts with the passion of &ldquo;glory,&rdquo; followed by a
long list of passions divided (more or less) into contraries, in a way
that seems indebted to Aristotle&rsquo;s <em>Rhetoric</em>. To these,
Hobbes adds such distinctively modern passions as
&ldquo;admiration&rdquo; and its opposite, &ldquo;contempt,&rdquo;
while allowing many passions to be compounds, e.g., of joy and grief.
Hobbes also distinguishes between passions directed at past and
present objects, and those directed at future ones; only the last are
the passions of the mind. In general, Hobbes seems more interested in
defining each passion, and placing it relative to its
&ldquo;opposite&rdquo; than in generating a well-ordered taxonomy from
the top down. But Chapter 9 of the <em>Elements</em> concludes with
Hobbes&rsquo;s famous list of passions, and related motions organized as
moments in a footrace:</p>

<blockquote>
To endeavour is appetite
<br />
To be remiss is sensuality.
<br />
To consider them behind is glory.
<br />
To consider them before is humility &hellip;
<br />
Continually to be out-gone is misery.
<br />
Continually to out-go the next before is felicity.
<br />
And to forsake the course is to die. (<em>Elements of Law</em> 9.21)
</blockquote>

<p>
On the other hand, chapter 6 of <em>Leviathan</em> shows many
similarities to Descartes, particularly in its identification of six
&ldquo;simple&rdquo; passions. These are not primary; appetite and
aversion are the primary drives, to which Hobbes adds
&ldquo;contempt&rdquo; as a neutral middle. The simples can be
compounded in innumerable ways to produce new passions; Hobbes lists
some thirty or so passions, which are just the simple passions
modified by diverse considerations. The list is not exhaustive, but it
does show how widely Hobbes tosses his nets: &ldquo;passions&rdquo;
include everything from ephemeral states (e.g., &ldquo;sudden
glory&rdquo; causing laughter), to moods (e.g., confidence and
diffidence), to character traits and dispositions (e.g., good nature,
covetousness and impudence).</p>

<p>
Hobbes also distinguishes in a number of places between sensual
pleasures (a kind of passion) and the passions of the mind. In the
<em>Elements of Law</em>, the difference that makes a difference is
found in the temporality of the object: sensual pleasures are directed
at present objects, whereas passions of the mind are concerned with
the future. <em>Leviathan</em> puts the difference in terms of whether
objects are considered as effect, means, or promise (although as long
as life lasts, these considerations are related in an endless cycle).
In both cases, however, Hobbes seems most interested in the passions
insofar as they concern objects that have not yet been attained. This
is typical of his generally future-directed approach to the
explanation of human life, an approach evident both in his definition
of felicity and in his account of how the fundamental law of nature
directs us in a forward-looking search to preserve our own lives.
Still, insofar as passions move us towards what promises pleasure and
away from painful prospects, Hobbes appears a psychological hedonist
(see Frykholm and Rutherford 2013).</p>

<h3><a name="PowFelPasGlo">4. Power, Felicity and the Passion for Glory</a></h3>

<p>
What makes for the prospect of success in satisfying our passions is
power, and thus, the pursuit of happiness is a matter of striving for
power. Power must be understood broadly: Hobbes maintains that the
greatest part of an individual&rsquo;s power is socially constructed,
either through the pooling of forces, or simply from the recognition
of one&rsquo;s (comparatively) great power by others. For this reason,
the passion for &ldquo;glory&rdquo; &ndash; which seems to involve
both a feeling of one&rsquo;s own power and the desire for its
recognition, along with the eclipse of others&rsquo; power &ndash; seems
a natural outgrowth and direct reflection of the striving for power by
beings like us. So it is not surprising that the most prominent member
of the list of passions provided in the <em>Elements of Law</em> is
glory. The passion is less prominent in the <em>Leviathan</em>,
although it figures as one of the basic causes of the war that marks
the &ldquo;natural condition of mankind.&rdquo; The search for glory
seems bound to produce conflict, since recognition is competitively
bought (especially in the state of nature), although the
<em>Leviathan</em> finds ways to satisfy the urge to glory without
unmanageable conflict (see Slomp, 1998). For this reason, the passion
for glory can give rise to self-destructive behavior in which conquest
is pursued further than security requires. Fortunately, the
disposition to this passion is not universal, since some people are
&ldquo;moderate.&rdquo; But it does seem inherent to the human
constitution, and Hobbes gives a psychological-reflective basis to the
propensity to this passion: glory involves a contemplation of
one&rsquo;s own power, which is inherently pleasurable &ndash; and
indeed closely related to the prospect of happiness (see
<em>Leviathan</em> 13.4, and Schmitter 2017).</p>

<h3><a name="PasStaNat">5. The Passions in and out of the State of Nature</a></h3>

<p>
The psychological gratification and self-fortifying nature of glory
also figures in Hobbes&rsquo;s famous account of the passions in the
state of nature. On the one hand, the passions endemic to the
&ldquo;natural condition&rdquo; of mankind (i.e., to life without a
sovereign authority) can be understood in terms of our native
&ldquo;endeavour&rdquo; to preserve our life, to satisfy our desires,
and to secure the prospect of continuing success in the future. In a
situation of rough &ldquo;equality of ability&rdquo; and scarcity of
goods, we will naturally feel an &ldquo;equality of hope&rdquo; for
attaining our ends. Competition is a natural response to that
situation, an appropriate strategy for attaining our ends. So too are
the passions of diffidence and glory (subject to the caveats already
discussed). The rub is that the collective behavior motivated by such
passions is at odds with what the laws of nature tells us &ndash; that
is, with rational consideration of how best to achieve whatever we
endeavor to achieve, and above all to preserve our own lives. Here we
have the first of several oppositions Hobbes sets up between the
motivations of the passions and the direction of reason, although the
conflict may be one inherent in practical reason itself. Hobbes does
allow that there are &ldquo;passions that incline men to peace,&rdquo;
e.g., &ldquo;the fear of death, desire of such things as are necessary
to commodious living, and a hope by their industry to obtain
them&rdquo; (<em>Leviathan</em> 13.14). And reason suggests that we
can transform our natural condition and satisfy our peaceable passions
by setting up a sovereign authority. Doing so may transform, or at
least modify, our &ldquo;natural&rdquo; passions. Certainly, we will
find new <em>objects</em> for our hopes, desires and fears. More
generally, it will become reasonable to cultivate a sociable
character, or &ldquo;complaisance&rdquo; (which is not explicitly
identified as a passion, but seems at least a disposition to specific
passions). Perhaps most importantly, the institutions of a
commonwealth under some sovereign authority will provide new forms of
power and new forms for the recognition of power that will channel the
passion for glory in directions consistent with communal living.</p>

<p>
What Hobbes seems to find the central problem in the state of nature
is not so much the preponderance of &ldquo;unsociable&rdquo; passions
as the lack of a &ldquo;common measure.&rdquo; Each person takes his
personal preferences, embodied in his particular passions, to be the
measure of good and evil. The institution of a sovereign authority
provides the missing common measure, as well as the ability to enforce
it. The passions become a problem for Hobbes, insofar as he identifies
them with the lack of such a measure, that is, with the
particularized, individual judgments of good and evil. The downfall of
Aristotle and other practitioners of &ldquo;darknesse from vain
philosophy&rdquo; lies in their failure to see that there is no
internal guide &ndash; not even passions moderated by reason &ndash;
that will provide an appropriate common measure in the absence of a
sovereign authority (<em>Leviathan</em> 46.32).</p>

<h3><a name="PasRea">6. Passions and Reason</a></h3>

<p>
The association of passions with the individual and idiosyncratic may
explain why Hobbes frequently opposes them to the &ldquo;common
measure&rdquo; provided by the pronouncements of reason. Such
opposition figures prominently in the <em>Elements of Law</em> and in
Parts III and IV of the <em>Leviathan</em>, which refuse to ascribe
passions to God. Nonetheless, the condemnation of reason in favor of
the passions strikes an odd note. For the passions are a crucial link
in the cycle of motion that constitutes living as such. Because they
are indispensable elements of any life, Hobbes criticizes philosophers
such as Aristotle who praise &ldquo;mediocrity&rdquo; (moderation) in
the passions. Instead, he associates the motion of
&ldquo;greater&rdquo; passions with greater ambition and greater
intelligence, although an excess of passion may produce giddiness or
madness. A &ldquo;defect&rdquo; of passion engenders
&ldquo;dulnesse,&rdquo; and a disorder of passions, melancholy or
enthusiasm (<em>Leviathan</em> 8.16&ndash;20). Moreover, passions seem to
provide the very material of reasoning. They are the &ldquo;beginnings
of speech,&rdquo; which are the necessary tools for reasoning about
universals. Perhaps most importantly, chapter 6 of <em>Leviathan</em>
declares that the deliberation that precedes will is itself simply an
alternation of passions. Hobbes makes no distinction here between
deliberation about means and deliberation about ends; a passion-motion
is necessary to initiate any animal motion, even if it is simply
action instrumental to some end. For these reasons, Hobbes declares
that &ldquo;the desires and other passions of man are in themselves no
sin&rdquo; (<em>Leviathan</em> 13.10).</p>

<p>
This contrast also poses a practical problem. For it seems impossible
that a reason divorced from the passions could ever control the
passions and the behavior they motivate. Chapter 14 of
<em>Leviathan</em> tells us that passions can only be bridled by other
passions &ndash; particularly, the passion of fear. One might think
that this is simply a matter of harnessing the passion of fear to
enforce that which reason has declared. But there is still a problem
of motivation, of what will move us to undertake harnessing fear to
reason; indeed, there is still the problem of how passion and reason
can come into contact to govern behavior at all. Passions are motions,
and Hobbes declares in <em>De Corpore</em> 9.7 that only motions can
affect other motions. Perhaps, though, we can avoid these puzzles if
we refuse to view the contrast between passion and reason as
reflecting a deep opposition in kind. Consider, for instance, how
Hobbes uses the contrast in <em>de Cive</em> 8.18: &ldquo;the naturall
state hath the same proportion to the Civill, I mean liberty to
subjection, which Passion hath to Reason, or a Beast to a Man.&rdquo;
The difference between passions and reason is analogous to that
between the natural state of liberty, particularly the liberty of
acting on idiosyncratic preferences, and the civil state where there
exists a common measure. Hobbes continues this theme in 9.1:</p>

<blockquote>
Lastly, out of [commonwealth], there is a Dominion of Passions, war,
fear, poverty, slovinlinesse, solitude, barbarisme, ignorance,
cruelty. In it, the Dominion of reason, peace, security, riches,
decency, society, elegancy, sciences, and benevolence.
</blockquote>

<p>
War, fear, and cruelty are certainly different from peace, security,
society, elegancy, sciences and benevolence, but each may be equally
motivated by passions (see <em>Leviathan</em> 13.13&ndash;14). It seems
plausible to understand Hobbes not so much to be opposing two separate
faculties, as distinguishing between the chaotic and unbridled
passions of the state of nature and what emerges when passions are
channeled by an overriding, organizing passion (fear of a coercive
power) to accord with a common measure. In any case, what seems most
important to Hobbes is the contrast between what drives conflict and
what allows cooperative endeavor, rather than any quasi-Stoic view
about how reason can overcome the passions.</p>

<h3><a name="InfLatAut">7. Influences on Later Authors</a></h3>

<p>
Hobbes&rsquo;s understanding of the passions presented an important
alternative both to Descartes&rsquo;s turn to understanding the passions
as perceptions rather than appetites and to his
&lsquo;functionalist&rsquo; approach to the passions. His refusal to
talk about the purposes of the passions made Hobbes attractive to
authors such as Spinoza who were bent on eliminating even the whisper
of teleological explanation. Spinoza&rsquo;s borrowings from the
Hobbesian account of the transition from the state of nature to
sovereign authority are well-known. But that debt is merely one
element in a shared approach to using the emotions to explain the
naturalistic mechanics of human behavior. True, Spinoza does not
emphasize the passion of glory as did Hobbes, taking a rather dim view
of what he calls &ldquo;ambition.&rdquo; But Spinoza does adopt many
of the psychological underpinnings Hobbes attributed to the passion in
his basic ontology, going so far as to extend the purview of the
&ldquo;conatus&rdquo; so that it becomes intrinsic to all finite
things, all of which express &ldquo;a perpetual and restless desire of
power after power&rdquo; (<em>Leviathan</em> 11.2). Spinoza likewise
contrasts passions and the &ldquo;common measure&rdquo; of reason, but
conceives it in terms of his contrast between what is active in us and
the merely passive emotions. We still must work within an internal
affective economy, in which &ldquo;only an affect can overcome an
affect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Hobbes also exerted a tremendous influence on later British writers on
the emotions, although there his influence was seen more as a
cautionary example than as a model. Walter Charleton included Hobbes
in his pantheon of illustrious sources, but Henry More expressed a
more common evaluation when he criticized Hobbes for considering
self-preservation the &ldquo;highest wisdom&rdquo; (1690, 62). In
particular, Hobbes came to be associated with the caustically
deflationary and egoist views of Bernard Mandeville and thus served as
a target for those philosophers who took morality to be rooted in
other-directed emotions or reasons. More generally, Hobbes became a
locus in a cluster of debates about the nature and corrigibility of
the emotions. (For further discussion, see the section on
 <a href="index-2.html#ChaVoc">Changing Vocabulary</a>
 in the main entry.) Whether Hobbes was interpreted fairly by these
successors depends on the proper understanding of what exactly he
meant by the &ldquo;passions&rdquo; and how they might figure among
the various conditions for social life. But it is noteworthy that
unlike such contemporaries as Edward Reynolds (1640), Hobbes does
<i>not</i> give self-love a prominent place in his enumeration of the
passions either in the <em>Elements of Law</em> or the
<em>Leviathan</em> (see Schmitter 2013a).</p>

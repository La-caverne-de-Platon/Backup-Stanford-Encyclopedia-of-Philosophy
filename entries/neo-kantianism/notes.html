<h2>Notes to <a href="index-2.html">Neo-Kantianism</a></h2>

<div id="note-1">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-1">1.</a>  There were, of course, other
members of the two schools. For reasons of space, this article covers
only Cohen, Natorp, Cassirer, Windelband, Rickert, and Lask.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-2">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-2">2.</a>  Please note that this article
concerns what might be called &ldquo;classical&rdquo; Neo-Kantianism:
the self-identified philosophical schools of late nineteenth and early
twentieth century Germany centered around Marburg and southwestern
Germany. Many philosophers are &ldquo;neo-Kantian&rdquo; in the
broader sense that they draw significant inspiration from aspects of
Kant&rsquo;s philosophy: for instance, earlier nineteenth century
philosophers such as Herbart or Schopenhauer were neo-Kantian in this
broad sense, as were other philosophers contemporary with the
classical Neo-Kantians&mdash;for instance, Hans Vaihinger or Wilhelm
Dilthey in Germany, Alois Riehl in Austria, &Eacute;mile Boutroux or
L&eacute;on Brunschvicg in France, and Robert Adamson or T.H. Green in
Britain. There are principled reasons, 
articulated in
 <a href="index-2.html#CommFeatNeoKant">section 1</a>
 of this article, for distinguishing the classical Neo-Kantians of the
Marburg and SW schools from &ldquo;neo-Kantians&rdquo; in this broader
sense. An article on neo-Kantianism in this broad sense would almost
constitute a complete history of philosophy from Kant up into the
twentieth century.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-3">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-3">3.</a>  Indeed, as Friedman (2000) argues,
Neo-Kantianism is the common root out of which both the so-called
&ldquo;analytic&rdquo; and &ldquo;continental&rdquo; traditions
grew.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-4">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-4">4.</a>  Though the Southwest and Marburg
Neo-Kantians did not initially present themselves as part of a common
movement, this tendency softened among &ldquo;third generation&rdquo;
Neo-Kantians, i.e., the Neo-Kantians contemporary with Cassirer and
Lask. For instance, the Neo-Kantians Bruno Bauch, Jonas Cohn, and
Richard H&ouml;nigswald all freely borrowed from both schools and did
not emphasize the differences between the schools so strongly.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-5">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-5">5.</a>  Citing the writings of the
Neo-Kantians presents some serious challenges, since few of the key
works have been translated in full into English, and many of these
works went through many editions, which often differ significantly
from one another. To address these difficulties, the following
conventions are adopted. Whenever possible, passages are cited by section number or
chapter (which are usually common between editions) instead of by page
number. When citing page numbers, citations are from English
translations whenever an English translation is listed in
Bibliography. Otherwise, the page citation is to the original language
edition cited in the Bibliography (unless an original language passage
is being cited that is not translated in the listed translation: such
cases are noted as they arise). Translations are from the cited
translations, unless otherwise noted. Whenever possible, 
texts with English translations are referenced over texts that currently
lack English translations, in order to aid the Anglophone reader. In
particular, this entry aims to refer as much as possible to
English-language editions that are widely available, such as the texts
collected in the <em>Neo-Kantian Reader</em> [abbreviation: NKR] (Luft
2015).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-6">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>  As Neo-Kantians were quick to point
out, this is just Kant&rsquo;s old point: there is a difference
between a question of fact (<em>quid facti</em>) and a question of
justification (<em>quid juris)</em>, between an empirical deduction
that shows how we humans come to acquire some representation and
transcendental deduction that shows its justification (Kant 1781/7:
A84-5/B116-7). (Citations to Kant 1781/87 are according to the
pagination in the first (&ldquo;A&rdquo;) and second (&ldquo;B&rdquo;)
edition. Page references to Kant&rsquo;s other works are to the
pagination in the Akademie [Ak] edition: Kant 1902&ndash;.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-7">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-7">7.</a>  In this respect, the Neo-Kantians
followed the lead of Kant himself.  In the first <em>Critique</em>,
Kant himself characterized mathematics not in terms of its object
(number and extensive magnitude), but in terms of its method (the
construction of concepts). In the third
<em>Critique</em>, Kant claims that biology is unique because of its
method: the use of teleological judgments. And according to the
<em>Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science,</em> physics is
distinctive because it delivers properly scientific knowledge by
allowing for the right kind of application of mathematics.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-8">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-8">8.</a>  In this way, again, they were
following Kant, whose argument in the first <em>Critique</em> for the
objective validity of the categories utilized a more general account
of the objective validity of all knowledge.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-9">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-9">9.</a>  After his retirement from Marburg
in 1912, Cohen wrote a series of books in the philosophy of religion,
articulating a vision of Judaism as a &ldquo;religion of
reason&rdquo;, an &ldquo;ethical monotheism&rdquo;. Cohen&rsquo;s
book <em>The Religion of Reason Out of the Sources of Monotheism</em>
(1919) is perhaps the most significant book in Jewish thought written
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and is surely (in terms of
intellectual and real world impact) the most significant book produced
by the Marburg Neo-Kantians. But its relations to the core doctrines
of the Marburg school are indirect, and so it is not discussed in
this article.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-10">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-10">10.</a>  The academic fate of the Marburg
School, unfortunately, was significantly impacted by the rising tide
of German anti-Semitism.  Cohen was an observant Jew, and his
promotion in Marburg in 1876 was made possible by a brief window of
tolerance in German politics. The Marburg School was often subjected
to thinly-veiled, and often even overt, anti-Semitic attacks. As
institutional anti-Semitism hardened, Cohen had more difficulty
placing his students, to the point that Cassirer had to struggle to
find an institution that would accept his two volume <em>Problem of
Knowledge</em> as a Habilitation. He eventually habilitated in Berlin,
but was prevented from holding a professorship until after the war,
when official discrimination was lessened in the Weimar
Republic. (Because Cassirer was unable to hold a professorship, Hans
Reichenbach, who took courses with him and always considered him his
teacher, was forced to officially submit his dissertation under a
different supervisor outside of Berlin.) Cassirer finally held a
position in Hamburg in 1919, and indeed was the rector of the
university in 1929&ndash;30, the first Jewish rector of a German
university. But all of this collapsed in 1933 when Hitler was
appointed Chancellor, and Cassirer was forced to flee the country.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>  In keeping with the Marburg
tendency, the progressive development of culture is understood very
abstractly, and not as historical or temporal. Natorp&rsquo;s model is
the progression from a number to its successor in the natural number
sequence: the progression is not temporal or arbitrary, but is
grounded in a law, i.e., the axioms of arithmetic (1910: Ch.1,
&sect;5).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>  There are a few reasons for this
distinctive method. First, the transcendental method requires an
initial stage of &ldquo;data collection&rdquo;, in which the goal is
to lay out the detailed, concrete features of some area of culture,
along with its historical development. To give systematic
philosophical theories without first canvassing the history of the
topic would amount to trying to carry out the second step of the
transcendental method without the first.  Second, the transcendental
method prescribes that philosophical reflection not be done in
isolation from the facts of culture. For this reason, the Marburg
philosophers were keen to show that the core doctrines of past
philosophers were in fact developed in continual conversation with
other areas of culture, in particular with natural science. This way
of doing history of philosophy&mdash;where the history of philosophy
and the history of science are presented together as one
narrative&mdash;culminated in Cassirer&rsquo;s
<em>Problem of Knowledge.</em> Third, the transcendental method
(unlike the method of speculative idealism) is not foundationalist,
but requires that philosophical reflection start up only after an area
of culture has reached a stage of maturity where it can be
self-reflective. Philosophy, then, always begins &ldquo;in the
middle&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>  In his later book on quantum
mechanics, <em>Determinism and Indeterminism in the Philosophy of
Physics</em>, Cassirer argues (1936: Ch.12) that the real
philosophical significance of QM is not its conflict with an alleged
classical conception of causality, but rather its requirement that we
rethink what it is to be an individual particle in a determinate state
(and thus rethink the concepts
<em>substance</em> and <em>accident</em>), given superposition and
Heisenberg uncertainty.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-14">14.</a>  Cohen (1898) recognized this
possibility in his discussion of Hertz, since he allows that all three
of the rival foundations for mechanics are equally consistent with the
empirical data. Cassirer (1921: 354) later cited Einstein&rsquo;s
special theory and Lorentz&rsquo;s theory as rival theories, the
choice of which could not be decided on the basis of experiments
alone.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>  Interestingly, Cassirer argues
(1921: Ch.2) that Einstein&rsquo;s principle of general covariance is
supported by such a regulative principle. By requiring that the laws
of nature be the same for any observer, whether the observer be at
rest, undergoing inertial motion, or even accelerated motion,
Einstein&rsquo;s theory accords with the general demand that
scientific laws be &ldquo;de-anthropologized&rdquo; and thus made
fully objective (see Ryckman 2005: 45).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>  Lask self-consciously aligned
himself with the Southwest school, and defended their core commitment,
that the subject matter of philosophy is validity. However, he was in
many ways an internal critic, who incorporated many of the ideas of
Husserl&rsquo;s <em>Logical Investigations</em> (Husserl 1900). See
below,
 <a href="index-2.html#TheoKnow_1">section 3.2</a>.</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-17">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-17">17.</a>  Rickert put this idea more
sharply by distinguishing two kinds of generality of values. A value
is &ldquo;factually general&rdquo; if it is held by all humans (or all
members of the relevant community); a value is normatively general if
its &ldquo;recognition is in fact required of all members of a certain
community&rdquo; (Rickert 1902: 376).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-18">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>  In Rickert&rsquo;s <em>The Object
of Knowledge</em> (Rickert 1915: 47, Chapter I, &sect;7: &ldquo;Das
erkenntnistheoretische Subjekt&rdquo;), and in Windelband&rsquo;s
later writings (1910: 319), the notion of a &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
consciousness is expressed using Kant&rsquo;s famous phrase
&ldquo;consciousness in general&rdquo; from the <em>Prolegomena</em>
(Kant 1783: &sect;20; Ak 4:300). There, Kant argued that there is a
difference between &ldquo;judgments of perception&rdquo;, which are
subjectively valid and express only a consciousness of my own state,
and &ldquo;judgments of experience&rdquo;, which are objectively valid
and express a connection &ldquo;in consciousness in
general&rdquo;. Rickert and Windelband self-consciously echo this
argument, interpreting Kant&rsquo;s distinction as a fact/value
distinction: consciousness in general is what ought to be judged, not
what in fact I do judge.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-19">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>  This claim that every universally
valid norm has an a priori basis is made the defining feature of
Neo-Kantianism in Anderson 2005. It may be more accurate to
restrict this to SW Neo-Kantianism, since the fact/value distinction
is not thematized by the Marburg Neo-Kantians.</p>

<p>
This defining claim can again be extracted from Kant&rsquo;s
discussion of &ldquo;consciousness in general&rdquo;, given the SW
Neo-Kantians&rsquo; reading of this as a normative consciousness. In
<em>Prolegomena</em> &sect;20, Kant argues that the ascent from
consciousness of my own state to consciousness in general requires
certain special a priori concepts, the categories. SW Neo-Kantianism
takes on this idea as well, again interpreted normatively.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>  Lask is echoing Kant&rsquo;s
famous analogy between what Copernicus accomplished in astronomy and
what he takes himself to have accomplished in metaphysics: Kant
1781/7: Bxvi&ndash;xvii.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>  Rickert replies to this criticism
from Lask in Rickert 1915: 282.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-22">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>  An excellent presentation and
interpretation of Lask&rsquo;s very difficult theory is Emundts
2008.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-23">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-23">23.</a>  Since truth becomes a kind of
correspondence, Lask holds that there needs to be some way of
cognizing the object, <em>prior</em> to the act of judging, which
furnishes that against which the content of the judgment can be
compared. This kind of cognition, which is passive and prior to any
act of judging, Lask calls &ldquo;<em>Hingabe</em>&rdquo;
[abandonment] (Lask 1912: 135, Ch.2, &sect;2). In so doing, Lask is
rejecting a fundamental Neo-Kantian commitment that all cognizing is
judging. (Compare Rickert 1915: 168: &ldquo;Erkennen ist immer
Urteilen&rdquo;.) In accepting the correspondence theory in <em>Die
Lehre vom Urteil,</em> Lask is also departing from his own view in
Lask 1911, where he rejected the correspondence theory.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-24">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-24">24.</a>  On this issue: see Beiser 2014a:
Ch.4. On the place of SW Neo-Kantianism in this debate, and for an
excellent treatment of the philosophy of history of SW Neo-Kantians,
see Beiser 2011:, Chs.  9&ndash;11.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-25">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-25">25.</a>  Of course, Windelband (as well as
Rickert) were quite clear that a historian conducting her research
will need to make use of general propositions from nomothetic
sciences, just as nomothetic scientists can make use of results of
idiographic sciences and can even make claims about singular things
(e.g., the Milky Way, the Triassic period). Nevertheless, there is
still a fundamental difference in the goals of the two kinds of
sciences.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-26">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>  Windelband&rsquo;s resistance to
this positivist reductionism is another example of the non-revisionism
intrinsic to the transcendental method: recognizing the autonomy of
history is simply recognizing the way the best contemporary historians
were in fact doing their research.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-27">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-27">27.</a>  Windelband&rsquo;s claim that
psychology is nomothetic is opposed to the Marburg view that
psychology is the science of the subjective, and so is not
nomothetic. On the Marburg view of psychology, see the Supplement,
 <a href="psychology.html">Philosophy of Psychology in the Marburg School</a>.</p>
 </div>

<div id="note-28">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-28">28.</a>  On the debate between Dilthey and
Windelband and Rickert, see Makkreel 2010 and Makkreel &amp; Luft
2010. Partially in response to Windelband&rsquo;s criticisms, Dilthey
1894 introduces his well-known distinction between explanation and
interpretation (or understanding), arguing that the
Geisteswissenschaften depend, not on &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo;
psychology, which &ldquo;explains&rdquo; mental phenomena in the
nomothetic way Windelband identified, but on &ldquo;descriptive&rdquo;
psychology, which &ldquo;interprets&rdquo; or
&ldquo;understands&rdquo; some mental phenomenon. This view is like
the SW view, in distinguishing history from the natural sciences in
terms of a distinctive method. For Rickert&rsquo;s criticism of this
more mature Diltheyan position, see Rickert 1902: 369.</p>

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-29">29.</a>  Here, Rickert is drawing on the
view that the content of an intuition is always potentially infinitely
complex, and it is the work of a concept to select out (in accordance
with certain a priori norms) certain features. See
 <a href="index-2.html#TheoKnow_1">section 3.2</a>.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-30">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-30">30.</a>  Rickert also clearly articulated
two other senses of &ldquo;generality&rdquo; that are at play in the
formation of the concepts of history. The concept of Caesar, though it
only applies to one individual, Caesar, is nevertheless composed of
general concepts (such as <em>being Roman</em>, <em>being a
soldier</em>, <em>being assassinated</em>). The concept of Caesar
ought also be integrated into a more &ldquo;general&rdquo; historical
nexus, say, through showing its relation to the concept of the Late
Roman Empire. In this sense, one historical individual, Caesar, is
part of a larger historical individual, the Late Roman Empire.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-31">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-31">31.</a>  Rickert makes his point with some
care. Of course, even natural scientists are sensitive to values,
inasmuch as they are concerned with truth; but only in history do we
form concepts constrained by those features of a subject that are
value-relevant. Furthermore, the historian is making theoretical
claims, not aesthetic or practical claims. Everyone can agree that
Goethe is a historical individual, and that certain facts about him
are historically relevant, whether or not one happens to like his
poetry, approve of his character, or even have any personal attachment
to German culture. The historian <em>qua</em> historian does not make
determinate value judgments about her subjects. (Still less should
historians argue that history acts teleologically to realize certain
values, such as freedom, reason, or the will of God.)</p>
</div>

<div id="note-32">

<p>

<a href="index-2.html#ref-32">32.</a>  Rickert believes that the notion
of a value-relevant historical individual explains why it seems
natural to distinguish history from natural science in terms
of <em>Geist</em> or mind. Any historical individual (whether it be a
particular human, like Caesar, or not) is part of a wider historical
nexus, which inevitably will include human subjects. Since the values
employed by the historian are universally valid, this means that any
historical individual will be part of a historical nexus that includes
humans who value that individual. But valuing can only be done by
minds. This explains the sense in which history is about what is
mental. Still, though, Rickert argues that the truly important aspect
of an historical individual is not that it is thought about by a mind,
but that it is valued.</p>

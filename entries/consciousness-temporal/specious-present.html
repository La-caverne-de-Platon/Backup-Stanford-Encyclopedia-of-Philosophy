<h3 id="DuraDist">1. Durations and Distinctions</h3>

<p>

In &sect;4&ndash;&sect;6 the focus was largely on the character and
composition of individual specious presents, as variously construed by
different forms of realism, and the manner in which these combine to
form streams of consciousness. There are issues involving the
relationship between specious presents and the wider world &ndash; in
particular, ordinary clock-time &ndash; which were not there
examined. When someone claims the specious present is
typically around (say) one second in extent, what does the claim amount
to? Seconds (along with minutes, hours and days) are a measure of
ordinary, objective, public time &ndash; time as it is measured by
clocks and stop-watches. Can this temporal metric be extended to
the domain of the subjective? Can <em>experienced</em> duration
be measured and clocked in the same way as durations of lighting bolts,
100 metre sprints and other happenings in the wider world? The
answer (probably) is &lsquo;to a reasonable approximation&rsquo;, but
there are some complications, and certain distinctions need to be drawn
and recognized.</p>

<p>

The relevant distinctions are most easily brought into play by
considering experiences that are directly triggered by environmental
causes, i.e., experiences of the perceptual variety. Let us
suppose that a certain event N is of such a duration that it can be
perceived as a whole (within a single specious present), and that
experience E is a perception of N. Following Clay, let us suppose
that N is shooting star, visible for around a second. The
perceiving of N is depicted in Figure 21 below, where matters are
viewed from the vantage point of the Extensional approach &ndash; we
will be considering the situation from a Retentional point of view in
due course.</p>

<p>

Up for consideration are the relationships between four temporal
magnitudes: [1] the duration of the event perceived (call this
<em>R</em>); [2] the duration of the proximal sensory stimulus produced
by this event (call this <em>T</em>) &ndash; this will usually be the
amount of time a subject&rsquo;s sensory organs are stimulated in
response to the perceived event; [3] the objective duration of the
experience (E) produced by this stimulus (call this <em>O</em>); [4]
the subjective or phenomenal duration of E (call this <em>S</em>).</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break">
<img alt="Figure21" src="Fig21.png" width="500" />
<p class="center"><span class="figlabel">Figure 21.</span></p>
</div>

<p>

Consider first the relationship between N, R and T. On the
reasonable assumption that the perceiver of this event is some distance
from the event itself, the light generated by the falling meteor will
take some short but finite time to traverse this distance, hence the
short delay between the initial phase of N and the onset of the
stimulus T &ndash; which in this case we can take to be the light from
N hitting the retinas of our subject&rsquo;s eyes. Although under
normal circumstances the durations of R and T will closely coincide,
there are circumstances in which they can diverge. E.g., if the
light or sound emitted by a perceived event is scrambled, compressed or
stretched <em>en route</em> to the perceiver, the duration of T (and
even the temporal ordering of its parts) will be affected, and the
resulting experience will probably misrepresent the temporal properties
of the perceived event to a significant degree.</p>

<p>

What of the relationship between T and O, the durations of the
sensory stimuli and the duration of the resulting experience? As
can be seen, although T begins at time t<sub>1</sub> and ceases at
t<sub>2</sub>, the resulting experience (E) starts at a slightly later
time t<sub>1</sub>* and ends at t<sub>2</sub>*, which is itself
slightly later than t<sub>2</sub>. These differences are a
consequence of two considerations: it takes some time for signals
produced in our sensory organs to reach our brains, it also takes our
brains some time to process these signals and produce the appropriate
experience in response to them. Results from psychophysics
suggest that it can take as little as 60 msec, or as long as 500 msec,
for a stimulus to reach (or produce) experience, depending on the
subject, type of stimulus, sensory modality, and the task the subject
is attempting to perform. (For further discussion see Section 2 of
the supplementary Document 
 <a href="empirical-findings.html">Some Relevant Empirical Findings (Psychology, Psychophysics, Neuroscience)</a>.)</p>

<p>

There is a further point to notice in this connection. The
objective duration of E is the amount of ordinary (clock) time that
experience E takes up. In this case, this duration is
t<sub>1</sub>*-t<sub>2</sub>*. Why is this duration is
greater than that of T? In the general run of cases the durations
of perceptual experiences and their proximal stimuli match almost
exactly. If they did not, our experience of music &ndash; to pick
just one example &ndash; would be greatly different than it is: when
performing, a violinist can safely assume that notes played for the
same (objective) duration will be <em>heard</em> as having the same
duration. However, in the case of very brief stimuli the
resulting experience tends to last a good deal longer than the stimulus
itself: e.g. a 1 msec flash of light can produce visual experiences
lasting from 100msec to 400msec &ndash; a phenomenon known as
&lsquo;visible persistence&rsquo;. Figure 21 serves as a useful
reminder of the fact that it is at least possible for these two
durations to diverge. (For further discussion of visible
persistence see Section 1 of the supplementary document
 <a href="empirical-findings.html">Some Relevant Empirical Findings (Psychology, Psychophysics, Neuroscience)</a>.)</p>

<p>

Last but not least there is S: the <em>phenomenal</em>
<em>duration</em> of E, as we might call it. This is the
<em>felt</em> duration of E, the temporal extent of E construed solely
(or purely) as a phenomenal item. While it is not wrong to say
that phenomenal duration is how long an experience <em>seems</em>, this
should not be taken to mean that phenomenal duration is determined by
how long a subject <em>judges</em> an experience to be.
Since our judgements about features of our experience are fallible, it
is possible (on the face of it, at least) for the real phenomenal
duration of an experience to differ from what we judge it to be.
No less importantly, there may be some subjects who are incapable of
making <em>any</em> judgements about any aspect of their experience
&ndash; many non-human animals may fall into this category. To
mark the distinction let us use <em>seconds*</em> (and
<em>minutes*</em> etc.) to refer exclusively to phenomenal
durations.</p>

<p>

Suppose there are (possible) worlds in which there are subjects
whose experience is akin to our own, but nothing resembling a physical
world &ndash; worlds of the sort described by idealists such as
Berkeley and Leibniz. In such worlds (if such there be) there are
<em>only</em> phenomenal durations: there are seconds* but no
seconds. In our world there are (probably) seconds* and seconds,
but since we do not have a standard unit of measure for phenomenal
duration, in our everyday thought and talk about it we naturally tend
to use the objective measures. We use external time-keepers, such
as clocks or watches, to gauge the apparent lengths of our experiences,
and consequently we employ units such as &lsquo;second&rsquo; and
&lsquo;minute&rsquo; to refer to both objective and subjective
durations. Although there is nothing to prevent our marking the
distinction formally, as has just been done here, for the most part
doing so would serve little purpose: the subjective character of the
experience of looking at a blue sky for three seconds (as measured
objectively) does not, for the most part, vary greatly; it seems
reasonable to suppose that if subjective and objective durations were
often markedly out of synch we would be unable to engage with the world
as effectively as we do. That said, there are familiar occasions
when phenomenal and objective time fail to march precisely in
step. When waiting for a watched pan to boil, an objective minute
can be filled by more than 60 seconds*, as the passage of subjective
time slows relative to the wider world. There may well be more
radical examples of the same phenomenon: some hallucinogenic drugs are
reported to leave subjects with the impression that they have had vast
temporal tracts of experience (centuries, epochs) in only a few
objective hours. And of course, the discrepancy can go the other
way: while enjoying ourselves it often seems that there are fewer than
the usual number of seconds* in a minute or hour; certain stimulants
are said to have the same
 effect.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-29" id="ref-29">29</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

These distinctions all apply within the Retentional framework, albeit
with a few modifications, as shown in Figure 22.</p>

<div class="figure avoid-break">
<img alt="Figure22" src="Fig22.png" width="500" />
<p class="center"><span class="figlabel">Figure 22.</span></p>
</div>

<p>

As previously, there are delays between the occurrence of the event
perceived, the stimulation of the relevant sensory organs, and the
eventual production of perceptual experience. The main difference
is where Extensional theorists hold that the stimulus T results in a
single temporally extended experience stretching from t<sub>1</sub>* to
t<sub>2</sub>* which possesses phenomenal duration S, the
Retentionalist posits instead a continuous period of
<em>experiencing</em> stretching from t<sub>1</sub>* to t<sub>2</sub>*,
and further holds that at each moment during this period the subject is
experiencing a temporal spread of content with phenomenal duration S
&ndash; only a subset of these specious presents are depicted in Figure
22.</p>

<h3 id="EstiDuraSpecPres">2. Estimating the Duration of the Specious Present</h3>

<p>

Although a good deal of empirical research has been carried out
relating to the experience and perception of time over short intervals,
this research has not generally been motivated by a desire to confirm
or disconfirm one or other of the competing conceptions of the
structure of temporal
 consciousness.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-30" id="ref-30">30</a>]</sup>
Even so, there are a number of results
relevant to the issues discussed thus far.</p>

<p>

One issue to have been investigated is the manner in which very
brief stimuli register in experience. It has been found that
stimuli of around 1 msec need to be separated from one another by in
interval of around 30 msec if they are to be perceived <em>as</em> a
succession &ndash; a result which holds across sensory
modalities. Stimuli which are separated by shorter intervals are
not perceived as distinct &ndash; though this &lsquo;coincidence
threshold&rsquo; varies a good deal for the different sense
modalities. For more on this see Section 3 of the supplementary
document
 <a href="empirical-findings.html">Some Relevant Empirical Findings (Psychology, Psychophysics, Neuroscience)</a>.
 A related topic has also been investigated: the minimal
durations of perceptual experiences. Experiences produced by very
brief stimuli are often longer, objectively speaking, than the stimuli
themselves, but how brief (objectively speaking) can an experience
be? Results from psychophysics vary a good deal, but answers
range from 25 to 240 msec, depending on the task being undertaken and
type of stimulus. See Section 4 of the supplementary document
 <a href="empirical-findings.html">Some Relevant Empirical Findings (Psychology, Psychophysics, Neuroscience)</a>
 for further discussion and references.</p>

<p>

Of particular interest is the specious present itself.
Realists may disagree about the manner in which change and persistence
are incorporated into consciousness &ndash; the stories told by
Cinematic theorists, Retentionalists and Extensionalists are very
different &ndash; but they agree that our awareness <em>appears</em> to
embrace a brief temporal interval. How long is this
interval? We have just seen that there are reasons for supposing
that there are <em>minimal</em> experienced durations, what is the
<em>maximum</em> duration which can be apprehended as a whole? In
short, how long is a typical specious present?</p>

<p>

Attempts to answer this question face complications on several
fronts. First, there is the need to distinguish between the
durations of perceptual stimuli and the duration of the resulting
experiences, and the fact that these can diverge, quite markedly in the
case of brief stimuli. Second, it would be wrong simply to assume
that the specious presents of different sense modalities are of exactly
the same extent, and likewise for different subjects. Third, even
if we set the possibility of intersubjective differences aside, there
is also the possibility that any given period of experience (as
measured by ordinary clock-time) can possess widely varying subjective
or phenomenal durations, e.g. a minute&rsquo;s worth of experience can
pass very quickly (if one is having a good time), pass very slowly (if
one is <em>not</em> having a good time), or seem to last an eternity
(if one has ingested certain drugs). Seconds* and seconds usually
march in step, but there are occasions when they do not.</p>

<p>

For the purposes of a rough-and-ready estimate, however, these
difficulties may not be insurmountable. While the potential for
discernible divergences between the duration of a stimulus and
objective duration of the experience to which it gives rise can
certainly be significant over the short-term &ndash; of, say, 200 msec
or below &ndash; it is less so over longer intervals. (Otherwise such
discrepancies would be more noticeable than they are in ordinary
life.) In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is not
unreasonable to suppose that if inter-modal differences do exist, they
are fairly small in comparison with the duration of the specious
present itself, and similarly for differences between subjects.  As
for the relationship between phenomenal and objective durations, there
no doubt are very real difficulties in establishing a precise metric
relating the two, and more work on this problem is very much needed,
but for only an approximate estimate such a metric may not be
needed. We all know what it is like to listen to a 3 second burst of
white noise, or to gaze at a white wall for 5 seconds or so, whilst
being in a normal state of consciousness &ndash; i.e., in an average
sort of mood, free from significantly mind-altering chemicals, and so
forth. We are thus able to establish a reasonably accurate correlation
between seconds* and seconds in at least some circumstances, and for
certain types of experience.  Once this correlation is established, we
can ask of an interval of (say) 3 seconds/seconds*: roughly how much
shorter (or longer) is the duration of the specious present? If most
subjects reply &lsquo;about half&rsquo;, we could reasonably conclude
that a typical specious present is of the order of 1.5
seconds <em>and</em> 1.5 seconds* &ndash; a rough estimate of this
sort would need refining, and would not be valid for all subjects and
circumstances, but it would also be a useful starting point. It is
because seconds and seconds* <em>do</em> so often coincide that
typical estimates of the specious present&rsquo;s duration can (charitably)
be taken as referring to both objective and phenomenal durations.</p>

<p>

Reluctant (perhaps) to generalize from their own experience,
philosophers writing on this topic have generally been reluctant to
offer any such estimates. Among the few exceptions, Dainton
(2000: 171) tentatively opts for a figure of half a second or less;
Lockwood suggests this is on the short side, and suggests a more
realistic figure would be &lsquo;a second or a second and a half&rsquo;
(2005: 381). Strawson goes the other way, and suggests a figure
of around 300msec (2009: 5.9). Does the psychological literature
offer anything more precise or better substantiated?</p>

<p>

Unfortunately, while estimates are not difficult to find, they tend
not to be measures of the specious present as we are currently
construing it. In 1984 Fraisse concluded his review of the
literature by suggesting that we need to recognize three &lsquo;orders
of duration&rsquo;:</p>

<blockquote>

These orders are the following (a) less than 100 msec, at which
perception is an instantaneity, (b) 100 msec &ndash; 5 sec, perception
of a duration in the perceived present, and (c), above 5 sec,
estimations of duration involving memory. &hellip; The perception of
duration, <em>stricto sensu</em>, is situate at a level above 100 msec
and within the limits of the psychological present as described by W
James (1890) &hellip; The duration of the presentifiable can hardly
extend beyond 5 sec. (1984: 30)</blockquote>

<p>

This is an improvement on James&rsquo; estimate of 12 seconds or so,
but even 5 seconds is implausible if we construe the specious present
in the way we are currently doing, as the period during which change
and persistence are immediately apprehended. More recently,
P&ouml;ppel writes:</p>

<blockquote>

The subjective present as a basic temporal phenomenon has interested
psychologists for a hundred years (e.g., James 1890). We are now in a
position to indicate how long such a subjective present actually
lasts. This numerical answer can be derived from a number of
different experiments which all converge to a value of approximately 2
to 3 seconds. (2004: 298)</blockquote>

<p>

However, none of the plentiful evidence cited P&ouml;ppel cites in
support of this claim directly concerns the immediate experience of
change. A few examples will illustrate the point: (i) If subjects
are asked to reproduce the duration of either an auditory or a visual
stimulus, they can do so very accurately for stimuli which are up to 2
to 3 seconds long, but much less accurately for longer stimuli. (ii)
Subjects who are exposed to uniform successive stimuli &ndash; such as
the clicks of a metronome &ndash; will impose a &lsquo;subjective
structure&rsquo; onto them: rather than hearing a monotonous
&lsquo;click &hellip; click &hellip;. click &hellip;&rsquo; one finds
oneself hearing &lsquo;CLICK &hellip; click, click CLICK
&hellip; click, click&rsquo; or variants thereof. This
spontaneous grouping has a temporal limit of about 2.5 seconds.
(iii) Ambiguous figures (such as duck-rabbit drawings, or vase/faces)
can be interpreted (or better: <em>seen</em>) in either of two ways;
such changes in perceptual content occur spontaneously, at roughly 3
second intervals. Now, these results &ndash; and others along the
same lines &ndash; are by no means uninteresting. It may well be
that the 2&ndash;3 second cycle is relevant to how our brains process
information &ndash; and relevant in ways which impact on the sort of
experience we enjoy &ndash; but as an estimate of the duration of the
specious present it is not very plausible at all. (If this is not evident, a simple experiment will assist.  Clap your hands three times, leaving about a second between each clap; when the third clap takes place, are you still directly aware of the first?) </p>

<p>

Rather more plausible is the figure of 0.75 seconds (or 750 msec)
which Benussi&rsquo;s tachistoscopic experiments led him to
propose. Benussi was a psychologist of the Graz school
(influenced by Brentano and Meinong) working in the early
20<sup>th</sup> century, and was well aware of the distinction between
the duration of a stimulus and the duration of the resulting
experience. Moreover, he construed the specious present in the
same way as Broad and Russell, as the maximum duration in which change
or succession can be experienced as a whole:</p>

<blockquote>

As Benussi proved in laboratory experiments, the time of presentness
is not a limit or a non-extensive instant &hellip; It is that
<em>stretch of change which is apprehended as a unit</em> and which is
the object of a single mental act of apprehension. The limits to
the content of consciousness are also the limits of the boundaries of
the field of consciousness. (Albertazzi 1996: 118)</blockquote>

<p>

For a (brief) description of the methods employed by Benussi see
Albertazzi (2001:
 115).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-31" id="ref-31">31</a>]</sup>
Mabbott cites the same figure:
&lsquo;philosophers have generally tended to believe that the
psychologists have shown experimentally that our direct apprehension of
time is restricted to a certain short duration and that they have
determined the normal length of this duration by measurement. It is
usually given as 0.75 seconds.&rsquo; (1951: 156). He
suggests this figure largely derives from experiments conducted by
followers of Wundt in the 1880&rsquo;s. Since these experiments
were intended to pin down the temporal intervals which subjects could
<em>estimate</em> most accurately, rather than apprehend as wholes,
their relevance to our current concerns is questionable. Mabbot
also points out that later attempts to replicate the findings failed to
do so.</p>

<h3 id="JameSpecPres">3. James on the Specious Present</h3>

<p>

While James&rsquo; made a significant contribution to our
understanding of the nature and character of our short-term experience
of time and change, his discussion in chapter 15 of the
<em>Principles</em> has engendered a good deal of puzzlement and
confusion. I will briefly focus on two issues here.</p>

<p>

The first concerns the duration of the specious present. If we take the specious present to be the (maximal) window through which we are directly aware of change and
persistence, then it is plausible to suppose that it is of the order of
a second or so. (If need be, repeat the experiment mentioned in the previous section: clap your hands twice in row, and ask yourself if you are still <em>hearing</em>
the first clap as the second clap occurs.) But James himself says
that the most important part of the specious present &ndash; its
&lsquo;nucleus&rsquo; &ndash; is around &lsquo;the dozen or so seconds
that have just elapsed&rsquo; (1890: 611), and that this nucleus is
surrounded by a vaguer fringe of &lsquo;probably not more than a minute
ago&rsquo;. Later on he repeats the claim: &lsquo;our maximum
distinct <em>intuition</em> of duration hardly covers more than a dozen
seconds (while our maximum vague intuition is probably not more than a
minute or so)&rsquo; (1890: 630)</p>

<p>

What are we to make of this? James takes the figure of a dozen
seconds from the experiments of Wundt and Dietze which, as James
characterizes them, sought to &lsquo;determine experimentally the
<em>maximal extent of our immediate distinct consciousness for
successive impressions</em>.&rsquo; (1890: 612) Both experiments,
however, actually measured the accuracy with which fast sequences of
brief sounds could be <em>accurately recalled</em> after exposure to
them. Wundt arrived at a figure of 3.6 to 6 seconds, whereas
Dietze settled on a maximum of 12 seconds &ndash; James opted for
latter. Given the nature of these experiments, James&rsquo;
characterization of them is certainly misleading &ndash; or just plain
wrong. Nonetheless, the fact that he was willing to contemplate a
specious present with a nucleus of up to a dozen seconds &ndash; and a
considerably more encompassing fringe &ndash; suggests that on at least
some occasions, he used the term in a very broad way, to refer to a
period of time to which we have a distinctive <em>cognitive</em>
access, e.g., via short-term memory and vivid
 anticipation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-32" id="ref-32">32</a>]</sup>
On other
occasions, when for example he describes the specious present as
&lsquo;the short duration of which we are immediately and incessantly
sensible&rsquo; he gives the impression at least of working with a
narrower
 interpretation.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-33" id="ref-33">33</a>]</sup>
While the narrower, purely sensory or
phenomenal interpretation became commonplace in the 20<sup>th</sup>
century &ndash; hence the adoption of it here &ndash; it may well be
anachronistic to foist it on James. It is of course tempting to
think that if one were to put it to James that within the 6&ndash;12 second
span of easily remembered past time there is an <em>inner</em> nucleus
within which change and persistence are directly apprehended in sensory
manner he would have agreed. But we cannot be sure.</p>

<p>

When James&rsquo; views as to the 12&ndash;60 second extent of the
specious present are combined with his &lsquo;saddleback&rsquo; picture
&ndash; of the specious present having past- and future-directed
components &ndash; it is easy to demonstrate that absurdities
follow. If this were the case, wouldn&rsquo;t a sprinter have a
dim awareness of the starters&rsquo; gun up to half a minute before it
actually occurs? Mightn&rsquo;t 100 metre sprints be completed
before the starting gun even fires? (See Plumer (1985) for more
along these lines.) But while <em>some</em> conceptions of the
specious present are undeniably problematic for these reasons,
<em>other</em> conceptions &ndash; conceptions which confine it to a
briefer interval, conceptions which do not entail detailed knowledge of
future events &ndash; are by no means as vulnerable to the charge of
obvious absurdity.</p>

<p>

The next question: where did James stand with regard to the
Extensional and Retentional approaches? There are certainly
occasions when he seems committed to the existence of duration-blocks
of the sort which form the bedrock of the Extensional view. There
are also formulations suggestive of the Overlap Model, or something not
far off it: &lsquo;Objects fade of out consciousness slowly. If
the present thought is of A B C D E F G, the next one will be of B C D
E F G H, and the one after that of C D E F G H I &ndash; the lingerings
of the past dropping successively away, and the incomings of the future
making up the loss.&rsquo; (1890: 606). Perhaps most importantly
in this connection, James is famed for his rejection of atomistic
conceptions of the stream of consciousness, a rejection which entails
the existence of real experiential connections between neighbouring
stream-phases, or so one might naturally suppose. Certainly in
his later writings he was adamant on this point, as in these passages
from &lsquo;A World of Pure
 Experience&rsquo;<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-34" id="ref-34">34</a>]</sup>:</p>

<blockquote>

For such a philosophy [radical empiricism], <em>the relations that
connect experiences must themselves be experienced relations, and any
kind of relation experienced must be counted as &lsquo;real&rsquo; as
anything else in the system. &hellip;.</em> The conjunctive
relation that has given most trouble to philosophy is <em>the
co-conscious transition</em>, so to call it, by which one experience
passes into another when both belong to the same self. My
experiences and your experiences are &lsquo;with&rsquo; each other in
various external ways, but mine pass into mine, and yours pass into
yours in a way in which yours and mine never pass into one
another. Within each of our personal histories, subject, object,
interest and purpose <em>are continuous or may be
continuous</em>. Personal histories are processes of change in
time, and <em>the change itself is one of the things immediately
experienced</em>. &lsquo;Change&rsquo; in this case means
continuous as opposed to discontinuous transition. But continuous
transition is one sort of conjunctive relation; and to be a radical
empiricist means to hold fast to this conjunctive relation of all
others, for this is the strategic point, the position through which, if
a hole be made, all the corruptions of dialectics and all the
metaphysical fictions pour into our philosophy.</blockquote>

<p>

Given this firm commitment to conjunctive relations and co-conscious
transitions, it might seem inevitable that James would subscribe to
some form of the Extensional approach. In fact, at least in the
<em>Principles</em>, he seemed to do the opposite, at least on some
occasions, and particularly in the section entitled &lsquo;The Feeling
of Past Time is a Present Feeling&rsquo;. He writes &lsquo;what
is past, to be known as past, must be known <em>with</em> what is
present, and <em>during</em> the &lsquo;present&rsquo; spot of
time&rsquo; (1890: 629). Expanding on this he cites first
Volkmann, according to whom &lsquo;A and B are to be represented <em>as
occurring in succession</em> they must be simultaneously represented;
if we are to think of them as one after the other, we must
<em>think</em> them both at once&rsquo;. As clear a statement of the
core principle behind the Retentional approach as one might wish
for. James himself follows up thus:</p>

<blockquote>

If we represent the actual time-stream of our thinking by an
horizontal line, the thought <em>of</em> the stream or of any segment
of its length, past, present, or to come, might be figured in a
perpendicular raised upon the horizontal at a certain point. The length
of this perpendicular stands for a certain object or content, which in
this case is the time thought of, and all of which is thought of
together at the actual moment of the stream upon which the
perpendicular is raised. (1890: 629)</blockquote>

<p>

This description obviously fits the various diagrams employed by
Broad and Husserl. In fact, James here is following in the footsteps of
James Ward, whom he goes on to quote, and who clearly was advocating a
straightforward version of Retentionalism: &lsquo;In reality, past,
present, and future are differences in time, but in presentation all
that corresponds to these differences is in consciousness
simultaneously.&rsquo; (<em>ibid.</em>). Evidence of James&rsquo;
apparent commitment to the Retentional approach are littered through
these
 pages.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-35" id="ref-35">35</a>]</sup></p>

<p>

As for what we should make of this, perhaps the only safe conclusion
to draw is that while James certainly believed in the continuity of
consciousness, and the immediate experience of change and persistence, during this period he was also alert to the appeal of the Retentional account of how these
modes of experience are possible. Whether he was entirely content
with this account, it is difficult to
 say.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#note-36" id="ref-36">36</a>]</sup>
In his later writings on
these matters, with some relief, he embraced a neo-Bergsonian position,
according to which the flux of experience cannot be fully captured conceptually:</p>

<blockquote>

&hellip; the simplest bits of immediate experience are their own
others, if that hegelian phrase be once for all allowed. The
concrete pulses of experience appear pent in by no such definite limits
as our conceptual substitutes for them are confined by. The run
into each other and seem to interpenetrate &hellip; You feel no one of
them as inwardly simple, and yet no two as wholly without confluence
where they touch. There is no datum so small as not to show this
mystery, if mystery it be. The tiniest feeling that we can
possibly have comes with an earlier and a later part and with a sense
of their continuous precession. (1909: 282)</blockquote>

<p>

As James now saw things, reality can still be a certain way even if we cannot make intellectual sense of how it is possible for it to be so.</p>

<p>

So far as temporal experience is concerned, it is perhaps too early to
say whether or not James&rsquo;s stance is overly pessimistic.  In any
event, in the chapter of <em> A Pluralistic Universe</em> devoted to
Bergson&rsquo;s philosophy (entitled &lsquo;Bergson&rsquo;s Critique
of Intellectualism&rsquo;) James again provides an illustration of the
Extensionalist overlap model of stream-structure:</p>

<blockquote>
Take its continuity as an example. Terms like A and C appear to be
connected by intermediaries, by B for example.&hellip; Imagine a heavy
log which takes two men to carry it. First A and B take it. Then C
takes hold and A drops off; then D takes hold and B drops off, so that
C and D now bear it; and so on. The log meanwhile never drops, and
keeps its sameness throughout the journey. Even so it is with all our
experiences. Their changes are not complete annihilations followed by
complete creations of something absolutely novel. There is partial
decay and partial growth, and all the while a nucleus of relative
constancy from which what decays drops off, and which takes into
itself whatever is grafted on &hellip; (1909: 257&ndash;8)</blockquote>

<p>
In his discussion of time perception in the <em>Principles</em> twenty
years earlier James gave a prominent place to the Retentional-style
models of Wundt and Ward.  Since in <em> A Pluralistic Universe </em>
there is no trace of these at all, it is by no means impossible that,
thanks in part to Bergson&rsquo;s influence, James had moved in an
Extensional direction. </p>

<p>

These points aside, James&rsquo; various descriptions of the
specious present remain as influential as ever. Here is
another:</p>

<blockquote>

Its <em>content</em> is in a constant flux, events dawning into its
forward end as fast as they fade out of its rearward one, and each of
them changing its time-coefficient from &lsquo;not yet,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;not quite yet,&rsquo; to &lsquo;just gone&rsquo; or
&lsquo;gone,&rsquo; as it passes by. Meanwhile, the specious present,
the intuited duration, stands permanent, like the rainbow on the
waterfall, with its own quality unchanged by the events that stream
through it. (1890: 630)</blockquote>

<p>

James clearly believed that there is an unvarying <em>structure</em>
or <em>mechanism</em> underlying our temporal awareness, as did Husserl
after him. If this is right, and if (as many believe)
consciousness is essentially temporal, then this structure (or
mechanism) is an essential component of consciousness itself, in all
its forms. Hence the importance of the enterprise of arriving at
a clear and accurate understanding of the composition and functioning
of the specious present.</p>

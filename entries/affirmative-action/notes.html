 Preferences for women don&rsquo;t figure into the current controversy
because women have no trouble competing for college admissions. 2016
figures show women constituting 54 percent of college students and 58
percent of graduate and professional school students. Data from 2017
show women making up 49 percent of first year law school students and
50.7 percent of medical school enrollees. See</p>

 So profound was the shock to the academy that Nicholas Capaldi,
writing in 1985, remained under the impression that
&ldquo;[a]ffirmative action as a public policy was first applied on a
massive and national scale to institutions of higher learning&rdquo;
(Capaldi 1985, 1).</p>

 Ironically enough, the first discussions of &ldquo;inverse&rdquo;
discrimination began in one of the prime sites of analytical
philosophy, <em>Analysis</em>. For the full record of exchanges, see

 Similar sentiments were expressed by Virginia Black:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
If it is irrational and unjust and cruel to fire someone because he is
a black or she is a woman&mdash;cases whose absurdity seems
obvious&mdash;then it is equally irrational and unjust and cruel to
hire someone because be is a black or she is a woman. To appreciate
the parallel, one has only to remember that to hire X <em>because</em>
of color is, ipso facto, <em>not</em> to hire Y because of color. When
inscribed in law, this is racism. (Black 1974, 106).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
See also Capaldi 1998, 535, 536 (affirmative action is
&ldquo;incoherent&rdquo; in practice and &ldquo;illogical&rdquo;).</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-6">6.</a>
 This idea that using racial preferences involves a kind of practical
contradiction was given voice and support at the highest levels of
government in the 1980s. William Bradford Reynolds, during his tenure
as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the Reagan
Administration, contended:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[T]o those who argue that we must use race to get beyond racism
&hellip;[h]istory teaches us all too well that such an approach does
not work. It is wrong when the government bestows advantages on whites
at the expense of innocent blacks; it assumes no greater claim of
morality if the tables are turned&hellip;. Whatever group membership
one inherits, it carries with it no entitlement to preferential
treatment over those not similarly endowed with the same immutable
characteristics. Any compromise of this principle is discrimination,
plain and simple, and such behavior is no more tolerable when employed
remedially, in the name of &ldquo;affirmative action&rdquo; or
&ldquo;racial balance,&rdquo; to bestow a gratuitous advantage on
members of a particular group, than when it is divorced from such
beneficence and for the most invidious of reasons works to one&rsquo;s
disadvantage. (Reynolds 1984, 1004).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While Reynolds found the proposition, &ldquo;Use race to achieve a
colorblind society,&rdquo; an assault on common sense, he belonged to
an administration&mdash;like a long line of previous
administrations&mdash;whose defense policy was grounded on the
proposition, &ldquo;Prepare for war in order to have peace.&rdquo;</p>

 Title 42 United States Code Sec. 2000d. Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972 promised the same protection against gender
discrimination. See 20 USC 1681.</p>

 &ldquo;(a) It shall be unlawful for an employer (1) to refuse to hire
or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against
any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or
privileges of employment, because of such individual&rsquo;s race,
color, religion, sex, or national origin; or (2) to limit, segregate,
or classify his employees or applicants in any way which would tend to
deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise
adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such
individual&rsquo;s race, color, religion, sex, or national
origin.&rdquo; Title 42 USC Sec 2000e-2. Unlike Title VI, Title VII
went on to spell out some exceptions. Under special circumstances, the
Title permitted the use of gender, religion, and national origin as
legitimate bases for employer selection. But it made no such exception
for race. While being a woman or being a Roman Catholic could
sometimes count as a legitimate occupational qualification, being
black could not.</p>

 <em>Griggs v. Duke Power Company</em>, 401 U.S. 424 (1971), at 430,
431. At issue in the case was the use of an aptitude test and a
high-school graduation requirement to screen job applicants. Duke
Power Company did not succeed in showing that the results of the
aptitude test or the possession of a high school diploma bore any
demonstrable relation to performance at such of its jobs as janitor,
maintenance worker, and the like.</p>

 Consider, for example, this 1969 court decision involving a union
with a record of excluding African-Americans and Mexican-Americans.
The court imposed an injunction that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
prohibit[ed] discrimination in excluding persons from union membership
or referring persons for work; prohibit[ed] use of member&rsquo;s
endorsements, family relationship or elections as criteria for
membership; &hellip;ordered the development of objective membership
criteria and prohibited new members &hellip;until developed; and
ordered continuation of chronological referrals for work, with
alternating white and Negro referrals until objective membership
criteria are developed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the lower
court. In its view,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[t]he District Court did no more than prevent future discrimination
when it prohibited a continuing exclusion of Negroes through the
application of an apparently neutral membership provision
&hellip;which served no significant trade-related purpose. [Further]
the District Court did no more [in barring new membership until
objective criteria were developed] than ensure that the injunction
against further racial discrimination would be fairly administered.
Absent objective criteria &hellip;covert subversion of the purpose of
the injunction could occur. The same administrative reasons support
alternating white and Negro referrals&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
<em>Asbestos Workers v. Vogler</em>, 407 F. 2d 1047 (1960), at 1051,
1055. Each part of the lower court&rsquo;s order, including the part
that required racially balanced referrals, harkened back to a single
ground: the part was necessary to prevent future discrimination.</p>

 In 1974, the Court had accepted for decision a similar case involving
a race-preference policy at the University of Washington Law School.
However, perhaps experiencing second thoughts, the Court then
dismissed the case as moot (the plaintiff, admitted to the Law School
by a lower court, was about to graduate). See <em>De Funis v.
Odegaard</em>, 416 U.S. 312 (1974).</p>

 Unlike Title VII, which is grounded in the Interstate Commerce Clause
of the Constitution, Title VI is grounded in the federal
government&rsquo;s spending powers. Brennan relied on Congressional
debate over the Civil Rights Act to argue for the substantive identity
of Title VI with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution (which
forbids states to discriminate) and the Fifth Amendment (which
incorporates the Fourteenth Amendment&rsquo;s strictures and applies
them to the federal government). The debate can be summed up in this
rhetorical question: &ldquo;Why should the government through its
spending subsidize acts of private discrimination that it would be
forbidden by the Constitution to do itself?&rdquo; See <em>Bakke</em>,
at 329&ndash;336 (Brennan, dissenting).</p>

 To see the limitations of political theory, consider John
Rawls&rsquo; theory of justice as fairness. For our purposes, what is
striking about the theory is the division of labor it embraces. Its
very broadest principles of liberty and equality are themselves unable
to single out proper micro-allocations of social benefits and burdens.
This is not a defect; this is their nature. What they can do is guide
the structuring of basic social roles and institutions which then, in
their operations, create the social and legal machinery for assigning
benefits and burdens. Rawls&rsquo; principles oblige a constitution to
protect equality of citizenship but leaves most other matters to
legislative judgment. Thus, a law that in form and fact makes some
people second-class citizens would be unjust, clearly; but this
limitation doesn&rsquo;t bar government from asking people to bear
unequal burdens for the common good, not even unequal burdens premised
on race or ethnicity. Nor does Rawls&rsquo; principle of fair equality
of opportunity block such burdens, either, for, while ordinarily
discouraging selection based on race or ethnicity, it can itself be
limited in the name of achieving greater equality of opportunity (the
point made by Goldman in the text, above). To reformers in a society
that has greviously failed to secure equal citizenship and fair
equality of opportunity throughout its history, Rawls&rsquo;
principles supply few guideposts.</p>

<p>
Robert S. Taylor (2009) disagrees. He argues that Rawls&rsquo;
principle of fair equality of opportunity implies quite definite
policy restrictions on affirmative action. In particular, the
principle rules out using racial or gender preferences to overcome the
legacy of disadvantage engendered by our society&rsquo;s long history
of racial oppression and gender subordination. Taylor&rsquo;s
intricate and lengthy argument guides us through the
ideal/non&ndash;ideal distinction in Rawls and the role that pure
procedural justice plays in ideal theory. Policies adopted in a
far&ndash;from&ndash;ideal world may have to depart from the
&ldquo;letter&rdquo; of the fair equality of opportunity principle,
according to Taylor, but should never violate its
&ldquo;spirit.&rdquo; If society were permitted to adopt any means
necessary to overcome a legacy of injustice, that would makes
Rawls&rsquo; theory too instrumentalist; it would put the
non&ndash;ideal part of the theory in &ldquo;fatal tension&rdquo; with
its &ldquo;deontological ideal&ndash;theory counterpart&rdquo;
(Taylor, 490). Society, aiming for justice, must seek to
&ldquo;counterbalance and ultimately eliminate the social
disadvantages of gender [and] race&rdquo; through programs that
equalize &ldquo;inputs&rdquo; to human capital formation. Special
training, mentoring, and funding directed toward disadvantaged groups
may violate the &ldquo;letter&rdquo; of <em>formal</em> equal
opportunity but are justified to bring about greater justice. By
patiently, systematically applying such &ldquo;inputs&rdquo; society
will eventually neutralize unjust disadvantages, Taylor argues. But
what if structures of informal and systemic discrimination are so
robust that this application can&rsquo;t possibly eventuate in a just
society? Taylor concedes that resort to racial and gender preferences
might then be warranted on Rawlsian grounds. He believes, however,
that such structural blockages are rare (Taylor 502).</p>

<p>
The crux of Taylor&rsquo;s complaint against racial and ethnic
preferences is this: the &ldquo;spirit&rdquo; of fair equality of
opportunity lies in its pure proceduralism. A &ldquo;fair
distribution&rdquo; of jobs and college admissions &ldquo;is simply
whatever emerges from a fair procedure, defined as one that
neutralizes social contingencies&rdquo; such as class-position,
wealth, and the like (Taylor, 493). If these contingenies aren&rsquo;t
neutralized and some groups continue to suffer unjust disadvantages,
the way is nevertheless not open to use a tool like racial preferences
to mimic the distribution of benefits that would have obtained
otherwise. &ldquo;[W]e simply cannot know what the counterfactual
results of a &lsquo;clean&rsquo; competition would look like&rdquo;
(Taylor, 494). D. C. Matthew (2015) and Kristen Mishelski (2016) take
issue with Taylor&rsquo;s argument. They accuse him of
misunderstanding how pure procedural justice works (Meshelski, 437,
439) and what it implies for non-deal circumstances (Matthew, 334).
They dispute our ignorance of outcomes under ideal conditions
(Meshelski, 440-441) or that it is disabling (Matthew, 333-334).
Meshelski admits the policy implications of her rebuttal are
&ldquo;narrow&rdquo; (441) and, indeed, a careful reading of these
three essays ends up shedding very little light on affirmative action
as a legitimate undertaking (though it may sharpen our understanding
of the complexities in Rawls&rsquo; theory of justice). </p>

 <a href= "index-2.html#ref-26">26.</a>  Consider the waffling in the
 University of Texas brief in <em>Fisher
</em> 2016. The University claims to operate with a &ldquo;broad
vision of diversity&rdquo;. It goes on: &ldquo;The educational
benefits of diversity include, but are not limited to, bringing unique
and direct perspectives to the issues and topics discussed and debated
in classrooms, promoting cross&ndash;racial understanding, breaking
down racial and ethnic stereotypes, and creating an environment in
which students do not feel like spokespersons for their race&rdquo;
(University of Texas 2015, 5). All of the benefits listed here,
including the &ldquo;unique and direct perspectives,&rdquo; refer to
upshots of racial diversity, though the sentence begins with
&ldquo;diversity&rdquo; unmodified and within an initial framing of a
&ldquo;broad vision.&rdquo; </p>

 According to Anderson, integration helps undermine stereotypes. Here
is what she says about integrated education.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The stereotypes in question are forms of practical incompetence,
embodied in clumsy and disrespectful habits that typically inform our
behavior in an unconscious way. Breaking them down is a matter of
acquiring practical knowledge, a skilL of engaging with people of
different races in a manner that is sensitive to and respectful of
their individual differences and social circumstances. This is why
this knowledge cannot be obtained [in schools] solely from curricular
materials or from a racially homogenous faculty. <em>It requires
actually interacting with people of different races</em>. Nor can it
be obtained from token numbers of blacks, Latinos, and Native
Americans who would populate selective college campuses in the absence
of affirmative action [&hellip;] <em>A critical mass of students of a
given racial group needs to be present to help people learn to see
internal heterogeneity in that group</em>. This explains why the
educational interest in racial diversity needs to pay &ldquo;attention
to the numbers&rdquo; (Anderson 2002, 1224 [emphases added; footnotes
omitted]).</p>

<p>
[E]lites in a democratic society, in which racial ascriptions and
identities place people in different walks of life, need to be
educated in racially integrated settings (Anderson 2004, 26).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On its face it looks as though Anderson is siding with the
<em>amici</em> briefs discussed earlier in making integrated education
an imperative. Thus, it would be interesting to know her take on the
Spelman graduate in my example and the adequacy of her education. This
is not an idle question. In her book, <em>The Imperative of
Integration</em>, she seems committed to the &ldquo;imperative&rdquo;
without qualification. Tommie Shelby in a long review of her book
takes issue with her on this point, focusing especially on spacial
integration (Shelby 2014). Anderson refers only in passing to
Historically Black Colleges and Universities but implies their time
has passed: &ldquo;Black students today who attend
majority&ndash;white colleges have higher incomes than HBC
graduates&rdquo; (Anderson 2014, 169). She doesn&rsquo;t address
directly whether the Spelman graduate has had a
&ldquo;deficient&rdquo; education and, if so, whether the deficiency
lies in her not &ldquo;actually interacting with people of different
races.&rdquo; </p>

 In 2007, after taking testimony from several individuals including
Sander, the U. S. Civil Rights Commission published a briefing
document proposing that &ldquo;[l]aw schools voluntarily
disclose&hellip;[information] on student academic performance,
attrition, graduation, bar passage, student loan default, and future
income disaggregated by academic credentials.&rdquo; During the same
period, Sander asked the State Bar Association of California to allow
conditional access to its data base about bar passage from
1972&ndash;2007. This data base indicates for 246,000 applicants to
the bar whether they passed the bar exam, their scores, the law
schools they attended, their LSAT scores and GPAs. The State Bar
refused and Sander sued. The State Bar alleged its disclosiure of the
records would violate the confidentiality of bar exam takers. Sander
proposed to &ldquo;access&hellip;[the] admissions
records&hellip;<em>subject to conditions designed to ensure the
privacy of bar applicants</em>&rdquo; (emphasis added). Litigation
ensued for eight years. In November 2016, a trial court found for the
State Bar on the grounds that none of Sander&rsquo;s proposals could
successfully anonymize the records. See <em>Sander v. State Bar of
California</em>, Supreme Court of California, Case No. S194951,
December 19, 2013, and <em>Sander v. State Bar of California</em>,
Superior Court of California, San Francisco, Department 305, Case No.

 Bernard Boxill has insisted that merely receiving benefits produced
by injustice is enough to make one personally liable to compensate the
victim of injustice (Boxill 1972). And who is the victim of injustice?
&ldquo;We <em>know</em> that all blacks, lower class, middle class,
and upper class, have been wronged by racial injustice&rdquo; (Boxill
1984, 164). In Boxill 1978, 251, he argues that the correlation
between &ldquo;preferences received&rdquo; and &ldquo;compensation
deserved,&rdquo; though not perfect, is very high. A recent piece by
D. W. Haslett (2002) also conceives of affirmative action as a way to
neutralize &ldquo;tainted&rdquo; advantages enjoyed by whites,
although he concedes that the neutralization is &ldquo;extremely
rough&rdquo; (83). James Sterba carries on the tradition, striving to
refute the claim that affirmative action distributes its benefits and
burdens in an up-side down way, rewarding well&ndash;off blacks and
placing the costs on unoffending whites. Well&ndash;off blacks are no
less victims of discrimination, he insists, and nearly every white has
unjustly benefited from racial discrimination (Sterba 2009,
89&ndash;90. Fiscus 1992 echoes Justice Brennan&rsquo;s argument and
generalizes it. See also Wise 2003. </p>

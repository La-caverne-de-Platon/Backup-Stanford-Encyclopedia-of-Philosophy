<h2>History</h2>

<p>
This supplement elaborates on the history of the articulation,
promotion and adoption of critical thinking as an educational
goal.</p>

<p>
John Dewey (1910: 74, 82) introduced the term &lsquo;critical
thinking&rsquo; as the name of an educational goal, which he
identified with a scientific attitude of mind. More commonly, he
called the goal &lsquo;reflective thought&rsquo;, &lsquo;reflective
thinking&rsquo;, &lsquo;reflection&rsquo;, or just
&lsquo;thought&rsquo; or &lsquo;thinking&rsquo;. He describes his book
as written for two purposes. The first was to help people to
appreciate the kinship of children&rsquo;s native curiosity, fertile
imagination and love of experimental inquiry to the scientific
attitude. The second was to help people to consider how recognizing
this kinship in educational practice &ldquo;would make for individual
happiness and the reduction of social waste&rdquo; (iii). He notes
that the ideas in the book obtained concreteness in the Laboratory
School in Chicago.</p>

<p>
Dewey&rsquo;s ideas were put into practice by some of the schools that
participated in the Eight-Year Study in the 1930s sponsored by the
Progressive Education Association in the United States. For this
study, 300 colleges agreed to consider for admission graduates of 30
selected secondary schools or school systems from around the country
who experimented with the content and methods of teaching, even if the
graduates had not completed the then-prescribed secondary school
curriculum. One purpose of the study was to discover through
exploration and experimentation how secondary schools in the United
States could serve youth more effectively (Aikin 1942). Each
experimental school was free to change the curriculum as it saw fit,
but the schools agreed that teaching methods and the life of the
school should conform to the idea (previously advocated by Dewey) that
people develop through doing things that are meaningful to them, and
that the main purpose of the secondary school was to lead young people
to understand, appreciate and live the democratic way of life
characteristic of the United States (Aikin 1942: 17&ndash;18). In
particular, school officials believed that young people in a democracy
should develop the habit of reflective thinking and skill in solving
problems (Aikin 1942: 81). Students&rsquo; work in the classroom thus
consisted more often of a problem to be solved than a lesson to be
learned. Especially in mathematics and science, the schools made a
point of giving students experience in clear, logical thinking as they
solved problems. The report of one experimental school, the University
School of Ohio State University, articulated this goal of improving
students&rsquo; thinking:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Critical or reflective thinking originates with the sensing of a
problem. It is a quality of thought operating in an effort to solve
the problem and to reach a tentative conclusion which is supported by
all available data. It is really a process of problem solving
requiring the use of creative insight, intellectual honesty, and sound
judgment. It is the basis of the method of scientific inquiry. The
success of democracy depends to a large extent on the disposition and
ability of citizens to think critically and reflectively about the
problems which must of necessity confront them, and to improve the
quality of their thinking is one of the major goals of education.
(Commission on the Relation of School and College of the Progressive
Education Association 1943: 745&ndash;746)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The Eight-Year Study had an evaluation staff, which developed, in
consultation with the schools, tests to measure aspects of student
progress that fell outside the focus of the traditional curriculum.
The evaluation staff classified many of the schools&rsquo; stated
objectives under the generic heading &ldquo;clear thinking&rdquo; or
&ldquo;critical thinking&rdquo; (Smith, Tyler, &amp; Evaluation Staff
1942: 35&ndash;36). To develop tests of achievement of this broad
goal, they distinguished five overlapping aspects of it: ability to
interpret data, abilities associated with an understanding of the
nature of proof, and the abilities to apply principles of science, of
social studies and of logical reasoning. The Eight-Year Study also had
a college staff, directed by a committee of college administrators,
whose task was to determine how well the experimental schools had
prepared their graduates for college. The college staff compared the
performance of 1,475 college students from the experimental schools
with an equal number of graduates from conventional schools, matched
in pairs by sex, age, race, scholastic aptitude scores, home and
community background, interests, and probable future. They concluded
that, on 18 measures of student success, the graduates of the
experimental schools did a somewhat better job than the comparison
group. The graduates from the six most traditional of the experimental
schools showed no large or consistent differences. The graduates from
the six most experimental schools, on the other hand, had much greater
differences in their favour. The graduates of the two most
experimental schools, the college staff reported:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
&hellip; surpassed their comparison groups by wide margins in academic
achievement, intellectual curiosity, scientific approach to problems,
and interest in contemporary affairs. The differences in their favor
were even greater in general resourcefulness, in enjoyment of reading,
[in] participation in the arts, in winning non-academic honors, and in
all aspects of college life except possibly participation in sports
and social activities. (Aikin 1942: 114)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
One of these schools was a private school with students from
privileged families and the other the experimental section of a public
school with students from non-privileged families. The college staff
reported that the graduates of the two schools were indistinguishable
from each other in terms of college success.</p>

<p>
In 1933 Dewey issued an extensively rewritten edition of his <em>How
We Think</em> (Dewey 1910), with the sub-title &ldquo;A restatement of
the relation of reflective thinking to the educative process&rdquo;.
Although the restatement retains the basic structure and content of
the original book, Dewey made a number of changes. He rewrote and
simplified his logical analysis of the process of reflection, made his
ideas clearer and more definite, replaced the terms
&lsquo;induction&rsquo; and &lsquo;deduction&rsquo; by the phrases
&lsquo;control of data and evidence&rsquo; and &lsquo;control of
reasoning and concepts&rsquo;, added more illustrations, rearranged
chapters, and revised the parts on teaching to reflect changes in
schools since 1910. In particular, he objected to one-sided practices
of some &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; and &ldquo;progressive&rdquo;
schools that allowed children freedom but gave them no guidance,
citing as objectionable practices novelty and variety for their own
sake, experiences and activities with real materials but of no
educational significance, treating random and disconnected activity as
if it were an experiment, failure to summarize net accomplishment at
the end of an inquiry, non-educative projects, and treatment of the
teacher as a negligible factor rather than as &ldquo;the intellectual
leader of a social group&rdquo; (Dewey 1933: 273). Without explaining
his reasons, Dewey eliminated the previous edition&rsquo;s uses of the
words &lsquo;critical&rsquo; and &lsquo;uncritical&rsquo;, thus
settling firmly on &lsquo;reflection&rsquo; or &lsquo;reflective
thinking&rsquo; as the preferred term for his subject-matter. In the
revised edition, the word &lsquo;critical&rsquo; occurs only once,
where Dewey writes that &ldquo;a person may not be sufficiently
<em>critical</em> about the ideas that occur to him&rdquo; (1933: 16,
italics in original); being critical is thus a component of
reflection, not the whole of it. In contrast, the Eight-Year Study by
the Progressive Education Association treated &lsquo;critical
thinking&rsquo; and &lsquo;reflective thinking&rsquo; as synonyms.</p>

<p>
In the same period, Dewey collaborated on a history of the Laboratory
School in Chicago with two former teachers from the school (Mayhew
&amp; Edwards 1936). The history describes the school&rsquo;s
curriculum and organization, activities aimed at developing skills,
parents&rsquo; involvement, and the habits of mind that the children
acquired. A concluding chapter evaluates the school&rsquo;s
achievements, counting as a success its staging of the curriculum to
correspond to the natural development of the growing child. In two
appendices, the authors describe the evolution of Dewey&rsquo;s
principles of education and Dewey himself describes the theory of the
Chicago experiment (Dewey 1936).</p>

<p>
Glaser (1941) reports in his doctoral dissertation the method and
results of an experiment in the development of critical thinking
conducted in the fall of 1938. He defines critical thinking as Dewey
defined reflective thinking: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Critical thinking calls for a persistent effort to examine any belief
or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that
supports it and the further conclusions to which it tends. (Glaser
1941: 6; cf. Dewey 1910: 6; Dewey 1933: 9) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the experiment, eight lesson units directed at improving critical
thinking abilities were taught to four grade 12 high school classes,
with pre-test and post-test of the students using the Otis
Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Test and the Watson-Glaser Tests of
Critical Thinking (developed in collaboration with Glaser&rsquo;s
dissertation sponsor, Goodwin Watson). The average gain in scores on
these tests was greater to a statistically significant degree among
the students who received the lessons in critical thinking than among
the students in a control group of four grade 12 high school classes
taking the usual curriculum in English. Glaser concludes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The aspect of critical thinking which appears most susceptible to
general improvement is the attitude of being disposed to consider in a
thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of
one&rsquo;s experience. An attitude of wanting evidence for beliefs is
more subject to general transfer. Development of skill in applying the
methods of logical inquiry and reasoning, however, appears to be
specifically related to, and in fact limited by, the acquisition of
pertinent knowledge and facts concerning the problem or subject matter
toward which the thinking is to be directed. (Glaser 1941: 175)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Retest scores and observable behaviour indicated that students in the
intervention group retained their growth in ability to think
critically for at least six months after the special instruction.</p>

<p>
In 1948 a group of U.S. college examiners decided to develop
taxonomies of educational objectives with a common vocabulary that
they could use for communicating with each other about test items. The
first of these taxonomies, for the cognitive domain, appeared in 1956
(Bloom et al. 1956), and included critical thinking objectives. It has
become known as Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy. A second taxonomy, for the
affective domain (Krathwohl, Bloom, &amp; Masia 1964), and a third
taxonomy, for the psychomotor domain (Simpson 1966&ndash;67), appeared
later. Each of the taxonomies is hierarchical, with achievement of a
higher educational objective alleged to require achievement of
corresponding lower educational objectives.</p>

<p>
Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy has six major categories. From lowest to
highest, they are knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis,
synthesis, and evaluation. Within each category, there are
sub-categories, also arranged hierarchically from the educationally
prior to the educationally posterior. The lowest category, though
called &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo;, is confined to objectives of
remembering information and being able to recall or recognize it,
without much transformation beyond organizing it (Bloom et al. 1956:
28&ndash;29). The five higher categories are collectively termed
&ldquo;intellectual abilities and skills&rdquo; (Bloom et al. 1956:
204). The term is simply another name for critical thinking abilities
and skills:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Although information or knowledge is recognized as an important
outcome of education, very few teachers would be satisfied to regard
this as the primary or the sole outcome of instruction. What is needed
is some evidence that the students can do something with their
knowledge, that is, that they can apply the information to new
situations and problems. It is also expected that students will
acquire generalized techniques for dealing with new problems and new
materials. Thus, it is expected that when the student encounters a new
problem or situation, he will select an appropriate technique for
attacking it and will bring to bear the necessary information, both
facts and principles. This has been labeled &ldquo;critical
thinking&rdquo; by some, &ldquo;reflective thinking&rdquo; by Dewey
and others, and &ldquo;problem solving&rdquo; by still others. In the
taxonomy, we have used the term &ldquo;intellectual abilities and
skills&rdquo;. (Bloom et al. 1956: 38)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Comprehension and application objectives, as their names imply,
involve understanding and applying information. Critical thinking
abilities and skills show up in the three highest categories of
analysis, synthesis and evaluation. The condensed version of
Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy (Bloom et al. 1956: 201&ndash;207) gives the
following examples of objectives at these levels:</p>

<ul class="hanging">

<li> <em>analysis objectives</em>: ability to recognize unstated
assumptions, ability to check the consistency of hypotheses with given
information and assumptions, ability to recognize the general
techniques used in advertising, propaganda and other persuasive
materials</li>

<li> <em>synthesis objectives</em>: organizing ideas and statements in
writing, ability to propose ways of testing a hypothesis, ability to
formulate and modify hypotheses</li>

<li> <em>evaluation objectives</em>: ability to indicate logical
fallacies, comparison of major theories about particular cultures</li>
</ul>

<p>
The analysis, synthesis and evaluation objectives in Bloom&rsquo;s
taxonomy collectively came to be called the &ldquo;higher-order
thinking skills&rdquo; (Tankersley 2005: chap. 5). Although the
analysis-synthesis-evaluation sequence mimics phases in Dewey&rsquo;s
(1933) logical analysis of the reflective thinking process, it has not
generally been adopted as a model of a critical thinking process.
While commending the inspirational value of its ratio of five
categories of thinking objectives to one category of recall
objectives, Ennis (1981b) points out that the categories lack criteria
applicable across topics and domains. For example, analysis in
chemistry is so different from analysis in literature that there is
not much point in teaching analysis as a general type of thinking.
Further, the postulated hierarchy seems questionable at the higher
levels of Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy. For example, ability to indicate
logical fallacies hardly seems more complex than the ability to
organize statements and ideas in writing.</p>

<p>
A revised version of Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy (Anderson et al. 2001)
distinguishes the intended cognitive process in an educational
objective (such as being able to recall, to compare or to check) from
the objective&rsquo;s informational content (&ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;),
which may be factual, conceptual, procedural, or metacognitive. The
result is a so-called &ldquo;Taxonomy Table&rdquo; with four rows for
the kinds of informational content and six columns for the six main
types of cognitive process. The authors name the types of cognitive
process by verbs, to indicate their status as mental activities. They
change the name of the &lsquo;comprehension&rsquo; category to
&lsquo;understand&rsquo; and of the &lsquo;synthesis&rsquo; category
to &rsquo;create&rsquo;, and switch the order of synthesis and
evaluation. The result is a list of six main types of cognitive
process aimed at by teachers: remember, understand, apply, analyze,
evaluate, and create. The authors retain the idea of a hierarchy of
increasing complexity, but acknowledge some overlap, for example
between understanding and applying. And they retain the idea that
critical thinking and problem solving cut across the more complex
cognitive processes. The terms &lsquo;critical thinking&rsquo; and
&lsquo;problem solving&rsquo;, they write:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
are widely used and tend to become touchstones of curriculum emphasis.
Both generally include a variety of activities that might be
classified in disparate cells of the Taxonomy Table. That is, in any
given instance, objectives that involve problem solving and critical
thinking most likely call for cognitive processes in several
categories on the process dimension. For example, to think critically
about an issue probably involves some Conceptual knowledge to Analyze
the issue. Then, one can Evaluate different perspectives in terms of
the criteria and, perhaps, Create a novel, yet defensible perspective
on this issue. (Anderson et al. 2001: 269&ndash;270; italics in
original)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In the revised taxonomy, only a few sub-categories, such as inferring,
have enough commonality to be treated as a distinct critical thinking
ability that could be taught and assessed as a general ability.</p>

<p>
A landmark contribution to philosophical scholarship on the concept of
critical thinking was a 1962 article in the <em>Harvard Educational
Review</em> by Robert H. Ennis, with the title &ldquo;A concept of
critical thinking: A proposed basis for research in the teaching and
evaluation of critical thinking ability&rdquo; (Ennis 1962). Ennis
took as his starting-point a conception of critical thinking put
forward by B. Othanel Smith:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
We shall consider thinking in terms of the operations involved in the
examination of statements which we, or others, may believe. A speaker
declares, for example, that &ldquo;Freedom means that the decisions in
America&rsquo;s productive effort are made not in the minds of a
bureaucracy but in the free market&rdquo;. Now if we set about to find
out what this statement means and to determine whether to accept or
reject it, we would be engaged in thinking which, for lack of a better
term, we shall call critical thinking. If one wishes to say that this
is only a form of problem-solving in which the purpose is to decide
whether or not what is said is dependable, we shall not object. But
for our purposes we choose to call it critical thinking. (Smith 1953:
130)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Adding a normative component to this conception, Ennis defined
critical thinking as &ldquo;the correct assessing of statements&rdquo;
(Ennis 1962: 83). On the basis of this definition, he distinguished 12
&ldquo;aspects&rdquo; of critical thinking corresponding to types or
aspects of statements, such as judging whether an observation
statement is reliable and grasping the meaning of a statement. He
noted that he did not include judging value statements. Cutting across
the 12 aspects, he distinguished three dimensions of critical
thinking: logical (judging relationships between meanings of words and
statements), criterial (knowledge of the criteria for judging
statements), and pragmatic (the impression of the background purpose).
For each aspect, Ennis described the applicable dimensions, including
criteria. He proposed the resulting construct as a basis for
developing specifications for critical thinking tests and for research
on instructional methods and levels.</p>

<p>
In the 1970s and 1980s there was an upsurge of attention to the
development of thinking skills. The annual International Conference on
Critical Thinking and Educational Reform has attracted since its start
in 1980 tens of thousands of educators from all levels. In 1983 the
College Entrance Examination Board proclaimed reasoning as one of six
basic academic competencies needed by college students (College Board
1983). Departments of education in the United States and around the
world began to include thinking objectives in their curriculum
guidelines for school subjects. For example, Ontario&rsquo;s social
sciences and humanities curriculum guideline for secondary schools
requires &ldquo;the use of critical and creative thinking skills
and/or processes&rdquo; as a goal of instruction and assessment in
each subject and course (Ontario Ministry of Education 2013: 30). The
document describes critical thinking as follows:</p>

Critical thinking is the process of thinking about ideas or situations
in order to understand them fully, identify their implications, make a
judgement, and/or guide decision making. Critical thinking includes
skills such as questioning, predicting, analysing, synthesizing,
examining opinions, identifying values and issues, detecting bias, and
distinguishing between alternatives. Students who are taught these
skills become critical thinkers who can move beyond superficial
conclusions to a deeper understanding of the issues they are
examining. They are able to engage in an inquiry process in which they
explore complex and multifaceted issues, and questions for which there
may be no clear-cut answers (Ontario Ministry of Education 2013:
46).</p>

Sweden makes schools responsible for ensuring that each pupil who
completes compulsory school &ldquo;can make use of critical thinking
and independently formulate standpoints based on knowledge and ethical
considerations&rdquo; (Skolverket 2011: 15). Subject syllabi
incorporate this requirement, and items testing critical thinking
skills appear on national tests in history, Swedish, mathematics and
physics that are a required step toward university admission. For
example, the physics syllabus emphasizes the importance of
&ldquo;critical examination of information and arguments which
students meet in sources and social discussions related to
physics&rdquo; (Skolverket 2011: 124). Correspondingly, the 2013
national test on physics included a question asking students to
provide arguments for a recommendation to the Swedish minister of
energy on what energy sources to use for electricity production. Other
jurisdictions similarly embed critical thinking objectives in
curriculum guidelines.</p>

At the college level, a new wave of introductory logic textbooks,
pioneered by Kahane (1971), applied the tools of logic to contemporary
social and political issues. In their wake, colleges and universities
in North America transformed their introductory logic course into a
general education service course with a title like &lsquo;critical
thinking&rsquo; or &lsquo;reasoning&rsquo;. In 1980, the trustees of
California&rsquo;s state university and colleges approved as a general
education requirement a course in critical thinking, described as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Instruction in critical thinking is to be designed to achieve an
understanding of the relationship of language to logic, which should
lead to the ability to analyze, criticize, and advocate ideas, to
reason inductively and deductively, and to reach factual or judgmental
conclusions based on sound inferences drawn from unambiguous
statements of knowledge or belief. The minimal competence to be
expected at the successful conclusion of instruction in critical
thinking should be the ability to distinguish fact from judgment,
belief from knowledge, and skills in elementary inductive and
deductive processes, including an understanding of the formal and
informal fallacies of language and thought. (Dumke 1980)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Since December 1983, the Association for Informal Logic and Critical
Thinking has sponsored sessions at the three annual divisional
meetings of the American Philosophical Association. In December 1987,
the Committee on Pre-College Philosophy of the American Philosophical
Association invited Peter Facione to make a systematic inquiry into
the current state of critical thinking and critical thinking
assessment. Facione assembled a group of 46 other academic
philosophers and psychologists to participate in a multi-round Delphi
process, whose product was entitled <em>Critical Thinking: A Statement
of Expert Consensus for Purposes of Educational Assessment and
Instruction</em> (Facione 1990a). The statement listed abilities and
dispositions that should be the goals of a lower-level undergraduate
course in critical thinking.</p>

Contemporary political and business leaders express support for
critical thinking as an educational goal. In his 2014 State of the
Union address (Obama 2014), U.S. President Barack Obama listed
critical thinking as one of six skills for the new economy targeted
with his Race to the Top program. An article in the business magazine
<em>Forbes</em> reported that the number one job skill, found in nine
out of 10 of the most in-demand jobs, was critical thinking, defined
as &ldquo;using logic and reasoning to identify the strengths and
weaknesses of alternative solutions, conclusions or approaches to
problems&rdquo; (Casserly 2012). In response to such claims, the
European Commission has funded &ldquo;Critical Thinking across the
European Higher Education Curricula&rdquo;, a nine-country research
project to develop guidelines for quality in critical thinking
instruction in European institutions of higher education, on the basis
of the researchers&rsquo; findings of the critical thinking skills and
dispositions that employers expect of recent graduates (Dominguez
2018a; 2018b). The Centre for Educational Research and Innovation of
the Organization for Economic Development (OECD) in early 2018 issued
a call for institutions of higher education to participate in a
two-year study, with control groups, of interventions in undergraduate
or teacher education designed to improve creative and critical
thinking (OECD Centre for Educational Research and Innovation
2018).</p>

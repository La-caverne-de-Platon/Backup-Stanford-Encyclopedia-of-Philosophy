<h1>Policy on Course Readers</h1>

<p>

Entries in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy are freely
available in HTML from
 <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/">https://plato.stanford.edu/</a>,
and PDF versions may be obtained as a benefit of membership in the
Friends of the SEP Society at 
 <a href="https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/">http://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/</a>.
There are three options open to those course instructors who wish to
include a reprint of an SEP entry in a course reader. These options
are governed by SEP policies, and the policies were developed to
protect the long-term sustainability of the SEP.  Basically, if you
want to distribute printed copies of an SEP entry in a course reader
(i.e., distribute a photocopied printout of the HTML or PDF version),
you will need permission of the author. By contrast, the
electronic distribution of SEP entries in course readers (via the internet, e.g., web,
email, etc.), is restricted.  The SEP rarely grants permission for such
electronic distribution, for the reasons explained in Section 3 below.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#option">1. The Options</a></li>
<li><a href="#policies">2. The Policies Behind the Options</a></li>
<li><a href="#rationale">3. The Rationale Behind the Policies</a></li>
</ul>


<h2><a id="options">1. The Options</a></h2>

<h3>Option #1: Point students to the free version</h3>

<p>Instead of including SEP entries in course readers, point your
students to the free HTML version at
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/<i>entryname</i>/.  Students may
prefer to read that version on their computer screen without incurring
any costs. Alternatively, they may be able to print that version more
cheaply than the amount you would be charging for reproducing those
pages in your course reader. Indeed, they can print in their preferred
font and font size.  Note that since each student may have set his/her
browser to to a different default font and size, pagination on their
own printouts might vary, and so when you discuss passages in SEP
entries in class, you should those passages by section, subsection,
and paragraph number.</p>

<h3>Option #2: Include a printout of the HTML version in course reader</h3>

<ol>

<li>Write to the author to obtain permission to distribute photocopies
of his or her entry. There is a link to the author's email address in
the entry footer (i.e., in the brown band at the very bottom of the
entry).</li>

<li>If the author gives you permission, print out the HTML version
from
  <blockquote>
  https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/<i>entryname</i>/ 
  </blockquote>

<p>[Note that this may involve handling <b>several HTML files</b>,
since some SEP entries include footnotes and supplementary documents
which are separate HTML files. (This isn't an issue with Option #3
below, since the PDF versions of SEP entries combine all the
supplementary documents into a single downloadable file.)</p></li>

<li>Photocopy the printout for inclusion in the course reader.</li>

<li>Since your browser may not stamp the URL of the HTML entry on the
printout, be sure to include a title page that cites the URL, by
following our guidelines at
  <blockquote>
 <a href="cite.html">https://plato.stanford.edu/cite.html</a>
  </blockquote>

<p>or by following the instructions in the &ldquo;Cite This
Entry&rdquo; link displayed at the top left corner of the Navigation
Panel when viewing an entry.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><b>The instructor may not distribute the HTML to the students
electronically over the Internet</b> (e.g., via email or by posting it
on his/her webpage or coursepage) but is encouraged to
provide students with a link to the free copy at</p>
  <blockquote>
  https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/<i>entryname</i>/
  </blockquote>

<p>Note: On this option, the instructor would be asking the students
to pay for something (namely, the printed copy of the SEP entry in the
course reader) the content of which can be freely accessed in HTML
using their web browsers.</p>

<h3>Option #3: Include a printout of the PDF version in the course reader</h3>

<ol>

<li>Write to the author to obtain permission to distribute photocopies
of his or her entry. There is a link to the author's email address in
the entry footer (i.e., in the brown band at the very bottom of the
entry).</li>

<li>If the author gives you permission to distribute photocopies, join
(if you aren't already a member of) the Friends of the SEP Society
(<a href="https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/join/">https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/join/</a>)
as an Associate Member ($10/year) or Professional Member
($25/year).</li>

<li>Log in to the Friends Society and download a PDF version of an SEP
entry.</li>

<li>Provide that PDF version to the course-reader producer for
printing/photocopying and inclusion in the course reader.</li>

</ol>

<p><b>The instructor may not distribute the PDF to the students
electronically over the Internet</b> (e.g., via email or by posting it
on his/her webpage or coursepage) but is encouraged to provide
students with a link to the free copy at</p>

  <blockquote>
  https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/<i>entryname</i>/
  </blockquote>

<p>This option doesn't entail that the students will have to pay for
something they can freely download from the Internet, since these PDF
versions are available only to those who pay membership dues to join
the Friends of the SEP Society.</p>

<h2><a id="policies">2. The Policies Behind the Options</a></h2>

<p>

The SEP holds the exclusive right to distribute copies of SEP entries
in HTML or PDF electronically via the Internet or World Wide Web.  SEP
authors, however, retain copyright over the <em>printed</em>
and <em>reprinted</em> versions of their entries, and they are free to
republish them in print media and grant you permission for
reproduction in a course reader. Our full copyright policies are
stated on the following pages:</p>

<ul>
<li>HTML Copyright Policy: <br/>
    <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/info.html#c">https://plato.stanford.edu/info.html#c</a></li>
<li>PDF Copyright Policy:  <br/>
   <a href="https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/info/copyright/">https://leibniz.stanford.edu/friends/info/copyright/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
Consequently, anyone who wishes to include a <em>printed</em> copy of
the HTML or PDF version of an SEP entry must obtain permission of the
author before such a copy may be included in a course reader.
However, a printed collection consisting solely of entries from the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy is a special case, and for such a
collection, you would have to apply to the SEP editors about copyright
matters.  The underlying theme behind the above policies is that the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy project and its mirror sites have
the exclusive right and authority to distribute electronic HTML and
PDF files of SEP entries over the Internet. </p>


<h2><a id="rationale">3. The Rationale Behind the Policies</a></h2>

<p>There are reasons why our copyright policy does not allow authors,
course instructors, or anyone else to deliver SEP entries
electronically over the internet (e.g., through a web server or via
email).  The principal problem is that it negatively affects the
long-term survival of the SEP.  The long-term survival of the SEP
depends in part on the impact it has.  The greater its impact, the
more libraries will join to support it.  By distributing SEP entries
electronically from another server or via email, one would diminish
our impact in several ways. First, not as many people would be
accessing our servers.  This reduced access count on our server logs
would indicate that we are having less of an impact. Second (for the
case where one puts the SEP entry up on a local university web page or
private home page), readers would be able to create links to the page
on your server instead of creating links to the page on our server.
This reduces our impact at Google, which ranks our page (on a list of
matches to a keyword search) on the basis of how many links there are
to it on the web.  Google has become a de facto measure of
authoritativeness on the web.  In addition to these problems, you also
make it more difficult to assess the particular impact your entry is
having, since we can no longer easily count and compile all the
accesses to it.</p>

<p>There are two other problems with putting an entry on another
server: (1) Changes could be made to the version on the other server
without going through our referee process.  This undermines the
&ldquo;imprimatur&rdquo; of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
(authors might add content to the other version that was not
acceptable to our referees, and people wouldn't necessarily know what
the differences are between the two versions). (2) There would no
longer be a single stable citation path &mdash; each non-affiliated
server which serves the entry introduces a new citation path.  People
might not know which of these is the official version and it
introduces confusion as to the provenance of the piece.</p>

<p>Finally, we note that &ldquo;re-publication&rdquo; of web materials
is not the same as re-publication of print materials.  The
re-publication of print materials really does make them more
accessible and the extra copies helps to ensure preservation for the
long term.  However, there is no increase in accessibility by putting
copies on other servers, since <em>everyone</em> can access our
servers, which are available 24/7/365, and we have 3 mirror sites also
available 24/7/365.  Nor is there a benefit to the long-term
preservation of the entries: our servers, and all of our mirror site
servers, have backups, and all the libraries that have supported the
SEP by joining SEPIA are entitled to download copies of our
archives.</p>

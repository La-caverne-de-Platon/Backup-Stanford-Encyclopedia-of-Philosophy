<h1>Large Cardinals and Determinacy</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed May 22, 2013</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>
The developments of set theory in 1960's led to an era of independence
in which many of the central questions were shown to be unresolvable
on the basis of the standard system of mathematics, ZFC. This is true
of statements from areas as diverse as analysis (&ldquo;Are all
projective sets Lebesgue measurable?&rdquo;), cardinal arithmetic
(&ldquo;Does Cantor's Continuum Hypothesis (CH) hold?&rdquo;),
combinatorics (&ldquo;Does Suslin's Hypotheses hold?&rdquo;), and
group theory (&ldquo;Is there a Whitehead group?&rdquo;). </p>

<p>
 These developments gave rise to two conflicting positions. The
first position&mdash;which we shall
call <em>pluralism</em>&mdash;maintains that the independence results
largely undermine the enterprise of set theory as an objective
enterprise. On this view, although there are <em>practical</em>
reasons that one might give in favour of one set of axioms over
another&mdash;say, that it is more useful for a given task&mdash;,
there are no <em>theoretical</em> reasons that can be given; and,
moreover, this either implies or is a consequence of the
fact&mdash;depending on the variant of the view, in particular,
whether it places realism before reason, or conversely&mdash;that
there is no objective mathematical realm at this level. The second
position&mdash;which we shall
call <em>non-pluralism</em>&mdash;maintains that the independence
results merely indicate the paucity of our standard resources for
justifying mathematical statements. On this view, theoretical
reasons <em>can</em> be given for new axioms and&mdash;again,
depending on the variant of the view&mdash;this either implies or is a
consequence of the fact that there is an objective mathematical realm
at this level. </p>

<p>
 The theoretical reasons for new axioms that the non-pluralist
gives are quite different that the theoretical reasons that are
customarily at play in mathematics, in part because, having stepped
into the realm of independence, a more subtle form of justification is
required, one that relies more heavily on sophisticated mathematical
machinery. The dispute between the pluralist and the non-pluralist is
thus one that lies at the intersection of philosophy and
mathematics&mdash;on the one hand, it is intimately connected with
some of the central questions of philosophy of mathematics, such as
the question of realism and the nature of justification; on the other
hand, it addresses these questions in a manner that is sensitive to a
great deal of sophisticated mathematics. </p>

<p>
 The debate between the pluralist and the non-pluralist is really a
hierarchy of debates. At the one extreme there is pluralism with
regard to <em>all</em> of mathematics and at the other extreme there
is <em>non</em>-pluralism with regard to all of mathematics. The
intermediate positions (which are much more common) involve embracing
non-pluralism for certain domains (say first-order arithmetic), while
advocating pluralism with regard to others (say those where the notion
of the full powerset enters the picture). Fortunately, the
mathematical systems that arise in practice can be arranged in a
well-founded hierarchy&mdash;ranging from weak systems like Robinson's
arithmetic Q, up through Peano arithmetic PA, the subsystems of
second-order arithmetic, the subsystems of set theory, and the
hierarchy of large cardinal axioms. One can thus arrange the hybrid
non-pluralist/pluralist positions and the corresponding debates in a
well-founded hierarchy, where along the way one embraces more and more
non-pluralism. The challenge for those with non-pluralist tendencies
is to make the case that non-pluralism extends further and further
into the upper reaches of higher mathematics. The challenge for those
with pluralist tendencies is to draw the line in a principled manner
and make the case that no argument for non-pluralism will succeed for
the domains of mathematics beyond that line. </p>

<p>
 It is sensible to approach the search for new axioms and the
question of pluralism in a stepwise fashion, seeking first axioms that
resolve certain low-level questions and making the case for
non-pluralism at that level, and then proceeding upward to questions
of greater complexity and the question of pluralism at higher
levels. The present entry focuses on this debate as it takes place in
the setting of <em>classical descriptive set theory</em>. There are
three reasons for this choice. First, a popular view embraces
non-pluralism for first-order arithmetic but rejects the search for
new axioms for full second-order arithmetic and set theory and
embraces pluralism at these 
 levels.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#1" name="note-1">1</a>]</sup> 
 The questions of descriptive set theory are
important in this connection since many of them are statements of
second-order arithmetic which are independent of the standard axioms,
ZFC. It thus represents a critical juncture in the debate between the
pluralist and non-pluralist. Second, here the mathematical landscape
with regard to the implications of new axioms has largely stabilized
and we now have the resources required to address the issue between
the pluralist and the non-pluralist. (In the case of questions of
third- and higher-order arithmetic the matter still awaits further
mathematical developments. That topic is treated in the entry
 &ldquo;<a href="../continuum-hypothesis/index.html">The Continuum Hypothesis</a>&rdquo;.)  
Finally, the case for new axioms at this level involves so-called
&ldquo;extrinsic justifications&rdquo; (something we shall describe
below) and, moreover, provides the strongest current example of such
justifications. </p>

<p>
 Here is an overview of the present
entry: <a href="#PhiMot">Section 1</a> provides further philosophical
motivation and sharpens the question of pluralism by briefly
discussing the interpretability hierarchy, the incompleteness
phenomenon, and the nature of axioms.
 <a href="#ClaDesSetThe">Section 2</a>
 describes the central notions and results of classical
descriptive set theory along with the independence results concerning
the questions that remained open and were ultimately shown to be
unresolvable on the basis of the standard axioms,
ZFC. <a href="#DetLarCar">Section 3</a> describes the two main
approaches to new axioms&mdash;axioms of definable determinacy and
large cardinal axioms&mdash;and discusses the implications of these
axioms for the undecided questions of classical descriptive set
theory. <a href="#CasForDefDet">Section 4</a> treats of the intimate
relationship between the two approaches and outlines the case that has
been made for axioms of definable determinacy and large cardinal
axioms. <a href="#PhiDis">Section 5</a> revisits the debate between

<h2><a name="PhiMot">1.  Philosophical Motivation</a></h2>

<p>
One way to sharpen the question of pluralism involves appeal to the
interpretability hierarchy. In this section we will (1) introduce the
interpretability hierarchy, (2) briefly discuss the incompleteness
phenomenon, (3) sharpen the question of pluralism, and (4) bring out
the philosophical issues involved by briefly discussing the nature of
axioms and the nature of justification in mathematics. </p>

<h3><a name="IntHie">1.1  Interpretability Hierarchy</a></h3>

<p>
Suppose <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> are
recursively enumerable axiom systems. We say that <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>
is <em>interpretable</em> in <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>
(<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> &le; <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>) when, roughly
speaking, there is a translation &tau; from the language
of <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> to the language of <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> such
that, for each sentence &#981; of the language
of <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>, if <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> &#8866; &#981;
then <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> &#8866; &tau;(&#981;). We shall
write <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> &lt; <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>
when <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> &le; <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>
and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> &#8816; <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and we shall
write <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> &equiv; <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> when
both <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> &le; <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>
and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> &le; <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>. In the latter
case, <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> are said to
be <em>mutually interpretable.</em> The equivalence class of all
theories mutually interpretable with <i>T</i> is called
the <em>interpretability degree
of</em> <i>T</i>. The <em>interpretability hierarchy</em> is the
collection of all theories ordered under the relation &le;. </p>

<p>
 There is a useful characterization of the relation &le; that
applies when it is restricted to the type of theories that we will be
considering. To describe this we need a few more notions. A
theory <i>T</i> is <em>reflexive</em> provided it proves the
consistency of each of its finite fragments, it
is <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span><em>-complete</em>
provided it proves each
true <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-statement,
and it
is <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span><em>-sound</em>
provided it does not prove a
false <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-statement. Let
&lsquo;<i>T</i><sub>1</sub>
&sube;<sub><span class="nw">&Pi;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span></sub> <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>&rsquo;
be shorthand for the statement that
all <span class="nw">&Pi;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-sentences
provable in <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> are provable
in <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>. The following characterization of
interpretability is central to the theory of interpretability:
If <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> is reflexive
and <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-complete,
then </p>

<blockquote><i>T</i><sub>1</sub> &le; <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>
iff <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>
&sube;<sub><span class="nw">&Pi;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span></sub> <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>.</blockquote>

<p>
 This result is due to Orey and H&aacute;jek (for further details
see Theorem 6 on p. 103 of Lindstr&ouml;m (2003) and Fact 3.2 of
Visser (1998)). It follows from this result and the second
incompleteness theorem that for any theory <i>T</i> meeting these two
conditions, the theory <i>T</i> + Con(<i>T</i>) is strictly stronger
than <i>T</i>, that is, <i>T</i> &lt; <i>T</i> +
Con(<i>T</i>). Moreover, it follows from the arithmetized completeness
theorem that the <i>T</i> + &not;Con(<i>T</i>) is interpretable
in <i>T</i>, hence, <i>T</i> &equiv; <i>T</i> + &not;Con(<i>T</i>)
(see Feferman 1960). </p>

<p>
 It turns out that the interpretability order is exceedingly
complex. For example, through the uses of metamathematical coding
techniques, one can show that for any two
theories <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> such
that <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> &lt; <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> there is a third
theory <i>T</i> such that <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> &lt; <i>T</i>
&lt; <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>. And for any theory <i>T</i>, one can show
that there are theories <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>
such that <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> &gt; <i>T</i> and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>
&gt; <i>T</i> and yet neither <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>
&le; <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> nor <i>T</i><sub>2</sub>
&le; <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> (that is, <i>T</i><sub>1</sub>
and <i>T</i><sub>2</sub> are above <i>T</i> and are incomparable in
the interpretability order). Thus, the order on the degrees of
interpretability is neither well-founded nor linearly ordered. </p>

<p>
 Nevertheless, when one restricts to theories that &ldquo;arise in
nature&rdquo; (that is, the kind of formal systems that one encounters
in a mathematical text as opposed to examples of the type above, which
are metamathematically manufactured by logicians to have the deviant
properties in question) the interpretability ordering is quite simple:
There are no descending chains and there are no incomparable
elements. In other words, it is a well-ordering. This is quite
remarkable: If one takes <em>any</em> two &ldquo;natural
theories&rdquo;&mdash;even from completely different domains, say one
from analysis and another from combinatorics&mdash;then generally it
turns out that one is interpretable in the other and that the two line
up along a well-founded path through the interpretability
hierarchy. </p>

<p>
 This well founded path through the interpretability hierarchy has
a canonical sequence through it which enables one to climb the
hierarchy in a principled manner. At the base one has the very weak
theory Q and one climbs upward by adding &ldquo;closure
principles&rdquo;. This starts with principles asserting that certain
fast-growing functions&mdash;exponentiation, super-exponentiation,
etc.&mdash;are total and it proceeds upward through set existence
principles, passing through the layers of second-order arithmetic, the
subsystems of set theory, and the hierarchy of large cardinal
axioms. </p>

<p>
 Of particular interest with regard to the question of pluralism
are those points along the well-founded sequence that correspond to
certain limitative conceptions of the nature of mathematics, such as
the degree marked by Q (Robinson Arithmetic,
which corresponds to <em>strict finitism</em>
in the sense articulated by Nelson), the degree marked by PRA (Primitive Recursive Arithmetic, which
corresponds to <em>finitism</em> in the sense articulated by Tait),
and the degree marked by ATR<sub>0</sub> (Arithmetical Transfinite Recursion, which corresponds
to <em>predicativism</em> in the sense articulated by Feferman). In
each case, one draws the line at a certain point in the hierarchy,
maintaining non-pluralism below and pluralism above. </p>

<p><em>Further Reading</em>: For a more detailed account of the
interpretability hierarchy see the entry 
 &ldquo;<a href="../independence-large-cardinals/index.html">Independence and Large Cardinals</a>&rdquo;. 
 For even further detail see Lindstr&ouml;m (2003) and Visser
(1998). </p>

<h3><a name="IndPhe">1.2  Independence Phenomenon</a></h3>

<p>
We noted above that the second incompleteness theorem provides us
with a case where the statement, namely, Con(<i>T</i>), leads to a
jump in the interpretability hierarchy while its negation does
not. There are also natural examples of this phenomenon&mdash;for
example, large cardinal axioms. When a statement &#981; is independent
of a theory <i>T</i> in this manner&mdash;that is, in virtue of the
fact that <i>T</i> &lt; <i>T</i> + &#981;&mdash;we shall refer to the
kind of independence involved as <em>vertical</em> independence. Thus,
the second incompleteness theorem demonstrated that Con(PA) is
vertically independent of PA (assuming, of course, that PA is
consistent) and that the large cardinal axioms &ldquo;There is a
strongly inaccessible cardinal&rdquo; is vertically independent of ZFC
(assuming that ZFC + &ldquo;There is a strongly inaccessible
cardinal&rdquo; is consistent). </p>

<p>
 In contrast to vertical independence there is the kind of
independence that arises when a sentence &#981; is independent of a
theory <i>T</i> because </p>

<blockquote><i>T</i> &equiv; <i>T</i> + &#981; and <i>T</i> &equiv; <i>T</i> + &not;&#981;.</blockquote>

<p>
 Such a sentence &#981; is called an <em>Orey sentence</em> with
respect to <i>T</i>. We shall refer to this kind of independence
as <em>horizontal</em> independence. Using metamathematical techniques
one can construct such sentences. But again, as in the case of
vertical independence, there are also natural non-metamathematical
examples&mdash;for example, PU (the statement that the projective sets
have the uniformization property, a property we shall discuss below)
is a statement of (schematic) second-order arithmetic that is an Orey
sentence with respect to ZFC, and CH is a statement of third-order
arithmetic that is an Orey sentence with respect to ZFC. </p>

<h3><a name="QuePlu">1.3  The Question of Pluralism</a></h3>

<p>
With these pieces in place we can now begin to sharpen the question
of pluralism. </p>

<p>
 As a first step we will restrict our attention to theories which
are formulated in a common language and our language of choice will be
the language of set theory. The reason for restricting to a common
language is that otherwise there will be theories which are merely
notational variants of one another. And the reason for focusing on the
language of set theory is that it is a universal language in the sense
that any system of mathematics is mutually interpretable with a theory
formulated in the language of set theory; for example, PA is mutually
interpretable with ZFC&minus;Infinity. We are thus setting aside the
question of pluralism as it might arise in a more metaphysical setting
where one considers questions such as whether natural numbers are
&ldquo;really&rdquo; sets or whether instead there are two distinct
domains of objects&mdash;natural numbers and the finite ordinals of
set theory. Our focus is on the question of pluralism as it arises in
response to the independence phenomenon and the issues at play in this
discussion are invariant across different stances on the above
metaphysical question. With regard to our question there is no loss of
generality in the restriction to the language of set theory since the
problem of finding new axioms for PA translates (through the natural
interpretation of number theory into set theory) into the problem of
finding new axioms for ZFC&minus;Infinity, and
conversely. Nevertheless, in what follows we shall, largely out of
convenience and familiarity, continue to speak of theories that are
formulated in other languages&mdash;such as Q and PA&mdash;but the
reader should always understand us to be strictly speaking of the
corresponding theory in the language of set theory. </p>

<p>
 The question of pluralism in its most general formulation is the
question of whether there is a correct path through the hierarchy of
interpretability or whether instead a multitude of mutually
incompatible theories must be admitted as equally legitimate from the
point of view of theoretical reason and mathematical truth. There are
really two problems that must be addressed. The first is the question
of how far the hierarchy of interpretability extends, that is, which
degrees are non-trivial in that the theories within them are
consistent. This is the <em>problem of consistency</em> (<em>or
non-triviality</em>). The second is the question of whether, for a
given (non-trivial) degree of interpretability, there are theoretical
reasons that can be given for one theory over another. This is
the <em>problem of selection</em>. If one managed to solve both
problems&mdash;determining the extent of the non-trivial degrees and
locating the correct path through them&mdash;then one would have
completely solved the problem of mathematical truth. There are,
however, two important things to stress about this. First, because of
the incompleteness theorems, any such solution would have to be
&ldquo;schematic&rdquo; concerning the first part (vertical
independence). Second, the solution to the full problem of selection
even for the degree of ZFC is a <em>very</em> difficult one since it
involves resolving CH and a multitude of other independent statements
that arise already at this level. </p>

<p>
 Because of the difficulty of the second problem it is useful to
split it up into its own hierarchy by classifying statements in terms
of their complexity. We shall discuss the hierarchy of statement
complexity in more detail in the next section. But for the moment
suffice it to say that (roughly speaking) one starts with questions of
second-order arithmetic (stratified according to their complexity) and
then one moves on to questions of third-order arithmetic (stratified
according to their complexity), and so on. Thus, one first tries to
solve the problem of selection at the level of, say, statements of
second-order arithmetic and then one moves on to the problem of
selection for statements of third-order arithmetic, and so on. The
question of pluralism that we will be addressing is located in the
hierarchy as follows: It takes a non-skeptical stance toward ZFC and
seeks axioms that solve the problem of selection for the level of
second-order arithmetic and somewhat
 beyond.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#2" name="note-2">2</a>]</sup> </p>

<p>
 Let us now give some examples of the various
pluralist/non-pluralist positions. At one extreme there is <em>radical
pluralism</em> which maintains that all non-trivial theories in the
interpretability hierarchy are on a par and that there are no
theoretical reasons that one can give for any theory over
another. This form of pluralism is difficult to articulate since, for
example, assuming that Q is consistent the theory Q + &not;Con(Q) is
consistent. But it is hard to see how the pluralist can admit this
theory as a legitimate candidate since it contains a
principle&mdash;namely, &not;Con(Q)&mdash;that is in conflict with the
background assumption that the pluralist employs in arguing that the
theory is a legitimate candidate. For this reason most people are
non-pluralists about some domains but remain pluralists about
others. </p>

<p>
 The limitative views that we mentioned earlier&mdash;strict
finitism, finitism, and predicativism&mdash;are examples of such
hybrid views. For example, strict finitists (on one construal) accept
Q and certain theories that are mutually interpretable with Q, thereby
adopting non-pluralism for this domain. In addition, the strict
finitist takes these theories to <em>exhaust</em> the domain of
objective mathematics and adopts a pluralist stance toward the
 remainder.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#3" name="note-3">3</a>]</sup> 
 In a
similar fashion, finitism and predicativism provide us with examples
of hybrid non-pluralist/pluralist positions. </p>

<p>
 Predicativism is of particular interest for our present purposes
since it grants the frameworks of the natural numbers but rejects most
of set theory and, in fact, most of second-order arithmetic. The
predicativist is a non-pluralist about first-order arithmetic and
thinks that there is an objective fact of the matter concerning every
statement formulated in the language of first-order arithmetic. And
the predicativist accepts as much of second-order arithmetic and set
theory that can be simulated in a theory such as ATR<sub>0</sub> (Arithemetical Transfinite Recursion). But
the predicativist remains a pluralist about what lies above. The
predicativist will often grant that there is utility in employing
axiomatic systems of set theory but will maintain that the issue of
truth does not arise at that level since there is no univocal
underlying conception of set. For example, the predicativist will
think that there is an objective choice between PA and PA +
&not;Con(PA) but not think that there is an objective choice between
PA<sub>2</sub> + PU and PA<sub>2</sub> + &not;PU (where here
PA<sub>2</sub> is (schematic) second-order arithmetic) or between ZFC
and ZFC + &ldquo;There are no strongly inaccessible
cardinals&rdquo;. Insofar as the predicativist thinks that the
independence results in set theory concerning second-order arithmetic
are a reason for endorsing pluralism about both ZFC and PA<sub>2</sub>
the non-pluralist case we shall present below is directly engaged with
the predicativist. But we should stress that for this discussion we
shall be presupposing ZFC and so the most direct brand of
non-pluralism/pluralism that we shall be engaged with is one that
takes a non-pluralist stance toward ZFC but a pluralist stance toward
statements like PU which are formally unresolvable on the basis of
ZFC. This is a fairly common view (see, for example, Shelah
(2003)). </p>

<h3><a name="NatAxi">1.4  The Nature of Axioms</a></h3>

<p>
The above characterization of the question of pluralism makes it
clear that it is closely connected with issues concerning the nature
of justification in mathematics. The most traditional form of
justification in mathematics involves justifying a statement by
proving it from the axioms. This then raises the question: What is the
source of the justification of the axioms? </p>

<p>
 The radical pluralist maintains that there is nothing that
justifies the axioms; rather they are simply postulates that one
adopts hypothetically for a given purpose. This view faces the
difficulty raised above. Most would maintain that axioms have a
privileged status and that this status is more than merely
hypothetical. </p>

<h4>1.4.1  The Evidentness Order</h4>

<p>
A popular view is that axioms are <em>self-evident</em> truths
concerning their domain. The difficulty with this view is that there
is wide disagreement in the foundations of mathematics as to which
statements are self-evident and if we restrict ourselves to the
intersection of the statements that <em>all</em> mathematicians would
regard as self-evident then the result will be quite limited in reach,
perhaps coinciding with Q or slightly
 more.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#4" name="note-4">4</a>]</sup> 
 Markov
had a similar complaint with the employment of the related notion of
being &ldquo;intuitively clear&rdquo;: </p>

<blockquote> <p>
I can in no way agree to taking &lsquo;intuitively
clear&rsquo; as a criterion of truth in mathematics, for this
criterion would mean the complete triumph of subjectivism and would
lead to a break with the understanding of science as a form of social
activity. (Markov (1962))</p>

</blockquote>

<p>For these reasons we will not employ the notion of self-evidence. </p>

<p>
 There is, however, a related notion that we shall employ, namely,
the notion of one statement being <em>more evident</em> than
another. In contrast to the case of self-evidence, there is generally
wide agreement (in the cases that concern us) on the question of what
is more evident than what. </p>

<p> To illustrate this it is best to give some examples. Consider the following equivalences: </p>
<ol>
<li>Over the base theory EFA (Exponential Function Arithmetic), the Finite Ramsey Theorem is equivalent to the totality of superexponentiation (see Friedman (2011), 
 &sect;0.5).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#5" name="note-5">5</a>]</sup>   </li>
<li>Over the base theory RCA<sub>0</sub> (Recursive Comprehension Axiom), the Hilbert Basis Theorem is equivalent to the statement that &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> is well-ordered (see Friedman (2011), &sect;0.6D). </li>
<li>Over the base theory ACA&prime; (Arithemetical Comprehension Axiom (with finite Turing Jumps for all reals)), Goodstein's Theorem and the Hydra Theorem are each equivalent to the <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-soundness of PA (see Friedman (2011), &sect;&sect;0.8B, 0.8E). </li>
<li>Over the base theory RCA<sub>0</sub>, Kruskal's Tree Theorem is equivalent to the statement that &theta;&Omega;<sub>&omega;</sub> is well-ordered (see Friedman (2011), &sect;0.9B). </li>
<li>Over the base theory ACA&prime;, the Exotic Case (of Boolean Relation Theory) is equivalent to the <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-soundness of SMAH (ZFC with strongly <i>n</i>-Mahlo cardinals) (see Friedman (2011), &sect;0.14C). </li>
</ol>

<p>
 In each of the above cases, the second statement is more evident
than the first and there is general agreement on this fact. For
example, the Hilbert Basis Theorem is far from immediate. It is the
sort of thing that we set out to prove from things that are more
evident. In contrast, the statement that &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> is
well-founded is something that becomes clear by reflecting on the
concepts involved. It is not the sort of thing that we set out to
prove from something more evident. This is what lies behind the fact
that the Hilbert Basis Theorem is called a theorem and not an
axiom. As one climbs up through the other examples, the asymmetry
becomes even more dramatic. For example, the Hydra Theorem and
Kruskal's Theorem are actually quite surprising and
counter-intuitive. These are definitely the sort of statements that
require proof on the basis of statements that are more evident. </p>

<p>
 We shall organize the statements in each interpretability degree
by the relation of being more evident than and we shall speak of the
collection of all statements so ordered as the <em>evidentness
order</em>. </p>

<p>
 A few words of caution are necessary concerning this
ordering. First, in saying that <i>X</i> is more evident than <i>Y</i>
we do not intend that <i>X</i> (or <i>Y</i>) is self-evident. To
underscore this point we will often use the expressions
&ldquo;<i>X</i> is prior to <i>Y</i> in the evidentness
order&rdquo;. Second, even in the case where <i>X</i> is minimal in
the evidentness order (within a given interpretability degree) we
refrain from saying that <i>X</i> is self-evident; indeed if the
degree is sufficiently high then this will not be the case. Third, the
evidentness order is to be understood as an epistemic order and not,
say, the order of conceptual complexity. Fourth, we are not saying
that every two statements <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are comparable in the
evidentness order. Indeed there are cases where there is not wide
agreement on how to compare two statements in this order. However, we
shall only employ the notion where there <em>is</em> wide
agreement. </p>

<p>
 In addition, one might raise skeptical worries about the
evidentness order. For example, perhaps judgments of the form
&ldquo;<i>X</i> is prior to <i>Y</i> in the evidentness order&rdquo;
are really just reflections of our mathematical training. The best way
to allay such concerns and test the robustness of the notion is to
examine examples. Compare, for example, the statement of the Hydra
Theorem and the statement that &#1013;<sub>0</sub> is well-ordered
with respect to primitive recursive relations (a weak
(semi-constructive) form of the statement that &#1013;<sub>0</sub> is
well-ordered). If you describe the relevant notions to a mathematician
or layperson who is not familiar with them then you will find the
following: There will be no expectation that Hercules wins the
Hydra. In fact, if you direct the person to one of the computer
programs (available online) that simulates the Hydra you will find
that they will be astounded at how fast the Hydra grows and if you
assure them that if they kept on playing&mdash;for a period of more
years than there are atoms in the physical universe (as currently
estimated)&mdash;the tides will eventually turn, they will make gains
and eventually cut the Hydra down to size, you will find that they
will look at you in amazement. This is something that needs proof. Now
if you describe to them the ordinals all the way up to
&#1013;<sub>0</sub> and you describe the notion of a well-ordering and
ask them whether &#1013;<sub>0</sub> is well-founded you will find
that the answer rests solely on whether they have grasped the object
in question. To come to the conclusion that &#1013;<sub>0</sub> is
well-founded one does not search for a proof from some other statement
which is more evident. Rather one works directly with the concepts
involved. The statement, as it were, rests on the legitimacy of the
underlying concepts and one comes to accept it by grasping those
concepts. It is here that the buck stops in the process of seeking
justification. And this is what we mean in saying that the statement
&ldquo;&#1013;<sub>0</sub> is well-ordered&rdquo; is minimal in the
evidentness order (of the degree of the Hydra Theorem). </p>

<p>
 In seeking axioms for theories within a given interpretability
 degree<sup>[<a href="notes.html#6" name="note-6">6</a>]</sup> 
 we seek
axioms that are as low as possible in the evidentness
order. Ultimately one would like to find axioms that
are <em>minimal</em> in the evidentness order. But questions remain:
(1) Can we be assured of finding minimal points that
are <em>secure</em>? The concern is that as one climbs up the
interpretability degrees the security of the minimal points will
weaken to the point where there would arguably be little security
left. To see this consider statements of the form &ldquo;&alpha; is
well-ordered&rdquo; where &alpha; is the proof-theoretic ordinal of
the interpretability degree. As one climbs the degrees one passes
through &#1013;<sub>0</sub>, &Gamma;<sub>0</sub>, and
&theta;&Omega;<sub>&omega;</sub>. This barely scratches the surface
and yet already the corresponding statements of wellfoundedness have
become less evident. This leads to the second question. (2) Is finding
a minimal point in the evidentness order (of a given interpretability
degree) the most one could hope for or are there other, more subtle
ways of accumulating evidence for axioms, ways that might further
buttress even the minimal points in the evidentness order (of a given
interpretability degree)? </p>

 

<h4>1.4.2  Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Justifications</h4>

<p>
There is a discussion of G&ouml;del that has bearing on each of
these questions, namely, his discussion of intrinsic and extrinsic
justifications in his classic paper (G&ouml;del (1947), expanded as
G&ouml;del (1964)). </p>

<p>
 In introducing the notion of an <em>intrinsic justification</em>
G&ouml;del gives as an example certain large cardinal axioms that are
just beyond the reach of ZFC: </p>

<blockquote> <p>
[The] axioms of set theory [ZFC] by no means form a
system closed in itself, but, quite on the contrary, the very concept
of set on which they are based suggests their extension by new axioms
which assert the existence of still further iterations of the
operation &ldquo;set of&rdquo; (260).</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
As examples he mentions the axioms asserting the existence of
inaccessible cardinals and Mahlo cardinals: </p>

<blockquote> <p>
These axioms show clearly, not only that the axiomatic
system of set theory as used today is incomplete, but also that it can
be supplemented without arbitrariness by new axioms which
only <em>unfold the content of the concept of set</em> as explained
above. (260&ndash;261, my emphasis)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
Since G&ouml;del later refers to such axioms as having
&ldquo;intrinsic necessity&rdquo; we shall accordingly speak of such
axioms being <em>intrinsically justified on the basis of the iterative
concept of set</em>. </p>

<p>
 The notion of <em>extrinsic justification</em> is introduced as
follows: </p>

<blockquote> <p>
[E]ven disregarding the intrinsic necessity of some
new axiom, and even in case it has no intrinsic necessity at all, a
probable decision about its truth is possible also in another way,
namely, inductively by studying its &ldquo;success&rdquo;. (261)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
Here by &ldquo;success&rdquo; G&ouml;del means &ldquo;fruitfulness
in consequences, in particular &ldquo;verifiable&rdquo;
consequences&rdquo;. In a famous passage he writes: </p>

<blockquote> <p>
There might exist axioms so abundant in their
verifiable consequences, shedding so much light upon a whole field,
and yielding such powerful methods for solving problems (and even
solving them constructively, as far as that is possible) that, no
matter whether or not they are intrinsically necessary, they would
have to be accepted at least in the same sense as any well-established
physical theory. (261)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
 Let us now consider some examples. Consider first the conception
of natural number that underlies the theory of Peano Arithmetic
(PA). This conception of natural number not only justifies
mathematical induction for the language of PA but also for any
mathematical extension of the language of PA that is
 meaningful.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#7" name="note-7">7</a>]</sup> 
 For
example, if we extend the language of PA by adding the Tarski truth
predicate and we extend the axioms of PA by adding the Tarski truth
axioms, then, on the basis of the conception of natural number, we are
justified in accepting instances of mathematical induction involving
the truth predicate. In the resulting theory, one can prove
Con(PA). This process can then be iterated (for more on this subject
see Feferman (1991) and the references therein) In contrast,
the <span class="nw">&Pi;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-statement
Con(ZFC + &ldquo;There are &omega;-many Woodin cardinals&rdquo;) (a
statement to which we shall return below) is undoubtedly <em>not</em>
intrinsically justified on the basis of the conception of natural
number; rather its justification flows from an intricate network of
theorems in contemporary set theory, as we shall argue below. </p>

<p>
 Consider next the iterative conception of set. As in the case of
arithmetic, this conception (arguably) intrinsically justifies
instances of Replacement and Comprehension for certain extensions of
the language of set theory. But there are richer principles that are
(arguably) intrinsically justified on the basis of this conception,
namely, the set-theoretic reflection principles. These principles
assert (roughly) that any property that holds of <i>V</i> holds of
some initial segment <i>V</i><sub>&alpha;</sub>. These principles
yield inaccessible and Mahlo cardinals (and more) and quite likely
underlie G&ouml;del's claims in the above passage. Some have argued
that such reflection principles are intrinsically justified on the
basis of the iterative conception of set and, moreover, that they
exhaust the principles that can be intrinsically justified on that
conception (see, for example, Tait (2001), reprinted in (2005b),
pp. 283&ndash;284). </p>

<p>
 There is a view according to which intrinsically justified axioms
are minimal points in the evidentness order and, moreover, that that
is the most that one can hope for. On such a view, if one grants that
the above principles of set theory are intrinsically justified on the
basis of the iterative conception of set, then although one would have
axioms that far surpassed the reaches of predicativism and even ZFC,
limitations would still remain and presumably a proponent of such a
view would embrace pluralism for the remainder. For example, if, as
Tait (2001) argues, intrinsic justifications are confined to the
hierarchy of reflection principles investigated in Tait (2005a), then
by the results of Koellner (2009a), such a view would have to embrace
pluralism with regard to PU. </p>

<p>
 Extrinsic justifications provide us with the hope of securing
axioms that have much greater reach. For they provide us with an
additional way to secure axioms, one that proves to be very rich. On
this view one can hope for much more than a minimal point in the
evidentness order&mdash;one can hope to garner evidence for a
proposition examining its inter-relationships with other statements
that are low in the evidentness ordering. Let us describe in very
broad brush strokes how this might work. To begin with, let us say
that a statement is &ldquo;intrinsically plausible&rdquo; if it is
&ldquo;low&rdquo; in the evidentness order but the sort of thing that
could be overturned by other 
 evidence.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#8" name="note-8">8</a>]</sup> 
 One way to garner support for a proposition
is to show that it leads to intrinsically plausible consequences. If
one then shows that it is the <em>only</em> statement that has these
intrinsically plausible consequences then that strengthens the case by
ruling out possible incompatible competitors. If one shows that there
are other intrinsically plausible statements that actually imply the
axiom in question then that again strengthens the case by mapping over
the degree of intrinsic plausibility attached to one statement over to
another. </p>

<p>
 On this picture the general structure of the case for new axioms
is this: First, for each interpretability degree one isolates the
minimal points in the evidentness order and one organizes the entire
degree under the degree of one statement being more evident than
another. As one climbs the interpretability degrees the minimal points
generally become less evident and so one seeks additional
support. Second, one then examines the interconnections among the
statements in the interpretability degree, in particular, among the
statements which are low in the evidentness order. The hope is that a
series of deep mathematical theorems will reveal structural
connections that provides more and more evidential support for the
statements. Should this be the case then the loss in evidence attached
to the minimal points as one climbs the interpretability hierarchy
would be compensated for by the gain in structural connections that
are revealed as one ascends to richer domains of mathematics. </p>

<p>
 All of this is rather abstract at this stage. It is now time to
turn to a concrete mathematical case where such structural connections
have been found. The question, of course, will be whether the
mathematics makes for a convincing extrinsic case for new axioms. And
the question of pluralism at this level&mdash;where we are
presupposing ZFC and trying to solve the problem of selection for
second-order arithmetic&mdash;will rest on the nature of the
case. </p>

<h2><a name="ClaDesSetThe">2.  Classical Descriptive Set Theory</a></h2>

<p>
Descriptive set theory is the study of the structural properties of
definable sets of real numbers. In this section we shall (1) provide a
brief historical overview, (2) introduce the basic notions of
descriptive set theory (explaining what we mean by &ldquo;definable
sets&rdquo; and &ldquo;structural properties&rdquo;), (3) describe the
central classical results, and (4) discuss the limitative results that
ultimately explained why the classical descriptive set theorists had
run into difficulties when attempting to generalize their
results. </p>

 

<h3><a name="HisOve">2.1  Historical Overview</a></h3>

<p>
One reason for concentrating on definable sets of reals is that it
is generally easier to gain insight into definable sets of reals than
arbitrary sets of reals and, furthermore, there is hope that this
insight will shed light on the latter. For example, in one of the
earliest results in the subject, Cantor and Bendixson showed that
every closed set is either countable or has the size of the continuum;
in other words, the closed sets satisfy CH. </p>

<p>
 The main origins of the subject lie in the early 20<sup>th</sup>
century in the work of the French analysts Borel, Baire, and
Lebesgue. The subject grew into an independent discipline through the
work of the Russian mathematician Luzin (who had learned of the
subject as a student while in Paris) and was developed by his
students, most notably Suslin. The end of this early period of
descriptive set theory was marked by a major theorem proved by the
Japanese mathematician Kond&ocirc; in 1937. After nearly 40 years of
development, progress came to an abrupt halt. The explanation for this
was eventually provided by the independence results of G&ouml;del and
Cohen (in 1938 and 1963). For, using this machinery, it was shown that
the open questions that the early descriptive set theorists were
trying to answer could not be resolved on the basis of the standard
axioms of mathematics, ZFC. It is a testament to the ingenuity of the
early descriptive set theorists that they had developed their subject
right up to the edge of undecidability. </p>

<p>
 The independence results of G&ouml;del and Cohen thus showed that
if one wished to develop descriptive set theory further then one must
invoke additional axioms. There were two main approaches, each of
which led to a rebirth of descriptive set theory. The first approach
was to invoke <em>axioms of definable determinacy</em>. The axiom of
determinacy (AD) was introduced by Mycielski and Steinhaus in 1962 and
it was quickly seen to yield generalizations of the results of
classical descriptive theory. Unfortunately, AD contradicts AC and for
this reason it was never really proposed as a new axiom. However,
Solovay and Takeuti pointed out that there is a natural such
subuniverse, namely, <i>L</i>(&#8477;), in which AD could hold,
consistently with assuming AC in the full universe. This led to a
hierarchy of <em>axioms of definable determinacy</em> that underwent
intensive investigation in the 1970s and 1980s. The main sources for
this period are Moschovakis (1980) and the volumes of the Cabal
seminar during 1977&ndash;1985. The second approach was to
invoke <em>large cardinal axioms</em>. This approach was initiated by
Solovay in 1965. Finally, in the late 1960s Solovay conjectured that
large cardinal axioms actually imply axioms of definable
determinacy. If true, this would open the way for a unification of the
two approaches. This hope was realized in the work of Martin, Steel,
and Woodin from 1984 onward. </p>

<h3><a name="BasNot">2.2  Basic Notions</a></h3>

 

<h4>2.2.1  Hierarchies of Definability</h4>

<p>
In descriptive set theory it is convenient to work with the
&ldquo;logician's reals&rdquo;, that is, Baire space:
&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>. This is the set of all infinite sequences
of natural numbers (with the product topology (taking &omega; as
 discrete)).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#9" name="note-9">9</a>]</sup> 
 In
what follows, when we write &lsquo;&#8477;&rsquo; we shall always mean
&lsquo;&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>&rsquo;. </p>

<p>
 We are interested in sets of reals that are
&ldquo;definable&rdquo; or &ldquo;built up from below by simple
operations.&rdquo; We shall discuss three central regions of the
hierarchy of definability&mdash;the <em>Borel</em> sets of reals,
the <em>projective</em> sets of reals, and the sets of reals
in <i>L</i>(&#8477;). </p>

<p>
 The <em>Borel</em> sets of reals (or sets of <i>k</i>-tuples of
reals) are obtained by starting with the closed subsets of
&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup> (or
(&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i></sup> for some k &lt;
&omega;) and closing under the operations of countable union and
countable intersection. This can be described level by level as
follows: Let <i>k</i> &lt; &omega;. At the base level,
let <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
consist of the open subsets of
(&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i></sup> and
let <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
consist of the closed subsets of
(&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i></sup>. For each ordinal
&alpha; such that 0 &lt; &alpha; &lt; &omega;<sub>1</sub>, recursively
define <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">&alpha;</span></span></span>
to consist of the sets that are countable unions of sets appearing in
some <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">&beta;</span></span></span>,
for &beta; &lt; &alpha;, and
define <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">&alpha;</span></span></span>
to consist of the sets that are countable intersections of sets
appearing in
some <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">&beta;</span></span></span>,
for &beta; &lt; &alpha;. The Borel sets of (<i>k</i>-tuples of) reals
are the sets appearing in this 
 hierarchy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#10" name="note-10">10</a>]</sup> 
 In 1905 Lebesgue employed Cantor's notion
of a universal set and technique of diagonalization to show that the
hierarchy of Borel sets is a <em>proper</em> hierarchy (that is, new
sets appear at each level). </p>

<p>
 The <em>projective</em> sets of reals (or sets of <i>k</i>-tuples
of reals) are obtained by starting with the closed subsets of
(&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i></sup> and iterating the
operations of complementation and projection. For <i>A</i> &sube;
(&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i></sup>,
the <em>complement</em> of <i>A</i> is simply
(&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i></sup>
&minus; <i>A</i>. For <i>A</i> &sube;
(&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i>+1</sup>,
the <em>projection</em> of <i>A</i> is </p>

<blockquote><i>p</i>[<i>A</i>] = {&lang;<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;, <i>x</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>&rang; &isin; (&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i></sup> | &exist;<i>y</i> &lang;<i>x</i><sub>1</sub>,&hellip;, <i>x</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>, <i>y</i>&rang; &isin; <i>A</i>}.</blockquote>

<p>
 (Think of the case where <i>k</i> + 1 = 3. Here <i>A</i> is a
subset of three-dimensional space and <i>p</i>[<i>A</i>] is the result
of &ldquo;projecting&rdquo; <i>A</i> along the third axis onto the
plane spanned by the first two axes.)  We can now define the hierarchy
of projective sets as follows: At the base level,
let <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">0</span></span></span>
consist of the open subsets of
(&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i></sup> and
let <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">0</span></span></span>
consist of the closed subsets of
(&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i></sup>. For each <i>n</i> such
that 0 &lt; n &lt; &omega;, recursively
define <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>
to consist of the complements of sets
in <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>,
and
define <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i>+1</span></span></span>
to consist of the projections of sets
in <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>. The
projective sets of (<i>k</i>-tuples of) reals are the sets appearing
in this hierarchy. This hierarchy is also a proper hierarchy, as can
be seen using universal sets and diagonalization. </p>

<p>
 It is useful to also introduce
the <span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>
sets. A set of (<i>k</i>-tuples of) reals
is <span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>
iff it is
both <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>
and <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>. In
1917, Suslin showed that the Borel sets are precisely
the <span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
sets. Thus, the projective hierarchy extends the Borel hierarchy. </p>

<p>
 It might seem odd to refer to the above hierarchies as hierarchies
of definability. However, as the notation indicates, the above
hierarchies can be recast in terms of definability. For example, the
projective sets are exactly the sets which are definable (with
parameters) in second-order arithmetic. In the
notation <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>,
the superscript indicates that we are allowing quantification over
objects of second-order (that is, sets of integers (or, equivalently,
real numbers)), &lsquo;&Sigma;&rsquo; indicates that the starting
quantifier is existential, the subscript indicates that there
are <i>n</i>-alternations of quantifiers, and &lsquo;&sim;&rsquo;
indicates that we are allowing real parameters. In the case where real
parameters are prohibited, the corresponding pointclasses are
denoted <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>, <span class="nw">&Pi;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>,
and <span class="nw">&Delta;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>. The
former hierarchy (where real parameters are allowed) is called
a <em>boldface</em> hierarchy, while the latter (where real parameters
are prohibited) is called a <em>lightface</em> hierarchy. In a similar
manner one can define a lightface version of the Borel
 hierarchy.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#11" name="note-11">11</a>]</sup>
 Thus, we really have two hierarchies of definability: the lightface
hierarchy and the boldface hierarchy. </p>

<p>
 The projective hierarchy can be extended into the transfinite as
follows: For a set <i>X</i>, let Def(<i>X</i>) consist of the subsets
of <i>X</i> that are definable over <i>X</i> using parameters
from <i>X</i>. This is the <em>definable powerset</em> operation. The
hierarchy <i>L</i>(&#8477;) is the result of starting with &#8477; and
iterating the definable powerset operation along the ordinals; more
precisely, we let <i>L</i><sub>0</sub>(&#8477;)
= <i>V</i><sub>&omega;+1</sub>, <i>L</i><sub>&alpha;+1</sub>(&#8477;)
=
Def(<i>L</i><sub>&alpha;</sub>(&#8477;)), <i>L</i><sub>&lambda;</sub>(&#8477;)
=
&#8899;<sub>&alpha;&lt;&lambda;</sub><i>L</i><sub>&alpha;</sub>(&#8477;)
for limit ordinals &lambda;, and, finally, </p>

<blockquote><i>L</i>(&#8477;) = &#8899;<sub>&alpha;&isin;On</sub> <i>L</i><sub>&alpha;</sub>(&#8477;).</blockquote>

<p>
 We are interested in the sets of (<i>k</i>-tuples of) reals
appearing in this hierarchy, that
is, <span class="scriptuc">P</span>((&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i></sup>)
&cap; <i>L</i><sub>&alpha;</sub>(&#8477;) for &alpha; &isin;
On. Notice that in the definition of the projective sets,
complementation corresponds to negation and projection corresponds to
existential quantification over real numbers. It follows that the
projective sets of (<i>k</i>-tuples of) reals are
exactly <span class="scriptuc">P</span>((&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i></sup>)
&cap; <i>L</i><sub>1</sub>(&#8477;). Thus, the hierarchy of
sets <span class="scriptuc">P</span>((&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup><i>k</i></sup>)
&cap; <i>L</i><sub>&alpha;</sub>(&#8477;) (for &alpha; &isin; On) does
indeed yield a transfinite extension of the projective sets. </p>

<p>
 One can pass beyond the above hierarchy of sets of reals by
considering richer notions of definability. We shall say little about
these stages, except to note that there are natural limits to the
lightface and boldface hierarchy, namely that of being definable from
ordinal parameters (OD) and that of being definable from ordinal
parameters and real numbers (OD(&#8477;)). To see that the notion
of <em>ordinal definability</em> is a limiting case of the lightface
hierarchy notice first that any notion of definability which does not
render all of the ordinals definable can be transcended (as can be
seen by considering the least ordinal which is not definable according
to the notion) and second that the notion of ordinal definability
cannot be so transcended (since by reflection OD is ordinal
definable). (Similar considerations apply to the boldface hierarchy.)
It is for this reason that G&ouml;del proposed the notion of ordinal
definability as a candidate for an &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; notion of
definability. As a limiting case of the lightface and boldface
hierarchy we therefore have the sets of reals that are OD and the sets
of reals that are OD(&#8477;), respectively. </p>

 

<h4>2.2.2  Regularity Properties</h4>

<p>
There are many properties shared by &ldquo;well-behaved&rdquo; sets
of reals. These are called <em>regularity properties</em>. We shall
concentrate on the three most central regularity
properties&mdash;the <em>perfect set property</em>, the <em>property
of Baire</em>, and <em>Lebesgue measurability</em>. </p>

<p>
 A set of reals is <em>perfect</em> iff it is nonempty, closed and
contains no isolated points. The key feature of this for our purposes
is that if a set of reals contains a perfect subset then it must have
the same size as the continuum (i.e., the reals). A set of reals is
said to have the <em>perfect set property</em> iff it is either
countable or contains a perfect subset. The interest of this property
is that the sets of reals with the perfect set property satisfy CH. In
early work, Cantor and Bendixson established (in 1883) that all closed
sets have the perfect set property. Thus, there is no closed
counter-example to the continuum hypothesis. Later, in 1903, Young
showed that
the <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>
sets have the perfect set property. A central question was how far
this property propagates. Do all of the Borel sets of reals have the
perfect set property? Do all of the projective sets of reals have the
perfect set property? </p>

<p>
 A set of reals is <em>nowhere dense</em> iff its closure under
limits contains no open sets. A set of reals is <em>meager</em> iff it
is the countable union of nowhere dense sets. Finally, a set of
reals <i>A</i> has the <em>property of Baire</em> iff it is
&ldquo;almost open&rdquo; in the sense that there is an open
set <i>O</i> such that the region where <i>O</i> and <i>A</i> do not
overlap (that is, the symmetric difference (<i>O</i> &minus; <i>A</i>)
&cup; (<i>A</i> &minus; <i>O</i>)) is meager. It is straightforward to
show that all Borel sets have the property of Baire. Do all of the
projective sets have the property of Baire? </p>

<p>
 The property of <em>Lebesgue measurability</em> is familiar from
analysis and here we shall be more brief. To begin with, one
introduces a probability measure over sets of reals. A set of reals
is <em>null</em> iff it has measure zero. A set of reals <i>A</i>
is <em>Lebesgue measurable</em> iff it is &ldquo;almost Borel&rdquo;
in the sense that there is a Borel set <i>B</i> such that the region
where <i>B</i> and <i>A</i> do not overlap is null. The interest of
this notion can perhaps be best brought out by recalling a theorem of
Banach and Tarski. Banach and Tarski showed that it is possible to cut
the unit sphere into finitely many pieces, and shift those pieces
around (using only translations and rotations) to bring them back
together into a sphere of twice the size. This requires a key
application of the Axiom of Choice. It is immediate that such pieces
cannot be Lebesgue measurable. The question is &ldquo;How complex must
such pieces be?&rdquo; and this amounts to the question &ldquo;Which
sets are Lebesgue measurable?&rdquo; It is clear that the Borel sets
are Lebesgue measurable. Are the projective sets Lebesgue
measurable? </p>

<p>
 In all three cases it is straightforward to use the Axiom of
Choice to show that there are sets of reals without the regularity
property. The question is whether all <em>definable</em> sets of reals
have these properties. </p>

 

<h4>2.2.3  Structural Properties</h4>

<p>
There are many structural properties connected with sets of
reals&mdash;the uniformization property, the separation property, the
prewellordering property, the basis property, the existence of scales,
Suslin cardinals, the existence of homogeneous representations,
etc. We shall concentrate on just one such property&mdash;the
uniformization property. </p>

<p>
 Let <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> be subsets of the plane
(&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>)<sup>2</sup>. <i>A</i> <em>uniformizes</em> <i>B</i>
iff <i>A</i> &sube; <i>B</i> and for all <i>x</i> &isin;
&omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>, there exists <i>y</i> such that
&lang;<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>&rang; &isin; <i>B</i> iff there is
a <em>unique</em> <i>y</i> such that &lang;<i>x</i>,<i>y</i>&rang;
&isin; <i>A</i>. In other words, <i>A</i> yields a choice function
for <i>B</i>. Using AC it is clear that every set <i>B</i> has a
uniformizing set <i>A</i>. However, the question of whether
uniformizations exist becomes interesting when one imposes a
definability constraint. Let &Gamma; be a collection of
(<i>k</i>-tuples of) sets of reals. Such a class is called
a <em>pointclass</em>. The pointclass &Gamma; has <em>uniformization
property</em> (Unif(&Gamma;)) iff every subset of the plane that is in
&Gamma; admits a uniformization that is also in &Gamma;. </p>

 

<h3><a name="ClaRes">2.3  Classical Results</a></h3>

<p>
During the early 20<sup>th</sup> century there were many advances
by the French and Russian analysts in establishing that definable sets
had the above regularity and structural properties. We shall limit our
discussion to the crowning achievements: </p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Theorem 2.1</strong> (Luzin, Suslin 1917).</dt><dd><em>Assume</em> ZFC. <em>The</em> <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span> <em>sets have the perfect set property, the property of Baire, and are Lebesgue measurable.</em>  </dd></dl>

<p>
 Notice that the property of Baire and Lebesgue measurability have
the feature that if they hold of <i>A</i> then they hold of the
complement of <i>A</i>. However, the perfect set property does not
have this feature. It remained open whether
all <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
sets have the perfect set property and whether
all <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>
sets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable. </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 2.2</strong> (Kond&ocirc; 1937).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC. <em>Then</em> Unif(<span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>) <em>holds.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
 It remained open whether all sets of reals
in <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>, <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">3</span></span></span>,
etc. have the uniformization property. </p>

 

<h3><a name="LimRes">2.4  Limitative Results</a></h3>

<p>
It proved difficult to extend the above results to higher
pointclasses, so much so that in 1925 Luzin said that &ldquo;<em>one
will never know</em>&rdquo; whether all of the projective sets of
reals have the regularity properties. </p>

<p>
 We now know the reason for the difficulties&mdash;the early
analysts were working in ZFC and the above questions cannot be
resolved on the basis of ZFC alone. It is a testament to the power of
the early analysts that they obtained the strongest results that were
within the reach of their background assumptions. </p>

<p>
 The independence of the above statements follows from the dual
techniques of <em>inner model theory</em> (invented by G&ouml;del in
1938) and <em>outer model theory</em> (invented by Cohen in
1963). </p>

<p>
 The first half was established by G&ouml;del and Addison: </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 2.3</strong> (G&ouml;del).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC + <i>V</i> = <i>L</i>. <em>Then there are</em> <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span> <em>sets that do not have the property of Baire and are not Lebesgue measurable and there are</em> <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span> <em>sets that do not have the perfect set property.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 2.4</strong> (Addison 1959).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC + <i>V</i> = <i>L</i>. <em>Then for all</em> <i>n</i> &ge; 2,  Unif(<span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>).  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
It follows that (assuming that ZFC is consistent), ZFC cannot prove
that <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>
sets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable,
that <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
sets have the perfect set property, and that
Unif(<span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i></span></span></span>)
fails for <i>n</i> &ge; 2. It remained open whether ZFC could
establish the negations. </p>

<p>
 The second half was established by Martin, Solovay and Levy: </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 2.5</strong> (Solovay 1965).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em>  ZFC <em>and that there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal. Then there is a forcing extension in which all projective sets have the perfect set property, the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
The strongly inaccessible cardinal is necessary for the perfect set
property (even
for <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
sets (Solovay)) and Lebesgue measurability (Shelah) but not for the
property of Baire (Shelah). However, Martin and Solovay showed in 1970
that if ZFC is consistent then so is ZFC along with the statement that
all <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>
sets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable. </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 2.6</strong> (Levy 1965).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC. <em>Then there is a forcing extension in which</em> Unif(<span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>) <em>fails.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
In fact, Levy noted that this is the case in the original model
introduced by Cohen. </p>

<p>
 Putting everything together we have the following: (1) If ZFC is
consistent, then ZFC cannot determine whether
all <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>
sets have the property of Baire and are Lebesgue measurable. (2) If
ZFC + &ldquo;There is a strongly inaccessible cardinal&rdquo; is
consistent, then ZFC cannot determine whether
all <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
sets have the perfect set property. (3) If ZFC is consistent, then ZFC
cannot determine the pattern of the uniformization property; more
precisely, it is consistent with ZFC that the uniformization property
has either the pattern </p>

<h2><a name="DetLarCar">3.  Determinacy and Large Cardinals</a></h2>

<p>
The above limitative results show that ZFC lacks sufficient power
to resolve many questions about simple definable sets of
reals&mdash;it cannot determine
whether <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>
sets have the regularity properties and it cannot determine the
pattern of the uniformization property
beyond <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>. This
placed mathematicians in an interesting predicament. In order to
resolve these questions they must expand their resources beyond
ZFC. But there are many ways of doing this and it is unclear at the
outset whether there is a correct direction of expansion. </p>

<p>
 There were two main candidates for new axioms that underwent
intensive investigation in the 1970s and 1980s: Axioms of definable
determinacy and large cardinal axioms. In this section we will (1)
introduce the basic machinery of determinacy and describe the
implications of axioms of definable determinacy for classical
descriptive set theory and (2) describe the implications of large
cardinal axioms for classical descriptive set theory and briefly touch
on the connection between the two approaches. </p>

 

<h3><a name="Det">3.1  Determinacy</a></h3>

<p>
For a set of reals <i>A</i> &sube; &omega;<sup>&omega;</sup>
consider the game where two players take turns playing natural
numbers: </p>

<table>
<tr><td style="width:3em">I</td> <td> <i>x</i>(0)</td> <td></td> <td> <i>x</i>(2)</td> <td></td><td> <i>x</i>(4)</td><td></td> <td>&hellip;</td></tr>
<tr><td style="width:3em">II</td> <td></td> <td> <i>x</i>(1)</td><td></td> <td> <i>x</i>(3)</td><td></td> <td>&hellip;</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
 At the end of a round of this game the two players will have
produced a real <i>x</i>, obtained through &ldquo;interleaving&rdquo;
their plays. We say that Player I wins the round if <i>x</i>
&isin; <i>A</i>; otherwise Player II wins the round. The set <i>A</i>
is said to be <em>determined</em> if one of the players has a
&ldquo;winning strategy&rdquo; in the associated game, that is, a
strategy which ensures that the player wins a round regardless of how
the other player plays. The <em>Axiom of Determinacy</em> (AD) is the
statement that <em>every</em> set of reals is determined. This axiom
was introduced by Mycielski and Steinhaus in 1962. </p>

<p>
 It is straightforward to see that very simple sets are
determined. For example, if <i>A</i> is the set of all reals then
clearly I has a winning strategy; if <i>A</i> is empty then clearly II
has a winning strategy; and if <i>A</i> is countable then II has a
winning strategy (by &ldquo;diagonalizing&rdquo;). This might lead one
to expect that <em>all</em> sets of reals are determined. However, it
is straightforward to use the Axiom of Choice (AC) to construct a
non-determined set (by listing all winning strategies and
&ldquo;diagonalizing&rdquo; across them). For this reason AD was never
really considered as a serious candidate for a new axiom. However,
there is an interesting class of related axioms that are consistent
with AC, namely, the axioms of <em>definable determinacy</em>. These
axioms extend the above pattern by asserting that all sets of reals at
a given level of complexity are determined, notable examples
being <span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-determinacy
(all Borel sets of reals are determined), PD (all projective sets of
reals are determined) and AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> (all sets of
reals in <i>L</i>(&#8477;) are determined). </p>

<p>
 One issue is whether these are really new axioms or whether they
follow from ZFC. One of the earliest results in the subject (due to
Gale and Stewart in 1953) is that (in ZFC)
all <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">0<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
(that is, closed) games are determined. This result was extended to
the next few levels of the Borel hierarchy. Finally, in 1974, Martin
proved the landmark result
that <span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-determinacy
is provable in ZFC. It turns out that this result is close to
optimal&mdash;as one climbs the hierarchy of definability, shortly
after <span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
one arrives at axioms that fall outside the provenance of ZFC. For
example, this is true
of <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-determinacy,
PD and AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. Thus, we have here a hierarchy
of axioms (including PD and AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>) which are
genuine candidates for new axioms. </p>

<p>
 For a pointclass &Gamma; of (<i>k</i>-tuples of) sets of reals,
let Det(&Gamma;) be the statement that all sets of reals in &Gamma;
are determined. In what follows we shall assume that &Gamma; has
certain minimal closure properties; more precisely, we shall assume
that &Gamma; is an <em>adequate</em> pointclass in the sense of
Moschovakis (1980). The precise details of this notion are not
important for our purposes; suffice it to say that all of the
pointclasses introduced thus far are adequate. </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.1</strong> (Banach, Mazur, Oxtoby 1957).</dt><dd>   <em>Assume</em> ZFC + Det(&Gamma;). <em>Then the sets of reals in</em> &Gamma; <em>have the property of Baire.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.2</strong> (Mycielski-Swierczkowski 1964).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC + Det(&Gamma;). <em>Then the sets of reals in</em> &Gamma; <em>are Lebesgue measurable.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.3</strong> (Davis 1964).</dt><dd>   <em>Assume</em> ZFC + Det(&Gamma;). <em>Then the sets in</em> &Gamma; <em>have the perfect set property.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
 In particular, if one assumes PD then all projective sets of reals
have the regularity properties and if one assumes
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> then all of the sets of reals
in <i>L</i>(&#8477;) have the regularity properties. </p>

<p>
 In fact by modifying the above proofs one can obtain the
regularity properties for a larger pointclass, namely,
&exist;<sup>&#8477;</sup>&Gamma;. This is the pointclass obtained by
taking projections of sets in &Gamma;. So, for example, if &Gamma;
is <span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
then &exist;<sup>&#8477;</sup>&Gamma;
is <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>. It
follows that
assuming <span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-determinacy
(which is provable in ZFC) one gets that
the <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
sets of reals have the regularity properties (see the exercises in 6.G
of Moschovakis (1980)). In this sense determinacy lies at the heart of
the regularity properties and may be considered their true
source. </p>

<p>
 The above results show that axioms of definable determinacy extend
the results on regularity properties that can be proved in ZFC. ZFC
can establish that
all <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
sets of reals have the regularity properties
and <span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-determinacy
(a theorem of ZFC) lies at the heart of this result. The extension
of <span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-determinacy
to stronger forms of definable determinacy (PD,
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>, etc.) generalizes these results by
extending the regularity properties to the corresponding pointclasses
(projective, in <i>L</i>(&#8477;), etc.) </p>

<p>
 In a similar fashion, axioms of definable determinacy extend the
results on the uniformization property. </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.4</strong> (Moschovakis 1971).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC + Det(<span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2<i>n</i></span></span></span>). <em>Then</em> Unif(<span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2<i>n</i>+1</span></span></span>) <em>and</em> Unif(<span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2<i>n</i>+2</span></span></span>).  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Thus, under PD the uniformization property has the following
pattern: </p>

<!--

<p>
 This pattern recurs at higher levels under stronger forms of
determinacy. For example, under AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> the
pattern recurs throughout the transfinite extension of the projective
sets within <i>L</i>(&#8477;). For all of <i>L</i>(&#8477;) one
has: </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.5</strong> (Martin-Steel 1983).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC +AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. <em>Then in</em> <i>L</i>(&#8477;),  <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">2<span class="lower">1</span></span></span> <em>has the uniformization property.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
(Here <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">2<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
is defined just as (the logical version)
of <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
except that now the initial quantifier ranges over sets of reals and
not just reals (as is indicated by the superscript).)  </p>

<p>
 Moreover, the uniformization property is not an isolated case. The
same pattern holds for other properties, such as the prewellordering
property and the scale property. </p>

<h3><a name="LarCarA">3.2  Large Cardinals</a></h3>

<p>
The second approach to new axioms&mdash;which ran in parallel to
the approach using definable determinacy&mdash;was to invoke large
cardinal axioms. In fact, it was gradually shown (as Solovay had
conjectured in the late 1960s) that large cardinal axioms actually
imply forms of definable determinacy. </p>

<p>
 The result that underscored the significance of large cardinal
axioms for the structure theory of simply definable sets of reals is
the following early result of Solovay: </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.6</strong> (Solovay 1965).</dt><dd>   <em>Assume</em>  ZFC <em>and that there is a measurable cardinal. Then all</em>  <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span> <em>sets of reals have the perfect set property, the property of Baire, and are Lebesgue measurable.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
 Given
that <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-determinacy
implies the regularity properties
for <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>
sets of reals (see the discussion after Theorems 3.1&ndash;3.3), it
was reasonable to suspect that a measurable cardinal actually
implied <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-determinacy. This
was established by Martin: </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.7</strong> (Martin 1970).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC <em>and that there is a measurable cardinal. Then</em> <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span><em>-determinacy holds.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
 Since definable determinacy lay at the heart of the structure
theory, much of the energy was focused on trying to show that it
followed from large cardinal axioms. The next major advance was made
in 1978. </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.8</strong> (Martin 1978).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC <em>and that there is a non-trivial elementary embedding</em> j : <i>V</i><sub>&lambda;+1</sub> &rarr; <i>V</i><sub>&lambda;+1</sub>. <em>Then</em> <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span><em>-determinacy holds.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
(Martin actually used a somewhat weaker assumption but it is
somewhat technical and it would not be illuminating to state it
here.) </p>

<p>
 In early 1979, Woodin extended this by showing that PD follows
from much stronger large cardinal hypotheses. To describe this, let us
introduce some terminology: Suppose <i>j</i>
: <i>V</i><sub>&lambda;+1</sub> &rarr; <i>V</i><sub>&lambda;+1</sub>
is a non-trivial elementary embedding. Let
&kappa;<sub>0</sub>(<i>j</i>) be the critical point of <i>j</i> and
for each <i>n</i> let &kappa;<sub><i>n</i>+1</sub>(<i>j</i>)
= <i>j</i>(&kappa;<sub><i>n</i></sub>(<i>j</i>)). Let
&kappa;<sub><i>w</i></sub>(<i>j</i>)
={sup}<sub>n&lt;&omega;</sub>&kappa;<sub><i>n</i></sub>(<i>j</i>). (Notice
that <i>j</i>(&kappa;<sub>&omega;</sub>(<i>j</i>)) =
&kappa;<sub>&omega;</sub>(<i>j</i>).)  A sequence of
embeddings <i>j</i><sub>0</sub>,&hellip;, <i>j</i><sub><i>n</i></sub>
is an <i>n</i><em>-fold strong rank to rank embedding sequence</em> if
there exists a &lambda; such that </p>

<ol> <li>for each <i>i</i> &le; <i>n</i>, <blockquote><i>j</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> : <i>V</i><sub>&lambda;+1</sub> &rarr; <i>V</i><sub>&lambda;+1</sub></blockquote>

<p>
 is a non-trivial elementary embedding and </p>

</li>
<li>for each <i>i</i> &lt; <i>n</i>, <blockquote>&kappa;<sub>&omega;</sub>(<i>j</i><sub><i>i</i></sub>) &lt; &kappa;<sub>&omega;</sub>(<i>j</i><sub><i>i</i>+1</sub>).</blockquote>

</li>
</ol>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.9</strong> (Woodin 1979).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZF. <em>For each</em> <i>n</i> &lt; &omega;, <em>if there is an</em> <i>n</i><em>-fold strong rank to rank embedding sequence then</em> <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i>+2</span></span></span><em>-determinacy holds.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
So PD follows from the assumption that for each <i>n</i>, there is
an <i>n</i>-fold strong rank to rank embedding sequence. </p>

<p>
 The interesting thing about these large cardinal hypotheses is
that for <i>n</i> &gt; 0 they are inconsistent with AC (by a result of
Kunen). Moreover, there is now reason to believe that for <i>n</i>
&gt; 0 they are outright inconsistent (in ZF) (see Woodin
(2011)). Should this turn out to be the case it would be rather
interesting since it would be a case where one derived structure
theory from an inconsistency without awareness of the
inconsistency. </p>

<p>
 Fortunately, in December of 1983 Woodin both strengthened the
conclusion and reduced the large cardinal hypothesis to one that is
not known to be inconsistent with AC: </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.10</strong> (Woodin 1984).</dt><dd>   <em>Assume</em> ZFC <em>and that there is a non-trivial elementary embedding</em> <i>j</i> : <i>L</i>(<i>V</i><sub>&lambda;+1</sub>) &rarr; <i>L</i>(<i>V</i><sub>&lambda;+1</sub>) <em>with critical point less than</em> &lambda;. <em>Then</em> AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> <em>holds.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
In fact, Woodin got much more definable determinacy than
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. </p>

<p>
 Still, the large cardinal assumption was thought to be too
strong. At this point the episode of history described
earlier&mdash;the one involving Solovay's theorem of 1965 and Martin's
theorem of 1970&mdash;repeated itself. For in 1984 Woodin showed that
if there is a supercompact cardinal then all projective sets have the
regularity properties. In joint work with Shelah, the hypothesis was
significantly reduced. </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.11</strong> (Shelah-Woodin 1984).</dt><dd>   <em>Assume</em>  ZFC <em>and that there are</em>  <i>n</i> <em>Woodin cardinals with a measurable cardinal above them all. Then the</em>  <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i>+2</span></span></span> <em>have the perfect set property, the property of Baire, and are Lebesgue measurable.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
 As in the earlier episode, this suggested that the above large
cardinal hypothesis actually
implied <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i>+1</span></span></span>-determinacy. This
was soon established by a landmark result of Martin and Steel. </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.12</strong> (Martin-Steel 1985).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC <em>and that there are</em> <i>n</i> <em>Woodin cardinals with a measurable cardinal above them all. Then</em> <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower"><i>n</i>+1</span></span></span><em>-determinacy holds.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Finally, in combination with Woodin's work on the stationary tower,
the following result was established. </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 3.13</strong> (Martin, Steel, and Woodin 1985).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em>  ZFC <em>and that there are</em>  &omega; <em>many Woodin cardinals with a measurable cardinal above them all. Then</em>  AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> <em>holds.</em>  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
 In this way the two approaches to new axioms&mdash;via axioms of
definable determinacy and via large cardinal axioms&mdash;were shown
to be closely related. In fact, in subsequent work it was shown that
the connections are much deeper. But to fully appreciate this we must
first introduce the machinery of inner model theory. </p>

<p>
<em>Further Reading</em>: For more on determinacy see sections
27&ndash;32 of Kanamori (2003) and Moschovakis (1980). For further
details concerning the structure theory provided by determinacy see

<h2><a name="CasForDefDet">4.  The Case for Definable Determinacy</a></h2>

<p>
We are now in a position to discuss aspects of the case that has
been made for axioms of definable determinacy. </p>

 

<h3><a name="BasNotA">4.1  Basic Notions</a></h3>

<p>
Let us stress from the beginning that because of the incompleteness
theorems the case for any new axiom is going to have to be
delicate. The standard way of establishing a proposition in
mathematics is by proving it within some accepted set of
axioms. However, the axioms implicitly accepted by mathematicians in
everyday practice seem to be exhausted by those of ZFC, and we are
here dealing with questions and new axioms that are beyond the reach
of ZFC. Given the nature of the case, it seems unlikely therefore that
one will have a knock-down argument for new axioms. Instead it seems
that the most that one can hope for is to accumulate evidence until
eventually the case becomes compelling. The other alternative is that
the case remains divided between two equally compelling but mutually
inconsistent approaches. </p>

<p>
 Let us first say something very general about how such a case
might proceed. Some propositions have a certain degree
of <em>intrinsic plausibility</em>. For example, the statement that
there is no paradoxical decomposition of the sphere using pieces that
are <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>
is intrinsically plausible, although it is not provable in ZFC. Such
initial support for a proposition is not definitive. For example, the
statement that there are no space filling curves and the statement
that there is no paradoxical decomposition of the sphere using any
pieces whatsoever might have once seemed intrinsically plausible. But
in each case these statements were overturned by theorems proved
against the backdrop of systems that had much more than this degree of
initial plausibility in their favour. However, although such intrinsic
plausibility is not definitive, it nevertheless has some weight. </p>

<p>
 Moreover, the weight can accumulate. Suppose we have two
statements from conceptually distinct domains that are intrinsically
plausible&mdash;for example, one might concern the existence of (inner
models of) large cardinal axioms and the other might concern the
regularity properties of simply definable sets. If it is shown that
the first implies the second then the second inherits the initial
plausibility attached to the first. Should the two statements
ultimately be shown to imply one another this would strengthen the
case for each. The hope is that through the accumulation of
mathematical results&mdash;theorems proved in first-order logic, which
are matters upon which everyone can agree&mdash;various independent
intrinsically plausible statements will come to reinforce each other
to the point where the case as a whole becomes compelling. </p>

<p>
 Some have maintained that this is actually the situation with
axioms of definable determinacy and large cardinal axioms. In the
remainder of this section we shall present the case in the strongest
way we know how. </p>

<p>
<em>Further Reading</em>: For more on the notion of <em>intrinsic
plausibility</em> and how it figures in the structure of reason, see
Chapter 9 of Parsons (2008). </p>

 

<h3><a name="StrThe">4.2  Structure Theory</a></h3>

<p>
For definiteness, when we speak of the &ldquo;structure
theory&rdquo; (at a given level) we shall be referring to the
regularity properties introduced above&mdash;the perfect set property,
and the property of Baire, and Lebesgue measurability&mdash;along with
the uniformization property. There is actually much more (as indicated
above) to the structure theory and what we shall have to say
generalizes. We shall concentrate on two levels of definable
determinacy&mdash;<span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-determinacy
and AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. Again, this is just for
definiteness and what we shall have to say generalizes to certain
higher forms of definable determinacy. </p>

<p>
 The
axiom <span class="nw">&Delta;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-determinacy
(equivalently, Borel-determinacy) is a theorem of ZFC and lies at the
heart of the structure theory of Borel sets (and, in fact,
the <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>-sets
and <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>
sets). One virtue of AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> is that it lifts
this entire structure theory from the Borel sets to the sets
in <i>L</i>(&#8477;). Summarizing results from above we have: </p>

<dl>
<dt>
 <strong>Theorem 4.1.</strong></dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC +AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. <em>Then every set of reals in</em> <i>L</i>(&#8477;) <em>has the perfect set property, the property of Baire, is Lebesgue measurable, and</em>  <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">2<span class="lower">1</span></span></span><em>-uniformization holds in</em> <i>L</i>(&#8477;).  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
 Many descriptive set theorists take these consequences to be
intrinsically plausible. Moreover, they have found the particular
pattern of the uniformization property provided by
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> to be a plausible extension of the
pattern initiated in ZFC. For this last point consider the first
&omega; many levels and compare the case of <i>V</i> = <i>L</i> with
that of PD. In ZFC, the uniformization property propagates
from <span class="nw">&Pi;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
to <span class="nw">&Sigma;&#816;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>. It
is natural to expect it to continue to zig-zag back and
forth. However, under <i>V</i> = <i>L</i> it stabilizes: </p>

<p>
Again, this &ldquo;periodicity phenomenon&rdquo; occurs at higher
levels in <i>L</i>(&#8477;). </p>

<p>
 One might grant that these are indeed fruitful consequences of
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> and as such are evidence that
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> holds. However, one might be concerned
that perhaps there are axioms that share these fruitful consequences
and yet are incompatible with AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. As a
response, one might note that this objection is never raised in the
analogous case of physics where a multitude of incompatible theories
can agree in their empirical consequences. But there is a much
stronger response that one can make. For in contrast to the case of
physics&mdash;where one could never hope to show that there was only
one theory with the desired empirical consequences&mdash;in set theory
this is actually the case; more precisely, any theory that has these
fruitful consequences&mdash;that is, which lifts the structure theory
to the level of <i>L</i>(&#8477;)&mdash;<em>must</em> imply
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. This remarkable fact is embodied in
the following theorem: </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 4.2</strong> (Woodin).</dt><dd>   <em>Assume that all sets in</em> <i>L</i>(&#8477;) <em>are Lebesgue measurable, have the property of Baire, and that</em> <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">2<span class="lower">1</span></span></span><em>-uniformization holds in</em> <i>L</i>(&#8477;). <em>Then</em> AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>.  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
 Summary: There is a &ldquo;good theory&rdquo; (one that lifts the
structure theory) and all good theories imply
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. </p>

<h3><a name="LarCar">4.3  Large Cardinals</a></h3>

<p>
Large cardinal axioms are taken (by those who study them) to have
certain degrees of intrinsic plausibility. As we noted above, large
cardinal axioms imply forms of definable determinacy and so the latter
inherit the considerations in favour of the former. </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 4.3</strong> (Martin, Steel, and Woodin).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC <em>and that there are</em> &omega; <em>many Woodin cardinals with a measurable above them all. Then</em> AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>.  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
 In fact, it turns out that the existence of certain <em>inner
models</em> of large cardinal axioms is sufficient to prove definable
determinacy. Since it is (arguably) even more plausible that there are
such inner models, this (arguably) strengthens the case. So definable
determinacy is a fruitful consequence of the existence of such inner
models. </p>

<p>
 However, just as in the previous subsection, one would like some
assurance that there are not incompatible axioms that share this
fruitful consequence. Remarkably, this turns out to be the
case&mdash;axioms of definable determinacy are
actually <em>equivalent</em> to axioms asserting the existence of
inner models of large cardinals. We discuss what is known about this
connection, starting with a low level of boldface definable
determinacy and proceeding upward. It should be emphasized that our
concern here is not merely with consistency strength but rather with
outright equivalence (over 
 ZFC).<sup>[<a href="notes.html#12" name="note-12">12</a>]</sup> </p>

<p>
 Summary: Large cardinal axioms are sufficient to prove definable
determinacy and inner models of large cardinal axioms are necessary to
prove definable determinacy. In fact, through a series of deep
results, these two conceptually distinct approaches to new axioms are
ultimately seen to be at root equivalent. </p>

 

<h3><a name="GenAbs">4.4  Generic Absoluteness</a></h3>

<p>
Large cardinal axioms have the fruitful consequence that they imply
axioms of definable determinacy and hence illuminate the structure
theory of definable sets of reals. In fact,
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> appears to be &ldquo;effectively
complete&rdquo; with regard to questions
concerning <i>L</i>(&#8477;). Let us try to make this precise in terms
of <em>generic absoluteness</em>. </p>

<p>
 The motivating result in this area is the following: </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 4.9</strong> (Shoenfield).</dt><dd>  <em>Assume</em> ZFC. <em>Suppose</em> &#981; <em>is a</em> <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span> <em>sentence and</em> <i>B</i> <em>is a complete Boolean algebra. Then</em>  
<blockquote><i>V</i> &#8871; &#981; <em>iff</em> <i>V</i><sup><i>B</i></sup> &#8871; &#981;.</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>

 

<p>
In other words,
the <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>-theory
cannot be altered by the method of outer models. In such a situation
we say that &#981; is <em>generically absolute</em>. Since our main
method of establishing independence (without leaving an
interpretability degree) is the method of outer models, this explains
why there are no
known <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">1<span class="lower">2</span></span></span>
statements that lie in the interpretability degree of ZFC and are
known to be independent of ZFC. </p>

<p>
 A fruitful consequence of large cardinal axioms is that they place
us in exactly this situation with regard to a much larger class of
statements (see Larson (2004) for an account of this result). </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 4.10</strong> (Woodin).</dt><dd>   <em>Assume</em>  ZFC <em>and that there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals. Suppose</em>  &#981; <em>is a sentence and</em>  <i>B</i> <em>is a complete Boolean algebra. Then</em>  
<blockquote><i>L</i>(&#8477;)<sup><i>V</i></sup> &#8871; &#981; <em>iff</em> <i>L</i>(&#8477;)<sup><i>V</i><sup><em>B</em></sup></sup> 
&#8871; &#981;.
</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
 In this situation one, of course, has
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. Again, one might be concerned that one
can have this fruitful consequence without having
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. This is addressed by the following
theorem: </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 4.11</strong> (Woodin).</dt><dd>   <em>Assume</em> ZFC <em>and that there is a proper class of strongly inaccessible cardinals. Suppose that the theory of</em> <i>L</i>(&#8477;) <em>is generically absolute. Then</em> AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>.  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
 Summary: There is a &ldquo;good theory&rdquo; (one that freezes
the theory of <i>L</i>(&#8477;)) and (granting a proper class of
strongly inaccessible cardinals) all good theories imply
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. </p>

 

<h3><a name="OveCon">4.5  Overlapping Consensus</a></h3>

<p>
We have discussed two recovery results for
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. First, AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>
is implied by its structural consequences (Theorem 4.2). Second,
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> is recovered by the generic
absoluteness that follows from large cardinals that imply
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> (Theorem 4.11). </p>

<p>
 These recovery results are not isolated occurrences. The technique
used to establish them is known as the <em>core model
induction</em>. This technique has been used to show that many other
strong theories imply AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. This even holds
for theories that are <em>incompatible with one another</em>. For
example, consider the following: </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 4.12.</strong>  (Woodin)</dt><dd> <em>Assume</em> ZFC + there <em>is an</em> &omega;<sub>1</sub><em>-dense ideal on</em> &omega;<sub>1</sub>. <em>Then</em> AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>.  </dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 4.13.</strong>  (Steel)</dt> <dd><em>Assume</em> ZFC + PFA. <em>Then</em> AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>.  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
These two theories are incompatible. There are many other
examples. In fact, the examples are so ubiquitous and the technique is
so general that there is reason to believe that
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> lies in the <em>overlapping
consensus</em> of all sufficiently strong, natural theories. </p>

<p>
 Summary: AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> lies in the overlapping
consensus of numerous strong theories and so it inherits the
considerations of each. Moreover, there is reason to believe that
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> lies in the overlapping consensus
of <em>all</em> sufficiently strong, &ldquo;natural&rdquo;
theories. </p>

 

<h3><a name="BeyL">4.6  Beyond <i>L</i>(&#8477;)</a></h3>

<p>
Much of the above case can be pushed even
beyond <i>L</i>(&#8477;). To explain this we will need to introduce
the notion of a <em>universally Baire</em> set of reals. </p>

<p>
 For a cardinal &delta;, a set <i>A</i> &sube; &#8477; is
&delta;<em>-universally Baire</em> if for all partial orders &#8473;
of cardinality &delta;, there exist trees <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> on
&omega; &times; &lambda; (for some &lambda;) such that <i>A</i>
= <i>p</i>[<i>T</i>] and, if <i>G</i> &sube; &#8473;
is <i>V</i>-generic,
then <i>p</i>[<i>T</i>]<sup><i>V</i>[<i>G</i>]</sup> =
&#8477;<sup><i>V</i>[<i>G</i>]</sup>
&minus; <i>p</i>[<i>S</i>]<sup><i>V</i>[<i>G</i>]</sup>. A
set <i>A</i> &sube; &#8477; is <em>universally Baire</em> if it is
&delta;-universally Baire for all &delta;. The key point is that
universally Baire sets have canonical interpretations in generic
extensions <i>V</i>[<i>G</i>]. Let &Gamma;<sup>&infin;</sup> be the
collection of sets of reals that are universally Baire. This
collection has strong closure properties. For example, Woodin showed
that if there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and A &isin;
&Gamma;<sup>&infin;</sup> then (1) <i>L</i>(<i>A</i>,&#8477;) &#8871;
AD<sup>+</sup> and (2) <span class="scriptuc">P</span>(&#8477;)
&cap; <i>L</i>(<i>A</i>,&#8477;) &sube;
&Gamma;<sup>&infin;</sup>. Here AD<sup>+</sup> is a (potential)
strengthening of AD designed for models of the
form <i>L</i>(<span class="scriptuc">P</span>(&#8477;)) (see Woodin
(1999)). </p>

<p>
 For &kappa; an infinite regular cardinal, let <i>H</i>(&kappa;) be
the set of all sets <i>x</i> such that the cardinality of the
transitive closure of <i>x</i> is less than &kappa;. </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 4.14.</strong>  (Woodin)</dt><dd><em>Suppose there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and</em> <i>A</i> &isin; &Gamma;<sup>&infin;</sup>. <em>Suppose</em> <i>G</i> &sube; &#8473; <em>is</em> <i>V</i><em>-generic. Then</em>  
<blockquote>(<i>H</i>(&omega;<sub>1</sub>),&isin;, <i>A</i>)<sup><i>V</i></sup> &#8826; (<i>H</i>(&omega;<sub>1</sub>)<sup><i>V</i>[<i>G</i>]</sup>,&isin;, <i>A</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>).</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>
That is, we have generic absoluteness for
&ldquo;projective-in-<i>A</i>&rdquo; where <i>A</i> is universally
Baire. In fact, one has
&ldquo;<span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">2<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>(&Gamma;<sup>&infin;</sup>)-generic
absoluteness&rdquo;: </p>

<dl>
<dt>  <strong>Theorem 4.15.</strong>  (Woodin)</dt><dd><em>Suppose there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals and let</em>  &#981; <em>be a sentence of the form</em>  

<blockquote>&exist;<i>A</i> &isin; &Gamma;<sup>&infin;</sup> (<i>H</i>(&omega;<sub>1</sub>), &isin;, <i>A</i>) &#8871; &psi;.</blockquote>
 <em>Suppose</em> <i>G</i> &sube;&#8473; <em>is</em> <i>V</i><em>-generic. Then</em>  
<blockquote><i>V</i> &#8871; &#981; <em>iff</em> <i>V</i>[<i>G</i>] &#8871; &#981;.</blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>

 

<p>
Stronger large cardinal axioms imply that many sets of reals
beyond <i>L</i>(&#8477;) are universally Baire. Let us call a
set <em>absolutely</em> <span class="nw">&Delta;<span class="supsub">2<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
if there
are <span class="nw">&Sigma;<span class="supsub">2<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
formulas which define complementary sets of reals in all generic
extensions. Woodin showed that if there is a proper class of
measurable Woodin cardinals then all
absolutely <span class="nw">&Delta;<span class="supsub">2<span class="lower">1</span></span></span>
sets of reals are universally 
 Baire.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#13" name="note-13">13</a>]</sup> 
 This is one precise sense in which CH was
an unfortunate choice of a test case for the program for large
cardinals&mdash;large cardinal axioms effectively settle all questions
of complexity strictly below (in the above sense) that of
 CH.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#14" name="note-14">14</a>]</sup> </p>

<h3><a name="Sum">4.7  Summary</a></h3>

<p>
Each of the above arguments has two parts. In the first part, one
argues that there is a &ldquo;good&rdquo; theory (one having certain
fruitful consequences). In many cases this theory explicitly includes
(or just is) AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. In the second part, one
shows that all such theories include
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. </p>

<p>
 We want to stress this second part&mdash;the recovery
theorems. Without the recovery theorems one could always wonder
whether there are incompatible axioms with the same fruitful
consequences. In contrast to the case of physics, where one could
never hope to show that the data logically implies the theory, in the
case of the search for new axioms this is in fact possible. It is the
recovery theorems that seal the case. </p>

<p>
 Perhaps the strongest argument in favour of axioms of definable
determinacy is the last. For the results show that there are deep
connections between approaches to new axioms from conceptually
distinct domains and that, remarkably, AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>
is part of the picture provided by each. In short,
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> lies in the overlapping consensus of
all approaches that involve climbing the hierarchy of interpretability
along a natural path. </p>

<h2><a name="PhiDis">5.  Philosophical Discussion</a></h2>

<p>
Let us return to the question of pluralism. Do the above results
collectively provide us with a strong extrinsic justification of
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> and thereby secure non-pluralism at
this level? </p>

<p>
 The pluralist will certainly accept the above results&mdash;after
all, they are mathematical theorems&mdash;but will resist the claim
that they provide us with theoretical reasons for adopting
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>. The pluralist may grant that the
results are quite interesting and that they show that
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> has a certain appeal&mdash;since, for
example, it renders <i>L</i>(&#8477;) a paradise for
analysts&mdash;but they will view this as a practical reason for
adopting AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>, not a theoretical reason. On
this view there are many roads that one can take&mdash;<i>V</i>
= <i>L</i>, AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>, etc.&mdash;and that while
each has its advantages with respect to certain aims there is no
&ldquo;fact of the matter&rdquo; as to which is the correct one, any
more than there is a &ldquo;fact of the matter&rdquo; as to which of
two notations is the correct notation. At this level, according to the
pluralist, no theoretical reasons are at play and there is no issue of
objective mathematical truth. This is the view of Feferman (1999),
Kanamori (2003), Shelah (2003), and many other philosophers and
mathematicians. </p>

<p>
 The non-pluralist regards the above results as collectively
providing very strong theoretical reasons for thinking that
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> holds and that the other, incompatible
alternatives fail. This is the view of Martin (1998), Steel (2000),
Woodin (2005a), many philosophers and mathematicians, and most
descriptive set theorists and inner model theorists. </p>

<p>
 As we mentioned in the introduction, some pluralists and
non-pluralists take realism to be prior to reason while others take
reason to be prior to realism. It is important to keep these two
versions separate and address them individually. </p>

<p>
 Let us start with those who take realism to be prior to reason. To
fix ideas consider the pluralist who accepts realism about the natural
numbers but not about arbitrary subsets of natural numbers and then,
on this basis, concludes that theoretical reasons can be offered in
the case of new axioms in number theory but not in the case of
analysis or set theory. When pressed on the source of this
asymmetrical stance concerning realism in the two domains the
pluralist usually responds by resorting to the intuition that the
natural numbers are &ldquo;clear&rdquo; while the notion of an
arbitrary subset of natural numbers is &ldquo;inherently
vague&rdquo;. To this the non-pluralist might respond that the notion
of clarity is not clear. Intuitions of clarity, like intuitions of
self-evidence, are notoriously vague and subjective and hence a weak
point upon which to rest one's case. </p>

<p>
 Let us now turn to those who take reason to be prior to
realism. People in this category take objectivity to be the hallmark
of realism and they come to their conclusions concerning realism about
a given domain only after one has a good understanding of what kind of
theoretical reasons have traction in that domain. A pluralist who
thinks that theoretical justification in mathematics must ultimately
trace back to axioms which are self-evident will be unmoved by the
above extrinsic case. Likewise for a pluralist who thinks that
theoretical justification in mathematics must ultimately trace back to
axioms that are extrinsically justified. The case we have given is
clearly an extrinsic one. The issue, then, comes down to the
legitimacy of extrinsic justifications. </p>

<p>
 We are certainly not in a position to resolve this debate
here. But it will be helpful to draw a parallel with the debate
between the <em>instrumentalist</em> and <em>non-instrumentalist</em>
in physics. An extreme form of instrumentalism was advanced by the
neo-Kantian Hans Vaihinger in his book <em>The Philosophy of As
If</em> (1911). According to this view, the &ldquo;hard data&rdquo; of
physics consists in the data of our immediate sense impressions. Upon
this basis we are free to construct&mdash;in common sense and in
physics&mdash;a &ldquo;reality&rdquo;, but the result is not genuine
knowledge&mdash;rather, it is a useful fiction for moving around in
everyday life and making predictions in physics. In a similar fashion,
the extreme pluralist takes the &ldquo;hard data&rdquo; to consist of
the theorems that have actually been established and regards
everything else as a useful fiction. </p>

<p>
 In the physical case the non-instrumentalist sees theoretical
reason at play at a much higher-level, far beyond the data. For
example, in the time of Copernicus, when the Ptolemaic and Copernican
theory were observationally indistinguishable, theoretical reasons
could still be given for the Copernican theory over the Ptolemaic
 theory.<sup>[<a href="notes.html#15" name="note-15">15</a>]</sup>
 Similarly in the set theoretic case the non-pluralist sees theoretical
reason at play at higher level, beyond the theorems and the
intrinsically plausible statements. Just as in astronomy the
non-instrumentalist finds evidence of a higher-level structure in the
constellation of connections, likewise in the case of set theory the
non-pluralist takes the constellation of connections in the
interpretability hierarchy&mdash;in particular, the above theorems
concerning AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup>&mdash;as providing evidence
of structure of a higher level. There is, of course, much more to be
said. But we hope to have brought the issues to the fore. </p>

<p>
 It should be mentioned that the non-pluralist about
AD<sup><i>L</i>(&#8477;)</sup> is open to the possibility that
pluralism holds at higher levels, say at the level of CH. For a
treatment of that subject see the entry
 &ldquo;<a href="../continuum-hypothesis/index.html">The Continuum Hypothesis</a>&rdquo;

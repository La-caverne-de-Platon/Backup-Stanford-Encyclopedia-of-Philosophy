 &ldquo;To biology is due the conception of organism&rdquo;, Dewey
wrote. In his view, it was leading psychology to recognize </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
mental life as an organic unitary process developing according to the
laws of all life, and not a theatre for the exhibition of independent
autonomous faculties&hellip;[or] isolated, atomic sensations and
ideas. (&ldquo;The New Psychology&rdquo;, 1884, EW1: 56)</p>
</blockquote>

 &ldquo;The idea of environment&rdquo;, Dewey wrote, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is a necessity to the idea of organism, and with the conception of
environment comes the impossibility of considering psychical life as
an individual, isolated thing developing in a vacuum [but must also
draw upon the nascent] sciences of the origin and development of the
various spheres of man&rsquo;s activity. (&ldquo;The New
Psychology&rdquo;, 1884, EW1: 56&ndash;57)</p>
</blockquote>

 Thus, Dewey proposed to leave behind the reflex arc&rsquo;s patchwork
of stimuli-responses for the more flexible notion of
<em>circuits</em>, the continual reconstitution and adjustment of
organisms-in-environments. Begin, he argued, not with the specious
&ldquo;stimulus&rdquo; (e.g., &ldquo;seeing&rdquo;), but with acts or
&ldquo;sensori-motor coordinations&rdquo;, e.g.,
<em>seeing-for-reaching</em> (&ldquo;The Reflex Arc&rdquo;, 1896, EW5:
100). The &ldquo;response&rdquo; which follows is also thickened;
rather than just &ldquo;reaching&rdquo; it is
<em>reaching-guided-by-seeing</em>. Acts occurs in and through an
<em>environment</em>, one which presents both surprises and problems
productive of growth.</p>

 &ldquo;Any impulse may become organized into almost any disposition
according to the way it interacts with surroundings. Fear may become
abject cowardice, prudent caution, reverence for superiors or respect
for equals&rdquo; (<em>HNC</em>, MW14: 69).</p>

 Earlier figures such as Hume used habit to explain how impressions
eventually lead to complicated things and events. But while Hume
resigned to call habit a &ldquo;mysterious tie&rdquo;, Dewey pointed
to the advances of science to assert that &ldquo;the development of
biological knowledge has now done away with the
&lsquo;mysterious&rsquo; quality of the tie&rdquo; (<em>LTI</em>,
LW12: 244).</p>

 On experience, post-<em>EN</em>, see &ldquo;The Inclusive Philosophic
Idea&rdquo; (1928, LW3), &ldquo;Qualitative Thought&rdquo; (1930c,
LW5), &ldquo;Context and Thought&rdquo; (1931, LW6), &ldquo;Time and
Individuality&rdquo; (1940b, LW14), <em>Logic: The Theory of
Inquiry</em> (1938c, LW12), &ldquo;Experience, Knowledge and Value: A
Rejoinder&rdquo; (1939c, LW14), &ldquo;Experience and Existence: A
Comment&rdquo; (1949, LW16).</p>

 Retaining &ldquo;experience&rdquo; as term central to his philosophy
was risky for Dewey, as it already had a range of meanings ensconced
in western philosophy. He chose this path rather than go down the
(Whiteheadian or Heideggerian) path of neologisms. The challenge for
Dewey&rsquo;s readers is to avoid falling back into older, habitual
connotations; indeed, Dewey quite often intends something radically
different, even converse, to those older senses. Alas, the term caused
no end of confusion for Dewey; in 1951, in an early draft of a new
introduction to <em>EN</em>, he expressed a desire to substitute
&ldquo;culture&rdquo; for &ldquo;experience&rdquo; because of, he
said, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
my growing realization that the historical obstacles which prevented
understanding of my use of &ldquo;experience&rdquo; are, for all
practical purposes, insurmountable. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
However, he added, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
I still believe that on theoretical, as distinct from historical,
grounds there is much to be said in favor of using
&ldquo;experience&rdquo; to designate the inclusive subject-matter
which characteristically &ldquo;modern&rdquo; (post-medieval)
philosophy breaks up into the dualisms of subject and object, mind and
the world, psychological and physical. If &ldquo;experience&rdquo; is
to designate the inclusive subject-matter it must designate both what
is experienced and the ways of experiencing it. (<em>EN</em>, LW1:
361&ndash;62) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Dewey also discussed substituting the phrases
&ldquo;life-behavior&rdquo; or &ldquo;life-activities&rdquo; for
experience. See &ldquo;Experience and Existence: A Comment&rdquo;
(1949, LW16: 386&ndash;87).</p>

 For decades, Rorty rebuked Dewey for his notion of "experience,"
claiming it was both too vague and also superfluous to his criticisms
of the tradition and instrumentalist theory of knowledge. In
Rorty&rsquo;s view, Dewey invented an intermediary between organism
and environment, and lapsed into the very foundationalist habits he
decried; experience was, Rorty said, a fifth wheel, a thing-in-itself
made to battle dualisms (see Rorty 1995: 219 n.10; 1977 [1982:
79&ndash;80]). Toward the end of his own life, Rorty&rsquo;s distaste
reached a zenith: &ldquo;I regard [Dewey&rsquo;s theory of experience]
as the worst part of Dewey. I&rsquo;d be glad if he had never written
<em>Experience and Nature</em>&rdquo; (Rorty 2006: 20). Rorty&rsquo;s student and
leading neopragmatist Robert Brandom has also denounced the term.</p>

<div id="note-11">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-11">11.</a>
 See <em>Democracy and Education</em>: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Mere activity does not constitute experience&hellip;.Experience as
trying involves change, but change is meaningless transition unless it
is consciously connected with the return wave of consequences which
flow from it. When an activity is continued into the undergoing of
consequences, when the change made by action is reflected back into a
change made in us, the mere flux is loaded with significance. We learn
something. (<em>DE</em>, MW9: 146)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-12">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-12">12.</a>
 Other texts explicating this crucial distinction include &ldquo;The
Postulate of Immediate Empiricism&rdquo; (1905, MW3), <em>Experience
and Nature</em> (LW1, especially 26&ndash;27); &ldquo;Qualitative
Thought&rdquo; (1930, LW5, especially 211&ndash;12); and <em>Logic:
The Theory of Inquiry</em>, LW12, especially 74&ndash;75)<em>.</em>
Dewey is not denying the existence of objects as known; he is denying
that <em>all</em> that <em>exists</em> must exist as known: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Things that are <em>had</em> in experience exist prior to reflection
and its eventuation in an object of knowledge; but the latter, as
such, is a deliberately effected re-arrangement or re-disposition, by
means of overt operations, of such antecedent existences. (1930,
&ldquo;In Reply to Some Criticisms&rdquo;, LW5: 212)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-13">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-13">13.</a>
 Dewey&rsquo;s name for this method varies; he calls it, alternately,
the &ldquo;experiential&rdquo;, &ldquo;empirical&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;denotative&rdquo; method, among others.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-14">

 As Browning puts it, &ldquo;bedrock&rdquo; is meant to </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
emphasize the fact that there is nothing more basic or more radical in
[any philosopher&rsquo;s] philosophical systems than this, nothing in
their metaphysics, their political philosophy, their epistemology,
their methodology, and so on. (Browning 1998: 74)</p>

<div id="note-15">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-15">15.</a>
 &ldquo;Postulate of Immediate Empiricism&rdquo; (1905, MW3) rejected
both the idea of a reality-in-itself and knowing as affording special
access to reality, &ldquo;The Subject-matter of Metaphysical
Inquiry&rdquo; (1915, MW8) rejected any metaphysics concerned with
extra-natural or ultimate causes, but created room for one describing
&ldquo;irreducible traits found in any an every subject of scientific
inquiry&rdquo; (1915, MW8: 4), and <em>Essays in Experimental
Logic&rsquo;s</em> &ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; (1916, MW10) detailed
the &ldquo;primary character of non-reflectional experience&rdquo; and
how the &ldquo;intellectual element is set in a context which is
non-cognitive&rdquo;. This context, called a &ldquo;situation&rdquo;,
enlarges as a central metaphysical term in later work. Situations have
both structure and are &ldquo;saturated with a pervasive
quality&rdquo; (1916, MW10: 322, 323).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-16">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-16">16.</a>
 In some very obvious ways, Dewey&rsquo;s is a metaphysics of process.
Events, growth, transformation, and change are central, and Dewey
clearly repudiates object or substance-oriented approaches. But
because he also insists on the method of experience, any &ldquo;sizing
up&rdquo; of reality will be done from a particular standpoint that is
personal, cultural, and historical. Thus, it is incorrect to say,
simply, that Dewey &ldquo;inverts&rdquo; traditional metaphysics by
substituting &ldquo;events&rdquo; for &ldquo;objects&rdquo;, since the
primary &ldquo;sin&rdquo; of metaphysics is the assumption of a
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s-eye view&rdquo; on reality and, almost inevitably,
a reductionistic approach to everything subsumed for explanation.</p>

 Thomas Alexander proposes that <em>EN</em> covers traits such as </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
situation, precarious/stable, qualitative immediacy, relational
mediation, interaction or transaction (exemplified in communication),
selectivity or individuality, continuity and emergence, field (fringe
to focus, exemplified in consciousness), realization or the
consummatory (exemplified in art), and value (intelligent conduct).
(Alexander forthcoming; see also Myers forthcoming)</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-18">18.</a>
 See also &ldquo;Context and Thought&rdquo;, where Dewey wrote, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Philosophy is criticism; criticism of the influential beliefs that
underlie culture; a criticism which traces the beliefs to their
generating conditions as far as may be, which tracks them to their
results, which considers the mutual compatibility of the elements of
the total structure of beliefs. Such an examination terminates,
whether so intended or not, in a projection of them into a new
perspective which leads to new surveys of possibilities. (1931, LW6:
19) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
On Dewey&rsquo;s metaphysics as &ldquo;ground map&rdquo; see Sleeper
1986 and 1992, Boisvert 1988 and 1998a, Fesmire 2015, and Garrison
2005. See also Ortega y Gasset 1966 [1969]: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Metaphysics is not a science; it is a construction of the world, and
this making a world out of what surrounds you is human life. The
world, the universe, is not given to man; what is given to him is his
circumstances, his surroundings, with their numberless contents.
(1969: 121)</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-19">19.</a>
 Reaction to <em>Experience and Nature</em> came from a variety of
critics (George Santayana, Morris Cohen, William E. Hocking) who
attacked the proposed relation between &ldquo;experience&rdquo; and
&ldquo;nature&rdquo;. Because they perceived <em>EN</em> as framing
<em>all</em> non-human nature through the lens of human experience,
Dewey was charged with conflating the immediacy of human experience
with the way things are in the natural world, outside of human
observations and problems. His was an anthropocentric naturalism,
which, by exaggerating the &ldquo;dominance of the foreground&rdquo;
lacked true &ldquo;natural piety&rdquo; and failed to regard nature on
its own accord (see Santayana 1928, LW3: 367&ndash;384).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-20">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-20">20.</a>
 Dewey seemed to be taking two, opposed approaches to reality: on one
hand, nature and human nature were to be understood via the empirical
sciences. It was the <em>relations</em> involved and not the immediate
qualities which gave rise to knowledge. On the other hand, the natural
world was to be understood via &ldquo;experience&rdquo;. It was the
<em>qualities</em> immediately before mind&rsquo;s self-conscious and
rational system responsible for constructing scientific concepts and
even the sciences themselves. Was Dewey a materialistic naturalist or
objective idealist? Critics saw him as waffling. Moreover, they
wondered how Dewey could claim that a single experienced event could
consist in <em>both</em> qualities (immediate, unique) and relations
(mediated, repeatable)?</p>
</div>

<div id="note-21">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-21">21.</a>
 Bernstein claimed that Dewey&rsquo;s theory harbored two
irreconcilable strains, a &ldquo;metaphysical strain&rdquo;, which
talked about <em>all</em> existences, and a &ldquo;phenomenological
strain&rdquo;, which talked about experience. Bernstein argued that
Dewey failed to provide a sufficient robust discussion of the
principle of continuity, proposed by Dewey as bringing together the
experiential and the natural. Thus, for Bernstein, there exists
&ldquo;a deep crack, a basic discontinuity that cuts through his
naturalism&rdquo; (Bernstein 1961: 6). In my view, Thomas Alexander
responds successfully to Bernstein&rsquo;s (and others&rsquo;)
critique in his discussion of Dewey&rsquo;s &ldquo;generic traits of
existence&rdquo;. Alexander wrote, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The quest&hellip;for the generic traits of existence only makes sense
in the context of a culture which has <em>already</em> developed
habits of inquiry, reflection and speculation and encountered the
problematic questions such pursuits raise&hellip;..Even the most
abstract reflective enterprises cannot transcend the world or those
beings who are reflecting&hellip;.Dewey seeks here what might be
called a transcendental or hermeneutic exploration of reflective
experience. What is revealed in the objects of <em>all</em> reflective
experience (&ldquo;theories&rdquo;) is nothing less than that they
have at each and ever moment presupposed the larger world which acts
as their ground, their origin, their material and their true end.
(Alexander 1987: 89&ndash;90) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This response basically rehearses Dewey&rsquo;s proposal for a new
starting point for philosophy, and reflective thought more generally.
In other words, the solution to Bernstein&rsquo;s criticism is already
present in Dewey&rsquo;s &ldquo;denotative method&rdquo;.</p>
</div>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-22">22.</a>
 The term &ldquo;instrumentalism&rdquo; carries some historical
baggage. Some critics complained that Dewey&rsquo;s
&ldquo;instrumentalism&rdquo; implied a cheapening of mental
reflection &mdash; a dismissal of the activity of contemplation, or
the reduction of reflection to a primitive means-end calculus,
typically for the purpose of economic ends. It is hoped that the
account here helps set those impressions aside, again.</p>

 See Dewey&rsquo;s 1912 &ldquo;Contributions to <em>A Cyclopedia of
Education.</em>&rdquo; </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
[Instrumentalism] falls in line with the growing influence of the
theory of evolution, asserting that reality itself is inherently and
not merely accidentally and externally in process of continuous
transition and transformation, and it connects the theory of knowledge
and of logic with this basic fact. It connects with historic spiritual
philosophies in its emphasis upon life, and upon biological and
dynamic conceptions as more fundamental than purely physical and
mathematical ideas. While claiming to be strictly empirical in method,
it gives to thought and thought relations (universals) a primary and
constructive function which sensational empiricism denied them, and
thus claims to have included and explained the factor that historic
rationalisms have stood for. In somewhat similar fashion, it claims to
mediate between realistic and idealistic theories of knowledge. It
holds to reality, prior to cognitive operations and not constructed by
these operations, to which knowing, in order to be successful, must
adapt itself. (1912, MW7: 328)</p>

nature of knowing as part of a biological framework, arguing that
reflective inquiry arises when organisms confront obstacles, whether
these are disruptions of habit or the frustration of unmet needs. The

As philosophers, our disagreements as to conclusions are trivial

 One proposal of Dewey&rsquo;s for integrating school and society
organized pedagogy around community-based &ldquo;occupational

of the basic ingredients, traveling to stores to purchase tools, etc.)
Such &ldquo;occupational projects&rdquo;, not to be confused with
vocational education, directly involved students with experimental

Bernstein comments, </p>

[Dewey] preferred to speak about intelligence and intelligent action.
Intelligence is not the name of a special faculty. Rather, it
designates a cluster of habits and dispositions that includes
attentiveness to details, imagination, and passionate commitment. What

in everyday practices. (Bernstein 2010: 85)</p>

 A reasonable starting list of Dewey&rsquo;s principal ethical
writings would include his <em>Ethics</em> (1908, MW5, revised 1932,
LW7, co-authored with James H. Tufts) as well as <em>Human Nature and
Conduct</em> (1922, <em>HNC</em>, MW14) and <em>Theory of
Valuation</em> (1939, LW13); the essay &ldquo;Three Independent
Factors in Morals&rdquo; (1930, <em>TIF</em>, LW5: 279&ndash;88) is
also very significant. Dewey&rsquo;s writings cover a range of ethical
approaches which cover descriptive ethics, metaethics, normative
ethics, and applied ethics. Perhaps most distinctive among his efforts
is his theory of moral experience.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-36">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-36">36.</a>
 Dewey offered no comprehensive, situation-independent, theory about
permanent values or goods. He thought that expecting permanent
solutions to ongoing and novel moral perplexities was regressive and
unscientific. In the case of values, as well as in the case of
actions, the proper response to a perplexity is inquiry, which can
reconsider and reconstruct goods, values, and ends (<em>E-rev</em>,
LW7: 164). Dewey did distinguish immediate experiences of value and
reflective judgments about value &mdash; but was quick to insist that
one must not confuse the first (a had enjoyment of a value) with the
second (a reflective endorsement of it) (QC, LW4: 207&ndash;08). In
brief, there is no intuitive way to permanently identify an
&ldquo;is&rdquo; from an &ldquo;ought&rdquo; because each instance
always manifests in a specific, problematic situation. In such
situations, the best course is intelligent inquiry combining a
radically empirical attention to the present with the best past
understanding about what has already been discovered to be valuable.
Dewey wrote, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
In short, a truly moral (or right) act is one which is intelligent in
an emphatic and peculiar sense; it is a reasonable act. It is not
merely one which is thought of, and thought of as good, at the moment
of action, but one which will continue to be thought of as
&ldquo;good&rdquo; in the most alert and persistent reflection.
(<em>E</em>, MW5: 278&ndash;79)</p>

 In morals, Dewey wrote, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
The end is&hellip;.the active process of transforming the existent
situation. Not perfection as a final goal, but the ever-enduring
process of perfecting, maturing, refining is the aim in living.
Honesty, industry, temperance, justice, like health, wealth and
learning, are not goods to be possessed as they would be if they
expressed fixed ends to be attained. They are directions of change in
the quality of experience. Growth itself is the only moral
&ldquo;end&rdquo;. (<em>RIP</em>, MW12: 181)</p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-38">38.</a>
 Dewey, along with his colleague G.H. Mead, developed a conception of
the self as social. A cumulative process of socialization, involving
many activities but especially discourse contributes to and
constitutes who we are as individuals. Dewey wrote, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Cooperation, in all kinds of enterprises, interchange of services and
goods, participation in social arts, associations for various
purposes, institutions of blood, family, government, and religion, all
add enormously to the individual&rsquo;s power. On the other hand, as
he enters into these relations and becomes a &ldquo;member&rdquo; of
all these bodies he inevitably undergoes a transformation in his
interests. Psychologically the process is one of building up a
&ldquo;social&rdquo; self. Imitation and suggestion, sympathy and
affection, common purpose and common interest, are the aids in
building such a self. (<em>E</em>, MW5: 16; see also 388).</p>

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-39">39.</a>
 The ethical traditions&rsquo; approach to conflict was, for Dewey, a
crucial (and damning) commonality between them. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Whatever may be the differences which separate moral theories, all
postulate one single principle as an explanation of moral life. Under
such conditions, it is not possible to have either uncertainty or
conflict: morally speaking, the conflict is only specious and
apparent. Conflict is, in effect, between good and evil, justice and
injustice, duty and caprice, virtue and vice, and is not an inherent
part of the good, the obligatory, the virtuous. (<em>TIF</em>, LW5:
280)</p>

 Dewey, recall, took aim at this fundamental metaphysical prejudice
(equating what is real with what is certain) in EN. His naturalism
accepts that existence (not just subjective perception) really is a
mixture of the &ldquo;precarious&rdquo; and &ldquo;stable&rdquo;.
Insofar as we are natural actors in a natural world, this is also
where ethical theory should start rather than trying to purify out a
single chief value or end. In <em>HNC</em>, Dewey wrote, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Potentially conduct is one hundred per cent of our acts. Hence we must
decline to admit theories which identify morals with the purification
of motives, edifying character, pursuing remote and elusive
perfection, obeying supernatural command, acknowledging the authority
of duty. Such notions have a dual bad effect. First they get in the
way of observation of conditions and consequences. They divert thought
into side issues. Secondly, while they confer a morbid exaggerated
quality upon things which are viewed under the aspect of morality,
they release the larger part of the acts of life from serious, that is
moral, survey. Anxious solicitude for the few acts which are deemed
moral is accompanied by edicts of exemption and baths of immunity for
most acts. A moral moratorium prevails for everyday affairs.

the ability to make delicate distinctions, to perceive aspects of good
and of evil not previously noticed, to take into account the fact that
doubt and the need for choice impinge at every turn. (<em>TIF</em>,
LW5: 280) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
By advancing in these empirical ways, Dewey noted, theory goes beyond
mere conceptual analysis or exhortation and reveals alternatives and
their consequences. Theory serves as &ldquo;an instrument for
rendering deliberation more effective and hence choice more
intelligent&rdquo; (<em>E-rev</em>, LW7: 316).</p>

keep some of the elements of past philosophies. Philosophers such as
Plato, Hume, and Kant (to name three) reward inquiry with their
ability to </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
reveal the complexity of moral situations&hellip;[so as] to bring to
light some phase of [our] moral life demanding reflective attention,

plan&hellip;.[W]e find ourselves in imagination in the presence of the
consequences that would follow; and as we then like and approve, or
dislike and disapprove, these consequences, we find the original
impulse or plan good or bad. Deliberation is dramatic and active, not
mathematical and impersonal. (<em>E</em>, MW5: 292, 293)</p>

 As he laid out in his psychology, education, and ethical writings,
political (and economic) individuals are not ontologically prior to
social groups but exist <em>in and through</em> transactions with
them. &ldquo;Assured and integrated individuality is the product of
definite social relationships and publicly acknowledged
functions&rdquo; (<em>ION</em>, LW5: 67). While everyone has private
thoughts and experiences, these are not proofs against the sociality
inherent in individual experience for it is &ldquo;only in social
groups does a person have a chance to develop individuality&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Individuality in Education&rdquo;, MW15: 176). Nevertheless,
Dewey is on guard against the absorption of the individual into the
larger social collective, which he sees as destructive of
individuals-as-as such. Against domineering social systems, Dewey
wrote, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Individuality is inexpugnable because it is a manner of distinctive
sensitivity, selection, choice, response and utilization of
conditions. For this reason, if for no other, it is impossible to
develop integrated individuality by any all-embracing system or
program. (<em>ION</em>, LW5: 121)</p>

experience and education. All ends and values that are cut off from
the ongoing process become arrests, fixations. They strive to fixate
what has been gained instead of using it to open the road and point
the way to new and better experiences. (&ldquo;Creative

 In 1930, Dewey writes of a profound crisis engulfing modern persons,
the &ldquo;lost individual&rdquo; of his famous chapter in
<em>Individualism</em> (<em>ION</em>, LW5: 66&ndash;76). A number of
impingements &mdash; mass production and consumption, the hegemony of
business institutions, exponential increases of information produced
by journalism, e.g. &mdash; were speeding up the pace of life,
fomenting economic insecurity, and undermining &ldquo;the loyalties
which once held individuals, which gave them support, direction and
unity of outlook on life&rdquo; (<em>ION</em>, LW5: 66). Writing just
after the Great Depression, Dewey diagnosed these corrosive conditions
as &ldquo;an acute maladjustment between individuals and [their]
social conditions&rdquo;. &ldquo;Where fears abound&rdquo;, he wrote,
&ldquo;courageous and robust individuality is undermined&rdquo;

 Early colonists&rsquo; opposition to government power had backfired,
Dewey argued, because merely calling for restrain (&ldquo;negative
liberty&rdquo;) had elevated the &ldquo;wants and endeavors of private
individuals seeking personal gain to the place of supreme authority in
social life&rdquo; (&ldquo;Authority and Social Change&rdquo;, LW11:
136). Thus, liberalism, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
in the very act of asserting that it stood completely and loyally for
the principle of individual freedom, was really engaged in justifying
the activities of a new form of concentrated [economic power,
which]&hellip;has consistently and persistently denied effective
freedom to the economically underpowered and underprivileged.

 The whole passage is worth citing. Dewey wrote, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
Art is the living and concrete proof that man is capable of restoring
consciously, and thus on the plane of meaning, the union of sense,
need, impulse and action characteristic of the live creature. The
intervention of consciousness adds regulation, power of selection, and
re-disposition. Thus it varies the arts in ways without end. But its
intervention also leads in time to the idea of art as a conscious
idea&mdash;the greatest intellectual achievement in the history of
humanity. (<em>AE</em>, LW10: 31)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-52">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-52">52.</a>
 Regarding ontology, Dewey&rsquo;s anti-essentialist answer to
&ldquo;What is art?&rdquo; is that <em>as</em> experience, art is not
simply locatable in an object, or event, or subject. Rather,
&ldquo;art&rdquo; denotes the <em>interaction</em> of (a) making
(artist activity), (b) an event or thing (song, painting, etc.) and
(c) an appreciator (listener, viewer, etc.). He distinguishes (b) as
&ldquo;art products&rdquo; (the physical object, e.g.) but says that
&ldquo;the real work of art&rdquo; is (a)+(b)+(c): &ldquo;the building
up of an integral experience out of the interaction of organic and
environmental conditions and energies&rdquo; (<em>AE</em>, LW10: 70;
see also 167, 218, 223). Regarding interpretation and criticism, their
function complements the experiential definition of art; they are
situational and fallible, never seeking final, definitive judgments
about a work&rsquo;s meaning or value. Their aim is to widen and
deepen aesthetic experience. &ldquo;The function of criticism&rdquo;,
Dewey wrote, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
is the reeducation of perception of works of art; it is an auxiliary
in the process, a difficult process, of learning to see and
hear&hellip;.The way to help [someone seeking to understand art] is
through the expansion of his own experience by the work of art to
which criticism is subsidiary. (<em>AE</em>, LW10: 328)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-53">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-53">53.</a>
 In Dewey&rsquo;s terminology, &ldquo;<em>an</em>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;consummatory&rdquo; experience is conscious, deeply meaningful,
and integrated as a whole. Its character is unique enough that we
recognize it as distinct and special. The opposite kind of experience
he called &ldquo;anesthetic&rdquo;, and it is marked by a dispersed,
inchoate, or even hum-drum quality (<em>AE</em>, LW10: 42, 47).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-54">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-54">54.</a>
 As with psychology, education, morality, and other subject matters,
Dewey looked to organic sources to understand art&rsquo;s functions
and effects. Art engages our physical, sensory, and psychic abilities,
and what we call an &ldquo;aesthetic experience&rdquo; is the result
of an organism-environment transaction. &ldquo;In a growing
life&rdquo;, Dewey wrote, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
the recovery [of unison with the environment] is never mere return to
a prior state, for it is enriched by the state of disparity and
resistance through which it has successfully passed. (<em>AE</em>,
LW10: 19) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
These facts, he says, &ldquo;reach to the roots of the esthetic in
experience&rdquo;, for when life is able to survive and grow, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
there is an overcoming of factors of opposition and conflict; there is
a transformation of them into differentiated aspects of a higher
powered and more significant life. (<em>AE</em>, LW10: 20) </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Aesthetic concepts and fine-grained meanings are rooted, then, in the
organism&rsquo;s rhythmic and ongoing adjustments of sense. This
supplies aesthetics with a natural basis and sets the task for a
theory of art: explain how aesthetic phenomena (including artworks)
are implicit in everyday experience, and how they might be
expanded.</p>
</div>

<div id="note-55">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-55">55.</a>
 Dewey&rsquo;s examples press these connections. One can find the same
kind of aesthetic experience in a museum&rsquo;s painting, Dewey says,
by looking to experience, </p>

<blockquote>

<p>
in the raw&hellip;in the events and scenes that hold the attentive eye
and ear of man, arousing his interest and affording him enjoyment as
he looks and listens: the sights that hold the crowd&mdash;the
fire-engine rushing by; the machines excavating enormous holes in the
earth; the human-fly climbing the steeple-side; the men perched high
in air on girders, throwing and catching red-hot bolts. (<em>AE</em>,
LW10: 10&ndash;11)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="note-56">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-56">56.</a>
 Dewey rejected &ldquo;militant atheism&rdquo; for its dogmatic
assurance that humans were alone in an alien and hostile world; such a
view lacked &ldquo;natural piety&rdquo;, a felt sensitivity to
one&rsquo;s place in the larger environment. All could cultivate this
kind of piety and it is necessary, Dewey argued, for moral growth
(<em>ACF</em>, LW9: 18).</p>
</div>

<div id="note-57">

<p>

 <a href="index-2.html#ref-57">57.</a>
 Dewey&rsquo;s views about religious experience echo others about
aesthetic experience, where experiences possessing uniquely
qualitative characters become entangled with outmoded conceptual
structures and institutions (museum, church, etc.). Emancipating such
experiences could, Dewey thought, allow them to inform (and transform)
more of everyday life (See <em>ACF</em>, LW9: 8 ff.).</p>

relate not to this and that want in relation to this and that
condition of our surroundings, but pertain to our being in its
entirety. Because of their scope, this modification of ourselves is
enduring. It lasts through any amount of vicissitude of circumstances,
internal and external. There is a composing and harmonizing of the
various elements of our being such that, in spite of changes in the
special conditions that surround us, these conditions are also
arranged, settled, in relation to us. (<em>ACF</em>, LW9:

community in which we are a link. Ours is the responsibility of
conserving, transmitting, rectifying and expanding the heritage of
values we have received that those who come after us may receive it
more solid and secure, more widely accessible and more generously
shared than we have received it. Here are all the elements for a
religious faith that shall not be confined to sect, class, or race.
